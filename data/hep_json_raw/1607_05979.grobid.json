Two exclusive final states are considered, with either exactly one or at least two tau leptons. No excess over the Standard Model prediction is observed in the data. Results are interpreted in the context of gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking and a simplified model of gluino pair production with tau-rich cascade decays, substantially improving on previous limits. In the GMSB model considered, supersymmetry-breaking scale ( ) values below 92 TeV are excluded at the 95% confidence level, corresponding to gluino masses below 2000 GeV. For large values of tan \u03b2, values of up to 107 TeV and gluino masses up to 2300 GeV are excluded. In the simplified model, gluino masses are excluded up to 1570 GeV for neutralino masses around 100 GeV. Neutralino masses below 700 GeV are excluded for all gluino masses between 800 and 1500 GeV, while the strongest exclusion of 750 GeV is achieved for gluino masses around 1450 GeV.",

Squarks (q), gluinos (g), sleptons (\u02dc ) and sneutrinos (\u03bd) are the superpartners of the quarks, gluons, charged leptons and neutrinos, respectively. The SUSY partners of the gauge and Higgs bosons are called gauginos and higgsinos, respectively. The charged electroweak gaugino and higgsino states mix to form charginos (\u03c7 \u00b1 i , i = 1, 2), and the neutral states mix to form neutralinos (\u03c7 0 j , j = 1, 2, 3, 4). Finally, the gravitino (G) is the SUSY partner of the graviton. As no supersymmetric particle has been observed, SUSY must be a broken symmetry. In general, the minimal supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) allows couplings which violate baryon-and lepton-number conservation, leading to, for example, a short proton lifetime. To ensure accordance with established measurements, R-parity [7][8][9][10][11] conservation is often assumed. In this scenario, sparticles are produced in pairs and decay through cascades involving SM particles and other sparticles until the lightest sparticle (LSP), which is stable, is produced.",

            "text": "In GMSB models [16][17][18], SUSY breaking is communicated from a hidden sector to the visible sector by a set of messenger fields that share the gauge interactions of the SM. SUSY is spontaneously broken in the messenger sector, leading to massive, non-degenerate messenger fields. Gauginos acquire their masses via one-loop diagrams involving messengers. Squarks and sleptons, which do not couple directly to the messenger sector, get their masses from two-loop diagrams involving messengers and SM gauge bosons, or messengers and gauginos. The free parameters of GMSB models are the SUSY-breaking mass scale in the messenger sector ( ), the messenger mass scale (M mes ), the number of messenger multiplets (N 5 ) of the 5 +5 representation of SU (5), the ratio of the two Higgs-doublet vacuum expectation values at the electroweak scale (tan \u03b2), the sign of the Higgsino mass term in the superpotential (sign(\u03bc) = \u00b11), and a gravitinomass scale factor (C grav ). Masses of gauginos and sfermions are proportional to , and scale as N 5 and \u221a N 5 , respectively. The M mes scale is required to be larger than , to avoid tachyonic messengers and charge-and colour-breaking vacua, and lower than the Planck mass to suppress flavour violation. The latter condition implies that the lightest supersymmetric particle is a very light gravitino. The C grav parameter, which results from the mechanism communicating SUSY breaking to the messengers, mainly affects the decay rate of the nextto-lightest supersymmetric particle (NLSP) into the LSP.",

The analysis makes use of loose and medium tau leptons, corresponding to identification working points with efficiencies of 60 and 55% for one-track tau leptons, respectively, and 50 and 40% for three-track tau leptons, respectively. Electrons mis-identified as 1-track tau leptons are rejected by imposing a p T -and |\u03b7|-dependent requirement on the electron likelihood, which provides a constant efficiency of 95% for real tau leptons, with an inverse background efficiency (rejection factor) for electrons ranging from 30 to 150 depending on the |\u03b7| region. The missing transverse momentum vector p miss T , whose magnitude is denoted by E miss T , is defined as the negative vector sum of the transverse momenta of all identified physics objects (electrons, muons, jets, and tau leptons) and an additional soft-term. Therefore, the E miss T calculation benefits from the dedicated calibration for each finalstate object. The soft-term is constructed from all the tracks with p T > 400 MeV originating from the primary vertex which are not associated with any physics object. This trackbased definition makes the soft-term largely insensitive to pile-up [77].",

In the following, the associated SRs are called Compressed, Medium-Mass and High-Mass SRs, respectively. The Compressed SR exploits topologies where a highp T jet from initial-state radiation (ISR) recoils against the pair of gluinos. In this situation, the soft visible particles produced in the gluino decay receive a transverse Lorentz boost. While tau leptons and jets from gluino decays typically have low p T , such events have substantial E miss T since both LSPs tend to be emitted oppositely to the ISR jet in the transverse plane. In the case of large mass splitting, highp T jets come mainly from gluino decays, and a highp T requirement on the first two leading jets is effective in rejecting background without inducing a large inefficiency for the signal.

The Compressed SR imposes a requirement on m \u03c4 \u03c4 T2 to exploit the fact that most of SM background contributions exhibit a kinematic endpoint around the W or Z boson mass, which is not the case for tau leptons produced in the cascade decay of gluinos. A requirement is also applied on m sum T to take advantage of the large E miss T and the large jet and tau lepton multiplicity that is expected for signal events. The High-Mass SR includes a requirement on H T , which is efficient for High-Mass gluino signals. A requirement on m \u03c4 1 T + m \u03c4 2 T is also applied. In Z (\u03c4 \u03c4 )+jets events, where E miss T originates from neutrinos from tau lepton decays, the trigger plateau requirement selects events with a highp T Z boson recoiling against jets in the transverse plane. This topology leads to tau leptons with a small \u03c6 separation, which results in low values of m \u03c4 1 T + m \u03c4 2 T given that tau neutrinos are themselves collimated with the visible decay products of tau leptons.

A signal region is also defined for the GMSB model, and targets more specifically squark-antisquark production rather than gluino pair production in the region 80 TeV, not excluded by Run 1 searches. Among the distinctive features that give large discrimination power to H T , decay chains are potentially longer than in the simplified model, and the almost-massless gravitino LSP leaves more phase space to other particles in the decay.

The former includes cross-section uncertainties, which are not relevant for the dominant backgrounds normalised to data, and generator modelling uncertainties. The latter refers to all the uncertainties related to the reconstruction, identification, calibration and corrections applied to jets, tau leptons, electrons, muons and missing transverse momentum. Specific uncertainties are evaluated for the multi-jet background, which is estimated from data. Theoretical uncertainties are evaluated for all simulated samples. For backgrounds that are normalised in CRs, the uncertainty in the transfer factors, i.e. the ratio of the expected event yields in a SR or VR over the respective CR, is evaluated for all SRs and VRs. The difference between the nominal simulation and the systematically varied sample is used as an additional uncertainty. For backgrounds that are evaluated from simulation alone, i.e. the diboson background, a global normalisation uncertainty is added. Uncertainties for V +jets samples generated with Sherpa are estimated by up and down variations by factors of two and one-half in the renormalisation and factorisation scales, resummation scale (maximum scale of the additional emission to be resummed by the parton shower) and CKKW matching scale (matching between matrix elements and parton shower). The effect of scale variations is parameterised at generator level as a function of the vector boson p T and the number of particle jets. For the top quark background, the nominal predictions from Powheg-Box + Pythia6 are compared with predictions from alternative generators, and the differences are taken as systematic uncertainties. The MG5_aMC@NLO + Her-wig++ generators are used to evaluate uncertainties in the modelling of the hard scattering, parton shower and hadronisation. The Powheg-Box + Herwig++ generators are used to compute a specific uncertainty in the parton shower and hadronisation models. An uncertainty in the ISR modelling is also assessed by varying the Powheg-Box parameter which controls the transverse momentum of the first additional parton emission beyond the Born configuration. In the case of the diboson background, a 6% uncertainty in the cross section due to scale and PDF uncertainties is considered. Uncertainties in signal cross sections are obtained by using different PDF sets and factorisation and renormalisation scales, as discussed in Sect. 3.",

An overall uncertainty in the jet energy resolution is  Systematic uncertainties affecting correctly identified tau leptons arise from the reconstruction, identification and tau-electron overlap-removal efficiencies, and the energy scale calibration [75]. Most of the uncertainties are estimated by varying nominal parameters in the simulation: detector material, underlying event, hadronic shower model, pile-up and noise in the calorimeters. The uncertainty in the energy scale also includes non-closure of the calibration found in simulation, a single-pion response uncertainty, and an uncertainty in the in-situ energy calibration of data with respect to simulation derived in Z (\u03c4 \u03c4 ) events with a hadronically decaying tau lepton and a muon in the final state. In the case of signal samples, which undergo fast calorimeter simulation, a dedicated uncertainty takes into account the difference in performance between full and fast simulation. The effect of mis-identified tau leptons is largely constrained by the background estimation approaches. Uncertainties arise due to the extrapolation from the CRs to the VRs and SRs. These are considered as part of the theory uncertainties, which account for the impact of hadronisation on the mis-identification of jets as tau leptons.  Systematic uncertainties affecting electrons and muons are related to the energy or momentum calibration, as well as efficiency corrections for the reconstruction, identification and isolation requirements.

For the simplified model, exclusion contours are shown for the 1\u03c4 and 2\u03c4 channels and their combination. The combination is performed by selecting, for each signal scenario, the SR with the lowest expected CL s value. The combination retains the Compressed SR of the 1\u03c4 channel in the region where the LSP mass is close to the gluino mass, and favours the High-Mass SR of the 2\u03c4 channel when the mass splitting is large. For the GMSB model, limits are shown for the GMSB SR of the 2\u03c4 channel. The stronger limits at high values of tan \u03b2 are explained by the nature of the NSLP, which is the lightest scalar tau in this region. For both models, the exclusion limits obtained with 3.2 fb \u22121 of collision data at \u221a s = 13 TeV significantly improve upon the previous ATLAS results [14,19] established with 20.3 fb \u22121 of 8 TeV data.",

Values of below 92 TeV are excluded at the 95% CL, corresponding to gluino masses below 2000 GeV. A stronger exclusion is achieved for large values of tan \u03b2, where and gluino mass values are excluded up to 107 TeV and 2300 GeV, respectively. In the simplified model, gluino masses are excluded up to 1570 GeV for neutralino masses around 100 GeV, neutralino masses below 700 GeV are excluded for all gluino masses between 800 and 1500 GeV, while the strongest neutralino-mass exclusion of 750 GeV is achieved for gluino masses around 1450 GeV. A dedicated signal region provides good sensitivity to scenarios with a small mass difference between the gluino and the neutralino LSP.",
