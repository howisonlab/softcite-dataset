For this purpose a series of measurements were made in COMPASS, using 160 GeV/c longitudinally polarized muon beam and polarized 6 LiD and NH 3 targets and are foreseen with 190 GeV/c \u03c0 \u2212 beam on polarized NH 3 . The experimental results obtained by COMPASS for azimuthal effects in SIDIS play an important role in the general understanding of the three-dimensional nature of the nucleon and are widely used in theoretical analyses and global data fits. Future first ever polarized DY-data from COMPASS compared with SIDIS results will open a new chapter probing general principles of QCD TMD-formalism. In this review main focus will be given to the very recent COMPASS results obtained for SIDIS transverse spin asymmetries from four \"Drell-Yan\" Q 2 -ranges.",

In the Eq. 1 target transverse polarization (S T ) is defined relative to the virtual photon momentum direction (most natural basis from the theory point of view) while, in experiment transverse polarization of the target is defined relative to the beam (incoming lepton) direction. As it was demonstrated in [1], [13] this difference, in particular, influences azimuthal distributions in the final state. In the appropriately modified expression for the SIDIS cross-section for transversely (w.r.t. lepton beam) polarized target [11], [12] one can find new sin\u03b8-scaled terms and \u03b8dependent factors (\u03b8 is the angle between \u03b3 * -direction and initial lepton momenta in lab. frame) and see that some TSAs are getting mixed up with longitudinal spin asymmetries (LSA). Anyway, since \u03b8 is rather small in COMPASS kinematics the influence of the additional terms and factors can be neglected in most of the cases. Essentially, one can can derive following relation between the correct TSAs and those extracted from the fit using \"Eq. 1\"-approach and therefore mixed with specific LSAs because of the \u03b3 * p \u2192 lp transition: A T \u2248 A T, f it \u2212 C (\u03b5) A L .
