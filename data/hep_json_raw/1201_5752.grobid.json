The key to the detection of these B signals in ATLAS is to achieve a high trigger efficiency for low-p T di-muon events, whilst keeping an acceptable trigger rate. ATLAS developed two separate approaches for triggering on di-muon events from resonances such as J/\u03c8 and Upsilon (\u03a5). The first approach is to start from a di-muon trigger selected at Level-1 while the second is based on dedicated Level-2 algorithms. The performance for these triggers has been studied using collision data at \u221a s = 7 TeV collected in 2011.",

Closest to the beam pipe are silicon based tracking detectors and straw-tube transition radiation detectors, located inside a superconducting solenoid that provides a 2T magnetic field. Outside the solenoid, fine-granularity LAr electromagnetic (EM) calorimeters with an accordion geometry provide coverage up to |\u03b7| < 3.2. An iron-scintillating hadronic calorimeter extends to |\u03b7| < 1.7 while copper and LAr technology is used in the endcap region covering the region 1.7 < |\u03b7| < 3.2. In the very forward region, 3.2 < |\u03b7| < 4.5, copper and tungsten LAr calorimeters provide measurements of the EM and hadronic showers. The Muon Spectrometer (MS) consists of three superconducting toroidal magnets with precision tracking provided by Monitored Drift Tubes (MDT) up to |\u03b7| < 2.4 and Cathode Strip Chambers (CSC) in the very forward region. Triggering for muons is provided using Resistive Plate Chambers (RPC) in barrel region and Thin Gap Chambers (TGC) in the forward region up to |\u03b7| < 2.4. The ATLAS detectors provide input to the three levels of the trigger system that provides fast filtering capabilities and capture events of interest to physics with high efficiency. The ATLAS Trigger System is designed to reduce the output storage rate to 200 Hz (about 300 MB/sec) from an initial LHC bunch crossing rate of 40 MHz. The first level trigger, Level-1 (L1), is hardware based. The L1 receives its inputs from the Calorimeter, Muon and additional forward detectors and provides a decision with a latency of less than 2.5 \u00b5s. So-called Regions of Interest (RoIs) are defined around the L1 signatures; the L2 algorithms (which also access inner tracking information) operate only in these regions, reducing the time taken for the L2 decision to be made.

            "text": "The output rate of the L1 trigger at a luminosity of 10 33 cm \u22122 s \u22121 is expected to contain about 20 kHz of events where one muon exceeded the transverse momentum (p T ) threshold of 6 GeV/c. In 2010 it has been possible to include even lower p T thresholds, down to the lowest threshold achievable in the Level 1 hardware. At L2 this rate of events must be reduced to 1-2 kHz, of which 5-10 % are available for channels of interest only to B-physics. Currently this goal is achieved for L2 muon triggers by first confirming that a muon over the nominal threshold is reconstructed in the MS, and then confirming that there is a matching track in the ID. This selection criterion removes many muons from K and \u03c0 decays, but does not by itself produce the required rate reduction. To achieve the required rate p T thresholds need to be raised and many interesting B-events are likely to be filtered out. To achieve high efficiency for these signals at L2, specific di-muon trigger algorithms were developed. Since most of the relevant processes involve a di-muon (either directly from the B-hadron in the case of rare decays, or via a J/\u03c8, \u03c8(2s), or an \u03a5) a significant proportion of the heavy flavour and quarkonia decays falling in the detector acceptance can be captured by ATLAS. There are two possible approaches at L2 for selecting di-muon events from a resonance such as J/\u03c6 and \u03a5. The first is to start from a selected di-muon trigger at L1. In this approach each muon is confirmed separately, and the invariant mass of the pair can then be calculated and a mass window cut applied. This trigger will be referred to as the \"topological di-muon trigger\". An alternative approach is to start with a L1 single muon trigger and search for the second muon track inside a wide \u03b7 \u2212 \u03c6 region of the ID and then extrapolating the track to the MS to tag muon tracks. Since this method does not explicitly require the second muon at L1, it has an advantage for reconstructing J/\u03c8 even if the second muon has a p T lower than the lowest L1 threshold. This trigger will be referred to as the \"TrigDiMuon'. The basic ideas for this two approaches (topological and TrigDiMuon) are illustrated in Fig. 2.",

The latter term ( (T 1\u00b5 |T 2\u00b5 )) is equal to unity for topological trigger and close to unity for the TrigDiMuon trigger. The (T 1\u00b5 ) term has been obtained with the Tag and Probe method using 2011 data with the same procedure described in [3]. The conditional probabilities can be measured directly from data -in particular, the efficiency (T 2\u00b5 |T 1\u00b5 ) corresponds to the number of events for which both T 2\u00b5 and T 1\u00b5 fired, divided by the total number of events that passed the T 1\u00b5 trigger threshold.
