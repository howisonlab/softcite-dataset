For the Phase 2 CMS tracker, the rate of spurious merging of vertices begins to become significant for vertices separated by less than one mm. For an average number of collisions per bunch-crossing of 140-200, it has been shown that the fraction of spurious tracks from pileup collisions associated with the reconstructed primary vertex is between 20 and 30%. With the addition of a time measurement for tracks, this fraction of spurious track-to-vertex association is reduced to about 5% [1]. As a result, significant improvements on the efficiency for particle identification, including isolated leptons and photons, forward jet identification, as well as missing transverse energy resolution recovery, are expected.",

In this paper, we complement those studies by enabling the reconstruction of the masses of long-lived exotic charged particles or heavy stable charged particles (HSCP) by using the position of the production vertex, the time-of-flight, and the track momentum. The resonance mass reconstruction yields a uniquely enhanced capability to identify new particles and to suppress backgrounds for searches of long-lived exotic particles. We discuss methods for reconstructing the time of the primary collision vertex and strategies for using the resulting time-of-arrival measurement to infer the mass of the HSCP. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods by evaluating the vertex time resolution and the mass resolution, and we show that an improvement in search sensitivity of a factor of 5-10 can be achieved for HSCP masses above 300 GeV.",

The tracker allows a measurement of the track length with a typical relative resolution of order 10 \u22123 . However, only the absolute time-of-arrival of the particle at the point where the particle trajectory intersects the timing detector layer is measured. In order to measure the TOF between the particle production vertex (inner point) and the impact point on the timing detector layer (outer point), the time of the collision that produced the charged particle must be obtained. The naive approach of using the bunch-crossing time as the reference time will yield a resolution not better than 160 ps, due to the spread in time of the collision beam-spot. Instead, we developed a method that precisely reconstructs the space-time coordinate of all vertices. This allows a velocity measurement to be made for all tracks which can be associated to a vertex. Once associated to a vertex, the vertex time is considered as the production time of the particle and it is used to compute the TOF.",

Mis-measurement of the vertex time and the arrival time of the charged particle both contribute, and are dominated by the effect of the time resolution of the time-of-arrival detector. These time mis-measurements result in an exponentially decaying shape for the charged particle mass distribution for the dominant QCD multijet background. Figure 9.

In figure 12, we show an example of signal and background pseudo-data generated for 12 fb \u22121 of integrated luminosity for proton-proton collisions at a center of mass energy of 14 TeV, and an assumed top squark mass of 500 GeV and production cross section of 100 fb. Fits of the signal and background in the single and two particle categories are performed simultaneously using the models described in section 5.3. Using the asymptotic approximation [19] we derive the 95% confidence level expected exclusion limits using the CLs method [20] for long-lived top squark production with lifetime sufficiently large that the top squark is stable over the full detector volume of the CMS detector. The expected limit for 12 fb \u22121 of integrated luminosity is shown in figure 13 and compared to the best existing CMS limits [6]. We show that the sensitivity of this analysis using the TOF measurement is better than limits that do not use timing information for top squark masses above about 170 GeV. The expected limit for our analysis improves more sharply as the top squark mass increases because the larger mass results in slower velocities and increased time delay, which our analysis is sensitive to, while the sensitivity of the best existing CMS limits are less dependent on the top squark mass. Therefore, the improvement over the existing CMS limits is generally enhanced for larger top squark masses and ranges from a factor of 5 to 10. We also compare the expected limit at 1 ab \u22121 of integrated luminosity between the baseline scenario using the H T trigger and the scenario where we employ TOF measurements in the trigger, and we observe that at top squark mass below 200 GeV the TOF-based trigger improves the sensitivity by a factor of 2 to 5.",
