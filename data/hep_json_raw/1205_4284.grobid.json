The two-photon decay branching fractions are determined to be B(\u03c7c0 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3) = (2.24 \u00b1 0.19 \u00b1 0.12 \u00b1 0.08)\u00d710 \u22124 and B(\u03c7c2 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3) = (3.21\u00b10.18\u00b10.17\u00b10.13)\u00d710 \u22124 .

            "text": "Charmonium physics is in the boundary domain between perturbative and nonperturbative quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Notably, the two-photon decays of P -wave charmonia are helpful for better understanding the nature of interquark forces and decay mechanisms [1]. In particular, the decays of \u03c7 c0,2 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 offer the closest parallel between quantum electrodynamics (QED) and QCD, being completely analogous to the decays of the corresponding triplet states of positronium. In the lowest order, for both positronium and charmonium the ratio of the two-photon decays R (0) th \u2261 \u0393( 3 P2\u2192\u03b3\u03b3) \u0393( 3 P0\u2192\u03b3\u03b3) = 4/15 \u2248 0.27 [2]. Any discrepancy from this simple lowest order prediction can arise due to QCD radiative correc-tions and relativistic corrections, and the measurement of R provides useful information on these effects. The decay of \u03c7 c1 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 is forbidden by the Landau-Yang theorem [3]. Theoretical predictions on the decay rates are obtained using a non-relativistic approximation [4,5], potential model [6], relativistic quark model [7,8], nonrelativistic QCD factorization framework [9], effective Lagrangian [10], as well as lattice calculations [11]. The predictions for the ratio R \u2261 \u0393\u03b3\u03b3 (\u03c7c2) \u0393\u03b3\u03b3 (\u03c7c0) cover a wide range values between 0.09 and 0.36 [6,8]. Precision measurements of these quantities will guide the development of QCD theory.",

The photon detection efficiency and its uncertainty for low energy photons are studied using three different methods described in Ref. [28]. On average, the efficiency difference between data and MC simulation is less than 1% [28]. The momenta of the two energetic photons are more than 1.5 GeV/c. The systematic uncertainty due to the reconstruction of two energetic photons is determined to be 0.25% per photon as described in Ref. [29].

(5) is replaced by 1, so that one can obtain the expected angular distribution W 0 = 1 + cos 2 \u03b8 1 from Eq. (23) if the parameters x = 0, y = 0 and f 2/0 = 0, as expected. Therefore, we fit the angular distribution of \u03c7 c0 with the Eq. (23) using the same method as in \u03c7 c2 decays; non-zero x, y and f 2/0 values will indicate the inconsistency between data and MC simulation. The systematic error is taken as the shift from 0 plus its error. The fitted results are x = \u22120.11 \u00b1 0.09, y = 0.13 \u00b1 0.07 and f 2/0 = 0.00 \u00b1 0.02. The correlation coefficient between x and y is -0.27, while it is 0.0 between x (y) and f 2/0 . Thus we take 0.02 as the systematic error for the measurement of f 0/2 in the fit to \u03c7 c2 events. Studies with MC simulated data samples demonstrate that a systematic error in modeling the \u03b8 1 , \u03b8 2 , and \u03c6 2 efficiency produces a shift of approximately the same size for f 2/0 in \u03c7 c0 sample and f 0/2 in \u03c7 c2 sample, when the latter sample is generated with x = 1.55, y = 2.10 and f 0/2 = 0. Therefore, we assume the observed shift from f 2/0 for the true \u03c7 c0 data is an estimate of the systematic error on the measured values of f 0/2 for the two-photon decay of \u03c7 c2 . a The results from the literature have been reevaluated by using the branching fractions and total widths from the PDG global fit.",

The helicity-zero component in the \u03c7 c2 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 decay is highly suppressed. This measurement is consistent with the calculations based on a relativistic potential model [5], in which the ratio is predicted to be less than 0.5%.",
