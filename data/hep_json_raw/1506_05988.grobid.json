Five final states, targeting the decays H \u2192 W W * , \u03c4 \u03c4 , and Z Z * , are examined for the presence of the Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson: two same-charge light leptons (e or \u03bc) without a hadronically decaying \u03c4 lepton; three light leptons; two same-charge light leptons with a hadronically decaying \u03c4 lepton; four light leptons; and one light lepton and two hadronically decaying \u03c4 leptons. No significant excess of events is observed above the background expectation. The best fit for the tt H production cross section, assuming a Higgs boson mass of 125 GeV, is 2.1 +1.4 \u22121.2 times the SM expectation, and the observed (expected) upper limit at the 95% confidence level is 4.7 (2.4) times the SM rate. The p-value for compatibility with the background-only hypothesis is 1.8\u03c3 ; the expectation in the presence of a Standard Model signal is 0.9\u03c3 .",

Having both the tree-and loop-level measurements would allow disambiguation of new physics effects that could affect the two differently, such as dimension-six operators contributing to the gg H vertex. This letter describes a search for the SM Higgs boson in the tt H production mode in multilepton final states. The five final states considered are: two same-charge-sign light leptons (e or \u03bc) with no additional hadronically decaying \u03c4 lepton; three light leptons; two same-sign light leptons with one hadronically decaying \u03c4 lepton; four light leptons; and one light lepton with two hadronically decaying \u03c4 candidates. These channels are sensitive to the Higgs decays H \u2192 W W * , \u03c4 \u03c4 , and Z Z * produced in association E-mail address: atlas.publications@cern.ch. with a top quark pair decaying to one or two leptons.

The production of t Hqb and t H W is taken into account. In the Standard Model these rates are very small compared to tt H production. These processes are simulated with the same parameters as used by the ATLAS tt H, H \u2192 \u03b3 \u03b3 search [20]. The cross sections for both are computed using the MG5_aMC@NLO generator [29] at NLO in QCD. For t Hqb, the renormalization and factorization scales are set to 75 GeV and the process is computed in the four-flavour scheme, yielding \u03c3 (t Hqb) = 17.2 +0.8 \u22121.4 (scale) +1.2 \u22120.9 (PDF) fb. For t H W , dynamic factorization and renormalization scales are used, and the process is computed in the five-flavour scheme; the result is \u03c3 (t H W ) = 4.7 +0.4 \u22120.3 (scale) +0.8 \u22120.6 (PDF) fb. The interference of t H W production with tt H, which appears at NLO for t H W in diagrams with an additional b-quark in the final state, is not considered.",

They are required to have |\u03b7 cluster | < 2.47. Candidates in the transition region 1.37 < |\u03b7 cluster | < 1.52 between sections of the electromagnetic calorimeter are excluded. A multivariate discriminant based on shower shape and track information is used to distinguish electrons from hadronic showers [80,81]. Only electron candidates with transverse energy E T greater than 10 GeV are considered. To reduce the background from non-prompt electrons, i.e. from decays of hadrons (including heavy flavour) produced in jets, electron candidates are required to be isolated. Two isolation variables, based on calorimetric and tracking variables, are computed. The first (E cone T ) is based on the sum of transverse energies of calorimeter cells within a cone of radius R \u2261 ( \u03c6) 2 + ( \u03b7) 2 = 0.2 around the electron candidate direction. This energy sum excludes cells associated with the electron and is corrected for leakage from the electromagnetic shower and ambient energy in the event. The second (p cone T ) is defined based on tracks with p T > 1 GeV within a cone of radius R = 0.2 around the electron candidate. Both isolation energies are separately required to be less than 0.05 \u00d7 E T . The longitudinal impact parameter of the electron track with respect to the selected event primary vertex, multiplied by the sine of the polar angle, |z 0 sin \u03b8|, is required to be less than 1 mm.

The distributions of the number of jets in the events passing signal region selections are shown in Fig. 2. The best-fit value of the signal strength \u03bc = \u03c3 tt H,obs /\u03c3 tt H,SM is determined using a maximum likelihood fit to the data yields of the categories listed in Table 3, which are treated as independent Poisson terms in the likelihood. The fit is based on the profile-likelihood approach where the systematic uncertainties are treated as nuisance parameters with prior uncertainties that can be further constrained by the fit [95] Systematic uncertainties are allowed to float in the fit as nuisance parameters and take on their best-fit values. The only constraints on nuisance parameter uncertainties found by the fit are for non-prompt lepton transfer factors and normalization region yields in the 2 0\u03c4 had categories and the fake \u03c4 had background yield in the 1 2\u03c4 had category. The former all have large statistical components and so the additional information from the signal regions is expected to constrain them. The latter has a very large initial uncertainty which the fit is able to constrain as \u03bc is required to be the same in all categories. The largest difference between preand post-fit nuisance parameter values is in the 1 2\u03c4 had fake estimate, which shifts by \u22121.0\u03c3 due to the deficit of observed relative to expected events. The next largest effect is a +0.4\u03c3 shift in the 2 0\u03c4 had non-prompt \u03bc transfer factor.",
