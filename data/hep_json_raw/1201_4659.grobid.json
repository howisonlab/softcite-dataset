Fully hadronic final states were selected based on the \"stransverse\" mass variable M T 2 and interpreted in various models of supersymmetry (SUSY). Two complementary analyses were performed targeting different areas of the SUSY phase space. All backgrounds were estimated using both simulation and data-driven methods. As no excess of events over the expected background was observed exclusion limits were derived.",

The results are based on a data sample of 1.1 fb \u22121 of integrated luminosity collected in 2011. We use the \"stransverse mass\" variable M T 2 [3] to select new physics candidates out of fully hadronic events. We divide our search into two channels: one targets high squark and gluino masses with a high M T 2 cut, the other heavy squarks and light gluinos with a medium M T 2 cut but including a b-tag and high jet multiplicities. In the following we describe the properties of M T 2 in sec. 2, our analyis strategy and event selection in sec. 3, and the background estimation in sec. 4. In sec. 5 we state the results of our search, and draw a conclusion in sec. 6.",

Thus SUSY with expected large MET will accumulate in the high M T 2 region. However, back-to-back systems or balanced events will populate the region with small M T 2 .

These 12021-p.2   fig. 3 for A 0 = 0, \u00b5 > 0 and tan \u03b2 = 10 combining the High and Low MT2 selections by taking the best expected limit in each point. Besides the exclusion in the mSUGRA/CMSSM plane the results are interpreted in a so-called Simplified Models topology. This is a simple signal model with exactly one decay mode which is only constrained by the kinematics and the masses of the participating particles. The Low M T 2 analysis is interpreted in a model where gluinos are pair produced and each gluino decays into two b-quarks and a neutralino, the LSP. The limits on the model cross sections and the signal efficiencies are shown in fig. 4.  ",

A data set containing 1.1 fb \u22121 of integrated luminosity in \u221a s = 7 TeV pp collisions recorded by the CMS detector during the 2011 LHC run was analyzed. Two complementary analyses were performed to probe a larger SUSY phase space. In both analyses the tail of the M T 2 is sensitive to a possible SUSY signal. As no evidence for a signal was found, we set upper limits on the cross section times branching ratio within our acceptance. Exclusions limits were established in the mSUGRA/CMSSM parameter space, as well as in a Simplified Model topology.",
