The integrated and differential cross sections are evaluated down to p T =0 in two rapidity ranges, |y| < 0.9 and 2.5 < y < 4, in the dielectron and dimuon decay channel respectively. The measurement at \u221a s=2.76 TeV, the same energy as Pb-Pb collisions, provides a crucial reference for the study of hot nuclear matter effects on J/\u03c8 production. The J/\u03c8 yield in pp collisions at \u221a s=7 TeV has also been studied as a function of the charged particle multiplicity and first results are presented.",

            "text": "Quarkonium production study in these interactions has a twofold interest. On one hand, this new energy regime might allow further insight in the understanding of the quarkonium production mechanisms. In fact, theoretical models have not been able, up to now, to consistently interpret, at RHIC and Tevatron energies, all aspects of quarkonium production, as the J/\u03c8 transverse momentum (p T ) distribution and polarization. On the other hand, pp collisions represent a reference to understand the quarkonium behaviour in the hot and dense state of QCD (or hadronic) matter formed in heavy ion collisions. In particular, pp interactions at \u221a s=2.76 TeV, turn out to be a crucial baseline, being collected at the same \u221a s N N of the Pb-Pb collisions.",

            "text": "The ALICE experiment consists of a central barrel (|\u03b7| < 0.9) and a forward muon spectrometer (\u22124 < \u03b7 < \u22122.5). Central barrel detectors are located inside a large solenoidal magnet and allow the tracking of particles down to p T of about 100 MeV/c. The barrel detectors, used in this analysis, are the Inner Tracking System (ITS), for the vertex identification and track reconstruction close to the interaction point, and the Time Projection Chamber (TPC) for tracking and electron identification. Muons with a momentum larger than 4 GeV/c are detected in the muon spectrometer. It consists of a front absorber, followed by a dipole magnet, coupled to a set of tracking and triggering chambers. An iron wall, placed upstream the trigger chambers, absorbs secondary hadrons escaping the front absorber. Finally, the forward VZERO detector, made of two scintillator arrays covering the range 2.8< \u03b7 < 5.1 and -3.7< \u03b7 <-1.7, is J/\u03c8 production in pp collisions at \u221a s=2.76 and 7 TeV with ALICE 2 used for triggering purposes. For more details on the apparatus, see [1]. Quarkonia are measured in the dielectron decay channel, at midrapidity, and in the dimuon one, at forward rapidity. The transverse momentum acceptance goes down to p T =0, in both y regions, providing, at midrapidity, a unique coverage at LHC. In this proceeding, we present results on the inclusive J/\u03c8 production, while the analysis of the 2011 higher statistics sample will also allow us to measure the prompt J/\u03c8 fraction at midrapidity. Final results based on a fraction of the 2010 pp data at \u221a s=7 TeV and preliminary results from the pp data collected in a three-day long run in 2011 at \u221a s=2.76 TeV are discussed. The data sample corresponds to events collected with the minimum bias trigger, defined as the logical OR between the requirement of at least one hit in the ITS pixel layers (SPD), and a signal in one of the two VZERO detectors. For the muon analysis, the minimum bias trigger is required to be in coincidence with a signal in the muon trigger chambers. For the J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 analysis, events are selected asking for at least one interaction vertex reconstructed by the SPD and applying quality cuts on the muon tracks. Furthermore, to reject hadrons produced in the front absorber, at least one of the two muons, forming the dimuon, should also give a signal in the trigger chambers. Requiring both muons to satisfy the trigger condition does not significantly improve the purity of the J/\u03c8 sample, in spite of a significant loss (\u2248 20%) in statistics. A fit to the dimuon invariant mass spectrum, in the region 1.5 < m \u00b5\u00b5 < 5 GeV/c 2 allows to extract the J/\u03c8 yield. The background is described by a double exponential function, while the signals, J/\u03c8 and \u03c8(2S), are fitted with Crystal Ball functions [2]. At \u221a s=7 TeV, the number of J/\u03c8 corresponding to an integrated luminosity (L int ) of 15.6 nb \u22121 , is 1924 \u00b1 77. For the J/\u03c8 \u2192 e + e \u2212 analysis, electrons are identified through the specific energy loss in the TPC, applying a \u00b13\u03c3 inclusion cut and a \u00b13.5 (\u00b13)\u03c3 exclusion cut for pions (protons). The J/\u03c8 yield is evaluated from a bin counting technique, after subtracting the like-sign background to the invariant mass spectrum. The total number of J/\u03c8, corresponding to L int = 3.9 nb \u22121 , is N J/\u03c8 = 249 \u00b1 27. A Monte Carlo simulation, based on realistic J/\u03c8 p T and y distributions, is used to estimate the acceptance of the apparatus and the reconstruction and trigger efficiencies (A \u00d7 \u01eb). At \u221a s=7 TeV, for the J/\u03c8 \u2192 e + e \u2212 analysis A \u00d7 \u01eb is 10%, while for the J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 analysis it is 33%. The inclusive J/\u03c8 production cross section is obtained dividing the number of J/\u03c8 by A \u00d7 \u01eb and by the integrated luminosity. Results at \u221a s=7 TeV are: \u03c3 J/\u03c8 (2.5 < y < 4)=6.31\u00b10.25 (stat.)\u00b10.80(syst.) +0.95 \u22121.96 (pol.)\u00b5 and \u03c3 J/\u03c8 (|y| <0.9)=10.7\u00b11.2(stat.)\u00b11.7(syst.) +1.6 \u22122.3 (pol.)\u00b5b. Systematic uncertainties include the errors on the signal extraction, on the trigger and reconstruction efficiencies, on the p T and y input distributions used in the A \u00d7 \u01eb evaluation, and on the luminosity determination. The influence of the unknown degree of J/\u03c8 polarization on the acceptance evaluation is quoted separately. Following the same approach adopted for the evalution of the integrated cross section, also the differential distributions are studied. The ALICE muon measurement and the LHCb result, covering the same y range, are in good agreement, while the ALICE electron result complements the high p T ATLAS and CMS distributions, reaching p T =0. More details on the analysis can be found in [3].",

            "text": "These results, obtained at the same center-of-mass energy of the Pb-Pb collisions, are mandatory for the evaluation of the Pb-Pb nuclear modification factor R AA , to correctly quantify the hot nuclear matter effects on the J/\u03c8 yield [4]. The larger J/\u03c8 statistics collected in the dimuon channel allows the evaluation of the differential p T and y cross sections. In Fig. 1 the distributions are compared to those obtained at \u221a s=7 TeV. At both energies, NRQCD NLO calculations [5], available for p T > 3 GeV/c, provide a good description of the p T distributions. The d\u03c3 J/\u03c8 /dy measured at midrapidity increases linearly as a function of \u221a s, following the trend defined by RHIC and Tevatron results at lower energies. Furthermore, the integrated cross section at both energies are in reasonable agreement with expectations based on calculations from FONLL and leading order color evaporation model [6]. Fitting the ALICE p T differential distributions with the function A \u00d7 p T /(1 + (p T /p 0 ) 2 ) n , the J/\u03c8 p T and p 2 T have been extracted. A logarithmic increase of p 2 T with \u221a s holds from low energy up to the LHC domain, as shown in Fig. 2 (left), and a similar trend is observed also for p T . The J/\u03c8 production yield at \u221a s=7 TeV has also been studied as a function of the charged particle pseudo-rapidity density dN ch /d\u03b7, measured in the ITS (|\u03b7| <1.6), both in the dielectron and in the dimuon channel. The multiplicity corresponding to five times the average value is of about 30, and it is similar to the one measured in semi-peripheral Cu-Cu interactions at \u221a s N N =200 GeV [7]. Therefore, high multiplicity pp collisions might present features observed, up to now, only in nucleus-nucleus interactions at lower energy [8]. Following an approach similar to the one described for the cross section evaluation, the J/\u03c8 yield is extracted in intervals of dN ch /d\u03b7. The relative yield Y R J/\u03c8 , i.e. the J/\u03c8 yield in each bin divided by the inclusive yield in minimum bias events, is shown in Fig. 2 (right), as a function of the relative charged particle density (dN R ch /d\u03b7 = dN ch /d\u03b7| \u03b7=0 / dN ch /d\u03b7| \u03b7=0 ). Preliminary results in both the dielectron and dimuon channel show a similar linear increase as a function of multiplicity. The ALICE experiment has measured the inclusive J/\u03c8 production at \u221a s=2.76 TeV and 7 TeV in two rapidity ranges, 2.5 < y < 4 and |y| < 0.9. At both central and forward rapidities the J/\u03c8 production is measured down to p T =0, providing a unique acceptance coverage at LHC. The collected pp data allow also a first analysis of J/\u03c8 production as a function of particle multiplicity, and a linear increase of the production yield is observed. The analysis of the full statistics collected in 2010, together with the new data from the on-going run, will provide further insights on the J/\u03c8 production, addressing other topics, such as the study of the J/\u03c8 polarization and the identification, through the study of the pseudo-proper decay time distributions, of the J/\u03c8 coming from B decay.",
