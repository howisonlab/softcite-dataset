The search is performed using a data set of pp collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 as recorded by the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC in the year 2016. The analysis is optimised for final states arising from the T decay modes to a top quark and a Higgs or Z boson (T \u2192 Ht, Zt). The event selection makes use of resolved and merged top quark decay products, as well as decays of boosted Higgs bosons and Z and W bosons using jet substructure techniques. No significant deviation from the standard model background expectation is observed. Exclusion limits on the product of the cross section and branching fraction for Z \u2192 tT, T \u2192 Ht, Zt, Wb are presented for various combinations of the Z resonance mass and the vector-like T quark mass. These results represent the most stringent limits to date for the decay mode Z \u2192 tT \u2192 tHt. In a benchmark model with extra dimensions, invoking a heavy spin-1 resonance G * , masses of the G * between 1.5 and 2.3 TeV and between 2.0 and 2.4 TeV are excluded for T masses of 1.2 and 1.5 TeV, respectively.",

            "text": "Many extensions of the standard model (SM) predict the existence of heavy bosonic resonances, such as the composite spin-1 resonances found in the \u03c1 0 model [1], or the lightest Kaluza-Klein excitation of the gluon [2] in Randall-Sundrum models [3,4]. In models that invoke such states to address the hierarchy problem, these resonances are required to cancel top quark loop contributions to the radiative corrections that would otherwise drive the Higgs boson mass up to the Planck scale. As a consequence, these resonances typically feature an enhanced coupling to third-generation e-mail: cms-publication-committee-chair@cern.ch SM quarks, resulting in decays predominantly to SM top quarks. The ATLAS and CMS Collaborations have performed searches for such resonances in their proton-proton (pp) collision data sets at centre-of-mass energies \u221a s = 8 [5-7] and 13 TeV [8-10], leading to stringent exclusion limits on the product of the resonance cross section and branching fraction, and therefore also on the resonance masses when interpreted in the context of specific models. However, in some models describing physics beyond the standard model (BSM) the new heavy resonance state is accompanied by an additional fermionic sector realised as a non-chiral (or vectorlike) fourth generation of quarks. Vector-like quarks (VLQs) are fermions whose left-and right-handed components transform in the same way under the electroweak symmetry group. For this reason, direct mass terms for VLQs are not forbidden in the BSM Lagrangian. Furthermore, unlike sequential fourth-generation chiral quarks, the existence of VLQs is not yet excluded by recent Higgs boson measurements [11].",

In these models, decays of the heavy resonance into final states with VLQs are allowed. The analysis presented in this paper searches for evidence of the production of a heavy spin-1 resonance, denoted as Z , with decays to an SM top quark and a vector-like top quark partner T, Z \u2192 tT. This decay mode is dominant for the intermediate Z mass region in which the decay is kinematically allowed (M t + M T < M Z ) and the decay to two VLQ top quark partners (Z \u2192 TT) is kinematically forbidden (M Z < 2M T ). The VLQ T considered in this analysis has three decay channels: to a Higgs boson and a top quark (T \u2192 Ht), to a Z boson and a top quark (T \u2192 Zt), and to a W boson and a bottom quark (T \u2192 Wb). The leading-order Feynman diagram showing the production mode of the Z boson and its subsequent decay, including the decay of the VLQ, is shown in Fig. 1.",

The analysis was optimised for the decay mode T \u2192 Wb and made use of the all-hadronic final state, where both the top quark and W boson are highly Lorentzboosted, resulting in a three-jet event topology. No deviation from the SM expectation was observed and upper limits on the cross section were obtained, ranging from 0.13 to 10 pb depending on the masses of the Z and T. A search for the single production of a vector-like quark T decaying to a Z boson and a top quark in the dilepton + jets final state has also been performed, with an interpretation of the results in the context of a Z decaying into tT [18]. Upper limits on the cross section ranging from 0.06 to 0.13 pb were obtained, for the production of a Z with the subsequent decays to tT and T \u2192 Zt.

Contained within the solenoid volume are a silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL), and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter (HCAL), each composed of a barrel and two endcap sections. Muons are detected in gasionization chambers embedded in the steel flux-return yoke outside the solenoid. Extensive forward calorimetry complements the pseudorapidity (\u03b7) coverage provided by the barrel and endcap detectors. Events of interest are selected using a two-tiered trigger system [29]. The first level, composed of custom hardware processors, uses information from the calorimeters and muon detectors to select events at a rate of around 100 kHz within a time interval of less than 4 \u00b5s. The second level, known as the high-level trigger, consists of a farm of processors running a version of the full event reconstruction software optimised for fast processing, and reduces the event rate to around 1 kHz before data storage. A more detailed description of the CMS detector, together with a definition of the coordinate system used and the relevant kinematic variables, can be found in Ref. [30].",

Since the analysis targets both resolved and merged top quark decays, jets are clustered with two values of the distance parameter R; R = 0.4 (AK4 jets) for the reconstruction of resolved top quark decay products, and R = 0.8 (AK8 jets) for the reconstruction of merged W, Z, and Higgs boson decay products as well as merged top quark decays. In the jet clustering procedure, charged PF candidates associated with non-primary vertices are excluded. The jet momentum is determined as the vectorial sum of all particle momenta in the jet, and is found from simulation to be within 5-10% of the true momentum over the whole p T spectrum and detector acceptance. A correction based on the area of the jet, projected on the front face of the calorimeter, is used to correct for the extra energy clustered in jets due to additional inelastic proton-proton interactions within the same or adjacent bunch crossings (pileup) [33]. Jet energy corrections are derived from simulation in order to bring the measured response of jets to that of particle level jets on average. Dijet, multijet, photon + jet, and leptonically-decaying Z + jet events are used to perform in situ measurements of the momentum balance to derive corrections for residual differences in jet energy scale in data and simulation [37]. Additional selection criteria are applied to each event to remove spurious jet-like features originating from isolated noise patterns in certain HCAL regions [38]. The clustered jets also contain leptons. To avoid double counting of the lepton momentum in an event, the lepton used for the reconstruction of the W boson from the leptonic top quark decay is removed from an AK4 jet if the lepton overlaps with the jet within the jet's radius parameter, \u0394R( , j) < 0.4, where 2 , and \u0394\u03b7( , j) and \u0394\u03c6( , j) are the separations in pseudorapidity and azimuthal angle, respectively, between the lepton and jet. The momentum of the lepton is subtracted from that of the jet before jet energy corrections are applied. Larger radius AK8 jets that overlap with the lepton within \u0394R( , j) < 0.8 are not considered in this analysis. Jets that are produced by the decay of b quarks can be identified using the combined secondary vertex discriminator [39]. An AK4 jet is denoted as being b tagged if it fulfils the medium working point of the discriminator, which has an efficiency of 63% for correctly identifying a b quark jet, with a 1% probability of misidentifying a light-flavour jet as b tagged (a mistag).",

Each tagger requires the jet mass to be within a certain range, along with additional criteria on substructure variables such as Nsubjettiness [40] or subjet b tagging [39]. The jet mass is computed after applying a modified mass-drop algorithm [41,42], known as the soft drop algorithm [43], which eliminates soft, large-angle radiation resulting from SM quantum chromodynamics (QCD) processes. This improves the jet mass resolution for the reconstructed boson and top quark. It also reduces the mass of jets initiated by single quarks or gluons, thereby improving discrimination between jets from true boson or top quark decays, and those from background QCD multijet events. Furthermore, it helps mitigate the effect of pileup [28]. The N-subjettiness variable \u03c4 N quantifies the compatibility of the jet clustering with the hypothesis that exactly N subjets are present, with small values of \u03c4 N indicating greater compatibility. The N-subjettiness ratios \u03c4 21 = \u03c4 2 /\u03c4 1 and \u03c4 32 = \u03c4 3 /\u03c4 2 are calculated prior to the application of the soft drop algorithm, and are used to reject background jets arising from the hadronization of single quarks or gluons. Jets from hadronic Z/W boson decays in signal events are characterized by smaller values of \u03c4 21 in comparison to jets from QCD multijet background processes, and similarly jets from merged hadronic top quark decays have smaller values of \u03c4 32 than background jets. For each AK8 jet, two subjets are obtained from the soft drop algorithm. An AK8 jet can have up to two subjet b tags depending on how many subjets fulfil the loose working point of the b tagging discriminator. In contrast to the medium working point applied to AK4 jets, the loose working point has a larger b tagging efficiency of 83%, at the expense of a larger mistag probability of 9%.",

Events targeting the decay of a top quark to a final state including a muon are selected with a high-level single-muon trigger that requires the presence of at least one muon candidate with p T > 50 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.4. For events targeting a final state with an electron, the high-level trigger requires the presence of at least one electron candidate with p T > 115 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.5, or at least one photon with p T > 175 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.5. The latter requirement ensures events containing electrons with a high p T are efficiently selected, as the requirements on ECAL shower shapes are less stringent for photons than for electrons. Given the highly boosted topology of the final-state objects, no isolation requirements are applied to the lepton candidates at the trigger level. The electron trigger threshold is significantly larger than the muon trigger threshold, since the non-isolated electron trigger selects a large number of hadrons incorrectly identified as electrons.

For the Z and T mass parameter space considered in this analysis the total Z decay width in the two considered theoretical models is always less than 20% of its mass. Since the experimental resolution is approximately 15%, the samples with the Z width set to 1% are dominated by the experimental resolution, and are thus used in the interpretation of the results. The samples generated with the width of 30% are used as cross-checks and help to confirm that the conclusions do not change for scenarios with Z widths somewhat larger than the experimental resolution for high masses of the Z . Furthermore, it was checked that scenarios with T widths of up to 30%, with a Z width equal to or larger than that of the T, do not significantly affect the resolution of the Z mass, and therefore the experimental limits obtained with the T width set to 1% are also valid for larger T width scenarios. The G * model considers only left-handed T quarks. The \u03c1 0 model also allows for a right-handed \u03c1 R coupling to T quarks. For the T \u2192 Ht decay mode the kinematic distributions in the G * model and \u03c1 0 model are the same. While for the T \u2192 Zt and T \u2192 Wb decay modes the Z/W boson p T spectra are similar for the left-handed \u03c1 L and the G * , the ratio of the distributions for left-and right-handed scenarios in the \u03c1 0 model deviates from unity by up to 30%. In this analysis only the decays of the left-handed \u03c1 L are considered.",

The reconstruction of a fully resolved tt system is performed by defining top quark candidates, built from the four-momenta of the reconstructed objects. One candidate is constructed for the hadronic decay of the (anti)top quark (denoted the hadronic top quark candidate), and one for the leptonic decay of the (anti)top quark (denoted the leptonic top quark candidate). Objects that are used in the reconstruction are the p miss T , leptons, AK4 jets, and a t-tagged AK8 jet, if present. Only AK4 jets with p T > 30 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.4 are considered. The b tag information of the AK4 jets is not used in the reconstruction of the tt system, since it was found that applying it did not improve the assignment of jets to the top quark candidates. To ensure that there is no overlap between the two jet collections, AK4 jets that overlap with the Z/W-or H-tagged jet within \u0394R(tagged AK8 jet, AK4 jet) < 1.2 are removed from the event. If an event has a t-tagged jet, AK4 jets with \u0394R(t-tagged AK8 jet, AK4 jet) < 1.2 are removed from the analysis.

The mistag rate is defined as the number of AK8 jets after the tagger is applied, divided by the number of AK8 jets before the tagger is applied. The data are selected with a trigger requiring the scalar p T sum of the jets in the event, defined as H T , to be H T > 900 GeV. The selected data events are then required to have H T > 1000 GeV to ensure that events are selected in a region of phase space where the trigger is fully efficient. The AK8 jets must have |\u03b7| < 2.5, p T > 200 GeV, and M SD AK8 > 30 GeV. The uncertainties in the mistag rate scale factors receive contributions from statistical uncertainties, and from effects associated with differences in the quark and gluon compositions and in the kinematic distributions between the QCD multijet and Z/W + jets samples. The mistag rate for the Z/W tagger is measured both in data and in simulation, resulting in a scale factor of 1.05 \u00b1 0.08 that is applied to simulation in the signal regions. The scale factor is only applied to jets that are Z/W tagged and are not matched to a Z/W boson at generator level, where a jet is considered matched if both quarks of the hadronic boson decay are within \u0394R(q, tagged AK8 jet) < 0.8. The mistag rate scale factors for the H 2b and H 1b taggers are 1.15 \u00b1 0.18 and 1.22 \u00b1 0.05, respectively, and are applied to all MC samples (except tt) that do not contain real Higgs bosons. Since the fraction of jets initiated by a b quark is significantly higher in the tt background than in the W+jets and QCD multijet backgrounds, a dedicated scale factor is calculated for the mistag rate of the H 2b and H 1b taggers in a sample of tt events with backto-back topology in the +jets final state. These mistag rate scale factors are measured to be 1.01 \u00b1 0.18 and 0.99 \u00b1 0.03 for the H 2b and H 1b taggers, respectively. The mistag rate scale factor for the t tagger is measured to be 0.95 \u00b1 0.02.

The efficiency of the Z/W tagger is measured in a ttenriched region with a back-to-back topology. One of the top quarks is required to decay leptonically into a b quark and a W boson, with the W boson decaying into a lepton and a neutrino, whilst the other top quark decays hadronically, result-  ing in a b quark reconstructed as an AK4 jet and a W boson reconstructed as an AK8 jet. This AK8 jet is used to measure the efficiency of the Z/W tagger. The sample is selected following the same procedure as in Sect. 5.1, additionally requiring at least two AK4 jets, where each jet must have p T > 30 GeV, |\u03b7| < 2.4, must pass the medium working point of the b tagging discriminator, and not overlap with the AK8 jet. It is required that the angular separation \u0394R between the leptonic top quark and the hadronic top quark is greater than \u03c0/2 in order to reconstruct W bosons well-separated from nearby b quark jets. The Z/W tagger efficiency scale factor is then estimated with a procedure similar to that used for the t tagger, and is found to be 0.91 \u00b1 0.08 for events in the signal region. The systematic uncertainty for the dependence of the scale factor on the choice of the fit model used to extract the boosted W contribution from the combinatorial tt background is estimated to be 1%. A direct measurement of the tagger efficiency scale factor using data is only possible for jet p T 200 GeV. For larger jet p T , the difference between tt samples simulated with two different shower and hadronization models (pythia 8 and herwig++ 2.7.1 [65]) contributes an additional uncertainty to the p T dependence of the scale factor parameterised as 4.1%\u00d7ln( p T /200 GeV).",

The uncertainty related to the choice of \u03bc F and \u03bc R scales is evaluated following the proposal in Refs. [66,67] by varying the default choice of scales by the following six combinations of factors, (\u03bc F , \u03bc R ) \u00d7 (1/2, 1/2), (1/2, 1), (1, 1/2), (2, 2), (2, 1), and (1,2). The maximum and minimum of the six variations are computed for each bin of the M rec Z distribu-tion, producing an uncertainty \"envelope\" that affects both normalization and shape. For samples generated at LO and NLO, uncertainties based on the NNPDF 3.0 PDF sets [61] and PDF4LHC15 (NLO 100) [68,69], respectively, have been evaluated using the PDF4LHC procedure [68], where the root-mean-square of 100 pseudo-experiments provided by the PDF sets represent the uncertainty envelope. For the W+jets, Z+jets, tt, and single top quark background processes, the full uncertainty in normalization and shape due to the variations in cross section is evaluated. For signal samples, only the uncertainty in normalization and shape due to the variations in event selection and reconstruction efficiency is taken into account, and overall uncertainties in the inclusive cross section due to PDF variations are only displayed as error bands on benchmark theory model predictions.",

The binning in the figures is chosen such that the statistical uncertainty of the background MC simulation in each bin does not exceed 30%, leading to some categories represented by a single bin only. As a consequence of the higher electron trigger threshold, the categories \"Z/W with top tag\" and \"H 2b with no top tag\" contain significantly fewer events than the corresponding categories in the muon channel, and are thus only represented by a single bin as well.",

The systematic uncertainties are taken into account as nuisance parameters in the likelihood. For each systematic uncertainty that affects the shape of the reconstructed Z mass, an interpolation between the nominal template and the shifted template with a Gaussian prior is performed. Systematic uncertainties that affect only the normalization are taken into account as nuisance parameters with log-normal priors. The likelihood is maximized with respect to these parameters.

            "text": "No significant excess of events in the data over the expectation from SM backgrounds was found for the ranges of Z and T masses considered. A Bayesian calculation with priors known to yield good frequentist properties [64,71,72] is used to derive 95% CL upper limits on the product of the cross section and branching fraction, \u03c3 (pp \u2192 Z \u2192 tT)B(T \u2192 Ht, Zt, Wb), for a heavy resonance Z decaying into a top quark and a vector-like quark T. The calculation is implemented in the Theta software package [73]. The median of the distribution of the upper limits at 95% CL in the pseudoexperiments and the central 68% (95%) interval define the expected upper limit and the 1 (2) standard deviation band, respectively. Figure 7 shows observed limits as a function of Z mass, T mass, and T decay mode. The limits are obtained using only decays to the indicated decay mode. Limits are shown for combinations of Z and T masses where the decay Z \u2192 tT is kinematically allowed and the decay Z \u2192 TT is kinematically forbidden. Figure 8 shows limits on the product of the cross sections and branching fractions B = B(T \u2192 Wb) + B(T \u2192 Ht)+B(T \u2192 Zt), for fixed ratios of the individual branching fractions. The upper row in Fig. 8 shows the limit as a function of the Z mass for a fixed T mass of 1.2 TeV. The upper left plot compares the limit with a prediction from the G * model, showing that G * masses between 1.5 and 2.3 TeV are excluded by this search, for a T mass of 1.2 TeV. The decrease in the predicted G * cross section at a mass of approximately 2 TeV is due to the custodian VLQ T 5/3 with a mass of 1 TeV, such that the G * \u2192 T 5/3 T 5/3 decay mode then becomes kinematically viable. At a mass of 2.4 TeV there is another decrease in the predicted cross section due to the availability of the G * \u2192 T T decay. This has the effect of drastically increasing the width of the G * , and also lowering the branching ratio (and hence predicted cross section) for the decay mode G * \u2192 tT. In the upper right plot of Fig. 8, the limit is compared with a prediction for the left-handed \u03c1 L from the \u03c1 0 model, showing that this search is not sensitive to this model. The lower row of plots in Fig. 8 shows the observed and expected limits in the context of the G * model for two other T masses. For a T mass of 1.5 TeV (lower left), G * masses between 2.0 and 2.4 TeV are excluded by this search, whilst for a T mass of 2.1 TeV (lower right) this analysis is not able to exclude the model scenario.",

The data used in this search were recorded with the CMS detector at the LHC at \u221a s = 13 TeV and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 . The analysis is primarily optimised to study the decay modes of the vectorlike quark to a Higgs boson and a top quark (T \u2192 Ht), and to a Z boson and a top quark (T \u2192 Zt), although the decay to a W boson and a bottom quark (T \u2192 Wb) is also considered. This is the first direct search for the decay Z \u2192 tT \u2192 tHt. No significant excess of events over the expectation from standard model backgrounds is found. Limits on the production cross section are presented for a narrow Z resonance in the mass range from 1.5 to 4.0 TeV and a narrow T resonance in the mass range from 0.7 to 3.0 TeV. Interpretation of these limits within the context of the G * benchmark model results in the exclusion of G * resonance masses in the range from 1.5 to 2.3 TeV and from 2.0 to 2.4 TeV, for a T mass of 1.2 and 1.5 TeV, respectively. The presented limits are the most stringent to date for the decay mode Z \u2192 tT \u2192 tHt. accelerator departments for the excellent performance of the LHC and thank the technical and administrative staffs at CERN and at other CMS institutes for their contributions to the success of the CMS effort.
