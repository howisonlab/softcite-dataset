The objective of the present paper is to add these new results to earlier data onpp \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + and do a combined partial wave analysis. Data on d\u03c3/d\u2126 were reported by Eisenhandler et al. [2] and on polarisation P by Carter et al. [3] from 990 to 2430 MeV/c (masses up to 2580 MeV). Further data on both d\u03c3/d\u2126 and P from 360 to 1550 MeV/c were reported by Hasan et al. [4]. The polarisation data play a vital role in the analysis, since they separate cleanly states with L = J \u00b11, e.g. 3 P 2 and 3 F 2 . These data help greatly in consolidating the analyses of \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 , \u03b7\u03b7 and \u03b7\u03b7 \u2032 data and help identify resonances. The data of Hasan et al. are particularly valuable, since they cover the important mass range down to 1910 MeV.",

There are a number of reasons for this approach in terms of resonances. Firstly, we find that the well known f 4 (2050) makes a large and unavoidable contribution. It fits to a mass and width slightly lower than averages quoted by the Particle Data Group (PDG) [13]. Because we need to make use of its fitted mass, we shall hereafter refer to it as f 4 (2020). Once this resonance is introduced, it defines phases over a considerable mass range. Relative phases with other partial waves are accurately determined and it becomes impossible to avoid introducing further resonances into all other partial waves. This is not surprising, since resonances are predicted in this mass range by extrapolation from experience at lower masses. A second related point concerns the polarisation. It lies close to +1 over much of the angular range at many momenta and inevitably requires large imaginary parts in many partial wave amplitudes. The quantity P d\u03c3/d\u2126 is proportional to the imaginary part of the interference between partial waves. Differential cross sections measure the real parts of the same interferences. In order to achieve consistency between the principle of analyticity and these real and imaginary parts of interferences, we find resonance behaviour in all partial waves unavoidable. This is what was found in all earlier analyses except that of Kloet and Myrher [11], which focussed on the narrow mass range below a momentum of 1 GeV/c.",

Explicit formulae are given by Chung [14]. They guarantee the correct threshold behaviour in thepp channel. The G i are real coupling constants and \u03c6 i are phases for each resonance, arising from final state interactions. We now comment in general terms on this approach. Firstly, resonances overlap and interact to some degree, e.g. via common decay channels. In principle, a K-matrix approach is desirable, in order to investigate such interactions. In reality, this is impracticable at present, because of the large number of open channels, and almost complete lack of information about many of them. A practical point is that the speed of convergence of the fitting procedure is helped greatly by using as basis states the eigenstates of the scattering amplitudes; these are T-matrix poles. We therefore view the resonances fitted to the data as a parametrisation from which further analysis can unfold the physics content. A first step is to find how many resonances are required and what their properties are.",

In each partial wave, they lead to left-hand singularities which are very distant; the left-hand cut opens below s \u2243 1 GeV 2 . For J \u2264 3, there are further resonances lying between the mass range discussed here and the left-hand cuts. Any t-channel amplitude will acquire the phase dictated by s-channel resonances in each partial wave, via rescattering within the present mass range. The effect of any t-channel exchange is therefore to introduce some slow s-dependence into the resonance width. A classic example of this is the effect of the nucleon pole on the shape of the \u2206(1232) resonance, first treated by the theory of Chew and Low [15]. In the present mass range, fitting an s-dependent width to each resonance is an impractical luxury, because there are too many unknowns. For example, form factors and the opening of new channels will distort the shape of each resonance. For simplicity, we adopt constant widths.",

Even if K-matrix poles have the same phases, T-matrix poles can have different phases; the difference depends on the separation of poles, resonances widths and the mixing through decay channels. In view of this experience, we feel it unwise to demand strictly the same phases \u03c6 i in all channels. For most resonances, we have allowed \u03c6 i to optimise freely for each decay channel with differences limited to the range -15 to +15 \u2022 .

The fourth column of the table shows changes in \u03c7 2 when each resonance is removed from the fit and all other parameters are re-optimised; this measures the significance of each contribution in fitting the data. Most of these changes are enormous and leave no possible doubt about the presence of these resonances. Our impression, from the consistency between alternative fits with differing ingredients, is that any resonance contributing a change in \u03c7 2 > 100 is definitely present. However, below \u2206\u03c7 2 = 300, the mass and particularly the width are hard to establish with confidence.

Recent VES data on \u03c9\u03c9 give an improved mass determination of 1937 \u00b1 12 MeV and width \u0393 = 150 \u00b1 17 MeV [23].

However, it is at the bottom end of the range of data we analyse, and we observe some tendency for its mass to drift downwards. We view the determination of the mass by VES and GAMS as more secure, but our larger width appears reliable. If this resonance is dropped from the fit, \u03c7 2 increases by a definitive amount, namely 2290.

Adding this resonance to the fit, \u03c7 2 improves by 370, which we regard as significant. However, because it lies towards the bottom end of the available data for \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 and \u03b7\u03b7 and because of interference with f 0 (2105), its mass and width have sizeable errors, M = 2005 \u00b1 30 MeV, \u0393 = 305 \u00b1 50 MeV. is illustrated by the full line on Fig. 10(a).

From a fit with a Flatt\u00e9 form, the K-matrix mass is determined to be 1598 \u00b1 11(stat) \u00b1 9(syst) MeV. The f 2 (2020) and f 2 (2300) are readily placed on a parallel trajectory, shown by the dashed line of Fig. 10(a). The proximity of the f 2 (2020) to f 4 (2020) then suggests strongly that it is the qq 3 F 2 n = 1 state and the f 2 (2300) is its radial excitation. The states on the full line of Fig. 10(a) are naturally interpreted as qq 3 P 2 states. We interpret the shift in mass between the two lines as originating from the centrifugal barrier in the qq system. This provides an effective repulsion at small radii which shifts the resonance mass up more for L = 3 ( 3 F 2 ) than L = 1 3 P 2 .",

For 3 + , they are compatible with a trajectory of the same slope as other J P on Fig. 10, and with 3 F 3 states approximately degenerate with 3 F 4 and 3 F 2 . The assignment of 0 + resonances is presently controversial, so we do not show a trajectory for 0 + . Fig. 11 shows Regge trajectories. The leading trajectory made up of \u03c1(770), f 2 (1270), \u03c1 3 (1690), f 4 (2020), \u03c1 5 (2295) and f 6 (2485) is well known. These resonances lie close to a straight line versus s of slope 1.18 GeV 2 per unit of spin. One can just discern a possible slight difference (\u223c 0.1 GeV 2 ) between the trio 1 \u2212 , 3 \u2212 and 5 \u2212 and the even spin states. The slope is significantly greater than that of the lines on Fig. 10. Proof of this is the mass difference between f 4 (2020) and its grand-daughter f 2 (1910), likewise between \u03c1 5 (2295) and \u03c1 3 (2210) and the very clearly determined difference between f 4 (2020) and \u03c1 3 (1960). The centrifugal barrier in theqq system provides an explanation why high J states move up in mass. The intercept at zero mass with the vertical axis is at -0.67, slightly lower than the accepted value of -0.55 deduced from \u03c0N scattering data [34]; however, the systematic shift between even and odd spins on this trajectory allows the possibility of moving the intercept up by 0.1. Fig. 11 also shows further parallel Regge trajectories. It is interesting that \u03c1(1700) and \u03c1(1450) depart significantly from straight-line trajectories through states of higher spin. Donnachie and Clegg [35] have argued that decay modes of \u03c1(1450) require it to be a hybrid or mixed with a hybrid.",

Nonetheless, we feel it is worth summarising the fitted values of flavour mixing angles \u03a6 for 2 + and 4 + states. These are shown in Table 3. Errors on individual flavour mixing angles are typically \u00b15 \u2022 . However differences in \u03a6 between different resonances are strongly correlated. These differences are what allow an acceptable fit to the data via small deviations from SU(3). Nonetheless some flavour mixing is inevitable. If they are all set to zero, there is an unacceptable increase of 2646 in \u03c7 2 . Table 3 also includes fitted values of corresponding ratios r of amplitudes for spins 1, 3,4 and 5. Errors are typically \u00b115%. One discerns a trend from positive values for low masses to negative values at high masses. As the mass rises, the momentum in thepp channel increases and the first zero of j L (kr) describing thepp channel moves to smaller radius. As it moves inside the radius where the resonance wave function peaks, one expects a change of sign of the ratios of amplitudes r between L = J \u00b1 1, in qualitative agreement with the observations.

There is similar evidence from two other sources. Firstly, a broad 2 + contribution to the 4\u03c0 channel is observed in central production data at small p T [30]. Its mass is 1920 \u00b1 20 MeV with a width of 450 \u00b1 60 MeV. Secondly, there are data from BES on J/\u03a8 \u2192 \u03b34\u03c0 [41] and J/\u03a8 \u2192 \u03b3K * K * [42], which both require a broad 2 + signal peaking at about 2000 MeV.

The flavour mixing angle we observe then required some mixing with a nearby ss state; for ideal mixing, ss states are members of SU(3) singlets, so such mixing is plausible.

Their integrated cross sections are therefore compared inFig. 5 with the fit only over this angular range. The \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + data are available over the full angular range and are integrated over this range. Panels on Figs. 1-3 labelled H refer to Hasan et al; those labelled E refer to Eisenhandler et al. or the same experiment of Carter et al. On Fig. 1, the angular distributions are mostly fitted well. There are small discrepancies near cos \u03b8 = -1 for momenta of 790, 988, 1089, 1140, and 1291MeV/c. However, in all cases, data from the other experiment at nearby momenta show either no discrepancy or small ones. We therefore take these discrepancies to be due to experimental error or statistics. There is some discrepancy with d\u03c3/d\u2126 near cos \u03b8 = -1 at 467,497 and 585 MeV. We can find no solution which resolves this discrepancy without rapid changes with mass in high partial waves J = 4, 5 or 6; at these momenta, contributions from J = 5 and 6 should be small.OnFig. 2there are some discrepancies at individual momenta, but nothing systematic over a range covered by a resonance. Above 2 GeV/c, we are fitting only with tails of resonances from lower masses, plus resonances with J P = 6 + , 5 \u2212 , 4 + , and 2 + in the range 2500-2600 MeV. It seems likely that there will be further low spin resonances in this mass range. We have tried adding one by one resonances with J P = 3 \u2212 , 1 \u2212 and 0 + , but none gives a significant improvement in \u03c7 2 . For polarisation data onFig. 3, the agreement between data and fit is generally satisfactory and free of systematic trends.The fit to \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 data is shown inFig. 4and the accompanying paper on data analysis[1].
