The measurement in the dilepton channel was performed using 0.70 fb \u22121 of data and was combined with the lepton+jets channel result for our most precise tt cross-section measurement of \u03c3 pp\u2192tt+X = 176 \u00b1 5(stat) +13",

            "text": "Due to its high center of mass energy, the LHC is expected to produce large amounts of top quarks. The measurement of the production rate is an important milestone in the LHC's physics program. At the LHC, the majority of top quarks are produced in pairs from gluon-gluon fusion but if there is a yet undiscovered heavy particle, it may decay into top pairs and enhance the cross-section. In addition to pair production, top quarks can be produced individually through electroweak processes. Single top production was previously observed at CDF and D0 [6,7]. Nearly 100% of the time a top quark will decay into a b-quark and a Wboson. Experimentally, tt events are classified based on how the W -bosons decay. If both W -bosons decay leptonically, it is called the dilepton channel and if just one of the W -bosons decays leptonically, it is referred to as the lepton+jets channel. For the case when both decay hadronically, it is referred to as the all hadronic channel. For the rest of this article, the term lepton only refers to electrons and muons.",

We require a final state topology of one lepton (matched to the trigger object) and at least three jets. Additionally for the electron channel, E T miss > 35 GeV and transverse W -boson mass(m T ) > 25 GeV are added cuts and for the muon channel, E T miss > 20 GeV and E T miss + m T > 60 GeV are required conditions to pass the event selection.",

Monte Carlo is unreliable in predicting the QCD background so data-driven methods are used instead. The contribution from W+jets is estimated from LO Monte Carlo samples. Multivariate methods were used to extract the tt cross-sections from the data samples. Three uncorrelated variables, pseudo-rapidity of the lepton (\u03b7 lepton ), lepton charge (q lepton ) and the exponential of -8\u00d7 aplanarity (exp(\u22128 \u00d7 Aplanarity)), were selected and individual likelihoods were derived for each. These were multiplied together to form a total likelihood and this distribution was fitted to extract the cross-section. This method measured a tt cross- \u221220 (syst) \u00b1 6(lumi) pb, which is consistent with the other analysis. It is important to note that the two analyses are sensitive to different systematics. The analysis using b-tagging is sensitive to W bb, W cc and W c theory uncertainties while being less sensitive to QCD modeling than the other analysis.",

For same flavor channels, ee and \u00b5\u00b5, Drell-Yan processes contribute a substantial number of events. To reduce this number, events where m ll falls within a 10 GeV window around the Z-peak are rejected. To avoid light resonances, a cut of m ll >15 GeV is applied.
