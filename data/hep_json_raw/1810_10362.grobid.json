The simulation of the detector response is the main contribution to the time needed to simulate full events. This time scales linearly with the particle multiplicity. Of the dozens of particles present in the simulation only the few participating in the signal decay under study are of interest, while all remaining particles mainly affect the resolutions and efficiencies of the detector. This paper presents a novel development for the LHCb simulation software which re-uses the rest of the event from previously simulated events.

            "text": "A common challenge in many measurements performed in high-energy physics is the necessity to understand the effects of the detector response on the physics parameters of interest. This response is driven by resolution effects that distort the true distribution of a quantity and by inefficiencies that are introduced by either an imperfect reconstruction in the detector or a deliberate event selection, resulting in an unknown number of true events for a given number of reconstructed events. The extraction of an unbiased estimate of the physics parameter of interest requires the correction of these effects. However, due to increasing complexity of the detectors employed and the challenging experimental conditions -especially at a hadron collider -the only feasible solution is the generation of Monte Carlo (MC) events and the simulation of their detector response to study the evolution from the generated to the reconstructed and selected objects. In the era of the Large Hadron Collider, the simulation of the a e-mail: dominik.muller@cern.ch large event samples occupies a considerable fraction of the overall computing resources available. Hence, measures to decrease the time required to simulate an event are crucial to fully exploit the large datasets recorded by the detectors. In fact, recent measurements hinting at tensions with respect to the predictions of the Standard Model of elementary particle physics have systematic uncertainties that are dominated by the insufficient amount of simulated data [1]. Therefore, fast simulation options are necessary to further improve measurements such as these.",

Generally, the time needed to create an MC event for LHC experiments is dominated by the detector transport, accounting for 95-99% of the total time, which is proportional to the number of particles that need to be tracked. In the case that the intended measurement studies decays of heavy particles to exclusive final states with individual children being reconstructed for each particle, all long lived particles in the event can be split into two distinct groups: the particles that participate in the signal process and all remaining particles where the latter group is henceforth referred to as the rest of the event (ROE). As the final state of the signal process is usually comprised of only a few particles, most particles in the event are part of the ROE and hence the majority of the computing time per event is spent on the simulation of particles that are never explicitly looked at. Ideally, this situation should be inverted and most of the computing resources should be spent on simulating the signal decays themselves. However, simply simulating the signal process without any contributions from the ROE results in a much lower occupancy of the detector. This lower occupancy in turn leads to a significant mis-modelling of the detector response compared to the real detector: resolution effects are underestimated while reconstruction efficiencies are overestimated.",

This ensures that simulated energy deposits that stem from particles in the ROE can interfere with the deposits produced by the signal decay products, as is the case in the standard method to simulate events. Different complete events, for example obtained combining the same ROE with different signal decays, are themselves digitised independently. This further implies that each event obtained could have been produced by chance in a nominal simulation as ReDecay just reorders the already factorised approach: hadrons are decayed independently and the quasi-stable tracks are propagated through the detector individually. Therefore, the efficiencies and resolutions are, by construction, identical to those found in a nominal simulation. Furthermore, with increasing N ReDecay , the average time per created event becomes more and more dominated by the time required to simulate the detector response for the signal particle and its decay products compared to the simulation of the particles from the ROE. However, an attentive reader will have noticed that different events stemming from the same original event are correlated, e.g. they all have -bar resolution effects -the same signal kinematics. The magnitude of these correlations will also depend on the studied observables and the following section attempts to quantify the strength of the correlations. Additionally, it presents a method to take them into account in an analysis using simulated samples that have been generated following the ReDecay approach.",

Additionally, many observables are constrained by the fixed D 0 kinematics but have a certain amount of freedom in each redecayed event such as the transverse momentum of the K \u2212 . In the following, a simple example is used to develop methods to quantify the degree of correlation between different events and to discuss methods to take the correlations into account. Suppose x is a random variable, which is sampled in a two stage process: first, a random number x is sampled from a normal distribution N (0, \u03c3 1 ) with mean zero and width \u03c3 1 . Subsequently, a value for x is then obtained by sampling one number from a normal distribution N (x , \u03c3 2 ) with width \u03c3 2 that is centered at x .

However, the latter approach introduces correlations between different x values, which is visible in Fig. 1 as these correlations lead to an underestimate of the uncertainties when the values of x are filled into a histogram using uncertainties equal to \u221a N where N is the number of entries in the bin of the nominal distribution.

The autocorrelation itself is typically studied as a function of an integer offset \u03c4 , where \u03c4 = 0 is the trivial case with R(0) = 1. Example autocorrelations as a function of \u03c4 are given in Fig. 1 for multiple combinations of values for \u03c3 1 and \u03c3 2 with different ratios of \u03c3 2 /\u03c3 1 . As expected, the autocorrelation decreases both as a function of the offset \u03c4 as well as with increasing values for the ratio \u03c3 2 /\u03c3 1 . While the former is simply caused by a decreasing overlap between the blocks of x from the same x , the latter is a result of larger values of the ratio \u03c3 2 /\u03c3 1 corresponding to a greater amount of freedom in the random process for the generation of x despite using the same x . In summary, events are correlated though the amount of correlation depends on the studied observable. This explains the effect seen in the pulls where the approximation of \u221a N for the uncertainties breaks down in the presence of large correlations, when \u03c3 2 /\u03c3 1 is small. In the following, an alternative approach will be discussed to obtain the statistical uncertainty in the presence of such correlations. The effect of the correlations highly depends on how the sample is used and which variables are of interest and hence deriving a general, analytical solution is difficult if not impossible. In use cases where the variables of interest are sufficiently independent in every redecayed event (corresponding to a large \u03c3 2 /\u03c3 1 in the example above) even ignoring the correlations altogether can be a valid approach. Nonetheless, a general solution is provided by bootstrapping [4], which is a method for generating pseudo-samples by resampling. These pseudosamples can then be used to estimate the variance of complex estimators, for which analytic solutions are impractical.",

Then, entries are randomly drawn with replacement from the original sample N times to fill the pseudo-sample. As sampling with replacement is employed, the obtained pseudo-sample can contain some entries of the original sample multiple times while others are not present in the pseudo-sample at all. Unfortunately, this cannot directly be applied to the ReDecay samples because it assumes statistically independent entries. In the study of time series, data points ordered in time where each data point can depend on the previous points, different extensions of the bootstrapping algorithm have been developed to preserve the correlations in the pseudo-samples [5]. A common approach is the so-called block bootstrapping where the sample is divided into blocks. In order to capture the correlations arising in the ReDecay approach, a block is naturally given by all events using the same ROE (or the same x in the example above). To obtain a pseudo-sample, the bootstrapping procedure above is slightly modified: instead of sampling N individual entries from the original sample, entire blocks are drawn with replacement and all entries constituting a drawn block are filled into the pseudo-sample until the pseudo-sample has reached a size of N entries. From these pseudo-samples, derived quantities, e.g. the covariance matrix for the bins in the histogram in Fig. 1 (right), can be obtained and utilised to include the correlations in an analysis.",

In general, a speed-up by a factor of 10-20 is observed with the exact factor depending on the simulated conditions of the Large Hadron Collider and the complexity of the signal event. This factor is reached with a number of redecays per original event of N ReDecay = 100. In this configuration, and depending on the simulated decay, around 95% of the total time required to create the sample is spent on the simulation of the detector response of the products of the studied decay. Hence, increasing the number of redecays further would have little to no impact on the speed. Due to the correlations between different simulated events using the same ROE as described above, ReDecay samples are typically used to obtain efficiency descriptions as a function of final state variables with high granularity. For example, the use of the ReDecay method is ideal to study variables describing multi-body decays, since these variables are largely independent between all ReDecay events. An example for this is given in Fig. 2, which compares some distributions for D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 K + \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decays between a ReDe- Fig. 2 Comparison of a ReDecay sample with a nominally produced sample of D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 K + \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decays. Shown are the invariant mass squared of the kaon pair (left) and pion pair (right) which are both inde-pendent of the kinematics of the decaying particle. Displayed uncertainties are computed assuming independent events. There is no sign of the effects caused by correlated events as seen in Fig. 1 (right) cay and a nominally simulated sample. Despite ignoring the correlations and using uncertainties computed as \u221a N , sensible pull distributions with a width compatible with one are observed.",

While the increase in speed when using ReDecay is substantial, the time to produce events is still not negligible and creating a test sample of sufficient size can quickly overwhelm the resources available for an individual analyst. To this end and in collaboration with the respective developers, the ReDecay approach has been added to the RapidSim [14] generator to enable the fast production of simplified simulation samples to judge the degree of correlation before committing the resources for the production of a large ReDecay sample.",
