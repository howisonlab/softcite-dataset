During the last 3 years, the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has been colliding protons (and nuclei) at the highest center-of-mass energies ever studied in the laboratory (up to \u221a s = 8 TeV). Many measurements carried out by the different experiments provide new insights on the solution of both open issues. On the one hand, detailed LHC studies of the theory of the strong interaction (quantum chromodynamics, QCD) have resulted in valuable constraints on the Monte Carlo models used to interpret the extended air-showers produced by ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECR) colliding with air nuclei in the upper atmosphere. On the other, searches of dark matter (DM) particles -which escape the LHC detectors but can be discovered as an excess of events with missing transverse energy-have been carried out in different final-states corresponding to various visible particles accompanying DM production. The latest developments in UHECR and DM physics as well as the most relevant LHC measurements providing information on both key problems are summarized hereafter.",

The dominant source of uncertainty in the interpretation of the EAS data stems from our limitations to model particle production in strongly-interacting systems at c.m. energies up to \u221a s GZK \u2248 400 TeV, i.e. more than two orders of magnitude higher than those studied at particle colliders before the LHC. Indeed, even at asymptotically high energies the collision between two hadronic objects is sensitive to non-perturbative (hadronization, beam remnants, soft peripheral diffractive scatterings) as well as semihard (saturation of gluon densities, multiparton interactions) dynamics that need to be directly constrained from experimental data [10].",

First, although no model reproduced consistently all results, when taken together they \"bracketed\" the LHC data and could be globally trusted to interpret the EAS properties. Second, the absence of a drastic change in the properties of multiparticle production at the LHC (corresponding to energies E CR \u2248 10 16 eV), confirmed that the CR \"knee\" at 10 15.5 eV is not due to the production of new (unobserved) particles, as speculated in some cases, but to the change from a light to a more heavy mass CR composition. The update of the event generators to account for the LHC measurements has led to a convergence of their predictions: the X max slope has decreased (increased) for epos (qgsjet-II) and their N \u03bc values have raised at the highest CR energies (although they are still below the measured N \u03bc ). Around the GZK cutoff, the CR data prefer a mixed proton-iron composition (Fig. 2, right), with reduced model uncertainties (from \u223c50 g/cm 2 to \u223c20 g/cm 2 for values of X max where the proton-iron difference is about 100 g/cm 2 ) [11].",

The existence of DM is also supported by many cosmological observations such as (i) the large-scale structure of the universe given by galaxy distribution surveys confronted to statistical simulations [24]; (ii) the peak heights of the cosmic microwave background measured by WMAP and Planck [25,26] (lower than that expected in the absence of DM); plus (iii) other measures of matter density (baryon acoustic oscillations, big bang nucleosyntesis, supernova distances, etc.).

Popular theoretical extensions of the SM provide DM candidates such as (R-parity conserving) SUSY with a stable lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP, such as the neutralino or the gravitino), or the lightest Kaluza-Klein tower in extra-dimensions models. Other possibilities include heavy R-handed or sterile neutrinos, axions, or new particles of an unknown hidden sector.

Second, the retuning of the cosmic-rays hadronic MCs using LHC data supports a mixed composition of proton and heavier ions (\u03b1 particles and/or iron) at the tail of the cosmic ray spectrum up to E CR \u223c10 20 eV, with reduced model uncertainties (from \u223c50 g/cm 2 to \u223c20 g/cm 2 for the values of the X max shower maximum in the atmosphere) [11]. Upcoming LHC data studies will also help to solve the current disagreement between the observed and predicted number of muons at ground for the highest-energy showers.",

Searches of (R-parity conserving) SUSY at the LHC rely all in excess MET from leading DM candidates, such as neutralinos or gravitinos, for which no evidence has been found so far. The LHC has provided also the first constraints on direct Higgs boson couplings to the dark sector via H Z\u2192 \u03c7\u03c7 ll. The most generic DM searches in unbalanced monojet and monophoton final-states -where the DM particle is produced accompanied of initial-state QCD or QED radiation-have resulted in the lowest current limits for the \u03c7-N interaction cross-section, \u03c3 \u03c7\u2212N \u2248 10 \u221239 cm 2 (spin independent) and \u03c3 \u03c7\u2212N \u2248 10 \u221241 cm 2 (spin-dependent), at low dark-matter masses m \u03c7 10 GeV. The upcoming LHC operation in 2015, with p-p collisions at twice the energy of the first run, will provide a substantial increase in the sensitivity for dark matter searches.",
