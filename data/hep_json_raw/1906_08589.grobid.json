The diboson system is reconstructed using pairs of high transverse momentum, large-radius jets. These jets are built from a combination of calorimeter-and tracker-inputs compatible with the hadronic decay of a boosted W or Z boson, using jet mass and substructure properties. The search is performed for diboson resonances with masses greater than 1.3 TeV. No significant deviations from the background expectations are observed. Exclusion limits at the 95% confidence level are set on the production cross-section times branching ratio into dibosons for resonances in a range of theories beyond the Standard Model, with the highest excluded mass of a new gauge boson at 3.8 TeV in the context of mass-degenerate resonances that couple predominantly to gauge bosons.",

            "text": "The discovery of new phenomena in high-energy proton-proton (pp) collisions is one of the main goals of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). New heavy, TeV-scale, resonances of vector bosons V V (where V represents a W or a Z boson) are a possible signature of such new physics and are predicted in several extensions to the Standard Model (SM). These include extended gauge-symmetry models [1][2][3], Grand Unified theories [4][5][6][7], theories with warped extra dimensions [8][9][10][11][12], two-Higgs-doublet models [13], little-Higgs models [14], theories with new strong dynamics [15], including technicolour [16][17][18], and more generic composite Higgs models [19]. The data sample of 36.7 fb \u22121 of pp collisions collected in 2015 and 2016 at the LHC at \u221a s = 13 TeV offered improved sensitivity to heavy diboson resonances compared with earlier results. The ATLAS and CMS collaborations performed searches in the fully hadronic final states using this data [20][21][22] but no significant deviation JHEP09(2019)091 from a smooth background consistent with the SM expectation was observed. Searches by ATLAS [23,24] and CMS [25,26] for semileptonic decay modes of the boson pair, as well as statistical combinations of various decay channels [27], on the same data also did not reveal any hint of new physics.",

The W and Z bosons produced in the decay of TeV-scale resonances are highly boosted, and are therefore reconstructed in ATLAS as a single large-radiusparameter jet. The signature of such heavy resonance decays is thus a resonant structure in the dijet invariant mass spectrum. Although the hadronic decays of vector bosons have the largest branching ratio (67% for W and 70% for Z bosons), they suffer from background contamination from the production of multijet events. This background is larger by several orders of magnitude, and to suppress it, the characteristic jet substructure of W/Z boson decays is used. Contributions to the background from SM processes containing bosons, V + jets, SM V V , tt and single top production, are significantly smaller.",

Since the decay products of TeV-scale resonances are highly boosted, their decay products become increasingly collimated and they are therefore reconstructed as a single large-radius jet. It is important that they can still be differentiated from multijet events where a jet is initiated by a single quark or gluon. This relies on both the energy and angular resolution of the detector used to reconstruct the jet. Although the analysis primarily relies on jets, reconstruction of lepton candidates is necessary to reject events that could bias the SM V +jets studies presented in section 6.2.",

However, as the event becomes even more energetic, jets become so collimated that the calorimeter lacks the angular resolution to resolve the desired structure inside the jet. For boson jets with high transverse momentum, p T , only a handful of calorimeter-cell clusters are created, each with limited angular resolution, but excellent energy resolution. On the other hand, the tracking detector has excellent angular resolution and good reconstruction efficiency at very high energy [59], while its momentum resolution deteriorates. By combining information from the ATLAS calorimeter and tracking detectors, the precision of jet substructure techniques can be improved for a wide range of energies. This analysis uses a new unified object built from both the tracking and the calorimeter information, referred to as Track-CaloClusters (TCCs) [28]. This procedure is a type of particle flow, complementary to the energy subtraction algorithm described in the ATLAS particle flow paper [60] which improves the energy resolution of low-energy jets. The two algorithms are designed to improve the jet reconstruction performance in very different energy regimes, reflected in their distinct four-momentum construction and energy sharing procedures. Energy sharing in the TCC approach is based solely on a weighting scheme where only the relative track momenta are used to spatially redistribute the energy measured in the calorimeter. In practice, this means that the TCC algorithm uses the spatial coordinates of the tracker and the energy scale of the calorimeter. A more detailed description of TCCs can be found in ref.",

Combined TCCs are four-momenta created by combining the angular information of tracks with the energy information of the calorimeters. Neutral TCCs are calorimeter topo-clusters that could not be matched to any track, most likely representing energy deposits from neutral particles. The use of combined and neutral TCCs captures most of the hard-scatter energy and provides the best representation of the total energy flow in the event, as there are both charged and neutral contributions. from the primary vertex 2 are used. However, by including the neutral TCCs, these jets have a pile-up dependence similar to that of standard topo-cluster jets. Jets are therefore trimmed [61] to remove contributions from pile-up by removing any R = 0.2 subjet with less than 5% of the p T of the associated R = 1.0 jet. The clustering and trimming algorithms use the FastJet package [62]. The combination of pile-up suppression through track-to-primary-vertex matching and trimming makes these jets very robust against pileup [28]. A MC-based particle-level energy and mass calibration is applied to the jets, as described in ref. [63]. MC generator-level jets are built using the same algorithm and trimming procedure, with inputs of stable generator-level particles (c\u03c4 > 10 mm) excluding muons and neutrinos, and excluding particles from pile-up. These serve as the reference in figure 1. The energy and mass of MC generator-level jets also serves as reference to which reconstructed detector-level jets are corrected to in the above mentioned calibration procedure. Consequently, the mass of jets from V bosons is not expected to match the pole mass of the bosons.",

Figure 1 shows the striking improvement in D 2 resolutions 4 achieved with TCC jets. The mass resolution is superior to previously used jet mass variables (m comb [65]) starting around a jet p T of 2 TeV. Below 1 TeV, the mass resolution in TCC jets is degraded.

This number does not rely on a specific signal, but is valid for all signals with similar experimental features. Compared with the often used S/ \u221a B, that breaks down for small values of B, as is the case here, this measure is more appropriate. A value of a = 3 is used, where the result of the optimisation is not very sensitive to the exact value. For each jet p T bin, the optimal selection on the three variables is defined by the combination of selections that leads to the highest significance. This simultaneous treatment properly accounts for the correlations between the variables. The result of this optimisation does not depend on the pre-selections described at the beginning of this section. Next, the applied selection criteria on jet mass, D 2 , and n trk are parameterised with jet-p T -dependent functions. For the jet mass, the function follows its approximate experimental resolution. For the latter two a simple higher-order polynomial is used. The resulting smooth selections for the W and Z boson taggers as a function of jet p T are shown in figure 2. Jets selected in the analysis are required to have jet masses inside the jet mass window and D 2 and n trk values below the shown values.

The selection criteria retain about 20% efficiency for W and Z boson jets with p T = 0.5 TeV.

This is due to the behaviour of the multijet background, which decreases rapidly for high dijet masses, and thus higher jet p T .

This sample is obtained by requiring two large-radius jets with |\u03b7| < 2.0 and then requiring that the leading jet has p T > 600 GeV. A higher minimum p T requirement is imposed on the leading jet than in the nominal event selection to obtain a sample with higher average leading jet p T that better corresponds to the jet p T values probed in the search. Events with identified leptons are vetoed. Both jets are independently analysed for the presence of a vector boson by requiring them to satisfy the D 2 and n trk selection for either a W or a Z boson. The opposite jet is required to not satisfy the same D 2 selection to guarantee independence of this control region from the main analysis signal region. The mass distribution of the selected jets between 50 GeV and 200 GeV is fit by a signalplus-background function, allowing the inclusive rate of V + jets events to be measured. The contribution originating from V + jets processes is modelled using a double-Gaussian distribution with the shape parameters determined from simulation, while the background contribution is fit to data using a fourth-order exponentiated polynomial. The ability of  the fit to extract the correct V + jets yield (also called MC closure) is tested in simulation by injecting signals of various strengths. Good linearity is found and the method is deemed reliable. By comparing the measured event yield in data and MC simulation, potential differences in the selection efficiency (s Tag ) can be probed. Expected contributions of about 5% from tt events are subtracted based on MC simulation. The cross-section of V + jets at a V p T of about 600 GeV is modelled with about 10% accuracy by the simulation [70]. Additional systematic uncertainties in the fitted V + jets event yield from closure, from the uncertainty in the tt contribution, as well as from the fit parameterisation are considered. The relative efficiency of the D 2 and n trk selections is extracted for V bosons with p T starting from 600 GeV, while the analysis extends to p T = 3.5 TeV. To estimate the dependence of the modelling on the jet p T , the distribution of the D 2 and n trk variables is compared in an inclusive sample in data and MC simulation as a function of jet p T . The observed residual mismodelling as a function of jet p T is taken into account as an additional 5% uncertainty in the relative efficiency.",

The latter provides the highest sensitivity to the benchmark signals described in section 4.1 while the others probe the individual decay channels. Only the boson-tagging requirement differs between the regions. The highest mass jet of the two highest p T jets is considered as the candidate for the higher boson mass requirement. For the W Z selection this means that the highest mass jet must satisfy the Z boson selections and the second highest one the W boson selections. The selection requirements are summarised in table 1. The selection efficiency, defined as the number of selected events at different stages of the selection divided by the number of generated events, as a function of the resonance mass, is shown in figure 5 for the HVT Z decaying into W W and for the bulk G KK decaying into ZZ. Similar efficiencies are obtained in the W Z final state for the HVT model and in the W W final state for the bulk RS models. The figure shows that, among the different selection criteria described above, the boson tagging reduces the signal efficiency the most. However, this particular selection also provides the most significant suppression of the dominant multijet background. The resulting width of the m JJ distributions in the signal region for a HVT model A W \u2192 W Z (Bulk RS graviton \u2192 ZZ) is about 6% (10%) of its mean value across the mass range studied, corresponding to about 120 GeV (200 GeV) at 2 TeV.

The results of the search are shown for the W W + W Z, W W + ZZ channels, and are interpreted in terms of a radion model, two HVT benchmark models, and a bulk G KK model. The data are in agreement with the background expectations in all channels. Upper limits on the production cross-section times branching ratio to diboson final states for new resonances with masses greater than 1.3 TeV are set at the 95% CL. These results exclude at the 95% CL the production of W W + W Z from the HVT model A (model B) with g V = 1 (g V = 3) with masses in the range of 1.3 TeV-3.5 TeV (1.3 TeV-3.8 TeV). Production of a G KK in the bulk RS model with k/M Pl = 1 is excluded in the range 1.3 TeV-1.8 TeV, at the 95% CL.
