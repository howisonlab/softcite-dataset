We reconstruct twelve channels in four cascades using two complementary methods. In the first we identify both signal photon candidates in the Electromagnetic Calorimeter (EMC), employ a calorimeter timing-based technique to reduce backgrounds, and determine branching-ratio products and fine mass splittings. These results include the best observational significance yet for the \u03c7 b0 (2P ) \u2192 \u03b3\u03a5 (2S) and \u03c7 b0 (1P ) \u2192 \u03b3\u03a5 (1S) transitions. In the second method, we identify one photon candidate in the EMC and one which has converted into an e + e \u2212 pair due to interaction with detector material, and we measure absolute product branching fractions. This method is particularly useful for measuring \u03a5 (3S) \u2192 \u03b3\u03c7 b1,2 (1P ) decays. Additionally, we provide the most up-to-date derived branching fractions, matrix elements and mass splittings for \u03c7 b transitions in the bottomonium system. Using a new technique, we also measure the two lowest-order spin-dependent coefficients in the nonrelativistic QCD Hamiltonian.",

Potential models and lattice calculations provide good descriptions of the mass structure and radiative transitions below the open-flavor threshold. Precision spectroscopy probes spin-dependent and relativistic effects. Quark-antiquark potential formulations have been successful at describing the bottomonium system phenomenologically [1]. These potentials are generally perturbative in the short range in a Coulomb-like single-gluon exchange, and transition to a linear nonperturbative confinement term at larger inter-quark separation.

Radiative transition amplitudes between the long-lived bottomonium states are described in potential models in a multipole expansion with leading-order electric and magnetic dipole -E1 and M 1 -terms. The E1 transitions couple the S-wave \u03a5 (nS) states produced in e + e \u2212 collisions to the spin-one P -wave \u03c7 bJ (mP ) states; suppressed M 1 transitions are required to reach the spinsinglet states such as the ground-state \u03b7 b (1S).",

The hard transition rates are therefore less well-known, particularly for the J = 0 states, which have large hadronic branching fractions. In particular, the individual J = 0 hard transitions have been observed only by single experiments [16][17][18] and have yet to be confirmed by others.

The background spectrum of the MC ensemble is described well by the sum of a decaying exponential component with power \u03bb and a linear component with slope a 1 . The simplest approach to fitting the spectrum is to float both background parameters \u03bb and a 1 and float Gaussian means for the three signal peaks \u00b5 0 , \u00b5 1 and \u00b5 2 separately while sharing the floated signal shape parameters \u03c3, \u03b1 1 , \u03b1 2 , n 1 and n 2 between all three signal peaks. This approach assumes that the line shape does not vary in the limited photon energy range of this spectrum. However, fits of this nature on the MC ensemble spectrum perform poorly, indicating that line shape variation cannot be ignored. Conversely, fits with all twenty signal and background parameters floating independently perform equally poorly; in particular, the J = 0 peak tends to converge to a width well above or below the detector resolution.

Although it shares the same underlying physics as the calorimeter-based analysis, the presence of a displaced vertex and lack of calorimeter timing information necessitate some differences in approach. background (dash) components for the calorimeter-based analysis. The targeted \u03c7 b0 (1P ) signal corresponds to the small bump on the right; the integral ratio and mean offset of the fit to this peak compared to the J = 1 peak (center), are defined as f0 and \u03b40, respectively. Similarly, f2 and \u03b42 are the integral ratio and mean offset for the fit to the J = 2 peak (left), also compared to the J = 1 peak. (b) A zoomed-in view of the \u03c7 b0 (1P ) peak on the same energy scale. We reconstruct the \u03a5 (1S, 2S) final states with two opposite-sign muons within 100 MeV/c 2 of the relevant \u03a5 (nS) mass, satisfying a vertex probability \u03c7 2 of greater than 0.0001. The \u03c7 bJ (mP ) candidates are formed by constraining the \u03a5 (nS) to its nominal mass [23] and adding a converted photon (as described in detail in Ref. [19]). The initial \u03a5 (2S, 3S) candidate is reconstructed by combining a calorimeter-identified photon candidate with the \u03c7 bJ (mP ) candidate. This photon is required to have a minimum laboratory-frame energy of 30 MeV and lateral moment less than 0.8. The center-of-mass energy of the calorimeter photon is required to be in the range 300 < E \u03b3 < 550 MeV for the 3S \u2192 1P \u2192 1S decay chain, while for the other transitions it must be within E \u03b3(low) \u221240 < E \u03b3 < E \u03b3(high) +40 MeV, where E \u03b3(low) and E \u03b3(high) represent the lowest and highest energy transition for the intermediate \u03c7 bJ EMC timing measurement to take advantage of the timing-based selection described in Sec.IV A, \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 and \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 (\u03b3) backgrounds, which are also the dominant background sources for this analysis technique, are reduced via more conventional means. The number of charged-particle tracks in the event, as identified by the BABAR drift chamber and silicon vertex tracker [24], is required to be equal to four, incidentally removing all events used in the calorimeter-based analysis and resulting in mutually exclusive datasets. This selection also makes this dataset independent from the previous inclusive converted photon analysis [19], with the only commonality being shared uncertainties on the luminosity measurement and the conversion efficiency (described in Sec. V C). Events with an initial \u03a5 (nS) mass, M \u03a5 (nS) , in the range 10.285 < M \u03a5 (3S) < 10.395 GeV/c 2 or M \u03a5 (2S)(PDG) \u00b1 40 MeV/c 2 are retained. A requirement that the ratio of the second and zeroth Fox-Wolfram mo-ments [33] of each event, R 2 , be less than 0.95 is also applied.

The applied peak shift correction is \u22120.1 MeV, with maximal values ranging from \u22121.5 to 0.9 MeV, and the required energy resolution smearing is less than 0.2 MeV. These energy scale values are consistent with those found in the previous, higher-statistics, BABAR inclusive converted photon analysis [19], and the resolution smearing is small compared to the predicted resolution, which is of the order of a few MeV. Figures 6, 7, 8, and 9 show the results of the fits to the data. Compared to the calorimeter-based analysis, the statistical uncertainty in the converted-photon analysis is large and the systematic uncertainties do not readily cancel. Therefore, we quote the full product of branching fractions without normalization. The following section outlines the systematic uncertainties associated with these measurements.",

The derivation of branching fractions relies on efficiencies derived from MC simulation. There are several corrections (e.g. related to particle identification, reconstruction efficiency, etc.), with accompanying uncertainties, necessary to bring simulation and data into agreement. These are determined separately from this analysis, and are employed generally by all BABAR analyses. For muon identification, decay chain-dependent correction factors were estimated for each measurement, and found to be no larger than 1.3%, with fractional uncertainties of up to 3.3%. An efficiency uncertainty of 1.8% is used for the calorimeter photon, and 3.3% for the converted photon with a correction of 3.8% (as determined in Ref. [19]). Uncertainty due to applying the energy scale shift and resolution smearing to the 3S \u2192 1P \u2192 1S cascades is estimated by varying the shift and smearing over the full range of values measured by the other decay modes. The largest deviations from the nominal fit yields are taken as the uncertainty. For the J = 2(1) signal, the values are +2.0 \u22121.7 % ( +8.7 \u221211.5 %). The largest source of systematic uncertainty comes from the line shape used in the fit. To account for the possibility that the MC simulation does not represent the data, the data are refit using double-sided Crystal Ball functions for the signal line shapes for all but the lowstatistics 3S \u2192 1P \u2192 1S mode. All of the Crystal Ball shape parameters are allowed to float in the fit to the data except for the exponential power in the tail, to which the final fit result is found to be insensitive. The parameters of the background Gaussian function are allowed to float as well. The difference between the nominal fit and alternative fit yields is taken as a systematic uncertainty. These values range from 2% to as large as 50% for the low-yield J = 0 channels. The yield-weighted average of all these differences is calculated using the non-3S \u2192 1P \u2192 1S decay modes, and then conservatively symmetrized and applied to the 3S \u2192 1P \u2192 1S case. This value is found to be 5.9%.",
