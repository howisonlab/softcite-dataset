According to Sutherland and Bell [1,2], the electromagnetic contributions to this decay are small. Calculations of the electromagnetic corrections in chiral perturbation theory (\u03c7PT) at nextto-leading order (NLO), at the isospin limit, O(e 2 ) [3] and including isospin breaking to leading order, O(e 2 (m d \u2212 m u )) [4], show only small effects, confirming Sutherland and Bell's conlcusions. The \u03b7 \u2192 3\u03c0 decay thus proceeds mainly by strong interactions and the process can be calculated in \u03c7PT. Up to NLO the decay rate of \u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 is related to the quark mass ratio Q as follows:",

A NNLO \u03c7PT calculation was performed by Bijnens and Ghorbani (in leading order isospin breaking) [9], but at this order many Low Energy Constants must be fixed. Dispersion relations can be used to take into account the \u03c0\u03c0 interactions, and two recent different methods have been used to improve the NLO \u03c7PT result [10,11]. These promising methods can use as input the experimental Dalitz plot density information for the charged \u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 channel. Their predictions provide a precise determination of Q, and also provide an important consistency check, namely to get a reasonable agreement with the experimental results for the neutral channel \u03b7 \u2192 3\u03c0 0 . As one of the main sources of uncertainty on Q comes from the uncertainty on the input parameters, it is crucial to precisely measure the density distribution of the \u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 Dalitz plot.
