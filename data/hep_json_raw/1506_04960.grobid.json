By assuming the partial width of \u03c8(4S) \u2192 e + e \u2212 to be 0.63 keV, a branching fraction limit B(\u03c8(4S) \u2192 \u03b7J/\u03c8) < 1.3% is obtained at the 90% confidence level in e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b7J/\u03c8, which is consistent with the theoretical prediction.",

The upper limit on the number of \u03c8(4S) signal events is 22.7 at 90% C.L. There are several sources of systematic error for the branching fraction measurement. Most of the systematic errors are the same as those in Ref.
