In the standard model (SM) these decays are governed by the b \u2192 s and b \u2192 d weak transitions and are described by loop diagrams. They are suppressed due to the Glashow-Iliopoulos-Maiani mechanism [3] and the small values of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix elements involved [4,5]. This feature makes the B 0 s \u2192 f 0 (980)\u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 and B 0 \u2192 \u03c1(770) 0 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 decays sensitive probes of several SM extensions, since potential non-SM amplitudes may dominate over the SM contribution [6][7][8][9][10]. Current SM predictions of the B 0 s \u2192 f 0 (980)\u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 branching fraction vary from 10 \u22127 to 10 \u22129 [11][12][13]; similar values are expected for the B 0 \u2192 \u03c1(770) 0 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 branching fraction [14][15][16]. The predictions suffer from uncertainties in the calculation of the hadronic matrix elements associated with the transitions. For the B 0 s \u2192 f 0 (980)\u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 decay, the limited knowledge of the quark content of the f 0 (980) meson results in additional uncertainties. No experimental information exists on these decays to date. 1 The inclusion of charge-conjugate processes is implied throughout.",

The analysis is restricted to events with muons that do not originate from \u03c6, J /\u03c8, and \u03c8(2S) resonances, and with pion pairs with invariant mass in the range 0.5-1.3 GeV/c 2 . This mass range is set to include both f 0 (980) and \u03c1(770) 0 resonances, which overlap because of their large widths [17]. Other resonances, as well as non-resonant pions, might contribute [1,2]. However, due to the limited size of the data sample, an amplitude analysis of the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 mass spectrum is not attempted. The analysis is performed in a data set corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3.0 fb \u22121 , collected by the LHCb detector in protonproton (pp) collisions. The first 1.0 fb \u22121 of data was collected in 2011 with collisions at the centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV; the remaining 2.0 fb \u22121 in 2012 at 8 TeV. The signal yields are obtained from a fit to the unbinned \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 mass distribution of the decay candidates. The fit modelling and the methods for the background estimation are validated on data, by fitting",

The training is performed separately for the 2011 and 2012 data, and using simulations that reproduce the specific operational conditions of each year. The variables used in the BDT are the significance of the displacement from the PV of pion and muon tracks, the fit \u03c7 2 of the B 0 (s) decay vertex, the angle between the B 0 (s) momentum vector and the flight distance vector, the p T of the B 0 (s) candidate, the sum and the difference of the transverse momenta of pions, the difference of the transverse momenta of muons, the B 0 (s) decay time, and the minimum p T of the pions. The resulting BDT output is independent of the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 mass and PID variables.

To estimate this uncertainty, the difference in efficiencies between decays generated according to a phase-space model and to the model of Refs. [12,28,29] is considered. The resulting relative uncertainty is 5.4%. A relative uncertainty of 3.7% (2.8%) for 2011 (2012) data is estimated by considering the difference of the efficiencies evaluated in the simulation and in data for B 0 \u2192 J /\u03c8 K * (892) 0 decays. The same relative uncertainty is assigned to the efficiency associated with B 0 (s) \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 decays, as the cancellation of this uncertainty in the ratio of the efficiencies of signal and normalisation decays may not be exact.

The different centre-of-mass energies result in different bb production cross sections and selection efficiencies in the 2011 and 2012 data samples.

We also fit simultaneously the B 0(s) \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 and B 0 (s) \u2192 J /\u03c8 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 samples.The latter are selected with the B 0 (s) \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 requirements, except for the dimuon mass, which is restricted to the 2.796-3.216 GeV/c 2 range.

The background is subtracted using the sPlot technique [44] with the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 mass as the discriminating variable. The data show the dominance of the f 0 (980) resonance in the case of B 0 s \u2192 J /\u03c8 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decays, and of the \u03c1(770) 0 resonance in the case of B 0 \u2192 J /\u03c8 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decays, as expected from previous LHCb analyses [1,2]. The B 0 (s) \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 data show indications of a similar composition of the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 mass spectrum, although the size of the sample is not sufficient to draw a definite conclusion. Several systematic uncertainties on R s and R d are considered, as summarised in Table 2. The contribution due to the uncertainties on parameters that are fixed in the fit, and on the efficiencies and the yields of B 0 \u2192 J /\u03c8 K * (892) 0 decays that are fixed in Eq. (1), is obtained by repeating the fit, each time with the relevant parameters or inputs fixed to alternate values. These are sampled from Gaussian distributions centred at the nominal value, and whose widths correspond to the uncertainties on the fixed parameters and inputs. Known correlations between fixed parameters are taken into account. The r.m.s. spreads of the resulting R s and R d values are taken as the systematic uncertainties. The uncertainties associated with efficiencies are the sums in quadrature of their statistical and systematic uncertainties, reported in",

The contribution to the systematic uncertainty of R s due to the uncertainty on the values of f s / f d is also included. The final systematic uncertainties are the sums in quadrature of all contributions and correspond to 45% and 28% of the statistical uncertainties of R s and R d , respectively.6. ConclusionsThe first observation of the decay B 0 s \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 and the first evidence of the decayB 0 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 are ob-tained in a data set corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3.0 fb \u22121 collected by the LHCb detector in pp collisions at centre-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 TeV. The analysis is restricted to candidates with muon pairs that do not originate from \u03c6, J /\u03c8, and \u03c8(2S) resonances, while the pion pairs are required to have invariant mass in the range 0.5-1.3 GeV/c 2 . About 55 B 0 s \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 decays and 40 B 0 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 decays are observed with significances of 7.2\u03c3 and 4.8\u03c3 , respectively. Their branching fractions relative to the branching fraction of the B 0 \u2192 J /\u03c8(\u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 )K * (892) 0 (\u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212 ) decay are measured to be B(B 0 s",

The final selection efficiencies for 2011 and 2012 data are reported in Table 1. The statistical uncertainties are due to the size of the calibration and simulation samples; systematic uncertainties are described in what follows. The total efficiency varies by approximately 15% in the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 mass range considered and it is parametrised with a second-order polynomial.
