From a data set corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 , events containing one muon or electron and two or three jets are analysed. The cross section is measured as a function of the top quark transverse momentum ( p T ), rapidity, and polarisation angle, the charged lepton p T and rapidity, and the p T of the W boson from the top quark decay. In addition, the charge ratio is measured differentially as a function of the top quark, charged lepton, and W boson kinematic observables. The results are found to be in agreement with standard model predictions using various next-to-leading-order event generators and sets of parton distribution functions. Additionally, the spin asymmetry, sensitive to the top quark polarisation, is determined from the differential distribution of the polarisation angle at parton level to be 0.440 \u00b1 0.070, in agreement with the standard model prediction.",

They are called t channel (t ch) when the four-momentum is space-like, s channel when it is time-like, and W-associated (tW) when the four-momentum is on shell. At the CERN LHC, the production via the t channel has the largest cross section of the three modes whose most-relevant Born-level Feynman diagrams are shown in Fig. 1.

Furthermore, differential angular distributions can be used to assess the electroweak coupling structure at the Wtb vertex. A \"vector\u2212axial-vector\" (V\u2212A) coupling is predicted in the standard model (SM), leading to the production of highly polarised top quarks [14][15][16].

A brief description of the CMS detector is given in Sect. 2, followed by a summary of the analysed data and simulated event samples in Sect. 3. The reconstruction of physics objects and the event selection are detailed in Sect. 4. To determine the contributions from signal and backgrounds a maximum-likelihood fit (ML) is performed separately in each bin of the measurement. In the fit, shape distributions, referred to in the following as templates, are fitted to the data. For the signal and all background processes, samples of simulated events are used to determine the shape distributions, except for the templates of events containing only jets produced through the strong interaction, which are referred to as \"multijet\" events in this paper. The procedure to estimate the templates of multijet events based on data in a sideband region is provided in Sect. 5. Section 6 describes the measurement of the number of t-channel single top quark events from data through an ML fit. In the fit, statistical and experimental systematic uncertainties are profiled, where the latter encompasses uncertainties related to the reconstruction, identification, and calibration of the selected events and physics objects. The resulting distributions of the observables are validated in control and signal regions in Sect. 7. The fit results are input to an unfolding procedure to determine the differential cross sections and charge ratios at the parton and particle levels, as detailed in Sect. 8. The sources of experimental and theoretical systematic uncertainties are described in Sect. 9. The results are presented in Sect. 10 and the paper is summarised in Sect. 11.",

The influence of pileup is mitigated using the charged hadron subtraction technique [48]. The jet momentum is determined as the vectorial sum of all particle momenta in the jet. An offset correction is applied to the jet p T to account for contributions from pileup. Further corrections are applied to account for the nonuniform detector response in \u03b7 and p T of the jets. The corrected jet momentum is found from simulation to be within 2 to 10% of the true momentum over the whole p T spectrum and detector acceptance. The corrections are propagated to the measured p miss T .

The analysis considers jets within |\u03b7| < 4.7 whose calibrated p T is greater than 40 GeV, with the exception of the HCAL-HF transition region (2.7 < |\u03b7| < 3) in which jets must have a p T of at least 50 GeV to reduce the contribution from detector noise.

Background events containing top quarks (tt, tW) are grouped together, and only their total yield is estimated. The top quark background yield is constrained using a log-normal prior with a width of \u00b110% to account for the uncertainty in the theoretical tt and tW production cross sections, and the uncertainty when two out of the four jets expected from semileptonic tt production are not within the acceptance, as is the case in the 2j1b category. The electroweak background processes, W+jets and Z/\u03b3 * +jets, are grouped together as well, and an uncertainty of \u00b130% in their combined yield is applied using a log-normal prior constraint. This is motivated by the theoretical uncertainty in the modelling of the W and Z/\u03b3 * production rates in association with two or more (heavy-flavour) jets [53,54]. The yields of multijet events are assumed to be independent per lepton type and event category. Their yields are constrained by a log-normal prior with a width of \u00b1100% with respect to the template normalisations obtained from data in the sideband regions. In addition, an uncertainty in the predicted lepton charge ratio per background process, accounting for charge misreconstruction and uncertainties in the charge ratio [55], is taken into account using a Gaussian prior with a width of \u00b11% in the fit, for a total of 14 fit parameters. The impact of the finite number of simulated events on the templates is accounted for by employing the \"Barlow-Beeston-lite\" method [56].

To correct for this effect, simulated tt events are reweighted according to the scale factors derived from measurements at 13 TeV [65]. The difference in the predictions when using the default tt simulation sample is taken as an additional uncertainty. \u2022 Top quark mass: The nominal top quark mass of 172.5 GeV is modified by \u00b10.5 GeV in the simulation [66]. The difference with respect to the nominal simulation results is taken as the corresponding uncertainty. \u2022 Parton distribution functions: The effect of the uncertainty in the PDFs is estimated by reweighting the simulated events using the recommended variations in the NNPDF3.0 NLO set, including a variation of \u03b1 S [35]. The reweighting is performed using precomputed weights stored in the event record by the matrix element generator [67]. \u2022 Renormalisation/factorisation scales: A reweighting procedure similar to that used for the PDFs is carried out on simulated t-channel, W+jets, and tt simulated events to estimate the effect of the uncertainties in the renormalisation and factorisation scales. The weights correspond to independent variations by factors of 0.5 and 2 in the scales with respect to their nominal values. The envelope of all possible combinations of up-varied/down-varied scales with the exception of the extreme up/down combinations is considered as an uncertainty. This uncertainty is evaluated independently for the t-channel, W+jets, and tt simulated event samples. \u2022 Parton shower: The uncertainties in the parton shower simulation are evaluated by comparing the nominal sam-ples to dedicated samples with varied shower parameters. For t-channel single top quark production, the differences with respect to samples with a varied factorisation scale by a factor of 0.5 or 2 or with a varied powheg h damp parameter are taken as two independent uncertainties. For the simulated tt samples, the variation of the factorisation scale in both initial-and final-state radiation, and the h damp parameter are evaluated as three independent uncertainties. \u2022 Underlying event tune: The impact of uncertainties arising from the CUETP8M2T4 underlying event tune [30] used in the simulation of tt events is evaluated using dedicated samples with the tune varied within its uncertainties. \u2022 Colour reconnection: The default model of colour reconnection in pythia is based on multiple-particle interactions (MPI) with early resonance decays switched off. An uncertainty in the choice of this model is taken into account by repeating the measurement using three alternative models of colour reconnection in the simulation of t-channel single top quark and tt production: the MPI-based scheme with early resonance decays switched on, a gluon-move scheme [68], and a QCD-inspired scheme [69]. \u2022 Fragmentation model: The fragmentation of b quarks, modelled by the Bowler-Lund function [70], is varied within its uncertainties for t-channel single top quark and tt production.

It is found that the standard definition of the charge ratio in the literature, i.e. \u03c3 t /\u03c3\u00aft, can yield large variances when the precision in certain intervals of the differential cross section for the top antiquark is low. Therefore, the charge ratio is defined as \u03c3 t /\u03c3 t+t in this paper. The ratios have been calculated from the measured cross sections at the parton and particle levels, while accounting for correlations between the top quark and antiquark spectra, as detailed in Sects. 6 and 9. The resulting charge ratios are compared to the predictions by the NNPDF3.0 NLO, MMHT14 NLO [72], and CT10 NLO PDF sets, which have been calculated using the powheg signal sample-generated in the 4FS and interfaced with pythia. The uncertainty bands shown in Figs. 11 and 12 represent the total uncertainty from varying the corresponding PDF eigenvectors and \u03b1 S . Within the uncertainties, the measured charge ratios are in good agreement with the predictions from all three PDF sets.",

The cross sections are determined as a function of the top quark transverse momentum ( p T ), rapidity, and polarisation angle, the charged lepton p T and rapidity, and the p T of the W boson from the top quark decay. In addition, the charge ratio has been measured as a function of the top quark, charged lepton, and W boson kinematic observables. Events containing one muon or electron and two or three jets are used. The single top quark and antiquark yields are determined through maximum-likelihood fits to the data distributions. The differential cross sections are then obtained at the parton and particle levels by unfolding the measured signal yields.",
