The analysis uses data from proton-proton collisions at \u221a s = 13 TeV, collected with the CMS detector at the LHC in 2017 and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 37.5 fb \u22121 . While an observation of such a decay with this sample would indicate the presence of physics beyond the standard model, no significant excess is observed. Upper limits at 95% confidence level are placed on the branching fractions of these decays. In the J/\u03c8 pair channel, the limits are 1.8 \u00d7 10 \u22123 and 2.2 \u00d7 10 \u22126 for the Higgs and Z boson, respectively, while in the combined Y(nS) pair channel, the limits are 1.4 \u00d7 10 \u22123 and 1.5 \u00d7 10 \u22126 , respectively, when the mesons from the Higgs and Z boson decay are assumed to be unpolarized. When fully longitudinal and transverse polarizations are considered the limits reduce by about 22-29% and increase by about 10-13%, respectively.",

            "text": "A new boson with a mass of 125 GeV was discovered by the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations at the CERN LHC in 2012 [1][2][3][4][5][6][7]. Comprehensive studies in various decay channels and production modes have shown that the properties of the new boson are consistent, so far, with expectations for the standard model (SM) Higgs boson (H) [7][8][9]. Recently, the Higgs boson couplings to top and bottom quarks have been directly measured [10][11][12][13]. Couplings to lighter quarks are still not observed directly. Rare exclusive decays of the Higgs boson to mesons provide experimentally clean final states to study Yukawa couplings to quarks and physics beyond the SM (BSM). Examples of diagrams for decays of the Higgs and Z boson into quarkonium pairs are shown in Fig. 1. The symbol Q refers to charmonium and bottomonium states.",

[14] arrives at values of about B(H \u2192 J/\u03c8J/\u03c8) = 1.5 \u00d7 10 \u221210 and B(H \u2192 YY) = 2 \u00d7 10 \u22129 . The mechanism where the Higgs boson couples directly to charm or bottom quarks, which then hadronize to heavy quarkonia, was considered in a recent calculation [24] leading to an increase of an order of magnitude in B(H \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03b3). The Higgs boson decay to the J/\u03c8 pair could also occur when the photon in the J/\u03c8\u03b3 decay is virtual and transforms into a J/\u03c8 meson. Recently, the decay H \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03b3 has been searched for by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations [25,26]. This Letter also presents the first search for decays of the Z boson into quarkonium pairs. Feynman diagrams are shown in Fig. 1 (two rightmost plots). The SM prediction for B(Z \u2192 J/\u03c8J/\u03c8) calculated in the framework of nonrelativistic QCD and leading twist light cone models is of the order of 10 \u221212 [27]. Several approximations for the non-perturbative QCD processes are used, including the restriction to color-singlet quarkonium states.",

Forward calorimeters extend the pseudorapidity (\u03b7) coverage provided by the barrel and endcap detectors.

The muons are selected from the reconstructed muon track candidates that match with at least one segment in any muon station in both x and y. The number of silicon tracker layers with hits used in the muon track candidate has to be greater than 5 and include at least one pixel detector layer. Matching muons to tracks measured in the silicon tracker results in a relative transverse momentum (p T ) resolution of 1% in the barrel and 3% in the endcaps for muons with p T up to 100 GeV. The p T resolution in the barrel is better than 7% for muons with p T up to 1 TeV [52].",
