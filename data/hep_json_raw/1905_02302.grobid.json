The normalised differential cross section of top-quark pair production in association with an energetic jet is measured in the lepton+jets final state and unfolded to parton and particle levels. The unfolded distribution at parton level can be described using next-to-leading-order QCD predictions in terms of either the top-quark pole mass or the running mass as defined in the (modified) minimal subtraction scheme. A comparison between the experimental distribution and the theoretical prediction allows the top-quark mass to be extracted in the two schemes. The value obtained for the pole-mass scheme is:",

In the SM, the gauge structure of the interaction of the top quark with other particles establishes a relation between the top-quark, Higgs-boson and W -boson masses. A precise determination of these three parameters forms an important check of the internal consistency of the SM [1][2][3][4][5]. Precise measurements of the top-quark mass are also required in order to accurately predict the evolution of the Higgs quartic coupling at high scales, which affects the shape of the Higgs potential and is associated in the SM with the stability of the quantum vacuum [6,7]. In this article the top-quark mass is inferred from the shape of a differential cross-section distribution.",

Several groups have extracted the running 1 top-quark mass in the modified JHEP11(2019)150 minimal subtraction scheme (MS) from the total top-quark pair (tt) production cross section [15,16] or the differential cross section [17].

In this case the ambiguity related to the top-quark mass interpretation is avoided, allowing a precise evaluation of the uncertainty associated with the mass scheme chosen. In such measurements the Monte Carlo event generator is only used to correct distributions obtained from measured data for effects originating from the detector and the modelling of non-perturbative physics. The uncertainty associated to such effects can be estimated comparing Monte Carlo simulations produced with different sets of parameters, without specific assumptions on the top-quark mass interpretation. The theory uncertainty can then be estimated using the conventional techniques (scale variations and error sets of the parton distribution functions). Such mass measurements also yield greater flexibility in choosing the mass scheme [8,9].",

The particlelevel distribution is provided to allow comparisons with possible future calculations. A measurement of the top-quark pole mass [11] with this method using 4.6 fb \u22121 of 7 TeV pp JHEP11(2019)150 collisions collected by ATLAS yielded an uncertainty of 2.3 GeV (1.3%) in the top-quark pole mass. In the current analysis the top-quark mass is determined using a sample of 8 TeV pp collisions collected in 2012. The large statistics of the 8 TeV dataset make it possible to achieve a high precision in the measurement of the R distribution, in particular in the region where it is most sensitive to the top-quark mass, ultimately allowing the top-quark mass to be extracted with high accuracy.",

The cross sections are normalised to NNLO+NNLL calculations for t-channel [56], W t [57], and schannel production [58]. Leptonic decays of vector bosons produced in association with several high-p T jets, referred to as W +jets and Z+jets events, with up to five additional final-state partons in the leading-order (LO) matrix elements, were produced with the Alpgen generator [59] interfaced with Herwig for parton fragmentation using the MLM matching scheme [60]. Samples corresponding to the production of a W boson in association with heavy-flavour quarks (b-and c-quarks) were generated separately, at leading order and including effects from the value of the mass of the heavy quarks. Overlap between heavy-flavour quarks that originate from matrix-element production and those that originate from the parton shower was removed. The W +jets samples are normalised to the inclusive W -boson NNLO cross section [61,62].",

The term  Uncertainties in the modelling of the jet energy response are taken into account by varying the jet energy scale (JES ) within its uncertainty for a number of uncorrelated components [84][85][86]. A separate uncertainty is assigned to the b-quark jet energy scale (bJES ), which is uncorrelated with the JES. Systematic effects that affect the jet energy resolution (JER) and jet reconstruction efficiency are taken into account by smearing the jet energy and by randomly removing a fraction of the jets, respectively. Uncertainties originating from b-jet tagging/mistagging efficiency are also considered (b-tagging efficiency and mistag). Scale factors are applied to correct for the difference between efficiencies measured in data and in simulated events [68,70]. The uncertainties in these correction factors are propagated to the measurement (Lepton). The modelling of E ulations produced with a different matrix-element generator (Powheg and aMC@NLO) are compared to evaluate the uncertainties in the calculation of the matrix elements (Signal MC generator ). Uncertainties in tt modelling coming from the parton shower and hadronisation model (Shower and hadronisation) are evaluated by comparing Pythia 6 with Herwig, both interfaced with Powheg.

Uncertainties coming from the choice of parameter values that control initial-and final-state radiation (ISR/FSR), the colour reconnection (Colour reconnection) and underlying-event modelling (Underlying event) are estimated following the scheme of ref. [88]. The uncertainty in the modelling of background processes is evaluated by varying the normalisation and shape of several sources (Background ). The normalisation is varied within the cross-section uncertainty for single-top (\u00b17.8%) and V +jets (\u00b133%) backgrounds, while the data-driven multijet contribution is scaled by \u00b150% [63].

The uncertainty due to the truncation of the perturbative series is evaluated with the conventional procedure of varying the factorisation (\u00b5 f ) and renormalisation (\u00b5 r ) scales by factors of 2 and then 1/2 from the nominal scale \u00b5 f = \u00b5 r = m t (Scale variations). The scale uncertainty is taken as the mass shift for the alternative scale choices and is typically asymmetric. A positive (negative) shift of the extracted top-quark mass is found when decreasing (increasing) the renormalisation scale. Additional tests were performed in order to gain confidence in the values presented in table 2. The scale variation has a larger impact in the MS mass scheme, as already observed in ref. [17]. A redundancy exists between the theoretical uncertainty obtained from the scale variations and the one considered by the initial/final radiation, which is not subtracted. The uncertainty due to PDFs and the parametric uncertainty in the strong coupling constant, \u03b1 s , is evaluated by generating the prediction for three consistent choices of PDF set and \u03b1 s : CT10nlo with \u03b1 s (m Z ) = 0.118 (nominal), MSTW2008nlo90cl with \u03b1 s (m Z ) = 0.120 and NNPDF23 with \u03b1 s (m Z ) = 0.119. The uncertainty is taken as half the envelope of the mass values extracted from the three choices mentioned above (Theory PDF \u2295\u03b1 s ). The total theory uncertainty is obtained by adding the scale and PDF uncertainties in quadrature. The parton shower barely affects the theoretical prediction [11] and its associated uncertainty is negligible.",
