            "text": "In proton-proton (pp) collisions at the CERN LHC, top quarks are produced mainly in pairs (tt) and subsequently decay to b quarks and W bosons: pp \u2192 tt \u2192 W + bW \u2212 b. The decay modes of the two W bosons determine the observed event signature. The dilepton decay channel denotes the case where both W bosons decay leptonically. In this paper, we consider the process tt \u2192 ( \u03bd )(\u03c4\u03bd \u03c4 )bb, where one W boson decays into \u03bd where is either an electron (e) or a muon (\u00b5), and the other into a tau lepton and a neutrino (\u03c4\u03bd \u03c4 ). The expected fraction of events in this final state corresponds to \u22484/81 (\u22485%) of all tt decays, i.e. equivalent to the fraction of all light dilepton channels (ee, \u00b5\u00b5, e\u00b5).",

            "text": "Recent checks of lepton flavour universality violation [1-8] sparked a renewed interest towards measurements involving \u03c4 leptons, owing to a potential disagreement with standard model (SM) predictions. The t \u2192 (\u03c4\u03bd \u03c4 )b decay exclusively involves third-generation leptons and quarks which, owing to their large masses, may be particularly sensitive to beyond SM contributions. For example, the existence of a charged Higgs boson [9][10][11][12] may give rise to anomalous \u03c4 lepton production that could be observed in this decay channel. This is the first measurement of the tt production cross section in pp collisions at \u221a s = 13 TeV that explicitly includes \u03c4 leptons. The data sample was collected in 2016 with the CMS detector at the LHC and corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 . The \u03c4 lepton is identified through its visible decay products, either hadrons (\u03c4 h ) or leptons -1 -JHEP02 (2020)191(\u03c4 ), with the corresponding branching fractions B(\u03c4 h \u2192 hadrons + \u03bd \u03c4 ) \u2248 65% and B(\u03c4 \u2192 \u03bd \u03bd \u03c4 ) \u2248 35%. In the first case, the \u03c4 h decays into a narrow jet with a distinct signature, whereas the leptonic decays are difficult to distinguish from prompt electron or muon production. In this measurement, the signal includes only \u03c4 leptons that decay hadronically, and does not include leptons from \u03c4 decays. The dominant background contribution comes from events where a jet is misidentified as a \u03c4 h , mostly from tt lepton+jets events, i.e. tt \u2192 ( \u03bd )(qq )bb. The cross section is measured by performing a profile likelihood ratio (PLR) fit [13] to the transverse mass of the system containing the lepton (e or \u00b5) and the missing transverse momentum, in two kinematic categories of the selected events for each of the e\u03c4 h and \u00b5\u03c4 h final states. The cross section is measured in the fiducial phase space of the detector and also extrapolated to the full phase space. The ratio of the cross sections in the \u03c4 and light dilepton [14] final states \u03c3 tt ( \u03c4)/\u03c3 tt ( ), and the ratio of the partial to the total decay width of the top quark \u0393(t \u2192 \u03c4\u03bd \u03c4 b)/\u0393 total are evaluated.",

Within the solenoid volume are a silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter, and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter, each composed of a barrel and two endcap sections, covering 0 < \u03d5 < 2\u03c0 in azimuth and |\u03b7| < 2.5 in pseudorapidity. Forward calorimeters extend the pseudorapidity coverage provided by the barrel and endcap detectors. Muons are detected in gas-ionization chambers embedded in the steel flux-return yoke outside the solenoid. The detector is nearly hermetic, providing reliable measurement of the momentum imbalance in the plane transverse to the beams. A two-level trigger system [15] selects the most interesting pp collision events for use in physics analysis. A more detailed description of the CMS detector, together with a definition of the coordinate system used and the relevant kinematic variables, can be found in ref. [16].",

The parton showers are modelled using pythia (v8.2) [22] with the CUETP8M2T4 underlying event (UE) tune [23]. The background samples used in the measurement of the cross section are simulated with powheg and MadGraph5 amc@nlo (v2.2.2) [24]. The Mad-Graph5 amc@nlo generator with MLM matching [25] is used for the simulation of W boson production in association with jets (W+jets), and Drell-Yan (DY) production in association with jets at leading-order (LO) accuracy. Here, only the leptonic decays of DY events and W bosons are simulated, and up to four additional jets are included. The diboson processes are produced with NLO accuracy: WW with powheg, WZ and ZZ with MadGraph5 amc@nlo with FxFx matching [26]. The powheg generator is used for the simulation of t-channel single top quark production and single top quark production associated with a W boson (tW) [27,28]. The single top quark s-channel sample is produced with MadGraph5 amc@nlo at NLO accuracy with FxFx matching scheme. The simulated events are produced with a top quark mass of m t = 172.5 GeV. The generated events are subsequently processed with pythia using the underlying event tune CUETP8M1 to provide the showering of the partons, and to perform the matching of the soft radiation with the contributions from direct emissions included in the matrix-element (ME) calculations. The default parton distribution functions (PDFs) are the NNPDF3.0 [29]. The \u03c4 decays are simulated with pythia, which correctly accounts for the \u03c4 lepton polarization in describing the kinematic properties of the decay. The CMS detector response is simulated with Geant4 [30]. Additional pp interactions in the same or nearby bunch crossings (pileup, PU) are superimposed on the hard collision. Simulated events are reweighted to match the distribution of the number of pileup collisions per event in data. This distribution is derived from the instantaneous luminosity and the inelastic cross section [31].",

In each jet, a charged hadron is combined with other nearby charged hadrons or photons to identify the decay modes. The identification of \u03c0 0 mesons is enhanced by clustering electrons and photons in \"strips\" along the track bending direction to take into account possible broadening of calorimeter signatures by early showering photons. The \u03c4 h candidates are selected from the following combinations of charged hadrons and strips that correspond to the \u03c4 decay modes: single hadron, hadron plus a strip, hadron plus two strips, and three hadrons. A multivariate analysis of these HPS \u03c4 h candidates is used to reduce the contamination from quark and gluon jets. A boosted decision tree is trained using a sample of DY events with \u03c4 h decays as signal and a sample of QCD multijet events as background, both from simulation. Input variables include the multiplicity and the transverse momenta of electron and photon candidates in the vicinity of the \u03c4 h , the kinematic properties of hadrons and strips, and the \u03c4 h lifetime information, such as the impact parameter of the leading track and the significance of the length of flight to the secondary vertex of the \u03c4 h candidates with three charged hadrons. Additional requirements are applied to discriminate genuine \u03c4 h leptons from prompt electrons and muons. The \u03c4 h charge is taken as the sum of the charges of the corresponding charged hadrons. The misidentification probability for the charge is less than 1% and it is estimated from Z \u2192 \u03c4\u03c4 \u2192 \u00b5\u03c4 h data events with same-charge \u00b5 and \u03c4 h . The \u03c4 h identification JHEP02(2020)191 efficiency of this algorithm is estimated to be approximately 60% for p T > 20 GeV, and it is measured in a sample enriched in Z \u2192 \u03c4\u03c4 \u2192 \u00b5\u03c4 h data events with a \"tag-and-probe\" technique [46].

The largest background contribution arises from tt lepton+jets events, tt \u2192 ( \u03bd )(qq )bb, where one jet is misidentified as the \u03c4 h . The background contribution is constrained in a fit to the distribution of the transverse mass of the light lepton and missing transverse momentum system in two event categories, constructed according to the kinematic properties of the jets in the tt lepton+jets final state. The signal enters as a free parameter without constraining the kinematic properties of the \u03c4 lepton.

The higher precision is achieved through a shape fit to the kinematic distributions of the events, thus better constraining the backgrounds. The measurement of the ratio of the cross section in the \u03c4 h final state to the light dilepton cross section [14] yields a value of R \u03c4 h / = 0.973 \u00b1 0.009 (stat) \u00b1 0.066 (syst), consistent with lepton universality.
