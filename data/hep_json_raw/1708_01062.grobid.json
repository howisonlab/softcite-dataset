The search uses data collected by the CMS experiment in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV in 2016, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 . The presence of forward jets is a particular characteristic of single production of vector-like quarks that is used in the analysis. For the first time, different T quark width hypotheses are studied, from negligibly small to 30% of the new particle mass. At the 95% confidence level, the product of cross section and branching fraction is excluded above values in the range 0.26-0.04 pb for T quark masses in the range 0.7-1.7 TeV, assuming a negligible width. A similar sensitivity is observed for widths of up to 30% of the T quark mass. The production of a heavy Z boson decaying to Tt, with T \u2192 tZ, is also searched for, and limits on the product of cross section and branching fractions for this process are set between 0.13 and 0.06 pb for Z boson masses in the range from 1.5 to 2.5 TeV.",

If the T is a doublet of the SM, the decay modes are tZ and tH, each with a branching fraction of 0.5. The T quark could be singly produced in association with either a t or a b quark and an additional quark would be produced in the forward region of the detector. The coupling coefficients of the T quark to SM particles are denoted C(bW) for the T(b) process, and C(tZ) for the T(t) process. The production cross section of the T quark depends on its mass and width, as well as on these couplings. The T quark can have both left-handed (LH) and righthanded (RH) couplings to SM particles. In the case of a singlet T quark, the RH chirality is suppressed by a factor proportional to the SM quark mass divided by the T quark mass. In the case of a doublet T quark, it is the LH chirality that is suppressed [32].",

The jet energy scale (JES) is calibrated through correction factors dependent on the p T , \u03b7, energy density, and area of the jet. The jet energy resolution (JER) for the simulated jets is degraded to reproduce the resolution observed in data. The AK4 jet candidates are required to have p T > 20 GeV, |\u03b7| < 2.4 and to be separated by R > 0.4 from an identified lepton. The AK8 jet candidates are required to have p T > 180 GeV, |\u03b7| < 2.4 and to be separated by R > 0.8 from an identified lepton. The AK8 jets may be tagged as coming from a W boson decaying to q q (denoted \"W jets\") or from a t quark decaying fully hadronically (\"t jets\"). For the W jets, a pruning algorithm [57] is applied. The mass of the jet, after the pruning is performed, is used as a discriminant to select W bosons and reject quark and gluon jets. The discrimination between W jets and jets from quarks and gluons is further improved by requiring the N-subjettiness ratio \u03c4 21 to be less than 0.6, where \u03c4 21 = \u03c4 2 /\u03c4 1 [58], and the mass of the pruned AK8 jet to be within the range 65-105 GeV. In a similar way, AK8 jets may be identified as arising from the all-jets final state of a t quark. These t jets are required to have p T > 400 GeV, mass of the jet reconstructed through the modified mass drop tagger algorithm [59,60] between 105 and 220 GeV, and \u03c4 32 = \u03c4 3 /\u03c4 2 less than 0.81. Finally, AK4 jets may be tagged as arising from a b quark (\"b jets\") using the combined secondary vertex algorithm [61,62]. A \"medium\" working point with an efficiency of 70% for genuine b jets and a rejection of 99% of light-flavor jets is used, together with a \"loose\" working point that has an 85% identification efficiency and rejects 90% of light-flavored jets. The efficiency for identifying W, t, and b jets in simulation is corrected to match the results found in data.",

The small differences between the observation and the prediction for the closure test described previously are taken as systematic uncertainties (6%). An uncertainty due to possible mismodeling of the Z + light quark and Z + b quark fractions in the simulation is evaluated. This systematic uncertainty is evaluated by observing the effect of changing the Z + b fraction by 10% [63], yielding a contribution to the uncertainty in the background estimation of between 2 and 4%. Finally, the uncertainty from the b tagging for the b, c, and light-flavor jets is evaluated by changing the b tagging corrections by their uncertainties [61,62], yielding a change in the normalization of 2% for the b tagging efficiency and 2% for the misidentification probability. Other systematic uncertainties related to the simulation modeling have been studied and found negligible, because of the data-driven method used to estimate the background.",

No deviations were observed relative to the expected standard model background. Upper limits on the product of the cross section and branching fraction range between 0.26 and 0.04 pb at 95% confidence level for a left-handed T quark produced in association with a b quark, T(b), and between 0.14 and 0.04 pb for a right-handed T quark produced in association with a t quark, T(t), for the range of masses between 0.7 and 1.7 TeV. This result was obtained under the hypothesis of a narrow-width T quark, providing an interpretation of results through the simplified approach of Ref. [4]. In this case, left-handed T quarks produced in association with a b quark and with a coupling C(bW) of 0.5 were excluded for masses in the range 0.7-1.2 TeV. A large gain in the search sensitivity was found relative to previous results [18] because of improvements introduced in the analysis as well as the increase in the integrated luminosity. The effect of a nonnegligible width was also studied; values of the width between 10 and 30% of the T quark mass were considered, and similar sensitivities were observed. The results were interpreted using a modified version of the model constructed by the authors of Refs. [5,46,47], and a left-handed T(b) signal was excluded for masses below values in the range 1.34-1.42 TeV, depending on the width, while a right-handed T(t) signal was excluded for masses below values in the range 0.82-0.94 TeV. Finally, the production of a Z boson that decays to Tt was excluded for values of the product of cross section and branching fractions between 0.13-0.06 pb, for Fig. 6.
