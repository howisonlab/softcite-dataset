The search considers the Z boson decaying to electrons or muons and the H boson into a pair of b-quarks. No evidence for the production of an A boson is found. Considering each production process separately, the 95% confidence-level upper limits on the pp \u2192 A \u2192 ZH production cross-section times the branching ratio H \u2192 bb are in the range of 14-830 fb for the gluon-gluon fusion process and 26-570 fb for the b-associated process for the mass ranges 130-700 GeV of the H boson and 230-800 GeV of the A boson. The results are interpreted in the context of two-Higgs-doublet models.",

Such extensions are motivated by, and in cluded in, several new physics scenarios, such as supersymme try [5], dark matter [6] and axion [7] models, electroweak baryogenesis [8] and neutrino mass models [9].",

The phenomenology of such a model is very rich and depends on many parameters, such as the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two Higgs doublets (tan \u03b2 ), and the Yukawa couplings of the scalar sec tor [4]. When CP conservation is assumed, the model contains two CP-even Higgs bosons, h and H with mH > mh , one CP-odd, A, and two charged scalars, H \u00b1 . There have been many searches for the heavy neutral Higgs bosons of the 2HDM at the LHC, includ ing H \u2192 WW/ ZZ [10][11][12][13], A/H \u2192 \u03c4\u03c4/bb [14][15][16], A \u2192 Zh [17,18] and H \u2192 hh [19,20].

Such a case is motivated by electroweak baryogenesis scenarios in the context of the 2HDM [21][22][23][24]. For 2HDM electroweak baryogenesis to occur, the requirement m A > mH is favoured [21] for a strong first-order phase transition to take place in the early universe. The A boson mass is also bounded from above to be less than approximately 800 GeV, whereas the lighter CP-even Higgs boson, h, is required to have properties simi lar to those of a Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson and is assumed to be the Higgs boson with mass of 125 GeV that was discovered at the LHC [21]. Under such conditions and for large parts of the 2HDM parameter space, the CP-odd Higgs boson, A , decays into ZH [25,21]. The production of the A boson in the relevant 2HDM parameter space proceeds mainly through gluon-gluon fusion and b-associated production at the LHC.",

This final state allows full reconstruction of the A boson's decay kinematics. The reconstruction of the A boson's invariant mass uses the assumed value of the mass of the H bo son to improve its resolution. The final state is also categorised by the presence of two or three b-tagged jets to take advantage of the b-associated production mechanism. The CMS Collaboration has published a similar search at s = 8 TeV [26].

For top-quark-pair production, a very pure (> 99% of predicted events) control region is used to de termine the normalisation of the background, whereas its shape in the signal region is taken from the simulation. This control region is defined by keeping the same selection as discussed previously, apart from an opposite-flavour lepton criterion, i.e., an opposite charge e\u03bc pair is required instead of an ee or \u03bc\u03bc pair (see also Table 1). The shape of the Z +jets background distribution is ob tained from simulation and the normalisation is extracted from data together with the signal (see also Section 7). This procedure is possible because of the very different shapes of the m^^bb dis tributions from signal and Z +jets events. The normalisation of the Z +jets production is further constrained by a control region de fined by inverting the mbb window criterion for each H boson mass hypothesis (see also Table 1). The control regions are distinct for the nb = 2 and the nb \u2265 3 categories, since the accuracy of the background simulation depends on the number of b-jets present in the event. Backgrounds from diboson, single top, and Higgs bo son production, as well as top-quark-pair production in association with a vector boson, give a typical contribution of \u223c 5% to the total background. Their shapes are taken from simulation, whereas they are normalised using precise inclusive cross-sections calculated from theory. The diboson samples are normalised using next-tonext-to-leading-order (NNLO) cross-sections [65][66][67][68]. Single-top quark production and top-quark-pair production in association with vector bosons are normalised to next-to-leading-order (NLO) cross-sections from Refs. [69][70][71] and Ref. [31], respectively. The normalisation of the Higgs boson production in association with a vector boson follows the recommendations of Ref. [36] using NNLO QCD and NLO electroweak corrections.",

This is due to the few cases in which the b-quark produced in association with the Higgs boson is taken to be one of the b-quarks from the Higgs boson decay. The values of the function parameters are extracted from unbinned maximum-likelihood fits to the simulated m^^bb distribu tions. The core mean, a, is parameterised using a linear function of mA. The core width, \u03c3 , is observed to monotonically increase with ^m \u2261 m A -m H and is parameterised with a third-degree polyno mial. The rest of the parameters are largely constant and are fixed to their average values from the fits, with the exception of mass points with ^m = 100 GeV. The distributions at mass points with ^m = 100 GeV correspond to the smallest mass splitting consid ered in this search and are close to the kinematic cutoff. Their non-core parameters are fixed to the average fit values obtained from signal samples with this mass splitting only. As an example of the performance of this procedure, Fig. 1 shows a comparison for the (mA, mH) = (500, 250) GeV mass point between the simulated distributions and the parametric functions described previously. The cores of the m^^bb distributions are well-parameterised by the chosen functional forms. The small differences seen in the tails of some distributions between the functional forms and the simula tions have only negligible effects on the final results, and moreover they are included as a source of systematic uncertainty.",

The procedure is validated by comparing the results of the convolution with those of the simulated samples of A bosons with large natural widths. Widths of up to 20% of the A boson mass are considered. An example of signal distributions with large natural widths is shown in Fig. 2 for the same signal points used in Fig. 1.

Therefore m^^bb is chosen as the final signal and background discriminating variable. The shape differences in the m^^bb distribution between the signal and background contri butions are exploited through binned maximum-likelihood fits of the signal-plus-background hypotheses to extract potential signal contributions. The fits are based on the statistical framework de scribed in Refs. [75][76][77]. For a given mass hypothesis of (mA, mH ), the likelihood is constructed as the product of Poisson statistics in m^^bb bins: Only the nb = 2 category is considered for the gluon-gluon fu sion production while both the nb = 2 and nb \u2265 3 categories are included in the likelihood calculation for the b-associated produc tion. For each bin, S i is calculated from the total integrated lumi nosity, the theoretical cross-section for the signal and its selection efficiency. The sum of all background contributions in the bin, Bi , is estimated from simulation. However, the tt\u00af and Z +jets con trol regions are included in the likelihood calculation as one bin each, to help constrain their respective contributions in the sig nal regions. This is achieved by introducing two free normalisation scale factors, represented by \u03b1^ , for each category for the two most relevant background contributions: one for tt\u00af and the other for the heavy-flavour component ( Z +h.f.) of the Z +jets contribution. These scale factors are applied to their respective contributions es timated from the simulations and their values are determined from the fit. Typical values of scale factors are close to unity. Taking (mA, mH) = (700, 200) GeV as an example, the Z+h.f. scale factor is 1.12 \u00b1 0.09 for the nb = 2 category and 1.1 \u00b1 0.2 for the nb \u2265 3 category. Similarly, the tt\u00af scale factors are 0.96 \u00b1 0.06 and 1.2 \u00b10.2 for the two corresponding categories.",

They include both the experimental and theoretical sources of uncertainty. Experimental uncertainties comprise those in the luminosity measurement, trigger, object identification, energy/momentum scale and resolution as well as underlying event and pile-up modelling. These uncertainties, discussed in Refs. [61,10], impact the simulations of signal and background processes. Theo retical uncertainties include both the signal and background mod elling. For the signal modelling, uncertainties due to the factori sation and renormalisation scale choice, the initial-and final-state radiation treatment and the PDF choice are considered. Additional systematic uncertainties are assigned to cover the differences in signal efficiencies and m^^bb parameter values between the inter polations and the simulations. For the background modelling, the most important sources of systematic uncertainty are from the modelling of the mbb and the pT^ distributions of Z +jets. They are taken to be the difference between the data and simulation of the selected samples before the event categorisation and the mbb re quirement. The samples are dominated by the Z +jets contribution, and any potential signal contamination is expected to be negligi ble. For other background processes, they are obtained by varying the factorisation and renormalisation scales, the amount of initialand final-state radiation, and the choices of PDF parameterisations.",

Upper limits on \u03c3 \u00d7B(A \u2192 ZH) \u00d7 B(H \u2192 bb) with \u03c3 here including contributions from both processes are recalculated and compared with the 2HDM predictions to derive the limits in the 2HDM parameter space. Fig. 6 shows the observed and expected limits for Type I, Type II, 'lepton specific' and 'flipped' 2HDMs in the (mA, mH ) plane for various tan\u03b2 values. Type-II and flipped show similar constraints because in these models the Yukawa couplings are the same for all fermions apart from leptons. The same holds when comparing Type-I and lepton-specific 2HDM, where the main reason for the difference in sensitivity is the in creased significance of the H \u2192 \u03c4\u03c4 decay in the lepton-specific model. The gluon-gluon fusion production cross section decreases with increasing tan\u03b2, which explains the loss of sensitivity in Type-I and lepton specific for large tan\u03b2 values. In the case of Type-II and flipped, at large tan\u03b2 values it is the b-associated pro duction that dominates instead of the gluon-gluon fusion in this region. For instance the exclusion can reach up to mH \u2248 400 GeV at lower tan\u03b2 (less than 10) and mH \u2248 600 GeV at higher tan\u03b2 (more than 20). At low tan \u03b2 values the Higgs boson branching fraction to tt\u00af becomes sizable, and this is what limits the sensitiv ity to below mH \u2248 350 GeV in all models examined here. The last bin is used as a reference for normalisation, and its width is noted in the y -axis label. In this case, the content displayed in a bin is the number of events shown in that bin multiplied by the ratio of widths of the last bin relative to the bin shown.",

The A boson is assumed to be produced via either gluon-gluon fusion or b-associated production. No significant deviation from the SM background predictions are observed in the ZH\u2192 ^^bb final state that is considered in this search. Considering each production pro cess separately, upper limits are set at the 95% confidence level for \u03c3 \u00d7 B( A \u2192 ZH) \u00d7 B(H \u2192 bb) of 14-830 fb for gluon-gluon fusion and 26-570 fb for b-associated production of a narrow A boson for the mass ranges 130-700 GeV of the H boson and 230-800 GeV of the A boson.

The results of the search are interpreted in the context of the 2HDM. For this interpretation, several assumptions are made to re duce the number of free parameters in the model. The charged Higgs boson is assumed to have the same mass as the A boson. The 2HDM parameter m1 22 is fixed to m2 A tan \u03b2/(1 + tan2 \u03b2). The lightest Higgs boson of the model, h , is assumed to have a mass of 125 GeV and its couplings are set to be the same as those of the SM Higgs boson, by choosing cos(\u03b2\u03b1) = 0. The widths of the A and H bosons are taken from the predictions of the 2HDM.
