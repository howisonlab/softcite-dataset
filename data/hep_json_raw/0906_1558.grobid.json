            "text": "I began my career as a nuclear physicist. So, my first run in with exotica was in the search for exotic nuclei. Nuclei are exotic if they are very rich in neutrons, i.e., have an exceptionally large value of (N \u2212Z)/A., or if they are just very heavy, A \u226b 240. In the 1970's, there were no easy ways of making a nucleus which was very rich in neutrons, like 18 C with 6 protons and 12 neutrons. And so we went for it by the very exotic pion double charge exchange (DCX) reaction (\u03c0 + , \u03c0 \u2212 ). We discovered 18 C by the reaction 18 O(\u03c0 \u2212 , \u03c0 + ) 18 C [1]. That was exciting. As I said before, exotica is addictive. So, after 18 C we went for 9 He, 2 protons+7 neutrons, (N \u2212 Z)/A = 5/9, by means of the reaction 9 Be(\u03c0 \u2212 , \u03c0 + ) 9 He [2]. We found it, and Bethe called it \"a drop of neutron star\". How much more exotic can you get? Well, how about 6 H by 6 Li(\u03c0 \u2212 , \u03c0 + ) 6 H. We tried and failed to find it, bound or unbound [3].",

            "text": "I now return to the domain of Exotica. Recently, a number of new states have been claimed in the mass region 3800-4700 MeV, above the DD breakup of charmonium at 3730 MeV. Three years ago, all that was known above DD was four vector states \u03c8(3770, 4040, 4160, and 4415) observed as enhancements in the ratio, R = \u03c3(hh)/\u03c3(\u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ). However, the great excitement, often called the renaissance in hadron spectroscopy, has come from the recent discovery of a whole host of unexpected states by the meson factory detectors, Belle and BaBar. The new states are called \"charmonium-like states\", not because they naturally fit into the spectrum of charmonium states, but because they seem to always decay into final states containing a charm quark and an anti-charm quark. There are at least eleven of them around. The alphabet soup is getting thick with reports of X(3872), Y(4260), Y(4361), Y(4660), X(3940), Y(3940), Z(3940), X(4160), Z \u00b1 (4430), Z \u00b1 1 (4051) and Z \u00b1 2 (4248). Except for the first two, X(3872) and Y(4260), which have been observed in measurements at several laboratories, the remaining nine come exclusively from Belle. They have not been reported by BaBar with similar capabilities, and in two cases, Y(4325) and the Z \u00b1 , they have been contradiected by BaBar. Reminds you of the old dibaryon story. I do not want to express my skepticism any further, but tell you only about the two certain exotics, X(3872) and Y(4260).",

Since its mass is very close to M (D) + M (D * ), the most popular conjecture is that it is a weakly bound molecule of D and D * . If so, our recent precision measurement of D 0 mass at CLEO gives M (D 0 D 0 * ) = 3871.81 \u00b1 0.36 MeV. This corresponds to X(3872) being unbound by 0.4 \u00b1 0.8 MeV. If X(3872) were even bound by \u223c 0.4 MeV, the branching fraction for the molecule's breakup into DD\u03c0 is predicted to be factor 400 smaller than observed.
