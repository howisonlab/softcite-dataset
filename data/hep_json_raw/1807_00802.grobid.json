            "text": "Following the observation of a Higgs boson H with a mass of approximately 125 GeV by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations [1,2], detailed measurements of its properties show no deviations from the Standard Model (SM) [3]. However, its role in fermion mass generation is still to be shown experimentally. In the SM, this mass generation is implemented through Yukawa interactions, and many theories beyond the SM predict substantial modifications of the relevant Higgs boson couplings to fermions. The ATLAS and CMS collaborations have reported measurements of the Higgs coupling to a third-generation fermion with a significance greater than five standard deviations in the H \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 channel [3][4][5]. In addition, progress has been made in the third-generation quark sector with indirect evidence of the coupling of the Higgs boson to the top quark [3]. This was recently complemented by direct observation of the associated production of the Higgs boson with a top-quark pair (tt H) [6,7]. Evidence of Higgs boson decays into bb has also been found with a significance in excess of three standard deviations by both ATLAS and CMS [8][9][10]. No experimental evidence of Higgs boson decays into the first-and second-generation fermions has yet been found, but direct searches were recently performed by the ATLAS Collaboration for H \u2192 cc [11] and H \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 [12, 13] and by the CMS Collaboration for H \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 and H \u2192 e +   [17,18], are smaller due to a cancellation between the \"direct\" and \"indirect\" amplitudes. The direct amplitude proceeds through the H \u2192 qq coupling with a subsequent photon emission before the qq hadronisation to \u03d2(nS). The indirect amplitude proceeds via the H\u03b3 \u03b3 coupling followed by the fragmentation \u03b3 * \u2192 \u03d2(nS).",

These deviations can arise in beyondthe-SM theories; for example, the quark masses might not originate entirely from the Higgs mechanism but could also be induced by other subdominant sources of electroweak symmetry breaking [21]. Other scenarios include the minimal flavour violation framework [22], the Froggatt-Nielsen mechanism [ Owing to the large Z boson production cross section at the LHC, rare Z boson decays can be probed at much lower rates than for Higgs boson decays into the same final state. Branching fractions for Z \u2192 Q \u03b3 decays have been calculated to be between 10 \u22128 and 10 \u22127 for both the Z \u2192 J /\u03c8 \u03b3 and Z \u2192 \u03d2(nS) \u03b3 decays [32][33][34]. Measurements of the branching fractions for these decays would provide a sensitive test of the SM and the factorisation approach in quantum chromodynamics (QCD), since the power corrections in terms of the ratio of the QCD energy scale to the vector-boson mass are small [33].

            "text": "The data samples used in this analysis were collected by a combination of two triggers [36]. The first required an isolated photon with transverse momentum p Higgs boson production was modelled using the Powheg-Box v2 Monte Carlo (MC) event generator [38][39][40][41][42] with CT10 parton distribution functions [43] for the gluon-gluon fusion (gg H) and vector-boson fusion (VBF) processes. Both processes were calculated up to next-to-leading order (NLO) in \u03b1 S . Powheg-Box was interfaced with Pythia 8.186 [44,45] to model the parton shower, hadronisation, and underlying event with the AZNLO set of tuned parameters [46]. Additional contributions from the associated production of a Higgs boson and a W or Z boson (denoted W H and Z H, respectively) were modelled by the Pythia 8.186 event generator [44,45] with NNPDF23LO parton distribution functions [47] and the A14 set of tuned parameters for hadronisation and the underlying event [48]. The production rates for the SM Higgs boson with m H = 125 GeV, obtained from the compilation in Ref. [27], are assumed throughout this analysis. The gg H production is normalised such that it reproduces the total cross section predicted by a next-to-next-to-next-to-leading-order QCD calculation with NLO electroweak corrections applied [49][50][51][52]. The VBF production is normalised to an approximate next-to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO) QCD cross section with NLO electroweak corrections applied [53][54][55]. The production of W H and Z H is normalised to cross sections calculated at NNLO in QCD with NLO electroweak corrections [56,57] including the NLO QCD corrections [58] for gg \u2192 Z H. The production of a Higgs boson in association with tt (tt H) or bb (bbH) is accounted for by scaling the total cross section used to normalise the gg H signal sample, assuming the signal efficiency of these processes to be equal to that for gg H. The ad-dition of tt H and bbH to the gg H signal changes the acceptance by less than 1%.",

To mitigate the effects of multiple pp interactions in the same or neighbouring bunch crossings, only ID tracks that originate from the primary vertex are considered. The transverse momentum of the ID track associated with the leading muon is subtracted from the sum, and the subleading muon is also subtracted if it falls within the isolation cone. To reject backgrounds from b-hadron decays, the signed projection of the Q candidate's flight distance between the primary pp vertex and the dimuon vertex onto the direction of its transverse momentum is required to be less than three times its uncertainty. Photons are reconstructed from clusters of energy in the electromagnetic calorimeter. Clusters without matching ID tracks are classified as unconverted photon candidates while clusters matched to ID tracks consistent with the hypothesis of a photon conversion into e + e \u2212 are classified as converted photon candidates [66]. Reconstructed photon candidates are required to have transverse momentum p \u03b3 T > 35 GeV and pseudorapidity |\u03b7 \u03b3 | < 2.37, excluding the barrel/endcap calorimeter transition region 1.37 < |\u03b7 \u03b3 | < 1.52, and to satisfy the \"tight\" photon identification criteria [66]. Isolation requirements are imposed to further suppress the contamination from jets. The sum of the transverse momenta of all tracks originating from the primary vertex, within 1R = 0.2 of the photon direction, excluding those associated with reconstructed photon conversions, is required to be less than 5% of p \u03b3 T . In addition to this track isolation criterion, a calorime-ter isolation criterion is applied where the sum of the transverse momenta of calorimeter energy clusters within 1R = 0.4 of the photon direction, excluding the transverse energy of the reconstructed photon, is required to be less than",

The branching fraction for H \u2192 J /\u03c8 \u03b3 has been calculated within the SM to be B(H \u2192 J /\u03c8 \u03b3 ) = (2.99 +0.16 \u22120.15 ) \u00d7 10 \u22126 [17]. Other recent results on these calculations are given in Refs. [18-20]. For H \u2192 \u03c8(2S) \u03b3 the branching fraction was calculated by the authors of Ref. [17] to be B(H \u2192 \u03c8(2S) \u03b3 ) = (1.03 \u00b1 0.06) \u00d7 10 \u22126 using an estimate for the value of the order-v 2 NRQCD long-distance matrix element. The corresponding decays in the bottomonium sector, H \u2192 \u03d2(1S, 2S, 3S) \u03b3 , can provide, in combination with H \u2192 bb decays, information about the real and imaginary parts of the b-quark coupling to the Higgs boson [19], which could probe potential CP violation in the Higgs sector. However, the expected SM branching fractions, B(H \u2192 \u03d2(nS) \u03b3 ) = (5.22 +2.02 \u22121.70 , 1.42 +0.72 \u22120.57 , 0.91 +0.48 \u22120.38 ) \u00d7 10 \u22129 (n = 1, 2, 3)",
