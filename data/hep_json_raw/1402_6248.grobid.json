Five interfering \u03c0 \u00fe \u03c0 \u2212 states are required to describe the decay: f 0 \u00f0980\u00de; f 0 \u00f01500\u00de; f 0 \u00f01790\u00de; f 2 \u00f01270\u00de, and f 0 2 \u00f01525\u00de. An alternative model including these states and a nonresonant J=\u03c8\u03c0 \u00fe \u03c0 \u2212 component also provides a good description of the data. Based on the different transversity components measured for the spin-2 intermediate states, the final state is found to be compatible with being entirely CP odd. The CP-even part is found to be < 2.3% at a 95% confidence level. The f 0 \u00f0500\u00de state is not observed, allowing a limit to be set on the absolute value of the mixing angle with the f 0 \u00f0980\u00de of < 7.7\u00b0at a 90% confidence level, consistent with a tetraquark interpretation of the f 0 \u00f0980\u00de substructure.",

While the CP content was previously shown to be more than 97.7% CP odd at a 95% confidence level (C.L.), it is important to determine the size of any CP-even components, as these could ultimately affect the uncertainty on the final result for \u03d5 s . Since the \u03c0 \u00fe \u03c0 \u2212 system can form light scalar mesons, such as the f 0 \u00f0500\u00de and f 0 \u00f0980\u00de, we can investigate if these states have a quark-antiquark or tetraquark structure, and determine the mixing angle between these states [2].

Here, the \u03c0 \u00fe \u03c0 \u2212 mass and all three decay angular distributions are used to determine the resonant and nonresonant components. Previously, the angle between the decay planes of J=\u03c8 \u2192 \u03bc \u00fe \u03bc \u2212 and \u03c0 \u00fe \u03c0 \u2212 in theB 0 s rest frame, \u03c7, was integrated over. This simplified the analysis, but sacrificed some precision and also prohibited us from measuring separately the helicity \u00fe1 and \u22121 components of any \u03c0 \u00fe \u03c0 \u2212 resonance, knowledge of which would permit us to evaluate the CP composition of resonances with spin greater than or equal to 1. Since one of the particles in the final state, the J=\u03c8, has spin 1, its three decay amplitudes must be considered, while the \u03c0 \u00fe \u03c0 \u2212 system is described as the coherent sum of resonant and possibly nonresonant amplitudes.",

            "text": "The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 3 fb \u22121 collected with the LHCb detector [8] using pp collisions. One third of the data was acquired at a center-ofmass energy of 7 TeV, and the remainder at 8 TeV. The detector is a single-arm forward spectrometer covering the pseudorapidity range 2 < \u03b7 < 5, designed for the study of particles containing b or c quarks. The detector includes a high-precision tracking system consisting of a siliconstrip vertex detector surrounding the pp interaction region, a large-area silicon-strip detector located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4 Tm, and three stations of silicon-strip detectors and straw drift tubes [9] placed downstream. The combined tracking system provides a momentum 3 measurement with relative uncertainty that varies from 0.4% at 5 GeV to 0.6% at 100 GeV, and an impact parameter (IP) resolution of 20 \u03bcm for tracks with large transverse momentum (p T ). Different types of charged hadrons are distinguished by information from two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors (RICH) [10]. Photon, electron, and hadron candidates are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter, and a hadronic calorimeter. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers [11].",

In the simulation, pp collisions are generated using PYTHIA [13] with a specific LHCb configuration [14]. Decays of hadronic particles are described by EVTGEN [15], in which final-state radiation is generated using PHOTOS [16].

A similar situation is found for the \u03c1\u00f0770\u00de state. When including it in the fit, the fit fraction of \u03c1\u00f0770\u00de is measured to be \u00f00.60 AE 0.30 \u00fe0.08 \u22120.14 \u00de% in Solution I and \u00f01.02 AE 0.36 \u00fe0.09 \u22120.15 \u00de% in Solution II. The largest upper limit is obtained by Solution II, where the \u03c1\u00f0770\u00de fit fraction is less than 1.7% at 90% C.L. Our previous study [3] did not consider the f 0 \u00f01790\u00de resonance; instead, the NR component filled in the highermass region near 1800 MeV. It is found that including f 0 \u00f01790\u00de improves the fit significantly in both solutions.

The total S-wave amplitude is calculated as Eq. 4summing over all spin-0 component R with \u03bb \u00bc 0, where the d function is equal to 1. The amplitude strength can be well measured from the m\u00f0\u03c0 \u00fe \u03c0 \u2212 \u00de distribution, but this is not the case for the phase, which is determined from the interference with the small fraction of higher spin resonances.",

The moment distributions provide an additional way of visualizing the presence of different resonances and their interferences, similar to a partial wave analysis. Figures 19 and 20 show the distributions of the angular moments for 5R Solution I and 5R \u00fe NR Solution II, respectively. In general, the interpretation of these moments [3] is that hY 0 0 i is the efficiency-corrected and background-subtracted event distribution, hY 0 1 i is the interference of the sum of S-wave and P-wave and P-wave and D-wave amplitudes, hY 0 2 i is the sum of the P-wave, D-wave and the interference of S-wave and D-wave amplitudes, hY 0 3 i is the interference between the P-wave and D-wave amplitudes, hY 0 4 i is D wave, and hY 0 5 i is F wave. The values of hY 0 1 i and hY 0 3 i are almost zero, because the opposite contributions from B 0 s andB 0 s decays are summed. Note that in this analysis, the Pwave contributions are zero, so the above description simplifies somewhat. The f 2 \u00f01270\u00de and f 0 2 \u00f01525\u00de interference with S waves are clearly shown in the hY 0 2 i plot [see Figs. 19(c) and 20(c)].  ",

To obtain the corresponding upper limit, the covariance matrix and parameter values from the fit are used to generate 2000 sample parameter sets. For each set, the CP-even fraction is calculated and is then  smeared by the systematic uncertainty. The integral of 95% of the area of the distribution yields an upper limit on the CP-even component of 2.3% at a 95% C.L., where the larger value given by Solution II is used. The upper limit is the same as our previous measurement [3], while the current measurement also adds in a possible f 0 2 \u00f01525\u00de contribution.",
