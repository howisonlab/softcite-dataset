We compare the photon \u00fe jet mass distribution to a background model derived from data and find consistency with the background-only hypothesis. Given the lack of evidence for a signal, we set 95% credibility level limits on generic Gaussian-shaped signals and on a benchmark excited-quark (q \u00c3 ) model, excluding 2 TeV Gaussian resonances with cross section times branching fraction times acceptance times efficiency near 5 fb and excluding q \u00c3 masses below 2.46 TeV, respectively.",

Direct photon \u00fe jet production occurs at tree level via Compton scattering of a quark and a gluon or through quark-antiquark annihilation, the former accounting for the majority of direct photon \u00fe jet production at all center-ofmass energies. Events with a high transverse momentum photon and one or more jets can also arise from radiation off final-state quarks or from multijet processes where dijet or higher-order events produce secondary photons during fragmentation of the hard-scatter quarks and gluons [1][2][3][4]. The photon \u00fe jet invariant mass (m j ) [5] distribution resulting from this mixture of processes is smooth and rapidly falling, constituting a promising place to look for resonances.",

It follows earlier measurements of isolated photon differential cross sections at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) [20,21]. The entire m j distribution is fit to a smooth function to obtain the background to this search. We look for evidence of a narrow resonance, not much wider than the detector mass resolution. This search extends the method used in the search for resonant dijet production [22] to handle the more diverse mixture of processes contributing to the m j distribution. In the absence of a signal, we use Bayes' theorem to set limits on Gaussian-shaped resonances and on a benchmark excitedquark (q \u00c3 ) model [6,7]. In the excited-quark model studied here, the LHC could produce single q \u00c3 states with vectorlike couplings to the W and Z gauge bosons via the absorption of a gluon by a quark. As in Ref. [7], we define the model by one parameter, the excited-quark mass m q \u00c3 , setting the compositeness scale equal to m q \u00c3 and SU(3), SU (2), and",

The functional form also describes the leading-order PYTHIA direct photon prediction for comparable event statistics. We search for statistical evidence of a resonance in this distribution using the BUMPHUNTER algorithm [39]. The algorithm operates on the binned m j distribution, comparing the background estimate with the data in mass intervals of varying contiguous bin multiplicities across the entire distribution. For each interval in the scan, it computes the significance of any excess found. The algorithm identifies the interval 784-1212 GeV, indicated by the vertical lines in Fig. 1, as the single most discrepant interval. The significance of the outcome is evaluated using the ensemble of possible outcomes for the significance of any region in the distribution in the background-only hypothesis, obtained by repeating the analysis on pseudodata drawn from the background function. Before including systematic uncertainties, the probability (p value) of observing a background fluctuation at least as significant as the above, including the trials factor, or ''look-elsewhere'' effect, is 20%.

To extrapolate this uncertainty to large m j where few control data exist, we fit the tail m j > 1 TeV with a two-degree polynomial. Figure 2 shows the model-independent limits on the effective cross section, cross section times branching fraction B times acceptance A times efficiency , of a potential signal as a function of the central mass of each signal template.

The limit weakens as the width increases and the peak becomes less distinct. For example, for a 1 TeV signal the limit for a width of 10% is 1.6 times the limit for a width of 5%.

            "text": "In conclusion, the photon \u00fe jet mass distribution measured in 2:11 fb \u00c01 of pp collision data collected at ffiffi ffi s p \u00bc 7 TeV by the ATLAS Collaboration has been examined for narrow resonances. The observed distribution extends up to masses of about 2 TeV. It is well described by a smooth function fitted to it and assumed to represent the SM expectation. No evidence for the production of resonances is found. We set limits at 95% CL on the Gaussian line shape and excited-quark signal using Bayesian statistics. The limits on Gaussian resonances, for example, exclude 2 TeV resonances with effective cross sections near 5 fb. We also exclude the excited-quark model in the photon \u00fe jet final state for masses up to 2.46 TeV. The limits reported here on the resonant production of new particles in the photon \u00fe jet final state are the most stringent limits set to date in this channel. We thank CERN for the very successful operation of the LHC, as well as the support staff from our institutions without whom ATLAS could not be operated efficiently.
