This analysis is based on the data sample containing 772 \u00d7 10 6 BB pairs that was collected with the Belle detector at the KEKB energy-asymmetric e + e \u2212 collider.

The measured value is consistent with predictions of the SM. The result for the difference of CP asymmetries is \u2206ACP = (+2.4 \u00b1 2.8(stat.) \u00b1 0.5(syst.))%, consistent with zero. The measured branching fractions and CP asymmetries for charged and neutral B meson decays are the most precise to date. We also calculate the ratio of branching fractions of B 0 \u2192 K * 0 \u03b3 to B 0 s \u2192 \u03c6\u03b3. Radiative b \u2192 s\u03b3 decays proceed predominantly via one-loop electromagnetic penguin diagrams. This process is also possible via annihilation diagrams; however, the amplitudes are highly suppressed by O(\u039b QCD /m b ) and CKM matrix elements [1,2] in the Standard Model (SM) [3,4]. Since new heavy particles could contribute to the loops, the b \u2192 s\u03b3 process is a sensitive probe for new physics (NP). Furthermore, new particles could mediate the annihilation diagrams or effective four-fermion contact interactions with different magnitudes in charged and neutral B meson decays, so that the penguin dominance in b \u2192 s\u03b3 might be violated. The B \u2192 K * \u03b3 decay [5] is experimentally the cleanest exclusive decay mode among the B \u2192 X s \u03b3 decays. The branching fractions give weak constraints on NP since the SM predictions suffer from large uncertainties in the form factors, while the isospin (\u2206 0+ ) and direct CP asymmetries (A CP ) are theoretically clean observables due to cancellation of these uncertainties [6]. The \u2206 0+ , A CP , and difference and average of A CP between charged and neutral B mesons (\u2206A CP and\u0100 CP ) are defined as \u2206 0+ = \u0393(B 0 \u2192 K * 0 \u03b3) \u2212 \u0393(B + \u2192 K * + \u03b3) \u0393(B 0 \u2192 K * 0 \u03b3) + \u0393(B + \u2192 K * + \u03b3) ,",

Predictions of the isospin asymmetry range from 2% to 8% with a typical uncertainty of 2% in the SM [6][7][8][9][10][11], while a large deviation from the SM predictions is possible due to NP [7,9,10]. A CP is predicted to be small in the SM [6,10,12,13]; hence, a measurement of CP violation is a good probe for NP [14]. The isospin difference of direct CP violation is theoretically discussed in the context of inclusive B \u2192 X s \u03b3 process [15] but heretofore not in the exclusive B \u2192 K * \u03b3 channel; however, \u2206A CP here will be useful to identify NP once A CP is observed.",

Input parameters are the efficiencies for B + , B \u2212 , B 0 andB 0 decays, the number of BB pairs, \u03c4 B + /\u03c4 B 0 = 1.076 \u00b1 0.004, f +\u2212 = 0.514 \u00b1 0.006 and f 00 = 0.486 \u00b1 0.006 [20]. Here, we assume the uncertainties in f +\u2212 and f 00 are perfectly anti-correlated. In the likelihood fit, we can also determine \u2206A CP ,\u0100 CP and \u2206 0+ . The combined A CP (B \u2192 K * \u03b3) is then obtained by repeating the fit with the constraint A N CP = A C CP . The main sources of the systematic uncertainty for the branching fraction measurements are the photon detec-tion efficiency (2.0%), the number of BB pairs (1.4%), the \u03c0 0 detection efficiency (1.3%), f +\u2212 /f 00 (1.2%), and the peaking background yield (1.1% to 1.6%). For the modes with a \u03c0 0 in the final state, fitter bias (1.3% to 2.4%) and fixed parameters in the fit (1.5% to 3.9%) are also significant sources of uncertainty. The contamination from B \u2192 X s \u03b3 events that include a higher-mass kaonic resonance decaying to K\u03c0 is checked by looking at B \u2192 K\u03c0\u03b3 events with M K\u03c0 less than 2.0 GeV/c 2 . The M K\u03c0 distribution is fit with a P-wave relativistic Breit-Wigner for K * (892) and a D-wave relativistic Breit-Wigner function for K * 2 (1430) and the resulting uncertainty is 0.31%. We also check the helicity distribution of the K\u03c0 system for K * \u03b3 candidates and find that the distribution is consistent with a P-wave. For the \u2206 0+ measurement, the dominant systematic uncertainty is that due to f +\u2212 /f 00 (1.16%); the second largest is related to particle identification (0.38%). The largest systematic uncertainty for the A CP and \u2206A CP measurements is from the charge asymmetries in charged hadron detection. The charged-pion detection asymmetry is measured using reconstructed B \u2192 K * \u00b1 \u03b3, K * \u00b1 \u2192 K 0 S \u03c0 \u00b1 candidates in O NB sideband. The charged kaon detection asymmetry is measured using a clean large kaon sample from D 0 \u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212 decay, where the pion detection asymmetry in the decay is subtracted with pions from D + s \u2192 \u03c6\u03c0 + decays [41]. The raw asymmetries in B \u2192 K * \u03b3 are corrected with the measured charged kaon and pion detection asymmetries; \u22120.36 \u00b1 0.40%, \u22120.01 \u00b1 0.04% and +0.34 \u00b1 0.41% for K + \u03c0 \u2212 , K + \u03c0 0 and K 0 S \u03c0 + modes, respectively. The second largest is from fitter bias (0.07% to 0.16%) and the third largest is that due to the direct CP asymmetry in rare B meson decays, dominated by B \u2192 X s \u03b3, B \u2192 K * \u03b7 and B + \u2192 K * + \u03c0 0 (0.05% to 0.13%) [42].",
