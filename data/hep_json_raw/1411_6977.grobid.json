The experimental signature is a distinctive topology consisting of a pair of charged leptons originating from a displaced secondary vertex. Events corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.6 \u00f020.5\u00de fb \u22121 in the electron (muon) channel were collected with the CMS detector at the CERN LHC in proton-proton collisions at ffiffi ffi s p \u00bc 8 TeV. No significant excess is observed above standard model expectations. Upper limits on the product of the cross section and branching fraction of such a signal are presented as a function of the long-lived particle's mean proper decay length. The limits are presented in an approximately model-independent way, allowing them to be applied to a wide class of models yielding the above topology. Over much of the investigated parameter space, the limits obtained are the most stringent to date. In the specific case of a model in which a Higgs boson in the mass range 125-1000 GeV=c 2 decays into a pair of long-lived neutral bosons in the mass range 20-350 GeV=c 2 , each of which can then decay to dileptons, the upper limits obtained are typically in the range 0.2-10 fb for mean proper decay lengths of the long-lived particles in the range 0.01-100 cm. In the case of the lowest Higgs mass considered (125 GeV=c 2 ), the limits are in the range 2-50 fb. These limits are sensitive to Higgs boson branching fractions as low as 10 \u22124 .",

            "text": "In this paper we present an inclusive search for massive, long-lived exotic particles that decay to final states that include a pair of charged leptons using proton-proton (pp) collision data collected at ffiffi ffi s p \u00bc 8 TeV during 2012 with the compact muon solenoid (CMS) detector at the CERN LHC. Specifically, we search for events containing a pair of electrons or muons (dileptons) originating from a common secondary vertex within the volume of the CMS tracker, and with a significant transverse displacement from the event primary vertex. This topological signature has the potential to provide clear evidence for physics beyond the SM. Furthermore, it is almost free of background from SM processes. The search results are formally obtained within the context of two specific models; however, they are presented in an approximately model-independent way, allowing them to be applied to a wide range of models in which long-lived particles decay to final states that include dileptons. In the first model, the long-lived particle is a spinless boson X, which has a nonzero branching fraction to dileptons. The X is pair-produced in the decay of a non-SM Higgs boson, H \u2192 XX, X \u2192 l \u00fe l \u2212 [5], where the Higgs boson is produced through gluon-gluon fusion and l represents either an electron or a muon. In the second model, the long-lived particle is a neutralino\u03c7 0 which can decay via R-parity violating couplings into a neutrino and two charged leptons [2,6]. The neutralino is produced in events containing a pair of squarks, where a squark can decay via the processq \u2192 q\u03c7 0 ;\u03c7 0 \u2192 l \u00fe l \u2212 \u03bd. Both models predict up to two displaced dilepton vertices per event in the CMS tracker volume, of which we only require one to be found. In this paper, we will use \"LL particle\" to refer to any long-lived particle, such as the X or\u03c7 0 particle considered in our signal models.",

Improvements to the previous search include the higher integrated luminosity collected in 2012, which increases the sensitivity of the search, and an improved analysis strategy, which substantially broadens the range of signal models to which the analysis is sensitive. The analysis complements two recent CMS publications: one searching for events that contain one electron and one muon from LL particle decays [8], and another that searches for LL particles decaying to dijets [9]. The D0 Collaboration has published the results of a search for leptons from nonprompt decays in its tracker volume [10,11], performed at ffiffi ffi s p \u00bc 1.96 TeV at the Fermilab Tevatron. The ATLAS Collaboration has also performed related searches for long-lived particles using different decay channels [12,13], or lower-mass LL particles [14], compared to those considered in this paper.",

For example, if c\u03c4 is increased to 20 cm for this set of masses, then \u03f5 1 drops to 14% (20%) in the electron (muon) channel.

In contrast, for background events,v ll does not correspond to the flight direction of any long-lived particle, so its angular distribution with respect top ll should not show any forward-backward asymmetry. For example, in the case of Drell-Yan production of l \u00fe l \u2212 ,v ll is determined only by effects such as detector resolution or primary vertex misassignment. Although in the case of Drell-Yan production of \u03c4 \u00fe \u03c4 \u2212 , leptonic products of the \u03c4-lepton decays may have significant values of jd 0 j=\u03c3 d because of the nonzero lifetime of the \u03c4 lepton, a vertex reconstructed from two such leptons would not correspond to a genuine particle decay vertex. Processes such as nonprompt J=\u03c8 decay or \u03b3 conversions, which can give rise to genuine displaced dilepton vertices, are eliminated by the requirement on the minimum dilepton mass.

Both signal and background are expected to be equally divided between these two regions, so any significant asymmetry between them can only arise through systematic effects. We measure the size of this asymmetry by comparing the ratio of the number of events in the tail-cumulative distribution of jd 0 j=\u03c3 d in the region \u0394\u03a6 < 0 with that in the region \u0394\u03a6 > 0.

This suggests that misalignment should not be a significant effect at large jd 0 j=\u03c3 d . Nonetheless, to allow for the possibility that it might be, we employ the second approach; namely, when computing our final limits, we do so twice, once with the impact parameter corrections applied, and once without them, and then take the worse limits as our final result.

This difference does not show significant variation with respect to the transverse decay length of the LL particle. The material budget of the tracker is modeled in simulation to an accuracy of < 10% [24]. Since the amount of bremsstrahlung should be proportional to the amount of material in the tracker, this implies a corresponding relative uncertainty in the difference between the track reconstruction efficiencies for electrons and muons.

This is generally a good assumption except for dimuons separated by \u0394R < 0.2, which are excluded because the trigger is inefficient for closely spaced dimuons.

The less stringent limits for the muon channel in the m H \u00bc 1000 GeV=c 2 , m X \u00bc 20 GeV=c 2 case are caused by low trigger efficiency for nearby muons, and the consequent \u0394R requirement. The corresponding limits on \u03c3\u00f0qq \u00c3 \u00feqq\u00deB\u00f0q \u2192 q\u03c7 0 ; \u03c7 0 \u2192 l \u00fe l \u2212 \u03bd\u00de are shown in Fig. 6. The shaded band in each of these plots shows the AE1\u03c3 range of variation of the expected 95% C.L. limits, illustrated for one choice of masses. All the observed limits are consistent with the corresponding expected ones. At ffiffi ffi s p \u00bc 8 TeV, the theoretical cross sections for SM Higgs boson production through the dominant gluon-gluon fusion mechanism are 19.3, 7.1, 2.9, and 0.03 pb for Higgs boson masses of 125, 200, 400, and 1000 GeV=c 2 , respectively [30]. The theoretical cross sections forqq \u00c3 \u00fe qq production are 2590, 10, 0.014, and 0.00067 pb forq masses of 120, 350, 1000, and 1500 GeV=c 2 , as evaluated with the PROSPINO generator [31] assuming a gluino mass of 5 TeV=c 2 . The observed limits on \u03c3B are usually well below these theoretical cross sections, implying that nontrivial bounds are being placed on the decay modes involving LL particles, probing, for example, branching fractions as low as 10 \u22124 and 10 \u22126 in the Higgs and supersymmetric models, respectively. We also compute upper limits on the cross section times branching fraction within the acceptance A, where the latter is defined in the last paragraph of Sec. IV. Figures 7-8 show for the electron and muon channels, respectively, these limits on \u03c3\u00f0H \u2192 XX\u00deB\u00f0X \u2192 l \u00fe l \u2212 \u00deA\u00f0X \u2192 l \u00fe l \u2212 \u00de. .

Figure 9 shows the corresponding limits on \u03c3\u00f0qq \u00c3 \u00fe qq\u00deB\u00f0q \u2192 q\u03c7 0 ;\u03c7 0 \u2192 l \u00fe l \u2212 \u03bd\u00deA\u00f0q \u2192 q\u03c7 0 ;\u03c7 0 \u2192 l \u00fe l \u2212 \u03bd\u00de. These limits restricted to the acceptance region show substantially less dependence on the Higgs boson and X boson masses and on the mean proper decay length c\u03c4 of the X boson. They are also less model dependent, as can be seen by the fact that the limits on \u03c3BA are similar for X \u2192 l \u00fe l \u2212 and\u03c7 0 \u2192 l \u00fe l \u2212 \u03bd. The residual dependence of the limits on c\u03c4 is due to the jd 0 j=\u03c3 d > 12 requirement at small values of c\u03c4; whereas at larger values of c\u03c4, it is caused by the fact that, even within the defined acceptance region, the tracking efficiency falls for leptons produced far from the beam line with very large impact parameters.",

To place approximate limits on this more general class of models, one should use the limits within the acceptance region (i.e. on \u03c3BA), because of their smaller model dependence. In most signal models in which each event contains two identical LL particles that decay in this way, the limits on \u03c3BA shown in Figs. 7-9 should remain approximately valid. (The variation among the limit curves shown in these plots for different signal models and particle masses gives an indication of the accuracy of this statement.)

No such events have been seen. Quantitative limits have been placed on the product of the cross section and branching fraction of such a signal in the context of two specific models. In the first model, a Higgs boson, in the mass range 125-1000 GeV=c 2 , decays into a pair of hypothetical, long-lived neutral bosons in the mass range 20-350 GeV=c 2 , each of which can decay to dileptons. The upper limits obtained are typically in the range 0.2-10 fb for long-lived particles with mean proper decay lengths in the range 0.01-100 cm, and weaken to 250 fb for the lowest considered Higgs mass of 125 GeV=c 2 . In the second model, based on R-parity violating supersymmetry, a pair of squarks each decays to a quark and a long-lived neutralino\u03c7 0 ; the neutralino can subsequently decay to e \u00fe e \u2212 \u03bd or \u03bc \u00fe \u03bc \u2212 \u03bd. In this case, the upper limits are typically in the range 0.2-5 fb for\u03c7 0 mean proper decay lengths in the range 0.1-100 cm and squark masses above 350 GeV=c 2 . For a lower squark mass of 120 GeV=c 2 , the limits are typically a factor of ten weaker. These limits are sensitive to branching fractions as low as 10 \u22124 and 10 \u22126 in the Higgs boson and supersymmetric models, respectively. To allow the results to be reinterpreted in the context of other models, limits that are restricted to the detector acceptance are also presented, reducing the model dependence.
