It is based on a sample of pp collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb \u22121 . A high-purity sample of t-channel single top quark events with an isolated muon is selected. Signal and background components are estimated using a fit to data. A differential cross section measurement, corrected for detector effects, of an angular observable sensitive to the top quark polarisation is performed. The differential distribution is used to extract a top quark spin asymmetry of 0.26 \u00b1 0.03(stat) \u00b1 0.10(syst), which is compatible with a p-value of 4.6% with the standard model prediction of 0.44.",

Its lifetime (\u22484 \u00d7 10 \u221225 s) is much shorter than the typical timescales of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). It is therefore the only quark that decays through electroweak interactions before hadronising. Furthermore, the parity-violating nature of the V-A electroweak interaction at the Wtb vertex means that only left-handed quarks are expected at this vertex. Thus, top quark decay products retain memory of the top quark spin orientation in their angular distributions. This fact turns the top quark into a powerful probe of the structure of the electroweak Wtb vertex.",

However, new physics models could also lead to a depolarisation in production by altering the coupling structure [3][4][5][6].",

Single top quark t-channel events from Monte Carlo (MC) simulation are generated with the next-to-leading-order (NLO) MC generator powheg 1.0 [11][12][13], interfaced with pythia 6.4 [14] for the parton showering, in which \u03c4 lepton decays are modelled with tauola [15].

The powheg 1.0 generator interfaced with pythia 6 is also used to model the W-associated (tW) and s-channel single top quark background events. The tt, W boson in association with jets (W+jets), and Drell-Yan in association with jets (Z/\u03b3 * +jets) processes are generated with MadGraph 5.1 [20] interfaced with pythia 6. tauola is used to simulate \u03c4 lepton decays. Up to three (four) additional partons are generated at matrix-element (ME) level in tt (W+jets and Z/\u03b3 * +jets) events. A procedure, implemented during event generation, based on the so-called \"MLM prescription\" [21,22], avoids double counting jets generated simultaneously by the ME and by the parton shower (PS) simulations. An alternative sample of W+jets generated with sherpa 1.4.0 at NLO [23,24] is used to compare the modelling of this background. Diboson production (WW, WZ, ZZ) is simulated using pythia 6. Multijet events (i.e. events with the muon not originating from a leptonically decaying W or Z boson) are modelled using statistically independent samples in data, as detailed in section 6.1. Other special samples of signal and background are generated with different values for generator parameters (e.g. top quark mass, renormalisation and factorisation scales, etc.), and used to estimate the corresponding systematic uncertainties. All single top quark processes are normalised to approximate next-to-next-to-leadingorder (NNLO) predictions [25] (\u03c3 t-channel = 87.1 pb, \u03c3 s-channel = 5.55 pb, \u03c3 tW = 22.2 pb). Top quark pair production is normalised to a complete NNLO prediction in QCD that includes soft gluon resummation to next-to-next-to-leading-log order, as calculated with the Top++2.0 program [26] (\u03c3 tt = 252.9 pb). The W+jets and Z/\u03b3 * +jets production cross sections times branching fraction are calculated at NNLO with fewz [27] (\u03c3 W+jets B(W \u2192 \u03bd) = 37 509 pb, and \u03c3 Z/\u03b3 * +jets B(Z/\u03b3 * \u2192 + \u2212 ) = 3504 pb at a generator-level threshold of m + \u2212 > 50 GeV, where = e, \u00b5, or \u03c4). The diboson cross sections are calculated at NLO with mcfm 5.8 [28] (\u03c3 WW = 54.8 pb, \u03c3 WZ = 33.2 pb, and \u03c3 ZZ = 8.1 pb).",
