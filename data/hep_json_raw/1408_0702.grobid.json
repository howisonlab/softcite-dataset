            "text": "Heavy-ion collisions are expected to produce sufficiently high energy densities to form a deconfined state of quarks and gluons, referred to as Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). One of the signatures of its formation is the so-called \"J/\u03c8 melting\" predicted by Matsui and Satz [6], which results in a suppression of J/\u03c8 production. However in heavyion collisions, the effects related to CNM should also be considered in order to correctly interpret the Pb-Pb results. In order to disentangle hot (related to the QGP formation) and CNM effects in heavy-ion collisions, the latter should be quantified precisely. This can be done by studying the nucleon-nucleus collisions where CNM effects play the main role. The CNM effects are usually classified into three groups, depending on the time when they take place, with respect to the time of the cc pair formation: initial state effects, final state effects and coherent parton energy loss. Initial state effects occur before the cc pair formation (e.g. gluon shadowing [4,5,7] or saturation [8]). Final state effects occur after the cc pair production (e.g. nuclear absorption of J/\u03c8 pre-resonant state). Coherent parton energy loss is neither a pure initial nor a final state effect since it arises from an effect of the interference between gluons radiated by the incoming partons and the cc pair propagating through the nuclear medium.",

The effects are expected to be larger in the most central than in the most peripheral collisions. The latter are expected to be very similar to pp collisions. The collision centrality is determined experimentally in p-Pb collisions thanks to a Monte-Carlo (MC) generator based on the Glauber model [12,13] that is fitted to the charged-particle multiplicity measurements. The energy measurement of the spectator nucleons can also be associated to a MC generator based on the Slow Nucleon Model (SNM) [14]. Due to the bias, discussed below, in the centrality determination, the results depend on the centrality estimator. Therefore, we will use the words \"event activity\" instead of \"centrality\".",

            "text": "ALICE [15] is one of the four large experiments at the LHC. It is dedicated to the study of QGP properties in heavyion collisions. J/\u03c8 production can be measured down to zero transverse momentum p T in two dilepton decay channels: dimuon at forward and dielectron at mid-rapidity. This analysis is based on the dimuon decay channel measured by the ALICE muon spectrometer in \u22124 < \u03b7 < \u22122.5. Due to the beam-energy asymmetry, the nucleon-nucleon center-ofmass (cms) system is shifted with respect to the laboratory frame towards the proton beam direction by \u2206y = 0.465. The data were taken with two beam configurations, obtained by inverting the proton and lead beam directions. In the muon spectrometer two rapidity ranges have then been investigated: the backward (\u22124.46 < y cms < \u22122.96) and the forward (2.03 < y cms < 3.53) rapidity. The minimum bias (MB) trigger was defined as the coincidence in the signal of the two scintillator hodoscopes (VZERO) located at both sides of the interaction point. The dimuon trigger used for this analysis, required a coincidence of the MB collision with two opposite-sign muon tracks triggered by the muon trigger chambers. These dimuons are required to have a rapidity 2.5 < y \u00b5\u00b5 lab < 4 constrained by the muon spectrometer acceptance. The requirement \u22124 < \u03b7 \u00b5 < \u22122.5 is used to reject single muons at the edge of the acceptance of the spectrometer. To remove tracks crossing the thicker part of the absorber an additional cut was made on R abs , the radial transverse position of the muon tracks at the end of the absorber: 17.6 < R abs < 89.5 cm. ALICE measures the inclusive J/\u03c8 production while typically the theoretical models deal with prompt J/\u03c8. The fraction of J/\u03c8 from B decays in the inclusive sample in p-Pb is similar to that in pp collisions (\u223c10%) [10]. This effect is well below the quoted experimental uncertainties (>10%). Thus, the ALICE results can be safely compared to theoretical predictions [9].",

In this analysis, the neutron energy distributions in the Zero Degree Calorimeters (ZDC), installed at 112.5 m from the interaction point, were used for the centrality determination since they are less sensitive to this dynamical bias [16]. The event activity classes are then determined from the fit to the ZDC neutron (ZN) energy distribution.

At backward y, Q mult pPb is consistent with unity for the full event activity range. At forward y the suppression of J/\u03c8 production increases with the event activity up to 45%. In Fig. 3 the p T dependence of Q mult pPb is shown for large (5- 10%, left) and small (80-100%, right) event activity. At large event activity Q mult pPb increases with p T both at backward and forward y. At backward y it is higher than 1 and reaches 1.45 at p T = 7 GeV/c. It is qualitatively described by the predictions from [2]. At small event activity Q mult pPb is consistent with unity for both backward and forward y in the full p T range.

J/\u03c8 production has a harder p T distribution at forward than at backward y. At small event activity (80-100%) at backward y, p 2 T J/\u03c8 pPb \u2248 p 2 T J/\u03c8 pp . According to this estimator, at small event activity no nuclear effects are seen while at large event activity they are large: Q mult pPb 1.45 at p T \u223c 7 GeV/c at backward y and Q mult pPb 0.55 at p T 1 GeV/c at forward y. The ratio of forward and backward y results also changes dramatically with the event activity: for low p T 1 GeV/c it changes from 0.54 to about 0.95 when going from large to small event activity. A quantitative comparison with theoretical models is needed for a better interpretation of these results.",
