The results are based on data collected by the COMPASS Collaboration at CERN using muon beam energies of 160 GeV and 200 GeV. The statistical precision is more than tenfold better than that of the previous measurement in this region. In the whole range of x, the measured values of A p 1 and g p 1 are found to be positive. It is for the first time that spin effects are found at such low values of x.",

Precise measurements of g p 1 (x, Q 2 ) were realised in the deep inelastic regime of charged lepton nucleon scattering at photon virtualities Q 2 > 1 (GeV/c) 2  [1,2] over a wide range of the Bjorken scaling variable x. On the contrary, the behaviour of g p 1 at lower Q 2 is largely unknown. For fixed-target experiments, the values of Q 2 1 (GeV/c) 2 imply small values of x. This low-Q 2 region is governed by 'soft' processes and the transition to the region of higher Q 2 is still not understood.",

For lower values of Q 2 , soft interactions become relevant and 'nonperturbative' mechanisms dominate the reaction dynamics. In order to provide a suitable description of the non-perturbative region and also of the transition region between 'soft' and 'hard' physics, it is tried in phenomenological calculations to extrapolate ideas based on the parton model to the low-Q 2 region and add mechanisms like (generalised) vector meson dominance, (G)VMD, supplemented by the Regge model (see Refs. [3][4][5][6]). New and precise data on g p 1 (x, Q 2 ) in the low-Q 2 region are hence essential to improve and validate such calculations.",

Neighbouring cells were polarised in opposite directions in order to use both target polarisations simultaneously during data taking. The polarisation directions were inverted on a regular basis by rotating the direction of the target magnetic field, thus compensating for acceptance differences between different cells and thereby minimising possible systematic effects. Once per year the direction of the polarisation with respect to the solenoid field was reverted by repolarisation in opposite direction keeping the solenoid field unchanged.

Within the large statistical uncertainties, their results are consistent with our present results, but also with zero. Compared to the results from SMC, which is the only other experiment that covers the low-x region, we improve the statistics by a factor of about 150. In Fig. 3 (right), the \u03bd-dependence of A p 1 is shown. A rather flat distribution is measured, apart from a slight enhancement for \u03bd < 50 GeV that corresponds to higher values of Q 2 . In Fig. 4, the results for A  160 GeV and 200 GeV are consistent in the overlapping Q 2 region. From the figure, no conclusion on a possible Q 2 dependence can be drawn.",

The numerical values for A p 1 and g p 1 versus x, averaged over Q 2 , are given together with their statistical and systematic uncertainites in Table A.1 of the appendix for the two energies separately. The data for the two energies were combined and false asymmetries reevaluated for the merged data. The values for the combined results are given in Table A.2. In Fig. 7, the present results on g p 1 are compared with the predictions of the phenomenological models of Refs. [5,6]. The first model (BKZ) is based on GVMD ideas supplemented by the Regge formalism. The contribution of heavy vector mesons to g p 1 was treated as an extrapolation of the QCD improved parton model to arbitrarily low values of Q 2 . The magnitude of the light vector meson contribution was fixed in the photoproduction limit by relating the first moment of g p 1 to the static properties of the proton via the Drell-Hearn-Gerasimov sum rule [23], using the measurements in the region of baryonic resonances [24]. For more details, see Ref. [5] and references therein. In these models, both perturbative and non-perturbative contributions to g p 1 are found to be present at all values of Q 2 . Reasonable agreement is observed between the BKZ model and our measurements in all four two-dimensional grids of kinematic variables. Fig. 7 (left) shows a comparison of the x dependence of the BKZ model prediction with the results for g p 1 obtained combining the 160 GeV and 200 GeV results.",

The curve shows results of the g p 1 calculations of BKZ [5], where for the parameterisation of the perturbative part of g p 1 the DSSV [25] parton distributions at NLO accuracy are used. Right: Comparison of the x dependence of g p 1 at 160 GeV (open symbols) and 200 GeV (closed symbols) with the results of the calculations of ZR [6] at 160 and 200 GeV incident energy (solid and dotted lines). Error bars represent statistical and bands systematic uncertainties.0.006 (GeV/c) 2 < Q 2 < 1 (GeV/c) 2 and 4 \u00d7 10 \u22125 < x < 4 \u00d7 10 \u22122 ,these results improve the statistical precision by a factor of more than 10 compared to existing measurements.The values of Ap 1 (x) and g p 1 (x) are found to be positive over the whole measured range of x, with a value of about 0.01 for the spin asymmetry for x < 10 \u22123 . While the earlier results obtained using a deuteron target were found to be consistent with zero, the present measurement shows for the first time non-zero spin effects at such small values of x. The data are compared to two phenomenological models of g p 1 valid in the region of low x and low Q 2 [5,6], for which vector meson dominance and ideas based on the parton model are used to extrapolate the structure function g p 1to low values of Q 2 . These models describe the general trend in the data over the whole Q 2 range of the data.",
