The measurement is based on data collected using the ATLAS detector at the LHC in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV with an integrated luminosity of 4.6 fb \u22121 . Distributions of the charged particle multiplicity and of the charged particle transverse momentum are measured in regions of azimuthal angle defined with respect to the Z -boson direction. The measured distributions are compared to similar distributions measured in jet events, and to the predictions of various Monte Carlo generators implementing different underlying event models.",

This includes partons not participating in the hard-scattering process (beam remnants), and additional hard scatters in the same proton-proton collision, termed multiple parton interactions (MPI). Initial and final state gluon radiation (ISR, FSR) also contribute to the UE activity. It is impossible to unambiguously separate the UE from the hard scattering process on an event-by-event basis. However, distributions can be measured that are sensitive to the properties of the UE.",

The full dataset acquired during 2011 is used, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 4.64 \u00b1 0.08 fb \u22121 . Events with a Z -boson candidate decaying into an electron or muon pair were selected, and observables constructed from the final state charged particles (after excluding the lepton pair) were studied as a function of the transverse momentum 1 of the Z -boson candidate, p Z T . This paper is organised as follows: the definitions of the underlying event observables are given in Sect. 2. The ATLAS detector is described in Sect. 3. In Sect. 4, the MC models used in this analysis are discussed. Sections 5 and 6 describe the event selection, and the correction for the effect of multiple proton-proton interactions in the same bunch crossing (termed pile-up). The correction of the data to the particle level, and the combination of the electron and muon channel results are described in Sect. 7. Section 8 contains the estimation of the systematic uncertainties. The results are discussed in Sect. 9 and finally the conclusions are presented in Sect. 10.",

The away region is dominated by particles balancing the momentum of the Z -boson except at low values of p Z T . The transverse region is sensitive to the underlying event, since it is by construction perpendicular to the direction of the Z -boson and hence it is expected to have a lower level of activity from the hard scattering process compared to the away region. The two opposite transverse regions may be distinguished on an event-by-event basis through their amount of activity, as measured by the sum of the charged-particle transverse momenta in each of them. The more or less-active transverse regions are then referred to as trans-max and trans-min, respectively, with the difference between them on an event-by-event basis for a given observable defined as trans-diff [13,14]. The activity in the toward region, which is similarly unaffected by additional activity from the hard scatter, is measured in this analysis, in contrast to the underlying event analysis in dijet events [5].",

In scattering processes modelled by lowest-order perturbative QCD two-to-two parton scatters, with a sufficiently low p T threshold, the partonic jet cross-section exceeds that of the total hadronic cross-section. This can be interpreted in terms of MPI. In this picture, the ratio of the partonic jet cross-section to the total crosssection is interpreted as the mean number of parton interactions per event. This is implemented using phenomenological models [24], which include (non-exhaustively) further low-p T screening of the partonic differential cross-section, and use of phenomenological transverse matter-density profiles inside the hadrons. The connection of colour lines between partons, and the rearrangement of the colour structure of an event by reconnection of the colour strings, are implemented in different ways in these phenomenological models.",

A related matching process is used to interface Pythia 6 to the next-to-leading-order (NLO) Powheg generator, where the matching scheme avoids both doublecounting and NLO subtraction singularities [27,28].

In each event, the pile-up contribution to a given observable is derived from tracks selected with the same longitudinal and transverse impact parameter requirements as the PV tracks, but with respect to two points located at z distances of +2 cm and \u22122 cm from the hard-scattering PV. The shift of 2 cm relative to the PV introduces a bias in the density of the pile-up interactions. This is corrected on the basis of the shape of the distribution of the z distance between pairs of interactions in the same bunch crossing. This distribution is well approximated by a Gaussian with variance \u03c3 = \u221a 2\u03c3 BS , where \u03c3 BS \u2248 6 cm is the effective longitudinal variance of the interaction region averaged over all events.

This bias is observed at high p Z T , mostly in the toward region and to a lesser extent in the transverse region, and affects the p T distribution for high values of p T , typically p T > 30 GeV. It arises from the imperfect modelling of the electron shower shape variables in the simulation, which leads to an underestimate of the electron identification efficiency for electrons close to jets. The bias on the observable can be as large as 50 % for p T = 100 GeV. Since it is not reproduced precisely enough by the simulation of the electron shower, in the relevant narrow regions of phase space a tightened isolationcriterion was applied to electrons to exclude the mismodelled event configurations and the proper geometric correction was deduced from the muon channel unaffected by jet overlap. The combined results for electrons and muons in the affected bins are assigned a larger uncertainty, since the contribution of events from the electron-decay channel is significantly reduced leading to a larger overall uncertainty.

Combining the dressed electron and muon pairs induces < 0.1 % additional systematic uncertainty on the UE observables compared to the Born level results.

Assuming the same flat UE activity in trans-min and trans-max regions, the trans-diff region, the difference between the observables measured in trans-max and transmin regions, is expected to be dominated by the hard scattering component. In Sect. 9.3 profile histograms are shown. Finally, in Sect. 9.4, the results are compared to previous measurements from ATLAS where distributions sensitive to the underlying event were measured as a function of the kinematics of either the leading charged particle [1], or the leading jet [5].  Fig. 6. At values below p T /\u03b4\u03b7 \u03b4\u03c6 of 0.1 GeV, the distributions exhibit a decrease, which is independent of p Z T . This is followed by a sharp increase at higher p T /\u03b4\u03b7 \u03b4\u03c6, which is an artifact of requiring at least two tracks with p T of at least 0.5 GeV in every event. Then a broad distribution can be seen extending to p T /\u03b4\u03b7 \u03b4\u03c6 of about 1 GeV, followed [GeV] T interval. For lower p Z T values, the decrease is faster. These features are fairly independent of the UE regions, with the exception of the trans-min region, in which the p T /\u03b4\u03b7 \u03b4\u03c6 distribution is approximately independent of p Z T up to p T /\u03b4\u03b7 \u03b4\u03c6 of 1 GeV.

Nevertheless, certain common qualita-  tive features can be observed by comparing p T /\u03b4\u03b7 \u03b4\u03c6 and N ch /\u03b4\u03b7 \u03b4\u03c6 as functions of the leading object p T in the transverse region, and also separated into the transmax/min regions as shown in Figs. 24 and 25. The measurements with a leading jet are complementary to the measurements with a leading track, and a smooth continuation at 20 GeV is observed (in Fig. 24), corresponding to the lowest jet p T for which the jet measurement could be performed and the highest leading track momentum included in the leading track analysis. Where the p T of the leading object is less than 50 GeV, a large difference is observed both for the N ch and p T average values between the jet and Z -boson measurements in Fig. 24; the increase Although the N ch density is similar in the underlying event associated with a jet to that with a Z -boson for higher values of the hard scale (\u226550 GeV), there are residual differences in the average p T densities. The activity in events with a Z -boson is systematically higher than that in events with jets. From the behaviour of the underlying event properties in the trans-max/min regions in Fig. 25, this difference originates mostly from the trans-max region, due to selection bias discussed previously in this section. The trans-min region is very similar between the two measurements, despite the different hard scales, indicating again that this region is least sensitive to the hard interaction and most sensitive to the MPI component.

The transverse and toward regions with respect to the reconstructed Z -boson are most sensitive to the underlying event. The transverse region was further subdivided into trans-max and trans-min regions on an event-by-event basis depending on which one had a higher p T ; this subdivision provides additional power to discriminate between the different processes contributing to the underlying event models.",

The insets show the region of transition between the leading charged particle and leading jet results in more detail is observed in all the investigated regions, with the transmin region least affected by it. The average underlying event activity increases with p Z T , until it reaches a plateau, which is again most prominent in the trans-min region. The results have been compared to a number of MC models, using several tunes of commonly used underlying event models. MC model predictions qualitatively describe the data well, but with some significant discrepancies, providing precise information sensitive to the choices of parameters used in the various underlying-event models. Careful tuning of these parameters in the future may improve the description of the data by the different models in future LHC measurements and studies. The study of such variables in Z -boson events provides a probe of the underlying event which is complementary to that from purely hadronic events. A comparison between them shows similar underlying event activity for the transmin region. dation, Germany; GSRT and NSRF, Greece; ISF, MINERVA, GIF, I-CORE and Benoziyo Center, Israel; INFN, Italy; MEXT and JSPS, Japan; CNRST, Morocco; FOM and NWO, Netherlands; BRF and RCN, Norway; MNiSW and NCN, Poland; GRICES and FCT, Portugal; MNE/IFA, Romania; MES of Russia and ROSATOM, Russian Federation; JINR; MSTD, Serbia; MSSR, Slovakia; ARRS and MIZ\u0160, Slovenia; DST/NRF, South Africa; MINECO, Spain; SRC and Wallenberg Foundation, Sweden; SER, SNSF and Cantons of Bern and Geneva, Switzerland; NSC, Taiwan; TAEK, Turkey; STFC, the Royal Society and Leverhulme Trust, United Kingdom; DOE and NSF, United States of America.
