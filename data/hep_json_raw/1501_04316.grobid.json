K \u00b1 K \u00b1 correlation functions are studied for three transverse pair momentum, k T , ranges and parameterized by a Gaussian form. The emission source radii, R, and the correlation strength, \u03bb, are extracted. The analysis shows a decrease of the source radii with increasing kaon transverse pair momentum for all beam types.",

            "text": "In this paper we present results from K \u00b1 K \u00b1 correlation femtoscopy study in 600 GeV/c \u03a3 \u2212 C(Cu), \u03c0 \u2212 C(Cu) and 540 GeV/c pC(Cu) interactions from the SE-LEX (E781) experiment [1] at the Fermilab Tevatron. The correlation femtoscopy method allows to study spatio-temporal characteristics of the emission source at the level of 1 fm = 10 \u221215 m. The method is based on the Bose-Einstein enhancement of identical boson production at small relative momentum. The quantum statistics correlations were first observed as an enhanced production of the identical pion pairs with small opening angles in proton-antiproton collisions [2]. In 1960 this enhancement was explained by the symmetrization of the two-particle wave function by G. Goldhaber, S. Goldhaber, W.-Y. Lee, and A. Pais (GGLP effect) [3]. Later, in the 1970s, Kopylov and Podgoretsky suggested studying the interference effect in terms of the correlation function. They proposed the mixing technique to construct the uncorrelated reference sample, and clarified the role of the space-time characteristics of particle production [4][5][6]. Subsequently, two-particle correlations at small relative momentum were systematically studied for lepton-lepton [7], lepton-hadron [8], hadron-hadron [9], and heavy-ion [10,11] collisions. It was found that the system created in heavy-ion collisions undergoes the collective expansion and may be described by relativistic fluid dynamics [12][13][14][15]. By using the width of the quantum statistical enhancement, one can measure the radii R of the emitting source. The decrease of the extracted radii with increasing transverse pair momentum may be interpreted as the decrease of the \"homogeneity lengths\" [16] due to collective transverse flow.",

Each of the detectors has a hit detection efficiency greater than 98%. Transverse vertex position resolution (\u03c3) was 4 \u00b5m for the 600 GeV/c beam tracks. The average longitudinal vertex position resolution was 270 \u00b5m for primary vertex and 560 \u00b5m for secondary vertex. The detector geometry covers the forward 150 mrad cone. The particle momentum was measured by deflection of the track position by two magnets M1 and M2 in a system of proportional wire chambers and silicon strip detectors. Momentum resolution of a typical 100 GeV/c track was \u03c3 p /p \u2248 0.5%. A Ring Imaging Cherenkov detector (RICH) performed particle identification in a wide momentum range and provided 2 \u03c3 K/\u03c0 separation up to 165 GeV/c and single track ring radius resolution of 1.4% [21]. The kaon identification efficiency was over 90% above the kaon threshold (\u224843 GeV/c). The average number of tracks reaching the RICH was about 5 per event [22].

In order to reduce the contamination of secondary particles, it was required that the extrapolated track distance to the primary vertex was less than 15 \u00b5m in the transverse plane. Only tracks that matched the RICH detector were used in the analysis. Charged kaons were identified with the likelihood to be a kaon at least three times exceeding any other particle hypothesis. Fig. 1(a) shows the single kaon purity as a function of the momentum for the \u03a3 \u2212 , \u03c0 \u2212 and p beams. It is defined as the fraction of the accepted kaon tracks that correspond to true kaon particles. The single particle purity was estimated from the RICH ring radius distributions of the data and by studying PYTHIA [23] simulations with the particle embedding through the detector. The main contamination for charged kaons in the momentum range p > 120 GeV/c comes from pions, because of the close ring radii in the RICH detector. The electrons were eliminated from the analysis using the transition radiation detector (ETRD) that was placed before RICH. The contamination from other particle species in the studied momentum range is negligible. Fig. 1(b) shows the charged kaon pair purity as a function of the average transverse momentum of the pair obtained for the \u03a3 \u2212 , \u03c0 \u2212 and p beams. The K \u00b1 pair purity is calculated as a product of two single-particle purities using the experimental momentum distributions.",
