By selecting specific decay channels, such as \u03c8(3686) \u2192 pp\u03c0 0 , N * intermediate resonances coupling to p\u03c0 0 orp\u03c0 0 can be studied. Here, \u2206 resonances are suppressed due to isospin conservation. As a consequence, the reduced number of states greatly facilitates the analysis [12]. N * production in J/\u03c8 \u2192 pp\u03b7 was studied using partial wave analysis at BES [13], and two N * resonances were observed. In a recent analysis of J/\u03c8 \u2192 pn\u03c0 \u2212 +c.c. [14], a new N * resonance around 2000 MeV/c 2 named N (2065) was observed. This N (2065) was also observed in the decay of J/\u03c8 \u2192 pp\u03c0 0 [15]. The production of N (2065) in J/\u03c8 decays occurs close to the edge of the phase space. Thus, a similar search for this resonance in the \u03c8(3686) decays should provide further insight.",

In the second method, the background contribution is estimated using the \u03c0 0 sideband events, defined by 30 MeV/c 2 < |M \u03b3\u03b3 \u2212 135| < 45 MeV/c 2 .

This has been studied using 42 pb \u22121 of continuum data at \u221a s = 3650 MeV. After normalizing to the integrated luminosity of \u03c8(3686), 447 background events are found.

The reason is two-fold. At first, the annihilation radius of cc is very small, estimated to be in the order of 0.1 fm, due to the large mass of charm quark. This is about one order of magnitude smaller than the interaction radius of \u03c0N scattering which is about several fm. Secondly, the relative momentum of N * andp is small, especially for large mass N * resonance. Given the small annihilation radius and the small relative momenta of N * andN , orbital angular momenta L>2 should be suppressed. If otherwise high spin states do exist in this decay, this should result in an inconsistency of data and fit, which is not observed. Thus, with the sensitivity of the present experiment, we consider it adequate to include only states with spin up to 5/2.",
