From these distributions, we define X \u03bc max as the depth along the shower axis where the production of muons reaches maximum.

Although the first indications of their existence were obtained more than fifty years ago [1], many of their properties remain mysterious [2]. To answer the question of the origin of ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) requires three experimental feats: finding the mass of the primary particles, measuring the energy spectrum, and measuring the distribution of arrival directions. The energy spectrum is the best known of the three, and its main features are well established [3,4].",

The depth of the shower maximum X max is sensitive to the nature of the primary particles [5][6][7]. It also helps to provide insight on whether new physics phenomena take place at these extreme energies. The measurements of X max performed by the Pierre Auger and HiRes/TA collaborations cannot be compared directly because of the different detector acceptances and the different X max analysis approaches. However, when interpreted in terms of composition, the Pierre Auger Collaboration claims evidence of a light composition at energies around 3 EeVand a gradual increase of the average mass of cosmic rays towards higher energies [8], while the HiRes/TA collaborations cannot currently discriminate between a proton-dominated composition and a changing composition (such as suggested by Auger), due to statistical limitations [9].",

            "text": "X max measurements suffer from low statistics due to the small duty cycle of fluorescence detectors (less than 15%) and the stringent cuts imposed to avoid a biased data sample. Therefore, to gain additional insight on questions like mass composition or whether new hadronic interactions are taking place, we need independent measurements with larger statistics, a different set of systematic uncertainties, and the possibility of reaching higher energies. To infer the mass of the primary, we can study the longitudinal development of the muonic component of extensive air showers (EASs) [10], thus taking advantage of the large statistical sample provided by the Auger surface detector (SD) array. The SD array delivers this information through the timing records associated with the muons that reach the ground. The arrival times of the muons allow the reconstruction of their geometrical production heights along the shower axis. It is thus possible to reconstruct a distribution of muon production depths (MPD). Since muons come from the decay of pions and kaons, the shape of the MPD distribution contains information about the evolution of the hadronic cascade. This information renders the study of MPD interesting for two reasons: on the one hand, we know that different primaries have distinct hadronic properties that translate into variations of their respective longitudinal profiles. Therefore, it is natural to think that the MPD distribution must be sensitive to the mass of primary particles. On the other hand, the MPD distribution might be an optimal tool to study hadronic interactions at ultrahigh energies, since the longitudinal development is dependent on the hadronic interaction properties. MPD distributions can help in understanding whether a departure from standard physics is the source of the substantial differences observed between data and the current models used for shower simulations [11]. In this * auger_spokespersons@fnal.gov work, we explore the possibility of using MPD distributions as an experimental observable sensitive to the mass of the primary cosmic rays and able to constrain high-energy interaction models. The Auger Collaboration is currently evaluating other methods based on surface detector data [12] that could add valuable information to the set of parameters sensitive to mass composition.",

Two detection methods are used to obtain information about EASs, and hence information on the primary cosmic rays that create them. The SD array is comprised of 1660 cylindrical water Cherenkov detectors arranged on a triangular grid, with 1500 m spacing, that covers an area of over 3000 km 2 . Each detector has a 10 m 2 surface area and 1.2 m water depth, the water volume being viewed by three 9 inch photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) [13,14]. PMT signals are digitized using 40 MHz, 10 bit flash analog-to-digital converters (FADCs). The detectors respond to the muons, photons, and electrons of air showers and are calibrated in units of the signal produced by a muon traversing the water vertically, known as a vertical equivalent muon or VEM [15]. The fluorescence detector (FD) consists of 27 optical telescopes overlooking the SD array [16,17]. On clear moonless nights these are used to observe the longitudinal development of showers by detecting the fluorescence and Cherenkov light produced in the atmosphere by charged particles along the shower trajectory. In the context of primary mass studies, hybrid events have been used to provide a direct measurement of X max [7].",

Only brief details of the reconstruction methods are given here. More extended descriptions of detectors and of reconstruction procedures can be found in Refs. [4,7,13]. The trigger requirement for the surface array to form an event is based on a threefold coincidence, satisfied when a triangle of neighboring stations is triggered locally [18]. For the present analysis, we use events that satisfy a fiducial cut to ensure adequate containment inside the array. For events whose reconstructed energy is above 3 EeV, the efficiency of detection is 100%. For SD data, the arrival directions are obtained from the times at which the shower front passes through the triggered detectors, this time being measured using GPS information. The angular resolution, defined as the angular radius around the true cosmic-ray direction that would contain 68% of the reconstructed shower directions, is 0.8\u00b0for energies above 3 EeV [19]. The estimator of the primary energy of events recorded by the SD array is the reconstructed signal at 1000 m from the shower core, S\u00f01000\u00de. The conversion from this estimator to energy is derived experimentally through the use of a subset of showers that trigger the FD and the SD simultaneously (hybrid events). The energy resolution above 10 EeV is about 12%. The absolute energy scale, determined by the FD, has a systematic uncertainty of 14% [20].",

Unlike the electromagnetic component of the shower, muon trajectories can be taken as straight lines, due to the lesser importance of bremsstrahlung and multiple scattering effects. This fact confers the muons a distinctive attribute: they retain a memory of their production points. The muon component reaching the ground has a time structure caused by the convolution of production spectra, energy loss, and decay probability during propagation. Thanks to a set of simple assumptions [21], these arrival times can be used to obtain the distribution of muon production distances along the shower axis. Since muons are the products of pion and kaon decays, the distribution of muon production distances provides information about the longitudinal development of the hadronic component of the EAS [22]. This information is complementary to that obtained from the electromagnetic component through the detection of atmospheric fluorescence light.",

This is outlined in Fig. 1, where muons are produced at the position z along the shower axis and, after traveling a FIG. 1. Geometry used to obtain the muon traveled distance and the time delay. distance l, they reach the ground at the point defined by \u00f0r; \u03b6\u00de. r and \u03b6 are measured in the shower reference frame and represent the distance and the azimuthal position of the point at the ground, respectively. \u0394 is the distance from the ground impact point to the shower plane. Referencing the muon time of flight to the arrival time of the showerfront plane for each position (r; \u03b6), we obtain what we define as the geometric delay, t g . It represents the delay of muons due to the deviation of their trajectories with respect to the direction of the shower axis. Given t g , it is possible to derive the production distance z of muons for each position (r; \u03b6) at the ground.",

The average energy of muons at production (v \u03bc < c) and their energy loss, mainly because of inelastic collisions with atomic electrons in the air, cause a kinematic delay t \u03b5 , with respect to a particle traveling at the speed of light. To compute it, we need an estimation of the energy carried by each single muon. The Auger SD array does not allow for such a measurement: therefore we must use for this correction a mean kinematic time value ht \u03b5 i as an approximation [24]. An additional source of delay is given by the deflection of muons due to their elastic scattering off nuclei. Furthermore, the geomagnetic field affects the trajectory of the muons, delaying their arrival times even more. The longer the path of the muon, the larger is the effect; hence, it is especially important for very inclined events.",

All contributing effects show a clear dependence with r. This behavior is similar for events with different zenith angles. The geometric delay dominates at large distances. The contribution of the kinematic effect is larger near the core. In principle, one may think that the kinematic delay decreases closer to the core because muons are more energetic on average. However, in this region the spread in energy is larger [25], and the mean time delay is dominated by low-energy muons. For events at \u223c60\u00b0, at distances r > 1000 m, the kinematic delay typically amounts to less than 30% of the total delay, while the rest of the contributions are of the order of a few percent (see Fig. 2).",

            "text": "The MPD is reconstructed from the FADC signals obtained with the water Cherenkov detectors. The finite area of the detectors induces fluctuations due to different muon samples being collected. In addition, the shape of the MPD distribution observed from different positions at the ground varies because of differences in the probability of in-flight decay and because muons are not produced isotropically from the shower axis. It is an integration over r which enables estimation of the dN \u03bc =dX distribution or MPD distribution (where N \u03bc refers to the number of produced muons). However, for discrete detector arrays, measurements at just a handful of r values are available and are limited to the small number of muons due to the finite collection surface (10 m 2 cross section for vertical incidence). Another important feature of the MPD distribution observed at the ground is its dependence on the zenith angle. There are two reasons for this. The first one is due to the fact that inclined events mostly evolve in a less dense atmosphere than more vertical ones. This makes pions reach their critical energies (\u03f5 \u03c0 c ) earlier, resulting in a shallower development of the shower. While the shapes of the muon distributions at production are almost unaffected by this difference in reaching \u03f5 \u03c0 c [25], their production depths are shifted. For proton showers at 10 19 eV, the difference between the distribution of maxima for vertical and 60\u00b0events is approximately 20 g=cm 2 . The second and main reason for the zenith angle dependence of the MPD distribution is a consequence of the muon decay probability. This effect influences not only the location of the maximum but also the shape of the observed MPD distribution. Figure 3 demonstrates this dependence for MPDs extracted from simulations at different zenith angles and at different distances r from the core. For zenith angles about 40\u00b0and lower, the shape of the MPD and the position of its maximum are a function of r. However, at zenith angles around 60\u00b0and above, the differences between the MPD distributions reconstructed at different distances to the core are small. At such angles, large z values dominate, diminishing the dependence of the traveled muon distance l on r.",

We have observed that a shift of 10 g=cm 2 in X 0 translates into a variation of 1.5 g=cm 2 in the value of X \u03bc max . As the mean difference in the X 0 values for proton and iron primaries is about 30 g=cm 2 , a maximum bias of \u223c3 g=cm 2 is expected.

From a sample of simulated proton and iron showers with 30 EeV of energy, we observe that the distribution of X \u03bc max varies as a function of the mass of the particle that initiates the atmospheric cascade (see Fig. 4). For heavier particles, the average value of X \u03bc max is smaller and the distribution is narrower compared with that of lighter particles. The same behavior is observed when considering different energies for the primary particle.

However, the reconstruction efficiency improves with energy, since the number of muons becomes larger as energy increases. Since the number of muons at the ground level is a function of the mass of the primary particle, in our selection we risk introduction of a bias towards heavier nuclei, if the value for r cut is not carefully chosen. Therefore, the selection of r cut must be a tradeoff between the resolution of the reconstructed MPD distribution and the selection bias [29].

In such a case, the expected resolution improves when the number of muons is augmented in simulated events. As discussed above, the number of muons is the largest contribution to the measured resolution. However, if the muon number is not only scaled up, but the muon energy spectrum is also modified [32], then the kinematic delay needs reevaluation.

According to simulations, the correlation factor between these two observables is \u2265 0.8. Therefore, similarly to X max , X \u03bc max is correlated with the mass of the incident cosmic ray particle. We can thus convert both observables into hln Ai using the same interaction model [8,37]. Figure 9 shows the outcome of this conversion for two different hadronic models. For EPOS-LHC the results indicate primaries heavier than iron (ln A Fe \u2243 4). The mean ln A values extracted from the measurements of X max and X \u03bc max are incompatible at a level of at least 2.5\u03c3. EPOS-LHC in combination with FLUKA 2011.2b.4 as a low-energy interaction model does not offer a consistent description of the electromagnetic and muonic components of the EAS. With QGSJETII-04/FLUKA, we obtain compatible values for ln A, but it should be noted that, in contrast to EPOS-LHC , this model has problems to describe in a consistent way the first two moments of the ln A distribution obtained from the X max measurements done with the FD [8]. We conclude from the comparisons shown in Ref. [8] and here that none of the interaction models recently tuned to LHC data provide a consistent description of the Auger data on EM and MPD profiles. The found discrepancies underline the complementarity of the information provided by the longitudinal profiles of the electromagnetic particles and the muons. The EM profile in a shower originates mainly from the decay products of high-energy neutral pions produced in the first few interactions and is thus closely related to the features of hadronic interactions at very high energies. In contrast, the MPD profile is an integral measure of high and intermediate energy interactions, as most charged pions decay only once they have reached energies below 30 GeV. While details of interactions at a few 100 GeV are insignificant for the EM profile, they are of direct relevance to muons. Hence, the measurement of muon profiles provides valuable insight that sets additional constraints on model descriptions and will help to improve our understanding of hadronic interactions.",
