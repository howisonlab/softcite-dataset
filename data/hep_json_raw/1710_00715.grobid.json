            "text": "It is remarkable that after a very long period of theoretical and experimental work, sometimes marked by heated controversies and debates, the original intuition of Bruno Pontecorvo in 1957 [1,2] was at last confirmed in the few years between 1998 and 2002 with the beautiful discoveries of atmospheric and solar neutrino oscillations by the Super-Kamioka Neutrino Detection Experiment (Super-Kamiokande) [3] and the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) [4], shortly thereafter confirmed by the Kamioka Liquid Scintillator Antineutrino Detector (KamLAND) experiment [5]. These discoveries have been recognized by the 2015 Nobel Prize in Physics awarded to Takaaki Kajita and Arthur Mc Donald. Since this milestone, experimental progress has been very fast, with the first significant indications of a nonzero value of the last unknown mixing angle \u03b8 13 by the long-baseline accelerator neutrino experiment Tokai-to-Kamioka (T2K) [6], and its discovery by the reactor experiments Daya Bay [7], Reactor Experiment for Neutrino Oscillations (RENO) [8] and Double Chooz [9]. The discovery of \u03bd \u00b5 \u2192 \u03bd e appearance by T2K in 2013 [10], later confirmed by the NuMI Off-Axis \u03bd e Appearance (NO\u03bdA) experiment [11], plays a special role for future developments since it has demonstrated neutrino appearance in a direct way and opened the way towards probing three-flavour effects. While experiments with natural sources have been at the forefront of the discovery of neutrino oscillations, recent precision measurements have been mainly carried out with man-made sources, like nuclear reactors and neutrino beams.",

This phenomenon, which we would now describe as active-sterile neutrino oscillations, required the neutrino to be massive, in contradiction with the then common belief that it was massless. The idea of neutrino flavour mixing emerged only later, around the time where the muon neutrino was discovered, in a paper by Maki, Nakagawa and Sakata [12]. Subsequently, neutrino flavour oscillations were proposed by Pontecorvo in 1967 [13] and presented in the modern formalism by Gribov and Pontecorvo in 1969  [14].",

            "text": "From Eq. 12, a few obvious comments can be made about the properties of neutrino oscillations. First of all, oscillations require neutrinos to have non-degenerate masses (\u2206m 2 ji = 0) and non-trivial flavour mixing (U = 1). The oscillation probability P (\u03bd \u03b1 \u2192 \u03bd \u03b2 ) depends on the three mixing angles \u03b8 12 , \u03b8 23 , \u03b8 13 and on two independent squared-mass differences, which can be chosen to be \u2206m 2 21 and \u2206m 2 31 (then \u2206m 2 32 is determined by \u2206m 2 32 = \u2206m 2 31 \u2212 \u2206m 2 21 ). Oscillations also depend on the \"Dirac\" CP-violating phase \u03b4 CP , but not on the \"Majorana phases\", as can be seen from the fact that the PMNS matrix entries appear in Eq. (12) only in the combinations U \u03b1i U * \u03b2i , to which the phases contained in the diagonal matrix P in Eq. 7do not contribute. Therefore, Dirac and Majorana neutrinos have the same oscillation probabilities. This fact can be understood on more general grounds, since oscillations conserve total lepton number, while the Majorana nature of neutrinos manifests itself in processes that violate lepton number, like neutrinoless double beta decay. Another consequence of formula (12) is that CP violation (namely, the fact that P (\u03bd \u03b1 \u2192\u03bd \u03b2 ) = P (\u03bd \u03b1 \u2192 \u03bd \u03b2 )) is possible only in appearance channels (\u03b2 = \u03b1), not in disappearance channels (\u03b2 = \u03b1). Indeed, the survival (i.e. non-oscillation) probability is the same for neutrinos and antineutrinos:",

This two-flavour formula has been used for decades, before oscillation experiments reached a level of precision that made them sensitive to subdominant effects. In particular, the oscillations of solar and atmospheric neutrinos turned out to be well described in the framework of two-flavour oscillations (with the inclusion of matter effects in the case of solar neutrinos, see Section 2.5) with parameters (\u2206m 2 sol , \u03b8 sol ) and (\u2206m 2 atm , \u03b8 atm ), respectively, such that \u2206m 2 sol \u2206m 2 atm and both mixing angles \u03b8 sol and \u03b8 atm are large. In order to interpret these results in the framework of three-flavour oscillations, the following conventions were adopted: (i) \u2206m 2 sol is identified with the squared-mass splitting between \u03bd 1 and \u03bd 2 ; (ii) these mass eigenstates are labelled in such a way that m 2 > m 1 , i.e. \u2206m 2 21 = \u2206m 2 sol > 0.

Note in passing that although governed by a single oscillation frequency, the probabilities (21) and (22) are not simple two-flavour formulae, as they depend on the two mixing angles \u03b8 13 and \u03b8 23 . In particular, Eq. (21) is sensitive to the octant of \u03b8 23 . When instead \u2206m 2 31 L/E 1 and \u2206m 2 21 L/E 1, \u2206m 2 31 -driven oscillations are averaged and oscillations of electron neutrinos are dominated by \u2206m 2 21 rather than \u2206m 2 31 .

This makes it possible to determine |\u2206m 2 31 | from the measurement of |\u2206m 2 ee | (assuming a given mass ordering and using the knowledge of \u03b8 12 and \u2206m 2 21 from other experiments), with a better precision than through Eq. (23). For more precise reactor neutrino experiments, a more accurate formula than Eq. (39) can be used to determine |\u2206m 2 ee | [57]. Long-baseline reactor neutrino experiments such that \u2206m 2 21 L/E \u223c 1 are sensitive to oscillations governed by \u2206m 2 21 , while the subleading \u2206m 2 31 -and \u2206m 2 32 -driven oscillations in Eq. (38) are averaged due to the limited energy resolution of the detector, leading to the survival probability (25). However, an improvement of the energy resolution could in principle render these experiments sensitive to the fast, small-amplitude oscillations governed by \u2206m 2 31 and \u2206m 2 32 that develop on top of the dominant \u2206m 2 21 -driven oscillations. It has been suggested that a precision measurement of the energy spectrum of reactor antineutrinos at a far detector would make it possible to distinguish between the normal and inverted mass hierarchies (see Section 9 for details). Indeed, the last two terms in Eq. (38) lead to different distorsions of the energy spectrum, depending on whether the hierarchy is normal (in which case |\u2206m 2 31 | > |\u2206m 2 32 |) or inverted (in which case |\u2206m 2 32 | > |\u2206m 2 31 |).",

In this review, we will essentially encounter matter effects of the type (i)-(iii), on which we therefore focus in this section (see also Refs. [34,35] for specialized reviews on the subject).

Matter effects can have a spectacular impact on oscillations when the vacuum mixing angle is small (this is the case only for \u03b8 13 in practice). Assuming non-maximal mixing in vacuum, one can identify three noticeable regimes: Due to their different interactions with matter, neutrinos and antineutrinos oscillate with unequal probabilities when they travel through a medium, even in the absence of CP violation. This effect is maximal at the resonance, where depending on the sign of \u2206m 2 cos 2\u03b8 either neutrino or antineutrino oscillations are resonantly enhanced. This property is used by experiments aiming at determining the mass hierarchy, i.e. whether \u2206m 2 31 > 0 or \u2206m 2 31 < 0.

Indeed, at night, neutrinos emitted by the Sun travel through the Earth before reaching the detector, leading to the so-called Earth regeneration effect [70]: part of the solar neutrinos that have oscillated into muon or tau neutrinos are converted back to electron neutrinos in the Earth. As a result, one can observe a day-night asymmetry in the solar neutrino data (which is numerically small in practice, see Section 3). The origin of this effect is simply that oscillation parameters in matter differ from oscillation parameters in vacuum. In particular, high-energy solar neutrinos exit the Sun in the mass eigenstate |\u03bd 2 (see Subsection 2.5.3), which is a propagation eigenstate in vacuum, but not in matter; hence they remain in the same state on their way from the Sun to the Earth, but they oscillate when they travel through the Earth (see the review [33] for details). Upward-going atmospheric neutrinos are also subject to Earth matter effects, which modify their zenith angle distribution with respect to the case of vacuum oscillations. This property can be exploited to determine the mass hierarchy with neutrino telescopes (see Section 9).",

It arises when the electron density in the neutrino production region (e.g. the center of the Sun) is much larger than the resonance density 11 , so that the neutrinos cross the resonance layer during their propagation. When this is the case, matter eigenstates approximately coincide with flavour eigenstates at production, as can be seen by taking the limit n e /n res \u2192 \u221e in Eq. 57and (58). For instance, in the center of the Sun, one has |\u03bd e |\u03bd m 2 (r = 0) and |\u03bd \u03b2 \u2212 |\u03bd m 1 (r = 0) (where |\u03bd \u03b2 describes a neutrino of either muon or tau flavour) for neutrino energies E 2 MeV, for which the condition n e (r = 0) n res is satisfied. Hence high-energy solar neutrinos are produced as quasi pure eigenstates of propagation in matter, and since their evolution is adiabatic, they remain in the instantaneous matter eigenstate |\u03bd m 2 (r) during their propagation. Eventually, they exit the Sun in the mass eigenstate |\u03bd 2 , since by continuity |\u03bd m 2 (r) = |\u03bd 2 at the radial coordinate r where the electron density vanishes. In other words, their flavour composition has changed as a result of the evolution of the instantaneous matter eigenstates: produced as pure electron neutrinos, they exit the Sun as mass eigenstates, i.e. as admixtures of all neutrino flavours. Finally, mass eigenstates being eigenstates of propagation in vacuum, they reach the Earth in the state |\u03bd 2 , leading to a survival probability P ee = | \u03bd e |\u03bd 2 | 2 sin 2 \u03b8 12 [60,61]. This formula describes reasonably well the behaviour of the high-energy part of the 8 B neutrino spectrum, which has been measured by the Super-Kamiokande and SNO experiments. Low-energy solar neutrinos (pp neutrinos), on the contrary, do not undergo adiabatic flavour conversions, but their evolution is dominated by vacuum oscillations. Indeed, they are characterized by a higher resonance density for which n e (r = 0) n res , so that matter effects can be neglected to a good approximation, leading to a survival probability P ee 1 \u2212 1 2 sin 2 2\u03b8 12 . A more general formula for the electron neutrino survival probability on Earth, valid for all solar neutrino energies, is given by [34] ",

It assumes in addition a constant electron density n e , which in practice is a good approximation up to very long baselines, since neutrinos travel only through the mantle for L 11000 km.

It therefore quantifies the importance of matter effects on \u2206m 2 31driven oscillations: the smaller A, the smaller the matter effects (since A 1 corresponds to n e n res ). One can check that, in the limit of negligible matter effects (i.e. A \u2192 0), Eq. (68) reduces to the vacuum formula (35). As mentioned in Section 2.3, the experimental challenge will be to disentangle matter effects from CP violation, since both of them create an asymmetry between \u03bd \u00b5 \u2192 \u03bd e and\u03bd \u00b5 \u2192\u03bd e oscillations, depending on the sign of \u2206m 2 31 for matter effects, and on the value of the \"Dirac\" phase \u03b4 CP for CP violation.",

This rules out the possibility of a fourth light active neutrino beyond the three ones already present in the Standard Model. It is not excluded, however, that additional neutrinos without electroweak interactions may exist. Such neutrinos, called sterile, would interact only through their mixing with the active neutrinos \u03bd eL , \u03bd \u00b5L , \u03bd \u03c4 L and (provided that they are light enough) would affect their oscillations. For this reason, sterile neutrinos with masses around 1 eV have been invoked as a possible explanation of experimental anomalies that cannot be accounted for in the framework of three-flavour oscillations (see Section 8). However, cosmological data, which constrains the number of effectively massless degrees of freedom to be N eff = 3.15 \u00b1 0.23 (68% C. L.) [76] and sets an upper bound on the sum of neutrino masses, is at odds with the hypothesis of a light sterile neutrino. In the following, we concentrate on the case of light (eV-scale) sterile neutrinos that is relevant to short-distance oscillations (for reviews on the subject, see e.g. Refs [39,40]).",

Since \u03b1 can be different from \u03b2, non-standard interactions violate neutrino flavour in general. In practice, only the operators with (q, q ) = (u, d), (\u03b3, \u03b4) = (e, \u00b5) and f = u, d, e can affect neutrino oscillations. The CC-NSI modify the neutrino production and detection processes, and can therefore induce flavour change even at very short distances. For instance, the operators (\u03bd eL \u03b3 \u00b5 \u00b5 L )(d\u03b3 \u00b5 P u) and (\u03bd eL \u03b3 \u00b5 \u00b5 L )(\u0113 L \u03b3 \u00b5 \u03bd eL ) induce the decays \u03c0 + \u2192 \u00b5 + \u03bd e and \u00b5 \u2212 \u2192 e \u2212\u03bd e \u03bd e , respectively, both of which mimic \u03bd \u00b5 \u2192 \u03bd e oscillations; in the detector, (\u03bd \u00b5L \u03b3 \u00b5 e L )(d\u03b3 \u00b5 P u) induces the reaction\u03bd \u00b5 + p \u2192 n + e + , which mimics\u03bd \u00b5 \u2192\u03bd e oscillations. The NC-NSI, on the other hand, affect neutrino propagation in matter [58]. Indeed, the operators (\u03bd \u03b1L \u03b3 \u00b5 \u03bd \u03b2L )(f \u03b3 \u00b5 P f ) modify the forward coherent scatterings of neutrinos on the electrons and nucleons of the medium, resulting in new, flavour-diagonal and off-diagonal contributions to the neutrino potential in matter, in addition to the standard contribution from W and Z boson exchange. The NC-NSI also have an impact on neutrino detection processes that do not involve the production of a charged lepton. For instance, the operators (\u03bd \u03b1L \u03b3 \u00b5 \u03bd \u03b2L )(\u0113\u03b3 \u00b5 P e) modify the neutrino-electron elastic scattering crosssection, thus affecting the solar neutrino rate measured by experiments like Super-Kamiokande.",

Given however that the operators (84)-(86) must arise from some gauge-invariant extension of the Standard Model, they are likely to be accompanied by operators such as (\u00af \u03b1L \u03b3 \u00b5 \u03b2L )(f \u03b3 \u00b5 P f ), with coefficients related to the f \u03b1\u03b2 .

New physics models in which the connection between non-standard neutrino interactions and chargedlepton flavour violation can be avoided have been found (see e.g. Refs.

The total flux \u03c6 of solar neutrinos on Earth can be estimated from the solar constant (or solar irradiance) F = 1.36 kW/m 2 as \u03c6 = 2F Es\u2212E\u03bd = 6.5 \u00d7 10 10 cm \u22122 s \u22121 . The resulting neutrino flux is due to several reaction chains contributing to the overall equation (87). The main reactions are shown in Table 1, and the expected neutrino flux is shown in Fig. 1. In addition to the pp chain, the catalytic CNO cycle involving carbon, nitrogen and oxygen nuclei also takes place in the Sun. This cycle is dominant in more massive stars, while in the Sun it only contributes about 1% of the total energy production [89]. The neutrinos produced by a given reaction in the chain are usually referred to by their parent particles. For the following of this discussion, it is important to notice that neutrinos from different reactions span different energy ranges. The vast majority of the neutrino flux is produced by the pp neutrinos, which are very difficult to observe because of their end point energy of 0.42 MeV. The so-called 8 B neutrinos are produced with energies up to 15 MeV and are easier to observe in experiments with high energy thresholds. Other reactions produce monoenergetic neutrino lines, namely the two 7 Be lines at 0.38 MeV (10%) and 0.86 MeV (90%) from electron capture on 7 Be nuclei, and the pep line at 1.44 MeV. It must be noticed that these reactions have different dependences Table 1: Nuclear fusion reactions in the Sun and their neutrino fluxes (in units cm \u22122 s \u22121 times the factor in the fifth column) according to the SSM GS98-SFII and AGSS09-SFII [89], with relative uncertainties shown in the column labeled \u03c3.

The argon production rate induced by solar neutrino was 0.48 counts per day, over a background of 0.09 counts per day due to the interactions initiated by highly energetic muons with nuclei (so-called cosmogenics). The 37 Ar half-life of 35 days allows to expose the tank for a period of 60-70 days, followed by the efficient extraction of the produced   37 Ar decays by electron capture: 90 % of these occur on the K-shell producing an average of 3.5 Auger electrons with 2.82 keV of total energy. Miniature gas proportional counters were developed to detect these decays with high efficiency and purity, achieving single-atom counting. The efficiency of the whole extraction chain was calibrated injecting known quantities of other argon isotopes ( 36 Ar and 38 Ar). The result of the Homestake chlorine experiment [93] for the capture rate is",

Starting from the first result in 1968, this major deficit triggered a thirty-year long debate, where many particle physicists were convinced that the SSM was not correct. Indeed, the production rate of 8 B neutrinos depends critically on the temperature of the Sun core as T 22 [89], and helioseismological data were not yet available at that time to confirm the validity of the SSM. It took more than twenty years before other radiochemical experiments could probe solar neutrinos ( Table 2).

The successive neutron detection techniques improved the sensitivity to the NC reactions. In the first phase, neutron capture on deuterium was used. In the second phase, NaCl was dissolved in the water and neutrons were detected through the neutron capture on 35 Cl followed by gamma emission. In the third phase, neutron detectors containing 3 He were inserted in the detector. The electron kinetic energy threshold was 5 MeV, making the experiment sensitive to the 8 B neutrinos. The results of all phases of the detector were in agreement and yielded a measurement of the total flux of solar neutrinos [99], irrespective of their flavour,",

            "text": "The atmosphere is constantly bombarded by primary cosmic rays, composed mainly of protons, with a smaller component, 5%, of \u03b1 particles, and an even smaller fraction of heavier nuclei. The interaction of these particles with atomic nuclei in the atmosphere produces hadronic showers composed mainly of pions and kaons. The decays of these mesons according to \u03c0 + \u2192 \u00b5 + \u03bd \u00b5 followed by \u00b5 + \u2192 e + \u03bd e\u03bd\u00b5 , K + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03bd \u00b5 and K L \u2192 \u03c0 + e \u2212 \u03bd e , together with their charge conjugated processes, produces a flux of \u03bd \u00b5 ,\u03bd \u00b5 and \u03bd e ,\u03bd e with a steeply falling power-law spectrum ( Fig. 4), approximately E \u22122.7 in the region above 1 GeV. The calculation of this neutrino flux (see Ref. [110] for a review) relies on the knowledge of the primary cosmic ray flux and composition, of the Earth magnetic field, and of the hadro-production cross-section on the light nuclei of the Earth atmosphere. Detailed studies [109,111,112,113,114] taking into account three-dimensional effects improve on previous efforts and reach a precision of 7-8% for the flux in the 1-10 GeV range [113]. It should be noticed that the ratio N (\u03bd \u00b5 +\u03bd \u00b5 )/N (\u03bd e +\u03bd e ) is predicted with a much better precision of 2% [113], as several systematic uncertainties cancel out in this ratio. In the limiting case where all the muons from pion decays decay in flight, this ratio is close to 2, as can be easily deduced from the decay processes mentioned above. This case is approximately realized in the region of sub-GeV atmospheric neutrinos.",

The events can be further classified according to the number of Cherenkov rings observed (if more than one ring is detected, the event is termed \"multi-ring\"), the observed total energy and the number of decay electrons. Electrons and muons can be reliably identified (the misidentification probability is 0.7% [133]) on the basis of the ring properties. Cherenkov rings produced by muons have sharp edges, while in the case of electrons the photons are produced by the numerous electrons and positrons in the electromagnetic shower, with angular dispersion due to scattering, resulting in a ring with diffuse edges. The momentum resolution for an isolated ring produced by a lepton of momentum p is 0.6% + 2.6%/ p(GeV/c) [133].

The long-baseline beams are based on the so-called wide-band beam concept. Here the secondary charged mesons are focused using a system of magnetic devices, called horns.

Protons from the Main Injector with an energy of 120 GeV were used with a tunable setup allowing to vary the neutrino energy, mostly used in the position giving a 1-3 GeV neutrino beam. The far detector was a 5.4 kton magnetized steel-scintillator calorimeter. In 2014 MINOS [139] reported a combined fit using also a data set of atmospheric neutrinos (37.88 kton-year) yielding |\u2206m The current generation of experiments, T2K and NO\u03bdA, use a narrow band beam based on the off-axis design, which is particularly suited for the measurement of \u03bd \u00b5 disappearance once the relevant squared-mass difference is known. For a given value of \u2206m 2 32 and a given baseline, the oscillation probability depends on the neutrino energy, which can be tuned by changing the off-axis angle. In the case of T2K (L=295 km), the maximum of the oscillation is at an energy of 600 MeV, while in the case of NO\u03bdA (L=810 km) the maximum is at 1,800 MeV.",

The reconstructed energy spectrum for \u03bd \u00b5 events is shown in Fig. 10. Thanks to the use of the Near Detector data described in Section 4.6, the systematic uncertainties on these measurements are at the 5% level, and a precise measurement of \u03b8 23 and \u2206m 2 32 is obtained, as shown in Fig. 11.

The detector is based on the Emulsion Cloud Chamber technique, with 1,800 tons of nuclear emulsion detectors in the form of bricks, each brick being composed of a stack of nuclear emulsion films and lead plates. This target, capable of sub-micrometric track resolution, is devoted to the study of the neutrino interaction vertex and of the particles associated to it. The identification of the \u03c4 leptons relies mainly on their characteristic kink ( Fig. 14) due to the decay \u03c4 \u2192 h\u03bd \u03c4 , or \u03c4 \u2192 l\u03bd \u03c4\u03bdl , where h is a charged meson, and l is an electron or a muon. Another signature is related to the decay \u03c4 \u2192 3h\u03bd \u03c4 where the short \u03c4 track ends in a three-pronged vertex. The target detectors are complemented by scintillator trackers and muon spectrometers.",

            "text": "Nuclear reactors are intense sources of electron antineutrinos. Indeed, the fission processes, starting from uranium enriched in the 235 U isotope, generate unstable neutron-rich nuclei that undergo \u03b2 \u2212 decays. A typical example is 235 U + n \u2192 140 Ba + 94 Kr + 2n, releasing an energy of 200 MeV. This is followed by six \u03b2 \u2212 decays producing 6 electron antineutrinos. A 2800 MW reactor produces a flux of 5 \u00d7 10 20\u03bd e per second. The typical antineutrino energy is of the order of a few MeV. At these energies, an antineutrino interacting on a proton can initiate an Inverse Beta Decay (IBD) process\u03bd e p \u2192 n e + , which has a threshold of 1.8 MeV. The cross-section of this process can be calculated to high precision from the related neutron decay process [177,178]. The visible energy E vis produced by the positron, neglecting the small nuclear recoil, is related to the antineutrino energy E \u03bd by E vis = E \u03bd \u2212 (m n \u2212 m p ) + m e , where m e is the electron mass. The convolution of the \u03b2 decay spectrum of antineutrinos (rapidly falling off with energy) with the IBD cross-section (rising with energy) results in a detected antineutrino spectrum peaking at approximately 4 MeV (Fig. 15).",

A measurement at a single energy and baseline of P (\u03bd \u00b5 \u2192 \u03bd e ) and P (\u03bd \u00b5 \u2192\u03bd e ), even with infinite precision, would lead to multiple ambiguities in the determination of the underlying parameters. This is due to three independent two-fold parameter degeneracies: (\u03b4 CP , \u03b8 13 ), the sign of \u2206m 2 31 (that is the mass ordering) and (\u03b8 23 , \u03c0/2 \u2212 \u03b8 23 ) [196]. The first degeneracy is solved by precision measurements of \u03b8 13 at reactors. The second degeneracy is lifted by comparing measurements at different baselines, like T2K and NO\u03bdA for the running experiments, or DUNE and Hyper-Kamionande in the next decade (see for instance Refs. [197,198]). Moreover, both DUNE and Hyper-Kamiokande are considering the possibility of multiple L/E within the same experiment. DUNE will achieve this with a wide-band beam, capable of some sensitivity at the second oscillation maximum. Hyper-Kamiokande is considering a second detector in Korea on the same beam line, but at a very different L around 1100 km. In addition, Hyper-Kamiokande will benefit from a large sample of atmospheric neutrinos. In any case, the precise determination of \u03b8 23 will become increasingly difficult if the true value lies very close to \u03c0/4 [199].",

A total of 28 electron neutrino candidates were detected in Super-Kamiokande, while 4.92 \u00b1 0.55 background events were expected for \u03b8 13 = 0. The selection of these events in Super-Kamiokande is performed requiring fully contained, one-ring electron-like events. The background due to NC interactions with \u03c0 0 production is reduced by a factor 9 with a special algorithm [141] testing the hypothesis of two electromagnetic showers, corresponding to \u03c0 0 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3. The purity of the final sample is 80% for \u03bd \u00b5 \u2192 \u03bd e oscillated events, while the remaining background is mainly due to the irreducible beam \u03bd e background (15%) and to NC events (4.4 %). The distribution of lepton momentum and angle (with respect to the beam direction) for these events is shown in Fig. 19. The significance of this measurement corresponds to 7.3 \u03c3.",

            "text": "T2K has recently published its first oscillation analysis obtained combining data taken with neutrino and antineutrino beams with approximately the same amount of POT [155]. With this data set, 32 e-like candidates are observed at SK in neutrino mode and 4 in antineutrino mode. The expected number of events depends on the value of \u03b4 CP and on the mass ordering, as shown in Table 6. They vary between 19.6 and 28.7 (17.1 and 25.4) for normal (inverted) ordering in neutrino mode and between 6.0 and 7.7 (6.5 and 7.4) in antineutrino mode. The value \u03b4 CP = \u2212\u03c0/2 maximizes the \u03bd e appearance probability and minimizes the \u03bd e appearance probability while the opposite happens for \u03b4 CP = \u03c0/2. Table 6: Number of events for the \u03bd e and \u03bd e selection in \u03bd and\u03bd modes expected for various values of \u03b4 CP and both mass orderings, compared with the observed numbers in the T2K experiment [155]. Since T2K observes a mild excess of \u03bd e candidates with respect to the most favourable value and a deficit of \u03bd e candidates, a value of \u03b4 CP close to \u2212\u03c0/2 and the normal ordering are preferred by the data even without the inclusion of the reactor constraint for the measurement of \u03b8 13 . This is shown in Fig. 20. For the first time, long-baseline experiments have a sensitivity to \u03b4 CP without considering independent informations from reactors, and a good agreement between the value of \u03b8 13 measured by the reactors and the one measured by T2K is observed. | m 2 32 | plane assuming normal ordering, alongside NOvA [42], MINOS+ [43], SK [44], and IceCube [45] confidence regions. 2 ln L as a function of CP for the normal (black) and inverted (red) mass ordering.

The collaboration observed 33 \u03bd e candidate events at the far detector with 8.2 \u00b1 0.8 background events expected. The prediction for the signal events vary from 28.2 (normal ordering, \u03b4 CP = \u2212\u03c0/2) to 11.2 (inverted ordering, \u03b4 CP = \u03c0/2). A joint analysis of appearance and disappearance channels has been performed and the results in the sin 2 \u03b8 23 -\u03b4 CP plane are shown in Fig. 21. Given the non-maximal \u03b8 23 value found by NO\u03bdA, there are two degenerate best fit points, both in the normal ordering, (sin 2 \u03b8 23 = 0.404, \u03b4 CP = 1.48 \u03c0) and (sin 2 \u03b8 23 = 0.623, \u03b4 CP = 0.74 \u03c0). This is a practical illustration of the degeneracy problem discussed previously. The inverted mass ordering in the lower octant is disfavoured at greater than 93% C.L. for all values of \u03b4 CP , and excluded at greater than 3 \u03c3 significance outside the range 0.97 \u03c0 < \u03b4 CP < 1.94\u03c0. These data are in agreement with T2K results but clearly both experiments are still dominated by the statistical uncertainty. The updates of these results will be of great interest for the determination of the remaining unknown neutrino oscillation parameters.",

Fully contained events are divided into subsamples based on their number of reconstructed Cherenkov rings, their energy, the particle ID (PID) of their most energetic ring and the number of observed Michel electrons.

Moreover, the statistical significance is far from being compelling and does not exceed 3\u03c3. Repeated and numerous attempts have been made to interpret these anomalies in models where the three known active neutrinos mix with a fourth sterile state (3+1) or with two new sterile states (3+2). In the 3+1 model, in the limit where the \u2206m 2 21 -and \u2206m 2 31 -driven oscillations can be neglected, the \u03bd e (\u03bd e ) survival probability is given by Eq.

Therefore, to explain the results of the LSND and MiniBooNE experiments, both U e4 and U \u00b54 must be different from zero. The formulae are more complex for the 3+2 model, which contains a larger number of free parameters. The new feature of this scheme with respect to the 3+1 model is that it allows for CP violation in short-baseline appearance experiments (see subsection 2.6). Global fits to the world dataset including these anomalies and all other experimental results on neutrino oscillation measurements and searches have been attempted [215,216]. The result is that there is a strong tension between appearance experiments like LSND and MiniBooNE and the negative results from disappearance experiments like CERN-Dortmund-Heidelberg-Saclay (CDHS) [217]. Oscillations in the\u03bd \u00b5 \u2192\u03bd e channel inevitably entail disappearance in the\u03bd \u00b5 \u2192\u03bd \u00b5 channel with the same L/E range. This disappearance has not been observed. The compatibility of appearance and disappearance data is at the level of 10 \u22124 for the 3+1 model [216]. More complex schemes like the 3+2 model, which was considered initially to reduce the tension between the neutrino and antineutrino MiniBooNE data (this tension has almost completely disappeared from the final data, reducing the motivation for this model), do not improve the compatibility between appearance and disappearance data. The authors of Ref. [215] propose to exclude the MiniBooNE low-energy bins to improve the goodness of fit.  Figure 23: Left plot: the reconstructed energy distribution of atmospheric \u03bd \u00b5 events observed by the IceCube experiment compared to the prediction without sterile neutrinos [218]. Right plot: the 99% CL contour (red solid line) in the \u2206m 2 41 versus sin 2 2\u03b8 24 plane obtained by the IceCube experiment [218] is shown with bands containing 68% (green) and 95% (yellow) of the 99% CL contours in simulated pseudoexperiments. The contours and bands are overlaid on 90% CL exclusions from previous experiments [219,220,221,217] and the MiniBooNE / LSND 90% CL allowed region with different assumptions on |U e4 | 2 [222,223] Very recent data actually bring more experimental evidence against the LSND and MiniBooNE anomalies. The IceCube has studied the atmospheric muon neutrino spectrum in the energy range 320 GeV to 20 TeV [224]. Muon neutrino mixing with a sterile state with \u2206m 2 41 in the 1 eV 2 range would significantly deplete the antineutrino spectrum in the 3+1 model, due to MSW resonance effects related to neutrino propagation in the Earth. The observed deficit can reach 11% for the bin with the largest effect in the distribution of reconstructed energy and zenith angle. Similar effects would deplete the neutrino spectrum in the 1+3 model. No depletion is observed in a sample of 20,145 well reconstructed muons registered with an 86 string configuration in 2011 and 2012. This allows to set strong limits in the \u2206m 2 versus sin 2 2\u03b8 plane. The allowed region from the appearance experiments LSND and MiniBooNE is excluded at the 99% CL (Fig. 23).",

            "text": "An interesting limit has been set by a combined analysis of the MINOS, Daya Bay and Bugey-3 data [225]. MINOS is sensitive to a sterile neutrino as active (mainly \u03bd \u00b5 in this case)-sterile mixing would modify the shape and normalization of charged current and neutral current events in the near and far detectors. It can therefore set limits on |U \u00b54 | 2 . Bugey-3 and Daya Bay data can be used to constrain electron antineutrino disappearance and place limits on |U e4 | 2 . The combination of these three experiments excludes the phase space allowed by the LSND and MiniBooNE experiments for \u2206m 2 41 below 0.8 eV 2 at 95% CL . The reactor and Gallium anomalies are not in such a conflict with other measurements, since they do not require U \u00b54 to be different from zero. In this sector, recent developments have focussed on the reliability of the systematic uncertainty related to the understanding of the reactor antineutrino flux. The observation of the 5 MeV shoulder [188,189] has indeed brought under close scrutiny the method to compute the reactor antineutrino flux. The conclusions of recent studies [226,227] are that several uncertainties might have been underestimated. For instance, 30% of the flux comes from forbidden transitions. The effect of various shape corrections applied to forbidden transitions has been investigated and it leads to a 4-5% uncertainty on the reactor antineutrino flux. Taking into account this uncertainty would considerably release the tension at the origin of the reactor anomaly.",

[234] for a review and references therein) has been built to investigate in detail the possible mixing of \u03bd e with a sterile state with \u2206m 2 41 in the eV 2 range. Indeed,\u03bd e \u2192\u03bd s oscillations would induce a deformation of the spectrum if the detector is placed close enough (L 10 m) to the reactor core. Several of these experiments have started data taking in 2016 or 2017, and new results on this hot topic are expected soon. A different technique [235] is used by the Short distance neutrino Oscillations with BoreXino (SOX) experiment [236] that will deploy an intense 144 Ce antineutrino source very close to the Borexino detector with data taking foreseen in 2018.",

In the normal hierarchical scenario, m The experiments searching for neutrinoless double beta decay (see e.g. Ref.

            "text": "While the study of CP violation in the lepton sector requires neutrino beams, several different techniques can be used for the measurement of the mass ordering. It is generally the case that, in order to be able to determine the mass ordering, the experiment must be sensitive either to three-flavour effects or to matter effects. Indeed, the two-flavour vacuum oscillation probability takes the form P (\u03bd \u03b1 \u2192 \u03bd \u03b2 ) = sin 2 2\u03b8 sin 2 ( \u2206m 2 L 4E ), which is insensitive to the sign of \u2206m 2 . As we have seen in section 9.1, the mass ordering can be determined by exploiting matter effects in long-baseline experiments like NO\u03bdA, and can be measured for any value of \u03b4 CP by doing experiments with a longer baseline such as the proposed DUNE experiment, which will be described in the next section. Other possibilities to measure the mass ordering are provided by matter effects in atmospheric neutrino oscillations [247], or by testing the interference between \u2206m 2 32 and \u2206m 2 31 [248]. The latter idea is exploited by the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) experiment [249] using nuclear reactors. Antineutrinos produced in nuclear reactors are detected with energies in the range (1.8 \u2212 8) MeV. For E = 4 MeV, the first oscillation maximum driven by \u2206m 2 21 occurs at a distance of roughly 65 km from the reactor core, while the oscillation maximum driven by \u2206m 2 32 occurs at a distance of roughly 2 km. As we have seen in the previous sections, the first effect is exploited by KamLAND to measure \u03b8 12 and \u2206m 2 21 , while the latter is exploited by Daya Bay, RENO and Double Chooz to measure \u03b8 13 .",

In order to extract the information on mass ordering from the rapid spectral distortions, an excellent energy resolution (3%/ \u221a E with E in MeV), a good understanding of the energy response (better than 1%) and a large statistics (> 100, 000 inverse beta decay events) are required [249]. This statistics will be obtained thanks to the large size of the JUNO detector, while the needed precision on the energy resolution and on the energy response will be more difficult to reach, and requires important improvements with respect to what has been achieved in the Daya Bay experiment. In particular, it is required to have a PMT photocathode coverage larger than 75%, a PMT quantum efficiency larger than 35% and an attenuation length of the liquid scintillator larger than 20 m at 430 nm.

The idea is to exploit the difference in the oscillation probabilities of neutrinos and antineutrinos that are induced by matter effects when they cross the Earth. The oscillation probabilities, or oscillograms, for the two mass orderings are shown in Fig. 28 as a function of the energy and the cosine of the zenith angle \u03b8 z . The qualitative features of these oscillograms can be understood as follows, modelling the Earth as made of two layers, the mantle with an almost constant density of about 5 g/cm 3 above a radius of 3483 km, and the core with a density of about 11 g/cm 3 below that radius. The most prominent features of these oscillograms are the \u03bd \u00b5 \u2192 \u03bd e MSW resonance in the mantle for E 7 GeV, visible at cos \u03b8 z \u22120.8, and the MSW resonance in the core for E 3 GeV and cos \u03b8 z < \u22120.8. As already explained, the resonance is present either in the neutrino channel for NO or in the antineutrino channel for IO. This resonance has a spectacular effect in the \u03bd \u00b5 \u2192 \u03bd e channel, and results in smaller but significant differences in the oscillograms for \u03bd \u00b5 \u2192 \u03bd \u00b5 between the NO and IO cases (Fig. 28). The finer structure seen in the cos \u03b8 z < \u22120.8 region is due to resonance effects related to the interference between propagation in the mantle and in the core [251,252].",

However, the effect is strongly diluted. Smearing of the reconstructed energy and angle dilutes this effect even more. Once the atmospheric neutrino fluxes and the neutrino-nucleon cross-section are taken into account, bidimensional plots of event rates as a function of the neutrino energy and zenith angle can be built, as shown in Fig. 29. Although the asymmetry is partially washed out, there is still a certain sensitivity to the mass ordering.",

The technique is similar to the one used by IceCube [136] and ANTARES [149] to observe high-energy neutrinos produced by cosmic rays, but, in order to improve the energy and direction reconstruction, a much denser arrays of PMTs must be built, at the price of instrumenting a smaller volume. Indeed, one of the challenges of these experiments is to reach an energy threshold around 5 GeV, which is considerably lower than the 15 GeV threshold of the IceCube Deep-Core denser instrumented volume. This requires to arrange the PMTs at close distance, around 10 m. Moreover, another challenge is to control the systematic uncertainties related to the reconstruction of the energy and the momentum.",

The two projects for the next generation of long-baseline experiments are the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) [144] in the US and the Hyper-Kamiokande experiment [143] in Japan. Both experiments will be multi-purpose detectors, searching for proton decay and neutrinos produced in core-collapse supernovae explosions, and measuring solar and atmospheric neutrinos. In the context of this review, we focus on the measurements that are important for a better understanding of the PMNS matrix. DUNE [144] will use an innovative technology with Liquid Argon as target for neutrino interactions, performing a calorimetric measurement of the particles produced in neutrino interactions. Neutrinos will be produced at FNAL using protons from the Main Ring, and will be sent to the Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF) in South Dakota, 1,300 km away from FNAL. DUNE will build four large (10 kton) Liquid Argon time projection chambers as target for neutrino interactions. When neutrinos interact with the Argon, charged particles are produced that cross the medium, ionizing and exciting Argon nuclei. This produces both ionization and scintillation signals that are detected by a readout system. The careful collection of the ionization electrons allows for a three-dimensional reconstruction of the charged tracks and showers, and hence of the properties of the neutrino responsible for the interaction. Two options are contemplated for the readout of the ionization electrons: a single-phase readout, where the electrons are collected using wire planes in the liquid argon volume, and a dual-phase approach, where the electrons are amplified and detected in a gaseous argon region above the liquid. The single-phase readout is based on the technology used for the ICARUS detector [256], while for the dual-phase readout several small-scale prototypes have been built in the last years [257]. An extended R&D program is ongoing to demonstrate that both technologies are suitable to build a 10 kton module. Two prototypes, one for the single phase (ProtoDUNE-SP) [258] and one for the dual phase (ProtoDUNE-DP/WA105) [259] of roughly 300 tons, scalable to larger masses, are being built at CERN and will be exposed to a charged-particle beam in 2018.",

The neutrino flux will cover both the first and the second oscillation maxima, which given the 1,300 km baseline correspond to energies of 2.5 GeV and 0.8 GeV, respectively. At energy above 2 GeV, multiple tracks are produced in charged current neutrino interactions and high efficiency is required to reconstruct all the final state particles. The high granularity of a liquid Argon detector is therefore better suited at these energies than Water Cherenkov detectors, for which most of the charged particles are below the Cherenkov threshold and cannot be reconstructed. Thanks to the very long-baseline of DUNE, the effects of the mass ordering and of CP violation are decoupled, as shown in Fig. 18. The strategy is to collect neutrino and anti-neutrino data by changing the direction of the current in the magnetic horns, and to measure \u03bd \u00b5 and \u03bd \u00b5 disappearance and \u03bd e and \u03bd e appearance probabilities. The combination of the four samples allows a clean measurement of the mass ordering for any value of \u03b4 CP and in both ordering hypotheses, as shown in Fig. 30. As far as the measurement of CP violation is concerned, the sensitivity depends on the value of \u03b4 CP .

However, under appropriate coherence conditions, these approaches lead to the same oscillation probability as the standard derivation presented here. See e.g. Ref.[49] for a discussion.",
