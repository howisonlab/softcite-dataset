The combination of different channels, across the same experiment, provides also an advantage in the evaluation of the correlated systematic uncertainties. For example effects like Jet Energy Scale (JES) uncertainty or b-tag efficiency measurement on MC are shared across all the channels and we fit for their best value [18], in this way a higher statistical sample poses a stronger constraint on these systematics than each channel by itself. Figure 4 shows that the CDF experiment by itself excludes, at 95% C.L., the presence of a Higgs boson for M H < 105 GeV/c 2 , giving an independent confirmation of the LEP [19] exclusion in the same region. The exclusion limit can be extended further combining the results from both the CDF and D0 experiments [20].",

For example, even though the diphoton final state has a tiny branching fraction, it can still contribute significantly  Another reason to pursue these secondary channels is that non-SM theories may predict enhanced yield. For example the H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 analyses can be reinterpreted in the light of a fermiophobic Higgs boson theory where the couplings to the fermions are depressed [26].
