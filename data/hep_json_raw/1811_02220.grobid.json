The fragmentation contribution, by its higher-order nature, can only provide a partial information on the initial hard scattering. However, it can be largely reduced thanks to an isolation method giving access to LO photons, allowing to test pQCD and constrain parton distribution functions (PDFs in pp and nPDFs in heavy-ion collisions) [1].",

In order to access LO photons the fragmentation photon contribution must be rejected. However, both cannot be disentangled at the detector level but one can strongly reduce the latter using an isolation method. This technique, which takes advantage of the fact that LO photons are likely produced at the other end of other collision remnants, consists in measuring the total activity p iso T in a cone of radius R cone = (\u03b7 \u2212 \u03b7 \u03b3 ) 2 + (\u03d5 \u2212 \u03d5 \u03b3 ) 2 defined around a candidate photon (\u03b7 \u03b3 , \u03d5 \u03b3 ), summing the transverse momentum of all particles (\u03b7, \u03d5) inside. The neutral contribution to this activity is measured with EMCal neutral clusters whereas the charged contribution is determined with tracks from the ITS and TPC detectors. In the work presented here, photons are considered isolated for R cone = 0.4 and p iso T < 2 GeV/c, values determined with pQCD calculations to reduce the fragmentation contribution from 45% to 15% of all direct photons at E T = 60 GeV [1].",

At low p T , decay photons are statistically subtracted from the inclusive photon yield to obtain the direct photon contribution using several independent reconstruction techniques. These measurements in pp and p-Pb collisions are fully consistent with pQCD calculations at NLO whereas in central Pb-Pb collisions an excess compatible with the presence of QGP is observed. At high p T , the direct photon yield is extracted with an isolation method allowing to strongly reduce the fragmentation and decay photon contributions. This measurement in pp collisions extends the p T reach compared to previous results while showing a good agreement with pQCD throughout the probed p T range.
