            "text": "Based on data samples collected with the BESIII detector at the BEPCII collider at 9 center-ofmass energies from 4.21 to 4.42 GeV, we search for the production of e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c9\u03c7cJ (J = 0, 1, 2). The process e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c9\u03c7c0 is observed for the first time, and the Born cross sections at \u221a s = 4.23 and 4.26 GeV are measured to be (55.4 \u00b1 6.0 \u00b1 5.9) and (23.7 \u00b1 5.3 \u00b1 3.5) pb, respectively, where the first uncertainties are statistical and the second are systematic. The \u03c9\u03c7c0 signals at the other 7 energies and e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c9\u03c7c1 and \u03c9\u03c7c2 signals are not significant, and the upper limits on the cross sections are determined. By examining the \u03c9\u03c7c0 cross section as a function of center-of-mass energy, we find that it is inconsistent with the line shape of the Y (4260) observed in e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8. Assuming the \u03c9\u03c7c0 signals come from a single resonance, we extract mass and width of the resonance to be (4230 \u00b1 8 \u00b1 6) MeV/c 2 and (38 \u00b1 12 \u00b1 2) MeV, respectively, and the statistical significance is more than 9\u03c3. The charmonium-like state Y (4260) was first observed in its decay to \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8 [1], and its decays into \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 J/\u03c8 and K + K \u2212 J/\u03c8 were reported from a study of 12.6 pb \u22121 data collected at 4.26 GeV by the CLEO-c experiment [2]. Contrary to the hidden charm final states, the Y (4260) were found to have small coupling to open charm decay modes [3], as well as to light hadron final states [4,5]. Recently, charged charmoniumlike states Z c (3900) [\u03c0 \u00b1 J/\u03c8] [6][7][8], Z c (3885) [(DD * ) \u00b1 ] [9], Z c (4020) [(\u03c0h c )] [10,11], and Z c (4025) [(D * D * ) \u00b1 ] [12] were observed in e + e \u2212 data collected around \u221a s = 4.26 GeV. These features suggest the existence of a complicated substructure of the Y (4260) \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8 as well as the nature of the Y (4260) itself. Searches for new decay modes and measuring the line shape may provide information that is useful for understanding the nature of the Y (4260).",

The fit results for the resonance parameters are \u0393 ee B(\u03c9\u03c7 c0 ) = (2.7 \u00b1 0. The systematic uncertainties in the Born cross section measurement mainly originate from the radiative correction, the luminosity measurement, the detection efficiency, and the kinematic fit. A 10% uncertainty of in the radiative correction is estimated by varying the line shape of the cross section in the generator from the  measured energy-dependent cross section to the Y (4260) BW shape. Due to the limitation of the statistics, this item imports the biggest uncertainty. The polar angle \u03b8 of the \u03c9 in the e + e \u2212 center-of-mass frame is defined as the angle between \u03c9 and e \u2212 beam. For the \u03c9\u03c7 c0 channel, the distribution of \u03b8 is obtained from data taken at 4.23 GeV and fitted with 1 + \u03b1 cos 2 \u03b8. The value of \u03b1 is determined to be \u22120.28 \u00b1 0.31. The efficiencies are determined from MC simulations, and the uncertainty is estimated by varying \u03b1 within one standard deviation. For the \u03c9\u03c7 c1,2 channels, a 1% uncertainty is estimated by varying the \u03c9 angular distribution from flat to 1 \u00b1 cos 2 \u03b8. The uncertainty of luminosity is 1%. The uncertainty in tracking efficiency is 1% per track. The uncertainty in photon reconstruction is 1% per photon. A 1% uncertainty in the kinematic fit is estimated by correcting the helix parameters of charged tracks [24].",

The uncertainty due to the cross feed is estimated to be 1% by using the signal MC samples. A 4% uncertainty from the fitting range is obtained by varying the limits of the fitting range by \u00b10.05 GeV/c 2 . The uncertainty from the mass resolution is determined to be negligible compared to the resolutions of the reconstructed \u03c9 in data and MC samples.

The systematic uncertainty of the Born cross section (except that from 1 + \u03b4 v ) contributes uncertainty in \u0393 ee B(\u03c9\u03c7 c0 ). By adding all these sources of systematic uncertainties in quadrature, we obtain uncertainties of \u00b16 MeV/c 2 , \u00b12 MeV, and \u00b10.4 eV for the mass, width, and the partial width, respectively. In summary, based on data samples collected between \u221a s = 4.21 and 4.42 GeV collected with the BE-SIII detector, the process e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c9\u03c7 c0 is observed at \u221a s = 4.23 and 4.26 GeV for the first time, and the Born cross sections are measured to be (55.4 \u00b1 6.0 \u00b1 5.9) and (23.7\u00b15.3\u00b13.5) pb, respectively. For other energy points, no significant signals are found and upper limits on the cross section at the 90% C.L. are determined. The data reveals a sizeable \u03c9\u03c7 c0 production around 4.23 GeV/c 2 as predicted in Ref. [14]. By assuming the \u03c9\u03c7 c0 signals come from a single resonance, we extract the \u0393 ee B(\u03c9\u03c7 c0 ), mass, and width of the resonance to be (2.7\u00b10.5\u00b10.4) eV, (4230\u00b18\u00b16) MeV/c 2 , and (38\u00b112\u00b12) MeV, respectively. The parameters are inconsistent with those obtained by fitting a single resonance to the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8 cross section [1]. This suggests that the observed \u03c9\u03c7 c0 signals be unlikely to originate from the Y (4260). The e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c9\u03c7 c1,2 channels are also sought for, but no significant signals are observed; upper limits at the 90% C.L. on the production cross sections are determined.

For the \u221a s = 4.26 GeV data, the total signal yield is 45.5\u00b110.2 with a statistical significance of 5.5\u03c3, and \u03c7 2 /d.o.f. = 27.1/15. Since the statistics at the other energy points are very limited, the number of the observed events is obtained by counting the entries in the \u03c7 c0 signal region [3.38, 3.45] GeV/c 2 , and the number of background events in the signal region is obtained by fitting the M (\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) [M (K + K \u2212 )] spectrum excluding the \u03c7 c0 signal region and scaling to the size of the signal region.",
