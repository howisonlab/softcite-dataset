Precise knowledge of its mass is important for imposing constraints on a number of physics processes, including interactions of the as yet unobserved Higgs boson. The Higgs boson is the only missing particle of the Standard Model, central to the electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism and generation of particle masses. In this Review, experimental measurements of the top quark mass accomplished at the Tevatron, a proton-antiproton collider located at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, are described. Topologies of top quark events and methods used to separate signal events from background sources are discussed. Data analysis techniques used to extract information about the top mass value are reviewed. The combination of several most precise measurements performed with the two Tevatron particle detectors, CDF and D\u00d8, yields a value of M t = 173.2 \u00b1 0.9 GeV/c 2 .",

The addition of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), which describes the strong interactions that bind quarks into protons and neutrons, completes the Standard Model (SM). The elements of this unified theory are six quarks, six leptons and five gauge bosons. The gauge bosons are the W \u00b1 and Z (carriers of the weak force), the photon (carrier of the electromagnetic force) and the gluon (carrier of the strong force). An additional neutral scalar boson, the Higgs boson, is necessary to explain electroweak (EWK) symmetry breaking, i.e., the observation of non-zero masses of the W \u00b1 and Z bosons. It also generates quark and lepton masses through the Yukawa interaction. A recent review of EWK symmetry breaking scenarios can be found in an earlier issue of this journal [1].",

            "text": "The top quark is the heaviest fundamental fermion. Prior to its direct observation, its mass was predicted through a fit to a number of EWK observables sensitive to virtual top quark effects. This prediction, however, had a very large uncertainty (for historical details, see a plot of top mass expectations and measurements versus time in [2]). The mass of the still unobserved Higgs boson, M H , is related within the electroweak theory to the W boson mass, M W , and the top quark mass, M t , through quantum loop corrections. Some of the lowest order diagrams that link M W , M t , and M H are shown in Precision measurements of the masses of the W boson and the top quark are essential to predict the mass of the Higgs boson. An overall fit of EWK observables including the W and the top masses can put constraints on the Higgs mass [3]. Figure 2 illustrates the relationship between the three masses, given current measurements. The Standard Model fit of 18 EWK observables (without the mass measurements) constrains the Higgs mass to lie inside the dashed contour, while the precision with which the W and top masses are currently known constrains the Higgs mass to the smaller solid contour. From the latter we see that a change of 1 GeV/c 2 in the top mass shifts the predicted central value of the Higgs mass by \u223c 10 GeV/c 2 .",

            "text": "The discovery of the bottom quark in 1977 [4] set in motion the search for its partner in the third fermion doublet. Experimental lower limits on the top mass slowly increased from a few GeV/c 2 until the top quark was observed and its mass was directly measured at the Tevatron 18 years later [5,6]. A first hint for the top quark was reported by the CDF collaboration in [7], together with a mass value of 174 \u00b1 10 \u00b1 13 GeV/c 2 . Today, the measured value of the top quark mass is not very far from this very early estimate. Increased  statistics, better understanding of detector performance, and better measurement techniques have reduced the uncertainty considerably. The top quark is much heavier than its partner, the bottom quark, whose mass is about 5 GeV/c 2 (see [8] for a review on quark masses). The Yukawa coupling of the top quark, \u03bb t = 2 3/4 G 1/2 F M t , is of order unity. This raises the question if the top quark is distinct from the other quarks, i.e., does it have a special role in the electroweak symmetry breaking? A dynamical breaking of EWK theory by a top quark condensate was proposed even before the top quark was discovered [9], later extended to a topcolor model [10]. So far no experimental evidence for the validity of such a model has been found.",

It is normally assumed that what is being measured is the pole mass, M pole . The relation between M pole and the mass in the M S scheme, M M S , can be computed within perturbative QCD.

With such a short lifetime ( 1/\u039b QCD ), top quark decays before hadronizing. Observation of its decay products allows for a direct measurement of its mass, a unique feature among quarks [8]. The top quark is expected to decay almost exclusively into a W boson and a bottom quark, so that the intermediate state of a tt event is W + bW \u2212b . Each of the two W bosons decays further into a charged lepton and a neutrino or into a quark-antiquark pair (multiple flavor and color assignments are possible), as illustrated in Figure 5. The quarks produced in W decays are not observed as such, but they hadronize producing jets of particles which are subsequently observed and measured in the detectors. At leading order, 10.6% of the tt events will have two charged leptons (e, \u00b5, \u03c4 ), two neutrinos and two jets; 43.9% of the final states will have one charged lepton, one neutrino and four jets, and 45.5% will have six jets. Neutrinos escape direct detection but their presence can be inferred via an excess of missing transverse energy in the event. While W \u2192 \u03bd decays, with = e or \u00b5, result in unambiguous experimental signatures, the case W \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd \u03c4 is more complicated as tau leptons subsequently decay in a variety of ways. According to the number of electrons and muons produced in the W decay chains, the final states (\"topologies\") of the tt system that lead to distinct experimental signatures are called \"dilepton\",\" +jets\", and \"all-hadronic\". Taking into account \u223c 35% leptonic decay branching fraction of the \u03c4 , only 6.4% of the events end up in the dilepton category. Similar considerations affect the +jets topology which accounts for 34.1% of the events when hadronic \u03c4 decays are excluded.  Measurements of branching fractions of top quark decays [36,37] have confirmed that the top quark decays predominantly into W b, as predicted by the SM. A number of decay modes of the top quark have been searched for and excluded: decay to a charged Higgs boson (at the level of 10%) and decays through Flavor Changing Neutral Currents (at the level of 10 \u22124 ), as summarized in the recent reviews [25,26].",

Jet energy measurements require precision calorimetry and good segmentation, as jet shapes play an important role both in the E T measurement and in disambiguation between quark and gluon jets (see Section 7.2). Hermeticity is essential for the E T measurement. High resolution tracking is also needed to identify bottom jets, in particular by reconstructing secondary vertices in jets.

The energy deposited in the EM and hadronic calorimeters by the muon is subject to requirements that are different for the two experiments. For muons produced in W decays, a calorimeter isolation as well as a track isolation is required in both experiments. Muons from cosmic rays are removed. The absolute energy calibration is obtained with Z \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 decays.",

The CDF jet energy resolution is approximately \u03c3(E T ) = (0.1 (E T /GeV) + 1.0) GeV for a 0.7 cone radius [45]. The detector response is simulated with the GFLASH parametrization [54] interfaced with GEANT3 [55]. Test beam data, in addition to pion and electron measurements from collider data [56], are used to tune the GFLASH parameters. The E/p distributions at several energies for pions and electrons are compared to the Monte Carlo expectation to obtain the tuning parameters. The jet energy scale is set by the 50 GeV/c test beam data point for pions and by the Z \u2192 e + e \u2212 collider data for electrons. The jets are corrected for nonlinear response of the calorimeter; poorly instrumented regions; \"multiple interactions\", i.e., the extra energy from the additional collisions occurring in the same bunch crossing (pile-up); \"underlying event\", i.e., the energy from the pp remnants; and \"out-of-cone\" energy. After tuning the simulation to the individual particle response, an \"absolute\" jet correction is derived from simulation. This correction is obtained by comparing the jet p T at the particle level to the jet p T after simulation. The same cone algorithm is used in both cases. The derived correction is valid if the number of tracks and the p T distribution of the tracks in data and in simulations are the same. This was verified using PYTHIA Monte Carlo (MC) samples with jet p T up to 600 GeV/c. The uncertainty of this procedure contributes 1% to the jet systematic uncertainty, independent of p T . Calibration, done in the central part of the detector (0.2 < |\u03b7| < 0.6), is extended to all the \u03b7 regions using a dijet imbalance algorithm. Systematic uncertainties arise from uncertainties on the corrections, stability of calorimeter response, calorimeter simulation for EM particles, and calorimeter simulation for hadrons.",

It is essential for suppressing backgrounds from QCD processes as well as for reducing the combinatorics in top events with high jet multiplicity.  The impact parameter resolution of the CDF tracking system is 35 \u00b5m for tracks with p T > 2 GeV/c [44]. D\u00d8 tracking provides impact parameter measurements with respect to the primary vertex with a precision between 20 and 50 \u00b5m, depending on the number of hits in the silicon detector [60]. The reconstruction of the secondary vertex follows a similar procedure for the CDF [61] and D\u00d8 [60] algorithms. A primary vertex for the event is reconstructed using tracks with a small impact parameter significance, d 0 /\u03c3 d0 < 3. The tracks in jets within a cone of \u2206R < 0.4 (CDF) or 0.5 (D\u00d8) and with large impact parameter significance d 0 /\u03c3 d0 > 3.5 are used to find a secondary vertex. Additional criteria are set for the significance of the L xy measurement. A jet is tagged as a heavy-flavor jet if all criteria, including a good fit of the secondary vertex, are met. The probability that the displaced vertex is produced by a charm jet is also evaluated, assessing the invariant mass of the tracks that form the secondary vertex. Both MC and data samples are used to evaluate the efficiency of the tagger in top events and the mistag rate, i.e., the probability that a light quark jet is tagged as a heavy flavor jet. The CDF b-tagging efficiency as a function of jet E T is shown in Figure 11  [62]. The efficiency for a \"tight\" b-tagging requirement used for the top mass measurements is about 40%. The mistag rate is increasing from 0.4% at 15 GeV to 2.3% at 180 GeV.  Figure 11. The CDF b-tag efficiency for \"tight\" and \"loose\" b-tagging requirements [62].

These neural network (NN) algorithms help reduce the background from light quark jets that mimic heavy flavor jets. The CDF algorithm [63] employs other variables in addition to secondary vertex information, but has not been used for top mass measurements. The D\u00d8 NN algorithm [64] was used for top mass measurements. It takes into account information from impact parameter measurements, the secondary vertex tagger, and the soft lepton tagger (SLT). The SLT attempts to identify semileptonic decays within a jet. Separate efficiencies for b and c quark jets as a function of p T and \u03b7 are obtained, and the mistag rate as a function of the same variables is evaluated [64]. The NN is trained on QCD bb jets and on light quark Monte Carlo samples, and its performance is measured in data. Figure 12 shows the fake (mistag) rate-vs-efficiency for jets in two different regions of p T and \u03b7. ",

Modeling of physics backgrounds is discussed in Section 4.2. Instrumental backgrounds are caused by misidentification of charged leptons, neutrinos ( E T ), or b jets. These backgrounds can be reduced by stringent requirements on particle identification criteria (charged leptons), topological cuts for the E T (neutrinos), and sophisticated algorithms for b-tagging.",

This background is further classified into W +light flavor and W +heavy flavor. The first one can be reduced considerably by requiring one or more jets to be tagged as a b jet. Another large background (often called non-W QCD) is due to multijet production, where a jet fakes an electron or a muon. Rate estimations for these backgrounds are performed with data driven methods, developed for top cross section measurements. Details can be found in [67,24] for the CDF analyses and in [64] for D\u00d8 analyses. A good review of these methods can be found in [25]. Other instrumental backgrounds are due to mismeasurements of jets which occur in poorly instrumented regions of the detector and increase the value of E T . Requiring a certain minimum angle between the jet and the E T direction helps to suppress these backgrounds. Finally, diboson production, i.e., W W , W Z and ZZ final states with the same topology as tt, and single top production also contribute to the background. The dependence of the background rate on the number of b-tagged jets can be seen in Figure 13. See Section 7.1 for the contributions of each of these backgrounds to the candidate event samples after application of all selection requirements. the number of tagged jets in the +jets topology for events with at least four energetic jets [68].",

In the dilepton channel there are fewer events but the S/B ratio is good even without b-tagging. Tagging of b-jets can help increase the S/B ratio even further.

Charged leptons in decays of W bosons are produced in association with neutrinos. Lepton presence, while allowing for powerful discrimination of QCD background, leads to complications in the reconstruction of event kinematics due to undetected neutrinos. We assume for the moment that the four-momenta of all charged final state partons are reasonably well measured, that masses of initial state partons and final state neutrinos are zero, that the transverse momentum of the incoming partons is zero, and that all of the event transverse missing energy is taken away by escaping neutrinos. With these assumptions, the neutrino 3-momenta and the longitudinal components of the momentum of the incoming partons are the only kinematical quantities not known, and then the total number of additional kinematic constraints needed in order to completely specify the reaction is 2 + 3n \u03bd , where n \u03bd is the number of neutrinos in the final state. Four of these constraints come from the energy-momentum conservation, and three additional constraints can be introduced by using the narrow width approximation for top and W : the invariant masses of the W decay products are required to be consistent with the mass of the W and the invariant masses of top decay products are set to M t . M t itself is considered unknown, so the latter requirement generates only one effective constraint for the two top quarks present in the process. With these seven constraints, the total number of kinematical degrees of freedom (DoF) is 3n \u03bd \u2212 5. This gives 1 DoF for the dilepton final state, \u22122 for +jets (the system is overconstrained), and \u22125 for the allhadronic channel. This indicates that kinematic fitting techniques based on \u03c7 2 minimization can be utilized for the analysis of both +jets and all-hadronic final states. In the dilepton channel kinematical equations are underconstrained, so this channel has to be treated in a substantially different manner.

In this approach, weights are assigned to all m t values in each event according to the \u03bdWT algorithm (see Section 5.3 for the description of this procedure). In this algorithm, the tt production and decay processes are not modeled in sufficient detail and background contamination is not accounted for, so in practice the weights can not be treated as m t likelihoods. Instead, a method has been developed in which the probability of the complete m t weight distribution is estimated for each event as a function of M t . For the purpose of dimensionality reduction, the normalized weight curve is split into N b bins, weights are integrated in each bin, and the (N b \u22121)-dimensional vector of integrated weights is used as y (due to the imposed normalization, N b \u2212 1 weights are independent). According to [127], this approach improves the statistical sensitivity of the measurement by \u224825% in comparison with m t templates.",

In (2), Gaussian resolution functions are employed for magnitudes of all transverse momenta, missing energy, as well as for the mass constraints. The method does not take into account angular resolutions of lepton and jet directions (these directions are assumed to be perfectly measured), asymmetry of jet p T resolution functions, or expected event population in the reaction phase space. The \u03c7 2 is minimized with respect to all parton-level kinematic quantities (magnitudes of the transverse momenta of b and light quarks, 3-momentum of the neutrino) as well as m t . This minimization is performed separately for all jet-to-parton assignments (permutations) consistent with the observed set of b tags. Typically, two solutions are obtained in the +jets channel when kinematic equations are solved for the t \u2192 W b \u2192 \u03bd b decay sequence, thus increasing the number of effective permutations by a factor of two. The value of m t at the \u03c7 2 minimum over all permutations and parton-level kinematic variables is usually taken as the top mass estimate for the event. Distributions of the \u03c7 2 minimum values are illustrated in Figure 18 for the +jets channel.",

It would be possible to infer m t if at least one additional kinematic quantity or constraint was available. This suggests the following method of m t determination: values of some unobserved kinematic quantities \u03be are assumed, kinematic equations are solved, and allowed values of top mass, m t (\u03be, y), are determined (in addition to \u03be, m t (\u03be, y) depends on some or all quantities y measured in the detector). \u03be values are scanned within their kinematic limits. Obtained m t (\u03be, y) values are assigned weights proportional to the probability density, \u03c1(\u03b6), of some other kinematic quantities \u03b6(\u03be, y) (variable sets \u03be and \u03b6 may overlap partially, completely, or not at all). \u03c1(\u03b6) is determined in advance, either from theoretical considerations or by estimating this density numerically using large samples of Monte Carlo events. While it is not strictly necessary, this method operates in the most transparent manner if \u03c1(\u03b6) has little or no dependence on M t . The distribution of possible m t values, \u03c1(m t ), is thus formed, proportional to \u03c1(\u03b6(\u03be, y)) \u03b4(m t (\u03be, y) \u2212 m t ) d\u03be. The location parameter of this distribution (usually the mode) is used as the top mass estimate for this particular event. This approach is very general, and a judicious choice of A very similar approach, albeit without proper normalization, is discussed in [141].  Figure 19.

These studies include [148,149] in the +jets channel and [106,87,105,113] in the all-hadronic channel. An advanced investigation of the effect of background suppression on the precision of M t measurement in the dilepton channel has been carried out in [160]. In this study, a neural network with six input variables was directly optimized for the best statistical uncertainty of the M t estimator. The estimator itself was obtained by MEM in which the background probability was calculated for the Z/\u03b3 * + 2 jets and W W + 2 jets production as well as for jets faking leptons in W + 3 jets. The NN optimization algorithm (neuroevolution) allowed for modification of both NN topology and weights. As a result, the space of potential selection requirements was explored in considerable detail. Counter to prior expectations, the best discriminator permitted a significant fraction of background events (about 65%) to remain in the sample. The loose selection resulted in \u224820% improvement in the a priori statistical uncertainty in comparison with the previous dilepton sample definition employed in [151].",

This requirement discriminates the signal not only against the background but also against tt events in which an incorrect set of jets was selected to form the tt system (this can happen, for example, due to a presence of an energetic initial state radiation jet). Several distinct approaches can be employed in order to form a consistent M t estimate. One can fall back onto the template method [117], adjust the likelihood so that the background contribution is removed on average [148,149] + , or just correct for background presence in the calibration procedure [157].

The other approaches can function in signal-dominated samples due to an important feature of the Breit-Wigner mass shape of the top quark (which limits the M t resolution that can be achieved in a single event even by a perfect detector): the slope of its log-likelihood is bounded. Because of this, any noise event, no matter how far away from the signal, can have only a limited impact on the estimate. In other words, if the MEM analysis does not employ the narrow width approximation for the top quark, the maximum likelihood estimate of M t is guaranteed to be robust and can tolerate certain deficiencies in the background modeling.",

The assumptions built into such descriptions, combined with the limited amount of available data, result in biased point estimators of M t and/or incorrect interval estimator coverage prior to calibration. Fortunately, the consequences of such model misspecifications can be studied by testing the estimator performance with artificial event samples produced by combinations of physics Monte Carlo generators and detector simulation packages. The problem of the M t estimator calibration is thereby split into two parts which could be analyzed independently: derivation of corrections with simulated samples and characterization of the differences between simulated samples and observed data.",

As the top quark and W bosons decay quickly on the timescale associated with the parton shower and fragmentation processes (i.e., 1/\u0393 t , 1/\u0393 W 1/\u039b QCD ), it is possible that the decay products from the different top quarks interact with each other via color reconnections. Color reconnection effects were first investigated at LEP [169] as a possible source of systematic uncertainty in precision measurements of the W mass in W W events; no evidence of color reconnections was found in these studies. The partons emerging from the Tevatron pp initial state carry color charge, thus phenomenological color reconnection modeling is significantly more complicated than for the e + e \u2212 initial state at LEP. Recently, a new version of PYTHIA (v6.4) with improved description of parton shower (p T -ordered), multiple parton interactions, underlying event, and color reconnection (CR) effects has been released [170] and subsequently tuned to collider data [81]. The CR systematic uncertainty is calculated as the difference between the M t estimators obtained with the event samples generated by PYTHIA 6.4 tune \"A-pro\" and PYTHIA 6.4 tune \"ACR-pro\". These tunes differ in the color reconnection model but use the same mass-ordered parton shower model as the one used in the default PYTHIA 6.2. This approach was cross-checked with the p T -ordered parton shower, and compatible top mass difference was found. The difference between the mass-ordered and the p T -ordered parton shower prescriptions is not taken into account in the signal systematics, as preliminary versions of the latter did not match CDF jet shape evolution [171]. More studies of the p T -ordered parton shower model are in progress.",

The challenges are reduction of the very large QCD background due to multijet production and reduction of the 90 possible permutations that can be made in assigning 2 jets to b quarks and pairing the remaining 4 jets. Dedicated trigger requirements are needed in order to enhance the top quark signal contribution over the overwhelming background. Even after surviving such trigger requirements, the background is about three orders of magnitude larger than the signal. In order to reconstruct the tt events, at least six high-p T jets must be present in the detector, while charged and neutral leptons are vetoed.

Therefore, the tt event selection criteria in the +jets and dilepton channels actually accept a fraction of events which contain leptonically decaying taus. On the other hand, explicit identification of tau leptons which decay hadronically is difficult: these decays resemble common hadronic jets originating from quarks and gluons. For this reason, hadronic tau identification algorithms typically have to operate at low efficiency. For signals with many jets in the final state, as the tt decays under consideration here, the explicit tau identification is often not sufficient to suppress the QCD background in the sample. One can instead rely upon the experimental signature characterized by multiple jets and large E T in the final state as an efficient way to collect the tt events with tau leptons.",

This feature is exploited in the recent CDF M t measurement [118]. The kinematic analysis starts by identifying decay products of the hadronically decaying W . All pairwise combinations of jets without b tags are considered, and the pair which gives the invariant mass closest to the world average W mass is chosen. Then the jet with the highest E T is chosen among the remaining jets and added to the pair in order to construct a 3-jet system whose invariant mass is correlated with the top quark mass. Another such system is built by adding the jet with the second highest E T to the pair. 3-dimensional templates are constructed using the di-jet and the two tri-jet invariant masses.",

While the sensitivity of such variables to the calorimeter hadronic jet energy scale calibration is indeed minimal, reliance upon manifestly non-Lorentz invariant quantities has its own disadvantages. Both variables are highly sensitive to the mismodeling of parton distribution functions which affect typical center-of-mass energies and therefore average boosts of parent top quarks. The sensitivity to the uncertainties in background shape and composition is also increased. In addition, the L xy distributions in Monte Carlo are strongly affected by the b jet fragmentation model, while the lepton p T measurements suffer from imprecise energy scale calibration of the electromagnetic calorimeter. On the other hand, the L xybased estimate is essentially complementary to all other methods of top mass determination, and constitutes an independent source of information about M t (the same can not be said about lepton p T which is used either explicitly or implicitly by kinematic fitting and matrix element techniques).",

The efficiency to \"tag\" a tt event passing typical +jets event selection criteria by finding a soft muon produced in a decay of a b quark is about 14% [194].

The average M \u00b5 of the selected sample depends approximately linearly on M t , as illustrated in Figure 32. In this analysis, the dominant components of the systematic uncertainty are due to imprecise knowledge of the background shape and fraction in the M \u00b5 template (\u03c3 bg = 1.9 GeV/c 2 , statistically limited by the size of the available event sample) and due to uncertainties in signal modeling, especially b jet fragmentation, conservatively estimated by comparing M t estimates obtained for event samples generated by HERWIG [69] and PYTHIA [17] ",

A number of sophisticated M t measurement techniques have been developed. Important methodological advances include the first practical application of the matrix element analysis method to hadron collider data and introduction of the in situ jet energy scale calibration with the W boson mass. These particular improvements led to a substantial reduction in the statistical and systematic uncertainty, respectively. Recent M t measurements performed in different final states of the tt system, with multiple analysis methods and with independent experimental setups are all in close agreement with each other, in accordance with Standard Model expectations.",

If, after sorting, M 0 t lies between M \u2212 t and M + t then the estimator systematic uncertainty associated with this source is taken to be |M + t \u2212 M \u2212 t |/2. If, on the other hand, M 0 t ends up outside the interval defined by the M \u2212 t and M + t endpoints then the uncertainty is evaluated as max(|M + t \u2212 M 0 t |/2, |M \u2212 t \u2212 M 0 t |/2). The main advantage of this method is its simplicity. It works well on average if the M t estimator can be reasonably expected to change linearly as a function of the nuisance parameter and if the |M + t \u2212 M \u2212 t | shift is much larger than the statistical uncertainty of the M + t or M \u2212 t determination. \u2022 Instead of generating three separate simulated samples, an event reweighting scheme is applied to the 0\u03c3 sample in such a manner that the effective value of the parameter under study is shifted in either direction while other parameters are kept intact. The changes in the M t estimator response are processed as in the previous method. While designing such a reweighting scheme can be a complicated problem in itself, this technique can be used to study very small systematic shifts because the statistical uncertainty of the M + t and M \u2212 t determination mostly cancels out in the M + t \u2212 M \u2212 t difference.",
