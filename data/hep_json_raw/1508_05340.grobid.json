We use the direction of the charged particle with the largest transverse momentum in each event to define three regions of \u03b7-\u03c6 space; \"toward\", \"away\", and \"transverse\". The average number and the average scalar p T sum of charged particles in the transverse region are sensitive to the modeling of the \"underlying event\". The transverse region is divided into a MAX and MIN transverse region, which helps separate the \"hard component\" (initial and final-state radiation) from the \"beam-beam remnant\" and multiple parton interaction components of the scattering. The center-of-mass energy dependence of the various components of the event are studied in detail. The data presented here can be used to constrain and improve QCD Monte Carlo models, resulting in more precise predictions at the LHC energies of 13 and 14 TeV.",

Three distinct processes contribute to the inelastic cross section: single diffraction, double-diffraction, and everything else (referred to as \"non-diffractive\"). For elastic scattering neither of the beam particles break apart (i.e., color singlet exchange). For single and double diffraction one or both of the beam particles are excited into a high-mass color-singlet state (i.e., N* states) which then decay. Single and double diffraction also correspond to color singlet exchange between the beam hadrons. When color is exchanged, the outgoing remnants are no longer color singlets and one has a separation of color resulting in a multitude of quark-antiquark pairs being produced out of the vacuum. The non-diffractive component, \u03c3 ND , involves color exchange and the separation of color, and has both a soft and hard component. Most of the time the color exchange between partons in the beam hadrons occurs through a soft interaction (i.e., no high transverse momentum) and the two beam hadrons move through each other producing soft particles with a uniform distribution in rapidity together with many particles at small angles to the beam. Occasionally, there is a hard scattering among the constituent partons producing outgoing particles and \"jets\" with high transverse momentum.",

The Collider Detector at Fermilab (CDF) MB online event selection (i.e., trigger) requires at least one charged particle in the forward region 3.2 < \u03b7 < 5.9 and simultaneously at least one charged particle in the backward region -5.9 < \u03b7 < -3.2, where the pseudorapidity \u03b7 = -log(tan(\u03b8 cm /2)) and \u03b8 cm is the center-ofmass scattering angle with respect to the proton beam direction. The underlying event (UE) consists of the beam-beam remnants (BBR) and the multiple parton interactions (MPI) that accompany a hard scattering [1]. The UE is an unavoidable background to hard-scattering collider events. To study the UE we use MB data, however, MB and UE observables receive contributions from quite different sources. The majority of MB collisions are soft, while the UE is studied in events in which a hard scattering has occurred. One uses the topological structure of the hard hadron-hadron collision to study the UE experimentally. As illustrated in Fig. 1, on an event-by-event basis, a \"leading object\" is used to define regions of \u03b7-\u03c6 space, where \u03b7 is the pseudorapidity and \u03c6 is the azimuthal scattering angle. In Run 1 at CDF we looked at charged particles and used the highest-transverse-momentum charged-particle jet as the leading object [2]. Later in Run 2 we studied the UE using the highest-transverse-energy calorimeter jet as the leading object, and also used the lepton-pair in Z-boson production for the leading object [3]. Here we study charged particles and, as shown in Fig. 2, we use the highest transverse momentum charged particle in the event as the leading object.",

The CDF detector can measure charged particles in the region |\u03b7| < 1.1, however, in order to compare directly with LHC UE data in this analysis we restrict ourselves to \u03b7 cut = 0.8. Furthermore, the events considered are required to contain at least one charged particle with p T > 0.5 GeV/c and |\u03b7| < 0.8. We begin by looking at the average overall total number of charged particles and the pseudorapidity distribution of the charged particles. We then examine how the average overall total number of charged particles depends on the center-of-mass energy and on the transverse momentum of the leading charged particle, PTmax. Then, we study the \"associated\" charged particle and charged PTsum densities, where PTsum is the scalar p T sum of the charged particles. Densities are formed by dividing by the corresponding area in \u03b7-\u03c6 space. For the overall associated density the area is \u0394\u03b7\u0394\u03c6 = 2\u03b7 cut \u00d72\u03c0.

As shown in Fig. 2, on an event by event basis, we define transMAX (transMIN) to be the transverse region (1 or 2) having the maximum (minimum) of either the number of charged particles, or scalar p T sum of charged particles, depending on the quantity under study. Again densities are formed by dividing by the area in \u03b7-\u03c6 space, where the transMAX and transMIN regions each have an area of \u0394\u03b7\u0394\u03c6 = 2\u03b7 cut \u00d72\u03c0/6. Hence, the transverse density (also referred to as \"transAVE\") is the average of the transMAX and the transMIN densities. For events with large initial or final-state radiation the transMAX region often contains the third jet, while both the transMAX and transMIN regions receive contributions from the MPI and BBR components. Thus, the observables in the transMIN region are more sensitive to the MPI and BBR components of the UE, while the \"transDIF\" observables (transMAX minus the transMIN) are more sensitive to initial-state radiation (ISR) and final-state radiation (FSR) [4]. QCD Monte Carlo generators such as PYTHIA [5] have parameters which may be adjusted to control the behavior of their event modeling. A specified set of these parameters that has been adjusted to better fit some aspects of the data is referred to as a \"tune\" [6][7][8]. The CDF PYTHIA 6.2 Tune A was determined by fitting the CDF Run 1 UE data [2] and the PYTHIA 6.2 Tune DW does a good job in describing both the CDF Run 1 and Run 2 UE data [3]. However, Tune DW does not reproduce perfectly all the features of the LHC data. After the LHC data became available, improved LHC UE tunes were constructed [9,10]. Tune Z1 and Tune Z2* are PYTHIA 6.4 tunes that were constructed by fitting CMS UE data at 900 GeV and 7 TeV [11].",

Tracking systems are designed to detect charged particles and measure their momenta and displacements from the point of collision, termed the primary interaction vertex. The tracking system consists of a silicon microstrip system (not used for this analysis) and an open-cell wire drift chamber, the latter called the Central Outer Tracker (COT) that surrounds the silicon. The positive z-axis is defined to lie along the incident proton beam direction. We use all the 300 GeV and 900 GeV MB data resulting from a dedicated data-taking period in which the collider was operated at reduced energy (referred to as the \"Tevatron Energy Scan\"). At 1.96 TeV we include the 2 fb -1 of Run 2 MB data that was taken before January 30, 2007, where the instantaneous luminosity was not large so that the pile-up corrections are small (see Sec. II.3). In order to estimate the systematic uncertainties, at each of the three energies we consider two different vertex selection criteria.

The COT [16] is a cylindrical open-cell drift chamber with 96 sense wire layers grouped into eight alternating superlayers of stereo and axial wires. Its active volume covers 40 < r < 137 cm, where r is the radial coordinate in the plane transverse to the z axis, and |z| < 155 cm, thus providing fiducial coverage in |\u03b7| \u2264 1.1 to tracks originating within |z| \u2264 60 cm. We include tracks in the region 0.5 < p T < 150 GeV/c and |\u03b7| < 0.8, where the COT has an efficiency greater than 90%. At higher values of p T the track momentum resolution deteriorates. The upper limit of 150 GeV/c is chosen to prevent mis-measured tracks with very high p T from distorting the average charged-particle density and the average charged-particle PTsum density. Tracks are required to be reconstructed with COT signals from at least 10 axial wires from two axial segments and 10 stereo wires from 2 stereo segments. In addition, the tracks are required to point back to the primary vertex in the event. In order to estimate the systematic uncertainties, we employ both a \"loose\" and a \"tight\" track selection criterion. The loose track selection requires |d 0 | < 1.0 cm and |z -z vertex | < \u0394Z cut = 3.0 cm, where d 0 is the beam corrected transverse impact parameter and z -z vertex is the distance on the z-axis (beam axis) between the track projection and the primary vertex. The tight track selection requires that |d 0 | < 0.5 cm and |zz vertex | < \u0394Z cut = 2.0 cm. This is identical to our previous Run 2 UE analysis [3]. For both the tight and loose cases the transverse impact parameter is corrected for the beam position. For events with no high-quality vertex we require |z -z max | < 2\u0394Z cut , where z -z max is the longitudinal distance between the measured track and the highest-p T track (i.e., leading track).",

Tracks are required to point back to the primary vertex, but the track observables are affected by pile-up when two vertices overlap. Vertices within about 3.0 cm of each other merge together as one. Large instantaneous luminosity implies more pile-up. The data in each PTmax bin are plotted versus the instantaneous luminosity and fit to a straight line. This function is then used to correct the data for pile-up on an event-by-event basis. The value of every bin of the plots at 1.96 TeV have been corrected for pile-up. In all cases the pile-up corrections are less than 4%. The instantaneous luminosities at 300 GeV and 900 GeV are so small that there is no need for pile-up corrections of the data.",

            "text": "The charged tracks measured in the CDF detector are corrected to the stable-particle level using the same bin-by-bin method we used in our previous Run 2 UE analysis [3]. We rely on PYTHIA Tune A and the CDF detector simulation CDFSIM (parameterized response of the CDF II detector [17,18]) to correct the measured tracks back to the prompt stable charged particle level. Particles are considered stable if c\u03c4 > 10 mm (i.e., K s , \u039b, \u03a3, \u039e, and \u03a9 are considered stable). PYTHIA Tune A is used to calculate the observables in Table 1 at the particle level in bins of the highest-p T charged particle (GEN) and at the detector level in bins of the highest-p T track (CDFSIM). The detector-level data in bins of the highest-p T track are corrected by multiplying by the correction factor, GEN/CDFSIM. Smooth curves are drawn through the QCD Monte Carlo predictions at both the generator level (GEN) and the detector level (CDFSIM) to aid in comparing the theory with the data and also to construct the correction factors. Correction factors for every bin of every observable in Table 1 are constructed for each of the three data sets (T01, L01, and T1) at the three center-of-mass energies: 1.96 TeV, 900 GeV, and 300 GeV. At 1.96 TeV correction factors are constructed after correcting for pile-up. The correction factors depend on the p T of the leading charged particle, PTmax. For the T01 and L01 data sets the corrections are less than 10% for all values of PTmax. For PTmax > 2 GeV/c the corrections to the T1 data set are less than 10%, but at low PTmax values the corrections are around 20%. The data presented here correspond to the corrected T01 data set. The corrected T1 and L01 data sets are used to estimate the systematic uncertainties. The data points are plotted at the center of the bins.",

            "text": "The three datasets (T01, L01, and T1) are each corrected to the particle level using their corresponding correction factors. If PYTHIA Tune A fit the data perfectly and if the detector simulation (CDFSIM) were perfect, then the corrected data from the three data sets would be identical. The differences among the three corrected datasets are used to estimate the systematic uncertainties. The first systematic uncertainty (sys1) is a measure of how well CDFSIM simulates the difference between the loose and tight track selection (bin-by-bin difference between the corrected data sets L01 and T01). The second (sys2) is a measure of how well CDFSIM simulates the difference in including or excluding events with zero high-quality vertices (bin-by-bin difference between the corrected data sets T1 and T01). The third (sys3 = 2%) is included to take into account the accuracy of constructing the smooth theory curves that are used to construct the response and correction factors. The overall total uncertainty results from adding the statistical error in quadrature with the three systematic uncertainties: sys1, sys2, and sys3. At low PTmax values the overall error is dominated by sys2, while at large PTmax the overall error is predominately statistical. Figure 3 shows the data on the pseudorapidity distribution, dN/d\u03b7, for charged particles with |\u03b7| < 0.8 and p T > 0.5 GeV/c and p T > 1.0 GeV/c for events with at least one charged particle with |\u03b7| < 0.8 and p T > 0.5 GeV/c and p T > 1.0 GeV/c, respectively, compared with PYTHIA Tune Z1 [19]. The pseudorapidity distribution is shown for both p T > 0.5 GeV/c and p T > 1.0 GeV/c in order to test if the models give the correct transverse-momentum distribution of the charged particles, and as can be seen in Fig. 3, the data have a slightly steeper p T distribution than does Tune Z1. The data on the pseudorapidity distribution, dN/d\u03b7, at \u03b7 = 0 plotted versus the center-of-mass energy are also shown. The pseudorapidity distribution increases slowly with energy and PYTHIA Tune Z1 describes the rise with energy fairly well. The dN/d\u03b7 distributions correspond to the average number of charged particles per unit \u03b7 and are normalized so that the integral is equal to the overall average number of charged particles with |\u03b7| < 0.8 and p T > 0.5 GeV/c and with |\u03b7| < 0.8 and p T > 1.0 GeV/c for events with at least one charged particle with |\u03b7| < 0.8 and p T > 0.5 GeV/c and p T > 1.0 GeV/c, respectively, as follows:  In constructing dN/d\u03b7 we require Nchg \u2265 1 and include all p T values greater than 0.5 GeV/c of the leading charged particle. This is exactly the same set of charged particles that are included in our study of the UE. To study the UE, however, we look at the number and PTsum of the charged particles in the transverse region as a function of the transverse momentum of the leading charged particle. Table 2. Data at 1.96 TeV, 900 GeV, and 300 GeV on the average overall number of charged particles and the average overall density of charged particle with |\u03b7| < 0.8 and p T > 0.5 GeV/c for events with at least one charged particle with |\u03b7| < 0.8 and p T > 0.5 GeV/c. The data are corrected to the particle level with errors that include both the statistical error and the systematic uncertainty.  Table 2 shows the data on the average overall number of charged particles and the average overall density of charged particles with |\u03b7| < 0.8 and p T > 0.5 GeV/c for events with at least one charged particle with |\u03b7| < 0.8 and p T > 0.5 GeV/c. The data are corrected to the particle level with errors that include both the statistical error and the systematic uncertainty. The overall density is computed by dividing by 1.6 \u00d7 2\u03c0. The average overall number of charged particles increases by 50% from 2.24 at 300 GeV to 3.44 at 1.96 TeV.   E,F) on the average overall number of charged particles with |\u03b7| < 0.8 and p T > 0.5 GeV/c (including the leading charged particle) for events with at least one charged particle with |\u03b7| < 0.8 and p T > 0.5 GeV/c plotted versus the transverse momentum of the leading charged particle, PTmax. The horizontal dashed lines correspond to the average overall number of charged particles with |\u03b7| < 0.8 and p T > 0.5 GeV/c for events with at least one charged particle with |\u03b7| < 0.8 and p T > 0.5 GeV/c if one includes all PTmax values (see Table 2). The data are corrected to the particle level with errors that include both the statistical error and the systematic uncertainty, and are compared with PYTHIA Tune Z1 and Z2* (A,C,E) and PYTHIA Tune Z2* and 4C* (B,D,F). Figure 4 compares the average overall number of charged particles from Table 2 with the average overall number of charged particles with |\u03b7| < 0.8 and p T > 0.5 GeV/c (including the highest-p T charged particle) for events with at least one charged particle with |\u03b7| < 0.8 and p T > 0.5 GeV/c plotted versus the transverse momentum of the leading charged particle, PTmax. The average overall number of charged particles in Table 2 corresponds to including all PTmax values. As one would expect the overall average number of charged particles increases as PTmax increases. For example at 1.96 TeV the overall average number of charged particles is 3.44 if one includes all PTmax values, and events with PTmax \u2248 10 GeV/c have, on the average, roughly 10 charged particles. This observable is sensitive to the overall structure of the event.",

            "text": "Figures 8 and 9 compare the charged particle density and the charged PTsum density, respectively, in the toward and away regions at the three center-of-mass energies; 1.96 TeV, 900 GeV, and 300 GeV. The charge particle and PTsum densities in the toward region behave differently than they do in the away region, as the center-of-mass energy increases. The UE contributes to the toward and away regions, however, these regions are dominated by hard-scattered jets. The toward region observables measure the number and PTsum of the charged particles accompanying the leading charged particle. The jet in the toward region is not an average jet. It is a jet in which almost all the momentum of the jet is taken by one charged particle. In order to describe this region the QCD Monte Carlo models must describe well the z \u2248 1 region of the fragmentation function, where z is the fraction of the overall jet momentum carried by a single charged particle. At 300 GeV the PTmax distribution is very steep and the probability of having a leading charged particle with, for example, PTmax \u2248 10 GeV/c is small. The QCD Monte Carlo models describe this by producing a parton with transverse momentum just slightly higher than 10 GeV/c which fragments into a charged particle carrying almost all the momentum of the parton (z \u2248 1), resulting in very few accompanying jet particles. At 1.96 TeV the PTmax distribution is not as steep and there is a higher probability of having a leading charged particle with PTmax \u2248 10 GeV/c. Here the fraction of the jet momentum carried by the leading charged particle is not as high, and hence there are more accompanying jet particles.

When it is in this region then the away region observables are dominated by the away-side jet. When it is not, then the away region observables are dominated by ISR, FSR, and the UE. The probability that the away-side jet is in the central region is a function of both PTmax and the center-of-mass energy. For PTmax \u2248 10 GeV/c it is more likely that the away-side jet is central at 300 GeV than at 1.96 TeV. At large PTmax values at 300 GeV the charge particle and PTsum densities are larger in the away region than they are in the toward region. At 900 GeV they are roughly the same, and at 1.96 TeV the densities in the toward region are larger than they are in the away region. The QCD Monte Carlo model tunes do a good job in describing the qualitative behavior of the observables in the toward and away regions. There is a tendency for the tunes to produce too much associated density in the toward region.",

Figures 12 and 13 show the CDF data on the charged particle density and PTsum density, respectively, for transAVE and transDIF as a function of PTmax. The transAVE density is the average of the transMAX and transMIN densities, while the transDIF density is the transMAX density minus the transMIN density. The transverse density shown in Figs. 6 and 7 corresponds to the transAVE density. Figures 14 and 15 show data on the transMAX and transMIN charged particle density and charged PTsum density, respectively, as defined by the leading charged particle, for 5.0 < PTmax < 6.0 GeV/c plotted versus the center-of-mass energy. For PTmax < 5.0 GeV/c, the UE observables in the transverse region increase rapidly as PTmax increases, while for PTmax > 5.0 GeV/c they increase slowly with increasing PTmax (i.e., the \"plateau\" region). The bin 5.0 < PTmax < 6.0 GeV/c is selected since it corresponds to the beginning of the \"plateau\" region. Figures 16 and 17 show data on the transAVE and transDIF charged particle density and charged PTsum density, respectively, plotted versus the center-of-mass energy. These figures also show the ratio of the data at 1.96 TeV, 900 GeV, and 300 GeV to the corresponding value at 300 GeV. All four densities, MAX, MIN, AVE, and DIF have different center-of-mass energy dependences and the QCD Monte Carlo model tunes do a remarkably good job in describing the general features of these four observables. Figure 18 compares the energy dependence of the transMIN and transDIF components. The data show that the transMIN charged particle and charged PTsum density increase by a factor of 2.8 and 3.2, respectively, in going from 300 GeV to 1.96 TeV, while the transDIF charged particle and charged PTsum density increases by only a factor of 1.6 and 1.8, respectively. The transMIN density (more sensitive to MPI & BBR) increases much faster with center-of-mass energy than does the transDIF density (more sensitive to ISR & FSR). The MPI increases like a power of the center-of-mass energy (or a power of the log of the energy), while the ISR & FSR increase logarithmically. This is the first time we have seen the different energy dependences of these two components. Previously we only had information on the energy dependence of the transAVE density. The QCD Monte Carlo tunes do a fairly good (although not perfect) job in describing the energy dependence of transMIN and transDIF.  Figure 12. Data at 1.96 TeV, 900 GeV, and 300 GeV on the charged particle density (p T > 0.5 GeV/c, |\u03b7| < 0.8) for transAVE = (transMAX+transMIN)/2 (A,B) and transDIF = transMAX-transMIN (C,D) as defined by the leading charged particle, as a function of the p T of the leading charged particle, PTmax. The data are corrected to the particle level with errors that include both the statistical error and the systematic uncertainty, and are compared with PYTHIA Tune Z1 and Z2* (A,C) and PYTHIA Tune Z2* and 4C* (B,D).   2 (A,B) and transDIF = transMAX-transMIN (C,D) as defined by the leading charged particle, as a function of the p T of the leading charged particle, PTmax. The data are corrected to the particle level with errors that include both the statistical error and the systematic uncertainty, and are compared with PYTHIA Tune Z1 and Z2* (A,C) and PYTHIA Tune Z2* and 4C* (B,D). Figure 19 shows the data on the charged-particle average p T in the transverse region as defined by the leading charged particle, as a function of the p T of the leading charged particle, PTmax. Figure 19 also shows the transverse charged particle average p T for 5.0 < PTmax < 6.0 GeV/c plotted versus the center-of-mass energy. The transverse average p T increases slowly with center-of-mass energy and this slow rise is correctly predicted by the QCD Monte Carlo model tunes. However, all the tunes predict an average p T that is slightly less than that seen in the data over most of the PTmax range. The average p T is a measure to the p T distribution of charged particles and the tunes predict a p T distribution that is slightly too soft.",
