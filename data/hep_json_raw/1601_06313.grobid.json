            "text": "The MINERvA collaboration reports a novel study of neutrino-nucleus charged-current deep inelastic scattering (DIS) using the same neutrino beam incident on targets of polystyrene, graphite, iron, and lead. Results are presented as ratios of C, Fe, and Pb to CH. The ratios of total DIS cross sections as a function of neutrino energy and flux-integrated differential cross sections as a function of the Bjorken scaling variable x are presented in the neutrino-energy range of 5 \u2212 50 GeV. Based on the predictions of charged-lepton scattering ratios, good agreement is found between the data and prediction at medium x and low neutrino energy. However, the ratios appear to be below predictions in the vicinity of the nuclear shadowing region, x < 0.1. This apparent deficit, reflected in the DIS cross-section ratio at high E\u03bd , is consistent with previous MINERvA observations [1] and with the predicted onset of nuclear shadowing with the the axial-vector current in neutrino scattering. Deep inelastic scattering (DIS) has played an important role in the history of physics [2]. Starting with the confirmation of the quark parton model [3], high-energy DIS experiments, mainly using charged leptons (muons and electrons) as probes, have been essential tools in understanding parton dynamics [4]. These experiments have also contributed to the development of perturba-tive Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) that describes the quark and gluon content of the nucleon over a broad kinematic regime.",

In charged-lepton experiments E had is typically replaced by \u03bd, the energy loss of the incident lepton. As this energy loss cannot be measured directly in a neutrino beam, E had is used as an estimator. Four distinct effects have been identified in the ratios of total DIS and differential DIS cross sections per nucleon on heavy nuclei such as iron, gold and calcium [7], to those on deuterium. At x 0.1, \"shadowing\" depletes the bound cross section [8], while anti-shadowing produces a compensating increase for 0.1 x 0.3 [9]. The EMC effect in the region 0.3 x 0.75 reduces the bound cross section, and Fermi motion, dominant at x 0.75, causes a sharp enhancement of the bound cross section [12]. Nuclear shadowing and Fermi motion are fairly well understood theoretically and experimentally. Anti-shadowing is assumed to compensate the dips in the shadowing and EMC region. However, the EMC effect currently has no widely-accepted theoretical origin [13].",

To date no partonic nuclear effects, similar to those measured for charged-lepton DIS, have been directly measured due to the difficulty in combining data sets with different neutrino fluxes, acceptances, thresholds, and resolutions. The analyses that do exist measure neutrino DIS in heavy nuclei such as Fe [14][15][16][17], Ne [18], and Pb [19]. Comparing measurements in heavy nuclei to free-nucleon calculations in an attempt to determine neutrino-nuclear effects has shown some tension with charged-lepton nuclear effects [20]. Due to these unresolved inconsistencies, the typical approach for modern neutrino DIS models has been to adapt existing chargedlepton nuclear effects into neutrino DIS models [21].",

While neutrino experiments present many challenges, including knowledge of the neutrino flux and the unknown effect of final-state interactions, neutrinos provide a unique weak-only probe of the atomic nucleus.

In order to capture single-track events originating from the nuclear targets, the event selection allows vertices originating in two scintillator planes downstream and one plane upstream to be included in the target sample in both single and multi-track events.

DIS signal events are required to have Q 2 \u2265 1.0 GeV 2 and W \u2265 2.0 GeV. The Q 2 of these events is sufficiently large to resolve the nucleon into its parton constituents. The selection of high-W events serves to remove quasielastic and resonant interactions from the sample. The selected event sample contains two backgrounds, both of which are subtracted bin-by-bin from candidate event distributions. The first type arises from detector effects, smearing low W and Q 2 events upward into the DIS selection. The rate of these events is estimated by scaling the Monte Carlo (MC) simulation to agree with data in two sidebands: Q 2 \u2265 1.0 GeV 2 , 1.3 \u2264 W < 1.8 GeV and Q 2 < 0.8 GeV 2 , W \u2265 2.0 GeV. The data in these regions are used to tune two background templates. The first template contains all simulated events with generated W gen < 2.0 GeV (\"low W \"), and the second consists of events with a generated W gen > 2.0 GeV and Q 2 gen < 1.0 GeV 2 (\"low Q 2 \"). The low-W template includes the quasielastic and resonant events. The normalization of each template is fit to the data simultaneously in both sidebands for each nucleus over the energy range 5.0 \u2264 E \u03bd < 50 GeV. The fit results are summarized in Table I. The data tend to prefer a higher background rate at low Q 2 .  A second background arises from events misreconstructed in the passive nuclear target modules that originate in the scintillator modules surrounding the targets but are mis-reconstructed as originating in the passive nuclear target modules. Figure 1 illustrates the simulation of the CH background as well as the passive target signal. These background events are subtracted by measuring the event rate of reconstructed DIS events in the MINERvA tracker region in a manner similar to that described in [1]. The nuclear target region is farther away from MINOS than the fully-active region and as a result the muon acceptances are different. A Geant4 simulation is used to evaluate the different acceptances. This procedure does not fully reproduce the simulated CH background and the difference between the estimated and true CH background in the simulation is included as an additional systematic uncertainty. Figure 2 shows the distribution of DIS events in data and simulation in iron after applying all background corrections and unfolding to correct for detector smearing. The unfolding is based on Bayesian unfolding [40] with one iteration, which reduces biases in the unfolded distributions to the few-percent level. The migration matrix used in unfolding defines the unsmeared x based on the generated energy loss of the neutrino \u03bd, and corrects for the differences based on the E had calculation. Systematic uncertainties at the level of 20% exist primarily due to the neutrino flux estimate. To mitigate flux uncertainties, and to directly evaluate partonic nuclear effects, ratios of cross sections are taken between the nuclear targets (C, Fe, Pb) and CH. Before taking ratios, detector efficiency and loss of DIS events due to W and Q 2 smearing are corrected via an acceptance correction derived from the simulation. The acceptance correction does not include muons with angles greater than 17 \u2022 in either the total or differential cross section. This corresponds to a region of phase space where acceptance into the MINOS detector is poor, and the efficiency is low. The differential cross section ratios after applying the background corrections are shown in Fig. 3 (left). A breakdown of uncertainties for the differential ratios may be found in Table II. There is an x-dependence to the ratios due to the neutron excesses in Fe and Pb. This manifests itself as an increased ratio in the valence quark region (x \u2265 0.3) where the intermediate vector boson is predominantly interacting with d quarks. The ratios corrected for non-isoscalar effects are in Figure 4.",

The disagreement may be explained by the fact that BY13 contains a fit based on charged-lepton scattering which only contains a vector current. For a given x and Q 2 , the coherence length of hadronic fluctuations may be longer for the axial-vector current than the vector current [48]. This would allow shadowing to occur for neutrino scattering in the lowest x bin where vector-current shadowing is greatly suppressed.",

            "text": "Neutrino-nucleus DIS presents a novel method to measure partonic nuclear effects in the weak sector. MIN-ERvA has measured this process using a variety of nuclear targets for the first direct measurement of neutrinonuclear effects by isolating a region of high-Q 2 and high-W events (Q 2 \u2265 1.0 GeV 2 and W \u2265 2.0 GeV). The measured cross-section ratios show a general trend of being larger than the simulation for the lightest nucleus (C). Conversely, the data fall below the simulation in the heaviest nucleus (Pb) at high energy and low x, a trend also observed in a previous Letter [1]. The data agree with genie's treatment of the EMC effect between x = 0.3 and x = 0.75. The lower than expected Pb / CH ratio at large neutrino energy (E \u03bd > 20 GeV) and low Bjorken-x (x < 0.1) is consistent with calculations [49] predicting a different kinematic threshold for shadowing in neutrino nucleus compared to charged-lepton nucleus scattering. Future studies with MINERvA will utilize a higher-energy neutrino spectrum, and will be able to probe this interesting shadowing region by reducing the average x of neutrino DIS events.
