Theoretical models seeking to simultaneously explain all these anomalies, for example with a vector leptoquark, often lead to relatively large branching fractions for the decays B \u2192 K\u00b5 \u00b1 \u03c4 \u2213 [11][12][13][14][15][16].",

In this paper, we present a search for the decay B + \u2192 K + \u00b5 \u2212 \u03c4 + . From an experimental point of view, this combination is preferred over B + \u2192 K + \u00b5 + \u03c4 \u2212 as it has a lower background from semileptonic B \u2192 DX\u00b5 + \u03bd \u00b5 decays, where X refers to any number of additional particles, because Cabibbo-favoured decays of the charm meson are likely to lead to kaons of the same charge as the muon. An upper limit on the branching fraction for the signal decay has been previously set by the BaBar collaboration [17] B(B + \u2192 K + \u00b5 \u2212 \u03c4 + ) < 2.8 \u00d7 10 \u22125 at 90% confidence level (CL).",

By reconstructing the decay vertex of the B + meson from the K + \u00b5 \u2212 pair and the momentum of the K \u2212 JHEP06(2020)129 meson, it is possible to determine the momentum of the B + meson up to a quadratic ambiguity by imposing mass constraints on the B * 0 s2 and B + mesons [18]. This technique was first used to study relative branching fractions in B + \u2192 D 0 X\u00b5 + \u03bd decays [19]. We then search for a peak in the missing-mass squared distribution corresponding to the \u03c4 mass squared, m 2 \u03c4 . Even signal B + mesons not coming from a B * 0 s2 decay show a peak at m 2 \u03c4 . We account for the contribution of these non-B * 0 s2 candidates in the analysis. The \u03c4 leptons are selected inclusively, as we only require one additional charged track near the K + \u00b5 \u2212 pair to help discriminate against background. To normalise the branching fraction, we use the decay B + \u2192 J/\u03c8K + , with J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 . The normalisation channel is also used to quantify the contributions from B * 0 s2 decays, as well as non-B * 0 s2 candidates with nearby kaons. In addition to providing the missing-mass discriminating variable, this method allows us to study the control sample composed of same-sign B + K + decays, which does not include any B * 0 s2 component. We use this sample to optimise the signal selection, and motivate our description of the background missing-mass shape.",

The detector includes a high-precision tracking system consisting of a silicon-strip vertex detector surrounding the pp interaction region, a large-area silicon-strip detector located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4 Tm, and three stations of silicon-strip detectors and straw drift tubes placed downstream of the magnet. The tracking system provides a measurement of the momentum, p, of charged particles with a relative uncertainty that varies from 0.5% at low momentum to 1.0% at 200 GeV. 2 The minimum distance of a track to a primary pp interaction vertex (PV), the impact parameter, is measured with a resolution of (15 + 29/p T ) \u00b5m, where p T is the component of the momentum transverse to the beam, in GeV. Different types of charged hadrons are distinguished using information from two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers. The online event selection is performed by a trigger, which consists of a hardware stage, based on information from the calorimeter and muon systems, followed by a software stage, which applies a full event reconstruction. At the hardware trigger stage, events are required to have a muon with high p T or a hadron, photon or electron with high transverse energy deposited in the calorimeters. The software trigger requires a two-, threeor four-track secondary vertex with a significant displacement from any primary vertex.",

Some examples are semileptonic b-hadron decays to charm where the charm hadron produces a kaon with charge opposite that of the muon, or b-hadron decays where the muon is produced in the semileptonic decay of a child charm hadron. The background training sample is taken from the SSK sample in the m 2 miss region around m 2 \u03c4 . This focuses the training on the sources of background which fall near the signal peak. We describe the signal with simulation samples that include only B * 0 s2 decays; the effect of the BDT on non-B * 0 s2 signal simulation is then estimated separately. The training makes use of different topological reconstructions of the K + \u00b5 \u2212 t + triple: in addition to the signal selection, we also first combine either the kaon and the track or the muon and the track into a pair before adding the third particle. The pair masses and the flight distance of the pair in each topology help to distinguish the signal from background, for instance when the pair comes from a charm hadron decay. We also include the flight distance of the \u03c4 , which we reconstruct as the distance along the \u03c4 trajectory found in the missing-mass calculation from the K + \u00b5 \u2212 vertex to the point of closest approach of the third track. The result of a separate isolation discriminant is included to reduce background with additional charged tracks; this discriminant is trained to distinguish additional tracks belonging to the same b-hadron decay from other tracks in the event.

We describe the m 2 miss shape for the signal component with a generalized hyperbolic distribution [35] with shape parameters obtained from simulation. Two signal shapes are used: one for B * 0 s2 decays, and one for the wider non-B * 0 s2 contribution. We determine the shapes separately in each bin of BDT response. The signal decay model does not significantly affect the signal missing-mass shape. The background is described by polynomial functions which vary independently in each BDT output bin.",

The fifth degree background description obtains the weakest limit among the tested background models. We include the effects of other systematic uncertainties using Gaussian-constrained nuisance parameters. These nuisance parameters modify the normalisation yield, the relative efficiency of the signal and normalisation channels, the signal yield in each BDT bin, and the signal shapes. The largest effects come from the modelling of the kinematics of B * 0 s2 decays in simulation, which results in 5% changes in the relative efficiency and in the signal fractions in each bin of BDT response. The relative statistical uncertainty of the B * 0 s2 fraction taken from the normalisation channel is approximately 7%.

The obtained value for the signal branching fraction from the maximum-likelihood fit is (1.9 \u00b1 1.5) \u00d7 10 \u22125 . No significant excess is observed, and we set upper limits on the branching fraction using the CLs method [36]. We perform a scan in the signal branching fraction, obtaining the signal and background p-values from the distributions of a one-sided profile-likelihood-ratio test statistic obtained with pseudoexperiments in which we vary the constraints on the systematic uncertainties. The scan used to determine the observed limits, compared to the expected one, is shown in   This is the first result from the LHCb experiment for the lepton-flavour violating decay B + \u2192 K + \u00b5 \u2212 \u03c4 + . By studying B + mesons from B * 0 s2 decays, we are able to make the first analysis at LHCb of a B hadron decay using inclusive \u03c4 decays. This provides complementary information to searches for lepton-flavour violation at LHCb with threeprong \u03c4 decays, for example B 0 (s) \u2192 \u03c4 \u00b1 \u00b5 \u2213 decays [37].
