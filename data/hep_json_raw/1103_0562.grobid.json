These results are based on data samples of 232 (inclusive B \u2192 Xc\u2113 \u2212\u03bd ) and 460 (exclusive B \u2192 D\u2113 \u2212\u03bd \u2113 ) million \u03a5(4S) \u2192 BB decays, recorded by the BaBar detector at the PEP-II e + e \u2212 -storage rings. Semileptonic B decays are identified by requiring a lepton (e or \u00b5) in events tagged with a full reconstruction of one of the B mesons in the BB pair.",

Or, an inclusive analysis where X c is not reconstructed, but rather summed over all possible hadronic final states. Theoretically, inclusive determinations rely on an Operator Product Expansion in inverse powers of the b-quark mass [2], which relates the totalB \u2192 X c \u2113 \u2212\u03bd rate to |V cb |. Whereas exclusive determinations use Form Factors (FF) to describe the hadronization process. Current measurements of |V cb | using inclusive and exclusive determinations generally differ by around two standard deviations, with the inclusive result being twice as precise as the exclusive [3].",

Signal events will peak at zero in the m 2 miss distribution as there is only one associated missing particle (left: Fig. 1). Other semileptonic B decays, such asB \u2192 D ( * , * * ) \u2113 \u2212\u03bd \u2113 (feed-down) will yield larger values of m 2 miss due to higher numbers of missing particles generated from secondary semi-leptonic decays of the D ( * , * * ) . A measurement of |V cb | is made using a fit to the w distribution, where data and MC events are evaluated in ten equal-size bins in the interval 1 < w < 1.6 (right: Fig. 1). Data samples are assumed to contain four different contributions:B \u2192 D\u2113 \u2212\u03bd \u2113 signal events, feed-down from other semileptonic B decays, combinatorial BB and continuum background, and fake lepton events (predominantly from hadronic B decays with hadrons misidentified as leptons). From the fit to the combinedB \u2192 D\u2113 \u2212\u03bd \u2113 sample, a measurement of G(1)|V cb | = (43.0 \u00b1 1.9 \u00b1 1.4) \u00d7 10 \u22123 is made. Using an unquenched lattice calculation, corrected by a factor of 1.007 for QED effects, a value of |V cb | = (39.8 \u00b1 1.8 \u00b1 1.3 \u00b1 0.9 F F ) \u00d7 10 \u22123 is extracted, where the third error is due to the theoretical uncertainty from G(1). 4 Inclusive determination of |V cb | using hadronic-mass moments in B \u2192 X c \u2113 \u2212\u03bd decays We are able to extract |V cb | using measurements of the hadronic mass moments m k X [7], with k = 1, ...6 in semileptonic B \u2192 X c \u2113\u03bd decays. These moments are measured as functions of p * \u2113,min between 0.8 GeV/c and 1.9 GeV/c. The measured hadronic mass moments m k X are shown in Fig. 2 with k = 1...6 as functions p * \u2113,min . The statistical uncertainty consists of contributions from the data statistics, and the statistics of the MC. The fit method designed to extract the |V cb | from the moments measurements has been reported in [8] and is based on a \u03c7 2 minimization technique. There are eight fit parameters in total namely: |V cb |, the quark masses m b and m c , the total semileptonic branching fraction B(B \u2192 X c \u2113\u03bd), and the dominant non-perturbative HQE parameters \u00b5 2 G and \u03c1 3 LS . Combined fits to these moments and moments of the photon-energy spectrum in B \u2192 X s \u03b3 decays [9] have resulted in: |V cb | = (42.07 \u00b1 0.45 \u00b1 0.70) \u00d7 10 \u22123 .",
