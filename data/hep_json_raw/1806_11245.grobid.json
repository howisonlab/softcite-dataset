Measurements are presented in three different event categories. The most inclusive of the categories corresponds to an inelastic pp data set, while the other two categories are exclusive subsets of the inelastic sample that are either enhanced or depleted in single diffractive dissociation events. The measurements are compared to predictions from Monte Carlo event generators used to describe high-energy hadronic interactions in collider and cosmic-ray physics.",

            "text": "The study of the properties of particle production without any selection bias arising from requiring the presence of a hard scattering (a selection known as \"minimum bias\") is one of the most basic measurements that can be made at hadron colliders. Such events are produced by strong interactions of partons inside the hadrons, which occur at low momentum exchanges, for which predictions of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) cannot be obtained perturbatively, and for which diffractive scatterings or multiple partonic interactions (MPI) play a significant role. The theoretical description of these components of particle production is based on phenomenological models with free parameters adjusted (\"tuned\") to reproduce the experimental data. However, when a momentum transfer of several GeV (referred to as a hard process) is involved, predictions obtained from perturbative QCD (pQCD) are, in many cases, in good agreement with the measurements. Understanding the transition region between hard processes calculable with perturbative techniques and soft processes described by nonperturbative models is required for a full description of particle production in proton-proton (pp) collisions at the LHC. It is also essential when the cole-mail: cms-publication-committee-chair@cern.ch lider is operated at high luminosities since a bunch crossing contains many pp collisions (pileup) forming a complex final state that needs to be theoretically controlled for precise studies of standard model processes, as well as for new physics searches.",

Parton showers in pythia are modeled according to the Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi (DGLAP) evolution equations [30][31][32], and hadronization is based on the Lund string fragmentation model [33]. Diffractive cross sections are described by the Schuler-Sj\u00f6strand model [34]. Particle production from a low-mass state X, with M X < 10 GeV, is described by the Lund string fragmentation model, while for higher masses, M X > 10 GeV, a perturbative description of the pomeron-proton scattering is introduced. The latter is based on diffractive parton distribution functions [35][36][37], which represent probability distributions for partons inside the proton, under the constraint that the proton emerges intact from the collision. The pythia8 generator is used with the tune cuetp8m1 [20] (also referred to as cuetm1), which is based on the Monash tune [38] using the NNPDF2.3LO [39,40] parton distribution function (PDF) set, with parameters optimized to reproduce underlying event (UE) data from CMS at \u221a s = 7 TeV and CDF at \u221a s = 1.96 TeV. The minimum bias Rockefeller (MBR) model [41] is also implemented within the pythia8 event generator. When used in conjunction with the 4c tune [42] (which includes parton showering) it is referred to as the pythia8 mbr4c model. This model reproduces the measured energy dependence of the total, elastic, and inelastic pp cross sections, and can be used to fully simulate the main diffractive components of the inelastic cross section. The generation of diffractive processes is based on a phenomenological renormalized Regge model [43,44], interpreting the pomeron flux as the probability of forming a diffractive rapidity gap. The value of the pomeron intercept \u03b1(0) = 1.08 is found to give the best description of the diffractive dissociation cross sections measured by CMS at \u221a s = 7 TeV [45]. The data are also compared to predictions from the epos [46] MC event generator (version 1.99) used in cosmic ray physics [47], including contributions from soft-and hardparton dynamics. The soft component is described in terms of the exchange of virtual quasi-particle states, as in Gribov's Reggeon field theory [48], with multi-pomeron exchanges accounting for UE effects. At higher energies, the interaction is described in terms of the same degrees of freedom (reggeons and pomerons), but generalized to include hard processes via hard-pomeron scattering diagrams, which are equivalent to a leading order pQCD approach with DGLAP evolution. The epos generator is used with the LHC tune [49,50].",

            "text": "The data are corrected for tracking and event selection efficiencies, as well as for detector resolution effects. The corrected distributions correspond to stable primary charged particles, which are either directly produced in pp collisions or result from decays of particles with decay length < 1 cm. At particle level, events are selected if at least one charged particle is found within |\u03b7| < 2.4 and p T > 0.5 GeV. The different event selections are defined in a similar manner to how they are defined at detector level in order to avoid any bias towards a specific MC model. Activity in the forward region is defined by the presence of at least one particle, either charged or neutral, with an energy above 5 GeV in the region 3 < |\u03b7| < 5 (referred to as the trigger particle). The veto condition is equivalently defined by the absence of particles with an energy above 5 GeV. The inelastic data set is defined by requiring a trigger particle in the pseudorapidity range 3 < \u03b7 < 5 or \u22125 < \u03b7 < \u22123. The NSD-enhanced event sample is defined by requiring a trigger particle in the regions 3 < \u03b7 < 5 and \u22125 < \u03b7 < \u22123. The SD-enhanced event sample is defined by requiring a trigger particle in either the positive or negative \u03b7 range, with the veto condition applied to the other region. The SD-enhanced event sample is further divided into two exclusive subsets according to the \u03b7 region in which the trigger particle is detected. These subsets are referred to as SD-One-Side enhanced event samples. Table 1 shows a summary of the event selection definitions at particle level. A response matrix, R, is constructed using the information provided by the MC event generators and by the full detector simulation. The elements of the response matrix (R ji ) represent the conditional probability that (for a given observable) a true value i is measured as a value j. In this analysis, two different correction procedures were implemented. The first method (method 1) makes use of the full detector simulation, while in the second method (method 2) a parametrization of the detector response is implemented in order to over-come the statistical limitations of the full detector simulation. Whenever it is possible to accurately parametrize the detector resolution, method 2 is used, otherwise method 1 is applied. The two implemented methods account for unreconstructed particles (misses) and wrongly reconstructed tracks (misreconstruction), as well as for the event selection efficiency including the vertex and enhanced-event selection. In method 1, the correction is performed in two steps. The first step corrects for detector resolution, missed particles and misreconstructed tracks, using an unfolding procedure. The second step corrects for the event selection efficiency. In method 2, the R matrix is constructed in a manner that does not include information on the missed particles and misreconstructed tracks; therefore a correction factor to account for these effects is applied. This correction factor takes into account the missed particles and the misreconstructed tracks, as well as the event selection efficiency. In contrast to method 1, this correction factor is applied as a function of the observable of interest. The reason for this is that the number of missing particles in the reconstruction and the number of misreconstructed tracks both show a dependence on the different observables. The D'Agostini method [54] is used to unfold the detector effects.",

[16]. The tracking efficiency is estimated with a data-driven method known as \"tag-andprobe\" [55] by exploiting resonances decaying into two particles. -Pileup modeling. The systematic uncertainty associated with the modeling of the pileup contribution is calculated by varying the nominal selection of events with exactly one vertex to that obtained with at least one vertex where only the tracks associated with the vertex with the largest sum of the squared transverse momenta of its tracks are used. The difference between these two selections is taken as the associated uncertainty. For the pseudorapidity distributions, the uncertainty is estimated to be about 1% for the inelastic event sample, while it is about 1.5 and 0.3% for the NSD-and SD-enhanced event samples, respectively. An uncertainty of about 2% on the p T distributions for the most inclusive selection procedure is obtained, while it is smaller than 1% for the SD-enhanced event sample. The inelastic and NSDenhanced event samples have similar uncertainties for the multiplicity distributions, first increasing at low multiplicities from 2 to 8% and then decreasing to 0.5% for large multiplicities. -Event selection with HF. The systematic uncertainty associated with the event selection is determined by varying the threshold applied to the energy of the HF calorimeter towers, while keeping the definition of the stable-particle level unchanged. The default value of the energy threshold applied to the HF calorimeter towers is varied from 5 GeV by \u00b11 GeV.",

The pseudorapidity density of the SD-enhanced event sample is about a factor of 4 lower than that of the most inclusive event samples. The p T distributions (i.e., p T , leading p T , and integrated leading p T ) of the SD-enhanced event sample fall very steeply for large p T values. The charged particle multiplicity distribution of the NSD-enhanced event sample shows a depletion of low-multiplicity events and an  increase of high-multiplicity events compared to that of the inelastic sample.

The measurements are compared to the predictions of different MC event generators, namely pythia8 cuetm1, pythia8 mbr4c, and epos LHC. The predictions of epos LHC provide the best description of the data within uncertainties for the inelastic event sample.

The SD-One-Side enhanced event sample is not well described by epos LHC, while pythia8 cuetm1 tends to overestimate data, and the prediction from pythia8 mbr4c describes the measurements within uncertainties over almost the full range, exhibiting some deviations in the regions where the diffractive dissociative system is observed.

The measurements described here provide new insights into low momentum-exchange parton scatterings that dominate inelastic (including diffractive) pp interactions. The rich variety of distributions presented for different event samples, especially those enhanced in diffractive processes, provide new information to understand the transition from perturbative to nonperturbative regions in particle production in high-energy pp collisions and help constrain model parameters in modern hadronic event generators used in collider and cosmic-ray physics. accelerator departments for the excellent performance of the LHC and thank the technical and administrative staffs at CERN and at other CMS institutes for their contributions to the success of the CMS effort.
