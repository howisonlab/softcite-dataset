This analysis improves on previous searches for processes with hadronic decays of W and Z bosons in association with large missing transverse momentum (mono-W/Z searches) due to the larger dataset and further optimization of the event selection and signal region definitions. In addition to the mono-W/Z search, the as yet unexplored hypothesis of a new vector boson Z produced in association with dark matter is considered (mono-Z search). No significant excess over the Standard Model prediction is observed. The results of the mono-W/Z search are interpreted in terms of limits on invisible Higgs boson decays into dark matter particles, constraints on the parameter space of the simplified vector-mediator model and generic upper limits on the visible cross sections for W/Z+DM production. The results of the mono-Z search are shown in the framework of several simplified-model scenarios involving DM production in association with the Z boson.",

Discovery of DM particles and understanding their interactions with SM particles is one of the greatest quests in particle physics and cosmology today. Several different experimental approaches are being exploited. Indirect detection experiments search for signs of DM annihilation or decays in outer space, while direct detection experiments are sensitive to low-energy recoils of nuclei induced by interactions with DM particles from the galactic halo. The interpretation of these searches is subject to astrophysical uncertainties in DM abundance -1 -",

Several searches for such signatures performed with LHC pp collision data at centre-of-mass energies of 7, 8 and 13 TeV observed no deviations from SM predictions and set limits on various DM particle models. Measurements include those probing DM production in association with a hadronically decaying W or Z boson [1][2][3][4] and dedicated searches for the so-called invisible decays of the Higgs boson into a pair of DM particles, targeting Higgs boson production in association with a hadronically decaying vector boson [5][6][7]. In the SM, the invisible Higgs boson decays occur through the H \u2192 ZZ \u2192 \u03bd\u03bd\u03bd\u03bd process with a branching ratio B SM H\u2192inv. of 1.06 \u00d7 10 \u22123 for a Higgs boson mass m H = 125 GeV [8]. Some extensions of the SM allow invisible decays of the Higgs boson into DM or neutral long-lived massive particles [9][10][11][12][13] with a significantly larger branching ratio B H\u2192inv. . In this case H is required to have properties similar to those of a SM Higgs boson and is assumed to be the Higgs boson with mass of 125 GeV that was discovered at the LHC. At present, the most stringent upper limit on B H\u2192inv. is about 23% at 95% confidence level (CL) for m H = 125 GeV, obtained from a combination of direct searches and indirect constraints from Higgs boson coupling measurements [5,14].",

There are four free parameters in this model: the DM and the mediator masses (m \u03c7 and m Z , respectively), and the mediator couplings to the SM and DM particles (g SM and g DM , respectively). The minimal total mediator decay width is assumed, allowing only vector mediator decays into DM or quarks. Its value is determined by the choice of the coupling values g SM and g DM [21] and it is much smaller than the mediator mass. The second is a model with invisible Higgs boson decays in which a Higgs boson H produced in SM Higgs boson production processes decays into a pair of DM particles which escape detection.

The A14 set of tuned parameters [28] was used together with the NNPDF23lo PDF set [29] for these signal samples. The mono-W/Z signal samples within the simplified vector-mediator model were generated in a grid of mediator and DM particle masses, with coupling values set to g SM = 0.25 and g DM = 1 following the 'V1' scenario from ref. [30]. The mediator mass m Z and the DM particle mass m \u03c7 range from 10 GeV to 10 TeV and from 1 GeV to 1 TeV respectively. Two samples with m \u03c7 = 1 GeV were used to evaluate the impact of theory uncertainties on the signal, one with a mediator mass of 300 GeV and the other with a mediator mass of 600 GeV. The mono-Z samples were simulated for mediator masses between 50 GeV and 500 GeV, with the g DM coupling value set to g DM = 1. Following the current experimental constraints from dijet resonance searches [31][32][33][34], in particular those for the mediator mass range below about 500 GeV studied in this analysis, the g SM coupling value was set to 0.1. For this choice of the couplings, the width of the Z boson is negligible compared to the experimental resolution, allowing limits to be set on the coupling product g SM \u2022 g DM .

The criteria have been optimized to obtain the maximum expected signal significance. In the merged (resolved) event topology, at least one large-R jet (at least two small-R jets) and E miss T values above 250 GeV (above 150 GeV) are required in the final state. In order to suppress the tt and V +jets background with heavy-flavour jets, all events with merged topology containing b-tagged track jets not associated to the large-R jet via ghost-association are rejected. In the resolved topology, all events with more than two b-tagged small-R jets are rejected. The highest-p T large-R jet in an event is considered as the candidate for a hadronically decaying vector boson in the merged topology. Similarly, in the resolved topology the two highest-p T (leading) b-tagged small-R jets are selected as the candidate for a hadronically decaying W or Z boson and, if there are fewer than two b-jets in the final state, the highest-p T remaining jets are used to form the hadronic W or Z boson decay candidate. Additional criteria are applied in both merged and resolved topologies to suppress the contribution from multijet events. Since the vector bosons in signal events are recoiling against the dark matter particles, a threshold is applied on the azimuthal separation between the E miss T vector and the highest-p T large-R jet (system of the two highest-p T jets) in the merged (resolved) topology, \u2206\u03c6(E miss T , J or jj) > 120 o . Also, the angles between E miss requirements also reduce noncollision background from beam halo or beam-gas interactions that produce signal in time with the colliding proton bunches. Such events are characterized mainly by energy deposits in the calorimeters in the absence of track activity. In the categories with two b-tagged jets the non-collision background is negligible and the expected discovery significance is higher without the p miss T requirement, which is not applied. Further criteria are imposed on events with the resolved topology. The leading jet is required to have p j 1 T > 45 GeV. To improve the modelling of the trigger efficiency with MC events, the scalar sum of the transverse momenta of all jets is required to be p j i T > 120 (150) GeV in events with two (at least three) jets.",

The E miss T distributions after the full selection, as well as the m J and m jj distributions before the mass window requirement, are shown for various signal models in figures 2 and 3. Figure 4 shows the product (A \u00d7 \u03b5) total of the signal acceptance A and selection efficiency \u03b5 for the simplified vector-mediator model and for the dark-fermion and dark-Higgs mono-Z signal models after the full event selection. This product is defined as the number of signal events satisfying the full set of selection criteria, divided by the total number of generated signal events. For all signal models, the main efficiency loss is caused by the minimum E miss T requirement. In the simplified vector-mediator model, the (A \u00d7 \u03b5) total , obtained by summing up signal contributions from all event categories, increases from 1% for low to 15% for high mediator mass due to the increase of the missing transverse momentum in the final state.

The uncertainties in the V +jets background contribution come mainly from limited knowledge of the jet flavour composition in terms of the V +HF categorization introduced in section 5, as well as the modelling of the vector boson transverse momentum (p V T ) and dijet mass (m jj ) distributions. The former are evaluated by means of scale variations in the generated Sherpa samples. In addition, the difference between the Sherpa nominal sample and an alternative MadGraph5 aMC@NLO v2.2.2 sample produced with a different matrix-element generator is added in quadrature to yield the total uncertainty. The uncertainty in the modelling of the p V T and m jj distributions is obtained from the comparison of simulated events with dedicated control-region data, as well as comparisons with alternative generator predictions. For tt production, uncertainties in the shapes of the top-quark transverse momentum distribution, and the m jj and p V T distributions of the V boson candidate, are considered by comparing the nominal simulated sample to alternative samples with different parton shower, matrix element generation and tuning parameters. A similar procedure is applied for the diboson and single-top-quark backgrounds. While the overall V +jets and tt normalization is determined from the fit to data, the comparison between different generators is also employed to assign a normalization uncertainty to single-top-quark and diboson production since their contributions are estimated from simulation.",

In addition to the normalization factors, the final background event yields in each event category are also affected by the systematic uncertainties discussed in section 8. For all backgrounds other than Z+HF and tt, the number of background events obtained from the fit agrees well with the prediction from simulation in each event category individually. The observed number of events passing the final mono-W/Z signal selection is shown for each event category in table 3 together with the expected background contributions obtained from the fit under the background-only hypothesis. The expectations for several signal points within the simplified vector-mediator model and for the invisible Higgs boson decays are shown in addition for comparison. Figures 5 and 6 show the corresponding distributions of the missing transverse momentum in the merged and resolved mono-W/Z signal regions, respectively. The background contributions which are illustrated here are obtained from a simultaneous fit of the expected final discriminants to data with a background-only hypothesis in all signal, sideband and control regions. In this scenario the signal regions lead to a strong constraint of the total background estimate, which is relaxed with a floating signal contribution in the final fit.",

The limits on these two processes are evaluated separately to allow more flexibility in terms of possible reinterpretations, as new models might prefer one of these two final states. While the event selection and categorization is the same as described in section 6, i.e. including the b-tagging and mass window requirements, the exclusion limits are provided in the fiducial region that is defined by applying all signal region selection criteria except for the requirements on m jj or m J and the b-tagging multiplicity. With this definition, the exclusion limits on \u03c3 vis apply to any processes which are characterized by a generic back-to-back topology with a W/Z boson recoiling against E miss T from weakly interacting particles such as DM. The limits on \u03c3 vis are given as a function of the E miss T variable in order to avoid any additional model-dependent assumptions on the E miss T distribution. Hence, the E miss T bins in the zero-lepton region are treated independently of each other in the statistical interpretation of the data. A reduced number of bins is used for E miss T > 300 GeV to reduce the statistical uncertainty in the per-bin analysis. In all other aspects, the approach is identical to the mono-W/Z analysis described above. The mono-W/Z vector-mediator signal samples are used as a benchmark model to estimate the residual dependence of the \u03c3 vis limits on the kinematic properties of events within a given E miss T range and on the b-tagging multiplicity. For this, a wide range of (m Z , m \u03c7 ) model parameters that yield a sizeable contribution of at least 500 simulated events in a given E miss T range is considered. Corresponding variations of 15-50% (25-50%) in the expected limits on \u03c3 vis, W+DM (\u03c3 vis, Z+DM ) are found. The weakest \u03c3 vis limit is quoted in a given range of reconstructed E miss T in order to minimize the dependence on a benchmark model. The observed and expected limits on \u03c3 vis in each E miss T range are shown in figure 10, with the numerical values summarized in tables 7 and 8. As a general trend, the limits on Z + DM production are somewhat stronger than those on W + DM since the former contributes significantly to the 2b category that has the highest sensitivity due to having the lowest SM background.",
