            "text": "Supersymmetry (SUSY) with bilinearly broken R parity (bRPV) offers an attractive possibility to explain the origin of neutrino masses and mixings. In such scenarios, the study of neutralino decays at colliders gives access to neutrino sector parameters. The ILC offers a very clean environment to study the neutralino properties as well as its subsequent decays, which typically involve a W or Z boson and a lepton. This study is based on ILC beam parameters according to the Technical Design Report for a center of mass energy of 500 GeV. A full detector simulation of the International Large Detector (ILD) has been performed for all Standard Model backgrounds and for neutralino pair production within a simplified model. The bRPV parameters are fixed according to current neutrino data. In this scenario, the\u03c7 0 1 mass can be reconstructed with an uncertainty of \u03b4m fit \u03c7 0 1 = (40(stat.) \u2295 50(syst.)) MeV for an integrated luminosity of 500 fb \u22121 from direct\u03c7 0 1 pair production, thus, to a large extent independently of the rest of the SUSY spectrum. The achievable precision on the atmospheric neutrino mixing angle sin 2 \u03b8 23 from measuring the neutralino branching fractions BR(\u03c7 0 1 \u2192 W \u03bc) and BR(\u03c7 0 1 \u2192 W \u03c4 ) at the ILC is in the same range than current uncertainties from neutrino experiments. Thus, the ILC could have the opportunity to unveil the mechanism of neutrino mass generation.",

In addition to that, the three sneutrinos acquire a vacuum expectation value (VEV) \u03bd i = v i . Because of three additional tadpole equations one ends up with six free parameters for bilinear R parity violation. These parameters can be fixed by fitting them to neutrino observables, like neutrino mass differences and mixing angles. The introduction of lepton number violation allows the neutrinos to mix with the other neutral fermions of the model, i.e. the gauginos and higgsinos. Thus, in the basis of neutral fermions 0T = B, W 0 , H 0 d , H 0 u , \u03bd e , \u03bd \u03bc , \u03bd \u03c4 the corresponding mass term in the Lagrangian looks like",

However, the cross section for direct \u03c7 0 1 \u03c7 0 1 production at the LHC is extremely small, unless a specific Higgsino-Wino mixing is assumed [26]. So, usually production of heavier electroweakinos is considered, which decay via the LSP to Standard Model particles. Therefore, the limits can only be given as a combination of \u03c7 0 1 mass and the mass of a heavier electroweakino. In the RPV case, currently one study is present that assumes direct chargino production and one additional non-vanishing trilinear RPV coupling [26]. The resulting limits in the m \u03c7 0 1 -m \u03c7 \u00b1 1 plane strongly depend on the assumed RPV coupling. Under the most optimistic assumptions, chargino masses up to 750 GeV have been probed. Due to the strong dependency on the assumed type and strength of the RPV couplings, it is not possible to directly re-interpret these limits in a bRPV scenario which accounts for neutrino data.",

However, those escaping pair-produced LSPs could still be detected via radiative LSP production for cross sections of O(10 fb) as demonstrated in [29]. In this study, we focus on scenarios where the on-shell W -decay channel is available, i.e. on LSP masses larger than the W mass. Thus, the decay length of the LSP lies between  10 cm and 100 \u00b5m as depicted in Fig. 3 (left).

To this end, properties of charged particles are only measured by the tracking system and the highly segmented calorimeters are only used for the measurement of neutral particles. The main part of the proposed tracking system at the ILD is a time-projection chamber, which is complemented by silicon strip and pixel detectors.

In our scenario, the muons originating from an LSP decay carry a momentum of up to 80 GeV, while the jets originating from the W bosons from the signal decay have an energy of up to 200 GeV. The muon momentum scale can be calibrated using Z boson decays. The unpolarized cross section of the process e + e \u2212 \u2192 Z \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 at the ILC500 amounts to 2.5 pb.

Assuming that ultimatively the precision of the scale calibration is limited by the available statistics for the calibration process, we estimate that a precision of 1/ N \u03bc\u03bc = 0.09 % can be reached.",

The resulting impact on the neutralino mass determination is 11 MeV. Thus it could be a factor 4 larger before it becomes comparable to the contribution from the momentum scale. Alternatively, exploiting kinematic fits [43] in conjunction with the well-known beam energy, at the ILC foreseen to be controlled to 10 \u22124 [10], could significantly reduce the dependence of the reconstructed neutralino mass on the jet energy scale, leading to similar final precision estimates.",

However, the ILC itself will offer numerous opportunities for SM precision measurements beyond today's knowledge.

The result of a random parameter scan consisting of 6,000 scan points [45] is depicted in Fig. 9. We find that for 95 % of all found viable SUSY parameter points the deviation of the correlation between atmospheric mixing angle and the ratio of the branching ratios is below 17 %. Assuming that the remaining three electroweakinos are measureable at ILC1000, which is an optional upgrade of the ILC to a center of mass energy of 1 TeV, the correlation uncertainty reduces to 7 %. The derived precision of the measurement of the atmospheric neutrino mixing angle for different assumed parametric uncertainties is shown in Fig. 10 (left). One can now compare this precision with the uncertainty of current neutrino experiments [46], which is done in Fig. 10 (right). The middle red line indicates the best fit value of the atmospheric neutrino mixing angle and the upper and lower dashed red lines indicate the 1\u03c3 uncertainty. An agreement between the collider and neutrino experiment data would clearly establish bRPV as origin of neutrino masses. Improvements from future neutrino experiments or a reduction of the parametric uncertainty by observation of additional SUSY particles at the ILC or the LHC would strengthen this conclusion even further.",
