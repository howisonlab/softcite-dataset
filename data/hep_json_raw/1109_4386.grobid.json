In a QCD picture, jet quenching is dominated by gluon bremsstrahlung, leading to softening of the typical jet fragmentation pattern relative to jets in vacuum. The imposition of kinematic cuts on the jet constituents, including \"jet\" measurements via single leading hadrons, results in an apparent medium-induced energy loss of the jet, though full reconstruction of the jet should recover its full energy. Jets of finite acceptance (finite R) may nevertheless not recover the full jet energy due to large angle radiation; indeed, that is expected to be the clearest way to measure the phenomenon.",

Such jet measurements are challenging in the complex environment of heavy ion collisions, however, due to the very large flux of soft hadrons from other, incoherent interactions in the collision. The STAR Collaboration at RHIC has previously presented the analysis of inclusive jet and hadron-jet coincidence rates in central Au + Au collisions [1,2], in which minimal kinematic cuts on the jet constituents are imposed, to achieve minimal bias of the resulting distributions. However, these analyses employed model assumptions for the influence of background on the jet measurements, and imposed kinematic cuts on the measured (i.e. jet+background) distributions themselves. Both effects need careful assessment to establish their systematic uncertainties.",

Jet reconstruction utilizes charged particles measured in the Time Projection Chamber (TPC) and neutral energy measured in the Barrel Electromagnetic Calorimeter (BEMC) [3]. All tracks and towers with p T > 0.2 GeV/c are used as input for the jet reconstruction. Jets are reconstructed by k T [4] and anti-k T [5] algorithms with resolution parameter R = 0.4 using an energy recombination scheme, as implemented in FASTJET [6]. The anti-k T algorithm is used to reconstruct signal jets and the k T algorithm to evaluate the median background energy density. A jet is accepted if its centroid lies within |\u03b7| < 0. Because of the complex interplay between the hard jet component (high Q 2 ) and fluctuations in measured jet energy due to the underlying event, in this analysis we define a \"jet\" operationally, simply as the direct output of the reconstruction algorithm. We relegate the separation of hard jet and background to a separate step. The \"Direct\" jet transverse energy is defined as [7]:",

The distribution is calculated using 1M different PYTHIA jets/single pions in different STAR events. With high probability (\u223c 73% in this case), the response of anti-k T is within 200 MeV the same for two very different fragmentation patterns. Similar results are obtained for much lower jet p T , and for QPYTHIA-generated quenched jets. This quantifies the insensitivity of anti-k T to the fragmentation pattern in the presence of a heavy-ion background event, a crucial property for jet quenching studies. Anti-k T appears to respond geometrically [5]. Figure 2, left panel, shows the Direct jet energy distribution (eq. (1)) for two different centrality classes: 0 \u2212 5% and 5 \u2212 10%. Due to the operational definition in this analysis of a jet simply as the output of the jet reconstruction corrected event-wise for median background level, a large fraction of the \"jets\" in the distribution have apparently unphysical negative energy. This is trivially due to the fact that \u03c1 is the median energy density. However, we expect the negative energy \"jets\" to be dominated by combinatorial jets arising from incoherent soft processes, and will use their distribution to constrain our estimate of background fluctuations. In addition, the hard jet component lies on top of the fluctuations and is broadly distributed in the figure; imposing any cut on p direct T introduces an arbitrary threshold whose effect is difficult to quantify.",

This functional form for the distribution of transverse energy in a finite acceptance corresponds to the independent emission of a large number of particles drawn from an exponential p T distribution [11]. A related function has been found to describe the distribution of a closely related observable, event-wise mean p T ( p T ) at the SPS [12] and RHIC [13,14]. The distribution has contributions from multiple sources of fluctuations, both few-particle and global, such as reaction plane orientation and residual dependence on event centrality. The Gamma-fn. parametrization includes all such effects with proper averaging. Figure 3, left panel, shows the Gamma-fn. fit to the negative region, and extrapolation to the positive region, for the Direct jet spectrum for 0 \u2212 5% central events. The fit describes the negative region well over \u223c 3 \u2212 4 orders of magnitude. The right panel compares the difference between the fits for different centralities to that for the data (same as Fig. 2, right panel). As expected, there is a good agreement between the data and the fit in the negative region of the difference spectrum. The fit difference overshoots the data difference at moderate p direct T > 0 while undershooting it for p direct T 10 GeV. This is expected, since the growth at large p direct T for more central collisions is due in part to additional hard jets, which must displace a fraction of soft jets in order to conserve total jet number.

            "text": "The final analysis of the hard jet component is beyond the scope of these proceedings. Further systematic investigation of background corrections, that are independent of the Gamma-function ansatz, are in progress. Alternative functional forms for the background estimation are also under investigation. However, we note that an important check on the hard component to be extracted from Fig. 3, right panel, comes from the well-established binary-collision scaling of hard process rates in nuclear collisions. Glauber modeling indicates that < N bin >\u223c 1000 for the 0-5% centrality class, while < N bin >\u223c 800 for 5-10%. Thus, difference spectrum in Fig. 2 must reflect the jet production rate due to \u223c 200 additional binary collisions. Implicit, of course, is the assumption that quenching effects do not vary significantly between the centrality bins.",
