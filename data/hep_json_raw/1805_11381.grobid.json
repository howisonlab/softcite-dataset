For models with R-parity conservation [7], strongly produced sparticles would be pair-produced and are expected to decay into quarks or gluons, sometimes leptons, and the lightest SUSY particle (LSP), which is stable. The LSP is assumed to be weakly interacting and thus is not detected, resulting in events with potentially large missing transverse momentum ( p miss T , with magnitude E miss T ). In such a scenario the LSP could be a dark-matter candidate [8,9].",

All sparticles not directly involved in the decay chains considered are assigned very high masses, such that they are decoupled. Three example decay topologies are shown in Fig. 1. For all models with gluino pair production, a three-body decay forg \u2192 qq\u03c7 0 2 is assumed. Signal models are generated on a grid over a twodimensional space, varying the gluino or squark mass and the mass of either the\u03c7 0 2 or the\u03c7 0 1 . The first model considered with gluino production, illustrated on the left of Fig. 1, is the so-called slepton model, which assumes that the sleptons are lighter than the\u03c7 0 2 .

The masses of the superpartners of the left-handed leptons are set to the average of the\u03c7 0 2 and\u03c7 0 1 masses, while the superpartners of the right-handed leptons are decoupled. The three slepton flavours are taken to be mass-degenerate. The kinematic endpoint in the invariant mass distribution of the two final-state leptons in this decay chain can occur at any mass, highlighting the need to search over the full dilepton mass distribution.

For two of these models, the LSP mass is set to 1 GeV, inspired by SUSY scenarios with a low-mass LSP (e.g. generalised gauge mediation [20][21][22]). Sparticle mass points are generated across theg \u2212\u03c7 0 2 (orq \u2212\u03c7 0 2 ) plane. These two models are referred to here as theg \u2212\u03c7 0 2 onshell andq \u2212\u03c7 0 2 on-shell models, respectively. The third model is based on topologies that could be realised in the 19-parameter phenomenological supersymmetric Standard Model (pMSSM) [23,24] with potential LSP masses of 100 GeV or more. In this case the\u03c7 0 2 mass is chosen to be 100 GeV above the\u03c7 0 1 mass, which can maximise the branching fraction to Z bosons. Sparticle mass points are generated across theg \u2212\u03c7 0 1 plane, and this model is thus referred to as theg \u2212\u03c7 0 1 on-shell model. For the two models with gluino pair production, the branching fractions for q = u, d, c, s are each 25%. For the model involving squark pair production, the super-partners of the u-, d-, c-and s-quarks have the same mass, with the super-partners of the b-and t-quarks being decoupled.

These samples are used to estimate backgrounds with real E miss T in \u03b3 + jets data samples. The SUSY signal samples were produced at LO using MG5_aMC@NLO with the NNPDF2.3LO PDF set, interfaced with Pythia 8.186. The scale parameter for CKKW-L matching [42,43] was set at a quarter of the mass of the gluino. Up to one additional parton is included in the matrix element calculation. The underlying event was modelled using the A14 tune for all signal samples, and EvtGen was adopted to describe the properties of bottom and charm hadron decays. Signal cross-sections were calculated at NLO in \u03b1 S , including resummation of soft gluon emission at nextto-leading-logarithmic accuracy (NLO+NLL) [44][45][46][47][48].",

These are imposed by using the jet vertex tagger described in Ref. [77]. Finally, events containing a baseline jet that does not pass jet quality requirements are vetoed in order to remove events impacted by detector noise and non-collision backgrounds [78,79]. The MV2C10 boosted decision tree algorithm [80,81] identifies jets containing b-hadrons (bjets) by using quantities such as the impact parameters of associated tracks and positions of any good reconstructed secondary vertices. A selection that provides 77% efficiency for tagging b-jets in simulated tt events is used. The corresponding rejection factors against jets originating from cquarks, tau leptons, and light quarks and gluons in the same sample for this selection are 6, 22, and 134, respectively. These tagged jets are called b-tagged jets.",

For SR-low and SR-medium a cut on m T2 of > 70 GeV and > 25 GeV, respectively, is applied to reduce backgrounds from top-quark production. In order to make model-dependent interpretations using the signal models described in Sect. 3, a profile likelihood [86] fit to the m shape is performed in each SR separately, with m bin boundaries chosen to ensure a sufficient number of events for a robust background estimate in each bin and maximise sensitivity to target signal models. The m bins are also used to form 29 non-orthogonal m windows to probe the existence of BSM physics or to assess model-independent upper limits on the number of possible signal events. These windows are chosen so that they are sensitive to a broad range of potential kinematic edge positions. In cases where the signal could stretch over a large m range, the exclusive bins used in the shape fit potentially truncate the lower-m tail, and so are less sensitive. Of these windows, ten are in SR-low, nine are in SR-medium and ten are in SR-high. A schematic diagram showing the m bin edges in the SRs and the subsequent m windows is shown in Fig. 3. More details of the m definitions in these windows are given along with the results in Sect. 9. Models without light sleptons are targeted by windows with m < 81 GeV for m \u03c7 < m Z , and by the window with 81 < m < 101 GeV for m \u03c7 > m Z . The on-Z bins of the SRs, with bin boundaries 81 < m < 101 GeV, are each considered as one of the 29 m windows, having good sensitivity to models with on-shell Z bosons in the final state.",

These backgrounds are modelled using MC simulation, with the dominant tt and W t components being normalised to data in dedicated e\u03bc CRs. The top-quark background normalisation in SRC is taken from CRC, while CRC-MET is used to extract the top-quark background normalisation for SRC-MET. The modelling of these backgrounds is tested in four VRs: VRA, VRA2, VRB and VRC, where the normalisation for tt and W t is 1.00 \u00b1 0.22, 1.01 \u00b1 0.13, 1.00 \u00b1 0.21 and 0.86\u00b10.13, respectively, calculated from identical regions in the e\u03bc channel. Figure 5 shows a comparison between data and prediction in these four VRs. VRA probes low p T in the range equivalent to that in SRC, but at lower E miss T , while VRB and VRC are used to check the background modelling at p T > 20 GeV, but with E miss T between 250 and 500 GeV.

This procedure accounts for small differences in event-level kinematics between the \u03b3 + jets events and Z /\u03b3 * + jets events, which arise mainly from the mass of the Z boson. Following this, to account for the difference in resolution between photons, electrons, and muons, which can be particularly significant at high boson p T , the photon p T is smeared according to a Z \u2192 ee or Z \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc resolution function. The smearing function is derived by comparing the p miss T -projection along the boson momentum in Z /\u03b3 * + jets and \u03b3 + jets MC events in a 1-jet control region with no other event-level kinematic requirements. A deconvolution procedure is used to avoid including the photon resolution in the Z bosons's p T resolution function. For each event, a photon p T smearing p T is obtained by sampling the smearing function. The photon p T is shifted by p T , with the parallel component of the p miss T vector being correspondingly adjusted by \u2212 p T .",

This principle is then expanded to a dilepton selection by using a four-by-four matrix to account for the various possible real-fake combinations for the two leading leptons in an event. The real-lepton efficiency, real , is measured in Z \u2192 data events using a tag-and-probe method in CR-real, defined in Table 4. In this region the p T of the leading lepton is required to be > 40 GeV, and only events with exactly two SFOS leptons are selected. The efficiency for fake leptons, fake , is measured in CR-fake, a region enriched with fake leptons by requiring same-sign lepton pairs. The lepton p T requirements are the same as those in CR-real, with the leading lepton being tagged as the \"real\" lepton and the fakelepton efficiency being evaluated using the sub-leading lepton in the event. A requirement of E miss T < 125 GeV is used to reduce possible contamination from non-SM processes (e.g. SUSY). In this region, the background due to prompt-lepton production, estimated from MC simulation, is subtracted from the total data contribution. Prompt-lepton production makes up 7% (10%) of the baseline electron (muon) sample and 10% (60%) of the signal electron (muon) sample in CR-fake. From the resulting data sample the fraction of events in which the baseline leptons pass the signal selection requirements yields the fake-lepton efficiency.

The full reweighting and smearing procedure is carried out using \u03b3 + jets MC events such that an MC non-closure uncertainty can be derived by comparing the resulting \u03b3 + jets MC E miss T distribution to that in Z /\u03b3 * + jets MC events. An uncertainty of 10% is obtained for the V \u03b3 backgrounds, based on a data-to-MC comparison in a V \u03b3 -enriched control region where events are required to have a photon and one lepton. This uncertainty is propagated to the final Z /\u03b3 * + jets estimate following the subtraction of the V \u03b3 background. Finally, the statistical precision of the estimate also enters as a systematic uncertainty in the final background estimate. Depending on the m range in question, the uncertainties in the Z /\u03b3 * + jets prediction can vary from \u223c 10% to > 100%.",

The exclusion contour shown is derived using a combination of results from the three highp T and two lowp T SRs based on the best-expected sensitivity. The lowp T SRs drive the limits close to the diagonal, with the highp T SRs taking over at high gluino masses. In SR-low there is good sensitivity at high gluino and high LSP masses. Around gluino mass of 1.8 TeV, the observed limit drops below the expected limit by 200 GeV, where the dilepton kinematic edge is expected to occur around 800 GeV. Here the highest m bin in SRlow (m >501 GeV), which is the bin driving the limit in this region, has a mild excess in data, explaining this effect. The region where the lowp T search becomes the most sensitive can be seen close to the diagonal, where there is a kink in the contour at m(g) \u223c 1400 GeV. A zoomed-in view of the compressed region of phase space, the region close to the diagonal for this model, is provided in the m(g) \u2212 (m(g) \u2212 m(\u03c7 0 1 )) plane in the bottom panel of Fig. 12. Here the exclusion contour includes only the lowp T regions. SRC-MET has the best sensitivity almost everywhere, except at low values of LSP mass (at the top-left of the bottom panel of Fig. 12), where SRC drives the limit. An exclusion contour derived using a combination of results from the three highp T SRs alone is overlaid, demonstrating the increased sensitivity brought by the lowp T analysis.",

For the highp T and lowp T searches combined, a set of 41 m windows are considered, with different requirements on E miss T , m T2 , p T and H T , to be sensitive to signals with different kinematic endpoint values in the dilepton invariant mass distribution. The data are found to be consistent with the Standard Model expectation. The results are interpreted in simplified models of gluino-pair production and squark-pair production, and exclude gluinos (squarks) with masses as large as 1.85 TeV (1.3 TeV). Models with mass splittings as low as 20 GeV are excluded due to the sensitivity to compressed scenarios offered by the lowp T SRs. ation of the LHC, as well as the support staff from our institutions without whom ATLAS could not be operated efficiently.

The dotted lines surrounding the observed limit contour indicate the variation resulting from changing the signal cross-section within its uncertainty (\u00b11\u03c3 SUSY theory ). The shaded area indicates the observed limit on this model from Ref.[15] ",

The expected and observed exclusion contours for thisg \u2212\u03c7 0 2 on-shell grid are shown in the m(g) \u2212 m(\u03c7 0 2 ) plane in Fig. 14. The expected (observed) lower limit on the gluino mass is about 1.60 TeV (1.65 TeV) for a\u03c7 0 2 with a mass of 1.2 TeV in this model. Here, the on-Z window of SR-medium drives the limit close to the diagonal, while SR-high takes over at high m(g) and lower m(\u03c7 0 2 ). A kink can be seen in the observed limit contour at the point at which the SR with the best-expected sensitivity changes from SR-medium to SR-high. Figure 14 also shows the expected and observed exclusion limits for theq \u2212\u03c7 0 2 on-shell model in the m(q) \u2212 m(\u03c7 0",
