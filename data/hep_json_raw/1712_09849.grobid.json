The MoEDAL forward trapping detector, comprising 222 kg of aluminium samples, was exposed to 2.11 fb \u22121 of 13 TeV proton-proton collisions near the LHCb interaction point and analysed by searching for induced persistent currents after passage through a superconducting magnetometer. Magnetic charges equal to the Dirac charge or above are excluded in all samples. The results are interpreted in Drell-Yan production models for monopoles with spins 0, 1/2 and 1: in addition to standard point-like couplings, we also consider couplings with momentum-dependent form factors. The search provides the best current laboratory constraints for monopoles with magnetic charges ranging from two to five times the Dirac charge.",

Dirac's argument also predicts the minimum magnetic charge that a monopole should carry, the Dirac charge g D , which is equivalent to 68.5 times the elementary electric charge. It follows that a relativistic (\u03b2 = v c > 0.5) monopole would ionise matter at least a thousand times more than a relativistic proton or electron. The Dirac charge g D is obtained considering the electron charge e as the fundamental unit of free electric charge; it is worth noting though that using the down-quark charge 1 3 e instead of e results in a minimum magnetic charge of 3g D , although in this case one cannot apply the Dirac argument in its original form because quarks are confined [4].",

            "text": "The monopole hypothesised by Dirac was assumed to be pointlike and structureless, and as such its underlying microscopic theory is completely unknown. Monopoles with masses that could be in a range accessible to colliders have been predicted to exist within extensions of the standard model [6][7][8][9][10]. Other potentially low-mass monopoles within grand-unification theories or string-inspired models have also been predicted recently [11,12]. However, these exhibit detailed structure and as a consequence their production by particle collisions is expected to be suppressed [13], although enhanced production might be expected in environments with strong magnetic fields and high tempera-tures, such as those characterising heavy-ion collisions [14,15]. Our search for monopole production in high-energy proton-proton (pp) collisions directly probes for free stable massive objects carrying a single or multiple Dirac charges, without assumptions about the monopole's structure. Monopole pair-production cross-sections are constrained with some model dependence because the detector acceptance depends on the monopole energy and angular distributions. To extract mass limits and compare results from different experiments, in absence of a better approach, the custom is to use cross sections computed from specific pair-production models such as Drell-Yan (DY) at leading order, with the caveat that the coupling of the monopole to the photon is so large that perturbative calculations are not expected to be reliable. For this reason it is preferable to interpret the search using as many different but theoretically well predicated models as possible.",

To cover the broadest possible ranges of masses, charges and cross sections, LHC-based direct searches for monopoles ought to use several complementary techniques, including general-purpose detectors, dedicated detectors, and trapping [20]. Searches were made in data samples of 7 and 8 TeV pp collisions at the LHC with the ATLAS and MoEDAL experiments, probing the TeV scale for the https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physletb.2018.05.069 0370-2693/\u00a9 2018 The Author(s).

Each sample was passed through the sensing coils at least once, with recordings of the magnetometer response in all three coordinates before, during, and after passage. The coil measuring the z coordinate (along the shaft) is used for the monopole search because it circles the shaft in such a way that samples traverse it during transport; the x and y coordinates are used only to provide information about the strength and direction of magnetic dipole impurities contained in the samples. The persistent current is defined as the difference between the mea-sured responses in the z coordinate after and before passage of the sample, from which the contribution of the conveyor tray is subtracted. A calibration factor obtained from special calibration runs using two independent methods [23,24,26] is used to translate this value into the measured magnetic charge in the samples in units of Dirac charge.",

Measurements can then be repeated as many times as needed to minimise systematic errors and increase the sensitivity to the desired level. The 0.4g D threshold is chosen as a compromise between allowing sensitivity to magnetic charges down to 1g D and the time and effort required to scan a large number of samples multiple times. This gives 43 candidates, which were remeasured at least two more times each, as shown in the bottom panel of Fig. 1. A sample for which a majority of measurements yields values below our threshold is considered to be a false positive, since a genuine monopole would consistently yield the same non-zero persistent current value.",

The first effect is a slight deterioration of the z measurements due to random flux jumps occurring in the x and y measurements. Nearly all measurements in z which result in a magnetic charge in the range 0.2g D < |g| < 0.4g D are found to be correlated with a sudden jump in x or y (or both). The only effect of jumps in x and y was to add a new component to the resolution of the measurement in z, and recorded flux changes in the z direction due to magnetic dipoles contained in the samples were observed to remain unaffected. The instabilities in the x and y sensors were found to be related to two phenomena: the build up of static charge on the sample tray while it moved along the track; and the capture of stray fields in the magnetometer. In Summer 2017, to mitigate these effects, an upgrade was performed which included the installation of an anti-static brush along the sample holder track, shielding of all cables between the SQUIDs and electronics, and grounding of the metallic magnetic shields. This was indeed observed to result in improved instrument performance and will be beneficial for future measurements. It also changed some of the conditions for test measurements performed after the upgrade to understand the second effect described below.",

The mechanism causing the offset can be described as follows: whenever the sample magnetisation results in a flux inside the SQUID loop which temporarily exceeds the fundamental flux quantum 0 = h 2e 1 within a given margin, the response may not return to the same level during the flux change in the other direction. This happens with magnetised samples regardless of exposure to LHC collisions, although the conditions for the offset to occur are not easy to control and reproduce. Valuable insights were provided by tests performed with calibration samples with magnetisation corresponding to the range 10 3 g D -10 4 g D when the sample is inside the sensing coils, for which frequent offsets were observed, confirming that the offset probability depends on the sample magnetisation. Moreover, an increased speed of transport through the sensing coils was observed to increase the offset value. Fig. 2 shows the average of the absolute value of the offset as a function of speed for magnetised calibration samples, confirming this trend and supporting the hypothesis that the offset is related to trapped fluxes inside the SQUID that occur when the slew rate (or rate of flux change) is increased [27]. The offset value in the monopole search measurements was around \u00b11.8g D for a transport speed of 5.08 cm/s. The same offset was observed for measurements performed with the calibration samples (Fig. 2), although at higher speed, indicating that the offsets are mitigated by the magnetometer upgrade. In the present search, as can be seen in Fig. 1 (bottom), some candidates produced offsets more than once when remeasured. These particular candidates possess a higher magnetisation than average, corresponding to the range Fig. 3.

Moreover, the sign of the offset value in such candidates is reversed when turning the sample around such as to reverse its magnetisation in the z direction. These features are consistent with the effect induced by the sample magnetisation described above and inconsistent with the presence of a monopole, confirming that all 43 candidates are false positives. Special care is given to the assessment of the probability for false negatives, i.e., the possibility that a monopole in a sample would remain unseen in the first pass due to a spurious fluctuation cancelling its response and resulting in a persistent current below the 0.4g D threshold used to identify candidates. This is studied using the distribution of persistent currents obtained in samples without monopoles, assuming that the magnetic field of the monopole itself (small compared to those of magnetic dipoles contained in the sample and tray) does not affect the mismeasurement probability. A template for this distribution is obtained from the search data themselves (top panel of Fig. 1) since we established from the multiple measurements that none of the candidates are genuine. A fit of this distribution (\u03c7 2 /ndof = 0.74) is obtained using a sum of four Gaussians: two Gaussians centred around zero to describe the shape of the main peak and the broadening of the resolution due to random flux jumps, respectively; and two Gaussians centred around \u00b11.8g D to describe the occasional offsets. The probability to miss a monopole of charge g is then estimated by integrating the fitted function in the interval [\u2212g \u2212 0.4g D ; \u2212g + 0.4g D ] and dividing by the total number of samples (672). It is found to be less than 0.02% for a magnetic charge \u00b11g D , less than 1.5% for a magnetic charge \u00b12g D , and negligible for higher magnetic charges. These numbers could in principle be made even smaller by performing multiple measurements on all 629 non-candidate samples. However the level of detector efficiency obtained with the approach used is conservatively estimated to be 98%. This is considered adequate for the search being performed and this efficiency is assumed for the final interpretation.",

The reverse is true for monopoles with |g| > g D that predominantly stop in the upstream material and for which the acceptance is highest (up to 4% for |g| = 2g D , 2% for |g| = 3g D , and 1% for |g| = 4g D ) for intermediate masses (around 1000 GeV). The acceptance remains below 0.1% over the whole mass range for monopoles carrying a charge of 6g D or higher because they cannot be produced with sufficient energy to traverse the material upstream of the trapping volume. In this case the systematic uncertainties become too large and the interpretation ceases to be meaningful. The spin dependence is solely due to the different event kinematics.",

The fiducial regions given in this reference are expected to be identical except for the upper bounds in energy, which are generally not relevant because most monopoles in the collisions are produced at lower energies. They can thus conservatively be used to provide an interpretation which does not depend on the monopole production model.

No genuine candidates were found. Consequently, monopole-pair direct production crosssection upper limits in the range 40-10 5 fb were set for magnetic charges up to 5g D and masses up to 6 TeV. The possibility of spin-1 monopoles was considered for the first time in addition to spin-0 and spin-1/2, using a Drell-Yan pair-production model. Monopole Table 1 95% confidence level mass limits in models of spin-0, spin-1/2 and spin-1 monopole pair production in LHC pp collisions. The present results (after 2016 exposure) are interpreted for Drell-Yan production with both \u03b2-independent and \u03b2-dependent couplings. These limits are based upon cross sections computed at leading order and are only indicative since the monopole coupling to the photon is too large to allow for perturbative calculations. Previous results obtained at the LHC are from Refs. [23,24] (MoEDAL in previous exposures) and Ref. [22]  mass limits in the range 490-1790 GeV were obtained assuming cross sections at leading order -the strongest to date at a collider experiment [42] for charges ranging from two to five times the Dirac charge.",
