The observables have been chosen to emphasize the tt production process and to be sensitive to effects of initial-and final-state radiation, to the different parton distribution functions, and to non-resonant processes and higher-order corrections. The dataset corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb \u22121 , recorded in 2012 with the ATLAS detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. Events are selected in the lepton+jets channel, requiring exactly one charged lepton and at least four jets with at least two of the jets tagged as originating from a b-quark. The measured spectra are corrected for detector effects and are compared to several Monte Carlo simulations. The results are in fair agreement with the predictions over a wide kinematic range. Nevertheless, most generators predict a harder top-quark transverse momentum distribution at high values than what is observed in the data. Predictions beyond NLO accuracy improve the agreement with data at high top-quark transverse momenta. Using the current settings and parton distribution functions, the rapidity distributions are not well modelled by any generator under consideration. However, the level of agreement is improved when more recent sets of parton distribution functions are used.",

Furthermore, effects beyond the SM can appear as modifications of tt differential distributions with respect to the SM predictions [1] which may not be detectable with an inclusive cross-section measurement. A precise measurement of the tt differential cross-section therefore has the potential to enhance the sensitivity to possible effects beyond the SM, as well as to clarify the ability of the theoretical calculations in describing the cross-section.",

The results, unfolded both to a fiducial particle-level phase space and to the full phase space, are compared to the predictions of Monte Carlo (MC) generators and to perturbative QCD calculations beyond the next-to-leading-order (NLO) approximation. The goal of unfolding to a fiducial particle-level phase space and of using variables directly related to detector observables is to allow precision tests of QCD, avoiding large modeldependent extrapolation corrections to the parton-level topquark and to a phase space region outside the detector sensitivity. However, full phase-space measurements represent a valid test of higher-order calculations for which event generation with subsequent parton showering and hadronization is not yet available. A subset of the observables under consideration has been measured by CMS [5].",

The h damp parameter in the Powheg+Herwig sample is set to infinity. The uncertainties due to QCD initial-and final-state radiation (ISR/FSR) modelling are estimated with samples generated with Powheg-Box interfaced to Pythia for which the parameters of the generation ( QCD , Q 2 max scale, transverse momentum scale for space-like parton-shower evolution and the h damp parameter) are varied to span the ranges compatible with the results of measurements of tt production in association with jets [24][25][26].

Isolation requirements, on calorimeter and tracking variables, are used to reduce the background from non-prompt electrons. The calorimeter isolation variable is based on the energy sum of cells within a cone of size R < 0.2 around the direction of each electron candidate. This energy sum excludes cells associated with the electron cluster and is corrected for leakage from the electron cluster itself and for energy deposits from pile-up. The tracking isolation variable is based on the track p T sum around the electron in a cone of size R < 0.3, excluding the electron track. In every p T bin both requirements are chosen to result separately in a 90 % electron selection efficiency for prompt electrons from Z boson decays.",
