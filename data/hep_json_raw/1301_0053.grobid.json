The results show that the dominant 0 ++ and 2 ++ components are from the f0(1710), f0(2100), f0(1500), f \u2032 2 (1525), f2(1810) and f2(2340). The resonance parameters and branching fractions are also presented.",

            "text": "Our present understanding of the strong interaction is based on a non-Abelian gauge field theory, Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), which describes the interactions of quarks and gluons; it also predicts the existence of new types of hadrons with explicit gluonic degrees of freedom (eg. glueballs, hybrids and multi-quarks) [1][2][3][4][5]. These unconventional states, if they exist, will enrich the meson spectroscopy greatly and shed light on the dynamics of QCD. According to lattice QCD predictions [6,7], the lowest mass glueball with J P C = 0 ++ is in the mass region from 1.5 to 1.7 GeV/c 2 . However, the mixing of the pure glueball with nearby qq nonet mesons makes the identification of the glueballs difficult in both experiment and theory. Radiative J/\u03c8 decay is a gluon-rich process and has long been regarded as one of the most promising hunting grounds for glueballs. In particular, for a J/\u03c8 radiative decay to two pseudoscalar mesons, it offers a very clean laboratory to search for scalar and tensor glueballs because only intermediate states with J P C = even ++ are possible. An early study of J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7\u03b7 was made by the Crystal Ball Collaboration [8] with the first observation of f 0 (1710), but the study suffered from low statistics.",

The scalar contributions are mainly from f 0 (1500), f 0 (1710) and f 0 (2100), while no evident contributions from f 0 (1370) and f 0 (1790) are seen. Recently, the production rate of the pure gauge scalar glueball in J/\u03c8 radiative decays predicted by the lattice QCD [35] was found to be compatible with the production rate of J/\u03c8 radiative decays to f 0 (1710); this suggests that f 0 (1710) has a larger overlap with the glueball compared to other glueball candidates (eg. f 0 (1500)). In this analysis, the production rate of f 0 (1710) and f 0 (2100) are both about one order of magnitude larger than that of the f 0 (1500) and no clear evidence is found for f 0 (1370), which are both consistent with, at least not contrary to, lattice QCD predictions.",
