The data analysed correspond to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb \u22121 collected with the CMS detector at the LHC in proton-proton collisions at \u221a s = 8 TeV. The hadronic decay products of the top quark with high Lorentz boost from the W boson decay are detected as a single top flavoured jet. The use of jet substructure algorithms allows the top quark jet to be distinguished from standard model QCD background. Limits on the production cross section of a right-handed W boson are obtained, together with constraints on the left-handed and right-handed couplings of the W boson to quarks. The production of a right-handed W boson with a mass below 2.02 TeV decaying to a hadronic final state is excluded at 95% confidence level. This mass limit increases to 2.15 TeV when both hadronic and leptonic decays are considered, and is the most stringent lower mass limit to date in the tb decay mode.",

The W boson, for example, is a heavy partner of the SM W gauge boson that could manifest itself in proton-proton collisions at the CERN LHC. Searches for a high-mass W boson resonance have been performed at the Tevatron [4,5] and the LHC [6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15] in the lepton, diboson, and diquark final states. We present a search based on the W + \u2192 tb (and charge conjugate) decay. This decay channel is of particular interest because the SM backgrounds can be greatly reduced compared to those for W decays to light quarks, and some models predict a stronger W coupling to third generation quarks [16]. The hadronic decay channel (W \u2192 tb \u2192 qqbb) is presented in detail, along with the combination with the already published leptonic channel (W \u2192 tb \u2192 \u03bdbb) [6]. The combination of these two channels leads to a significant increase in sensitivity.",

For a SM-like W boson, a L q i q j = 1, a R q i q j = 0. Strict cross section upper limits have previously been placed in the case of low mass W signals [5,6]. At higher masses, specifically M W 1.3 TeV, the top quark is highly energetic. Because of the Lorentz boost, the angular separation between the top quark decay products (W boson and b quark) is small. The final state particles resulting from the hadronization of the b quark and the decay of the W boson into light quarks usually overlap, resulting in a single jet with top flavour, the \"top quark jet\", or t jet. Dedicated methods, applied to resolve the substructure of this t jet, enable background processes to be strongly suppressed. We apply b jet identification algorithms (b tagging) to the b jet from the W decay in order to further reduce the SM background.",
