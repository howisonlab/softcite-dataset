            "text": "Heavy quarkonium states are particularly interesting systems to test our understanding of strong interactions, both at perturbative and non-perturbative level, and are therefore the subject of intense theoretical and experimental studies. An effective field theory, non-relativistic QCD (NRQCD) [1,2], provides the foundation for much of the current theoretical work. According to NRQCD, the production of heavy quarkonium factorises into two steps: a heavy quark-antiquark pair is first created at short distances and subsequently evolves non-perturbatively into quarkonium at long distances. The NRQCD calculations include colour-singlet (CS) and colour-octet (CO) amplitudes (see [3] and references therein), which account for the probability of a heavy quark-antiquark pair in a particular colour state to evolve into a heavy quarkonium state. The CS model (CSM) was initially used to describe experimental data. However, it underestimates the observed cross-section for single J/\u03c8 production at high transverse momentum (p T ). To resolve this discrepancy, the CO mechanism was introduced. More recent higherorder calculations to the CS predictions raise substantially the cross-sections at large p T bringing them closer to the experimental data. However, none of these approaches can reproduce in a consistent way the available experimental results on both cross-section and polarisation (see [3] and references therein, [4]).",

The measurements are performed in the range of rapidity 2.0 < y < 4.5 and p T < 14 GeV/c for the J/\u03c8 meson and p T < 15 GeV/c for the \u03a5(nS ), in bins of p T and y with bin sizes \u2206p T = 1 GeV/c and \u2206y = 0.5. The fraction of J/\u03c8 from b (abbreviated as \"from b\" in the following) is also measured in the same fiducial region. The \u03a5(nS ) meson analysis is based on a data sample, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of about 51 pb \u22121 of pp interactions, while the analysis for the more abundant J/\u03c8 mesons is based on data, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of about 18 pb \u22121 . The J/\u03c8 and \u03a5(nS ) mesons are reconstructed through their decay into a pair of muons following the strategy described in Refs. [7,9,10]. The resulting dimuon invariant mass distributions are displayed in Figs.1 and 2 for the J/\u03c8 and \u03a5(nS ) mesons. The invariant mass resolution is on average 13.5 MeV/c 2 for the J/\u03c8 and 43 MeV/c 2 for the \u03a5(1S ) meson.",

In these comparisons the predictions are for direct J/\u03c8 meson production, i.e., they do not include feed-down from higher charmonium states, whereas the experimental measurements do include feed-down.

The \u03c8(2S ) production from b-hadron decays is distinguished from promptly produced charmonium by exploiting the b-hadron finite decay time. The interest of measuring \u03c8(2S ) production arises from the fact that no significant feed-down from excited charmonium states is expected, which facilitates the comparison with theoretical model. Figures 8 and 9 show the differential production cross-section as a function of p T for prompt \u03c8(2S ) and \u03c8(2S ) from b-hadron-decays. The data are compared with various theoretical models: MWC [22] and KB [15] are NLO NRQCD calculations, while AL [16,17] is a CSM including the dominant NNLO terms.

This was studied by LHCb using an integrated luminosity of about 37 pb \u22121 of pp interactions at 7 TeV [23]. Simultaneous production of two J/\u03c8 mesons can be expected in single parton collisions via higher order O(\u03b1 4 s ) gluon-gluon diagrams. This production could also be enhanced by double parton scattering (DPS) in which two gluons are extracted from a proton and the two J/\u03c8 mesons are produced in two independent sub-processes. The cross-section for double J/\u03c8 production in the fiducial range 2 < y J/\u03c8 < 4.5 and p J/\u03c8 T < 10 GeV/c is measured to be \u03c3 J/\u03c8 J/\u03c8 = 5.1 \u00b1 1.0 \u00b1 1.1nb [23], where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second is systematic, in good agreement with predictions from leading-order QCD calculations [24].

LHCb is very well suited for this type of studies as it has access to high rapidities, with some sensitivity to backward tracks using the Vertex Locator (VELO), it operates at relatively low pileup and has sensitivity to low momentum and transverse momentum particles. Exclusively produced J/\u03c8 and \u03c8(2S ) mesons into dimuons are characterised by a very distinct topology: their selection requires the presence of two reconstructed muons in the forward region and no other tracks and photons in the detector. An additional rapidity gap is obtained by also excluding tracks in the backward region using the VELO detector. Based on a data sample, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of about 36 pb \u22121 of pp interactions, the cross-sections times branching fractions to two muons for exclusive J/\u03c8 and \u03c8(2S ) with pseudorapidities between 2.0 and 4.5 is measured to be \u03c3 pp\u2192J/\u03c8 (\u2192\u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) = 307 \u00b1 21 \u00b1 36 pb and \u03c3 pp\u2192\u03c8(2S )(\u2192\u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) = 7.8 \u00b1 1.3 \u00b1 1.0 pb, where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second is systematic, in good agreement with theoretical predictions [27][28][29][30]. During the 2012 run, a new trigger was implemented to increase the rate of exclusive events, which makes use of \"upstream\" silicon sensors to veto any backward activity 15005-p.4 and of soft p T cuts to gain sensitivity for hadronic final states. Data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of about 1.4 fb \u22121 were already collected with such a trigger, which will allow LHCb to study the production of charmonium decaying into hadronic final states, the production of open charm and to perform a search for higher mass charmonium states. The protonnucleon centre-of-mass system has a rapidity in the laboratory frame of +0.47 for pA and -0.47 for Ap collisions, resulting in a rapidity coverage in the laboratory frame ranging from about 1.5 to 4.0 for pA collisions and from -5.0 to -2.5 for Ap collisions. The analysis is based on data samples corresponding to integrated luminosities of 0.75 nb \u22121 of pA and 0.30 nb \u22121 of Ap collisions. The double-differential production is measured for prompt J/\u03c8 and J/\u03c8 from b in bins of the kinematic variables y and p T . The measured cross-sections for prompt J/\u03c8 production integrated over y and p T , scaled by a factor of 1/A and rescaled to the common rapidity range of the protonnucleon system 2.5 < y < 4.0 for pp and pA collisions and \u22124.0 < y < \u22122.5 for Ap collisions are shown is Fig.12 as a function of \u221a s NN . The results indicate that the J/\u03c8 production cross-section is suppressed in protonlead collisions, as expected from previous experiments; however such suppression is less enhanced in the backward region. One can also derive the attenuation factor",

A simple CSM is disfavoured by the data, while a combination of CS and CO, as implemented in the NRQCD formalism, or CS improved by QCD corrections, provide a good description of prompt 15005-p. 5 LHCP 2013 quarkonium production. Charmonium production from bhadron decays is very well reproduced by FONLL calculations. Some other studies were illustrated in this report, such as charmonium exclusive production [26], double J/\u03c8 production [23], as well as first preliminary results on J/\u03c8 production in proton-lead collisions at \u221a s NN = 5 TeV [31]. Many of these results are based on the analysis of a partial dataset and will gain in precision with the analysis of the full data sample available to LHCb.",

Data were collected with a proton beam energy of 4 TeV and a lead beam energy of 1.58 TeV per nucleon, resulting in a centre-of-mass energy of the proton-nucleon system of 5 TeV. The directions of the proton and lead beams were swapped during data taking to produce both pA and Ap collisions. Data collected with the inverted beam directions (i.e., in Ap collision) allow LHCb to measure backward production.",
