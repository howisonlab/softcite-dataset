A data sample of proton-proton collisions at \u221a s = 13 TeV recorded with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider between 2015 and 2018, corresponding to a total integrated luminosity of 139 fb \u22121 , is used for the search. No significant excess over the Standard Model expectation is observed. The results are interpreted in simplified supersymmetric models featuring both R-parity conservation and R-parity violation, raising the exclusion limits beyond those of previous ATLAS searches to 1600 GeV for gluino masses and 750 GeV for bottom and top squark masses in these scenarios.",

            "text": "Experimental searches for manifestations of physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM physics) at hadron colliders have long exploited the signature of final states comprising a pair of isolated light leptons (electrons, muons) with the same electric charge ('same-sign leptons'). In the Standard Model (SM), production of prompt same-sign lepton pairs from weak-boson decays is rare. In the context of \u221a s = 13 TeV pp collisions, the inclusive crosssection is of the order of 1 pb [1,2], thus suppressed by more than three orders of magnitude relative to the production of opposite-sign lepton pairs. By constrast, in many scenarios heavy BSM particles, which may be produced in proton-proton (pp) collisions, decay into multiple massive SM bosons or top quarks. The subsequent decays of these heavy SM particles into same-sign leptons and jets may then occur with significant branching ratios. Pair production of heavy BSM Majorana fermions can be another abundant source of events with same-sign leptons [3]. At the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) [4], signatures with same-sign prompt leptons have been used by the ATLAS [5] and CMS [6] experiments to explore the landscape of possible SM extensions and their phenomenology. Among these proposed extensions, supersymmetry (SUSY) [7][8][9][10][11][12] stands out as a particularly compelling framework. It was shown [13][14][15][16] to favourably impact the scale evolution of perturbative gauge couplings needed for the unification of strong and electroweak interactions, and can address the SM -1 -",

In addition, large missing transverse momentum is required in the case of R-parity-conserving models. The event selection also relies on the number of b-tagged jets. Signal regions (SRs) are built (section 4) from a set of requirements on the kinematic properties of the selected events, in order to isolate the signature of supersymmetric processes from SM backgrounds. The latter are estimated with Monte Carlo simulation for processes such as ttV or V V (V = W, Z) leading to prompt same-sign leptons (section 5), while sources of same-sign leptons arising from jets misidentified as leptons or non-prompt leptons from decays of hadrons, as well as other reducible backgrounds, are estimated with data (section 6). Event yields in data are then compared with the estimated contributions from SM processes. The results are presented in section 7 for 139 fb \u22121 of 13 TeV pp collision data recorded by the ATLAS experiment.

            "text": "The ATLAS experiment [5] at the LHC is a multipurpose particle detector with a forwardbackward symmetric cylindrical geometry and a near 4\u03c0 coverage in solid angle. 2 It consists of an inner tracking detector (ID) surrounded by a thin superconducting solenoid providing a 2 T axial magnetic field, electromagnetic (EM) and hadron calorimeters, and a muon spectrometer (MS). The ID covers the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 2.5. It consists of silicon pixel, silicon microstrip, and transition radiation tracking detectors, completed by the insertable B-layer (IBL) installed before Run 2 [31,32]. Lead/liquid-argon (LAr) sampling calorimeters provide EM energy measurements with high granularity. A steel/scintillatortile hadron calorimeter covers the central pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 1.7. The endcap and forward regions are instrumented with LAr calorimeters for EM and hadronic energy measurements up to |\u03b7| = 4.9. The MS surrounds the calorimeters and is based on three large air-core toroidal superconducting magnets with eight coils each. The field integral of the toroids ranges between 2.0 and 6.0 T\u2022m across most of the detector. The MS includes a system of precision tracking chambers and fast detectors for triggering. A two-level trigger system [33] is used to select events. The first-level trigger is implemented in hardware and uses a subset of the detector information to reduce the accepted rate to at most 100 kHz. This is followed by a software-based trigger that reduces the accepted event rate to 1 kHz on average depending on the data-taking conditions.",

After requirements on the stability of the beams, the operational status of all ATLAS detector components, and the quality of the recorded data, the total integrated luminosity of the dataset corresponds to 139 fb \u22121 with an uncertainty of 1.7%. It is obtained [34] using the LUCID-2 detector [35] for the primary luminosity measurements. Proton-proton interaction vertices are reconstructed from charged-particle tracks in the ID with p T > 500 MeV [36,37]. The presence of at least one such vertex with a minimum of two associated tracks is required, and the primary vertex is chosen as the vertex with the largest sum of p 2 T of associated tracks. The anti-k t algorithm [38] with radius parameter R = 0.4 implemented in the FastJet library [39] is used to reconstruct jets up to |\u03b7| = 4.9, relying on topological energy clusters in the calorimeter [40] at the EM scale. Jets are then calibrated as described in ref. [41]. Only jets with p T > 20 GeV are further considered. Events are vetoed when containing jets induced by calorimeter noise or non-collision background, according to criteria similar to those described in ref. [42]. As decay products of heavy particles tend to be more central, this analysis only considers jets with |\u03b7| < 2.8 in multiplicity-based requirements. An additional discriminant referred to as the Jet Vertex Tagger (JVT) is used to exclude jets produced in pile-up processes [43], based on classifying the tracks associated with the jet as pointing or not pointing to the primary vertex.",

For events with E miss T < 250 GeV, only lepton-based triggers without isolation requirements are used, with lepton p T thresholds which vary over the data collected in Run 2 up to a maximum of 24 GeV for triggers requiring two electrons, 22 GeV for the leading-p T muon in triggers requiring two muons, and 17 GeV (14 GeV) for the electron (muon) in mixed dilepton triggers. For events with E miss T > 250 GeV, triggers based on E miss T are also used. For events that are only accepted by lepton triggers with p T requirements above 20 GeV, the analysis-level lepton p T requirement is raised to be 1 GeV above the trigger threshold. This results in a relative reduction of the total fiducial acceptance by at most 2% for the benchmark signal scenarios of figure 1. For signal events selected in the SRs presented below, the trigger efficiency is above 95% for R-parity-conserving models, and above 93% otherwise. For signal events with E miss T > 250 GeV, the trigger efficiency is above 99%. Five SRs are built to isolate signatures of hypothetical supersymmetric signal processes from backgrounds; their definitions are summarised in table 1. They rely on the multiplicities of different reconstructed objects such as the number of leptons n and their relative electric charges, the number of jets n j with p T > 25 or 40 GeV, and the number of b-tagged jets n b with p T > 20 GeV. Several kinematic variables are also used: the effective -5 - mass m eff consisting of the scalar p T sum of all jets and leptons added to E miss T , the E miss T itself and its ratio to m eff , and the invariant mass of same-sign electron pairs, m e \u00b1 e \u00b1 . The latter helps to reduce the backgrounds featuring a Z \u2192 e + e \u2212 decay where the charge of one electron is mismeasured. The SR requirements were chosen loosely so as to provide sensitivity to non-excluded regions of the parameter space for the processes illustrated in figure 1, while preserving sensitivity to other SUSY processes with possibly different final states, as in table 1. The SR Rpv2L targets gluino pair production in R-parity-violating scenarios, hence without any E miss T requirement. It is inclusive in terms of b-tagged jets to be sensitive to various decay modes of gluinos leading to final states with leptons and jets, such as the scenario illustrated in figure 1(d) or the few other examples mentioned in table 1. In this SR, a tight requirement on the effective mass m eff > 2.6 TeV is used to reduce SM backgrounds.",

[74] was used, relying on the DPS effective cross-section \u03c3 eff [75]. Earlier experiments probed the reliability of this approach for different centre-of-mass energies and physics processes [76], including more recently for W \u00b1 W \u00b1 production [77]. All these measurements display a level of consistency allowing to conclude that DPS processes would not contribute noticeably to the SRs. For pile-up interactions, the estimation was based on the longitudinal density of reconstructed vertices [78], as the impact parameter requirements in the selection of the leptons strongly affect the yields of such processes.

These contributions were studied by running the Photos++ QED shower program [81] on the tree-level decay products of top quarks generated with MadGraph 2.6 or Pythia 8. The fraction of events in which an additional lepton is produced drops sharply with the p T requirement for that lepton; for a p T = 10 GeV threshold 4 this fraction was found to be \u223c 0.2%, a similar order of magnitude to that quoted in ref. [81]. An additional isolation requirement similar to that used in the analysis reduces this rate by a factor of three. This represents less than 2% (4%) of the inclusive contribution from ttV processes for final states with same-sign (three) leptons; furthermore, the smaller reconstruction and identification efficiencies for low-p T leptons should further reduce the radiative top quark decay contribution relative to ttV processes. The expected contribution to the SRs is therefore small enough to be neglected.",

The latter are Gaussian distributions for all sources, including statistical uncertainties arising from the limited number of preselected or opposite-sign data events in the estimation of the reducible background, or the limited number of simulated events. Correlations of a given nuisance parameter between the backgrounds and the signal are taken into account when relevant. Table 6 presents 95% CL upper limits on the number of BSM events, S 95 , that may contribute to the SRs. Normalising these by the integrated luminosity L of the data sample, they can be interpreted as upper limits on the visible BSM cross-section (\u03c3 vis ), defined as \u03c3 vis = \u03c3 prod \u00d7 A \u00d7 = S 95 /L, where \u03c3 prod is the production cross-section of an arbitrary BSM signal process, and A and are the corresponding fiducial acceptance and reconstruction efficiencies for the relevant SR. These limits are computed with asymptotic approximations of the probability distributions of the test statistic under the different hypotheses [84].

            "text": "Exclusion limits are computed for the masses of superpartners involved in the benchmark SUSY signal scenarios shown in figure 1, using the same statistical tools as those described in section 7. The limits are obtained in the context of simplified models [86][87][88] assuming a single production process with 100% branching ratio into the chosen decay mode, and where superpartners not involved in the process are treated as decoupled. All superpartners are assumed to decay promptly. The expected signal contributions to the SRs are estimated from simulated Monte Carlo samples produced with the MadGraph5 aMC@NLO 2.2.1 generator using LO matrix elements for the signal process with up to two extra partons. Parton shower, hadronisation and modelling of the underlying event were performed using the Pythia 8.230 generator [56] with the A14 tune [59], using the CKKW-L matching prescription [89] with a matching scale set to one quarter of the mass of the gluinos or squarks produced in the interaction. The samples were processed through a fast simulation of the ATLAS detector using a parameterisation of the calorimeter response but Geant4 for the ID and MS [66,90]. Such an approach is known to be appropriate for the standard reconstruction techniques described in section 3, and alternative corrections and scale factors to those evoked in sections 3 and 5 are employed. The samples are normalised to the 'NNLO approx +NNLL' reference cross-sections [27], which combine near-threshold approximate next-to-next-to-leading-order corrections [91] to the NLO cross-section with a resummation of soft gluon divergences at next-to-next-to-leading-logarithm accuracy [27]. Corresponding uncertainties are taken from envelopes of cross-section predictions using different PDF sets and factorisation and renormalisation scales, as described in ref. [70]. They range from 12% to 20% for gluino masses from 1 to 2 TeV, and from 7% to 11% for top or bottom squark masses from 400 GeV to 1 TeV.    Figure 8. 95% CL exclusion limits on the production of pairs of third-generation squarks, assuming production cross-sections as in ref.

For gluino masses around the exclusion limits, the signal A \u00d7 is as large as 0.9% for Rpc2L0b and 0.7% for Rpv2L. Exclusion limits on the masses of third-generation squarks are shown in figure 8.
