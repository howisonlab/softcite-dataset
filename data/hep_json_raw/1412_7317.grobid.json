            "text": "Exotic hadrons consisting of five quarks were proposed on the basis of quark and bag models [1][2][3] in the early days of QCD. Predictions based on the Skyrme model [4][5][6][7] generated renewed interest in the possible existence of such manifestly exotic baryon states, and chiral-soliton calculations suggested a narrow resonance at \u223c1530 MeV [8], named \u0398 \u00fe . Possible experimental evidence for this state came from the observation of a narrow peak at 1.54 AE 0.01 GeV in both the K \u2212 and K \u00fe missing-mass spectrum for the \u03b3n \u2192 K \u00fe K \u2212 n reaction on 12 C [9]. This observation provoked a series of reports of experimental sightings and theoretical predictions for such states. Increased experimental scrutiny failed to confirm most of these initial reports, and it is now generally accepted that there is no substantial evidence for the existence of the \u0398 \u00fe state [10,11].",

The target consisted of an open-ended elliptical storage cell that was aligned coaxially to the lepton beam. The cell was fed by polarized or unpolarized gas. The polarized target used an atomic beam source [14], which could produce luminosities of the order of 10 31 to 10 32 cm 2 =s. Unpolarized data were obtained using an unpolarized gas feed system, operating with up to 3 orders of magnitude higher luminosities. An integrated luminosity of \u223c500 pb \u22121 , corresponding to 28.4 million deep-inelastic scattering (DIS) events, was collected on a longitudinally polarized (unpolarized) deuterium target over the years 1998-2000 (2006-2007). With the hydrogen target approximately twice the luminosity was collected, corresponding to 54.9 million DIS events accumulated over the years 2002-2005 (2006-2007) on a transversely polarized (unpolarized) target. Polarized data were summed over the spin orientations.",

Advances in several aspects of the techniques of the experiment reported there increase the sensitivity in the search for new baryon resonances. In the original measurement, particle identification was accomplished with reconstruction of the event response of the HERMES ring-imaging Cherenkov detector (RICH) [15] on a track-by-track basis. This approach was dictated by the limited computing capability available at that time. However, this technique does not account for complications in particle identification caused by overlapping Cherenkov rings from two or more tracks in the same detector half. By its nature, the search reported here focuses on events with at least three tracks. In the analysis presented, the defect is remedied by the implementation of a more advanced method of particle identification, in which the response pattern in the RICH is reconstructed with simultaneous generation of the response to all the tracks present in an event [16]. In this way, possible track-to-track cross-talk is accounted for and the efficiency and purity of the RICH particle identification is improved.",

The number of counts under the peak was fitted, and input and output numbers were compared. The average peak position found is 1521.8 AE 4.3 MeV with a width of the Breit-Wigner function 5.5 AE 12.5 MeV. A significance of this peak of 1.9\u03c3 is obtained from the difference between maximumlikelihood values from unbinned fits [19] with and without the peak function accompanying a smooth background shape. A value of 2.2\u03c3 is obtained when it is estimated from many trials using a Monte Carlo simulation with an event generator giving a smooth shape and each trial fitted with a peak plus background shape, in order to determine the probability to produce a fake peak with a strength equal to or larger than 68, the number of signal events resulting from the fit. Taken together, all these methods show that the significance of a signal for a potential resonant structure at 1521.8 MeV is about 2\u03c3 for the HERMES deuterium data.",

The original data set taken in the years 1998-2000 has been combined with an additional data set taken in the years 2006-2007, resulting in nearly twice as many events as in the original measurement. As a result of the improved tracking and kinematic reconstruction methods, the invariantmass spectrum of K 0 S is obtained with significantly less background and better mass resolution. The significance of the potential resonance structure in the M\u00f0pK 0 S \u00de spectrum of the deuterium data near the 1522 MeV region is about 2\u03c3, compared to the previously published significance of 3.7\u03c3 [12].
