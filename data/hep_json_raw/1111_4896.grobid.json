The HBOM method is a model-independent and potentially data-driven technique that repeatedly applies a parameterisation of the detector effect to observed data. The correction is determined by extrapolating the data so-obtained to a detector effect of zero. We demonstrate this technique using the two particle correlation function, which is an observable that can otherwise be difficult to correct for systematic shifts introduced by the detector.",

Such \"detector effects\" include energy and angular smearing, production of additional particles through secondary scatterings, and inefficiencies in the detection of particles. A measurement that contains detector artefacts is of less use than one that does not; in order to correctly compare such a result to either theoretical predictions or other measurements of the same observable, one needs access to a full description of the detector effects. Detailed knowledge about the detector, typically in the form of a sophisticated simulation package, usually only exists within the experimental collaboration responsible. There is no guarantee, or indeed expectation, that the detailed detector simulation will be available many years from now.",

Bin-by-bin unfolding has the advantages that it is easy to understand and can work quite effectively on simple observables. However, bin-by-bin unfolding does introduce a dependence on the Monte Carlo model(s) used to derive the bin-to-bin migration correction factors and, especially for more complicated observables, it tends to produce a bias in the shape of distributions.",

Flattening occurred because, in removing particles from events, the detector effect weakened the correlations observed. The amount of flattening decreases with each subsequent application of the detector. In order to arrive at an estimate of the true observable, such flattening had to be reversed. Conversely, the \u2206\u03c6 dependence of the two particle correlation function develops a somewhat sharper peak at \u2206\u03c6 = 0 (and correspondingly broader peak at \u2206\u03c6 = \u03c0) as the detector effect is increased. The different behaviour shown by the \u2206\u03b7 and \u2206\u03c6 dependence of the two particle correlation function illustrates why a simple re-scaling of the results tends not to work for complex observables. The value of the observable in each of its bins was plotted as a function of the number of times the detector parameterisation had been applied.

The corrected value thus obtained by using a mis-modelled detector to apply the correction is also shown in figure  4. In this example, when using a polynomial fit of degree four to the detector iterations curve, the mis-modelled alternative detector in-fact shows a slightly better agreement between the corrected and true observables. This better agreement occurs because the alternative parameterisation represents a stronger detector effect; a particle has an increased probability of being removed from the sample when using the alternative as opposed to nominal detector. The alternative correction therefore over-corrects relative to the nominal correction, however this effect cancels with the slight undercorrection provided by the nominal correction when using this particular polynomial fit to the iterations curve.",

For this note we used a heuristic approach to finding the fitting function, which recognises that no function is a-priori more correct than any other; we simply wanted a function that described the behaviour of the detector. The performance of the fitted function can be estimated either by obtaining the original un-corrected data distributions from the additional applications of the detector effect or by performing a closure test on a simulated sample of events; if the fit is good then the distributions obtained by passing hadron-level Monte Carlo events through a detector simulation and applying the correction procedure should agree with the original hadron-level results.

If such moving peaks are present in the observable then fitting an iterations curve independently to each bin of the observable may very well not be the optimum corrections strategy because it ignores information about the overall change in the shape of the distribution.
