The data set used in the analysis corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 20.2 fb \u22121 . The large multi-jet background is modelled using a data-driven method. The top-quark mass is obtained from template fits to the ratio of the three-jet to the dijet mass. The three-jet mass is obtained from the three jets assigned to the top quark decay. From these three jets the dijet mass is obtained using the two jets assigned to the W boson decay. The top-quark mass is measured to be 173.72 \u00b1 0.55 (stat.) \u00b1 1.01 (syst.) GeV.",

            "text": "Of all known fundamental particles, the top quark has the largest mass. Its existence was predicted in 1973 by Kobayashi and Maskawa [1], and it was not observed directly until 1995, by the CDF and D0 experiments at the Tevatron [2,3]. Since 2010, top quarks have also been observed at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) [4] at CERN. Due to the higher centre-of-mass energy, top quark production at the LHC is an order of magnitude larger than at the Tevatron. The large data sets of top-antitop quark (tt) pairs allow many precision studies and measurements of top quark properties. The Yukawa coupling of the top quark is predicted to be close to unity [5,6], suggesting that it may play a special role in electroweak symmetry breaking. In the Standard Model (SM), the top quark dominantly contributes to the quantum corrections to the Higgs self coupling [7,8]. Precise measurements of the top-quark mass (m top ) are therefore very important in probing the stability of the vacuum [9,10], and contribute to searches for signs of physics beyond the SM.",

Both lepton types are identified using the tight working points as specified in refs. [32,33]. Jets (j) are reconstructed using the anti-k t algorithm with radius parameter R = 0.4 [34] employing topological clusters [35] in the calorimeter. These jets are calibrated to the hadronic energy scale as described in refs. [36][37][38]. The four-vector of the highest-energy muon (\u00b5) from among those matched within \u2206R(j, \u00b5) < 0.3 to a reconstructed jet, is added to the reconstructed jet four-vector. This is done to compensate for the energy losses in the calorimeter arising from semimuonic quark decays.

This \u2206\u03c6 cut is very powerful in rejecting combinatorial background events; most of these are true tt events where the incorrect jets are associated with the top quark. Finally, a cut is applied based on the azimuthal angle between b-jets and their associated W boson candidate: the average of the two angular separations for each event is required to satisfy \u2206\u03c6(b, W ) < 2. Here the b, and the W are the 4-vectors of a b-jet and a W , identified by means of the three-jet combination that best fits the tt event hypothesis described in section 5. This \u2206\u03c6 cut rejects a large fraction of events from the multi-jet and combinatorial backgrounds, as well as events from non-all-hadronic tt decays. Events failing this final selection cut are, however retained for the purpose of modelling the multi-jet background, as detailed in section 6.

To quantify the expected change in the measured m top value due to a different choice of hadronisation model, pseudo experiments are performed for two independent MC samples both employing POWHEG-BOX AFII simulation to generate the all-hadronic tt events but differing in their choice of hadronisation model. In the first case, Pythia 6.427 [28] is used to model the parton shower, hadronisation and underlying event with the Perugia 2012 tunes [29], while in the second case, Herwig 6.520.2 with the AUET2 tune [48] is used. The absolute difference of 0.64 GeV between the average m top values obtained in the two cases is accounted for as the systematic uncertainty.  Table 3. Summary of all sources of statistical and systematic uncertainties in the measured values of the top-quark mass. Totals are evaluated by means of a sum in quadrature and assuming that all contributions are uncorrelated. The uncertainties are subdivided into three categories: theory and modelling uncertainties, method-related uncertainties, and calibration-or detectorrelated uncertainties, as described in the text. Adjacent to each of the quoted systematic variations in m top is its associated statistical uncertainty. The ABCDEF method is further described in section 9.2 and in ref. [17]. The quoted statistical uncertainty is corrected for the correlation between the two R 3/2 measurements of each event.",

Uncertainties in the calibration scales and in the resolutions of the lepton (e/\u00b5) four-vector objects [33,53,54] can potentially lead to small differences in the event selection or the jet-quark assignment in the top reconstruction algorithm. Similarly, small uncertainties in m top can be expected due to the uncertainties in the scale and resolution of the E miss T soft term [39,40]. The E miss T soft term is varied according to these uncertainties and pseudo experiments are performed with the modified MC events. In the case of the muon-related uncertainties, Gaussian smearing is performed to assess the impact on the final result. The maximum absolute deviation from the reference m top value is taken as the uncertainty in each case, and these are added in quadrature to obtain a single value of 0.02 GeV for all lepton-and E miss T -related scale and resolution uncertainties.",

By drawing pseudo events from the parameterisations an offset of about 80 MeV in the mass difference (m meas top \u2212 m gen top ) is present (see figure 5). The offset does not exhibit a dependence on the generator's m top value. For this reason the parameter value returned from a fit to the average bias from pseudo experiments across m gen top is subtracted from the final m top value as measured in data. The final value of m top quoted in this analysis includes this subtraction. The uncertainty in this fitted offset is then quoted as the systematic uncertainty of 0.06 GeV associated with the template method's non-closure.",
