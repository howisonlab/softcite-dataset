The seasonal modulation of the signal has also been studied observing a positive correlation with the atmospheric temperature, leading to an effective temperature coefficient of \u03b1 T = 0.212 \u00b1 0.024 and 0.355 \u00b1 0.019 for the near and far detectors respectively. These measurements, in good agreement with expectations based on theoretical models, represent one of the first measurements of this coefficient in shallow depth installations.",

            "text": "Muons created by cosmic rays in the atmosphere and muon-induced events are one of the main concerns regarding background in neutrino experiments. The impact of these events on the research of the expected signals is usually reduced by placing the experimental set-ups in deep underground facilities. However, a precise identification of these events for further rejection is required, especially in cases where the detector is installed on the surface or at shallow depth, with the muon flux remaining high. Total expected rate, flux and muon angular distributions are some of the information that can be valuable for muon characterization. Empirically, some of this information can already be obtained by various methods and by the development of dedicated muon reconstruction algorithms optimized for the detector features. This information can be complemented by performing corresponding simulations. From the digitized overburdens of Double Chooz near and far detectors showed in figure 1 and their composition, the corresponding mean depths can be estimated as \u223c120 and \u223c300 m.w.e. respectively. These low overburdens imply that a significant quantity of muons still reaches the detectors. In fact, most of the background events recorded by Double Chooz detectors are directly related to muons [1]. Furthermore, for these shallow depth installations, the overburden profile should also be taken into account. Profile irregularities can imply that the corresponding depth for a given direction would be significantly different from the mean value. In the case of muons this effect implies two main consequences: inhomogeneities in the muon incident angle distribution, and differences in the energy threshold of muons reaching the detector with respect to the estimated value from the mean overburden. These effects are more identifiable in the case that the overburden decreases significantly for a given direction (as it is the case of the far detector as observed in Figure 1), since for this direction more muons would be detected and the corresponding muon energy threshold will be lower than the estimated by the mean depth, implying that lower energy muons should be taken into account in the corresponding muon studies. Because both Double Chooz experimental halls are shallow depth installations, an accurate characterization of muons reaching the corresponding detectors is important, considering the above mentioned particularities. Taking advantage of the long period of time that Double Chooz detectors have been taking data (\u223c151 days for the near detector and \u223c673 days for the far one), it is possible to perform, for the first time, an extended study of muons at shallow depth installations, including the estimation of the muon flux and the corresponding angular distributions. Moreover, the long data taking period also allows the study of the seasonal effect on the muon rate. Due to the temperature variations in the atmosphere during the year, the density of the atmosphere is expected to vary, being lower in summer and increasing the mesons' mean free path. This effect leads to an expected increase of muons reaching the detectors in summer, when the temperature is higher. The correlation between detected muon rate and atmospheric temperature permits the estimation of the effective temperature coefficient (\u03b1 T ). It can be compared with theoretical estimations for a lower muon energy threshold (22.3 GeV for the near detector and 46.0 GeV for the far one based on simulations described in section 4) than those studied by experiments located deep underground, with energy thresholds closer to the TeV scale. These studies can be complemented by corresponding simulations, whose comparison with experimental data provides a validation of the muon transport simulation in a wider energy range, since lower energy muons should be taken into account in Double Chooz.",

These detectors are composed of a set of concentric cylinders with an outer muon veto on top. The neutrino target (NT) is the innermost volume and contains 8.3 tons of Gd-loaded (0.1 %) liquid scintillator inside a transparent acrylic vessel, where the neutrinos interact via the inverse beta-decay (IBD) process. The NT is surrounded by another acrylic vessel, the gamma catcher (GC), filled with unloaded scintillator, which is in turn surrounded by a buffer tank filled with mineral oil. The GC allows the full containment of the energy deposition of gamma rays from the neutron capture on Gd and the positron annihilation in the NT region. The buffer volume acts as a shield against the radioactivity of the detector surroundings, including that coming from the 390 photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) installed for light collection. The NT, GC and the buffer tank form the inner detector (ID), which is surrounded by the inner veto (IV), a 50 cm thick liquid scintillator volume equipped with 78 PMTs. The ID and IV are in turn surrounded by 1 m of water in the near detector and 15 cm of steel in the far one. Finally, the upper part of the detector is covered by an outer muon veto (OV), consisting of plastic scintillator strips grouped into modules. Figure  2 shows the layout of the Double Chooz detectors. A more detailed description can be found in refs. [1,2] and references therein.",

From muons crossing the ID (selected by means of the deposited energy), it is possible to select those crossing the detector at a distance to the centre smaller than R (defined as radial cut). By this selection, the detector can be approximated as spherical, with an effective surface area of \u03c0R 2 . As mentioned, tracks are reconstructed for those muons crossing the ID and, more specifically, crossing the volumes filled with liquid scintillator (NT and GC), which are contained within the GC cylinder, of 3.4 m diameter and 3.6 m height. With these dimensions, the shortest distance of the GC surface to the detector centre is 1.7 m, and the longest 2.5 m. Therefore, spheres defined having radii between these two values fit better within the GC cylinder. Figure 4 shows the reconstructed muon flux as a function of the defined radial cut, revealing an equivalent behaviour for both detectors. The spatial resolution of the reconstruction algorithm induces a systematic inwards radial shift, leading to overestimated flux values when the radial cut value is small. However, for larger radial values, this shift is compensated, yielding a more reliable value for the muon flux. For the radial cut values corresponding to spheres fitting better within the GC (the above mentioned 1.7 and 2.5 m) the reconstructed flux remains constant, indicating that this is the unbiased value. If the radial cut value is bigger than 2.5 m, the flux is underestimated if no efficiency correction is applied as the corresponding sphere no longer fits within the GC limits. Based on these features, the muon flux has been estimated as the mean value of the reconstructed flux in the radial cut window between 1.7 and 2.5 m. It results in \u03a6 \u00b5 =(3.64 \u00b1 0.04) \u00d7 10 \u22124 cm \u22122 s \u22121 for the near detector and \u03a6 \u00b5 =(7.00 \u00b1 0.05) \u00d7 10 \u22125 cm \u22122 s \u22121 for the far one. The large amount of analyzed data (more than 10 9 selected muons available for both detectors) makes the statistical error negligible. The systematic uncertainties have two contributions. First one, associated with the detection efficiency, is estimated as 0.07% for both detectors. Additionally, the precision on the distance to the centre distribution induces a systematic which has been estimated by varying the radial cut window. This leads to an additional 1.1% systematic for the near detector and 0.7% for the far one. Both contributions lead to overall systematic uncertainty in the muon flux estimation of 1.1% and 0.7% for the near and far detectors respectively.",

Due to the constraints coming from the overburden definition, not all the muons from the 2\u03c0 solid-angle hemisphere are simulated, but only those suitable to traverse the overburden. This excludes muons with high \u03b8 angle which should be removed from the initial muon flux. In addition, the ranges of energies of the simulated muons have been defined by the energy threshold determined by the detector overburdens and should also be taken into account in computing the muon flux at surface. The uncertainties associated with this value for the far detector are bigger since the overburden is less regular than for the near detector. The survival probability is directly related to the overburden geometry and composition. For the far detector the digitization of the profile is precise enough that the obtained value for the survival probability has a negligible error. For the near detector case, due to the lower precision on the digitization, an uncertainty is induced. This has been evaluated by performing simulations shifting the profile by a distance related to the precision of the measurement points provided by the IGN plan. Table 2 summarizes the values obtained on the initial and final fluxes for both detectors taking into account the corresponding uncertainties. The reconstructed fluxes extracted from the experimental data as described in section 3 are also indicated. For both cases, the reconstructed flux from simulations is in agreement with the experimental data within the associated uncertainties. Turning to the angular distributions, figure 6 presents the distribution of simulated muons reaching the detectors versus the \u03b8 and \u03c6 angles. As for the reconstructed tracks from data, more populated directions correspond to those where the overburden is thiner.

Due to the less dense medium the mean free path of mesons is longer, increasing the fraction of mesons decaying before having an interaction. Therefore an increase in the temperature of the atmosphere should result in an increase of the measured muon rate. For this reason, a positive correlation between muon rate and averaged atmospheric temperature is expected, leading to seasonal variations with maxima in summer and minima in winter.

This case, also known as barometric effect, is actually a combination of three effects as detailed in [14]. Pressure changes also induce density changes in the atmosphere. If the pressure increases, the density does too, leading to additional loss of muons as first effect. Moreover the muon survival probability decreases as second effect. As third effect, with a denser atmosphere more mesons are produced and can eventually decay into muons, so muon production through pions and kaons increases. First two effects reduce the number of muons when the pressure increases, while the third one increases this number. As consequence, the barometric effect implies an overall negative correlation between the muon rate and the surface pressure, defined as the barometer coefficient (\u03b2, expressed in %/mbar). However, it has been measured [15,16] that this correlation is more relevant for low energy muons and that \u03b2 decreases exponentially for E thr cos \u03b8 values above 10 GeV, being of the order of \u223c10 \u22122 %/mbar for the E thr cos \u03b8 values corresponding to Double Chooz detectors.

This provides 347 data pairs for the near detector and 897 for the far one. A linear regression between the temperature and rate variations provides the \u03b1 T value, using the total least squares to take into account errors in both variables. The strength of this linear correlation can be characterized by Pearson's correlation coefficient, which takes values from -1 (perfect negative linear relationship) to +1 (perfect positive linear relationship). Figure 10 shows the correlation between \u2206R \u00b5 / R \u00b5 and \u2206T ef f / T ef f for both Double Chooz detectors, together with their corresponding linear fits, from which the values of \u03b1 T are extracted. Table 4 summarizes the values of \u03b1 T and the associated correlation values estimated for near and far detectors. For \u03b1 T , systematics come from the uncertainties of all the parameters used to estimate the effective temperature as described in eq. (5.1) and summarized in table 5. The main contribution comes from the accuracy of the temperature measurement at different atmosphere levels (T (X n )). The comparison of these values with those taken by other apparatus impies an accuracy of \u223c5 %. The combination of this contribution with all the others provides an overall systematic uncertainty of 5.15 %.",
