Events with one electron and one muon are selected, corresponding to the decay of the diboson system as W W \u2192 e \u00b1 \u03bd\u03bc \u2213 \u03bd. To suppress topquark background, events containing jets with a transverse momentum exceeding 35 GeV are not included in the measurement phase space. The fiducial cross-section, six differential distributions and the cross-section as a function of the jet-veto transverse momentum threshold are measured and compared with several theoretical predictions. Constraints on anomalous electroweak gauge boson self-interactions are also presented in the framework of a dimension-six effective field theory.",

The W W production process is also important as it constitutes large irreducible backgrounds in searches for physics beyond the SM and to H \u2192 W W * production. Its large production cross-section combined with the large sample of proton-proton ( pp) collision data delivered by the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), enables this process to be studied differentially with a better statistical precision than was possible in previous measurements.",

This has remedied the mismatch between the total measured and predicted cross-sections, but some discrepancies in the differential distributions persist. The highenergy behaviour of the W W cross-section and the angular distributions of the W W decay products could be affected by new physical phenomena at higher partonic centre-ofmass energies, such as EW doublet or triplet scalars [17,18] or degenerate and non-degenerate top-quark superpartners (stops) in supersymmetry (SUSY) scenarios [19,20]. These specific models can be constrained by their contribution to dimension-six operators in an effective Lagrangian at tree level [17]. At lower partonic centre-of-mass energies, W W production can also be used to provide complementary constraints on compressed EW SUSY scenarios with low stop masses [21].",

Figure 1 shows representative sub-processes. To allow for a proper treatment and inclusion of the interference, which is especially relevant in the tails of kinematic distributions, the resonant production is kept as part of the signal. The fiducial phase space is defined to be orthogonal to the H \u2192 W W measurements by the ATLAS Collaboration [22,23] using a requirement on the dilepton invariant mass. Therefore the Higgs boson contribution included in the signal definition is dominated by off-shell production and interference effects. The production of two W bosons from the decay of top-antitop quark pairs is not considered part of the signal.",

The qq \u2192 W W production cross-section is known to O(\u03b1 2 s ), next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) [11,15]. Recently, also a NNLO prediction matched to a parton shower has become available [15,24,25]. The nonresonant gg \u2192 W W production cross-section is known to O(\u03b1 3 s ), next-to-leading order (NLO) [26], and its interference with the resonant gg \u2192 W W production cross-section is known to O(\u03b1 2 s ). This paper presents a measurement of the fiducial crosssection for W W production at \u221a s = 13 TeV using pp collision data recorded in 2015 and 2016 by the ATLAS experiment, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb \u22121 . The W W \u2192 e \u00b1 \u03bd\u03bc \u2213 \u03bd decay channel is studied (denoted in the following by W W \u2192 e\u03bc). The measurement is performed in a phase space close to the geometric and kinematic acceptance of the experimental analysis. This includes a veto on the presence of jets with transverse momenta ( p T ) above a series of thresholds, with a p T = 35 GeV threshold used as a baseline. Measuring the fiducial cross-section as a function of the jet veto p T threshold provides an indirect measure of the jet p T spectrum in W W events, without removing the jet veto that is necessary for background suppression.",

The Sherpa 2.1.1+OpenLoops framework also allows these contributions to be generated and studied separately. In both cases, the CT10 [37] parton distribution functions (PDF) were used. Powheg-Box was interfaced to Pythia 8.210 [38] for the modelling of parton showers and hadronization as well as underlying-event simulation, using the AZNLO [39] set of tuned parameters ('tune') and the CTEQ6L1 [40] PDF set. Sherpa used its own parton shower, fragmentation and underlying-event model. Alternative signal samples for the quark-induced production were gener-ated using Powheg-Box interfaced to Herwig++ 2.7.1 [41] with the UEEE5 tune [42], and using the Sherpa 2.2.2 generator with its own model for parton showering, hadronization and the underlying event. The Sherpa 2.2.2 prediction was obtained at NLO with up to one additional parton emission and up to three at LO and employs the NNPDF3.0 [43] PDF set. The W W signal predictions were normalized to the NNLO cross-section [11]; the gg \u2192 W W process was normalized to its inclusive NLO cross-section [26].",

For the parton shower, hadronization and underlying event, simulated events were interfaced to Pythia 8.186 for tt and Pythia 6.425 [45] for single-top production, using the A14 tune [46] and the Perugia 2012 [47] tune, respectively. The top-quark mass was set to 172.5 GeV. In the tt sample, the h damp parameter that regulates the highp T emission, against which the tt system recoils, was set to 1.5 times the top-quark mass following studies reported in Ref. [48]. Alternative samples were generated with different settings to assess the uncertainty in modelling top-quark events. To estimate uncertainties in additional QCD radiation in top-quark processes, a pair of samples was produced with the alternative sets of A14 (tt) or Perugia 2012 (W t) parameters for higher and lower radiation, as well as with different renormalization and factorization scales which were both varied either by a factor of 2 or 0.5. For the higher-radiation samples, the value of the h damp parameter was doubled. Two alternative Monte Carlo (MC) programs were used to estimate the impact of the choice of hard-scatter generator and hadronization algorithm in top-quark events; for each of these samples one of the two components was replaced by an alternative choice. The alter-native choices are MadGraph5_aMC@NLO 2.3 [49] for the hard-scatter generator and Herwig 7 [50] (Herwig++ 2.7.1) for the hadronization algorithm in tt (W t) events. In addition, the modelling of the overlap at NLO between W t and tt diagrams [51] was studied. The effect was assessed by generating W t events with different schemes for overlap removal using the Powheg-Box event generator interfaced to Pythia 6.425 for the simulation of parton showering and non-perturbative effects. The top-quark events were normalized using the NNLO+next-to-next-to-leading-logarithm (NNLL) QCD cross-section [52] for tt, and the NLO+NNLL cross-section [53] for W t production.",

The background from triboson production was modelled using the Sherpa+OpenLoops generator with the CT10 PDF set, calculated at NLO for inclusive production and including up to two hard parton emissions at LO. The W Z, Z Z and triboson samples produced with Sherpa were normalized to the cross-section calculated by Sherpa, with hard parton emissions at NLO or LO as discussed, and thus already capturing some of the NNLO effects. The W Z and Z Z backgrounds simulated with Powheg-Box were normalized to their NNLO cross-sections [56][57][58][59][60].",

The systematic uncertainties in N top SR are significantly reduced due to the systematics cancellations compared with the uncertainty bands from Fig. 2. The decrease of MC jet-veto at high leading lepton p T is due to an increase in the typical p T of extra jets which recoil against the leptons, nearing the jet-veto p T threshold, and hence reducing the probability to still pass the jet veto.

The C factor is defined as the ratio of the number of reconstructed W W events after the final selection with electrons or muons in the final state (including electrons or muons from \u03c4 -lepton decays) to the number of W W events generated in the fiducial region where only direct decays of W bosons to electrons and muons are allowed. The C factor takes into account the contribution to the W W signal originating outside of the fiducial phase space. This contribution is estimated from MC simulation to be about 21% of the expected reconstructed signal, about 40% of which originates from \u03c4 -lepton decays. The C factor has a value of 0.613 with an uncertainty of 3%, including experimental and unfolding method sources, as detailed in Sect. 7. The fiducial cross-section as a function of the jet-veto p T threshold is determined using the same method, but modifying the selection requirements to exclude events with jets above a transverse momentum of 30 GeV, 35 GeV, 40 GeV, 45 GeV, 50 GeV, 55 GeV, and 60 GeV, respectively. The T . The number of iterations is optimized to find a balance between too many iterations, causing high statistical uncertainties in the unfolded distributions, and too few iterations, which can bias the measurement towards the MC prediction. The unfolding procedure corrects for migrations between bins in the distributions during the reconstruction of the events, and applies fiducial as well as reconstruction efficiency corrections. The fiducial corrections take into account events that are reconstructed in the signal region, but originate from outside the fiducial region; the reconstruction efficiency corrects for events inside the fiducial region that are not reconstructed in the signal region due to detector inefficiencies. Tests with MC simulation demonstrate that the method is successful in retrieving the true distribution in the fiducial region from the reconstructed distribution in the signal region.",

The impact of statistical uncertainties in the nominal signal simulation is estimated using pseudo-data. The theory uncertainties cover PDF and scale variations of the unfolding inputs. The PDF uncertainty is estimated as the 68% confidence level (CL) envelope of the CT10 [37] prediction.

The qq-initiated production makes up 95% of the total cross-section, while the nonresonant and resonant gg-initiated sub-processes account for 5%. NNLO predictions for the qq \u2192 W W production crosssections are determined using the MATRIX program [101][102][103], including off-shell effects and the non-resonant and resonant gluon-initiated contributions at LO. For improved precision, the MATRIX prediction for qq-initiated production is also complemented with NLO corrections to gluon-induced W W production [104] and with extra NLO EW corrections that also include the photon-induced (\u03b3 \u03b3 \u2192 W W ) contribution [105]. For all these predictions, the NNPDF 3.1 LUXqed PDF set is used [106,107], the renormalization and factorization scales are set to m W W /2, and the scale uncertainties are evaluated according to Ref. [108]. The PDF uncertainty corresponds to the 68% CL variations of the NNPDF set. The MATRIX prediction itself does not include EW radiative effects from leptons in contrast to the MC simulation used to define leptons in the fiducial region, where photons from the parton shower outside a cone of R = 0.1 can be present. The application of NLO EW corrections compensates, at least partially, for this difference. It is observed that the NLO corrections to the gg \u2192 W W sub-process increase the fiducial cross-section by 3%, whereas the NLO EW corrections, applied to the sum of qq-and gg-initiated production, decrease it by 6%. NLO predictions for qq \u2192 W W production, which are matched to a parton shower (qq NLO+PS), are determined using either Powheg-Box interfaced to Pythia 8 or Herwig++, or Sherpa 2.2.2. They are combined with the Sherpa+OpenLoops calculation for the gluon-induced nonresonant and resonant W W production (gg LO+PS). These predictions are described in detail in Sect. 3. The NLO+PS predictions also include photon final-state radiation and thus already part of the EW effects. Therefore no additional EW correction is applied.",

The fiducial cross-section rises by about 30% when accepting events containing jets with a transverse momentum of up to 60 GeV, as compared with 30 GeV. The measurement is compared to NNLO predictions from MATRIX (Fig. 6, left), and to NLO+PS predictions from Powheg-Box+Pythia 8, Powheg-Box+Herwig++ and Sherpa 2.2.2 for qq-initiated states, combined with Sherpa+OpenLoops (LO+PS) for the gg initial states (Fig. 6, right). All three qq NLO+PS predictions are normalized to the NNLO theoretical prediction for the total cross-section, with the gg LO+PS contribution normalized to NLO. With increasing jet-veto p T threshold, the fiducial cross-section rises as it becomes more inclusive.

All of these predictions provide a fair description of the data, except for low values of the p T of the leading lepton as well as low values of invariant mass m e\u03bc and \u03c6 e\u03bc < 1.8.

The most consistent difference is observed at around \u03c6 e\u03bc \u2248 1.5. A similar underprediction of the data, shifted slightly to lower \u03c6 e\u03bc values (around \u2248 0.5-1.0) was seen in both the ATLAS and CMS measurements at 8 TeV [6,8] when compared with the predictions from a variety of MC generators.

The measurement is performed with data recorded by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC in 2015 and 2016, which correspond to an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb \u22121 . The measured fiducial cross-section is \u03c3 fid = (379.1 \u00b1 5.0 (stat) \u00b1 25.4 (syst) \u00b1 8.0 (lumi)) fb, and is found to be consistent with theoretical predictions, including NNLO QCD and NLO EW corrections. The fiducial cross-section is also measured as a function of the transverse momentum threshold for the jet veto. Differential crosssections are measured as a function of kinematic and angular variables of the final-state charged leptons and are compared with several predictions from perturbative QCD calculations. Data and theory show fair agreement for all differential distributions. The distribution of the transverse momentum of the leading lepton is used to investigate anomalous triplegauge-boson coupling parameters. No evidence for anomalous W W Z and W W \u03b3 couplings is found, hence limits on their magnitudes are set. These limits are more restrictive than those derived at \u221a s = 8 TeV.",

The jet energy is calibrated by applying a p T -and \u03b7-dependent correction derived from MC simulation with additional corrections based on data [72]. As part of the jet energy calibration a pile-up correction based on the concept of jet area is applied to the jet candidates [73]. Jets are required to have a pseudorapidity |\u03b7| < 4.5.",
