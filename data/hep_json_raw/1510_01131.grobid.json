The two heaviest sets of particles produced in standard model (SM) processes that could be observed using the data already collected are top quark pairs produced in association with a W or Z boson (ttW and ttZ), which have expected cross sections of \u03c3(ttW) = 203 +20 \u221222 fb and \u03c3(ttZ) = 206 +19 \u221224 fb in the SM in 8 TeV collisions [1]. The dominant production mechanisms for ttW and ttZ in pp collisions are shown in figure 1. The ttZ production cross section provides the most accessible direct measurement of the top quark coupling to the Z boson. Both \u03c3(ttW) and \u03c3(ttZ) would be altered in a variety of new physics models that can be parameterized by dimension-six operators added to the SM Lagrangian.",

The energy of muons is obtained from the curvature of the corresponding track and hits in the muon chambers. The energy of charged hadrons is determined from a combination of their momentum measured in the tracker and the matching ECAL and HCAL energy deposits, corrected for zero-suppression effects and for the response function of the calorimeters to hadronic showers.

Because the Z boson, WZ, and ZZ simulation samples are produced with fewer extra partons from QCD radiation than there are jets in the final selection, their estimated contributions to the signal channels are approximations with large uncertainties. To get a more accurate estimate of these yields, scale factors are derived from events with SF OS leptons consistent with a Z boson decay and no medium b-tagged jets. Using about 5000 data events, of which 97% are expected to come from Z \u2192 events, we correct the predicted yield from the Z boson simulation as a function of the number of jets for events with five or more jets. To validate this technique, we derive a scale factor from four jet events with no medium b tags and apply it to events with at least one medium b tag, and find that it yields good agreement between data and the Z boson simulation. These scale factors range from 1.35 to 1.7, and each has an uncertainty of 30%, based on the level of data-to-simulation agreement in Z boson events with four jets. Additional uncertainties in the \u03b7 distribution of jets in Z boson and tt events, and on the p miss T distribution in Z boson events with extra jets, are assessed due to possible data-to-simulation discrepancies in OS dilepton events with four or more jets (excluding the OS ttZ signal region). Scale factors for simulated WZ and ZZ events with three or more jets are derived from 80 three-lepton data events (70% from WZ) with no medium b-tagged jets and at most one loose b-tagged jet. The scale factors of 1.4 for three-jet events, and 1.6 for events with four or more jets, have 40% and 60% uncertainties, respectively, based on the limited number of 3 data events used to derive the scale factors.",

The matching discriminant is then computed as the product of the corresponding bin values from all the ratio histograms. The permutation with the highest discriminant value is considered to be the best reconstruction of the tt system. To more easily display the full range of values, we take the log of the discriminant value of the best reconstruction to calculate the match score. Events that contain all of the jets and leptons from the tt decay have match scores around zero, while events without all the decay products typically get negative scores. For semileptonic tt decays in events with exactly four jets, all from the tt system, the highest scored permutation is the correct assignment 75% of the time. For events with five or more jets, of which four are from the tt system, the exact correct match is achieved in 40% of cases, as there are five times as many permutations to choose from. Since one or two jets from the tt decay often fail to be reconstructed, we also attempt to match partial ttW and ttZ systems, with one or two jets missing. Output match scores in the OS ttZ, SS ttW, and 3 ttZ channels are shown in figure 3, along with the 68% confidence level (CL) uncertainty in the signal plus background prediction.",

Events with a Z boson plus five jets and six or more jets receive uncorrelated 30% rate uncertainties, based on the extrapolation from Z boson events with four jets and no medium b-tagged jets to those with at least one medium b tag. Diboson WZ and ZZ events with three jets and four or more jets have uncorrelated 40% and 60% uncertainties, respectively, due to the limited number of events in the light flavor sideband used to calibrate jet multiplicity. Diboson events with extra heavy flavor jets receive uncertainties identical to the tt plus heavy flavor simulation. The good data-to-simulation agreement in dileptonic Z boson events with four jets and one or two medium b tags constrains the Z+cc, Z + b, and Z + bb uncertainties to 30% each. Simulated Z boson events have extra shape uncertainties in H miss T and the M T -to-mass ratio of jets, uncorrelated between events with five and six or more jets, and between the different jet flavor subsamples. These account for possible data-to-simulation differences seen in Z boson events with four or more jets (excluding the ttZ signal region). Although these uncertainties are large, the Z boson and diboson backgrounds are well separated from the ttZ signal using the final discriminants, so they have a small effect on the final measurement.",

The effective Lagrangian can be written [44] as an expansion in the inverse of the cutoff energy scale, 1/\u039b: 1) JHEP01 (2016)096where L SM is the SM Lagrangian density of dimension four, L 1 is of dimension five, etc. The Wilson coefficients c i and c j are numerical constants that parameterize the strength of the nonstandard interactions, and O i and O j are operators corresponding to combinations of SM fields. Hermitian conjugate terms are denoted h.c. Good agreement between data and SM expectations suggests that deviations due to NP are small and it is reasonable to work in the first order of c i and c j [45]; we limit ourselves to this domain. It is not possible to construct a dimension-five operator that conserves lepton number [44], so only dimension-six operators are considered in this work. Assuming baryon number conservation, there are 59 independent dimension-six operators [46]. We follow the notation and operator naming scheme introduced in ref. [47].

The cross section depends on a constant term, linear and quadratic terms in C 1,V and C 1,A , and a mixed term. Each of these six terms is scaled by a factor which was evaluated in ref. [54] by calculating the 7 TeV cross section at six points and solving the system of equations. To extrapolate to 8 TeV, we scale \u03c3(ttZ)(C 1,V , C 1,A ) linearly by the ratio of the theoretical ttZ cross sections at 7 and 8 TeV. From this we define the signal strength parameter \u00b5 ttZ in terms of C 1,V and C 1,A , and a profile likelihood ratio test statistic, as described in section 10. We perform a two-dimensional scan of the (C 1,V , C 1,A ) phase space to extract the best fit values, which are found to satisfy the constraint: (11.3) The difference between the profile likelihood and the best fit profile likelihood is plotted as a function of the relative vector and axial components \u2206C 1,",

To study the effects of NP on the ttW and ttZ processes, we use the Feyn-Rules [60] implementation from ref. [47]. This implementation is used with MadGraph 5 [10] to compute cross sections as a function of (v 2 /\u039b 2 ) c j , henceforward simply denoted by c j . Cross sections were computed for the production of tt, a Higgs boson, ttZ, and ttW, sampling 20 points for each c j . For each sampled point, all c k =j were fixed at zero. From this survey, we select five operators as of particular interest because they have a small effect on inclusive Higgs boson and tt production, and a large effect on ttZ, ttW, or both: c uB ,c HQ ,c HQ ,c Hu , andc 3W . An alternative way to display the effect of each c j is shown in figure 10, where sampled values are plotted in the (\u03c3(ttW), \u03c3(ttZ)) plane. From these it is clear thatc uB ,c Hu , andc HQ affect only ttZ, whereasc 3W only affects ttW, andc HQ affects both processes. For each of the five operators, we perform a finer scan of 200 cross section points and use a spline fit to obtain an expression for the cross section in terms of c j , \u03c3(ttZ) SM+NP (c j ). We define the signal strength \u00b5 ttZ (c j ) to be the ratio of the ttZ production cross section to the combined expectations from SM and NP \u03c3(ttZ) SM+NP (c j ), and likewise for ttW. From this we can define a profile likelihood ratio in terms of c j , similarly to what is described in section 10.",
