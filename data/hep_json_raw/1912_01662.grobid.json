The search uses a data set of proton-proton collisions corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 , collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC in 2016, at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The search is carried out in mutually exclusive channels targeting specific decays of the vector bosons: W \u2192 \u03bd, Z \u2192 , and Z \u2192 \u03bd\u03bd, where is an electron or a muon. To fully exploit the topology of the H boson decay, two strategies are followed. In the first one, targeting lower vector boson transverse momentum, the H boson candidate is reconstructed via two resolved jets arising from the two charm quarks from the H boson decay. A second strategy identifies the case where the two charm quark jets from the H boson decay merge to form a single jet, which generally only occurs when the vector boson has higher transverse momentum. Both strategies make use of novel methods for charm jet identification, while jet substructure techniques are also exploited to suppress the background in the merged-jet topology. The two analyses are combined to yield a 95% confidence level observed (expected) upper limit on the cross section \u03c3 (VH) B (H \u2192 cc) of 4.5 (2.4 +1.0 \u22120.7 ) pb, corresponding to 70 (37) times the standard model prediction.",

The mass of this particle is measured to be m H \u223c 125 GeV [7][8][9] and its decays in the \u03b3 \u03b3 , ZZ, WW, and \u03c4\u03c4 modes have been observed [10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20]. All measured properties so far [7,8,8,[21][22][23][24][25][26][27][28][29] indicate that, within the measurement uncertainties, this new particle is consistent with the expectations of the standard model (SM). Nevertheless, there remains much to be learned about the properties of this new particle. One of the highest priorities of the LHC physics program is the measurement of the couplings of the H boson to other SM particles. Recently both ATLAS and CMS Collaborations reported the first direct measurements of -1 -",

In the absence of an observation of Higgs decays to charm quarks, one can place a bound on the charm quark Yukawa coupling. The first direct bound on \u03ba c \u2261 y c /y SM c of 234 at 95% confidence level (CL) has been obtained by recasting the ATLAS and CMS 8 TeV H \u2192 bb searches [41] in a model independent way. Indirect constraints on y c obtained from a global fit to existing H boson data result in an upper bound on \u03ba c \u2261 y c /y SM c of 6.2 [41] at 95% confidence level (CL), assuming the absence of non-SM production mechanisms. A direct measurement of this process is extremely challenging at a hadron collider. The branching fraction of this process according to SM computations, B(H \u2192 cc) = 0.0288 +0.0016 \u22120.0006 [42], is a factor 20 smaller than that of H \u2192 bb, and there is a very large background from SM processes comprised uniquely of jets produced through the strong interaction, referred to as quantum chromodynamics (QCD) multijet events. Results from direct searches for H \u2192 cc at the LHC in the ZH (Z \u2192 , = e or \u00b5) channel were previously reported by the ATLAS Collaboration using a data sample of proton-proton (pp) collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb \u22121 [43]. The observed (expected) exclusion limit on the signal strength \u00b5 (defined as the product of the measured H boson production cross section and the H \u2192 cc branching fraction divided by the same quantity as predicted by the SM) at 95% CL was found to be 110 (150). This paper presents the first direct search for the H \u2192 cc decay carried out by the CMS Collaboration. It uses pp collision data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 , collected with the CMS experiment at the LHC in 2016 at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The search targets H bosons produced in association with a W or Z boson, which we collectively refer to as vector (V) bosons. The presence of a V boson greatly suppresses backgrounds stemming from otherwise overwhelming QCD multijet processes, and its leptonic decays provide a crucial handle to collect the events efficiently. The most significant remaining backgrounds arise from V+jets (processes that account for one or more jets recoiling against a vector boson), tt, and VH(H \u2192 bb) processes. To fully explore the H \u2192 cc decay mode, the analysis is split into two separate searches involving different topologies: the \"resolved-jet\" topology, in which the H boson candidate is reconstructed from two well-separated and individually resolved charm quark jets, and the \"merged-jet\" topology, in which the hadronisation products of the two charm quarks are reconstructed as a single jet. The former focuses on H boson candidates with lower transverse momentum, p T , while the latter performs better for H boson candidates with high p T . In practice, the two topologies can have significant overlap and so, for the final result, the two are made distinct by defining them in reference to whether the V boson in the event has p T (V) below or above a single threshold chosen to maximise the sensitivity to the VH(H \u2192 cc) process.",

To constrain the tt+jets process, on the other hand, each channel relies on its own independent normalisation scale factors. The normalisation scale factors are measured together with the signal strength modifier through a simultaneous fit to data in all control and signal regions for all of the analysis channels. The simulated diboson background is split according to the presence or absence JHEP03(2020)131 of a Z boson decaying to a pair of charm quarks, labelling them as VZ(Z \u2192 cc) if such a Z boson decay is present and VV+other otherwise. Whereas in the signal regions the BDT discriminator is used for the final signal extraction, in the control regions the shape of the CvsB distribution is used in the TT, HF, and CC regions, while that of CvsL is used in the LF region. The reason of this choice lies in the fact that CvsB provides the best discriminant between b and c jets and thus it is used in the control regions where there is an enhanced presence of b jets, while CvsL is more efficient in separating light-flavour quark or gluon jets from c jets and hence it is preferred in the LF control region. Figure 2 shows the distributions of the CvsB discriminant for the subleading CvsL jet for the HF and CC control regions in the 2L (Z(\u00b5\u00b5)) low-p T (V), 2L (Z(ee)) high-p T (V), 1L (W(\u00b5\u03bd)), and 0L channels. The post-fit distributions (for fit details, see section 8) in figure 2 show good agreement between the data and the simulation in these two most significant control regions. Moreover, the employment of the full distribution of the CvsB score provides a good separation between the V+bb and V+cc processes that makes it possible to constrain these two backgrounds.

The possibility for both c quarks to reside in a single large-R jet enhances the signal acceptance, improves the identification of the correct pair of jets to use in reconstructing the H boson, and similarly facilitates the task of taking into account any FSR that may have been emitted by the quarks. A more detailed discussion of the potential advantages of this approach can be found in refs. [90,93].

In VH(H \u2192 cc) signal events, the vector boson and the H boson are typically emitted back-to-back in \u03c6. Therefore, the difference in azimuthal angle between the reconstructed vector boson and H candidate, \u2206\u03c6(V, H), is required to be at least 2.5 rad. To avoid double-counting, small-R jets are removed from the event if they overlap the H candidate with \u2206R(small-R jet, H) < 1.5. To further distinguish the VH signal process from the main backgrounds, a separate BDT is developed for each channel. The goal is to define a discriminant that improves the separation between VH signal and the main backgrounds, while remaining largely independent of the cc tagging discriminant and the H mass. The BDT only makes use of kinematic information from the event, without including intrinsic properties of H such as the flavour content and the mass of the large-R jet, which will be used in a fit to the data for the signal extraction. For the signal process, the VH(H \u2192 bb) sample was used instead of the VH(H \u2192 cc) sample, and only events with even event numbers were used to train the BDT while those with odd event numbers were used for the main analysis. As the BDT is designed to be insensitive to the flavour content of the Higgs candidate, training with the VH(H \u2192 bb) signal sample results in no loss of performance. For the background process, only the main backgrounds, e.g., Z+jets (V+jets and tt+jets) in the case of the 2L (0L and 1L) channel are used. Table 2 summarises the kinematic variables used as input to the BDT for each of the three channels.",

The discrimination power of the BDT depends on the channel. An improved discrimination power is obtained in the 2L and 1L channels compared to the 0L channel. In particular, in the 1L channel, improvement is achieved thanks to the presence of the charged lepton and p miss T , which are then used for the training of the BDT to provide additional handles to suppress the background. For all channels, events with BDT values greater than 0.5 define the signal region. The value of 0.5 was obtained in an optimisation for the 1L  channel, however further tuning of this value for the 0L and 2L channels has a small impact on the sensitivity. Figure 4 (right) shows the distributions of the cc discriminant in the three channels in the signal region for the VH signal and the background processes. Good separation is observed between signal and background. The performance of the cc discriminant degrades with the presence of b quarks, as is the case for tt events, for instance. The signal regions of the merged-jet topology analysis are finally defined requiring the large-R jet to pass one of the three working points of the cc discriminant mentioned above.",

The values of the rate parameters associated with the background normalisations range from \u223c 0.65 to \u223c 2.4 with uncertainties in the range of 10% to 35%. Additional systematic effects are related to the jet energy scale and resolution, which are treated as correlated between the large-and small-R jets. The efficiency to reconstruct and identify electrons and muons is measured in events with Z bosons decaying to electrons and muons via the tag and probe method [95]. The uncertainties on these efficiencies range from 2 to 4%.

The uncertainties associated with this measurement typically range between 1 and 3%. The efficiency of the p miss T trigger is parametrised using a single-muon dataset and the uncertainties are typically below 2%. Theoretical uncertainties related to the cross sections and the p T spectra of the signal and backgrounds are also considered. In the resolved-jet analysis the systematic uncertainties in PDFs, and in the renormalisation and factorisation scales are treated as uncorrelated among the four flavour classes considered in the V+jets processes, as described in section 5. The cross section uncertainties are set to their theoretical predictions, while the systematics associated to the renormalisation and factorisation scales are obtained varying the parameters relative to these scales to 0.5 and 2.0 of their nominal values and estimating the effect. Lastly, the uncertainties in the c quark identification are also considered. The full list of systematic uncertainties is provided in table 3.",
