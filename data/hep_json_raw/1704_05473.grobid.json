It currently comprises data related to several thousand publications including those from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). These are generally the numbers corresponding to the data points either plotted or tabulated in the publications, \"Level 1\" according to the DPHEP [1] classification, and HEPData is therefore complementary to the recent CERN Open Data Portal (http://opendata.cern.ch) which focuses on the release of data from Levels 2 and 3. The traditional focus of HEPData has been on measurements such as production cross sections and so the domain differs from the compilation of particle properties provided by the Particle Data Group (http://www-pdg.lbl.gov). In recent years HEPData has expanded beyond the traditional (unfolded and background-subtracted) measurements to also include data relevant for \"recasting\" LHC searches for physics beyond the Standard Model. The scope of HEPData is also being broadened to include data from particle decays and neutrino experiments, and potentially low-energy data relevant for tuning of the Geant4 detector simulation toolkit.",

To add a new record, all data needed to be first manually transformed into a standard \"input\" text format, consisting of metadata for each table followed by data points in a structured format. The uploaded input file was then parsed by a Perl script to insert the information into the database. For the new HEPData site, we decided to store records as text files rather than in a database, since only the metadata (and not the actual data points) needs to be made searchable. Rather than retaining the old ad hoc \"input\" text format, we defined a new text format (http://github.com/HEPData/hepdata-submission) using YAML (http://yaml.org), which is a superset of JSON that is more human-readable. We investigated the possibility of a new universal input format using ROOT (https://root.cern.ch), but it was not suited to representing all of the diverse data types already present in HepData, particularly the metadata that describe each of the tables. All data from the existing HepData database was then exported to the new YAML format for migration to the new system. A validator (http: //github.com/HEPData/hepdata-validator) was also written to ensure that the YAML/JSON files conform to the defined JSON schema. Migrated YAML files (and future submitted files) are stored on the CERN EOS file system.",

As with the previous HepData site, the main added value of storing the data in a standard format is that the data points can be automatically converted to various formats (see section 5) and visualised. Tables and scatter plots, or heatmap plots if there is more than one independent variable, are rendered with custom JavaScript code making use of the D3.js library (https://d3js.org), with options to switch on and off various elements. Auxiliary files, such as the original ATLAS plot shown in the top-right of figure 1, can be attached or linked to either individual tables or the whole record.

A screenshot of a typical search is shown in figure 2. More specific searches on keywords such as cmenergies, observables, phrases and reactions are also possible. Faceted search is implemented for certain fields; see the left-hand panel in figure 2. All content in HEPData is semantically enriched using Schema.org vocabulary. This means that Google and other search engines know more about the content, and that the content can be automatically retrieved and interpreted by developers. An alternative data-driven search module for HEPData has been developed by Alicia Boya Garc\u00eda for a Master's project at the University of Salamanca and a prototype is available at http://hepdata.rufian.eu; see figure 3. This hepdata-explore package offers the possibility for a user to filter data from multiple publications, producing composite plots, with the ability to download numerical values.  In 2012, a first attempt was made to integrate the old HepData site with the Inspire HEP literature database (http://inspirehep.net) by harvesting the HepData tables and creating new Inspire records for each table. This first attempt was an important step forward, but the integration was never fully completed. The Inspire service is also being rewritten using Invenio v3 and so integration with the new HEPData site should be straightforward. The new HEPData records are now versioned in a way similar to arXiv papers, meaning that mistakes in an original submission can be corrected with a \"version 2\" and the original \"version 1\" is retained and not overwritten. Digital object identifiers (DOIs) are minted separately for each version via DataCite for both whole records and individual tables. Eventually, the DOIs will allow citation of HEPData records to be tracked by Inspire in a similar way to publications.",

An \"Ask a Question\" widget on each record allows any logged-in user to send an email to the submission participants (or to the Admin for migrated records) in order to point out mistakes or ask for clarifications. The Coordinator initiates a new submission by clicking the \"Submit\" button after logging in, then entering either the Inspire (http://inspirehep.net) record number of the corresponding publication (assigned automatically after the paper appears on the arXiv) or a provisional paper title. The Coordinator assigns an Uploader and Reviewer, then an email is sent to the designated Uploader with a link which gives them the privileges to upload a data submission. Once the Uploader thinks their submission is ready for review, they should click the \"Notify Reviewer\" button on the record. An email is then sent to the designated Reviewer with a link which assigns them the appropriate privileges. The Reviewer marks each table as either \"Passed\" review or \"Attention Required\" via a widget displayed next to each table, and messages can be entered to provide feedback to the Uploader. The Uploader can reply to these messages (which are also sent by email) via the widget before uploading a revised submission with corrections. Plots displayed automatically beside each table help to find mistakes in numerical data points. The Reviewer needs to mark each table as having \"Passed\" review before the Coordinator can \"Finalise\" the submission from their Dashboard. The entire submission will then be published and made searchable in HEPData. It will also appear on the hepdata.net homepage under \"Recently Updated Submissions\" and a Tweet will be posted automatically to the @HEPData Twitter account.

There is potential to store low-energy data from nuclear, atomic, and medical physics, relevant for validation of the Geant4 (http://geant4.cern.ch) detector simulation toolkit, but further software development may first be needed to support keywords specific to the low-energy data and to support creation of records where the associated publications do not appear in the Inspire HEP literature database.",

It encodes the full likelihood (including systematic uncertainties) of a measurement using semantic XML and histograms stored in ROOT files. Some preliminary work has been done to extract HEPData tables in the standard YAML format directly from a HistFactory configuration. Furthermore, work has begun on expanding the set of natively supported data types beyond a simple table to allow for richer datasets such as HistFactory configurations or simplified likelihoods [8].

The new site (https://hepdata.net) is now hosted at CERN on the OpenStack infrastructure, but still managed remotely from Durham. The transition from the old site (http://hepdata.cedar.ac.uk) has effectively been completed, with all data records being migrated to the new site. The new submission system has successfully been used for external data submissions from January 2017 onwards.",
