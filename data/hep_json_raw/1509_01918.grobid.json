There are known simulation packages, such as UNIMOD [1], GEANT3 [2], and GEANT4 [3], which successfully describe the physical processes of particles passage through the detector material. Nevertheless, in some cases, the accuracy of the theoretical models and/or the experimental data used in simulation may be not sufficient. Therefore, it is worthwhile to verify the simulation using new experimental data.",

The nuclear interaction length \u03bb int is close to the thickness of the calorimeter sensitive volume L cal = 34.7 cm. Therefore, a significant part of K L mesons undergoes a nuclear interaction in the calorimeter. Charged particles and photons produced in the interaction give an energy deposition in NaI(Tl) crystals near the K L path. Events selected using the criteria described above are divided into two classes, with four and with five or more photons. The latter class is dominated by events, in which the K L mesons either decay or interact inside the detector volume. Figure 3 shows the simulated radial distribution of the disappearance point (due to decay or nuclear interaction) for K L mesons with E = 0.51 GeV. It is seen that the main mechanism of the K L disappearance inside the detector (zones I-IV in Fig. 3) is a nuclear interaction in NaI(Tl).

The boundaries of the intervals listed in the first column of Table 1 are expanded to provide full coverage of possible K L energies, e.g. the value of \u03bb int at \u221a s = 1.06 GeV are used in Eq.(4.1) for the range 1.055-1.065 GeV. The coefficients P i j are determined from the K L energy spectra obtained using MC simulation for different \u221a s. The values of diagonal coefficients P ii are about 0.5 for \u221a s = 1.06 \u2212 1.14 GeV and then increase to about 0.9 at \u221a s > 1.2 GeV. The system of the linear equations (4.1) is solved to determine \u03bb int, j . The systematic uncertainty in \u03bb int due to the K L nonmonochromaticity is estimated to be 1% at \u221a s = 1.02 GeV, then increases reaching a maximum of 3% at \u221a s = 1.08 GeV, and then decreases to 1% at \u221a s = 1.38 GeV. The procedure of \u03bb int measurement described above is tested using simulated e + e \u2212 \u2192 K S K L (\u03b3) events. The found nuclear interaction lengths are consistent with the values \u03bb MC int used in simulation within the statistical uncertainties. The same result is obtained with \u03bb MC int varied by 30%. The corrected values of \u03bb int obtained in data are listed in Table 1. The first error is statistical, the second systematic. The sources of the systematic uncertainty are listed in Table 2. Some of them   are described above. The uncertainty due to imperfect simulation of K L nuclear interaction in the detector material before, after, and between the calorimeter layers is estimated by variation of the cross section used in the MC simulation by 30%. The uncertainty due to the background subtraction is determined by the uncertainties on the numbers of estimated background events in four-and five-photon classes. The systematic errors on the detection efficiencies, \u03b5 5\u03b3 i and \u03b5 4\u03b3 i , associated with K S reconstruction are cancelled in the ratio N 5\u03b3 /(N 5\u03b3 + N 4\u03b3 ). Remaining systematics is due to imperfect simulation of the detector response to K L mesons. The distribution of the normalized energy deposition in the calorimeter E cal / \u221a s for selected data and simulated events at \u221a s = 1.02 GeV is shown Fig. 4. Good agreement between data and simulation spectra is seen. The narrow peak at E cal / \u221a s \u2248 0.5 corresponds to events with undetected K L meson. Since the threshold on the K L energy deposition is low (20 MeV), we do not expect any significant systematic uncertainty due to inaccuracy in the simulation of the detector response. The uncertainty in Table 2 associated with the detection efficiency is determined by simulation statistics. ",
