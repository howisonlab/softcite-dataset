It uses a data sample from proton-proton collisions corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb \u22121 collected by the ATLAS detector at the LHC at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV in 2015 and 2016. This search is guided by a model that includes an extension of the Higgs sector through a scalar triplet, leading to a rich phenomenology that includes doubly charged scalar bosons H \u00b1\u00b1 . Those bosons are produced in pairs in protonproton collisions and decay predominantly into electroweak gauge bosons H \u00b1\u00b1 \u2192 W \u00b1 W \u00b1 . Experimental signatures with several leptons, missing transverse energy and jets are explored. No significant deviations from the Standard Model predictions are found. The parameter space of the benchmark model is excluded at 95% confidence level for H \u00b1\u00b1 bosons with masses between 200 and 220 GeV.",

            "text": "An extension of the scalar sector of the Standard Model (SM) is possible in the context of type II seesaw models [1], originally conceived to explain the smallness of the neutrino masses. In the model investigated in this paper, the scalar sector includes a hypercharge Y = 2 scalar triplet, , in addition to the SM scalar doublet H [2,3]. Electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) is achieved if the neutral components of H and acquire vacuum expectation values, v d and v t respectively. After the EWSB, the mixing between these fields results in seven scalar bosons: H \u00b1\u00b1 , H \u00b1 , A 0 (CP odd), H 0 (CP even), h 0 (CP even). A small mixing between the CPeven scalars allows h 0 to have the expected properties of the SM Higgs boson. In addition, the triplet-neutrino Yukawa term provides non-zero neutrino masses proportional to the vacuum expectation value of the triplet v t . Constraints from electroweak precision measurements lead to an upper bound on v t of around 1 GeV. This range is significantly lower than the electroweak scale and matches the need for small values e-mail: atlas.publications@cern.ch suggested by the natural association of v t with the neutrino masses.",

Extensive searches for leptonic decays H \u00b1\u00b1 \u2192 \u00b1 \u00b1 have been performed at various colliders [6][7][8][9][10][11], where H \u00b1\u00b1 bosons with masses up to about 800 GeV have been excluded. Moreover, searches for H \u00b1\u00b1 \u2192 W \u00b1 W \u00b1 decays have been performed by the CMS Collaboration in the context of single H \u00b1\u00b1 production through vector-boson fusion at large v t (of order of tens of GeV) [12,13] for a model with two Higgs triplets [14]. For that model, a custodial symmetry avoids large contributions to the electroweak precision observables [15]. In contrast, the H \u00b1\u00b1 \u2192 W \u00b1 W \u00b1 decay mode has not been directly searched for so far for small values of v t , where the vector-boson fusion is suppressed.",

The inner tracking detector, covering the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 2.5, consists of silicon pixel and silicon microstrip tracking detectors inside a transitionradiation tracker that covers |\u03b7| < 2.0. It includes, for the \u221a s = 13 TeVrunning period, a newly installed innermost pixel layer, the insertable B-layer [20]. Lead/liquid-argon (LAr) sampling calorimeters provide electromagnetic (EM) energy measurements for |\u03b7| < 2.5 with high granularity and longitudinal segmentation. A hadronic calorimeter consisting of steel and scintillator tiles covers the central pseudorapidity range (|\u03b7| < 1.7). The endcap and forward regions are instrumented with LAr calorimeters for EM and hadronic energy measurements up to |\u03b7| = 4.9. The muon spectrometer surrounds the calorimeters and is based on three large aircore toroid superconducting magnets with eight coils each. It includes a system of precision tracking chambers (|\u03b7| < 2.7) and fast detectors for triggering (|\u03b7| < 2.4). A two-level trigger system is used to select events [21]. The first-level trigger is implemented in hardware and uses a subset of the detector information to reduce the accepted rate to a design maximum of 100 kHz. This is followed by a software-based trigger with a sustained average accepted event rate of about 1 kHz. 1 ATLAS uses a right-handed coordinate system with its origin at the nominal interaction point (IP) in the centre of the detector and the zaxis along the beam pipe. The x-axis points from the IP to the centre of the LHC ring, and the y-axis points upwards. Cylindrical coordinates (r, \u03c6) are used in the transverse plane, \u03c6 being the azimuthal angle around the z-axis. The pseudorapidity is defined in terms of the polar angle \u03b8 as \u03b7 = \u2212 ln tan(\u03b8/2). Angular distance is measured in units of R \u2261 ( \u03b7) 2 + ( \u03c6) 2 .",

The main contribution to the 4 topology is from Z Z production with a total cross-section of 16.9 \u00b1 0.6 pb [45,46], which is suppressed by requiring significant missing transverse momentum in these events.

If only one PDF is shown, the same is used for both the matrix element (ME) and parton shower generators; if two are shown, the first is used for the matrix element calculation and the second for the parton shower.

The processes that contain only reconstructed charged leptons originating from prompt leptonic decays of W and Z bosons are classified as a promptlepton contribution, while processes with at least one of the reconstructed leptons being a misidentified hadron or photon, or a lepton from hadron decays constitute the fake-lepton contribution. The simulated events are not used to evaluate the background originating from charge-misidentified leptons for the 2 ss channel and fake leptons for the 2 ss and 3 channels. These are estimated in general using data-driven methods because they are not well modelled by simulations. This is the case in particular for Z \u2192 + \u2212 , W \u2192 \u03bd and tt processes. The background process V \u03b3 can contribute if electrons originating from the photon conversion are selected. This contribution is found to be small and adequately modelled, so it is estimated using the MC simulation. For the 4 channel, the background from fake leptons is small and the data-driven methods are not applicable due to the low number of events available, so the MC simulation is used to estimate both the prompt-lepton and the fake-lepton contributions.",

The statistical error of this estimate is taken as systematic uncertainty of the charge misidentification rate.

Since at least two leptonic W boson decays are needed to lead to the multi-lepton topologies considered in this analysis, all signal events are expected to feature significant E miss T , while jets are expected from hadronic W boson decays for 2 ss and 3 channels. Moreover, when the mass of the doubly charged Higgs boson is in the range of 200-300 GeV, each H \u00b1\u00b1 is produced with a significant momentum and the two subsequent W bosons are emitted close to each other in the laboratory frame. Consequently, the two same-sign leptons from the decays of the two W bosons tend to be close in the \u03b7-\u03c6 plane. The decay products of the other doubly charged Higgs boson are generally well-separated from the two same-sign leptons.",

The 2 ss category is populated with events containing one prompt lepton from a W boson, or to a lesser extent from a Z boson, and one fake lepton from the hadronic final state produced. The 2 ss events with two same-sign electrons can also originate from Drell-Yan and tt production, where the charge of one of the electrons is misidentified, as explained above. In the 2 ss and 3 channels, most of the expected prompt-lepton contribution is due to the production of W Z associated with jets, with both bosons subsequently decaying into leptons. This process also produces other features of the signal, such as significant E miss T and the absence  of b-jets for most of the production cross-section. For the W Z events, the mass of the same-flavour opposite-sign lepton pair is close to the Z boson mass, while no such resonant distribution is expected for the signal. In the 4 channel, the dominant background originates from tt V and Z Z production. Processes containing top quarks (tt, tt V ) can lead to events with multiple leptons in the final state. A noticeable feature of those processes is the presence of b-jets. Given these properties of the signal and of the expected background, the following discriminating variables, in addition to E miss T , are considered:",

The selection criteria used to define the signal regions are shown in Table 4. The optimisation is performed as a function of the H \u00b1\u00b1 mass for m H \u00b1\u00b1 = 200, 300, 400 and 500 GeV, and seeks the best expected signal significance.

In order to verify the background estimate reliability for the signal region, three further checks were performed: the optimised cuts were applied individually, the cuts were applied successively, or each cut was inverted while the other cuts were applied. The agreement between data and prediction remains adequate for all those cases.",

            "text": "A search for the pair production of doubly charged Higgs scalar bosons with subsequent decays into W bosons is performed in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The data sample was collected by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC and corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb \u22121 . The search for the H \u00b1\u00b1 \u2192 W \u00b1 W \u00b1 decay mode, not considered in previous analyses at colliders, is motivated by a model with an extended scalar sector that includes a triplet in addition to the Standard Model scalar doublet. The analysis proceeds through the selection of multi-lepton events in three channels (a pair of same-sign leptons, three leptons and four leptons) with missing transverse momentum and jets. The signal region is optimised as a function of the H \u00b1\u00b1 mass. The data are found to be in good agreement with the Standard Model predictions for all channels investigated. Combining those channels, the model considered is excluded at 95% confidence level for H \u00b1\u00b1 boson masses between 200 and 220 GeV. of the LHC, as well as the support staff from our institutions without whom ATLAS could not be operated efficiently.

Jets containing b-hadrons are identified (b-tagged) via a multi-variate discriminant combining information from the impact parameters of displaced tracks with topological properties of secondary and tertiary decay vertices reconstructed within the jet [57].
