It represents the first measurement of the running of \u03b1(s) in this energy region. Our results show a more than 5\u03c3 significance of the hadronic contribution to the running of \u03b1(s), which is the strongest direct evidence both in time-and space-like regions achieved in a single measurement. By using the e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 cross section measured by KLOE, the real and imaginary parts of the shift \u03b1(s) have been extracted. From a fit of the real part of \u03b1(s) and assuming the lepton universality the branching ratio B R(\u03c9 \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 ) = (6.6 \u00b1 1.4 stat \u00b1 1.7 syst ) \u2022 10 \u22125 has been determined.",

One of the basic input parameters is the effective QED coupling constant \u03b1, determined from the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron with the impressive accuracy of 0.37 parts per billion [2]. However, physics at non-zero momentum transfer requires an effective electromagnetic coupling \u03b1(s). 1 The shift of the fine-structure constant from the Thomson limit to high energy involves low energy non-perturbative hadronic effects which affect the precision. These effects represent the largest uncertainty (and the main limitation) for the electroweak precision tests as the determination of sin 2 \u03b8 W at the Z pole or the SM prediction of the muon g \u2212 2 [3].",

The effect of the \u03c3 MT RK cut on the two distributions is clearly visible. on M T R K . Assuming the presence of only one unobserved photon and that the tracks belong to particles of the same mass, M T R K is computed from energy and momentum conservation. The \u03c3 MT R K variable is constructed event by event with the error matrix of the fitted tracks at the point of closest approach (PCA) [13]. Cutting the high values of this variable the bad reconstructed tracks are rejected allowing a reduction of the \u03c0\u03c0\u03b3 events contamination (shown in Fig. 2). Residual background is evaluated by fitting the observed M T R K spectrum with a superposition of MC simulation distributions describing signal and \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b3 , \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 and e + e \u2212 \u03b3 events.
