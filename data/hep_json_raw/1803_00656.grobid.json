At the Tevatron, quarkantiquark scattering dominates the top-antitop quark (tt) production cross section, while at the LHC, with its higher center of mass energy and no valence antiquarks, gluon-gluon scattering dominates. The tt signatures are classified according to the decays of the W bosons that come from tt decay. If both W bosons decay hadronically, the channel is called the alljets final state.

It is not predicted by the model and its large value is affects many of the observables in top quark production and decay. The large m t is also responsible for large contributions to quantum loop corrections to electroweak observables. For example, together with the mass of the W boson, m t predicts the mass of the Higgs boson in the SM. This indirect determination can now be compared with the direct measurement of the Higgs boson mass to test the consistency of the SM. In addition the mass of the top quark and the Higgs boson are the two parameters that govern the shape of the Higgs potential at high energy, allowing to answer the fundamental question of the vacuum stability of our universe.

First determined at the Tevatron, m t is now being measured both at the Tevatron and at the LHC with a precision of around 1 GeV. Due to this precision, the top quark has the best-known mass of all the quarks. This precision was achieved largely through innovative analysis techniques including the introduction of the so-called in-situ jet calibration. This method is only applicable to decay channels where at least one of the W bosons from the top quark decays hadronically. In this technique, one calibrates the jet energy corrections by constraining the invariant mass of the two jets from the W boson to the world average measured value of the W boson mass. Doing so significantly reduces the associated systematic uncertainty.",

The maximum likelihood fit is extended to two dimensions to use the hadronically decaying W boson to calibrate the jet energy corrections. In the channel, due to the presence of two undetected neutrinos, the tt kinematics is under constrained. Therefore, it is necessary to make additional kinematic assumptions to be able to reconstruct m t . With these assumptions, the event kinematics can be solved and a weight for a given choice of m t can be determined. One can assign such weights by comparing the calculated missing transverse energy to the measured value for each event for a given neutrino assumption (neutrino weighting technique) or the method can be based on the probability density of observing the measured charged lepton in the rest frame of the top quark (matrix weighting technique). The statistical power of the template method can be lower compared with the other methods because it neither uses the full event information nor gives higher weights to the best-measured events.",

The event probability is built from signal and background probabilities weighted by their relative contributions. The signal probability is constructed from the convolution of the differential cross section with the parton distribution functions and the transfer functions. The background probability is also built using the appropriate matrix element. With this method it is also possible to calibrate the jet energy correction in-situ. Because it uses the full kinematic information, the ME method offers the best statistical sensitivity and was used at the Tevatron experiments, which the tt statistics is less abundant than at the LHC. However, this method is CPU intensive. Both CDF and D0 use this technique in the +jets and channel.

These numbers can be used to reduce the systematic uncertainty due to the uncertainty on the b-tagging efficiency and to simultaneously measure R and the tt production cross section. The current measurement from D0 uses the combined information from tt events in the +jets and channels. D0 has measured R = 0.90 \u00b1 0.04, which is 2.5 \u03c3 from the SM prediction. CDF's (34) latest result in the channel provides R = 0.93 \u00b1 0.04, whereas CMS (35) has measured R = 1.01 \u00b1 0.03; both are consistent with the SM prediction.",

With the approaching increase in the energy and luminosity of the LHC, significantly larger samples of top quarks will become available in a few years, and studies of the properties of top quarks will continue to improve. Whether the top quark will play an important role in any discovery of new physics remains to be determined.

The e + e \u2212 , \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 and e \u00b1 \u00b5 \u2213 channels are fitted simultaneously with a common value of f SM , a tt normalization that is allowed to vary (per channel) and a fixed background normalization. The fitted tt normalizations are in agreement with the theoretical prediction of the production cross section [44]. Negative values of f SM correspond to an anti-correlation of the top and antitop quark spins. A value of f SM = 0 implies that the spins are uncorrelated and values of f SM > 1 indicate a larger strength of the tt spin correlation than predicted by the SM. The extraction of f SM using the fitting procedure has been verified over a wide range of possible values, \u22121 \u2264 f SM \u2264 2, using MC simulation pseudo-experiments with full detector simulation.

Each depends differently on m t . The advantage of this method is that it allows one to extract m t in a well-defined renormalization scheme. However this approach is less precise than direct measurements.D0 determined m t by using the tt cross section measured in the +jets channel with 5.4 fb \u22121 of data; their result was m t = 167.5 +5.4 \u22124.9 GeV (22). CMS used the measured tt cross section with 2.3 fb \u22121 at \u221a s = 7 TeV, yielding m t = 176.7 +3.8 \u22123.4 GeV (23). An alternative method, employed for the first time by CMS in the channel, is called the endpoint method (24). This method relies on the end distribution of the variable m T 2 used as mass estimator that generalizes the usual transverse mass in the case of pair produced particles with two cascade decays each ending in an invisible particle. Here one extracts m t by using a maximum-likelihood fit of the endpoints of three chosen m T 2 constructions, taking the object resolution into account. With this technique, CMS has measured (24): m t = 173.9 \u00b1 0.9(stat) +1.7 \u22122.1 (syst) GeV, using 5.0 fb \u22121 . The precision of this value is already comparable to the standard measurements in the same channel. Finally, one can also measure m t by using different observables, such as the lifetime and decay length of the B-hadrons from the top-quark decay. The lepton p T from the decay of the W -boson from the top quark can also be used as a mass estimator. The advantage of such estimators is that they rely only minimally on calorimeterbased uncertainties, such as the jet energy scale uncertainty. However, these methods may be sensitive to the modeling of the top quark production kinematics or to the calibration of the bottom quaerk decay length or the bottom quark fragmentation model. CDF employed such alternatives in the +jets channel (25), leading to precision of the order of 4%.",

Recent calculations at NLO, including electroweak corrections, predicted A C = 1.23 \u00b1 0.05% at theLHC (\u221a s = 7 TeV for pp collisions)(59). ATLAS and CMS measurements of the charge asymmetry (at \u221a s = 7 utilizing 5 fb \u22121 of data) have not observed any significant deviation from the SM(Figure 4(75,76,77,78,79)). ATLAS and CMS have also performed differential measurements as a function of m tt , rapidity, and transverse momentum, and have not observed deviations from the SM. However, because the data are dominated by tt events produced from gluon fusion, uncertainties on these measurements are still too large to make a definitive statement about the Tevatron results. Measurements at the LHC and the Tevatron are performed similarly. All current published analyses selected tt events in the semileptonic decay channel, by requiring events with exactly one isolated, high-p T lepton; a large amount of missing transverse energy; and several (three or more) high-p T jets. A topological algorithm is used to reconstruct the kinematics of both the top and antitop quarks from the observed decay products. To properly reconstruct the masses of the top quark, the antitop quark, and the intermediary decaying W bosons, this algorithm decides which jets must match to which partons. The momentum along the beam axis is also reconstructed. Reconstructing the top events is of course not perfect. Approximately 50% of events at both the Tevatron and LHC simply lose a parton from tt decay during selection. Furthermore, in events wherein all partons were found in jet selection, the reconstruction al-gorithm matches them to the correct jets with an efficiency of roughly 60-70%. A regularized unfolding procedure is employed in all analyses to correct for the smearing of the top quark kinematics. To first order, the unfolding technique can be though of as matrix inversion from the reconstructed rapidity distribution to the corrected (unfolded) rapidity distribution. The unfolding ME quantifies the bin-by-bin smearing for tt events, which is built from MC simulations. The asymmetry is then measured simply from the unfolded \u2206y distribution. The predicted distribution of \u2206y for backgrounds is subtracted from data before unfolding. When properly employed, the unfolding technique is fairly model independent, as long as kinematic distributions that are correlated to reconstruction efficiency are similar to the MC simulation used to derive the smearing matrix.Currently, published measurements of the charge asymmetry are still statistically limited even when using the full 5 fb \u22121 of 7 TeV data for both the CMS and ATLAS experiments. However, systematic uncertainties are expected to be dominant for measurements of the charge asymmetry using the 20 fb \u22121 data set at 8 TeV, as well as for anticipated higher-luminosity measurements (300 fb \u22121 and 3,000 fb\u22121 ) with the data sets at 14 TeV. Systematic uncertainties taken into account in measurements of the charge asymmetry include those from detector effects (such as jet energy scale/resolution, lepton energy scale/resolution, and pileup), modeling (such as MC generator and hadronization, MC-derived backgrounds, and parton distribution function uncertainties), and measurement techniques (such as unfolding). The leading two systematics in each measurement are either simulation modeling uncertainties or calibration uncertainties for leptons and jets. Without improvements in technique, these uncertainties will not necessarily scale with integrated luminosity. The pseudorapidity of charged leptons in tt event candidates can also be used to probe the charge asymmetry. Although the predicted asymmetry is much smaller (\u223c 0.4%), this technique prevents complications associated with reconstructing and unfolding the top and anti-top quarks in the event. The leptonbased asymmetry is performed similarly to the reconstructed top quark measurements. Both CDF and D0 have measured the single-lepton asymmetry (A l ) in top quark events:",

This analysis was conducted with and same-sign signatures. The final state could originate from ttZ in the +jets channel, whereas Z \u2192 (where = e or \u00b5). In this channel, two sameflavor, opposite-charge electrons or muons are selected with an invariant mass close to the Z mass. The third lepton is required to have a lower (\u00bf 10 GeV)p T than that of the other two (\u00bf 20 GeV). The main background comes from Drell-Yan process with an additional lepton reconstructed from hadronization products and WZ events. The same-sign dilepton analysis searches for ttV events from ttW in the +jets channel. ttV events can also originate from ttZ with a decay chain like in the channel described above. The same-sign final state benefits from little background from SM processes (W Z, ZZ, Z\u03b3, W \u03b3, W W ). The dominant background in this channel comes from nonprompt leptons or misreconstruction effects. Both the ttZ and ttV cross section measurements are currently limited by statistics and are compatible with the SM predictions.",

Assuming V tb = 1and a top-quark mass of 172.5 GeV, the value of \u0393 t at NLO is 1.33 GeV. A recent next-to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO) calculation predicts \u0393 t = 1.32 GeV (37).Of course, new physics can alter the value of \u0393 t from that predicted by the SM.Both CDF and D0 have measured \u0393 F . CDF measures the width directly using the reconstructed top-quark mass for tt events in the +jets channel(38). They determine the energy scale for calorimeter jets using an in situ calibration and an artificial neural network to improve the jet-energy calibration. In addition to the jet-energy scale, the other dominant systematic uncertainties come from the choice of the event generator and from uncertainties in color reconnection. For m t = 172.5 GeV, CDF finds, using 8.7 fb \u22121 of data, 1.10 < \u0393 t < 4.05 GeV at 68% CL.D0 determines \u0393 t using the partial decay width \u0393(t \u2192 W b) and the branching \u2192 W b) as calculated in the SM to obtain \u0393 t . Using 5.4 fb \u22121 of data, D0 obtains \u0393 t = 2.00 +0.47 \u22120.43 GeV. This result is more precise than the direct measurement by CDF, but has more dependence on theoretical assumptions.3.3 W Helicity in Top-Quark DecaysInthe decay t \u2192 W b, because the W bosons are real particles, their polarizations can be left-handed, right-handed or longitudinal. The fraction of decays with a particular polarization are referred to as the helicity fractions and are denoted F L , F R , and F 0 for left-handed, right handed, and longitudinal W polarizations respectively. For unpolarized top-quark production, in the SM, the helicity fractions are approximately 70% longitudinal and 30% left-handed. At LO and in the limit of zero b-quark mass, helicity suppression forces F R to vanish. Higher order corrections modify these predictions slightly. Current NNLO calculations (40) yield F L = 0.311 \u00b1 0.005, F R = 0.0017 \u00b1 0.0001, and F 0 = 0.687 \u00b1 0.005 for m t = 172.8 \u00b1 1.3 GeV. The helicity fractions can be measured through studies of the angular distributions of the top quark decay products in tt events. Th helicity angle, \u03b8 * , is defined as the angle between the W-boson momentum in the top-quark rest frame and the momentum of the down-type fermion from the W decay measured in the rest frame of the W boson.
