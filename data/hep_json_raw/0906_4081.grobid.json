The contributions from \u03c0 + n, \u03c0 0 p and \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 p exclusive channels account for almost 90% of the meson electroproduction cross section in the N * excitation region. These channels combined are sensitive to a major part of excited proton states. Moreover, these exclusive channels are strongly coupled by hadronic interactions of the respective final states. Therefore, nucleon resonance studies in single (1\u03c0) and charged double pion (2\u03c0) exclusive channels are of key importance for the entire N * physics.",

            "text": "pronounced kinematical dependencies can be established from the studies of correlations between shapes of their cross sections in various observables. Employing this strategy the phenomenological meson-baryon model JM06 [4] was developed with primary goal of determining N * electrocouplings from the combined fit of all nine differential cross sections. This model was initially utilized for the analysis of data [3] in the kinematic area of 1.3<W<1.56 GeV and 0.25<Q 2 <0.6GeV 2 . In this kinematic region the JM06 model describes the \u03b3 * p \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 p production amplitude as a superposition of \u03c0 \u2212 \u2206 ++ , \u03c0 + \u2206 0 isobar channels and direct double pion production mechanisms. The production amplitudes for \u03c0\u2206 intermediate states consist of resonant contributions \u03b3N \u2192 N * , \u2206 * \u2192 \u03c0\u2206, and non-resonant terms. All well established resonances with observed \u03c0\u2206 hadronic decays were incorporated into the JM06 model as well as a 3/2 + (1720) candidate state [2]. However, at 1.3<W<1.56 GeV only the contribu-tions from P 11 (1440) and D 13 (1520) states were outside of the experimental data uncertainties. The nonresonant amplitudes were calculated from the well established Born terms and presented in [4,5]. Additional contact terms were implemented in order to account for possible contributions from other mechanisms to \u03c0\u2206 production [4]. The analysis of CLAS data [3] allowed us to establish the contribution from direct charged double pion (2\u03c0) production mechanisms, when the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 p final state is created without the formation of unstable hadrons in the intermediate states. The amplitudes for these processes, have been determined for the first time, are described in [4]. Recently the JM06 model was updated based on the analysis of the CLAS data [2] collected in a wider kinematic area of 1.4<W<1.8 GeV and 0.5<Q 2 <1.5 GeV 2 . The previous analysis of this data within the framework of the JM05 model version [6,7] was limited to four differential cross sections: \u03c0 + p, \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , \u03c0 \u2212 p invariant masses and \u03c0 \u2212 angular distribu- tions. The current analysis incorporates all nine differential cross sections mentioned above. The JM06 model production mechanisms, determined from the data [3] at W<1.56 GeV, were extended by implementing quasi-two-body channels:",

As a typical example, the model description of the nine differential cross sections at W = 1.71 GeV and Q 2 = 0.65 GeV 2 are presented in Fig. 1 together with the contributing mechanisms. Direct 2\u03c0 electroproduction mechanisms, that account for up to 30% of the cross sections at W< 1.56 GeV [4], decreases with W and become negligible at W> 1.65 GeV. The different mechanisms result in qualitatively different shapes of their respective contributions to various observables.

For the first time we observed the sign change in the Q 2 evolution of A 1/2 electrocoupling for P 11 (1440) state. This distinctive feature was predicted by light cone quark models, showing the essential role of light front effects in the structure of P 11 (1440). However, the light cone model expectations [14,15] and the data on A 1/2 electrocouplings of P 11 (1440) become considerably different at Q 2 <1.0 GeV 2 . This discrepancy offers an indication that at distances of the order of the typical hadron size, not only quark core, but also others degrees of freedom as meson-baryon dressing may have substantial contribution to the resonance structure. Extensive studies of meson-baryon dressing contributions to the structure of low lying N * are now in progress [16].",

These data analysis was carried out within the framework of the updated JM model, outlined above. N * hadronic couplings were taken from analyses of experiments with hadronic probes, presented in PDG. As it was shown in [2], with this choice of resonance hadronic couplings we need to account for the contributions from 3/2 + (1720) candidate state. Electrocouplings of D 33 (1700) and P 13 (1720) states obtained from the analysis of the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 p electroproduction data [2] within the framework of the JM model are shown in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5. For comparison the world data on electrocouplings of D 33 (1700) state, available before the CLAS \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 p electroproduction data, are shown by open circles. They were determined from the analysis of single pion electroproduction channels. The branching fraction to the N \u03c0 final states for the D 33 (1700) decays is less than 20%. Therefore, single pion electroproduction channels have not enough sensitivity to the electrocouplings of this state. This is the reason for huge uncertainties of the previous world data shown in Fig. 4. The studies of \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 p electroproduction provided first information on the electrocouplings of D 33 (1700) and P 13 (1720) states with reasonable accuracy. We observed a rapid fall-off of the A 1/2 electrocoupling of P 13 (1720) state with the photon virtuality Q 2 . At Q 2 above 0.9 GeV 2 the absolute values of the helicity non-conserving A 3/2 electrocouplings become larger than the helicity conserving A 1/2 amplitude. Search for the helicity conserving regime, expected at asymptotically high photon virtualities, represents an interesting open question for the future studies of this state at high photon virtualities.",
