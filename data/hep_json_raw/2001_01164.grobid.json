            "text": "The standard model of particle physics is a well-tested theoretical framework, but there are still a number of issues that deserve further experimental and theoretical investigation. For quark physics, such questions include: the nature of quark confinement, the mechanism that connects the quarks and gluons of the standard model theory to the strongly interacting particles; and the weak decays of quarks, which may provide insights into new physics mechanisms responsible for the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the Universe. These issues are addressed by the Beijing Spectrometer III (BESIII) experiment at the Beijing Electron-Positron Collider II (BEPCII) storage ring, which for the past decade has been studying particles produced in electron-positron collisions in the tau-charm energy-threshold region, and has by now accumulated the world's largest datasets that enables searches for nonstandard hadrons, weak decays of the charmed particles, and new physics phenomena beyond the standard model. Here, we review the contributions of BESIII to such studies and discuss future prospects for BESIII and other experiments.",

In the standard model (SM) of particle physics, the well-established theoretical description of the fundamental particles and their mutual interactions, the building blocks are quarks and leptons, and the forces between them are mediated by the exchange of gauge bosons associated with the weak, electromagnetic, and strong interactions [1]. Although the SM has been successfully tested by numerous experiments, many of its detailed predictions remain to be confirmed (for example, the existence of nonstandard hadrons and the quark mixing properties in weak interaction), and substantial theoretical and experimental efforts are currently being devoted to this end.",

[10]. In addition, these experiments discovered a number of nonstandard hadronic states [11][12][13][14][15] with properties that indicate their substructures are more complex than the quark-antiquark mesons and three-quark baryons of the conventional quark model [16,17].",

BESIII data provide stringent constraints on the CKM quark-flavour mixing scheme with precision measurements of the |V cs | and |V cd | CKM matrix elements that modify the strengths of weak interaction c \u2192 s and c \u2192 d quark transitions, and strong-interaction phases in D-meson decays. These strong phases are basic quantities that are essential inputs to other experiments that determine \u03b3, the CP -violating complex phase angle of the V ub CKM matrix element responsible for B-meson decays. The CKM matrix elements are fundamental constants of the SM that have to be measured in experiment.

This simple picture successfully describes almost all of the hadrons that were observed prior to the operation of the BaBar and Belle B-factory experiments. However, other, nonstandard configurations have been proposed since the very inception of the quark model [16,17]. Although these were the subject of a long series of experimental searches [27], the results were inconclusive. However, starting in 2003, Belle and BaBar discovered a number of meson states that decay to final states that contain both a cand ac-quark [9]. Whereas some of these states have properties that fit well the expectations for the conventional cc mesons of the charmonium model [28], others have properties that do not match those of any cc meson and can only be accommodated by nonstandard, multi-quark configurations [11][12][13][14][15]29]. These latter charmonium-like states are collectively referred to as the XYZ mesons to indicate that their underlying structure is still not well understood. During the same time period, the Belle group discovered candidates for nonstandard mesons in the bottom-quark sector [30] and the LHCb group found strong candidates for five-quark (pentaquark) baryons [31].",

Here, we briefly review some highlights of the BESIII program, including: precision measurements of CKM matrix elements; studies of charmed particle decays; discoveries of new XYZ mesons; in-depth investigations of light hadrons; refined measurements of the fundamental properties of baryons; contributions to stringent tests of the SM, such as the anomalous muon magnetic moment (g \u2212 2) \u00b5 , with precision measurements of the cross section for e + e \u2212 annihilation into hadrons; and preci-sion measurements of the production cross-sections and decay properties of hyperons. We present our perspective on the potential future results from BESIII and other experiments, and discuss the opportunities for studies at proposed next-generation facilities.",

The SM prediction for (g \u2212 2) \u00b5 is very sensitive to the effects of hadronic vacuum polarization (HVP) of the virtual photon, which are about 100 times larger than the current experimental uncertainty and, thus, must be determined with high precision. Vacuum polarization also has a critical influence on precision tests of the electroweak theory, which rely on a precise knowledge of \u03b1(s), the running quantum electrodynamics (QED) coupling constant. Because of vacuum polarization, \u03b1 \u22121 (m 2 Z ) = 128.95\u00b1 0.01 [36] is about 6% below its long-distance value of \u03b1 \u22121 (0) = 137.04.

These measurements used initial state radiation (ISR) events in which one of the incoming beam particles radiates a \u03b3-ray with energy E ISR = xE CM /2 before annihilating at a reduced CM energy of E CM = \u221a 1 \u2212 xE CM . The relative uncertainty of the BESIII measurements is 0.9%, which is similar to the precision of the BaBar [43] and KLOE [47] results. The BESIII measured values agree well with the KLOE results for energies below 0.8 GeV, but are systematically higher at higher energies. In contrast, the BESIII results agree with BaBar at higher energies, but are lower at lower energies. The detailed comparisons are shown in Fig. 1. Nevertheless, the contributions of e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 to the (g \u2212 2) \u00b5 HVP calculation from these experiments are overall in agreement within two standard deviations, and the observed \u223c3.5 standard deviation difference between the calculated muon magnetic moment value and the E821 experimental measurement persists.  [42], CMD-2 [45,46], BaBar [43], KLOE [47], and BESIII [44]. The structure near E CM = 0.78 GeV is due to interference between \u03c1 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and \u03c9 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ; the orange band is the result of a fit from Ref.

In the BESIII measurements reported in Ref. [44], the \u03b3-ray had to be detected, which limited the usable data sample to only a small fraction of the produced events. With larger data sets, not only will these measurements have improved statistical precision, but, by including events in which the \u03b3-ray is emitted along or very close to the beam direction and undetected, but with its presence inferred from energy-momentum constraints, cross sections at even lower E CM values will be measured. In addition, BESIII is currently measuring cross sections for other modes, such as e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 [49], 2(\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ), and \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 2\u03c0 0 , that also contribute to the HVP integral, albeit at a lower level [50]. For E CM above 2 GeV, BESIII does not need to use the ISR method and can make higher precision, direct cross-section measurements [51]. These efforts will continue to improve our understanding of the vacuum polarization of the photon and provide essential input to other experimental programs.",

As a result the lightest charmed hadrons, the D 0 , D + , and D + s mesons, and the \u039b + c baryon, decay via weak interactions. The rates and dynamics of these decays are sensitive to the strong interactions between the parent charm and light quarks and those between the final-state light quarks. The strengths of the weak decays are proportional to the Fermi constant G F multiplied by the V cd and V cs CKM matrix elements. In principle, the strong interactions between quarks can be computed by quantum chromodynamics (QCD), but the calculations are extremely difficult.

(1), the expected relative decay widths for the \u03c4 + \u03bd, \u00b5 + \u03bd, and e + \u03bd modes are 2.67 : 1 : 2.35 \u00d7 10 \u22125 for D + and 9.75 : 1 : 2.35 \u00d7 10 \u22125 for D + s ; the SM D + q \u2192 e + \u03bd decay widths are highly suppressed by helicity conservation, and 2 \u223c 3 orders of magnitude below the sensitivity of BESIII. Although the SM D + q \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03bd decay widths are larger than those for D + q \u2192 \u00b5 + \u03bd, the presence of additional final-state neutrinos from the \u03c4 decay voids the kinematic constraint (the inference of the four-momentum of a single missing neutrino from measurements of all the accompanying particles in the event) that is available for \u00b5 + \u03bd and this results in more background. Nevertheless, D + s \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03bd decay is currently being studied at BESIII with an expected result that will have a precision comparable to that achieved for D + s \u2192 \u00b5 + \u03bd. This result should improve the accuracy of the |V cs |f D + s measurement, and can also be used to test LFU.",

The contribution to the final uncertainty from uncertainties of the strong phases' measured values is \u2248 \u00b12 \u2022 [80]. The current BESIII \u03c8(3770) data set is three and a half times larger than that of CLEO-c and, when fully analyzed, is expected to contribute an uncertainty on \u03b3 that is of order 1 \u2022 [81]. This precision should be adequate for the LHCb Run-2 measurement that has an expected sensitivity of 4 \u2022 and the Belle II measurement that will ultimately have an expected precision of 1.5 The BESIII \u039b c measurements were carried out at E CM = 4.60 GeV, the maximum BEPCII energy, where \u03c3(e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u039b + c\u039b \u2212 c ) = 0.24 \u00b1 0.02 nb [87]. The Belle group reported that this cross-section has a 0.44 \u00b1 0.18 nb peak at E CM = 4.64 \u223c 4.66 GeV [88], which is likely a \u039b + c\u039b \u2212 c decay mode of the Y (4660), a charmonium-like \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c8(3686) resonance found by Belle [89] with mass 4643 \u00b1 9 MeV/c 2 [54]. A BEPCII upgrade that is currently underway will increase its maximum energy to 4.9 GeV that will easily cover the Y (4660) peak region, and future BESIII \u039b c measurements will be done at an energy corresponding to the peak cross-section value with twice the event rate.",

A fit to this signal with a Breit-Wigner function found its mass and width to be M = (3899.0 \u00b1 6.1) MeV/c 2 and \u0393 = (46 \u00b1 22) MeV, with a statistical significance greater than 8 standard deviations. The state was named Z c (3900) following the tradition that uses Z to designate a charged quarkonium-like state and a subscript c to indicate it contains charm quarks. The Z c (3900) was the first charged charmoniumlike state to be confirmed by other experiments [91,92] and is a strong candidate for a four-quark meson (Z + c = ccud; Z \u2212 c = ccd\u016b), where the cc pair is needed to account for its decay into a J/\u03c8 charmonium state and the u and d quarks are needed to account for its non-zero electrical charge. Subsequently, with 5964 \u00b1 83 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8 events collected at E CM = 4.26 and 4.23 GeV (where the e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8 cross-section was found to be larger), a full amplitude analysis of the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8 system was performed and the spin-parity of the Z c (3900) was determined to be J P = 1 + , and its pole mass and width to be (3881 \u00b1 53) MeV/c 2 and (52 \u00b1 36) MeV, respectively [96]. The shift in mass and increase in the uncertainties reflect the effects of interference between the Z c (3900) and other amplitudes that were not considered in the initial analysis. The Z c (3900) mass is 5 MeV/c 2 above the energy threshold for the production of DD * .",

Another possibility is that they are QCD tetraquark states comprising coloured diquarks and diantiquarks tightly bound by the exchange of coloured gluons [105,106] (The quark and gluon configurations of different kind of hadrons are depicted in Fig. 4). Many of the models that were proposed for the Z c (3900) predict the existence of a similar state near the D * D * threshold. Although there are no strong indications of a state near the D * D * mass threshold in BESIII's e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8 or \u03c0DD * data samples, distinct signals for the predicted state, the Z c (4020), were discovered in the e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 h c and \u03c0D * D * channels.",

These features are similar to those expected for kinematic effects that can produce peaks just above thresholds that look like resonances, but have nothing to do with bona fide mesons [108][109][110]. This possibility was studied for the specific case of the Z c (3900) in Ref. [111], which concluded that the characteristics of the narrow Z c (3900) \u2192 DD * signal [97] establishes the presence of a genuine meson-like pole in the DD * S-matrix.

BESIII found three scalar mesons in this mass range in the radiative decay processes J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3\u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 [138], \u03b3K 0 S K 0 S [139], and \u03b3\u03b7\u03b7, where \u03b7 stands for the eta meson [140]: the f 0 (1370), f 0 (1500), and f 0 (1710). Two conventional qq scalar mesons are needed to account for the SU (3) octet and singlet members of the 1 3 P 0 meson nonet, leaving one of them as a candidate for a scalar glueball. One interpretation is that these three mesons mix and, thus, are the three orthogonal mixtures of nn = (u\u016b + dd)/ \u221a 2, ss, and G, that are the two SU (3) qq states and a glueball. Of the three candidates, the f 0 (1710) has the highest production rate; the branching fraction for J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3f 0 (1710) is nearly ten times higher than those for f 0 (1370) and f 0 (1500), and compatible with an LQCD calculated value for a glueball [141]. This suggests that the f 0 (1710) has the largest gluon component. Better measurements of the couplings of these states to \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , KK, \u03b7\u03b7, and \u03b7\u03b7 will supply additional insight into the relative nn, ss, and G content of these states.",

This peak was subsequently confirmed and its spin-parity was measured to be 0 \u2212+ by BESIII with 225 million J/\u03c8 events [145]. BESII also observed an \u03b7 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 invariant mass peak in J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decays, the X(1835) [146], that was suggested as being due to an \u03b7 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decay mode of the same state as that seen in pp [147]. Subsequent BESIII studies of the X(1835) \u2192 \u03b7 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 line shape with a 1.3 billion J/\u03c8 event sample revealed an anomalous structure in its line shape, that is centered at the pp threshold (see Fig. 5), which could be equally well described as the interference with a new narrow resonance that has a mass nearly equal to 2m p or a wide resonance with an anomalously strong coupling to the pp final state [148]. States in this mass region were also reported in J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c9\u03b7\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 [149] and \u03b33(\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) [150], and these also have line shape distortions near the pp mass threshold. However, no near-threshold pp structures are observed in J/\u03c8 decays to \u03c9pp [151] or \u03c6pp [152].",

            "text": "The behaviour of the time-like FFs near the BB mass threshold is particularly interesting. In e + e \u2212 \u2192 BB, the baryon pair is produced in a short-distance interaction mediated by a hard, q 2 \u2265 4m 2 B , virtual photon. However, the final state B andB are nearly at rest relative to each other in a non-relativistic, long-distance system. In the case where B andB are electrically charged, their final state interactions are modified by their mutual Coulomb force. For a point-like charged particle, this Coulomb interaction produces an abrupt jump in the production cross-section right at threshold of \u2206\u03c3 = \u03c0 2 \u03b1 3 /2m 2 B ; for m B = m p , \u2206\u03c3 = 0.85 nb [192,193]. Amazingly, BaBar [194] and CMD-3 [195] measurements of e + e \u2212 \u2192 pp have seen an abrupt jump in the e + e \u2212 \u2192 pp cross-section at the E CM = 2m p threshold that is consistent with the 0.85 nb expectation for a point-like charged particle. BESIII measurements of \u03c3(e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u039b + c\u039b \u2212 c ), shown in Fig. 6, have a \u2206\u03c3 = 0.236 \u00b1 0.047 nb threshold jump [87] that is larger, although marginally consistent with the \u2206\u03c3 = 0.14 nb expectation for an m B = m \u039b + c point-like charged particle. In the case of neutral particles, there is no Coulomb interaction and no mechanism for an abrupt jump at the threshold; the cross-section is expected to grow as the available phase space, which is proportional to \u03b2 f , the relative velocity of the two final-state particles. However, in another big surprise, e + e \u2212 \u2192 nn measurements did not confirm a \u03c3 \u221d \u03b2 n behaviour, instead they also showed an abrupt threshold jump [196,197] that is consistent (within large uncertainties) with the 0.85 nb jump seen for e + e \u2212 \u2192 pp.",

In 2017, BESIII reported measurements of e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u039b\u039b for energies ranging from E CM = 2.2324 GeV (1 MeV above the 2m \u039b threshold with \u03b2 \u039b \u2248 0.03) to E CM = 3.080 GeV [169]. The measured cross-section is maximum right at the \u039b\u039b threshold and falls off at higher energies contrary to theoretical expectations (see Fig. 6). The cross-section value at threshold is 0.305 \u00b1 0.058 nb, about one half the size of the 0.60 nb jump calculated for a (hypothetical) charged point-like baryon with mass m B = m \u039b . One theoretical analysis concluded that such a threshold jump in the e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u039b\u039b cross-section is a strong indication of the presence of a very narrow, 3 S 1 \u039b\u039b resonance with a mass close to 2m \u039b [200].",

Measurement of absolute \u039b + c decay branching fractionsAlthough the \u039b + c baryon was discovered forty years ago[82], its decay properties are still poorly understood. The first model-independent measurement of a \u039b + c decay branching fraction was a 2014 Belle result[83] B(\u039b + c \u2192 pK \u2212 \u03c0 + ) = (6.84 \u00b1 0.36)%. In 2014, BEPCII operated at E CM = 4.60 GeV, which is 27 MeV above threshold for e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u039b + c\u039b \u2212 c production. At this energy, when a \u039b \u2213 c is reconstructed, the accompanying \u039b \u00b1 c is tagged. With a sample of about fourteen thousand tagged \u039b + c\u039b \u2212c events, BESIII reported the first model-independent branching fraction measurements for the semi-leptonic modes \u039b + c \u2192 \u039be + \u03bd[84] and \u039b\u00b5 + \u03bd[85], and for twelve different hadronic \u039b c decay modes, including B(\u039b + c \u2192 pK \u2212 \u03c0 + ) = (5.84 \u00b1 0.35)%[86], which is two standard deviations below the Belle value.",

            "text": "The BESIII experiment [4] recorded its first collisions in July 2008. The detector, shown in Fig. 7, is a general-purpose spectrometer based on a 1 Tesla superconducting (SC) solenoid magnet with a geometrical acceptance that covers 93% of 4\u03c0 steradians. It consists of a layered arrangement of nested instruments, including: a small cell helium-based multi-layered drift chamber (MDC) that provides momentum measurements of charged particles; a cylinder of plastic scintillators that are used to identify charged particles based on their time-of-flight (ToF); an electromagnetic calorimeter that is a mosaic array of CsI(Tl) crystals that are used to detect and measure the energies of \u03b3-rays and provide trigger signals; a surrounding array of Resistive Plate Chambers (RPC) to detect and identify muons. The MDC provides 0.5% momentum resolution for 1 GeV/c charged particle tracks and energy-loss (dE/dx) measurements with a resolution of 6%. The electromagnetic calorimeter energy resolution for 1 GeV \u03b3 rays is 2.5% in the polar angle region | cos \u03b8| < 0.83 (barrel) and 5% for 0.83 \u2264 | cos \u03b8| \u2264 0.93 (endcaps). The TOF system time resolution is 68 ps in the barrel region and 110 ps in the endcaps. In 2015, the endcap TOF scintillators were replaced with a system of multi-layer RPCs that improved the time resolution to 60 ps [204].",
