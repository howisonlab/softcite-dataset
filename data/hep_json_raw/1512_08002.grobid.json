The signature includes a high transverse momentum (p T ) jet associated with initial-state radiation, one or two low-p T leptons, and significant missing transverse energy. The event yields observed in data are consistent with the expected background contributions from standard model processes. Limits are set on the cross section for top squark pair production as a function of the t and LSP masses. Assuming a 100% branching fraction for the four-body decay mode, top-squark masses below 316 GeV are excluded for m = 25 GeV at 95% CL. The dilepton data are also interpreted under the assumption of charginoneutralino production, with subsequent decays to sleptons or sneutrinos. Assuming a difference between the common \u03c7 + 1 / \u03c7 0 2 mass and the LSP mass of 20 GeV and a \u03c4 -enriched decay scenario, masses in the range m( \u03c7 +",

In this case, the events would escape classical search strategies because of the low transverse momenta (p T ) of the decay products of the NLSP. Signal events can still be distinguished from SM processes if a high-p T jet from initial-state radiation (ISR) leads to a boost of the sparticle pair system and enhances the amount of E miss T , while the other decay products typically remain soft. In the signal scenarios studied in this paper, SUSY particles can decay leptonically, and the presence of low-p T leptons can be used to discriminate further against otherwise dominant SM backgrounds, such as multijet production and Z + jets events with invisible Z boson decays. SUSY models with light top squarks ( t) are well motivated as they control the dominant correction to the Higgs boson mass and thereby preserve \"naturalness\" [6,7,[9][10][11][12][13][14].

            "text": "Final states with a hard ISR jet, high E miss T , and one or more charged leptons can also occur in the production of charginoneutralino pairs in compressed SUSY models [22][23][24]. A model of pair-production of the lightest chargino ( \u03c7 + 1 ) with the secondlightest neutralino ( \u03c7 0 2 ) is shown in Fig. 1 (right). Decay chains could proceed via intermediate sleptons or sneutrinos and give rise to final states with one or three charged leptons. In this model, \u03c7 + 1 and \u03c7 0 2 are assumed to be almost degenerate and are assigned a common mass m( \u03c7 ). In general, the same signature can arise from the production of heavy particles whose decay chains contain undetected, slightly lighter particles plus leptons. Previous LHC results for the model of electroweak production described above and mass splittings below m(Z) can be found in Refs. [25][26][27][28][29], where the last two references also report an alternative approach based on the vector-boson fusion topology. In this paper we describe a search for pair production of top squarks with subsequent four-body decays via virtual top quarks and W bosons in events with a high-p T jet, E miss T , and one or two soft leptons, corresponding to signal events with a leptonic decay of at least one of the virtual W bosons. The single-lepton topology offers the second-highest branching fraction after the purely hadronic mode. In this channel we consider only muons, which can be efficiently reconstructed and identified with transverse momenta as low as 5 GeV. For the dilepton topology we require a second lepton (electron or muon) of opposite charge. The single and double electron final states are not used because they have reduced sensitivity compared to the muon channels due to the higher p T thresholds required for electrons. In addition, selected events are required to have an energetic jet compatible with the ISR signature, at most one additional jet of moderate to high p T , no hard leptons, and a significant amount of E miss T . The dominant SM backgrounds to this search are pair production of top quarks, W boson or Z/\u03b3 * production in association with jets, and diboson (VV) production. Their contributions to the signal region (SR) are estimated by correcting the predictions from simulation using the event yields observed in several control regions (CRs) in data. Data are also used to validate this procedure and to derive systematic uncertainties.",

Muons are measured in gas-ionization chambers embedded in the steel fluxreturn yoke surrounding the solenoid.

The PF candidates are clustered into jets by using the anti-k T algorithm [33] with a distance parameter of 0.5. Jets are required to have p T > 30 GeV and |\u03b7| < 4.5, and to pass loose quality criteria [34] based on the energy fractions associated with electromagnetically or hadronically interacting charged or neutral particles. The negative vector sum of the transverse momenta of the PF candidates defines the value of E miss T and the corresponding direction. Jet energies and E miss T are corrected for shifts in the energy scale, contributions from additional, simultaneous proton-proton collisions (pileup), and residual differences between data and simulation [35,36]. Jets originating from b quarks are identified (\"tagged\") using the combined secondary vertex algorithm [37,38] at a working point corresponding to an efficiency of about 70% and a misidentification probability for light-quark jets of about 1%. Hadronic decays of \u03c4 leptons are identified using the hadrons-plus-strips algorithm [39].",

In the single-muon search, the lepton acceptance is restricted to |\u03b7| < 2.1, while in the dilepton search, this limit is tightened to 1.5 for both electrons and muons. Standard loose identification requirements [40,41] are applied to reduce the background from nonprompt (NPR) leptons produced in semileptonic hadron decays and from jets showing a lepton signature. Further background reduction is achieved by requiring the leptons to be isolated. The absolute isolation I abs is computed by summing the transverse momenta of PF candidates, except that of the lepton, in a cone of size R < 0.3 around the lepton direction, where R \u2261 ( \u03c6) 2 + ( \u03b7) 2 and \u03c6 is the azimuthal angle measured in radians. The energy in the isolation cone is corrected for the effects of pileup. The relative isolation I rel is obtained by dividing I abs by the p T of the lepton. The details of the isolation requirements differ between the single-lepton and dilepton topologies due to differences in the dominant backgrounds and the purities.

In this control sample, Z + jets events with Z boson decays to muon pairs are used.

In this topology, less background is expected, and thus the selection requirements on E miss T and the p T of the ISR jet candidate are set to be above 200 and 150 GeV, respectively, just above the trigger thresholds. To increase sensitivity, we select events in two signal regions defined by the p T of the leading lepton: 5-15 and 15-25 GeV. The second lepton is required to have p T < 15 GeV. We require exactly two identified leptons of opposite sign, with at least one of them a muon. Finally, events with an invariant mass of the dilepton pair m( ) < 5 GeV are rejected to remove a region that is difficult to simulate and to avoid any potential J/\u03c8 background. Because the relative fraction of reconstructed leptons not arising from the decay of a W or Z boson (\"nonprompt\" leptons) is higher compared to the single-lepton channel, the isolation and identification criteria on the leptons are stricter. On top of the muon identification used for the single-lepton topology, stricter requirements on the number of tracker hits, the quality of the track fit, and the match After this selection, one of the main backgrounds is Z/\u03b3 * production of \u03c4 pairs, with both \u03c4 leptons decaying leptonically. Under the assumption that the direction of the reconstructed lepton is parallel to the \u03c4 direction, which is true to good approximation, the invariant mass of the \u03c4 pair, m \u03c4 \u03c4 , can be reconstructed by setting its transverse momentum equal to the hadronic recoil (the missing transverse momentum without the leptons).

Apart from the fact that we require high E miss T and two leptons, we also select E miss T /H T > 2/3 to reject any residual multijet events. To evaluate the efficacy of this selection, a test was performed by inverting this requirement to have a region that should have significant multijet background if there were any. For this region, data yields were compared with the simulation results of all considered background categories (which do not include multijet events) and were found to be in agreement. Further tests were performed by using the electron-electron channel and by relaxing the upper limits on d xy and d z to 0.05 cm, which showed no indication for a contamination by multijet events.

By using the t pair production cross section calculated at next-to-leading order (NLO) + next-toleading logarithm (NLL) precision [69][70][71][72][73], the cross section limits can be converted into excluded regions in the t-\u03c7 0 1 mass plane. Uncertainties in these cross sections are determined as detailed in Ref. [74]. At m = 25 GeV, the dilepton search excludes t masses below 316 GeV. Here and in the following all quoted values for mass limits conservatively refer to the \u22121\u03c3 variation of the predicted cross section. The single-muon search shows a smaller reach in m( t) (\u2248 250 GeV) but has a higher sensitivity at the lowest considered mass splitting of 10 GeV, where values up to \u2248 210 GeV are excluded. In the intermediate m region (\u2248 20-70 GeV), these results considerably extend existing limits [19][20][21]. They are complementary to the results of searches in the monojet topology [18,19,21].",
