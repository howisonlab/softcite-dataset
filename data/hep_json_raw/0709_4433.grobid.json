The analysed H1+ZEUS data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 0.97 fb \u22121 , and composes of the complete high energy data from the HERA programme. A total of 87 events are observed in the data, compared to a Standard Model (SM) prediction of 92.7 \u00b1 11.2. At large hadronic transverse momentum P X T > 25 GeV in the e + p data, luminosity 0.58 fb \u22121 , 23 data events are observed compared to a SM prediction of 14.6 \u00b1 1.9. Production cross section measurements of events containing isolated leptons and missing transverse momentum and single W production, as well as W polarisation fractions performed by the H1 Collaboration are also presented. The H1 isolated lepton events are also examined in the context of a search for single top production.",

The event should also contain a large transverse momentum imbalance, P miss T > 12 GeV. Further cuts are then applied, which are designed to reduce SM background, whilst preserving a high level of signal purity. Event quantities sensitive to the presence of high energy undetected particles in the event are employed such as the azimuthal balance of the event, the difference in azimuthal angle between the lepton and the hadronic system and the longitudinal momentum imbalance. To ensure that the two lepton channels are exclusive and may therefore be combined, electron events must contain no isolated muons.",

Nevertheless, in order to coherently combine the results from the two experiments, a common phase space has been established. The common selection is based on the H1 event selection [2,5], but over a more restricted lepton polar angle range of 15 \u2022 < \u03b8 l < 120 \u2022 , as employed in the ZEUS analysis [6].
