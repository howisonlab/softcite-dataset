No significant deviation from the Standard Model prediction is observed and upper limits on the production cross sections of WZ resonances from an extended gauge model W and from a simplified model of heavy vector triplets are derived. A corresponding observed (expected) lower mass limit of 1.52 (1.49) TeV is derived for the W at the 95% confidence level.",

Despite the compatibility between the properties of the newly discovered particle at the LHC [1][2][3][4] with those expected for the Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson, the naturalness problem associated with a light Higgs boson suggests that the SM is likely to be an effective theory valid only at low energies. Extensions of the SM, such as Grand Unified Theories [5], Little Higgs models [6], Technicolor [7][8][9][10], more generic Composite Higgs models [11,12], or models of extra dimensions [13][14][15], predict diboson resonances at high masses.",

Four possible leptonic decay channels (e\u03bdee, e\u03bd\u03bc\u03bc, \u03bc\u03bdee and \u03bc\u03bd\u03bc\u03bc) are considered. To interpret the results, the extended gauge model (EGM) [16] with a spin-1 W boson is used as a benchmark signal hypothesis. In this model, the couplings of the EGM W boson to the SM particles are identical to those of the W boson, except for its coupling to WZ, which is suppressed with respect to the SM WWZ triple gauge coupling by a factor of (m W /m W ) 2 and entails a linear relationship between the resonance width and mass. The branching ratio BR(W \u2192 WZ) varies between 1% and 2% for a W mass range 200-2000 GeV. In other scenarios, such as for leptophobic W bosons [17][18][19], the decay to a pair of gauge bosons can be a dominant channel. A narrow W resonance is predicted in the EGM, with an intrinsic decay width that is negligible with respect E-mail address: atlas.publications@cern.ch.",

Under these assumptions, the final results presented here can be reinterpreted in terms of any narrow spin-1 resonance for a given signal efficiency and acceptance. A phenomenological Lagrangian for heavy vector triplets (HVT) [20] has recently been introduced, where the couplings of the new fields to fermions and gauge bosons are defined in terms of parameters. By scanning these parameters the generic Lagrangian describes a large class of models. The triplet field, which mixes with the SM gauge bosons, couples to the fermionic current through the combination of parameters g 2 c F /g V and to the Higgs and vector bosons through g V c H , where g is the SU(2) L gauge coupling, the parameter g V represents the coupling strength to vector bosons, and c F and c H allow to modify the couplings and are expected to be close to unity in most specific models. Two benchmark models, provided in Ref. [20], are used here as well. In Model A, weakly coupled vector resonances arise from an extension of the SM gauge group [21]. In Model B, the heavy vector triplet is produced in a strongly coupled scenario, for example in a Composite Higgs model [22]. In Model A, the branching fractions to fermions and gauge bosons are comparable, whereas for Model B, fermionic couplings are suppressed.",

This constraint results in a quadratic equation with two solutions for p \u03bd z . If the solutions are real the one with the smaller absolute value is kept. If the solutions are complex only the real part is kept. In general, about 30% of the events are found to have complex solutions, mainly due to the E miss T resolution at the reconstruction level. The invariant mass of the WZ \u2192 \u03bd system is reconstructed from the four-vectors of the candidate W and Z bosons and is used as the discriminating variable for the signal.  [47]. If two possibilities exist, the pair that has m closest to the Z boson pole mass is chosen to form the Z candidate. To suppress the Z + jets background where one jet is reconstructed as an isolated electron, the electrons used in the reconstruction of the W bosons are required to satisfy tighter identification criteria (tight) than those required for the leptons used in the reconstruction of Z boson decays (medium).

A \"fake factor\", defined as the number of events in which a jet satisfies the nominal lepton selection criteria divided by the number of events in which a jet satisfies the lepton-like jet criteria, is computed.
