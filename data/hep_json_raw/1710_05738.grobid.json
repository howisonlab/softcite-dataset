The J/\u03c8 decaying to K S K L proceeds via the first two processes, thereby providing valuable information to understand the nature of J/\u03c8 decays. The available measurements of its branching fraction, B(J/\u03c8 \u2192 K S K L ), based on 57.7 million J/\u03c8 events collected at BESII [1] and 24.5 million \u03c8(3686) events at CLEO [2], are given by (1.82\u00b10.04\u00b10.13)\u00d710 \u22124 and (2.62 \u00b1 0.15 \u00b1 0.14) \u00d7 10 \u22124 respectively. Due to the discrepancy between these two measurements, the world average value in the particle data group (PDG) [3] has quoted a relative precision of 19%, which limits the precise understanding of J/\u03c8 decay mechanisms.",

However, according to the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) [4] paradox, the quantum state of a two-particle system can not always be decomposed into the joint state of the two particles. Thus the space-like separated coherent quantum system may also yield a sizable decay branching fraction of J/\u03c8 \u2192 K S K S at the 10 \u22128 level [5]. In this way, the K S K S system can be used to test the EPR paradox versus quantum theory. There also might be a small possibility to have a K S K S final state due to CP violation. In the K 0K 0 oscillation model [6], the CP violating branching fraction of J/\u03c8 \u2192 K S K S is calculated to be (1.94 \u00b1 0.20) \u00d7 10 \u22129 . The MARKIII experiment searched for the decay J/\u03c8 \u2192 K S K S with 2.7 million events, and the upper limit was determined to be B(J/\u03c8 \u2192 K S K S ) < 5.2 \u00d7 10 \u22126 at the 90% confidence level (C.L.) [7]. Based on 57.7 million J/\u03c8 events collected at the BESII detector, the upper limit on the branching fraction was improved to be 1.0 \u00d7 10 \u22126 at the 95% C.L. [8], which is still far from the expectations from K 0 \u2212K 0 oscillation and EPR.",

The branching fraction of J/\u03c8 \u2192 K S K L is determined to be B(J/\u03c8 \u2192 K S K L ) = (1.93 \u00b1 0.01 (stat.) \u00b1 0.05 (syst.)) \u00d7 10 \u22124 , which agrees with the BESII measurement [1] while discrepancy with the CLEO data [2] persists. Compared with the world average value listed in the PDG [3], the relative precision is greatly improved, while the central value is consistent. With regard to the search for the CP and Bose-Einstein statistics violating process J/\u03c8 \u2192 K S K S , an upper limit on its branching fraction is set at the 95% C.L. to be B(J/\u03c8 \u2192 K S K S ) < 1.4 \u00d7 10 \u22128 , which is an improvement by two orders in magnitude compared to the best previous searches [7,8]. The upper limit reaches the order of the EPR expectations [5].",
