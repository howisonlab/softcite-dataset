Approximately 36 million like-sign pairs of well-measured charged tracks from about 0.8 million hadronic Z decays are used. This data sample is identical to that of Ref. [1]. The same event mixing technique is used to construct \u03c1 0 as in Ref. [1]. The minimum-bias pp data were collected by the atlas detector at a center-of-mass energy of \u221a s = 7 TeV. The sample contains approximately 1.8 \u00d7 10 9 like-sign charged track pairs from approximately 10 7 events. The acceptance in pseudorapidity is |\u03b7| < 2.5. This data sample is identical to the 7 TeV sample used in the recent atlas paper on BEC [4]. However the new results reported here, which are taken from a Ph.D. thesis [5], use, unless otherwise stated, a reference sample constructed by the opposite-hemisphere (OHP) method where the three-momentum, p of one of the particles of the pair is replaced by \u2212 p. The recent atlas paper [4] used unlike-sign pairs to construct \u03c1 0 , which is unsuitable for studying the region of anti-correlation, since the \u03c1 0 meson is a dominant feature there. The Durham and jade algorithms are used to classify e + e \u2212 events according to the number of jets. The number of jets in a particular event depends on the jet resolution parameter of the algorithm, y cut . We define y D 23 (y J 23 ) as the value of y cut at which the number of jets in the event changes from two to three using the respective algorithms. Small y 23 corresponds to narrow two-jet events, large y 23 to events with three (or more) well-separated jets. The two algorithms lead to similar results.",

The dependences with unlike-sign (ULS) reference sample are markedly different from those with the other samples. Whereas R increases somewhat less than linearly with N for the other reference samples, it appears to saturate for the ULS sample. And, whereas R decreases approximately linearly with k t for the ULS sample, for the rotated reference sample it decreases only up to k t \u2248 450 MeV and then increases, and for the other reference samples it is first roughly constant with k t and then increases.

In examining the de- pendence of R on charged track multiplicity and on k t , the parametrization of Eq. (3a) is used (with R a given by Eq. (3b) for e + e \u2212 and a free parameter for pp). The dependence of R on k t with respect to the thrust axis for e + e \u2212 and with respect to the beam axis for pp is shown in Fig. 4 for the \u03c4-model parametrization with R a a free parameter is shown in Fig. 4. The behavior of two-jet e + e \u2212 seems similar to pp, although the error bars are large. For both e + e \u2212 and pp, R is found [5,7] to increase with multiplicity (not shown). Further, for e + e \u2212 R is found [7] to increase with 'jettiness', as measured by y 23 .",

Here the rapidity, y E , is defined with respect to the thrust axis with the positive thrust axis chosen to be in the same hemisphere as the most energetic jet. Then y E > 1 selects almost always tracks from the most energetic quark jet, and y E < \u22121 selects mostly tracks from the other quark jet with the contribution of tracks from the gluon jet increasing as y 23 increases, i.e., as the events become more three-jetlike. The intermediate y E region contains tracks from the gluon jet and low-energy tracks from both quark jets. One observes that R is roughly independent of y 23 for y E > 1. This value of R is also found for y E < \u22121 in the case of two-jet events. These are the situations of 'pure' quark jets. As y 23 increases R for y E < \u22121 also increases, reflecting the increasing contribution of tracks from the gluon. The region \u22121 < y E < 1 has a larger value of R for two-jet events, and this value increases with y 23 . For three-jet events, where the gluon contributes to both \u22121 < y E < 1 and y E < \u22121, the values of R are approximately equal.",

Here results are shown in Fig. 6 for R L and R side for various selections of y D 23 . One sees that R L is independent of y 23 , while R side increases with 'jettiness'. Thus the increase in R occurs mainly in the transverse plane. This is consistent with the increase in R being due to the increasing hardness of the gluon, which was seen in the rapidity dependence above. A large source of systematic uncertainty on the parameter values is the range of Q over which the fit is performed. A higher upper limit, Q U , of the fit range gives more data to determine the baseline, which in turn affects the values of the parameters describing BEC and BEAC. Clearly, Q U should be chosen well beyond the anti-correlation region. Fig. 7 and Table 1 show this effect. The values of the parameters change drastically when the upper limit, Q U , is increased from 2 to 3 GeV. As Q U is further increased the change is less, but still large. Clearly the parametrization does not fully describe the data. Nevertheless, it is much better than all the other parametrizations that were tried. It is also worth noting that the value of \u03b1 is quite different from the value \u03b1 = 0.41 \u00b1 0.02 +0.04 \u22120.06 found for two-jet e + e \u2212 events [1].",

Fig. 8 shows the dependence of the BEAC on track multiplicity. The anti-correlation dip is deeper and at somewhat higher Q for two-jet e + e \u2212 than for pp. With increasing N the minimum moves to lower Q; this effect is larger in pp than in e + e \u2212 . The dip also becomes less deep as N increases, an effect also noticed by cms [6]. Fig. 9 shows the dependence of the BEAC on y J 23 . It is seen that the anti-correlation dip becomes deeper and its minimum moves slighlty lower in Q as the 'jettiness' increases, i.e., as one moves from two-to three-jet events. Fig. 10 shows the dependence of the BEAC on k t . Little dependence is seen for two-jet e + e \u2212 data. For pp minimum bias data, the depth of the dip decreases with k t , but the position of the minimum is approximately constant. The \u03c4-model, which is closely related to the string picture, provides a reasonable explanation of both the BEC peak and the BEAC dip in both e + e \u2212 and minimum bias pp interactions. Of all the parametrizations tried, only that of the \u03c4-model survives as a candidate to explain the data. Another possible explanation is that the anti-correlation arises because of the non-zero size of the pion. To discover which of these explanations (or what combination of them) is the best explanation requires detailed investigation of both BEC and BEAC.",
