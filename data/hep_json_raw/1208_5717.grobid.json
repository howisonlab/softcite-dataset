The yields and the transverse momentum spectra d 2 N/dydp T at midrapidity |y| < 0.5 in the range 0 < p T < 6 GeV/c for K * (892) 0 and 0.4 < p T < 6 GeV/c for \u03c6(1020) are reported and compared to model predictions. Using the yield of pions, kaons, and baryons measured previously by ALICE at \u221a s = 7 TeV, the ratios K * /K \u2212 , \u03c6/K * , \u03c6/K \u2212 , \u03c6/\u03c0 \u2212 , and ( + )/\u03c6 are presented. The values of the K * /K \u2212 , \u03c6/K * and \u03c6/K \u2212 ratios are similar to those found at lower centre-of-mass energies. In contrast, the \u03c6/\u03c0 \u2212 ratio, which has been observed to increase with energy, seems to saturate above 200 GeV. The ( + )/\u03c6 ratio in the p T range 1-5 GeV/c is found to be in good agreement with the prediction of the HIJING/BB v2.0 model with a strong colour field.",

            "text": "The study of resonance production plays an important role both in elementary and in heavy ion collisions. In pp and e + e \u2212 collisions it contributes to the understanding of hadron production [1,2] as the decay products of resonances represent a large fraction of the final state particles. In addition, it provides a reference for tuning event generators inspired by Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). In heavy ion collisions, resonances are a sensitive probe of the dynamical evolution of the fireball. Due to their short lifetime (a few fm/c) a significant fraction of resonances decay inside the hot and dense medium and their hadronic daughters interact with the medium during the fireball expansion [3][4][5].",

The data analysis was carried out for K * (\u03c6) on a sample of 80 (60) million minimum bias pp collisions collected by the ALICE experiment. The resonances were identified via their main decay channel K * \u2212\u2192 \u03c0 \u00b1 + K \u2213 and \u03c6 \u2212\u2192 K + + K \u2212 . Tracks were reconstructed by the main ALICE tracking devices, the Time Projection Chamber (TPC) and the Inner Tracking System (ITS). The TPC and Time of Flight (TOF) detectors were used to identify pions and kaons. The measured spectra are compared to two QCD-based event generators, PHOJET [9,10] and PYTHIA [11].",

In addition, a coincidence was required with signals from two beam pick-up counters, one on each side of the interaction region, indicating the passage of proton bunches. The trigger selection efficiency for inelastic collisions was estimated to be 85.2 % with a +6.2 % and \u22123 % uncertainty [21]. During the data-taking period, the luminosity at the ALICE interaction point was kept in the range 0.6-1.2 \u00d7 10 29 cm \u22122 s \u22121 .

When a TOF signal is present, a particle identification cut of 3\u03c3 TOF is also applied. For the K * analysis, both pions and kaons are identified. Two different strategies were followed. For tracks with TOF signals, a TPC dE/dx cut of 5\u03c3 TPC was applied and a TOF cut of 3\u03c3 TOF (2\u03c3 TOF ) was applied for tracks with momenta below (above) 1.5 GeV/c.

In the event mixing method the shape of the uncorrelated background was estimated from the invariant mass distribution of unlike-sign K\u03c0 or KK combinations from different events. To avoid mismatch due to different acceptances and to assure a similar event structure, tracks from events with similar vertex positions z ( z < 1 cm) and track multiplicities n ( n < 10) were mixed. To reduce statistical uncertainties each event was mixed with 10 other events.

The uncertainty in the normalization was estimated by varying the normalization region and is included in the quoted systematic uncertainty for signal extraction. After background subtraction a residual background remains. This is due in part to an imperfect description of the combinatorial background but mainly caused by a real correlated background.

            "text": "In order to extract the meson yields, the raw counts (N RAW ) were corrected for the decay branching ratio [26] and for losses due to pion/kaon in-flight decays, geometrical acceptance, and detector efficiency (N cor = N RAW /(A \u00d7 )BR, where BR indicates the decay branching ratio). The product of acceptance and efficiency (A \u00d7 ) was determined for K * and \u03c6 from Monte Carlo simulations with the PYTHIA 6.4 event generator (tune Perugia 0 [15]) and a GEANT3-based simulation of the ALICE detector response. About 60 M Monte Carlo events, with the same vertex distribution as the measured events, were analyzed in exactly the same way as the data. The dependence on the event generator was estimated to be below 1 % by comparing PYTHIA and PHO-JET simulated events. The A \u00d7 was determined from the Monte Carlo simulations as the ratio of the number of reconstructed resonances to the number of those generated, differentially as a function of rapidity and transverse momentum. The transverse momentum dependence is shown in Fig. 5 for K * and \u03c6 mesons. The decrease in A \u00d7 at low p T is due to the minimum p T requirement for reconstructed tracks, while the different behaviour for \u03c6 and K * is due to the different Q-value of their decay (31.1 MeV for \u03c6 and 262.7 MeV for K * ).  Table 1 Finally, corrections for the trigger efficiency ( trigger ) and the required primary vertex range ( vert ) were applied in order to obtain the absolute resonance yields per inelastic collision:",

The uncertainty due to the raw yield extraction method was found to be \u00b12-28 % (2-10 %) for K * (\u03c6). It was estimated by changing the mass range considered for the fit and the order of the polynomial for the residual background function (from first through third (second) order for K * (\u03c6)). Finally, variations in the yield due to the method used to estimate the combinatorial background (like-sign and event-mixing method and also analytic function for \u03c6) were incorporated into the systematic uncertainties. For the K * a relativistic Breit-Wigner function was used to fit the mass peak in addition to the non-relativistic version. In the case of the K * a rather large systematic uncertainty was estimated for the higher p T bins, due to the presence of a correlated background. The uncertainty introduced by the tracking and PID efficiency was estimated to be \u00b18 % (8 %) and \u00b11-6 % (1.5 %) respectively in the case of K * (\u03c6) by varying the kinematical and PID cuts on the daughter tracks. An additional \u00b11-4 % uncertainty was added for the K * due to differences observed in the TOF matching efficiency between data and Monte Carlo. The uncertainty on the yield contained in the extrapolated part of the \u03c6 spectrum was estimated to be \u00b120 % using different fit functions. The normalization to the number of inelastic collisions leads to a +6.2 % and \u22123 % uncertainty in the yield of the measured particles. The resulting overall systematic uncertainty is +10 \u22129 % ( +12.5 \u221211 %) for the K * (\u03c6) yield dN/dy and \u00b12 % (3 %) for the average transverse momentum p T .",

In contrast, the slope parameters are significantly higher than the values obtained at RHIC, T = 202 \u00b1 14 \u00b1 11 MeV for \u03c6, and T = 223 \u00b1 8 \u00b1 9 MeV for K * [3] (the latter was obtained  by an exponential fit and can therefore not be directly compared). The total yields dN/dy and the mean transverse momentum p T , including statistical and systematic uncertainties, are listed in Table 3. The values of dN/dy were obtained by integrating the spectra in the measured range and extrapolating to zero p T with the fitted L\u00e9vy-Tsallis function. The contribution of the low-p T extrapolation is negligible for the K * and about 15 \u00b1 3 % for the \u03c6. The mean transverse momentum was estimated in the range 0 < p T < 6 GeV/c using the L\u00e9vy-Tsallis function. However, similar values are obtained when calculating the mean from the measured data points, using the fit only to extrapolate into the unmeasured p T regions. In addition to the point to point systematic uncertainties previously described, an exponential fit was also used to estimate the systematic uncertainty in p T due to a different choice of fit function. Compared to pp collisions at 200 GeV [3,5,29], the mean p T rises by about 30 % (Fig. 7) and the yield per inelastic collision increases by about a factor of two, which is similar to the overall increase of charged particle multiplicity [30,31].",

For PYTHIA, tunes D6T (109), ATLAS-CSC (306), Perugia 0 (320) and Perugia 2011 (350) were used. The best agreement is found for the PYTHIA Perugia 2011 tune, which reproduces both the K * spectrum and the high p T part (p T > 3 GeV/c) of the \u03c6 spectrum rather well. PHO-JET and ATLAS-CSC very significantly overestimate the low momentum part (p T < 1 GeV/c) of the transverse momentum distribution but reproduce the high momentum distribution of both mesons well. The PYTHIA D6T tune gives the best description at low p T , but deviates from the data at p T > 2 GeV/c. Finally, the PYTHIA Perugia 0 tune underestimates the meson yield for p T larger than 0.5 GeV/c. Similar comparisons for the mid-and forward-rapidity \u03c6 spectrum in pp collisions at \u221a s = 0.9 TeV [33] and 7 TeV [32], respectively, show that the \u03c6 spectrum is rather well reproduced by the ATLAS-CSC and D6T tunes, while the Perugia 0 and 2011 tunes underestimate the data. Moreover the PYTHIA tunes generally underestimate strange meson and hyperon production in 7 TeV pp collisions [13,39], while the Perugia 2011 tune gives a good description of kaon production in pp collisions at 7 TeV [12].",

In pp reactions, particle abundances have been successfully described by statistical-thermal models. Now, using measured identified particle yields, an energy-independent value of 0.2 for \u03bb s has been extracted in e + e \u2212 , pp, and pp collisions at \u221a s < 1 TeV [42,46]. Using the \u03c6 and K * yields presented in this paper and stable particle results measured by ALICE at the same energy [12], we find the following values for particle ratios in pp collisions at 7 TeV: K * /K \u2212 = 0.35 \u00b1 0.001 (stat.) \u00b1 0.04 (syst.), \u03c6/K * = 0.33 \u00b1 0.004 (stat.) \u00b1 0.05 (syst.), \u03c6/K \u2212 = 0.11 \u00b1 0.001 (stat.) \u00b1 0.02 (syst.), \u03c6/\u03c0 \u2212 = 0.014 \u00b1 0.0002 (stat.) \u00b1 0.002 (syst.). Due to the fact that the same data were analyzed to extract both resonance and non-resonance (\u03c0, K) yields, the uncertainties due to the absolute normalization cancel and are therefore not included in the systematic uncertainties of the ratios. These ratios are shown in Figs. 10 and 11, together with the results obtained at lower incident energies in pp, e + e \u2212 , and A-A collisions.",

            "text": "In microscopic models where soft particle production is governed by string fragmentation, strange hadron yields are predicted to depend on the string tension [8]. Multi-strange baryons, and in particular the ratio /\u03c6, are expected to be very sensitive to this effect [14]. The \u03c6 yield is compared to the \u2212 + + data measured by ALICE at the same incident energy [13] in Fig. 12 as a function of transverse momentum. The full line represents the PYTHIA model (Perugia 2011 tune), which is a factor 1.5-5 below the data. While this tune describes the \u03c6 spectrum reasonably well above 2-3 GeV/c, it underpredicts multistrange baryon yields by a large factor [13]. The dashed line, which is very close to the data, represents the prediction of a model with increased string tension, the HIJING/BB v2.0 model with a Strong Colour Field (SCF), for pp collisions at 5.5 TeV [14]. This is a model that combines multiple minijet production via perturbative QCD with soft longitudinal string excitation and hadronization. In this case the SCF effects are modeled by varying the effective string tensions that controls the qq and qqqq pair creation rates and the strangeness sup- pression factor. The value of string tension used in this calculation is \u03ba = 2 GeV/fm, equal to the value used to fit the high baryon/meson ratio at \u221a s = 1.8 TeV reported by the CDF collaboration [63]. The same calculation at 7 TeV yields a \u223c10 % higher ratio [64]. Higher values of the string tension (\u223c3 GeV/fm) also successfully reproduce also the ( + )/\u03c6 ratio in Au-Au collisions at \u221a s = 200 GeV [14], but overestimate the ( + )/K 0 S at 7 TeV [8].",
