The online event selection is performed by a trigger [7], which consists of a hardware stage, based on information from the calorimeter and muon systems, followed by a software stage, in which all charged particles with p T > 500 (300) MeV/c are reconstructed for 2011 (2012) data, where p T is the transverse momentum [7]. At the hardware trigger stage, events are required to contain a muon or dimuon pair with high p T , or a hadron, photon or electron with high transverse energy deposited in the calorimeters. The software trigger requires a two-, three-or four-track secondary vertex with a significant displacement from any primary proton-proton interaction vertices (PVs). At least one charged particle must have a p T > 1.7 (1.6) GeV/c for 2011 (2012) data, and be inconsistent with originating from a PV. A multivariate algorithm [8] is used for the identification of secondary vertices consistent with the decay of a b hadron. Simulated samples of the signal, the normalisation channels and backgrounds produced in pp collisions are generated using Pythia [9] with a specific LHCb configuration [10]. Decays of hadronic particles are described by EvtGen [11], in which finalstate radiation is generated using Photos [12]. The interaction of the generated particles with the detector, and its response, are implemented using the Geant4 toolkit [13] as described in Ref. [14].",

This association makes it possible to use a data-driven method for the correction and systematic uncertainty estimation on the trigger efficiencies [7]. To take advantage of the similarity between the signal and the normalisation channels, which helps to minimize the systematic uncertainty on the ratio of their efficiencies, candidates are classified in one of the following two hardware trigger categories.

These tracks are referred to as clones, and are suppressed by requiring that the opening angle between any same-charged tracks in the candidate is larger than 0.5 mrad. This selection removes 2% of candidates in the signal sample and 0.1% in the normalisation sample. If multiple \u039b 0 b candidates are reconstructed in one single event, one candidate is chosen at random in the following two cases. First, if the proton from the \u039b + c decays is exchanged with that directly from the \u039b 0 b decays, forming two candidates with nearly the same \u039b 0 b mass. Second, if a track from one candidate shares a segment with a track from another candidate. With these criteria, 2.5% of candidates in the signal sample and 0.1% in the normalisation sample are vetoed. After these selections, 0.8% of events in the signal sample and 0.2% in the normalisation sample contain multiple \u039b 0 b candidates.

From parity and angular momentum conservation, it followsthat L = 1. The width also depends on the Blatt-Weisskopf factor B L (q, q 0 , d)[26], where the value of d is set to be 1 fm (5 GeV\u22121 in natural units). The ratio of widths of the Gaussian resolution functions for the \u03a3 0 c and \u03a3 * 0 c resonances is fixed from simulation to be 1.96.

Many of the systematic uncertainties cancel out in the measurement of the ratio of branching fractions, with the remaining systematic uncertainties stemming from the yield determination. The value of d in the Blatt-Weisskopf factor is varied between 1.5 and 0.5 fm, with the largest variation for each resonance taken as the systematic uncertainty, resulting in 3.4% for the \u03a3 0 c resonance and 1.9% for the \u03a3 * 0 c resonance. The background shape is changed to a third-order polynomial, with a relative difference of 1.7% for the \u03a3 0 c resonance and 10.6% for the \u03a3 * 0 c resonance taken as the systematic uncertainty. The masses and widths of the \u03a3 ( * )0 c resonances are allowed to float within one standard deviation of their known values [15], resulting in a 3.8% difference of the raw yield for the \u03a3 0 c resonance and 2.2% difference for the \u03a3 * 0 c resonance.
