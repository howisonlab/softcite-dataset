The algorithm exploits the correlation of the flavour of a B meson with the charge of a reconstructed secondary charm hadron from the decay of the other b hadron produced in the proton-proton collision. Charm hadron candidates are identified in a number of fully or partially reconstructed Cabibbo-favoured decay modes. The algorithm is calibrated on the self-tagged decay modes B + \u2192 J/\u03c8 K + and B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8 K * 0 using 3.0 fb \u22121 of data collected by the LHCb experiment at pp centre-of-mass energies of 7 TeV and 8 TeV.

            "text": "Measurements that involve mixing and time-dependent CP asymmetries in decays of neutral B mesons require the identification of their flavour content at production. This is achieved via various flavour tagging algorithms that exploit information from the rest of the pp collision event. Same-side (SS) taggers look for particles produced in association with the signal B meson during the hadronization of the b quark [1]. The d or s partner of the light valence quark of the signal B has a roughly 50% chance of hadronizing into a charged pion or kaon. Since b quarks are mostly produced in bb pairs, the flavour content of the signal B meson can also be deduced from available information on the opposite-side (OS) b hadron, whose flavour is the opposite of the signal B meson at the production time. OS muon and electron taggers look for leptons originating from semileptonic b \u2192 cW transitions of the b hadron, and an OS kaon tagger looks for kaons coming from b \u2192 c \u2192 s transitions. A vertex-charge tagger reconstructs the decay vertex of the OS b hadron and predicts its charge by weighting the charges of its decay products according to their transverse momentum. The OS taggers employed by LHCb are described in Ref. [2] and the SS taggers in Refs. [3,4]. This paper reports a new flavour tagging algorithm for the LHCb experiment that relies on reconstructed decays of charm hadrons produced in the OS b hadron decay. For the development and evaluation of the tagging algorithm, signal B meson and charm hadron candidates are reconstructed using data from 3 fb \u22121 of integrated luminosity collected by LHCb at 7 TeV and 8 TeV centre-of-mass energies in 2011 and 2012, respectively.",

This classifier then calculates a predicted mistag probability \u03b7 for each decision made.

The detector includes a high-precision tracking system consisting of a silicon-strip vertex detector surrounding the pp interaction region [11], a large-area silicon-strip detector located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4 Tm, and three stations of silicon-strip detectors and straw drift tubes [12] placed downstream of the magnet. The tracking system provides a measurement of momentum, p, of charged particles with a relative uncertainty that varies from 0.5% at low momentum to 1.0% at 200 GeV/c. The minimum distance of a track to a primary vertex (PV), the impact parameter, is measured with a resolution of (15+29/p T ) \u00b5m, where p T is the component of the momentum transverse to the beam, in GeV/c. Different types of charged hadrons in the momentum range 2-100 GeV/c are distinguished using information from two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors [13]. Photons, electrons and hadrons are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter and a hadronic calorimeter. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers [14]. The online event selection is performed by a trigger [15], which consists of a hardware stage, based on information from the calorimeter and muon systems, followed by a software stage, which applies a full event reconstruction.",

For D 0 decays through the dominant Cabibbo-favoured process D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 X, the kaon charge determines the flavour of the charm hadron, and thereby that of the parent B hadron (the effect of D 0 mixing is negligible). The OS charm tagging algorithm uses charm hadron candidates reconstructed in a number of decay modes, chosen for their relatively large branching fractions, listed in Table 1. These include fully reconstructed hadronic modes with a single charged kaon in the final state, partially reconstructed hadronic modes with an unobserved neutral pion, and partially reconstructed semileptonic modes. Table 1 also reports the breakdown of the charm tagger's performance by decay mode. The relative rate and relative power of each mode are the amounts that it contributes to the algorithm's total tagging rate \u03b5 tag and tagging power \u03b5 eff , which are presented in Section 6 and Table 3. The algorithm predicts the flavour of the signal B meson using the charge of the kaon in the same manner as the OS kaon tagger; however, the selection based on the reconstruction of c hadrons (rather than the selection of kaons based on their individual kinematic properties) results in a different set of selected kaons and provides a complementary source of tagging information.",

The dominant impact comes from B 0 -B 0 oscillation and from the contributions of \"wrong sign\" charm hadrons produced in b \u2192 ccq transitions. The impact of Cabibbo-suppressed D 0 \u2192 K + X decays is negligible, as these typically produce additional kaons and do not mimic modes used by the tagging algorithm, and doubly Cabibbo-suppressed decays such as D 0 \u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212 have a negligibly small branching fraction. Accounting for relative production rates of b hadrons, neutral B oscillation, and branching fractions of the decay modes used in the tagger, the irreducible mistag probabilities for D 0 , D + and \u039b + c modes are estimated to be 23%, 19%, and 6%, respectively. In addition to the irreducible mistag probability arising from physics effects, the charm hadron candidates are contaminated by combinatorial and partially reconstructed b and c hadron background that can lead to an incorrect flavour tag result. For each mode, the charm tagger uses a multivariate algorithm that combines geometric and kinematic quantities and properties of the c hadron candidate and its daughters. The resulting discriminating variable is used both to suppress the combinatorial background and to predict the corresponding mistag probability for the surviving candidate.",

The fit attempts to match the calibrated value \u03c9(\u03b7 i ) to \u03c9 i in each bin by adjusting the calibration parameters. A projection of the fitted model to the mixing asymmetry is shown in Fig. 3. The values of the calibration parameters obtained from the fit are given in Table 2.

Assessing the actual gain in performance depends on the method of combination and calibration, as well as on the set of tagging algorithms being combined. Due to correlations with other tagging algorithms, in particular the OS kaon and vertex-charge taggers, the maximum possible increase in tagging power after the addition of the charm tagging algorithm is less than its individual tagging power. The performance of the combination of the current OS tagging algorithms with and without the addition of the charm tagger has been measured on the B + \u2192 J/\u03c8 K + data sample. The absolute net gain in tagging power using the current combination algorithm is found to be around 0.11%, compared to the current total OS tagging power of about 2.5% [3,[6][7][8].",

The flavour tagger uses boosted decision tree algorithms trained on simulated data, and has been calibrated and evaluated on data using the self-tagged decay B + \u2192 J/\u03c8 K + . Its tagging power for data in this channel is found to be (0.30 \u00b1 0.01 (stat) \u00b1 0.01 (syst))%. The calibration has been cross-checked using the decay B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8 K * 0 , giving consistent results. The tagging power is found to be higher for the decays B 0 \u2192 D \u2212 \u03c0 + and B 0 s \u2192 D \u2212 s \u03c0 + , at (0.40 \u00b1 0.02 (stat) \u00b1 0.01 (syst))% and (0.39 \u00b1 0.03 (stat) \u00b1 0.01 (syst))%, respectively.",
