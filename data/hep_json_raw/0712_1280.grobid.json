            "text": "The MINOS experiment relies upon very precise knowledge of the expected energy spectrum of \u03bd \u00b5 arriving at the FD in the absence of oscillations. In part, small systematic uncertainties are achieved by utilizing a \u03bd \u00b5 beam derived from the NuMI beam line, whose spectrum can be controlled. In part, such low systematic uncertainties are achieved by having two detectors, the first of which (the ND) measures directly the spectrum in the absence of oscillations. Because MINOS is a two-detector experiment, the uncertainties for the oscillation measurement are best characterized by the uncertainty in the ratio of FD to ND fluxes, \"F/N\". Figure 1 compares the \u03bd \u00b5 spectrum observed in the ND to our beam MC. The experiment relies upon two analysis strategies to reduce systematic uncertainties from the beam spectrum. The first is a set of beam data used to measure or constrain uncertainties due to particle focusing in the beam line. The second is a flexible beam design which allows us to manipulate the spectrum in known fashion so as to infer directly the production of particles off the NuMI target, rather than relying solely upon external measurements. Each of these analyses are discussed in turn. The MINOS data is compared to the NuMI flux calculation [1], which relies on the FLUKA2005 [3] cascade Monte Carlo to predict the flux of hadrons off the target.",

The flux of \u03bd e which is intrinsic in the beam, arising predominantly from muon decay (where the muons are produced in pion decay) and K e3 decays, comprise a background for this search. The uncertainties in pion and kaon yields off the target thus contribute a background uncertainty for the \u03bd \u00b5 \u2192\u03bd e measurement. The constraints on these secondary yields provided by the \u03bd \u00b5 , however, limit the uncertainty on the instrinsic background to ~6%, as is discussed by Mayly Sanchez at this workshop [12].",
