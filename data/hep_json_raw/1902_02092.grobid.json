            "text": "The LHCb collaboration has observed many \u039b 0 b \u2192 J/\u03c8 X [1-7] and \u039b 0 b \u2192 \u03c8(2S)X decays [5,8], where X indicates a final-state particle system. Ratios of branching fractions of b-hadron decays into \u03c8(2S)X and J/\u03c8 X provide useful information on the production of charmonia in b-hadron decays. These ratios can be used to test factorisation of amplitudes. The ATLAS collaboration has previously measured the ratio of the branching fractions to be B(\u039b 0 b \u2192 \u03c8(2S)\u039b)/B(\u039b 0 b \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u039b) = 0.501 \u00b1 0.033 (stat) \u00b1 0.019 (syst) [9]. This result differs by 2.8 \u03c3 from a theoretical prediction in the framework of the covariant quark model, B(\u039b 0 b \u2192 \u03c8(2S)\u039b)/B(\u039b 0 b \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u039b) = 0.8 \u00b1 0.1 [10,11]. Variations of the used form factors [12,13] lead to predictions in the range of 0.65 to 1.14 [11]. Also the result differs significantly from similar measurements in the B systems, B(B 0 \u2192 \u03c8(2S)K 0 S )/B(B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8 K 0 S ) = 0.66 \u00b1 0.06 and B(B + \u2192 \u03c8(2S)K + )/B(B + \u2192 J/\u03c8 K + ) = 0.615 \u00b1 0.019 [14]. In this paper the measurement of the branching fraction of the decay \u039b 0 b \u2192 \u03c8(2S)\u039b by LHCb is presented. Throughout this paper, the notation of a decay always implies the inclusion of the charge-conjugate process. Determining the branching fraction of \u039b 0 b \u2192 \u03c8(2S)\u039b decays relative to the branching fraction of \u039b 0 b \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u039b cancels most experimental uncertainties. A measurement with improved precision helps to better understand this possible discrepancy and sets new constraints on the available form-factor models [11].",

            "text": "The LHCb detector [15,16] is a single-arm forward spectrometer covering the pseudorapidity range 2 < \u03b7 < 5, designed for the study of particles containing b or c quarks. The detector includes a high-precision tracking system consisting of a silicon-strip vertex detector (VELO) surrounding the pp interaction region [17], a large-area silicon-strip detector located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4 Tm, and three stations of silicon-strip detectors and straw drift tubes [18] placed downstream of the magnet. The tracking system provides a measurement of the momentum, p, of charged particles with a relative uncertainty that varies from 0.5% at low momentum to 1.0% at 200 GeV/c. The minimum distance of a track to a primary vertex (PV), the impact parameter (IP), is measured with a resolution of (15 + 29/p T ) \u00b5m, where p T is the component of the momentum transverse to the beam, in GeV/c. Different types of charged hadrons are distinguished using information from two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors [19]. Photons, electrons and hadrons are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter and a hadronic calorimeter. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers [20]. The online event selection is performed by a trigger [21], which consists of a hardware stage, based on information from the muon system, followed by a software stage, which applies a full event reconstruction. In the simulation, pp collisions are generated using Pythia [22,23] with a specific LHCb configuration [24]. Decays of hadronic particles are described by EvtGen [25]. The interaction of the generated particles with the detector, and its response, are implemented using the Geant4 toolkit [26,27] as described in ref. [28].",

To ensure a precise efficiency determination, fiducial cuts on the \u039b 0 b baryon, p T (\u039b 0 b ) < 20 GeV/c and 2 < \u03b7(\u039b 0 b ) < 4.5 are applied. The signal efficiency is evaluated separately for each channel and track type, using simulations and crosschecked with data. The simulation assumes unpolarised decays but is corrected using theory predictions [10] for both decay channels. Sources of inefficiencies are the geometrical acceptance of the detector, the trigger, the track reconstruction, and the candidate selection. The last three efficiencies depend on the kinematics of the \u039b 0 b baryon, which is not perfectly simulated. To account for the mismodelling, these efficiencies are determined in bins of p T (\u039b 0 b ) and \u03b7(\u039b 0 b ). The same binning scheme, consisting of seven bins for each of the two variables, is used for both decay channels. The binning scheme is designed such that all bins are uniformly populated, with at least 100 entries in each bin. The resulting efficiency for a given candidate is determined by linear interpolation of the binned efficiency model to reduce effects arising from the choice of the binning scheme. For the interpolation, the mean value in each bin is used and additional bins are added to ensure interpolation at the boundaries. The resulting efficiency functions together with the distribution of the corresponding signal candidates are shown in figure 1.",

            "text": "The signal yield is determined using an extended unbinned maximum likelihood fit to the reconstructed \u039b 0 b mass in the range 5350 to 5750 MeV/c 2 separately for both decay channels and track types. The fit model for the reconstructed \u039b 0 b mass consists of several components. The signal is modelled with a double-sided Hypatia function [29], where the tail parameters are fixed to values obtained from fits to the simulation. The combinatorial background is modelled with an exponential function. A background due to B 0 \u2192 \u03c8K 0 S decays, where the K 0 S meson decays to two pions and one of the pions is misidentified as a proton, is vetoed in the long-track sample by applying additional particle identification requirements. In the downstream-track sample this component is modelled with a kerneldensity estimation using a Gaussian kernel [30] obtained from simulated B 0 \u2192 \u03c8K 0 in the long-track sample due to the sum of the large lifetimes of the \u039e and the \u039b baryons. Thus, the \u039b \u2192 p\u03c0 \u2212 decay only happens in less than 2% of the \u039e \u2212 b \u2192 \u03c8\u039e \u2212 decays inside the VELO. In the downstream-track sample this background is modelled with a kernel-density estimation using a Gaussian kernel obtained from simulated \u039e \u2212 b \u2192 \u03c8\u039e \u2212 decays. The number of observed signal events is determined from a fit to unweighted invariant-mass distributions. The resulting fit is shown in figure 2, separately for long and downstream tracks, and the resulting yields for each data sample are shown in table 1. In a second fit, the efficiency-corrected yields are obtained assigning to each candidate a weight given by the inverse of the efficiency. This fit to the two weighted invariant-mass distributions is shown in figure 3 for each data sample and the resulting efficiency-corrected signal yields for each data sample are reported in table 2.",

            "text": "The sources of systematic uncertainty are summarised in table 3. The effect of each of these sources on the measured ratio is evaluated independently and is quoted as a relative uncertainty on the measured ratio of branching fractions. These relative uncertainties are summed in quadrature to obtain the total systematic uncertainty. All efficiencies are evaluated from simulated data, therefore the precision is limited by the size of the simulated dataset. This effect is determined by varying the binned efficiencies within binomial uncertainties and re-evaluating the efficiency-weighted signal yield. The result varies by 1.1 %, which is assigned as the systematic uncertainty. The effect of the chosen number of bins in both dimensions for the efficiency determination is determined by varying the numbers of bins between five and ten in each dimension independently. The largest difference compared to the baseline result is a change of 1.6% in the ratio of yields, which is assigned as systematic uncertainty. To estimate a systematic uncertainty for the trigger efficiency, kinematically similar channels with higher rates, B + \u2192 J/\u03c8 K + and B + \u2192 \u03c8(2S)K + , are used [31]. The resulting trigger efficiency on data is compatible with that obtained on simulation, but the systematic uncertainty due to the size of the sample used for this method is 1.2 %. The effect of using alternative fit models that describe the mass distributions are evaluated using pseudoexperiments. Candidates are generated using an alternative model and then fitted with the default model. The 1.6% relative difference between the fitted and generated yield is assigned as systematic uncertainty. The used correction on the helicity angles in simulation is taken from theory predictions [10]. An alternative approach is to use the measured distributions from data and this leads to a difference of 1.3% to the baseline result, which is assigned as systematic uncertainty. The effect of neglecting peaking backgrounds for long-track candidates is evaluated by including the \u039e \u2212 b \u2192 \u03c8\u039e \u2212 and B 0 \u2192 \u03c8K 0 S components in the long-track sample fits and",

The consistency of the results has been checked by repeating the analysis separately with datasets with different magnet polarities and years of data taking.
