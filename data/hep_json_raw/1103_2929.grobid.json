The W boson charge asymmetry is mainly sensitive to valence quark distributions [1] via the dominant production process ud(\u016bd) \u2192 W +(\u2212) and provides complementary information to that obtained from measurements of inclusive deep inelastic scattering crosssections at the HERA electron-proton collider [2][3][4][5]. The HERA data do not strongly constrain the ratio between u and d quarks in the kinematic regime of low x, where x is the proton momentum fraction carried by the parton [6]. A precise measurement of the W asymmetry at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) [7] on the other hand, can contribute significantly to the understanding of PDFs and quantum chromodynamics (QCD) in the parton momentum fraction range 10 \u22123 x 10 \u22121 [8].",

The ID consists of pixel and silicon microstrip (SCT) detectors, surrounded by a transition radiation tracker (TRT). The electromagnetic calorimeter is a lead liquid-argon (LAr) detector in the barrel and the endcap, and in the forward region copper LAr technology is used. Hadron calorimetry is based on two different detector technologies, with scintillator tiles or LAr as the active media, and with either steel, copper, or tungsten as the absorber material. There is a poorly instrumented transition region between the barrel and endcap calorimeter, 1.37 < |\u03b7| < 1.52, where electrons cannot be precisely measured. In view of a later combination, this motivates the binning in that region for the present muon analysis. The MS is based on three large superconducting toroids, and a system of three stations of chambers for trigger and precise tracking measurements. There is a transition between the barrel and endcap muon detectors around |\u03b7| = 1.05.",
