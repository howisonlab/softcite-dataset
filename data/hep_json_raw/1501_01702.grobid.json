The decay rates, including QCD corrections, can be expressed by an effective Hamiltonian and calculated using the Operator Product Expansion approach. In the lead-ing and next-to-leading order logarithmic approximation, the branching fractions and CP asymmetries are proportional to the dipole operators P 7 and P 8 [1].

In the following, charge-conjugate states are included implicitly. The X s+d states represent all possible hadronic final states derived from b \u2192 s\u03b3 or b \u2192 d\u03b3 transitions. The SM predicts A CP for the these two transitions in the ranges \u22120.6% \u2264 A CP (B \u2192 X s \u03b3) \u2264 2.8% and \u221262% \u2264 A CP (B \u2192 X d \u03b3) \u2264 14% [2]. Even though the individual CP -violating effects could be large, the CPviolating contributions cancel when both are considered inclusively due to CKM unitarity, and the theory errors cancel almost perfectly except for small U -spin breaking corrections [3], additionally, the inclusive asymmetry is insensitive to the choice of photon energy cutoff [4]. This precise SM prediction of A CP (B \u2192 X s+d \u03b3)=0, serves as a clean test for new CP -violating phases acting in the decays. New physics (NP) scenarios such as supersymmetric models with minimal flavor violation predict A CP (B \u2192 X s+d \u03b3) up to a level of +2 %. In more generic NP scenarios, the asymmetries A CP (B \u2192 X s \u03b3) and A CP (B \u2192 X d \u03b3) do not cancel and A CP (B \u2192 X s+d \u03b3) is the most sensitive observable, with values as large as 10% [3].",
