They are predicted by many extensions of the standard model (SM) of particle physics, such as theories invoking grand unification [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8], technicolor [9][10][11], or compositeness [12]. To satisfy experimental constraints on flavor changing neutral currents and other rare processes [13,14], it is generally assumed that there would be three types of LQs, each type coupled to leptons and quarks of its same generation.",

            "text": "Third-generation scalar LQs have recently received considerable theoretical interest, as their existence can explain the anomaly in the B \u2192 D\u03c4 \u03bd and B \u2192 D * \u03c4 \u03bd decay rates reported by the BaBar [15,16], Belle [17][18][19][20][21][22], and LHCb [23] Collaborations. These decay rates collectively deviate from the SM predictions by about four standard deviations [24], and large couplings to third-generation quarks and leptons could explain this anomaly [25][26][27][28]. The LQ could also provide consistent explanations for other anomalies in B physics reported by LHCb [29][30][31][32][33][34] and Belle [35]. The production cross sections and decay widths of LQs in proton-proton (pp) collisions are determined by the LQ's mass, m LQ ; its branching fraction \u03b2 to a charged lepton and a quark; and the Yukawa coupling \u03bb of the LQ-lepton-quark vertex. Leptoquarks can be produced in pairs via gluon fusion or quark-antiquark annihilation, and singly via quark-gluon fusion. Pair production of LQs does not depend on \u03bb, while single production does, and thus the sensitivity of searches for singly-produced LQs depends on \u03bb. At lower masses, the cross section for pair production is greater than that for single production. However, the single-LQ production cross section decreases more slowly with increasing m LQ , eventually exceeding that for pair production. If the third-generation LQ is responsible for the observed B physics anomalies, then a large value of \u03bb is favored (\u03bb \u223c m LQ measured in TeV), and the cross section for single production exceeds that for pair production for m LQ greater than 1.0-1.5 TeV [36].",

The particular LQ model used isR 2 , as discussed in ref. [43]. The branching fraction is assumed to be \u03b2 = 1, i.e. the LQ always decays to a \u03c4 lepton and a bottom quark. The Yukawa coupling of the LQ to a \u03c4 lepton and a bottom quark is set to be \u03bb = 1. The width \u0393 is calculated to be \u0393 = m LQ \u03bb 2 /(16\u03c0) [44], which is narrower than the experimental resolution over the considered search range.

The sum neut p T represents the same quantity for neutral hadrons and photons. The contribution of pileup photons and neutral hadrons is estimated from the scalar sum of the p T of charged hadrons originating from pileup vertices, ch, PU p T . This sum is multiplied by a factor of 1/2, which corresponds approximately to the ratio of neutral-to charged-hadron production in the hadronization process of inelastic pp collisions, as estimated from simulation. In this analysis, I e < 0.10 (I \u00b5 < 0.15) is used as an isolation requirement for the electron (muon). With these cut-off values, the combined efficiency of identification and isolation is around 80 (95)% for the electron (muon).

Charged PF candidates not associated with the primary vertex of the interaction are not considered when reconstructing jets. An offset correction is applied to jet energies to take into account the contribution from additional pp collisions within the same or nearby bunch crossings. Jet energy corrections are derived from simulation to bring the average measured response of jets to that of particle-level jets [70]. Further identification requirements are applied to distinguish genuine jets from those coming from pileup [71,72]. In this analysis, jets are required to have p T greater than 30 GeV and |\u03b7| less than 4.7, and must be separated from the selected leptons by a \u2206R of at least 0.5. Jets originating from the hadronization of bottom quarks are identified (b tagged) using the combined secondary vertex algorithm [73], which exploits observables related to the long lifetime and large mass of B hadrons. The chosen b tagging working point corresponds to an identification efficiency of approximately 60% with a misidentification rate of approximately 1%, for jets originating from light (up, down, charm, strange) quarks and gluons.",

In order to take combinatorial effects into account, a weight factor of 0.5 is applied. Since the presence of small backgrounds in the AR that contain a genuine \u03c4 h results in up to a 2% underestimation of the number of events with a misidentified \u03c4 h in the SR, a correction is applied based on the fractions of these processes in simulated events.

            "text": "A search for singly produced third-generation scalar leptoquarks, each decaying to a \u03c4 lepton and a bottom quark has been presented. The final state of an electron or a muon plus one hadronically decaying \u03c4 lepton and the final state with two hadronically decaying \u03c4 leptons are explored. In all final states at least one energetic jet identified as originating from a bottom quark is required. The search is based on a data sample of proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV recorded by the CMS detector, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 . The data are found to be in agreement with the standard model predictions. Upper limits as a function of the leptoquark mass are set on the third-generation scalar leptoquark production cross section. Results are compared with theoretical predictions to obtain lower limits on the leptoquark mass. Obs. 95% CL Figure 5. Expected and observed exclusion limits at 95% confidence level on the Yukawa coupling \u03bb at the LQ-lepton-quark vertex, as a function of the LQ mass. A unit branching fraction \u03b2 of the LQ to a \u03c4 lepton and a bottom quark is assumed. The orange vertical line indicates the limit obtained from a search for pair-produced LQs decaying to \u03c4 h bb [37]. The left-hand side of the dotted (solid) line shows the expected (observed) exclusion region for the present analysis. The gray band shows \u00b11 standard deviations of the expected exclusion limit. The region with diagonal blue shading shows the parameter space preferred by one of the models proposed to explain anomalies observed in B physics [36]. \u03bb = 1, third-generation scalar leptoquarks with mass below 740 GeV are excluded at 95% confidence level. Mass limits are also placed as a function of \u03bb. For values of \u03bb > 1.4, the mass limit obtained by this analysis exceeds that of the search considering pair production and provides the best upper limit. For \u03bb = 2.5, leptoquarks are excluded in the mass range up to 1050 GeV. This is the first time that limits have been presented in the \u03bb versus mass plane, allowing the results to be considered in the preferred parameter space of models that invoke third-generation leptoquarks to explain anomalies observed in B hadron decays. These results thus demonstrate the important potential of single leptoquark production studies to complement pair production constraints on such models, as additional data become available.",
