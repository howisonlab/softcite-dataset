The experiment uses two detectors separated by 734 km to observe a beam of neutrinos created by the Neutrinos at the Main Injector facility at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory. The data were collected in the first 282 days of beam operations and correspond to an exposure of 1:27 10 20 protons on target. Based on measurements in the Near Detector, in the absence of neutrino oscillations we expected 336 14 charged-current interactions at the Far Detector but observed 215. This deficit of events corresponds to a significance of 5.2 standard deviations. The deficit is energy dependent and is consistent with two-flavor neutrino oscillations according to jm 2 j 2:74 0:44 \u00ff0:26 10 \u00ff3 eV 2 =c 4 and sin 2 2 > 0:87 at 68% confidence level.",

There is additional and compelling evidence that = produced in the atmosphere [4 -6] and more recently by accelerators [7,8] disappear while propagating through both the atmosphere and the Earth over distances of 250 -13000 km. This behavior is consistent with threeflavor neutrino oscillations induced by mixing between nondegenerate mass eigenstates 1 , 2 , 3 and the states e , , created in weak interactions. The flavor and mass eigenstates are related by a unitary matrix U PMNS [9,10] which is typically expressed in terms of three angles 12 , 23 , 13 and a CP-violating phase . The energy and distance scales at which oscillations occur are determined by the difference in squared masses, m 2 ij m 2 i \u00ff m 2 j , of the 1 , 2 , 3 .",

[1] whereas the behavior of atmospheric and accelerator produced is determined by a much larger splitting 1:9 jm 2 atm j 3:0 10 \u00ff3 eV 2 =c 4 (90% C.L.) [11]. In this case muon-neutrino disappearance may be described as two-flavor neutrino oscillations: P ! 1 \u00ff sin 2 2sin 2 1:27 m 2 eV 2 Lkm EGeV (1) where m 2 is the effective difference of squared masses, is a mixing angle between the mass and weak eigenstates, E is the neutrino energy and L is the distance from the neutrino production point to the observation point. The analysis reported here is conducted in the two-neutrino framework, and we can tentatively identify m 2 m 2 atm m 2 32 and sin 2 2 sin 2 2 23 in the limit P ! e 0. More precisely, the experiment measures m 2 sin 2 12 m 2 31 cos 2 12 m 2 32 where effects of order sin 2 13 have been neglected [12].",

NuMI is able to provide a range of neutrino energies but has mostly been operated in the ''low-energy'' (LE10/185kA of Table I) configuration, which maximizes the neutrino flux at E 3 GeV. Neutrinos are observed by two functionally identical detectors, located at two sites, the Near Detector (ND) at FNAL and the Far Detector (FD) in the Soudan Underground Laboratory in Minnesota. The detectors are separated by 734 km and are designed to detect muon-neutrino charged-current interactions for 1 < E < 100 GeV. The characteristic L=E 245 km=GeV allows MINOS to rigorously test the oscillation hypothesis and make precision measurements of the m 2 and sin 2 2 mixing parameters governing muon-neutrino disappearance at the atmospheric neutrino mass-scale.",

            "text": "MINOS employs two detectors to significantly reduce the effect that systematic uncertainties associated with the neutrino flux, cross sections and detector efficiency have upon the disappearance measurement. Data collected by the Near Detector in several different configurations of the NuMI beam (Table I and Fig. 2) were used to constrain the simulation of the neutrino flux and the detector response to neutrino interactions. Four independent analyses were used to predict the energy spectrum expected at the Far Detector for the case that do not disappear. The analyses were fully developed using Near Detector data only. After we were satisfied with the procedure, the energy spectrum measured at the Far Detector was inspected and then compared to the predictions; oscillations cause an energy dependent suppression of the charged-current rate. A fit to the Far Detector data was performed by incorporating Eq. (1) into the Far Detector prediction. The fit also included the most significant sources of systematic uncertainty and resulted in a measurement of the oscillation parameters.",

Four methods for predicting the Far Detector charged-current spectrum in the absence of oscillations are discussed in Sec. VI. We conclude in Sec.

A schematic diagram of the NuMI beam line is shown in Fig. 1. Protons of 120 GeV=c momentum are extracted from the main injector (MI) accelerator in a 10 s spill, bent downward by 58 mrad to point at the Far Detector, and impinged upon the NuMI hadron production target. Positioned downstream of the target, two toroidal magnets called ''horns'' sign-select and focus the secondary mesons from the target, as shown in Fig. 2. The mesons are directed into a 675 m long evacuated volume, where they may decay to muons and neutrinos. At the end of the decay volume, a beam absorber stops the remnant hadrons. The absorber is followed by approximately 240 m of unexcavated rock which stops the tertiary muons, leav-TABLE I. Beam configurations and data sets used in this publication. The target position refers to the distance the target was displaced upstream of its default position inside the first focusing horn. The peak (i.e., most probable) neutrino energy E is determined after multiplying the muon-neutrino flux predicted by the beam Monte Carlo simulation by the charged-current cross section. The r.m.s. refers to the root mean square of the peak of the neutrino energy distribution. ing only neutrinos. Figure 3 shows charged-current spectra from three configurations of the NuMI beam. The following section provides a brief overview of the beam line and instrumentation.",

Particles exiting the target are recorded and later propagated in a GEANT3 [26] simulation of the NuMI beam line. The simulation describes the magnetic focusing horns, surrounding shielding and decay pipe. The magnetic field inside the horns was modeled as a perfect 1=r toroidal field. The magnetic field in the inner conductor of the horn was calculated assuming that the current was uniformly distributed throughout the 3 mm thickness of the aluminum conductor. This assumption was motivated by the large skin depth 7:7 mm for the approximately 1 ms current pulse. The 10 -30 G magnetic field in the inner apertures of the horns was neglected, as was the approximately 1 G field in the decay pipe due to residual magnetization of the iron vessel. The GEANT-FLUKA code is used to describe hadronic interactions in the beam line and the associated production of secondary particles as well as the full particle decay chains. Decays in which a neutrino is produced are saved and later used as input for neutrino event simulation in the near and Far Detectors.",

The Far Detector, by contrast, can only be struck for very small-angle decays. By Eq. (2), the different allowed decay angles, as well as the close proximity of fast pion decays to the Near Detector, results in different energy spectra at the two detectors. These differences are conveniently characterized in terms of the far/near spectral ratio shown in Fig. 29.

The expected distortion in the ratio of the far and Near Detector spectra are smaller [see Fig. 7(b)] than the individual near or Far Detector uncertainties [ Fig. 7(a)].

Modules are combined to form scintillator planes which are then mounted on a 2.54 cm-thick steel absorber plate. The detectors are composed of a series of these steel/ scintillator planes hung vertically at a 5.94 cm pitch. The scintillator strips in successive planes are rotated by 90 to measure the three dimensional event topology. The strips were produced in an extrusion process during which a 2.0 mm-wide, 2.0 mm-deep groove was driven along each strip. The entire strip, apart from the groove, was coextruded with a 0.25 mm-thick TiO 2 doped polystyrene reflective layer. Scintillation light is collected by a 1.2 mmdiameter wavelength-shifting fiber that was glued into the groove with optical epoxy. The fiber transports the light to an optical connector located on the edge of the scintillator layer where it is transferred to a clear polystyrene fiber and routed to multianode photomultipliers, as shown in Fig. 9. Light emitting diodes are used to produce controlled pulses of light during the data-taking to track gain changes in and characterize the response of the photomultipliers and electronics [28]. The data acquisition (DAQ) [29] and timing system synchronize and continuously read out the frontend electronics. Software triggering in the DAQ provides flexible event selection and data processing.

About half of these events occur in the calorimeter region and may be fully reconstructed. The Near Detector readout electronics [31] is designed to measure neutrino interactions throughout the spill, without dead-time, and with a timing resolution that allows efficient separation of time-adjacent events. Analog to digital conversion has a floating precision with a minimum least significant bit of 1.4 fC and occurs in contiguous 18.8 ns time-intervals corresponding to the 53 MHz RF of the main injector. The electronics has two primary operating modes, ''spill-gate'' and ''dynode'', which are switched in real time. In spill-gate mode the output from every photomultiplier pixel is digitized continuously in a 13 s period starting about 1:5 s before the arrival of neutrinos at the Near Detector. In dynode mode, used for out-of-spill acquisition of cosmic rays, continuous digitization for a period of 150 ns is initiated independently for each photomultiplier when the dynode signal exceeds a programmable threshold.

Two contained vertex interactions are shown in Fig. 10. In charged-current events a W boson is exchanged between the neutrino and the target. The final state consists of a muon and hadrons from the recoil system. Neutral-current (NC) events are mediated by Z exchange and only the fraction of energy carried by the recoil system is visible in the final state. The chief goal of the reconstruction procedure is to estimate the visible energy of chargedcurrent, e charged-current, and neutral-current interactions while also providing a distilled set of quantities describing the event in order to discriminate between the three processes. As shown in Fig. 10, the strongest evidence of a charged-current event comes from the presence of a track that penetrates through several detector planes and is sufficiently distinguishable from any additional hits around the track starting point. These additional hits are associated with the hadronic shower created by the recoil system and their pulse-height may be used to estimate the shower energy. Tracks are occasionally found in neutral-current events and additional event-topological quantities are used to discriminate such events from actual charged-current events (see Sec. IVA).",

The latter includes a Rein-Sehgal [35] based treatment of neutrino-induced resonance production, charged-and neutral-current coherent pion production and a modified leading order deep-inelastic scattering (DIS) model [36] extended to improve the treatment in the transition region between DIS and resonant production. KNO scaling [37] is used to calculate the finalstate multiplicity in the DIS regime. Hadrons produced in the neutrino scattering are allowed to interact while exiting the target nucleus (''final-state interactions''). The finalstate interaction calculation incorporates pion elastic and inelastic scattering, single charge exchange and absorption [38]. The calculation is benchmarked by a comparison of   final states in d and Ne interactions as measured in the BEBC and ANL-12 ft bubble chambers [39]. Figure 18 shows the charged-current cross section as a function of neutrino energy in the laboratory frame. Based on a comparison of the model predictions to independent data, some of which [40] is shown in Fig. 18, we assign a systematic uncertainty of 3% on the normalization of the DIS (W > 1:7 GeV=c 2 ) cross section, and a 10% uncertainty in the normalization of the single-pion and quasielastic cross sections. We estimate a 20% uncertainty in the relative contribution of nonresonant states to the 1 and 2 production cross sections for W < 1:7 GeV=c 2 . This uncertainty was determined from the parameter uncertainties and variations observed in fits to both inclusive and exclusive channel data, and in fits to data in different invariant mass regions. Final-state interactions are expected to have a significant effect on the visible energy of the hadronic final state [41]. In particular there are significant uncertainties in the rate of pion absorption, the mechanism for transferring the pion's energy to a nucleon cluster, and the amount of energy eventually visible to the detector. We account for these uncertainties by studying the shift in the reconstructed shower energy when we turn the simulation of final-state interactions off, and when we modify the simulation so that all of an absorbed pion's energy is lost. We find that the predicted response to hadronic showers changes by approximately 10% [41] in these two extreme cases and use this as a conservative estimate of the uncertainty on the absolute hadronic energy scale.",

The simulation randomly samples neutrinos from the flux predicted by the beam simulation (Sec. II B) and traces them through the near and Far Detector halls. Events are generated inside the detectors as well as in the surrounding support structure and rock. The simulation includes a detailed geometric model of the detector which describes the material crossed by neutrinos and neutrino-induced tracks to within 1% plane-to-plane and 0.3% averaged over the detector. The position of individual scintillator strips was determined with a precision of approximately 1 mm using cosmic ray tracks. The magnetic field is modeled via finite element analysis driven by bench measurements of the steel B-H curve. Since performing this analysis we have recalibrated our field and found that it increased by 12.3% and 9.2% averaged over the fiducial volumes in the near and Far Detectors, respectively. This recalibrated field shifts the momentum scale for muons exiting the Near Detector by approximately 6.2% (4.6% in the Far Detector) but does not significantly affect the scale for muons which stop in the detector. The detector response simulation has been tuned by directly incorporating the channel-by-channel calibration constants determined by the detector calibration procedure (see Sec. III F below). Additional data, measured in preinstallation tests, were used to constrain details of the scintillator and photomultiplier response models. The simulation has been benchmarked against through-going and stopping cosmic rays in the near and Far Detectors, beam neutrino events in the Near Detector, as well as a series of test-beam measurements [42 -45] collected with a scaled down version of the MINOS detectors in the CERN PS East Hall. The test-beam measurements are used to fix the energy scale and validate the simulation of electromagnetic and hadronic showers. The hadronic shower code GCALOR [46] was found to be in relatively good agreement with the data (see Sec. III F) and is used in our simulations.",

This level of agreement is inclusive of energy dependent offsets in the beam momentum of the test beam lines and uncertainties in the simulation of energy loss upstream of the calibration detector. In light of the much larger uncertainty associated with final-state interactions, no attempt was made to resolve these discrepancies when determining the conversion from MEU to GeV for neutrino-induced showers. Instead a conservative uncertainty of 5.6% is assigned to the absolute shower energy scale to account for the data/MC discrepancies from the calibration detector as well as the precision of the stopping muon calibration performed there.

We remove neutral-current events from the oscillation sample with a technique based on the event topology. The technique uses three probability density functions (PDFs), which are constructed for the following variables: (a) the event length, expressed in units of the number of detector planes, (b) the fraction of the total event signal in the reconstructed track, and (c) the average signal per plane induced by the reconstructed track. These quantities are related to the muon-range, the event inelasticity, and the average energy loss dE=dx of the muon track and are distributed differently for charged-current and neutral-current events as shown in Fig. 21.

These values were chosen to optimize the statistical sensitivity to the oscillation parameters m 2 and sin 2 2 in the Far Detector, and to provide a selected event sample in the Near Detector that has the same purity, defined as the fraction of selected events that are true charged-current interactions, as the Far Detector. Figure 23 shows the selection efficiency, defined as the fraction of true charged-current events that have S > \u00ff0:1 in the Near Detector (S > \u00ff0:2 in the Far Detector), and the resulting purity of the sample in the two detectors. The efficiency is calculated with respect to the events passing the criteria of Sec. III D and varies slowly as a function of reconstructed energy above 0.5 GeV. The contamination from misidentified neutral-current interactions is greater at low reconstructed energy, hence the purity of the selected sample drops below 1 GeV. The Monte Carlo simulation indicates that the average selection efficiency and purity (integrated over the unoscillated Far Detector LE010/ 185kA spectrum) are 90.0% and 98.2%, respectively. The PDFs used to discriminate between chargedcurrent and neutral-current interactions depend on the energy spectrum and are therefore sensitive to neutrino oscillations. As such, the discrimination technique was developed and validated by comparing the Monte Carlo simulation to data collected in the Near Detector. A fraction of the Far Detector data set was available for data quality checks. Examination of oscillation-sensitive distributions in the full Far Detector data set was only performed after these checks had been made and we had fully defined our analysis procedure. Table II shows the effect of our selection on those Far Detector events that are recorded in coincidence with NuMI beam spills. After requiring S > \u00ff0:2 we retain 215 of the 275 events passing the criteria of Sec. III D. The variables used in Eq. (4) and (5) are shown in Fig. 24 for the 275 event sample. Two versions of the simulation are shown. The first does not account for neutrino oscillations while in the second we apply the effect of oscillations according to the mixing parameters extracted from our data using the procedure described in Sec. VII. The measured deficit of events with respect to the unoscillated simulation is consistent with the partial disappearance of charged-current events at energies less than about 10 GeV and is well described when we account for oscillations.

Second, we applied the charged-current selection criteria described above to a sample of 2:3 10 6 spill triggers taken in anticoincidence with the beam spill. Both of these methods yielded an upper limit (90% C.L) of 0.5 background events in a 10 s wide window around the time of true beam spill for an exposure of 1:27 10 20 POT. The background due to neutrino-induced charged-current interactions in the rock upstream of the Far Detector is estimated from the Monte Carlo simulation to be 0.38 events. The rate of cosmic ray muons is about 30 times larger in the Near Detector than it is in the Far Detector. The cosmic ray background is negligible, however, due to the much greater ( 10 6 ) neutrino flux at the Near Detector.

II D uncertainties in the neutrino flux calculation arise from insufficient knowledge of hadron production off the NuMI target as well as from several beam focusing effects described in Sec. II D.

This is shown in Fig. 27 for each of the beam configurations in which we collected data (see Table I). Our method works by representing the underlying production yield, d 2 N=dp z dp T , as a parametric function which we use to tune the Monte Carlo in a 2 fit to the Near Detector data. We add terms to the 2 which describe the influence that beam focusing and detector modeling uncertainties have on the spectrum [see Fig. 7(a)].

II C). The extrapolation process may then, in one approach, be viewed as making 30% 5 adjustments based on the energy spectrum measured in the Near Detector in order to predict the Far Detector spectrum. These adjustments are made, in part, by using the Monte Carlo simulation but are relative between the two detectors and are thus less sensitive to uncertainties in the absolute flux, cross sections and detector acceptance. We refer to this approach as ''direct'' extrapolation because the Near Detector data are used as measured without further constraining the simulation. In a second approach near to Far Detector extrapolation may be viewed as using the Near Detector data to constrain the Monte Carlo calculation of the neutrino flux, cross sections and detector acceptance. The improved simulation is then used to calculate the energy spectrum expected at the Far Detector. This approach is referred to as ''indirect'' extrapolation in contrast to the direct approach. In practice the two approaches are complementary and result in very similar predictions of the Far Detector spectrum. The present section describes the specific techniques that were developed to implement each approach. We have pursued a total of four techniques in order to better understand the extrapolation process and study the robustness of our oscillation measurement.",

The energy dependence in the ratio comes from two main sources [58,59]. First, the solid angle acceptance of the Near Detector varies as a function of the distance from the neutrino production point while the acceptance of the Far Detector is essentially constant. The two detectors subtend different solid angles and by Eq. (3) observe different neutrino angle distributions which, according to Eq. (2), result in different neutrino energy distributions. Apertures in the beam line (for example, the decay pipe) and under or over focusing in the horns enhance this effect by attenuating pions in certain energy ranges and locations along the beam line. According to Eq. (2), this introduces an energy dependent suppression of the neutrino flux which, because of the disparate angular acceptance, is not the same in the two detectors. Second, neutrinos produced by decays at finite radii from the beam axis will cover different angular ranges when intersecting the fiducial volumes of the near and Far Detectors. This effect also introduces different energy distributions in the two detectors. These effects cause the peaks and dips in Fig. 29. Thus, the major sources of relative near to far differences in the neutrino flux (and hence, energy spectrum) are largely due to beam line geometry, focusing, angular acceptance and decay kinematics. This suggests that the Monte Carlo simulation may be used, with relatively small uncertainties, to derive a transfer function that extrapolates the neutrino energy spectrum measured in the Near Detector to the Far Detector.",

Black points show the ratio of reconstructed energy spectra at the Far Detector, where the denominator corresponds to the nominal simulation and the numerator was generated with a particular systematic uncertainty source shifted with respect to the default value. Deviations from unity indicate the way in which the systematic uncertainties modify the neutrino energy spectrum. The size of the deviations does not necessarily indicate the potential effect on m 2 and sin 2 2 because the extrapolation methods use similarly shifted Near Detector Monte Carlo samples as ''mock data.''

The deviation of this quantity between data and simulation was approximately 2%, which was taken as an estimate of the uncertainty on the magnetic field calibration in the Near Detector, and hence the error on the relative muon energy scale between near and Far Detectors.

In particular, discrepancies of 5% are present when data collected in the LE10/185kA beam configuration are compared with the Monte Carlo prediction after the best-fit NDFit and 2DFit systematic parameters have been applied. We also notice that somewhat larger discrepancies are still present in the LE100/200kA beam configuration.

These parameters are the relative normalization between the far and Near Detectors, with a 4% uncertainty; the absolute hadronic energy scale with a 11% uncertainty, and a 50% uncertainty in the neutral-current background rate for the selected sample. Since the energy scale and neutral-current background uncertainties are common to the two detectors, their effect significantly cancels in the extrapolation of the energy spectrum from the near to the Far Detector. In order to account for this in the fit, these parameters are varied simultaneously for both near and Far Detectors, and the Monte Carlo reconstructed energy distributions are modified accordingly. A new Far Detector predicted spectrum is then obtained for every value of these systematic parameters as they are varied in the oscillation fit. Figure 36(a) shows the reconstructed neutrino energy spectrum measured at the Far Detector, the unoscillated Far Detector predicted spectrum obtained from the beam matrix method, along with the predicted spectrum weighted by the best-fit oscillation parameters. Figure 36(b) shows the ratio of data to the unoscillated Monte Carlo prediction as a function of reconstructed energy, and the predicted ratio for the best-fit oscillation parameters.

The data were collected over a nine month period from May 2005 to February 2006, corresponding to a total of 1:27 10 20 protons on target. The experiment uses two detectors separated by 734 km. The prediction of the unoscillated neutrino flux at the Far Detector site was obtained from the observed neutrino spectrum at the Near Detector location. This two-detector approach provides significant cancellation of systematic errors due to uncertainties in beam modeling and neutrino cross sections. In addition, we used Near Detector data taken with several beam configurations in order to constrain some of these uncertainties.",
