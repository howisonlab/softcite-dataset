In contrast to light quarks, heavy quark states are narrow and do not mix with the states of other quarks. This is illustrated in Fig. 1(left) for charmonium. Also, the effective coupling constant and relativistic problems are far more tractable. Thus, the spectra of charmonium and bottomonium are easier to characterize and study.",

The bb bottomonium system is, in principle, the best one to study the fundamental aspects of the hyperfine interaction between quarks. Unfortunately, until last year we had no knowledge of the hyperfine interaction between b-quarks. The spin-triplet \u03a5(1 3 S 1 ) state of bottomonium was discovered in 1977, but its partner, the spin-singlet \u03b7 b (1 1 S 0 ) ground state of bottomonium, was not identified for thirty years, mainly because of the difficulty in observing weak M1 radiative transitions. There were many pQCD based theoretical predictions which varied all over the map, This has changed now. The \u03b7 b (1 1 S 0 ) ground state of the bb Upsilon family has been finally identified! In July 2008, BaBar announced the identification of \u03b7 b [7]. They analyzed the inclusive photon spectrum of in their data for 120 million \u03a5(3S ) (28 fb \u22121 e + e \u2212 ).

We make very detailed analysis of the large continuum background under the resonance photon peaks. We determine photon peak shapes by analyzing background from peaks in background-free radiative Bhabhas and in exclusive \u03c7 b1 decays. And we make a joint fit of the full data in three bins of | cos \u03b8 T |, covering the full range | cos \u03b8 T | = 0 \u2212 1.0 (see Fig. 5).
