Inevitably, the complexity of strong-interaction phenomena requires the use of a large variety of theoretical techniques-from perturbative cross-section calculations up to the modelling of exclusive hadronic final states. Together with the unprecedented precision of the data provided by the experiments in the first running period of the LHC, a solid foundation of hadron-hadron collision physics at the TeV scale could be established that allowed the discovery of the Higgs boson and that is vital for estimating the background in searches for new phenomena. This chapter on studies of quantum chromodynamics at the LHC is part of a recent book on the results of LHC Run 1 [1] and presents the advances in theoretical methods side-by-side with related key measurements in an integrated approach.",

Like the electromagnetic and the weak force, QCD belongs to the class of gauge field theories. The assumption that the corresponding gauge symmetry is an exact symmetry of nature results in truly massless force carriers of the strong force, the gluons. However, as a consequence of the non-Abelian character of the SU(3) QCD gauge group, the gluons carry a strong or so-called \"colour\" charge and interact amongst themselves. This is a striking difference to the electromagnetic force, which is mediated by electrically uncharged photons, and it induces-amongst other effects-the confinement of strongly interacting particles at low energies. In the following, the colour-charged constituents of hadrons, i.e. quarks, antiquarks, and gluons, will generically be denoted as \"partons\".",

Despite complications through the gluon self-interactions, the perturbative expansion of QCD (pQCD) that describes interactions with large momentum exchanges (\"hard interactions\") in terms of parton-parton scatterings remains the most powerful theoretical technique. This technique allows quantitative predictions at parton level for observables ranging from inclusive production rates to shape observables, which are sensitive to details of the QCD radiation pattern. Nevertheless the theory's confining nature obliges us to address non-perturbative aspects. This includes a reliable understanding of the short-distance parton structure of the initial-state protons, the fragmentation of final-state partons into hadrons, or the modelling of soft proton interactions.",

For high scales Q, QCD becomes almost a free theory-a property known as \"asymptotic freedom\". It is this weakly coupled regime where perturbative methods can successfully be applied and quantitative predictions for hard scattering processes can be made.

Merely the proton remnants, which fragment into hadrons along the beam lines, have to be described by non-perturbative models in MC event generators.

Here, \"measurable\" refers to colour-neutral particles with mean decay lengths such that c\u03c4 > 10 mm, where c is the speed of light and \u03c4 the lifetime of a particle. One possibility to account for this transition is to reuse the concept underlying the PDFs that describe the partonic content of a hadron, only in an inverted sense. The necessary functions D k\u2192h (z, \u00b5 F ) are called fragmentation functions (FFs) and are the final-state analogues of the PDFs. They parametrise the probability of finding a hadron h within the fragmentation products of parton k, carrying the fraction z of the parton momentum. Like the PDFs, fragmentation functions depend on a non-physical resolution or fragmentation scale \u00b5 F . Again, these functions can currently not be determined by first principles in QCD, but once they have been measured (for example under the experimentally more favourable conditions of e + e \u2212 collisions at the LEP collider), they are universally valid.",

Instead of looking into the detailed production of identified particles-an experimentally very challenging endeavour-for the majority of processes it is sufficient to know how much energy and momentum is carried away by hadrons. QCD predicts that large-distance non-perturbative (NP) effects are mostly decoupled from the hard reaction so that highly energetic partons fragment into a collimated stream or \"jet\" of hadrons, which inherits energy and momentum from its parent parton. To define what \"collimated\" means, a prescription is required that, given some distance measure, unambiguously decides which objects belong to a jet. As one wants to compare predictions by pQCD with measured particles, tracks, or energy depositions as illustrated in figure 2, a jet algorithm is needed that is applicable to theoretical calculations as well as to measurements from different experiments.",

While the LO, i.e. one-loop, approximation is quoted here, the QCD splitting functions are known up-to NNLO, i.e. three-loop accuracy [40,41]. The LO DGLAP evolution allows for a interpretation by means of simple branching processes. A parton i resolved at scale \u00b5 F may have originated from a branching of parton j resolved at some higher scale. This transition of parton j to i is accompanied by the emission of an additional QCD parton. When applying the DGLAP equations to solve for the scale evolution of PDFs or FFs, these emitted particles get ignored, by considering inclusive processes only. However, in parton-shower MC programs these emissions are made explicit, and the subsequent branching of initial-state and final-state partons results in a cascade-like picture, modelling the initial-\u03b2 \u03b2  and final-state evolution of the hard process' parton configuration into an ensemble of many QCD partons. In essence these parton-shower emissions approximate higher-order real-emission corrections to the hard scattering process. Shower simulations form an integral part of MC event generators-simulation tools to describe the fully exclusive hadronic final states of individual scattering events [42]. They link the hard scattering at some high scale Q 2 to an exclusive set of partons with typical separation scales of order Q 2 0 \u2248 1 GeV 2 , the cut-off scale of the shower evolution. Through this parton-shower link it is possible to invoke universal models for the hadronisation of partons into hadrons, independent of the hard process scale Q 2 . Physically, parton showers account for the intra-jet evolution of jets by accounting for the emission of almost collinear partons, and they model the inter-jet QCD activity through the emission of soft, wide-angle partons.",

In contrast to collinear emissions, which factorise at the cross-section level, soft-gluon emissions factorise at the level of individual QCD amplitudes. One should therefore consider soft gluons to be emitted by the scattering process as a whole, given by the squared sum of all contributing amplitudes. At first glance this approach seems to spoil the parton-shower picture of independent subsequent emissions. However, soft colourcoherence effects originating from the interference of individual amplitudes can be incorporated into parton-shower simulations by suitable choices for the shower-evolution variable. Most prominently this can be achieved by using the emission's opening angle as ordering parameter, as employed in the Herwig and Herwig++ generators [43,44].",

The production of single inclusive jets and of dijets constitute the most basic QCD processes at hadron colliders. Figure 6 shows a comparison between data and theory at NLO, i.e. O(c 1 \u03b1 2 s + c 2 \u03b1 3 s ), for (a) inclusive jets from CMS [32] and (b) dijets from ATLAS [98], both at 7 TeV centre-of-mass energy. Recently, also trijet cross sections were measured [99,100]. The inclusive jet cross section has been measured as a function of p jet T and y in ranges of 0.1 \u2264 p T < 2.0 TeV and |y| < 2.5 (see Refs. [32,33]). The dijet cross section is presented as a function of the dijet mass, m 12 , and rapidity separation, y * = |y 1 \u2212 y 2 |/2, of the two highest-p T jets in regions of 0.3 \u2264 m 12 < 5.0 TeV and y * < 3.0, respectively. In both cases the NLO theory has been corrected for non-perturbative effects, and for the more recent ATLAS publication also electroweak (EW) corrections have been considered. While EW effects start being sizeable at high p jet",

Many choices are possible in terms of data set selection, theoretical ingredients and approximations, parameterisation, or fitting techniques and criteria. There is no unique approach to PDF fits. The PDF sets in use at the LHC are produced by six PDF fitting groups: ABM, CTEQ, (G)JR, HERAPDF, MSTW, and NNPDF [102][103][104][105][106][107], where the quoted publications refer to pre-LHC determinations. The fundamental experimental input central to all PDF determinations are deep-inelastic scattering (DIS) data collected by the H1 and ZEUS collaborations at the ep collider HERA. The HERA collaborations' own PDF fits based solely on their data are presented as HERAPDF sets. The ABM group extends the choice of data to other DIS measurements and fixed-target Drell-Yan data, while the (G)JR group also considers high-p T jet production, which cannot yet be described at NNLO, to better fix the gluon PDF. The trio of CTEQ, MSTW, and NNPDF finally try to incorporate as many data sets as possible and to provide truly global fits. New PDF sets including LHC data became available recently or are in preparation for the next start-up of the LHC with 13 TeV center-of-mass energy.",

The technique of \"Bayesian reweighting\" was first implemented in the context of the NNPDF approach [108]. The NNPDF collaboration [109] provides PDF sets in the form of an ensemble of replicas, which sample variations in the PDF parameter space within allowed uncertainties. Their method fits a PDF to smeared data points, where each data point is sampled from a multi-Gaussian distribution. The central value of the distribution is equal to the measurement point and the covariance is taken from the experimental uncertainties. This procedure is repeated N times and provides an ensemble of N PDFs representing the uncertainty of the PDF fit. Hence, the NNPDF prediction for an observable is given by the mean and standard deviation as estimators for the true value and its uncertainty. Via the Bayesian reweighting, the impact of new data can be approximately taken into account by giving according weights different from unity to each replica. If this leads to many replicas with zero or very small weights, this technique cannot be applied and refits must be performed. Otherwise the re-evaluation of an observable while using the re-weighted set of replicas approximately accounts for changes in the PDFs due to the additional data.",

As can be seen from figure 7 and the DGLAP equations (5), the appearance of gluons and the strength of \u03b1 s (Q) are coupled. Therefore, a simultaneous fit of PDFs and \u03b1 s (M Z ) with DIS data alone is not possible, which is also the reason why the value of \u03b1 s (M Z ) is fixed in the above-mentioned PDF fit of Ref. [105]. The inclusion of jet data facilitates such a simultaneous fit of PDFs and the strong coupling as demonstrated by CMS [110]. In the following, the focus shall be, however, on the running behaviour of \u03b1 s (Q) according to equation 3. To eliminate or reduce numerous experimental sources of uncertainty-such as those related to the luminosity measurement or the jet energy scaleagain a ratio is used: that of the inclusive 3-jet over the inclusive 2-jet production cross section, R 32 . In this quantity, also theoretical uncertainties like those stemming from the PDFs are reduced. Since 3-jet production requires one real emission more than the usual dijets, the numerator is approximately proportional to \u03b1 3 s , while the denominator is \u221d \u03b1 2 s . R 32 is therefore a direct measure for the strength of the strong coupling. The CMS collaboration has investigated this ratio with the result \u03b1 s (M Z ) = 0.1148 \u00b1 0.0014 (exp) \u00b1 0.0018(PDF) \u00b1 0.0050(theo) [119]. By performing the analysis separately for different regions of the average p T of the two leading jets, the running could be tested up to scales of 1.39 TeV. Figure 9(a) shows the ratio R 32 measured by CMS in comparison to predictions at NLO obtained with the CT10 PDF set for a series of assumptions on \u03b1 s (M Z ).  ",

Similar to what was discussed for the treatment of infrared singularities appearing in NLO corrections before, there exist now several subtraction schemes to handle these divergences consistently [120][121][122][123].",

For the NNLO evaluation of dijet production, results have been achieved for two-gluon final states, initiated by gluon annihilation [140], and for quark-antiquark initial states [141]. For the inclusive jet cross section at \u221a s = 8 TeV, considering anti-k t jets with R = 0.7, transverse jet momenta of p T > 80 GeV and jet rapidities |y| < 4.4, the authors find an increase of the NNLO prediction with respect to the NLO estimate of about 27-16%. The corrections are largest for small jet transverse momenta and decrease for larger values of jet p T . The given calculation relies on the MSTW08-NNLO PDF set [106] and uses a dynamical scale choice of \u00b5 = \u00b5 R = \u00b5 F equal to the transverse momentum of the leading jet. The size of these corrections highlights the importance of higher-order calculations for LHC precision observables. In what follows, two standard \"candles\" (i.e. well-measured processes or processes with theoretically well-understood cross sections) at the LHC-the Drell-Yan processes and diphoton production-shall be discussed in some more detail.",

The high-p T part of the spectrum can be modelled by perturbative QCD calculations considering processes with additional jets (W/Z + n-jet processes). Presently calculations can be performed with up to n = 5 additional partons. When the transverse momentum of the vector boson is much smaller than its invariant mass reconstructed from the two leptons, soft QCD radiation is enhanced and fixed-order perturbation theory has to be supplemented by the resummation of large logarithmic corrections of the form \u03b1 n s ln m (p T /M ) to all orders of \u03b1 s . The resummed cross sections also include a non-perturbative component at momentum scales below 1 GeV.

Indeed, this process dominates for inclusive Z production within a rapidity range of |y| < 2.1. However, already for Z transverse momenta around 25 GeV quark-gluon scattering qg \u2192 Zq is of similar size, and around p T = 100 GeV the latter process constitutes 80% of the total cross section [157]. For Z-boson transverse momenta of 180 GeV, parton-momentum fractions x 1/2 = (M/ \u221a s) exp(\u00b1y) of about x = 0.05 are probed. The program ResBos [158] implements soft-gluon resummation at low p T at next-to-next-to-leadinglogarithm (NNLL) accuracy and matches to a matrix-element calculation of order O(\u03b1 2 s ) at high p T . It provides fully differential cross sections as a function of the rapidity, the invariant mass and the transverse momentum of the vector boson. It also attempts to estimate non-perturbative corrections [159]. Recently, first calculations for Drell-Yan lepton-pair production at NNLO accuracy including parton-shower effects have been presented [160,161].  Figure 11 shows the comparison of the data to the NNLO QCD predictions based on Dynnlo [126] and Fewz [143,144] using the CT10 PDF set. Shown as a band are theory uncertainties that are due to the renormalisation-scale and factorisation-scale variations and associated with the choice of PDFs for both calculations. The measurement uncertainties are below a percent in most bins and are smaller than the theory uncertainties that reach 10% around 50 GeV. The two calculations are in excellent agreement with each other for p T < 100 GeV, but differ at large p T by about 10%. In the region 10 < p T < 100 GeV the predictions are 10% lower than the data. For p T < 10 GeV the fixed-order calculations diverge and clearly disagree with the data.",

However, in contrast to the massive vector bosons W and Z, which are predominantly produced in hard scattering processes and can easily be identified via their leptonic decay modes, massless photons can also be radiated off initial-state or final-state partons or may be created in decays. In particular the \u03c0 0 and \u03b7 mesons, and to some extent also the \u03c9, all of which are copiously produced within jets, have neutral decay modes. Since these particles are boosted within the jets, their decay photons are collimated and difficult to distinguish from a single highly energetic photon.

The effect of the above-mentioned isolation conditions, which aim to suppress fragmentation photons in favour of direct ones, have to be properly estimated not only experimentally for mesons decaying within jets, but also theoretically, e.g. via FFs in the perturbative calculations. The NLO parton-level program Res-Bos [179,180] effectively includes the fragmentation of one quark/gluon to a single photon at leading order and additionally features soft and collinear gluon resummation (see section 8). Diphox [178] provides parton-level results at NLO taking fully into account up to two fragmentation photons. Although formally an NNLO box graph, the process (gg \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3) is drastically enhanced at the LHC through the large gluon luminosity. It is comparable in size to the LO terms, and therefore Diphox includes this contribution at NLO precision, i.e. up to N 3 LO corrections in the strong coupling \u03b1 s , via Gamma2mc [181].",

            "text": "Finally, a full NNLO calculation is available in the form of the 2\u03b3NNLO [130] program, however without consideration of fragmentation photons. Four kinematic variables are usually chosen to investigate the differential photon-pair production cross section: the invariant mass m \u03b3\u03b3 , the transverse momentum of the photon pair p T,\u03b3\u03b3 , the azimuthal angular separation \u2206\u03c6 \u03b3\u03b3 , and the cosine of the polar angle in the Collins-Soper reference frame [182] of the diphoton system, cos \u03b8 * \u03b3\u03b3 . The invariant mass is of obvious interest for resonance searches, where cos \u03b8 * \u03b3\u03b3 is useful to examine the spin of diphoton resonances. The transverse momentum p T,\u03b3\u03b3 and the quantity \u2206\u03c6 \u03b3\u03b3 are well-suited for the comparison of specific aspects of the theoretically very challenging description of photon-pair production. In particular, at low p T,\u03b3\u03b3 or for well-balanced photons at \u2206\u03c6 \u03b3\u03b3 \u2248 \u03c0, where multiple soft-gluon emission becomes important, fixed-order calculations are not expected to work. As an example, figure 12 shows a comparison between data and parton-shower improved LO predictions by Pythia6 and Sherpa for p T,\u03b3\u03b3 and \u2206\u03c6 \u03b3\u03b3 from ATLAS [172]. Since both MC event generators fail to accurately predict the total cross section, the distributions have been rescaled by a factor of 1.2 to match the total cross section in data. In both cases Sherpa provides a good description of the whole distribution, while Pythia6 exhibits some discrepancy at low p T,\u03b3\u03b3 . Figure 13(a) furthermore presents comparisons for the cross section differential in \u2206\u03c6 \u03b3\u03b3 for Sherpa and to NLO from ResBos including soft-gluon resummation. Again Sherpa gives a good overall description, while ResBos predictions are too low by factors of 2-3 at small separation angles. A similar behaviour can be seen in the comparison to NLO from Diphox + Gamma2mc in figure 13(b), although due to resummation ResBos performs somewhat better around \u2206\u03c6 \u03b3\u03b3 \u2248 \u03c0. The best description of the data is given by the NNLO result from 2\u03b3NNLO ( figure 13(b)), even though the fragmentation contribution is not included. ATLAS observes similar results when comparing their data to the predictions from Diphox + Gamma2mc and 2\u03b3NNLO [172].",

Accordingly, the real-emission correction as part of the fixed-order calculation has to be properly synchronised with the first, i.e. hardest, shower splitting. Furthermore, the NLO accuracy with respect to the inclusive production process considered needs to be preserved. Two basic solutions exist to this problem, which are known as MC@NLO [190] and Powheg [191]. Over the last years there has been tremendous development in implementing these techniques for a wide range of processes and ultimately their automation, see Refs. [74,[192][193][194][195].",

Presently, many experimental analyses are in a transition phase adopting NLO matrix-element calculations plus parton showers as baseline for MC event generation instead of the former LO based ones (see Section 5). Figure 14 shows the W +jets cross section as a function of the leading-jet p T as measured by CMS [203] and ATLAS [204] using proton-proton collision data recorded at \u221a s = 7 TeV. In the ATLAS measurement, jets are defined by the anti-k t jet algorithm using a radius parameter of R = 0.4 and measured within 30 \u2264 p T < 300 GeV and |y| < 4.4. The results for up to four additional jets are superimposed and are compared to the predictions of Sherpa and Alpgen. The measured shape of the jet p T distribution is described by the Monte Carlo simulation within the uncertainties. In the CMS measurement, jets defined by the anti-k t jet algorithm with R = 0.5 are selected with p T > 30 GeV and |y| < 2.4. The jet spectrum reaches up to p T values of 800 GeV. The data fall below the leading-order QCD predictions towards high p T .

This indicates that the fraction /dp of events exhibiting a second jet increases considerably with the p T of the leading jet and that the parton shower approximation, which is used by MC@NLO for the second jet, fails to describe the data. The results are also compared to two multi-leg Monte Carlo simulations produced with up to five additional partons. The Alpgen simulation overestimates the data at high p T for the leading jets and underestimates the data for the fourth-leading jets. Sherpa is in good agreement with the data considering the experimental uncertainties. The measurements of the Z+jets cross section are limited by the experimental uncertainty on the jet energy measurements. By considering jet-multiplicity ratios, many experimental and theoretical uncertainties cancel, allowing for an even more precise data-to-theory comparison.",

An earlier measurement was performed by the CMS experiment on a smaller data set [208]. Figure 16 shows the ratio R (N +1)/N for successive exclusive jet multiplicities for all events (\"inclusive\") and for events with at least one jet with p T > 150 GeV. For the inclusive case, the ratio shows a rather flat, approximately linear dependence on the jet multiplicity with a small slope only, while for events with p T > 150 GeV the measured distribution steeply rises towards low jet multiplicities. These measurements illustrate two limiting cases of scaling patterns, the \"staircase scaling\" [209] with R (N +1)/N constant and the \"Poisson scaling\" [210] with R (N +1)/N = N /N , where N is the average number of jets. These scaling patterns can be qualitatively understood from the expected Poisson-distributed jet multiplicity. For large jet-p T differences, the Poisson-scaling is directly observed (see figure 16(b)). However, for low p T and small N jet , the emission of additional partons is suppressed by the PDFs, and for high N jet the emission of additional partons no longer follows a Poisson distribution due to the non-Abelian nature of QCD, leading to a proliferation of the number of jets originating from gluon splitting (see figure 16(a)).",

The scale uncertainty is only shown for the NLO QCD calculation based on BlackHat-Sherpa. The different grey shades indicate the scale uncertainty when it is considered uncorrelated (as proposed in Ref. [211]) or correlated across the various jet multiplicities. Assuming the predicted and now observed scaling patterns to be valid, it becomes possible to give estimates for even higher jet multiplicities where there exists no complete NLO prediction yet [212]. The predictions of processes with heavy-flavour content are more difficult to accomplish than those for the inclusive case. Bottom (b) quarks are significantly heavier than the proton, and in strong interactions at high scales they can only be created in pairs. The calculations can be classified in two types: In the 4-flavour (4F) scheme heavy quarks appear only in the final state and are typically considered massive, while 5-flavour (5F) scheme calculations include heavy quarks in the initial state, i.e. as present in the proton. For this purpose, c-quark and b-quark PDFs are used.",

            "text": "When discussing the process of vector-boson production before, the necessity to incorporate effects of multiple emissions of initial-state and final-state partons to appropriately model certain observables has been touched upon already. In fact, phase-space regions sensitive to the emission of soft and/or collinear QCD quanta often resist a satisfactory description in terms of fixed-order perturbation theory. Rather, one is forced to identify the relevant enhanced contributions, namely large logarithmic terms, and to reorganise the perturbative expansion for the observable at hand. The aim is to account for the enhanced terms to all orders in perturbation theory. This procedure is referred to as \"resummation\" and allows an appropriate treatment in a wide range of perturbative QCD phenomena.",

Furthermore, resummation techniques become important when the real-emission phase space is constrained, leaving behind finite but possibly large uncancelled QCD corrections. Examples thereof are observables that exhibit thresholds [236][237][238][239] or that rely on an explicit veto on QCD activity [240][241][242][243][244]. Resummed expressions for this type of observables might enable us to extract QCD parameters such as the strong coupling, quark masses and the parton distribution functions much more accurately than when having to rely on fixed-order perturbation theory alone. In the following, two concrete examples shall be considered: the application of a veto on additional jet activity and the jet-mass distribution in Z+jet production.",

For this class of observables, used also to select the weak-boson-fusion production channel of Higgs bosons (see Chap. 6 of Ref. [1]), one considers a specific kinematic structure of two hard and widely separated jets. Analysing the QCD activity inbetween these hard jets, events are vetoed in case there are additional jets with transverse momentum above a certain veto scale Q 0 , filtering out those events that exhibit a gap between the two boundary jets. On the one hand, the presence of the potentially soft jet-veto scale Q 0 induces large logarithms with argument Q/Q 0 , where Q denotes the typical hard process scale, e.g. the boundary jets' transverse momenta. This demands for the all-orders treatment of wide-angle soft-gluon radiation [240,241]. On the other hand, when considering large rapidity separations \u2206y between the boundary jets, manifestations of BFKL-like dynamics [245,246] are expected, requiring to sum terms proportional to \u03b1 n s (\u2206y) n to all orders n [247,248]. In Refs. [249,250] ATLAS presented measurements of dijet production with a veto on additional jets. In order to gain further insight into the QCD dynamics determining the gapfraction and gap-jet measurements, Ref. [250] considers additional azimuthal-decorrelation observables. In this latter analysis, the data are compared to predictions from Powheg [193,251], interfaced to the Pythia8 and Herwig event generators, as well as to the program Hej [252] with and without invoking the Ariadne shower model [253]. The two Powheg simulations provide NLO accuracy for the inclusive dijet production process invoking leading-logarithmic DGLAP resummation through the parton showers attached. The Hej approach provides a resummation of small-x, BFKL-type logarithmic terms that can be supplemented with DGLAP resummation through, in this case, the Ariadne parton cascade.",

The fraction of events exhibiting a rapidity gap decreases as the veto scale is lowered or when increasing \u2206y. This corresponds to the expectation of an increase of the jet activity when considering lower jet transverse-momentum thresholds together with the rise in jet multiplicity when considering larger rapidity intervals. The Powheg +Pythia8 prediction yields a reasonable description of the data. Employing the Herwig parton shower the agreement worsens, an effect that originates from a prediction of too many jets above the veto scale. For the two predictions from Hej the agreement with data improves when considering large rapidity separations. Given the high precision of the measured data, no single theoretical prediction is capable of describing the data in all phase-space regions. Considering more observables, including angular variables, Ref. [250] establishes the DGLAP-based Powheg +Pythia8 and BFKL-like Hej +Ariadne simulations to yield the best overall description of the data. So far no clear-cut statements about the evidence for BFKL effects can be established. However, the small experimental uncertainties allow theoretical models for QCD radiation between widely separated and high-transverse momentum jets to be further constrained and improved [210,[254][255][256][257].",

The successful application of jet-substructure methods requires a more detailed and even finer understanding and modelling of the inner structure of QCD jets. The new experimental challenges to address include the consideration of various jet algorithms and radii that need to be calibrated, the quantification and possible removal of non-perturbative contributions from underlying event or pile-up activity, or the application of tracking and flavour-tagging methods in busy environments. On the theoretical side, precise and reliable predictions for the new observables at hand are required. This, in particular, asks for resummed calculations, in the form of Monte Carlo parton-shower simulations or as dedicated analytical results.",

            "text": "ATLAS and CMS have presented several analyses that address these questions and compare their data to theoretical models [55-58, [262][263][264][265]. One particular and rather simple observable shall be considered as an example here: the invariant mass of jets-the jet-mass distribution. The jet-mass variable probes the composition of jet objects and thus depends on the production process, the jet algorithm and its parameters used to cluster the jets, and on additional selection or filtering steps applied to the final states. The aim of \"jet grooming\" procedures is to reduce the impact of underlying-event and pile-up contributions on the jet properties and sometimes also to remove certain types of intra-jet parton splittings, all that in order to maximise the sensitivity to the desired signal. Examples of jet-grooming procedures include trimming [266], pruning [261], mass-drop [267,268] or soft-drop [269] filtering. Dedicated theoretical predictions for the jet-mass distribution exist for a variety of production processes, including dijet final states, vector-boson plus jet production and Higgs-boson plus jet production [270][271][272][273]. The mass distribution of QCD jets after the application of grooming techniques has recently been discussed in Refs. [274,275]. In Ref. [262] the CMS collaboration has presented an analysis of the jet-mass observable in dijet and W/Z+jet events, focusing on the effects of various grooming techniques and comparing data to parton-shower Monte Carlo predictions. For an integrated luminosity of 5 fb \u22121 of 7 TeV collision data they considered both the anti-k t and Cambridge-Aachen [276][277][278] jet algorithms using various distance parameters, namely R = 0.7 for anti-k t and R = 0.8 and R = 1.2 for Cambridge-Aachen. The groomed and ungroomed data are compared to Monte Carlo predictions from Pythia6 and Herwig++. As an example, the unfolded jet-mass distribution of Z( )+jet events is shown in figure 19. Depicted there is the jet-mass variable for anti-k t jets after a pruning procedure, analysed for four slices in jet transverse momentum (note the arbitrary scaling factors). For all the jet-p T slices both generators describe the data well. A similar level of congruence is observed for the alternative grooming techniques and combinations of jet algorithm and distance parameter. Somewhat larger deviations between data and Monte Carlo estimates are observed for regions of small jet mass. However, it is in particular this region of phase space that is most affected by non-perturbative corrections from pile-up, underlying event and hadronisation. Attempts to analytically estimate the effects of the underlying event and parton-to-hadron fragmentation on the jet-mass distribution have been presented in Ref. [279].",

            "text": "Perturbatively, the internal structure of jets is determined by multiple emissions of gluons and depends on the type of initiating parton, i.e. a quark or gluon. Perturbative QCD predicts that gluon-initiated jets are broader in shape with a higher particle multiplicity on average [283]. To some extent it is therefore possible to differentiate statistically between gluon and quark jets by looking into the jet substructure. Jet shapes, however, are also sensitive to non-perturbative effects of the parton fragmentation and the underlying event. Corresponding measurements are valuable inputs to improve the modelling of such soft contributions in MC event generators like Pythia, Herwig++, or Sherpa.  [284]. The data are compared to the prediction for gluon-initiated and quark-initiated jets using the Pythia6 MC event generator with tune Perugia2010. (Adapted from Refs. [284,285].) Figure 20(a) shows a CMS measurement [285] of the differential jet shape, for the example of the jet p T interval 110 < p T < 125 GeV, in comparison to several LO MC event generators at particle level. While Herwig++ and Pythia8 predict somewhat broader jet shapes than measured, the Pythia6 tunes D6T and Z2 deviate in the opposite direction. The best description of the data is given by Pythia6 with the tune Perugia2010, something, which is also observed in a similar investigation by the ATLAS collaboration [284]. By employing this tune for the integrated jet shape, shown in the form of 1\u2212\u03a8 (r = 0.3) as a function of the jet p T in figure 20(c), ATLAS demonstrates the sensitivity of this observable with respect to the jet-initiating parton. At small jet p T the examined inclusive jet sample is predominantly composed of gluon jets, while with increasing jet p T the quark-initiated component grows. In the figure, the change in the fraction of quark-initiated to gluon-initiated jets is averaged over the jet rapidity up to |y| < 2.8. If studied double-differentially, a mild dependence on |y| of this fraction is observed as expected. The sensitivity of jet shapes to non-perturbative effects and modelling uncertainties, however, prevents an extraction of the quark-gluon jet fraction. Instead, they provide valuable input to the tuning of these effects in MC event generators.",

A small correction for non-perturbative effects, which is p T -dependent and increases at small p T values, has to be taken into account. Looking more closely into the results presented by ATLAS for anti-k t jet sizes of R = 0.4 and 0. 6 [30] or by CMS for anti-k t jet sizes of R = 0.5 and 0.7 [31,32], it is observed that the relative normalisation of the measured cross sections to the theoretical predictions exhibits a dependence on R. Theoretically, this R dependence has been examined in Refs. [279,286], where in a collinear approximation it was found that the impact of perturbative radiation and of the non-perturbative effects of hadronisation and the underlying event on jet transverse momenta scales roughly with ln R, \u22121/R, and R 2 for small R, respectively. By choosing the jet size parameter R, one can therefore steer which aspects of jet formation are emphasised in a jet analysis. In Ref. [279] it is suggested, in order to gain insight into the interplay of these effects, to study the relative difference between inclusive jet cross sections that emerge from two different jet definitions:",

Figure 21(a) clearly demonstrates that fixed-order calculations up to NLO, even when combined with non-perturbative corrections, are systematically above the data. The LO event generators Pythia6 and Herwig++ lie systematically on either side of the data, as can be seen in figure 21(b).

This bound is independent of the details of the stronginteraction dynamics and states that the total cross section can not rise faster than ln 2 s [293].  Soft hadron collisions can not be calculated in perturbative QCD. Instead, they are usually described by phenomenological models where the force between hadrons is assumed to be mediated by mesons, for instance by pions [295]. The basic idea is that the exchanged meson interacts with the colour charges confined in the scattered hadrons. Since many mesons exists, the strong force between hadrons can be quite complicated in such models. The typical range of the strong force is anti-proportional to the mass of the exchanged meson. Consequently, the largest range is provided by the lightest meson which has the appropriate quantum numbers. Such models are usually called \"Regge theory\". For reviews see Refs. [296,297]. Regge theory aimed at explaining the spectrum of the various hadrons, the forces between them, and the high-energy behaviour of the hadron-hadron scattering cross section. It is based on simple assumptions like that the scattering matrix is analytic and unitary. Mesons are understood as composite quark-antiquark states bound by an effective strong potential that depends on the distance between the quark-antiquark pair r and the orbital angular momentum J. Elastic hadron-hadron scattering is viewed as the exchange of a meson in the s-channel or t-channel. In 1961, Chew and Frautschi [298] made the observation that for \u03c0 \u2212 p \u2192 \u03c0 0 n scattering there is a linear relation between the mass of the exchanged hadron (m) and its angular momentum J. Each integer value of the slope \u03b1-called \"Regge trajectory\"corresponds to one particle that can be experimentally identified (\"Regge-pole\"). In the time-like region where t > 0 (s-channel meson exchange) the momentum transfer t corresponds to the hadron mass m. If one continues the linear relation between m and J using the slope \u03b1 for t < 0, i.e. the space-like regime, a good description of the experimental measurements for \u03b1 is obtained. In this case, however, t can take any value. This trajectory is called \"Pomeron trajectory\". The exchanged object carrying the quantum numbers of the vacuum (C = P = 1) is called \"Pomeron\".",

Figure 22 shows the total inclusive protonproton cross section as a function of the centre-of-mass energy \u221a s for various experiments. In the range 2-20 GeV the proton-proton cross section decreases as measured by fixed-target experiments, while at higher energies it increases towards larger \u221a s. The difference between proton-proton and protonantiproton cross section decreases towards high energy; at about \u221a s \u2248 30 GeV, the two cross sections are very similar. The rise of the proton-antiproton cross section for \u221a s \u223c > 30 GeV was first observed at the SPS, confirmed by Tevatron and LHC, where the ATLAS [300], CMS [301] and TOTEM [302] experiments measured at \u221a s = 7 TeV (TOTEM measured also at \u221a s = 8 TeV [303]). Data from cosmic-ray experiments [304][305][306] are able to provide useful measurements at energies up to 60 TeV that are not covered by colliders. Overlayed in figure 22 as curve is a parameterisation [307] based on the ln 2 s behaviour that describes the data well at high energy.

In addition, the primary interaction may be accompanied by the production of further particles, a circumstance which is usually modelled in the form of multi-parton interactions (MPI).

Three event types are compared: minimum bias, dijet production, and inclusive Z production, with event scales chosen to be the p T of the leading track, the leading jet, and the Z boson, respectively. An approximately continuous transition from MB to jet events is visible in the inset plot. In the comparison between jet and Z events of the soft-particle density in the transverse region, which is attributed to the UE, differences are exhibited, which are even more pronounced in the average summed p T density of all tracks (not shown). These can be explained in terms of a bias between the definitions of the event scale. In the case of the jet events further jets with transverse momenta larger than the p T of the leading jet are forbidden by definition, while for the inclusive Z events additional jet activity with p jet T > p Z T is possible. Taking this bias into account, the conjecture that the UE activity is independent of the hard process is supported by the ATLAS measurement and by similar measurements from CMS [314].",

Corresponding measurements usually must be performed early on at the beginning of a data-taking period, when the instantaneous luminosity is small and the probability of multiple hadron-hadron collisions in the same or adjacent bunch crossings, the so-called pile-up, is negligible. It should be emphasised that such measurements are of utmost importance for a precise understanding of LHC data as they are used to model individual pile-up collisions. At later stages of the data-taking and with high instantaneous luminosity, the occurrence of up to 10-100 of such pile-up collisions simultaneously to the hard reaction of interest demands that these MB-like collisions are very well understood and modelled in simulations. Otherwise it becomes very difficult to precisely calibrate jet energies (see Chap. 3 of Ref. [1]) or to estimate the background to searches for new physics.

To some extent it is a great fortune that such a simple picture with only one interacting parton from each colliding hadron and only longitudinal degrees of freedom describes such a huge amount of measurements. Partially this is due to the fact that one is mostly interested in inclusive processes at large p T . Looking into the regime of small transverse momenta, however, it becomes apparent that this picture must fail, since otherwise the relevant cross sections would grow beyond all limits for p T \u2192 0. They would thus violate unitarity, i.e. become even larger than the measured total cross sections. So, somehow, the cross sections have to be regularised. Realising that at p T values of the order of a few GeV, protons are probed at fractional momenta of 10 -3 or below, one can interpret the consequently large parton densities in such a way that more than one parton per hadron participates in a scattering process. In terms of the MPI, as explained above, this concept has already been successfully applied to model the part of the soft-particle production that manifests itself in the form of the underlying event. The possibility of two hard or semi-hard reactions with two partons from each of the colliding hadrons participating in their own parton-parton scatter has not yet been considered, though.",

In this simple picture, \u03c3 eff is a measure of the overlap in transverse size of the parton distributions in the colliding hadrons. A naive geometrical interpretation leads to an estimate of \u03c3 eff \u2248 \u03c0R 2 p \u2248 50 mb, where R p is the proton radius. Measurements have been performed for a number of processes A and B: 4-jet [315,316], \u03b3+3-jet [317][318][319], and W +2-jet [320,321] production. In each case, the second independent scattering reaction is chosen to have a dijet final state, because dijet production occurs at by far the highest rates. To differentiate double-parton scattering from normal high-multiplicity single parton scattering events, the particular properties of DPS events are exploited: the p T of the jet pair (both jet pairs in 4-jet production) should be balanced and the azimuthal angle between the vectors of the final-state objects of the leading scattering and the lower-p T jet pair should be uncorrelated, i.e. randomly oriented. Specialising to W +2-jet events, observables sensitive to DPS can then be defined as",

These two innovative concepts enable fully exclusive predictions at particle-level with an inclusive production rate accurate to NLO or the first few hardest emissions being modelled through exact real-emission matrix elements. Consequently, Monte-Carlo simulations based on matching or merging of matrix elements and parton showers have become the standard tools in any LHC analysis.
