In large extra-dimensional models (e.g. the model proposed by Arkani-Hamed, Dimopoulos and Dvali (ADD) [1,2]) there are n additional flat extra dimensions, assumed to be compactified on a torus with a common radius much larger than 1/M D . Another class of models (e.g. that of Randall and Sundrum (RS)  [3,4]) uses one extra dimension in a highly warped anti-de-Sitter space. Both of these types of model can address the large difference between the scale of electroweak interactions, O(0.1 TeV), and that of gravity, the Planck scale, M Pl = O (10 16 TeV), in a natural way.",

            "text": "Interesting signatures are expected in these models in the form of non-perturbative gravitational states such as microscopic black holes [5,6]. Such final states could be produced in proton-proton (pp) interactions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) [7]. In the absence of a full theory of quantum gravity, predictions for production cross-sections and decays of black holes rely on semi-classical approximations which are expected to be valid if the mass of the black hole is well above M D and also higher than the Hawking temperature [8]. A strong rise in the production rate of such states is expected when the energy scale of the interactions reaches the order of M D . Since the gravitational interaction couples to the E-mail address: atlas.publications@cern.ch. energy-momentum tensor rather than gauge quantum numbers, final states are expected to be populated \"democratically\", according to the number of available Standard Model degrees of freedom. For this reason, it is expected that a significant fraction of final states would contain leptons. This search exploits this feature to enhance the signal contribution in comparison with the dominant background at the LHC, which arises from quark and gluon scattering processes forming hadronic final states. Final states with at least three high transverse momentum (p T ) objects are selected, of which at least one must be an electron or muon (leptons in what follows) and the others can be either leptons or hadronic jets. The discriminating variable used in this search, p T , is the scalar sum of the transverse momenta of high p T objects in an event. The signal is expected to appear at high p T . Searches by ATLAS [9][10][11][12] and CMS [13,14] during Run 1 of the LHC did not reveal any significant excesses over expected background levels. An ATLAS analysis [15] of Run-2 data at 13 TeV also found no evidence of new effects in multijet final states. This work extends the reach of the analysis in Ref. [12], performed at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV, with 3.2 fb \u22121 of data recorded by ATLAS in 2015 at 13 TeV. This search is potentially sensitive to other forms of new physics at high-mass and involving the electroweak sector.",

The CTEQ6L1 parton distribution functions (PDFs) used are taken from Ref. [20], while the final-state fragmentation and parton showering is modelled using Pythia8 [21]. The detector response is modelled using a fast simulation of the response of the calorimeters [22] and Geant4 [23] for other parts of the detector. Events from minimum-bias interactions are also simulated with Pythia8. They are overlaid on the simulated signal and background events according to the luminosity profile of the recorded data. Interactions within the same bunch crossing as the hard-scattering process and in neighbouring bunch crossings are both simulated and are referred to as pile-up. 1 ATLAS uses a right-handed coordinate system with its origin at the nominal interaction point (IP) in the centre of the detector and the z-axis along the beam direction.

The luminosity estimate is derived following the same methodology as that detailed in Ref.

The event selection uses the lowest-threshold single-lepton triggers available in each data-taking period with good operational conditions. The singleelectron trigger uses a minimum threshold of E T = 60 GeV. The minimum threshold used for the single-muon trigger is p T = 50 GeV. All the final-state objects are required to satisfy basic criteria to ensure that they are well reconstructed and originate from the primary interaction. Candidate electrons and muons are required to have p T > 10 GeV and pseudorapidity |\u03b7| < 2.47 (electrons) or |\u03b7| < 2.5 (muons). They are also required to satisfy baseline identification criteria (the \"Loose\" operating point of Ref.",

Each CR uses selections which enhance the contribution of the relevant background while maintaining a negligible expected signal contribution. Single-top-quark and diboson production processes give small contributions that are estimated directly from simulations, with normalisations taken from Refs.

The bosonic background processes are simulated using Sherpa 2.1 [36], while POWHEG [37-39] in conjunction with Pythia6 [40] is used for top quark production processes. All these background simulations use the CT10 PDF set [41]. The detector response is modelled using Geant4.

Experimental uncertainties arising from the trigger efficiencies, lepton identification and reconstruction procedures, the b-tagging algorithm and the energy calibration of leptons and jets, as well as effects from the jet energy resolution, are also taken into account. Potential mismodelling by the MC simulations of the W + jets, Z + jets and tt backgrounds is quantified by comparing the nominal against alternative simulated samples and PDF sets. For the W + jets and Z + jets backgrounds, simulated by Sherpa, the default renormalisation, factorisation and resummation scales are doubled or halved. The matrix element and parton shower are matched using the CKKW [44] scheme, for which the default scale of 20 GeV is changed to 15 GeV and to 30 GeV. For tt, uncertainties in the hard scatter and fragmentation are estimated by comparison with alternative generators and parton shower models. Variations of the renormalisation scale and of the amount of initial-and final-state radiation are performed within the nominal generator. Since the overall normalisations of the backgrounds are well constrained by the fits to the data described below, only variations in shape as a function of p T are relevant. The systematic uncertainty in the predicted yields in both channels of SR-2TeV and SR-3TeV is dominated by the limited sizes of the Monte Carlo samples. The total uncertainties in the SRs are mainly of statistical origin.",

These normalisation parameters are freely floating in the fits. Nuisance parameters are included in the fits to describe the systematic uncertainties, taking into account the correlations across the processes and regions involved in each fit. A background likelihood fit to all control regions of both lepton channels, assuming no signal contribution, is used to predict the expected yields in validation regions (VRs) and to test the hypothesis that the data is well described with no signal in these regions. The VRs are defined using the same event selections as the signal regions, but in the range 1500 < p T < 2000 GeV. As in the CRs, any signal contamination in the VRs is expected to be small, based on previous analyses [12] and on signal simulations. Comparisons between the data and the predictions in the control regions, where the background predictions are adjusted by the background likelihood fit, may be seen in Fig. 1. The MC simulation provides a good description of the CR data, with scale factors of 0.81 \u00b1 0.07, 1.01 \u00b1 0.08 and 0.95 \u00b1 0.08 for W + jets, Z + jets and tt respectively. No significant deviation from the background prediction is observed in the VRs. Fig. 2 shows the data and background predictions for p T in the electron and muon channels following the background likelihood fit, with two signal models overlaid. This figure uses the SR selection except for the final requirement on p T . The data are in good agreement with the background prediction across the range of p T which can be tested with the present data, with the size and pattern of deviations between data and background prediction being consistent with statistical fluctuations and the size of the systematic uncertainties. Table 2 presents the data and background predictions in the signal regions. The number of events observed in SR-3TeV is higher than the background estimate in the electron channel with a p-value of 1% when tested against the background-only hypothesis. The excess is not sufficiently significant to be considered as evidence of any new physics effect. The final results are therefore derived from the combination of the two channels. The observed numbers of events in SR-2TeV and SR-3TeV are 192 and 13 respectively for the combination of the electron and muon channels, to be compared with fitted background predictions of 181 \u00b1 11 and 9.9 \u00b1 1.4.",

The remaining electrons are required to satisfy the \"Tight\" operating point of Ref. [25]. Leptons are required to be isolated from other activity using a relatively loose criterion designed to pass 99% of leptons from Z decays [26,33]. Events are sorted into electron and muon channels according to the flavour of the highest p T lepton. Two signal regions (SRs) are defined, requiring a leading lepton with p T > 100 GeV and at least two other objects (leptons or jets) with p T > 100 GeV, with p T > 2 TeV or 3 TeV, where p T includes all objects in the event with p T > 60 GeV. The first signal region (named SR-2TeV) allows the search to cover the parameter space near the existing limits, while the second (named SR-3TeV) provides sensitivity at the highest p T accessible. The SR-3TeV selection gives efficiency \u00d7 acceptance values for the benchmark signal models of 19% (for the model at M D = 2 TeV, M th = 7 TeV) and 8% (for the model at M D = 4 TeV, M th = 6 TeV).",
