The idea is to measure the distribution of hadrons emitted on the opposite side of the direct photon. The feasibility of such measurements is studied by applying the approach on the simulation data, we have demonstrated that this method allows us to measure, with a good approximation, both the jet fragmentation and the back-toback azimuthal alignment of the direct photon and the jet. Comparing these two observables measured in pp collisions with the ones measured in AA collisions reveals the modifications induced by the medium on the jet structure and consequently allows us to infer the medium properties. In this contribution, we discuss a first attempt of such measurements applied to real proton-proton data from the ALICE experiment.",

Experiments at CERN's Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) [3] concluded on the indirect evidence of a \"new state of matter\". Current experiments at Brookhaven National Laboratory's Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) [4] have found that matter does not behave as an ideal gas of free quarks and gluons predicted by theory, but, rather, as an almost perfect fluid. The new experiment ALICE [5] at CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC), will push further the study of the QCD medium. Thanks to the huge step in collision energy ( \u221a s N N = 5.5 T eV in Pb-Pb collisions), LHC will open new avenues for the exploration of matter under extreme conditions of temperature and density. Since the hot QCD medium will be formed at higher temperatures than at RHIC, the deconfined phase will last longer and more readily modify our experimental probes, allowing for a more accurate study of this new state matter.",

Indeed, medium properties can be inferred from the modifications experienced by the partonic shower inside the medium. Partons are only observed indirectly, as a collimated jet of hadrons coming from the fragmentation of the partonic shower [6]. Comparing the measurements of the jet fragmentation in proton-proton and heavy-ion collisions will reveal the modifications produced by the medium on the hard scattered partons. Ideally, one needs to know the 4-momentum of the parton when it has been produced in the hard scattering and after it has been modified by the medium. This can be achieved by selecting particular hard processes in which there is a photon in the final state. Since the photon does not interact with the medium, its 4-momentum is not modified and thus provides a measure of the hard scattered parton emitted back-to-back with the photon. Measuring the hadrons opposite to the photon is thus a promising way to measure the jet fragmentation and misalignment between photon and hadrons to quantify the modifications due to the medium.",

However because of the limited acceptance covered by the calorimeters, the measurement is restricted by statistics to photon with energies below 50 GeV. This kinematic region is particularly interesting because jets of such low energy loose a large fraction of their energy while traversing the medium, rendering the medium modification most visible. In addition, because jets with energy below 50 GeV can hardly be reconstructed in the heavy-ion environment, the photon tagging technique provides a sensitive measurement of jets in this kinematic range. Systematic errors due to the improper identification of direct photons remain, within this kinematic range, lower than statistical errors from our study [11].",

The broadening can be related to the medium transport parameterq. However, the effect is quite small which will make the measurement in the heavy-ion environment quite challenging.

The resulting photon-triggered hadrons distributions, after subtraction of underlying events, are shown in Fig. 2, normalized to the number of trigger particles found in corresponding generation. The statistical errors are estimated from the annual yield of photon events with p T larger than 30 GeV we anticipate to collect during one PbPb run at nominal luminosity [5].

It is interesting to remark that at this very preliminary stage of the analysis we find that the underlying event background level, outside the peaks region, is independent of the type of trigger particles, giving some confidence in the measurement. By applying an isolation selection on the trigger candidate, where hadron activity carries less than 30 % transverse momentum of the trigger candidate inside a cone with size R = 0.4 required, the probability of direct photon or single particle jets in the sample enhances. Comparing the azimuthal correlation with and without isolation selection, obviously, a suppression of the near side peak is observed, but the away side peak is almost unaffected, as expected (Fig. 4). However this preliminary analysis does not allow to draw any conclusion other that these results indicate the expected behaviour.
