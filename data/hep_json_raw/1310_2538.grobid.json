            "text": "The constituent quark model [1][2][3] predicts the existence of multiplets of baryon and meson states, with a structure determined by the symmetry properties of the hadron wavefunctions. When considering u, d, s, and c quarks, the states form SU(4) multiplets [4]. The baryon ground states -those with no orbital or radial excitations -consist of a 20-plet with spin-parity J P = 1/2 + and a 20-plet with J P = 3/2 + . All of the ground states with charm quantum number C = 0 or C = 1 have been discovered [5]. Three weakly decaying C = 2 states are expected: a \u039e cc isodoublet (ccu, ccd) and an \u2126 cc isosinglet (ccs), each with J P = 1/2 + . This paper reports a search for the \u039e + cc baryon. There are numerous predictions for the masses of these states (see, e.g., ref. [6] and the references therein, as well as refs. [7][8][9][10][11]) with most estimates for the \u039e + cc mass in the range 3500-3700 MeV/c 2 . Predictions for its lifetime range between 100 and 250 fs [12][13][14].",

Double charm production has been observed previously at LHCb both in the J/\u03c8 J/\u03c8 final state [21] and in final states including one or two open charm hadrons [22]. Phenomenological estimates of the production cross-section of \u039e cc in pp collisions at \u221a s = 14 TeV are in the range 60-1800 nb [17,23,24]; the crosssection at \u221a s = 7 TeV is expected to be roughly a factor of two smaller. As is typical for charmed hadrons, the production is expected to be concentrated in the low transverse momentum (p T ) and forward rapidity (y) kinematic region instrumented by LHCb [24]. For comparison, the prompt \u039b + c cross-section in the range 0 < p T < 8000 MeV/c and 2.0 < y < 4.5 at \u221a s = 7 TeV has been measured to be (233\u00b126\u00b171\u00b114) \u00b5b at LHCb [25], where the uncertainties are statistical, systematic, and due to the description of the fragmentation model, respectively. Thus, the cross-section for \u039e + cc production at LHCb is predicted to be smaller than that for \u039b + c by a factor of order 10 \u22124 to 10 \u22123 . To reduce systematic uncertainties, the \u039e + cc cross-section is measured relative to that of the \u039b + c . This has the further advantage that it allows a direct comparison with previous experimental results. The production ratio R that is measured is defined as",

The detector includes a high-precision tracking system consisting of a silicon-strip vertex detector (VELO) surrounding the pp interaction region, a large-area silicon-strip detector located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4 Tm, and three stations of silicon-strip detectors and straw drift tubes placed downstream. The combined tracking system provides a momentum measurement with relative uncertainty that varies from 0.4% at 5 GeV/c to 0.6% at 100 GeV/c, and impact parameter (IP) resolution of 20 \u00b5m for tracks with large transverse momentum. Charged hadrons are identified using two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors [27]. Photon, electron, and hadron candidates are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter, and a hadronic calorimeter. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers [28]. The trigger [29] consists of a hardware stage, based on information from the calorimeter and muon systems, followed by a software stage, which applies a full event reconstruction.",

To minimise systematic differences in efficiency between the JHEP12(2013)090 signal and normalisation modes, the same trigger requirements are used for both modes, and those requirements ensure that the event was triggered by the \u039b + c candidate and its daughter tracks. First, at least one of the three \u039b + c daughter tracks must correspond to a calorimeter cluster with a measured transverse energy E T > 3500 MeV in the hardware trigger. Second, at least one of the three \u039b + c daughter tracks must be selected by the inclusive software trigger, which requires that the track have p T > 1700 MeV/c and \u03c7 2 IP > 16 with respect to any PV, where \u03c7 2 IP is defined as the difference in \u03c7 2 of a given PV reconstructed with and without the considered track. Third, the \u039b + c candidate must be reconstructed and accepted by a dedicated \u039b + c \u2192 pK \u2212 \u03c0 + selection algorithm in the software trigger. This algorithm makes several geometric and kinematic requirements, the most important of which are as follows. The three daughter tracks are required to have p T > 500 MeV/c 2 , to have a track fit \u03c7 2 /ndf < 3, not to originate at a PV (\u03c7 2 IP > 16), and to meet at a common vertex (\u03c7 2 /ndf < 15, where ndf is the number of degrees of freedom). The \u039b + c candidate formed from the three tracks is required to have p T > 2500 MeV/c 2 , to lie within the mass window 2150 < m([pK \u2212 \u03c0 + ] \u039bc ) < 2430 MeV/c 2 , to be significantly displaced from the PV (vertex separation \u03c7 2 > 16), and to point back towards the PV (momentum and displacement vectors within 1 \u2022 ). The software trigger also requires that the proton candidate be inconsistent with the pion and kaon mass hypotheses. The \u039b + c trigger algorithm was only enabled for part of the data-taking in 2011, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 0.65 fb \u22121 .",

Table 4 shows the expected signal yield, calculated according to eq. (1.1), for various values of R and lifetime hypotheses. From studies of the sidebands in m([pK \u2212 \u03c0 + ] \u039bc ) and \u03b4m, the expected background in the narrow signal window is between 10 and 20 events. Thus, no significant signal excess is expected if the value of R at LHCb is in the range suggested by theory. However, if production is greatly enhanced for baryon-baryon collisions at high rapidity, as reported at SELEX, a large signal may be visible. The procedure for determining the significance of a signal, or for establishing limits on R, is discussed in the following section. the look elsewhere effect (LEE) [40] must be taken into account. The procedure used is to generate a large number of pseudo-experiments containing only background events, with the amount and distribution of background chosen to match the data (as estimated from sidebands). For each pseudo-experiment, the full analysis procedure is applied in the same way as for data, and the local significance is measured at all 501 values of \u03b4m. The LEEcorrected p-value for a given S is then taken to be the fraction of the pseudo-experiments that contain an equal or larger local significance at any point in the \u03b4m range. The procedure established before unblinding is that if no signal with an LEE-corrected significance of at least 3\u03c3 is seen, upper limits on R will be quoted. The CL s method [41,42] is applied to determine upper limits on R for a particular \u03b4m and lifetime hypothesis, given the observed yield N S+B and expected background N B in the signal window obtained as described in section 4. The statistical uncertainty on N B and systematic uncertainties on \u03b1 are taken into account. The 95% CL upper limit is then taken as the value of R for which CL s = 0.05. Upper limits are calculated at each of the 501 \u03b4m hypotheses, and for five lifetime hypotheses (100, 150, 250, 333, 400 fs).",
