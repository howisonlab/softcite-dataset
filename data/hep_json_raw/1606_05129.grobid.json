The search is based on observables related to large ionisation losses and slow propagation velocities, which are signatures of heavy charged particles travelling significantly slower than the speed of light. No significant deviations from the expected background are observed. Upper limits at 95% confidence level are provided on the production cross section of long-lived R-hadrons in the mass range from 600 GeV to 2000 GeV and gluino, bottom and top squark masses are excluded up to 1580 GeV, 805 GeV and 890 GeV, respectively.",

A search for composite colourless states of squarks or gluinos together with SM quarks or gluons, called R-hadrons [11], is presented in this Letter. The search exploits the fact that these particles are expected to propagate with a velocity, \u03b2 = v/c, substantially lower than one and to exhibit a specific ionisation energy loss, dE/dx, larger than that for any charged SM particle. Similar searches have been performed previously by the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations [18,19] using data samples from Run 1 at the LHC. No excesses of events above the expected backgrounds were observed, and lower mass limits were set at 95% confidence level (CL) around 1300 GeV for gluino R-hadrons.",

The charge released by the passage of a charged particle is rarely contained within a single silicon pixel, and a neural network algorithm [24] is used to form clusters from the single pixel charges. For each cluster in the pixel detector a dE/dx estimate can be provided, from which an overall dE/dx measurement is calculated as a truncated mean to reduce the effect of the tail of the Landau distribution, by disregarding the one or two largest measurements [25]. Radiation sensitivity of the IBL electronics results in the measured dE/dx drifting over time. This effect is corrected by applying a dedicated time-dependent ionisation correction of 1.2% on average. The mean and RMS of the dE/dx measurement for a minimum-ionising particle are 1.12 MeV g \u22121 cm 2 and 0.13 MeV g \u22121 cm 2 , respectively, while the distribution extends to higher dE/dx values, due to the remnants of the Landau tail.",

Pair production of gluinos and squarks is simulated in Pythia 6.427 [27] with the AUET2B [28] set of tuned parameters for the underlying event and the CTEQ6L1 [29] parton distribution function (PDF) set, incorporating Pythia-specific specialised hadronisation routines [20,30,31] to produce final states containing R-hadrons. The masses of the other SUSY particles are set to very high values to ensure that their contribution to the production cross section is negligible. For a given sparticle mass the production cross section for gluino R-hadrons is typically an order of magnitude higher than for bottom-squark and top-squark R-hadrons. The probability for a gluino to form a gluon-gluino bound state is assumed, based on a colour-octet model, to be 10% [12]. The associated hadronic activity produced by the colour field of the sparticle typically only possesses a small fraction of the initial energy of the sparticle [12], which should therefore be reasonably isolated.",

Furthermore, the candidates must not have any additional nearby ( R < 0.2) tracks with p T > 10 GeV. Tracks reconstructed with p > 6.5 TeV are rejected as unphysical. To ensure a well reconstructed track, a minimum number of seven hits in the silicon detectors is required. Of these, at least two clusters used to measure dE/dx in the pixel detector are required, to ensure a good dE/dx measurement. Candidates with |z PV 0 sin(\u03b8 )| > 0.5 mm or |d 0 | > 2.0 mm are removed, where d 0 is the transverse impact parameter at the candidate track's point of closest approach to the IP and z PV 0 is the z coordinate of this point relative to the PV. To suppress background muons stemming from cosmicray interactions, candidates with direction (\u03b7, \u03c6) are rejected if an oppositely-charged track with almost specular direction, i.e. with | \u03b7| < 0.005 and | \u03c6| < 0.005 with respect to",
