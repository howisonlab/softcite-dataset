Several parameters describing the B 0 s meson were measured, with 4.9 fb \u22121 of 2011 data, using flavour tagging and their values are consistent with the theoretical expectations. The CP-violating phase \u03c6 s for the B 0 s meson was measured to be \u03c6 s = 0.12\u00b10.25(stat.)\u00b1 0.11(syst.) rad.

Updated analyses including higher integrated luminosity and new analysis methods are expected to lower the systematic uncertainties and improve the precision of the results that now are dominated by statistical uncertainties.",
