            "text": "Charmonium states consist of a heavy charm-anticharm quark pair, which allows the prediction of some of the parameters of these states using nonrelativistic and relativistic potential models [1], lattice QCD [2], non-relativistic effective field theory (NRQCD) [3], and sum rules [4] (see the recent review in [5]). The comparison of these predictions with experimental results provides an opportunity to tune the parameters of theoretical models and, therefore, improve the accuracy of other values predicted by these models. We have to measure the charmonium masses, widths, and product branching fractions with enough accuracy to compare them with theoretical predictions. Parameters of (cc) states such as the \u03b7 c and \u03b7 c (2S) mesons have been studied in various experiments using a variety of decay channels [6]. Tables 1 and 2, which list a selection of most precise mass and width determinations, show that there is quite a large spread of measured masses and widths of the \u03b7 c and, especially, \u03b7 c (2S) mesons resulting in large scale factors for the world average values [6]. Moreover, our knowledge of hadronic decays of these charmonia is rather poor.",

Since the \u03b7 c and \u03b7 c (2S) are pseudoscalars (J P = 0 \u2212 ), we expect a uniform distribution in cos \u03b8. In Figs and \u03b7 c (2S) signal and sideband regions, while the combinatorial background is subtracted. One can see that the sideband distribution has contributions from higher angular waves. A good fit can be obtained with the sum of S-, P-, and D-waves. The signal region also contains non-resonant background but mostly consists of signal events, so the S-wave contribution here is dominant. Separation of the P-and D-waves from the S-wave in the non-resonant background allows the uncertainty from interference to be reduced. We exclude the J/\u03c8 region (3.07 -3.13 GeV/c 2 ) from the fit because the interference of the J/\u03c8 and non-resonant signal is negligible due to the small width of the former and inclusion of this region does not constrain the \u03b7 c interference contribution. Moreover, the J/\u03c8 angular distribution has contributions from several amplitudes that are not well determined. The same arguments apply to the exclusion of the \u03c7 c1 mass region (3.48 -3.54 GeV/c 2 ). We perform separate fits to the J/\u03c8 and \u03c7 c1 with Gaussian functions using 1-D K S K\u03c0 invariant mass distributions from signal MC and data. After comparing the obtained widths we determine the degradation of the resolution in data.

            "text": "We evaluated possible sources of systematic uncertainties in the product branching fractions. The number of BB pairs is calculated from the difference of the number of hadronic events on resonance and the scaled number of those offresonance. The systematic error is dominated by the uncertainty in the scale factor and is equal to \u223c1.3%. We assume that the combinatorial background can be parameterized with a first-order polynomial. To obtain the background shape uncertainty, we describe the background by a second-order polynomial and compare the results. The uncertainty on the K S decay branching fraction is taken from [6]. The contribution of the K S reconstruction uncertainty was estimated in the Belle experiment to be 4.4% [21]. In our fitting procedure we take into account the efficiency dependence on cos \u03b8 and assume that it does not depend on the K S K\u03c0 invariant mass. By adding a linear dependence on M(K S K\u03c0) we estimate the corresponding systematic error. Moreover, we take into account the dependence of the efficiency on the \u03b7 c and \u03b7 c (2S) decay models, such as KK * , KK * 0 (1430), and KK * 2 (1430). The corresponding contribution to the systematic uncertainty is estimated by varying the efficiency obtained using these models and taking the difference in the results. An analysis of the charged track reconstruction uncertainty as a function of particle momenta has been performed in Belle data and gave an estimate of 1% per charged track. To determine the errors due to K and \u03c0 meson identification, data from analysis of the process D * + \u2192 D 0 \u03c0 + followed by the decay D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + were used. The uncertainty in K \u00b1 identification is 0.8% per K meson and the corresponding value for \u03c0 \u00b1 identification is 0.5% per \u03c0 meson. We also take into account the deviation of MC from the data by applying a correction to the efficiency: \u03b5 Data \u03b5 M C is 0.9996 for each kaon and 0.9756 for each pion. We vary the bin size along the x axis from 0.15 to 0.225, the \u2206E window from 20 MeV to 40 MeV, and the detector resolution within the limits of its statistical uncertainty.",

The scale uncertainty is determined from a comparison of masses of the J/\u03c8 (\u03c7 c1 ) resonances, which were obtained by fitting the K S K\u03c0 invariant mass distribution, with the world average values [6]. In case two kaons of the same charge are present in the final state, the charmonium amplitude is a sum of two amplitudes corresponding to K S K (1) \u03c0 and K S K (2) \u03c0 combinations. This can lead to the deformation of the K S K\u03c0 invariant mass distribution in the region of phase space where the K S K (1) \u03c0 and K S K (2) \u03c0 invariant mass values overlap. We use toy MC to estimate this effect and take it into account as an additional systematic error.",

This effect can allow the improvement of the statistical accuracy with which the Breit-Wigner width is determined. In particular, the \u03b7 c (2S) width, obtained in the present work, has a rather good accuracy, despite limited statistics and a detector resolution broader than the intrinsic width. The interference deforms the Breit-Wigner, lengthening its tail and thus improves the fit to the width (see Fig. 10).",
