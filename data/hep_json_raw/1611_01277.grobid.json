In this talk I present: some recent preliminary BESIII results on the near-threshold behavior of \u03c3(e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u039b\u039b) that may or may not be related to multiquark mesons in the light-and strange-quark sectors; results from Belle and LHCb on the electrically charged, charmoniumlike Z(4430) \u00b1 \u2192 \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03c8 \u2032 resonance that necessarily has a four-quark substructure; and the very recent LHCb discovery of the P c (4380) and P c (4450) hidden-charm resonances seen as a complex structure in the J/\u03c8 p invariant mass distribution for \u039b b \u2192 K \u2212 J/\u03c8 p decays and necessarily have a five-quark substructure and are, therefore, prominent candidates for pentaquark baryons.",

            "text": "Gell-Mann, in his original quark model paper, speculated that in addition to the quark-antiquark (qq) mesons and quark-quark-quark (qqq) baryons that account for the octets and decuplets of flavor-S U (3), there could be more complex structures such as qqqq tetraquark mesons and qqqqq pentaquark baryons [1]. Zweig made similar speculations in his contemporaneous paper on \"aces\" [2]. However, despite a considerable multi-decade experimental effort at searching for examples of resonances with these multiquark configurations in the light (u, d) and strange (s) quark sectors, no compelling multiquark candidates were identified. On the other hand, during the last decade a number of electrically charged mesons that contain a heavy quark pair (i.e., QQ, where Q = c or b) plus a pair of light quarks have been observed. (For recent reviews see refs. [3][4][5].) This year, the LHCb experiment presented striking evidence for J/\u03c8 p resonances in \u039b b \u2192 K \u2212 J/\u03c8 p decays [6] that are strong candidates for the pentaquark states that were first suggested by Gell-Mann and Zweig over fifty years ago.",

Candidates for an \u03b7\u03c0 meson resonance with an exotic J PC = 1 \u2212+ quantum number assignment are discussed in ref. [7]; the interpretation of the anomalously narrow a 1 (1420) axial vector state, reported by the COMPASS experiment [8], as a four-quark state is still not settled. Anomalies in the light scalar octet, especially the masses and properties of the f 0 (980) and a 0 (980) mesons, have been interpreted as evidence for multi-quark states. Recent measurements by BES [9] and Belle [10] have provided experimental support for this point of view [11]. In addition, there are a number of puzzles associated with near-threshold nucleon-antinucleon systems that may point to six-quark \"baryonium\" NN bound states. These include a prominent threshold pp mass peak in radiative J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3pp decays reported by BESII [12], hints of anomalous behavior of the time-like neutron form-factor seen in e + e \u2212 \u2192 nn by Fenice [13] and SND [14], and signs of an anomalous near-threshold angular distribution for e + e \u2212 \u2192 pp by BaBar [15] and CMD-3 [16].",

The non-isotropic angular distributions are measured at \u27e8\u03b2\u27e9 = 0.11, and may become isotropic at even smaller \u03b2 values. On the other hand, the data also point to the possibility that something interesting may be lurking near the \u221a s = 2m B thresholds. This has stimulated experimental studies at other baryon thresholds by BESIII, which has recently released preliminary results of cross section measurements near the \u039b\u039b threshold. and Fenice (open black squares). b)( Figure 16 from ref. [16].) Measurements of \u03c3(e + e \u2212 \u2192 pp) from BaBar (red inverted triangles) and CMD-3 (solid black squares). No sign of a \u03c3 \u221d \u03b2 behavior at threshold is evident. Figure 3a shows an event in the BESIII detector that is typical of most of the events in the raw data sample and atypical of the events that are usually shown in a talk like this. This particular event has two high momentum tracks that probably triggered the event, but these do not originate from the e + e \u2212 interaction point (IP) in the center of the beam pipe, instead they appear to come from an interaction in the material of the beam pipe and the inner wall of the detector, which has an inner radius of 3 cm. A large fraction of BESIII triggers are due to high momentum tracks produced by electrons (or positrons) in the BEPCII beams that lose energy via bremsstrahlung on residual gas atoms in the collider vacuum system or get lost due to the Touchek effect and are over-focused into the beampipe, where they interact. These account for most of the raw-data events collected by e + e \u2212 collider experiments, which deliberately use very loose trigger requirements. These \"beam-wall\" events are usually filtered out by sophisticated software during off-line data processing.",

            "text": "A BaBar study of the B \u2192 K\u03c0 + \u03c8 \u2032 decay channel neither confirmed nor contradicted the Belle result [24]. Although BaBar saw an excess of events in the same M(\u03c0 + \u03c8 \u2032 ) region as the Belle signal, their fit using Belle's mass and width values yielded a statistically marginal (\u223c 2\u03c3) Z(4430) \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c8 \u2032 signal. Belle responded to concerns about the possibility of \"reflection\" peaks in the M(\u03c0 + \u03c8 \u2032 ) distribution, produced by interference between different partial waves in the K\u03c0 channels, by doing a coherent amplitude analysis of the B \u2192 K\u03c0 + \u03c8 \u2032 decay process that used a kinematically complete, four-dimensional (4D) set of variables: M(K\u03c0 + ); M(\u03c0 + \u03c8 \u2032 ); the \u03c8 \u2032 \u2192 \u2113 + \u2113 \u2212 decay helicity angle and the angle between the K\u03c0 + and \u03c8 \u2032 \u2192 \u2113 + \u2113 \u2212 decay planes [25]. An isobar model amplitude that included all known K\u03c0 resonances and allowed for contributions from possible additional, unknown ones, was applied. This analysis confirmed the existence of a resonance in the \u03c0 + \u03c8 \u2032 channel with greater than 6\u03c3 significance, but with larger mass and width values than those of the ref. [23] analysis: M = 4485 +36 \u221225 MeV and \u0393 = 200 +48 \u221258 MeV. The source of the upward mass and width shifts from the original Belle results can be seen in Fig. 6b, which shows a comparison of projections of the 4D fit results with the experimental M 2 (\u03c0 + \u03c8 \u2032 ) distribution with the K * veto applied. The dashed red histogram shows the best fit results with no resonance in the \u03c0 + \u03c8 \u2032 channel; the solid blue histogram shows results with the inclusion of a single \u03c0 + \u03c8 \u2032 resonance, where strong interference effects that are constructive below, and destructive above, the resonance mass, are evident. The ref. [23] and [24] analyses neglected effects of interference between the Z \u2192 \u03c0\u03c8 \u2032 and the K * \u2192 K\u03c0 amplitudes, and only fitted the low-mass lobe of the dipolelike interference pattern, with a resultant lower mass and narrower width.",

The LHCb group tried to fit the data with isobar models that included a number of K \u2212 p resonances with and without resonance terms in the J/\u03c8 p channel. Because of the non-zero \u039b 0 b spin, the complete kinematic characterization of these decays requires six independent parameters, for which the LHCb group uses M(K \u2212 p) and five angles. The red dots with errors [31] in Fig. 8a show the M(J/\u03c8 p) projection of the best fit that could be achieved using an extensive set of \u039b * \u2192 K \u2212 p resonances and no resonances in the J/\u03c8 p system. This fit, which reproduces the M(K \u2212 p) distribution well, undershoots the M(J/\u03c8 p) data in the 4.4 GeV peak region and overshoots it at higher masses, similar to the case for the Z(4430) described in the previous subsection. The best fit to the data, shown as the red dots in Fig. 8b is accomplished with a model that includes two resonances in the J/\u03c8 p channel: a broad J P = 3/2 \u2212 resonance with M = 4380\u00b18\u00b129 MeV and \u0393 = 201\u00b118\u00b186 MeV, and a narrow 5/2 + resonance with M = 4449.8\u00b1 1.7 \u00b1 2.5 MeV and \u0393 = 39 \u00b1 5 \u00b1 19 MeV, where the first (second) error is statistical (systematic). The statistical significance of each state is over 9\u03c3, but the best fit (3/2 \u2212 , 5/2 + ) assignment is only marginally better than (3/2 + , 5/2 \u2212 ) or (5/2 + , 3/2 \u2212 ), which cannot be ruled out. Although there is some ambiguity in the J P assignments, all the acceptable fits find that the P c (4380) and P c (4450) have opposite parities. Figure 9 shows Argand plots for the two P c resonant amplitudes. While both plots show strong phase motion in the vicinity of the resonance mass peaks, only the higher mass P c (4450) shows good agreement with expectations for a BW amplitude. This may be due in part to the broad and less distinct nature of the the P c (4380), which makes the shape of this amplitude more sensitive to the details of the \u039b * contributions to the fit. On the other hand, this may be an indication of a more complex structure that the statistical accuracy of the current LHCb data sample is unable to resolve. The LHCb results provide strong evidence for the existence of pentaquark systems. However, their underlying structure remains unclear. Cusp models require, and molecule models like, nearby thresholds [32]. Table I shows the thresholds forD orD * meson and \u039b c , \u03a3 c or \u03a3 * c , and \u03c7 c0 p & \u03c7 c1 baryon combinations, where there do not seem to be any compelling matches for the measured P c masses of 4380 and 4450 MeV. The \u03a3 * c -\u03a3 c mass difference is similar to that for the P c (4450)-P c (4380), but the \u03a3 * c and \u03a3 c have the same parity, while the parities of the P c (4450) and P c (4380) are opposite. The close coincidence of the P c (4450) mass and m p + m \u03c7 c 1 prompted a suggestion that the peak may be due to a p\u03c7 c1 threshold cusp [33], but there is no similar threshold coincidence for the P c (4380). Similarly, some explicit molecular model calculations claim success for one, but usually not both, of the P c states [34][35][36][37][38]. Tightly bound diquark-diquark-antiquark systems have been proposed that account for both P c states [39][40][41][42][43][44]. ",

What is not so clear is their basic underlying structure. Are they extended molecule-like arrangements of color singlet hadrons that are loosely bound by nuclear-like forces? ...or compact structures containing colored diquarks tightly bound by the strong color force? ...or some quantum mechanical mixture of these (and other) possibilities? Now there are no strong compelling reasons to prefer one over the other scenarios. Hopefully, experimental observations of more states, other decay modes and different production mechanisms may give us some clues. Among the other XYZ states, not mentioned in this report, Argand plots that conclusively show that these are true resonances, and not artifacts of kinematic or coupled channel effects [45][46][47] would be welcome. The above could be done with large data samples collected by the BESIII detector [48] at energies near the Y(4260) and Y(4360) peaks and, sometime in the future, with the huge data samples that will be available to BelleII [49] and the upgraded LHCb detector [50].",
