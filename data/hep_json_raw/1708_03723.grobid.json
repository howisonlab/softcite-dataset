Differential cross sections for muon momentum and production angle, \u03c0 0 kinetic energy and production angle, and for squared fourmomentum transfer are reported, and the cross section \u03c3(E\u03bd ) is obtained over the range 1.5 GeV \u2264 E\u03bd < 20 GeV. Results are compared to GENIE and NuWro predictions and to published MINERvA cross sections for charged current \u03c0 + (\u03c0 0 ) production by \u03bd\u00b5(\u03bd\u00b5) neutrinos. Disagreements between data and simulation are observed at very low and relatively high values for muon angle and for Q 2 that may reflect shortfalls in modeling of interactions on carbon. For \u03c0 0 kinematic distributions however, the data are consistent with the simulation and provide support for generator treatments of pion intranuclear scattering. Using signal-event subsamples that have reconstructed protons as well as \u03c0 0 mesons, the p\u03c0 0 invariant mass distribution is obtained, and the decay polar and azimuthal angle distributions in the rest frame of the p\u03c0 0 system are measured in the region of \u2206(1232) + production, W < 1.4 GeV.",

For E \u03bd \u2264 3 GeV, CC(\u03c0) reactions are mostly instances of neutrino-nucleon scattering wherein a bound nucleon is struck and caused to transition into a baryon resonance that promptly decays into a pion and a nucleon. Production of the \u2206(1232) P 33 resonance is prominent and causes CC(\u03c0) cross sections to rise rapidly from thresholds. As the incident E \u03bd is increased however, contributions from higher-mass N * resonances such as the P 11 (1440), D 13 (1520), and S 11 (1535) states become significant. Increasing E \u03bd also facilitates the onset of deep inelastic scattering, in which the neutrino interacts with a valence or sea quark within a bound nucleon and the exiting quark hadronizes into one or multiple pions. Single pion production can also arise from neutrino-nucleon scattering that does not involve a resonance. Such processes are referred to as nonresonant pion production and are often treated as a subsample of DIS processes that have final-state hadronic invariant masses W less than 1.7 GeV [1].",

            "text": "Charged-current single pion production features prominently among neutrino interactions that occur within or around the appearance peaks or the disappearance minima in events-vs-E \u03bd spectra measured by the long baseline neutrino oscillation experiments. This is especially the case for NOvA and DUNE [2,3] since the \u03bd \u00b5 fluxes of these experiments have maxima at 2.0 GeV and 2.5 GeV respectively. Improved knowledge of CC(\u03c0) is also of keen interest for the T2K and HyperK long baseline experiments [4,5] whose flux spectra peak below 1.0 GeV, especially with regard to \u2206(1232) and nonresonant pion contributions. In long baseline oscillation experiments, neutrino event energies need to be measured to precisions of e.g. \u2264 100 MeV for DUNE and \u2264 50 MeV for T2K [6] in order to resolve the neutrino-sector CP violating phase and of the ordering of the neutrino mass states. Consequently new measurements of CC(\u03c0) reactions on hydrocarbon and on other nuclei in the few-GeV region of E \u03bd are urgently needed. Such measurements enable the testing and refinement of the neutrino event generators, e.g. GENIE [7], NEUT [8], NuWro [9], and GIBUU [10]. The predictions of these generators are a crucial element in physics evaluations of oscillated neutrino event spectra.",

            "text": "is of particular interest. In contrast to charged pion production, the events of channel (1) have electromagnetic showers as the dominant part of the visible hadronic system. As a result, channel (1) provides useful information about the responses of detector systems to both signal and backgrounds for the electron-neutrino oscillation appearance measurements, \u03bd \u00b5 \u2192 \u03bd e . While the cross section for CC(\u03c0 0 ) is smaller than for CC(\u03c0 + ) processes, the single-\u03c0 0 channel is devoid of CC single pion coherent scattering (e.g. \u03bd \u00b5 + C \u2192 \u00b5 \u2212 \u03c0 + +C), consequently its final-state distributions provide an unencumbered view of W + excitation of the nucleon [11,12]. Thus for example a four-momentum transfer, Q 2 , distribution measured for CC(\u03c0 0 ) is directly representative of the channel, whereas a Q 2 distribution obtained with CC(\u03c0 + ) events will include an elevated event rate at low Q 2 arising from coherent \u03c0 + production -a very different reaction type that may necessitate a further accounting [13]. An additional simplification is that single-\u03c0 0 production is composed of carbon-target scattering almost entirely. According to the reference simulation of this analysis, scatters from hydrogen account for less than 3.3% of the candidate signal sample. The kinematic spectra of the \u03c0 0 mesons of (1) provide useful checks on simulation treatments of pion final-state interactions (FSI) that can take place within the struck carbon nucleus. The \u03c0 0 distributions in kinetic energy and production angle probe the suite of elastic, inelastic, absorption, and charge-exchange scattering algorithms that are used in these treatments in ways that complement constraints gleaned from charged pion distributions [14,15].",

Neutrino-induced single-pion production at E \u03bd \u2264 1.5 GeV was studied using hydrogen and deuterium fills in Argonne National Laboratory's (ANL) 12-ft diameter bubble chamber; cross sections and distributions of pion-nucleon invariant mass and of Q 2 were reported [17,18]. Similar measurements with higher statistics were subsequently obtained using Brookhaven National Laboratory's (BNL) 7-ft deuterium-filled bubble chamber exposed to a neutrino beam with an average energy of 1.6 GeV [19]. In these two experiments, the \u2206 ++ (1232) was found to dominate the p\u03c0 + finalstate with no other resonance structure observed. For the p\u03c0 0 and n\u03c0 + final states however, \u2206 + production was accompanied by a broad N \u03c0-mass distribution extending to 2.5 GeV. Measurements of CC(\u03c0) reactions at much higher E \u03bd , for\u03bd \u00b5 as well as for \u03bd \u00b5 scattering, were reported in the late 1980's by experiments using the SKAT heavy liquid bubble chamber at Serpukhov (3 < E \u03bd < 30 GeV) [20], and by the deuterium-filled Big European Bubble Chamber at CERN ( E \u03bd = 54 GeV) [21]. The neutrino-induced \u03c0 0 p invariant mass distributions of the latter experiments showed the contributions from higher-mass baryon resonances to be increasing relative to the \u2206(1232) contribution in this final state, and in the \u03c0 + n final state as well.",

The MiniBooNE experiment used its spherical, 12 m diameter\u010cerenkov detector filled with mineral oil (CH 2 ) exposed to neutrinos of 0.5 to 2.0 GeV with peak flux at 0.6 GeV. The CC(\u03c0 0 ) cross section was obtained, and differential cross sections for muon and \u03c0 0 kinematics and for Q 2 were reported [22]. The K2K experiment used neutrino scattering on extruded scintillator (polystyrene) bars to obtain the ratio of CC(\u03c0 0 ) to quasielastic scattering at a mean neutrino energy of 1.3 GeV [23].",

            "text": "Recent theoretical treatments of CC(\u03c0 0 ) can be roughly categorized in terms of eras of endeavor. In the pre-MiniBooNE era, investigations focussed on refining the phenomenology and used the bubble chamber data to obtain cross checks on the formalism [24][25][26][27][28]. With the advent of CC(\u03c0 +,0 ) measurements reported by MiniBooNE [22,29], the focus shifted to developing explanations for the new data [30][31][32]. Comparisons between predictions and MiniBooNE results turned up discrepancies in the shapes of distributions of final-state \u03c0 0 mesons, highlighting the interplay between pion FSI processes and possible formation time effects [32]. Comparisons with the MiniBooNE data have continued into the present era, however phenomenological studies have expanded their purview to the higher-energy pion production results reported by MINERvA and to measurements underway by T2K [11,[33][34][35].",

Results are obtained with good statistics on a hydrocarbon target, a medium whose atomic number composition is an excellent match to NOvA's liquid scintillator medium and does not differ greatly from T2K's water medium.

In the present analysis the spectrometer's central, scintillator tracking region serves as the target, with the surrounding electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters providing containment. The fiducial volume has a hexagonal cross section of 2.0 m minimal diameter, extends longitudinally for 2.4 m, and has a mass of 5400 kg. It consists of 106 planes, each of \u223c 2 cm thickness, composed of polystyrene scintillator strips oriented transversely to the detector's horizontal axis. The planes are configured into modules. There are two planes per module, with an air gap of 2.5 mm between each module. The horizontal axis is inclined 3.3 \u2022 relative to the beam axis. Three scintillator-plane orientations, at 0 \u2022 and \u00b160 \u2022 relative to the detector vertical axis, provide X, U, and V \"views\" of interactions in the scintillator medium. The planes alternate between UX and VX pairs, enabling 3-D reconstruction of vertices, charged tracks, and electromagnetic showers of neutrino events. The downstream electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) is identical to the central tracking region but includes a 0.2 cm (0.35 radiation lengths) lead sheet in front of every two planes of scintillator. The readout electronics have a timing resolution of 3.0 ns for hits of minimumionizing particles [42], allowing the efficient separation of multiple interactions within a single 10 \u00b5s beam spill.",

Neutrino-induced pion production arises from interaction with a single nucleon and proceeds either by baryonresonance excitation or by non-resonant DIS processes. Baryon-resonance pion production is simulated using the Rein-Sehgal model [53] with incorporation of modern baryon resonance properties [54]. Decays of baryon resonances are generated isotropically in their rest frames, but an exception is made for the \u2206 ++ . In MINERvA's GENIE-based simulation, \u2206 ++ decays are generated with an angular isotropy at 50% of the strength predicted by Rein-Sehgal [14]. Non-resonant pion production is modeled according to the formalism of Bodek-Yang [55] with parameters adjusted to reproduce electron and neutrino scattering measurements over the invariant hadronic mass range W < 1.7 GeV [1,56,57]. No allowance is made for interferences among baryonresonance amplitudes.",

Accounting for pion FSI is especially important to this analysis because of the large pion-nucleon cross sections that occur in the vicinity of \u2206-resonance excitation. In GENIE, an effective model for FSI is used in lieu of a full intranuclear cascade; each pion is allowed to have at most one rescattering interaction while traversing the nucleus [58]. This approximation works well for a light nucleus such as carbon and it makes the simulation amenable to event reweighting. It has been shown by MINERvA studies of \u03bd \u00b5 -CC(\u03c0 + ) and\u03bd \u00b5 -CC(\u03c0 0 ) that GENIE FSI improves the agreement between simulation and data for pion kinematic distributions [13][14][15].",

The data distribution is examined after background subtraction, where the background consists of selected events whose out-of-nucleus final-state particle content is not consistent with reaction (1). The background estimation is constrained by fitting the data to four different sideband distributions (see Sec. IV). The peak position for the data distribution was found to be 137.8 \u00b1 2.6 MeV, while the peak position for the MC distribution was 130.3 \u00b1 1.6 MeV. Correction factors were then applied to the absolute scales for electromagnetic energy, separately in the data and the MC, that adjusted the M \u03b3\u03b3 peaks to match the nominal \u03c0 0 mass (134.97 MeV). These tunings of EM absolute energy scales have been applied to the distributions of Fig. 3 and to all subsequent Figures. Figure 3 shows the M \u03b3\u03b3 distribution for the data (solid circles), for the signal distribution as predicted by the MC (upper histogram in Fig. 3a and histogram of Fig. 3b), and for the background distribution predicted by the MC (lower histogram in Fig. 3a). The distributions shown are normalized to the POT of the data exposure, with the normalization of the estimated background ( Fig. 3a, lower histogram) constrained via fitting to four data sidebands as described in Sec. IV. The peak in the data coincides with the \u03c0 0 mass. The signal-plusbackground as estimated by the MC follows the shape of the data (Fig. 3a, upper histogram). The estimated signal, which is shown in Fig. 3b after background subtraction, distributes broadly and skews toward lower invariant mass. The skew reflects the loss of hits from EM showers that travel transversely to the detector's longitudinal axis.",

Extra energy is the sum of energies represented by all unused hit clusters that are time-coincident with the muon track. The hits include clusters rejected during \u03c0 0 reconstruction, clusters lying close to the muon but not used by the tracking algorithm, and all unused clusters that lie within a radius of 30 cm about the primary vertex. Also included in E extra are ionizations remote from the primary vertex that are induced by scatters of slow neutrons released by breakup of the struck nucleus. Figure 4 shows the energy E extra that is included in the neutrino estimation, for events without (Fig. 4a) and with ( Fig. 4b) reconstructed protons. The distributions have similar shapes and are adequately described by the GENIE-based simulation. The sum of final-state energies as in Eq. 5is used to reconstruct the neutrino energy, E \u03bd . Distributions of reconstructed-E \u03bd minus true-E \u03bd as evaluated by the reference MC are found to be symmetric and have means consistent with zero [64]. This E \u03bd estimator is used throughout the analysis for both the data and simulation. Figure 5 shows the distributions of calculated E \u03bd for events without a reconstructed proton (Fig. 5a) and for events that have at least one reconstructed proton ( Fig. 5b). The errors shown with the data points are purely statistical. The simulation predictions are in rough agreement with the data for both distributions. The neutrino energy distribution for the full signal sample has an average neutrino energy of 5.25 GeV (4.4 GeV for events with E \u03bd below 10 GeV). The RMS width of the MC (reconstructed true) distribution for E \u03bd is 0.42 GeV.",

This Michel sideband (1803 events) has abundant charged-meson(s) background but also contains a sizable \u03c0 0 +meson(s) contribution. There are very few zeromeson events in the Michel sideband. In the fourth sideband, the muon is accompanied by a second reconstructed track which has a low likelihood score for the proton hypothesis (3933 events). This low-protonscore sideband is also predicted to be mostly composed of charged meson(s) plus \u03c0 0 +meson(s) backgrounds but with their apportionment differing somewhat from that in the Michel-tag sideband. The estimated compositions of the latter sidebands after background tuning by the fit-to-sidebands described below, are displayed as component histograms in Figs. 7a and 7b.  (Fig. 7a) and for the low-protonscore sideband (Fig. 7b). The MC predictions are brought into agreement with the data by adjustments of component background levels as determined by the simultaneous fit to all four sidebands of the analysis.",

The fit procedure varies the normalizations of the charged-meson(s), zero-meson, and \u03c0 0 +meson(s) categories to minimize the total \u03c7 2 in all sidebands at once. The MC estimates of other background and of residual signal content of the sidebands are held fixed. The \u03c7 2 uses 50 bins for each of the Michel-tag and low-proton-score sidebands, 30 bins for the high-side M \u03b3\u03b3 sideband, and 6 bins for the low-side M \u03b3\u03b3 sideband. The total of 136 bins, each with good data statistics, yields robust constraints on the background normalizations. The fit improves the \u03c7 2 in each of the four sidebands. The \u03c7 2 over all sidebands changes from 956.3 to 216.8 for 133 degrees of freedom. Figure 6 shows the \u03b3\u03b3 invariant mass distribution for the data compared to the GENIE MC prediction before and after the sideband fit.

At higher momentum or energy bins the detector response uncertainty diminishes and stays with a range of 3% to 7%. For most bins of either distribution, finite data statistics gives a larger uncertainty than does any single systematic category. The principal interaction cross-section model (GENIE) contributes fractional uncertainties in the range of 4% to 10% for both variables, reflecting sizable uncertainties that arise with the modeling of neutrino-nucleon pion production. Uncertainties arising from the FSI model are associated with parameters in the GENIE framework; the largest of which is a 50% uncertainty associated with pion chargeexchange cross sections [71].

III A), the cross section is flux-integrated over the range 1.5 GeV \u2264 E \u03bd < 20 GeV and the muon production angle is restricted to \u2264 25 \u2022 . The general shape of d\u03c3/dp \u00b5 is strongly influenced by the \u03bd flux spectrum; the cross section peaks between 2.0 and 2.5 GeV and falls off rapidly as p \u00b5 increases from 3.0 GeV/c to beyond 6.0 GeV/c. The GENIE-based simulation (solidline curve) is in agreement with the data in all bins to within 1\u03c3 of the statistical plus systematic error on the data distribution. The muon differential cross section can be compared to similar measurements for \u03bd \u00b5 -CC(\u03c0 + ) and\u03bd \u00b5 -CC(\u03c0 0 ) obtained with MINERvA -see Fig. 7 of Ref. [13]. The spectral peaks are observed to nearly coincide for all three data sets, even though the absolute cross sections are rather different. Differences in cross section magnitudes are to be expected, since the three pion production channels differ in their isospin compositions and in the role played by interferences between vector current and axial vector current contributions, the latter being constructive in the \u03bd \u00b5 channels and destructive in the\u03bd \u00b5 channel. The GENIE-based prediction in Fig. 9 is less sensitive to pion FSI than are the corresponding predictions for \u03bd \u00b5 -CC(\u03c0 + ) and\u03bd \u00b5 -CC(\u03c0 0 ). This is because a full accounting of FSI alterations of pionic charge and multiplicity predicts approximately equal feed-in versus feedout rates for channel (1). The GENIE prediction in Fig. 9 is shown with FSI included; the FSI model has contributed a downwards shift in the predicted distribution of \u223c 4% in the vicinity of the peak.",

In NuWro the baryon resonance region extends to W < 1.6 GeV; \u2206(1232) production is calculated using the Adler model [72,73], with nonresonant pion production added incoherently as a fraction of DIS, where DIS is formulated according to the Bodek-Yang model [55]. For its FSI treatment, NuWro uses the Salcedo-Oset model [74] in a hadronic cascade formalism that includes nuclear-medium corrections. Figure 9 shows that for d\u03c3/dp \u00b5 , NuWro predicts a cross section that is lower through the peak than either the data or the GENIE-based prediction, however it comes into agreement with the data and with GENIE at higher p \u00b5 values.

The GENIE prediction (sum of histograms) exceeds the data for (\u03b8\u00b5 < 5\u00b0) and falls below the data for (\u03b8\u00b5 > 12\u00b0). The relative contributions from \u2206 + production, higher-mass N * production, and nonresonant \u03c0 0 production show little variation over the measured range of \u03b8\u00b5. Figure 11 shows the differential cross section as a function of polar angle, \u03b8 \u00b5 , with respect to the neutrino beam. The \u03b8 \u00b5 distribution peaks near 9 \u2022 and then decreases gradually at larger angles. The cross section is obtained from 0 \u2022 to 25 \u2022 , at which point the diminishing acceptance for muons to reach MINOS precludes further measurement. In contrast to the good match between data and the reference MC observed for d\u03c3/dp \u00b5 , significant differences are found with the generator predictions d\u03c3/d\u03b8 \u00b5 . The GENIE-based prediction overshoots the data below 5 \u2022 , while it consistently falls below the data for angles exceeding 12 \u2022 . Milder forms of these shape disagreements can be discerned in d\u03c3/d\u03b8 \u00b5 + for\u03bd \u00b5 -CC(\u03c0 0 ) (data lies below GENIE prediction at very forward angles) and in d\u03c3/d\u03b8 \u00b5 \u2212 for \u03bd \u00b5 -CC(\u03c0 + ) (data fall-off at large angles is more gradual than predicted) -see Fig.  6 of Ref. [13]. Since muon production angle is measured with an RMS resolution 2 mrad, the discrepancy suggests a shortfall with the neutrino-carbon scattering model. These disagreements are related to data-MC disagreements observed at very low and at high Q 2 , as discussed in Sec. IX. 12. Pion kinetic energy differential cross section. Predictions are shown for GENIE and NuWro; GENIE predictions are displayed without and with pion FSI modeling (dotted-line, solid-line distributions respectively). The data exhibits a slightly stronger enhancement at T \u03c0 0 \u223c 100 MeV than is predicted by the simulation. The enhancement is attributed to intranuclear charge-exchange reactions \u03c0 + \u2192 \u03c0 0 fed by \u03c0 + production from \u03bd\u00b5-CC(\u03c0 + ) interactions [11].",

The NuWro prediction lies everywhere below the data, while GENIE generally reproduces the data normalization and shape. The data exhibits a rate enhancement in the region T \u03c0 0 < 100 MeV, a trend predicted by the pion FSI model used by GENIE [58]. This effect was predicted by U. Mosel using a GiBUU simulation of MINERvA data [11]. The effect is attributed to event feed-in to channel (1) resulting from intranuclear charge-exchange involving \u03c0 + \u2192 \u03c0 0 ; the latter processes are fueled by the large \u03bd \u00b5 -CC(\u03c0 + ) cross section. It is also pointed out that the T \u03c0 0 region around 240 MeV incurs depletion from pion absorption. Figure 13 shows the relative contributions of component pion scattering processes to d\u03c3/dT \u03c0 0 as invoked by the GENIE FSI model. The data and MC distributions are shown area-normalized to each other in order to elicit shape differences. According to the GENIE model, \u03c0 0 inelastic scattering is the most probable FSI however charge exchange \u03c0 + \u2192 \u03c0 0 contributes very significantly in the lowest bins of kinetic energy. Figure 13 suggests that modest tuning of pion FSI cross section may improve the data-MC agreement. The differential cross section for pion production angle with respect to the beam direction is shown in Fig. 14. The cross section shows most \u03c0 0 s to be produced in the Lab forward hemisphere with angles around 35 \u2022 being most probable. The GENIE-based simulation is in good agreement with the data over the entire angular range while NuWro falls below the data in the region of the peak. The peak location and shape for d\u03c3/d\u03b8 \u03c0 0 are similar to those obtained previously for \u03bd \u00b5 -CC(\u03c0 + ) and\u03bd \u00b5 -CC(\u03c0 0 ) [13]; this outcome was anticipated by a GiBUU simulation of MINERvA 's low-energy exposure [11].",

            "text": "IX. \u03c3(E\u03bd ), d\u03c3/dQ 2 , and d\u03c3/dWexp Figure 15 shows the channel (1) cross section as function of neutrino energy, \u03c3(E \u03bd ), for events with hadronic invariant mass restricted to W exp < 1.8 GeV. The cross section rise from threshold and its value for E \u03bd \u2265 6 GeV are described on average by the reference simulation, with NuWro predicting a cross section of similar shape and slightly lower magnitude. According to GENIE, \u2206 production is the dominant process for E \u03bd < 3 GeV. Above 4 GeV, the contributions from \u2206 production, N * production, and nonresonant pion production become nearly independent of E \u03bd with relative proportions that are roughly 35:15:40 [64]. The cross section of Fig. 15 can be readily compared to the pion production cross sections reported in Ref. [13]. The measured cross sections become nearly independent of neutrino energy around E \u03bd = 7 GeV. At that point the relative strengths for \u03bd \u00b5 -CC(\u03c0 0 ):\u03bd \u00b5 -CC(\u03c0 + ):\u03bd \u00b5 -CC(\u03c0 0 ) in units of 10 \u221240 cm 2 per nucleon, according to the measured cross sections, approximately follow the ratios 22:80:19. The squared four-momentum transfer from the lepton system, Q 2 , is calculated using Eq. (6), which incorporates both lepton and hadron information (via Eq. (5)). Figure 16 shows the differential cross section versus Q 2 determined by this analysis. The data exhibits a rate reduction at Q 2 below 0.2 GeV 2 larger than that predicted by the GENIE-based MC. A similar data-MC disagreement was observed at low Q 2 in the MINERvA\u03bd \u00b5 -CC(\u03c0 0 ) sample [13], and data suppressions at low-Q 2 for \u2206-enriched event samples have been reported by Mini-BooNE [22,75] and by MINOS [76]. On the other hand, the reference simulation falls below the data in the region Q 2 > 0.4 GeV 2 . From Eq. (6) it is clear that these data-MC differences are related to those in Fig. 10 for muons produced at small and large muon polar angles. Note that above 0.2 GeV 2 , NuWro predicts a flatter spectrum than does GENIE and thereby trends more similarly to the data; however the absolute scale for d\u03c3/dQ 2 predicted by NuWro is clearly too low. For neutrino quasielastic scattering in nuclei such as carbon, it is well-known that Pauli blocking produces a turnover of event rate at low-Q 2 [77]. Additionally it is estimated on the basis of RPA and 2p2h that multinucleon-nucleon correlations give rise to low-Q 2 suppression and high-Q 2 enhancement of rate in the case of CCQE-like scattering [60,78,79]. For \u00b5 + \u2206(1232) channels produced in carbon-like nuclei modeled as a Fermi gas, the effect of Pauli blocking has been calculated in Ref. [80]. Pauli suppression is shown to be confined to Q 2 < 0.2 GeV 2 and to W < 1.4 GeV. Thus Pauli blocking of \u2206 and N * states, which is not included in the reference simulation, plausibly accounts for a modest portion of the low Q 2 suppression exhibited by the data in Fig. 16. It is possible that NN-correlation effects of the kind targeted by RPA calculations may also be present in neutrino-nucleus baryon resonance production, however this has yet to be demonstrated with a calculation. If the calculation of Ref. [60], which is for quasielastic scattering (and not baryon resonance production), is indicative of the strength and Q 2 dependence of RPA distortion, then RPA in the absence of 2p2h is conceivably capable, in conjunction with Pauli blocking, of generating the data-MC disagreement shown in Fig. 16. Admittedly, the latter scenario is speculative and it may be at odds with a recent theoretical treatment that shows RPA correlations to have reduced effect in calculations based on a realistic nuclear ground state [81]. Another possibility, recognized for many years [80], is that the normaliza-tion or functional form of the axial-vector form factors of neutrino-nucleus scattering may need modification. Unfortunately there is a dearth of theoretical guidance on how to approach this.  Figure 17 displays the reaction composition of d\u03c3/dQ 2 as predicted by the GENIE-based MC. Baryon-resonance production, especially \u2206(1232) production, is expected to dominate at low Q 2 . However as Q 2 is increased, nonresonant pion production gradually overtakes the baryon resonance contributions to become the dominant single process for Q 2 beyond 1.0 GeV 2 .",

From a different perspective, namely that of weak-interaction hadronic currents, d\u03c3/dQ 2 can be considered as the sum of vector and axial-vector terms, plus the VA interference term which is constructive for the case of CC neutrino scattering. For incident E \u03bd of one to few GeV, VA interference may exceed the vector contribution however its presence diminishes very rapidly at higher E \u03bd [83]. And of course, the phase space available to the final state grows with E \u03bd . The interplay of these effects can give rise to an E \u03bd dependence for d\u03c3/dQ 2 . To elicit such a dependence, determinations of d\u03c3/dQ 2 have been carried out for two different energy ranges, namely 1.5 < E \u03bd < 4 GeV and 4 < E \u03bd < 10 GeV. Figure 18 shows d\u03c3/dQ 2 for signal distributions separated into the two energy ranges according to reconstructed E \u03bd . The difference in the rate of falloff with increasing Q 2 between the two samples is evident. ",

The average displacement is estimated by imposing an overall shift on the prediction and calculating the \u03c7 2 with respect to data for each trial. A shift of 20 MeV gives the minimum \u03c7 2 , improving the \u03c7 2 /d.o.f. from 6.9 to 1.8. As indicated by Eq. 7from which W exp is calculated, a portion of this shift may reflect the data-MC disagreement in Q 2 exhibited by Figs. 16 and 17. According to simulation trials, the Q 2 offsets can introduce shifts of up to 10 MeV in the distribution of W exp . Equation 7is founded on the unrealistic assumption that target nucleons are struck while at rest, and this makes the MC predictions sensitive to shortfalls in modeling of interactions on nuclei. The differences in modeling approaches used by the GENIE and NuWro neutrino generators provide some perspectives. Alteration of Fermi-motion modeling and inclusion of in-medium modification of the \u2206(232) resonance [82], may generate offsets of \u223c 5 MeV. A shift of similar magnitude may also arise from constructive interference between the \u2206 and nonresonant pion production amplitudes [16]. The latter mechanism is not treated by either generator.  (7). The data peaks in the vicinity of the \u2206(1232) + resonance. The reference simulation roughly matches the data rate, but the predicted shape is shifted towards higher Wexp values relative to the data.",

For the first subsample, designated hereafter as the p\u03c0 0 sample, the signal definition requirement W exp < 1.8 GeV is left unchanged. For the second subsample, designated as the \u2206 enriched-subsample the W exp range is restricted to W exp < 1.4 GeV. The added requirements amount to a new signal definition for each subsample, consequently the procedures used for the signal sample of channel (1), namely background fitting, background subtraction, unfolding, and efficiency correction, have been carried out anew for each subsample. For either subsample, the in-variant mass, M p\u03c0 0 , can be calculated from the reconstructed \u03c0 0 and the leading proton. The resolution (RMS width) for M p\u03c0 0 is 0.10 GeV. Curves predicted by the reference simulation show that hadronic FSI tends to broaden and mute baryon-resonance structures.

In general, the decay angular distributions of produced \u2206 states are sensitive to production mechanisms and to interferences among different partial wave amplitudes, hence measurements for other \u2206 charge states can provide new tests of resonance production models [16,36,37]. In this work the produced p\u03c0 0 systems of the \u2206-enriched subsample are examined for deviations from isotropic decay that may reflect polarization effects. The decay angles for \u03c0 0 mesons emitted in the p\u03c0 0 rest frame are calculated using formalism suited to this measurement [72,84]. The coordinate system used in the p\u03c0 0 rest frame is established event-by-event as follows: The four-momenta of the neu-trino, muon, pion and proton are Lorentz-boosted into the p\u03c0 rest frame. In that frame, the axes of a righthanded coordinate system are defined with the z-axis along the momentum transfer direction ( p \u03bd \u2212 p \u00b5 ), the y-axis along the production plane normal ( p \u03bd \u00d7 p \u00b5 ), and x-axis along the direction of the cross-product (\u0177 \u00d7\u1e91). The zenith angle \u03b8 is the angle between the pion momentum, p \u03c0 , and the z-axis. The azimuthal angle \u03c6 is the angle between the projection of p \u03c0 on the x \u2212 y plane and x-axis.",

For the predictions by the neutrino generators, the two-body decays of baryon resonances, including \u2206 + \u2192 p + \u03c0 0 , are generated isotropically in their rest frames. (Exception is made in MINERvA's GENIE implementation for \u2206 ++ decays, where polarization (for cos(\u03b8)) at 50% of the strength prescribed by the Rein-Sehgal model is used [14].) According to the GENIE, p\u03c0 0 systems that do not experience FSI would distribute fairly isotropically. In the presence of FSI however a peak develops in the backwards hemisphere for cos(\u03b8) < \u22120.5 as shown by the dotted-line and solid-line curves in Fig. 22a. A similar trend is predicted by NuWro, and indeed the data shows a mild upswing as cos(\u03b8) approaches -1.0. This peaking in the backwards direction is a pion FSI effect. As can be seen in Fig. 12, FSI enhances the low-momentum component of the pion spectrum. When slow pions are boosted to the p\u03c0 0 rest frame (the boost direction in the Lab being roughly aligned with the direction of proton momenta), they are projected into the backwards hemisphere where they are anti-aligned with the protons and with the boost direction which defines the z-axis.",

While the absolute event rates in the very forward hemisphere are sensitive to the value set as the proton threshold requirement (T p > 100 MeV), the tendency for the data to exceed the predictions throughout the forward hemisphere is invariant to changes in this threshold setting. The overall trend in data versus prediction based upon isotropic decay is suggestive of weak polarization excitation of density matrix elements associated with a Y \u00b11 2 (\u03b8, \u03c6) angular dependence [16]. Figure 22b compares the data and simulation prediction for the distribution of azimuthal angle \u03c6. Here, FSI is predicted to give an overall reduction in rate (as is predicted for cos(\u03b8)), however neither FSI nor details of the subsample selection introduce any angular distortions; the shape of the \u03c6 distribution is predicted to be flat -consistent with isotropy -by both event generators. To zeroth order the data is also isotropic, however there are deviations at the < 2 \u03c3 level that suggest a left-right asymmetry relative to the X-Z plane, with 0 \u2022 < \u03c6 < 180 \u2022 defining the \"Right\" side of the plane. In summary, the data -when compared to simulations based upon isotropic decays for produced \u2206 + statesshow modest deviations from isotropy with respect to both cos(\u03b8) and \u03c6. These anisotropies can be quantified using two test statistics, namely a forward/backward, data-vs-MC, ratio-of-ratios to express asymmetry about the plane at cos(\u03b8) = 0.0, and a left/right, data-vs-MC, ratio-of-ratios to express asymmetry with respect to \u03c6 = 180 \u2022 . These ratios are akin to the asymmetry parameters reported by the ANL bubble chamber experiment [18]. Let N F (B) and N L(R) designate number of events in forward (backward) and left (right) hemispheres respectively, and let R F/B and R L/R designate N F /N B and N L /N R respectively; then Here, the prediction of the GENIE-based simulation is taken to represent isotropy, and anisotropy is gauged in terms of a ratio-of-ratios deviation from unity. Thus the data exhibits a \u223c 2 \u03c3 anisotropy that favors pion emission into the forward hemisphere, and a \u223c 1 \u03c3 anisotropy that favors emission into the left hemisphere with 180 \u2022 < \u03c6 < 360 \u2022 . Comparing to the asymmetries observed with \u2206 ++ states produced in events of the ANL bubble chamber experiment (with 0.5 < E \u03bd < 6 GeV) [18], the anisotropies in cos(\u03b8) and \u03c6 are of comparable magnitudes and of opposite and same sign, respectively.",

Differential cross sections are presented for muon variables p \u00b5 and \u03b8 \u00b5 and for T \u03c0 and \u03b8 \u03c0 of the final-state \u03c0 0 . The per event E \u03bd is estimated from muon kinematics plus a sum over calorimetric measures of final-state hadronic energy, and cross sections are thereby determined as functions of E \u03bd , Q 2 , and W exp . From the signal sample, events having a proton above the reconstruction threshold (T p > 100 MeV) are selected. Differential cross sections in proton-\u03c0 0 invariant mass are reported for events with W exp < 1.8 GeV, and also for events with the further selection W exp < 1.4 GeV. Using events of the latter subsample, the angular emission of pions in the p\u03c0 0 rest frame is examined for evidence of polarization, and differential cross sections for zenith-angle cos(\u03b8) and for azimuthal angle \u03c6 are obtained.",
