            "text": "The flavour structure of the weak interaction between quarks is described by the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix [1,2]. In particular, the tree-level decays of charmed particles depend on the matrix elements V ud , V us , V cd and V cs . The hierarchy of the CKM matrix elements becomes evident using the approximate Wolfenstein parametrisation, which is based on the expansion in powers of the small parameter \u03bb \u2248 0.23 with |V ud | \u2248 |V cs | \u2248 1 \u2212 \u03bb 2 /2 and |V us | \u2248 |V cd | \u2248 \u03bb [3,4]. Tree-level decays depending on both V us and V cd matrix elements are known as doubly Cabibbo-suppressed (DCS) decays. They have small branching fractions compared to the Cabibbo-favoured (CF) and the singly Cabibbo-suppressed (SCS) decays [5]. A systematic study of the relative contributions of DCS and CF diagrams to decays of charm baryons could shed light onto the role of the nonspectator quark, and in particular Pauli interference [6]. Such studies would be helpful for a better understanding of the lifetime hierarchy of charm baryons [6][7][8][9]. So far only one DCS charm-baryon decay, \u039b + c \u2192 pK + \u03c0 \u2212 , has been observed [10,11]. This article reports the first observation of the DCS decay \u039e + c \u2192 p\u03c6 with \u03c6 \u2192 K + K \u2212 , hereafter referred to as the signal decay channel. 1 The leading-order diagram for the \u039e + c \u2192 p\u03c6 decay is shown in figure 1. The branching fraction of the signal decay channel is measured relative to the branching fraction of the SCS decay channel \u039e + c \u2192 pK \u2212 \u03c0 + ,",

The minimum distance of a track to a primary vertex (PV), the impact parameter (IP), is measured with a resolution of (15 + 29/p T ) \u00b5m, where p T is the component of the momentum transverse to the beam, in GeV/c. Different types of charged hadrons are distinguished using information from two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors [16]. Photons, electrons, and hadrons are identified by a system consisting of scintillating-pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic and a hadronic calorimeter. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers [17]. The online event selection is performed by a trigger [18], which consists of a hardware stage, based on information from the calorimeter and the muon systems, followed by a software stage, which applies a full event reconstruction. At the hardware trigger stage, the events are required to have a muon with high p T or a hadron, photon or electron with high transverse energy in the calorimeters. The software trigger requires a two-, three-or four-track secondary vertex with a significant displacement from any primary pp interaction vertex. At least one charged particle must have a transverse momentum p T > 1.6 GeV/c and be inconsistent with originating from any PV.",

Only pions, protons, and kaons with an impact parameter \u03c7 2 IP in excess of 9 with respect to all reconstructed PVs are taken into consideration for subsequent analysis. The \u03c7 2 IP quantity is calculated as the difference in \u03c7 2 of the PV fit with and without the particle in question. The momenta of the reconstructed final-state particles are required to be in the range 3.2-150 GeV/c for the mesons, and in the range 10-100 GeV/c for the proton. The reconstructed tracks must pass particle-identification (PID) requirements based on information from the RICH detectors, the calorimeter, and the muon stations [27]. The PID requirements are loose for mesons and much tighter for protons, to suppress \u03c0 + and K + misidentified as protons. The three tracks must form a common vertex. The selected \u039e + c candidates must have the rapidity (y) and transverse momentum 2.0 < y < 4. The average number of visible interactions per beam-crossing is 1.7 [13]. The candidate is associated to the PV with the smallest value of \u03c7 2 IP . In order to evaluate the candidate \u039e + c decay time and the two-body masses for the particles in the final state, a constrained fit is performed, requiring the \u039e + c candidate to have originated from its associated PV and have a mass equal to its known value [28]. The proper decay time is required to be between 0.55 and 1.5 ps to reduce the fraction of baryons coming from b-hadron decays. The b-hadron component is also suppressed by the requirement on the \u03c7 2 IP value of the reconstructed baryon to be less than 32. The masses of the pK \u2212 h + combinations are calculated without the mass constraint. They are required to be in the range 2.42 to 2.51 GeV/c 2 for the \u039e + c candidates.",
