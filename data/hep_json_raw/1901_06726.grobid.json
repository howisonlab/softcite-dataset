            "text": "A search for supersymmetry is presented based on events with at least one photon, jets, and large missing transverse momentum produced in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 and were recorded at the LHC with the CMS detector in 2016. The analysis characterizes signal-like events by categorizing the data into various signal regions based on the number of jets, the number of b-tagged jets, and the missing transverse momentum. No significant excess of events is observed with respect to the expectations from standard model processes. Limits are placed on the gluino and top squark pair production cross sections using several simplified models of supersymmetric particle production with gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking. Depending on the model and the mass of the nextto-lightest supersymmetric particle, the production of gluinos with masses as large as 2120 GeV and the production of top squarks with masses as large as 1230 GeV are excluded at 95% confidence level.",

            "text": "The standard model (SM) of particle physics successfully describes many phenomena, but lacks several necessary elements to provide a complete description of nature, including a source for the relic abundance of dark matter (DM) [1,2] in the universe. In addition, the SM must resort to fine tuning [3][4][5][6] to explain the hierarchy between the Planck mass scale and the electroweak scale set by the vacuum expectation value of the Higgs field, the existence of which was recently confirmed by the observation of the Higgs boson (H) [7,8]. Supersymmetry (SUSY) [9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16] is an extension of the SM that can provide both a viable DM candidate and additional particles that inherently cancel large quantum corrections to the Higgs boson mass-squared term from the SM fields. e-mail: cms-publication-committee-chair@cern.ch Supersymmetric models predict a bosonic superpartner for each SM fermion and a fermionic superpartner for each SM boson; each new particle's spin differs from that of its SM partner by half a unit. SUSY also includes a second Higgs doublet. New colored states, such as gluinos ( g) and top squarks ( t), the superpartners of the gluon and the top quark, respectively, are expected to have masses on the order of 1 TeV to avoid fine tuning in the SM Higgs boson mass-squared term. In models that conserve R-parity [17], each superpartner carries a conserved quantum number that requires superpartners to be produced in pairs and causes the lightest SUSY particle (LSP) to be stable. The stable LSP can serve as a DM candidate.",

In GMSB models, the gaugino masses are expected to be proportional to the size of their fundamental couplings. This includes the superpartner of the graviton, the gravitino ( G), whose mass is proportional to M SB /M Pl , where M SB represents the scale of the SUSY breaking interactions and M Pl is the Planck scale where gravity is expected to become strong. GMSB permits a significantly lower symmetry-breaking scale than, e.g., gravity mediation, and therefore generically predicts that the G is the LSP [18][19][20], with a mass often much less than 1 GeV. Correspondingly, the next-to-LSP (NLSP) is typically a neutralino, a superposition of the superpartners of the neutral bosons. The details of the quantum numbers of the NLSP play a large part in determining the phenomenology of GMSB models, including the relative frequencies of the Higgs bosons, Z bosons, and photons produced in the NLSP decay.",

Depending on the topology, these jets can arise from either light-flavored We study four simplified models [21][22][23][24][25]; example diagrams depicting these models are shown in Fig. 1. Three models involve gluino pair production (prefixed with T5), and one model involves top squark pair production (prefixed with T6). In the T5qqqqHG model, each gluino decays to a pair of light-flavored quarks (qq) and a neutralino ( \u03c7 0 1 ). The T5bbbbZG and T5ttttZG models are similar to T5qqqqHG, except that the each pair of lightflavored quarks is replaced by a pair of bottom quarks (bb) or a pair of top quarks (tt), respectively. In the T5qqqqHG model, the \u03c7 0 1 decays either to an SM Higgs boson and a G or to a photon and a G. The \u03c7 0 1 \u2192 H G branching fraction is assumed to be 50%, and the smallest \u03c7 0 1 mass considered is 127 GeV. In the T5bbbbZG and T5ttttZG models, the neutralinos decay to Z G and \u03b3 G with equal probability. The T6ttZG model considers top squark pair production, with each top squark decaying into a top quark and a neutralino. The neutralino can then decay with equal probability to a photon and a G or to a Z boson and a G. For the models involving the decay \u03c7 0 1 \u2192 Z G, we probe \u03c7 0 1 masses down to 10 GeV. All decays of SUSY particles are assumed to be prompt. In all models, the mass m G is fixed to be 1 GeV, to be consistent with other published results. For the parameter space explored here, the kinematic properties do not depend strongly on the exact value of m G .",

We also include additional signal regions that exploit high jet multiplicities for sensitivity to high-mass gluino models, and we rely more on observed data for the background estimations.

Briefly, a cylindrical superconducting solenoid with an inner diameter of 6 m provides a 3.8 T axial magnetic field. Within the cylindrical volume are a silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL), and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter (HCAL). The tracking detectors cover the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 2.5. The ECAL and HCAL, each composed of a barrel and two endcap sections, cover |\u03b7| < 3.0. Forward calorimeters extend the coverage to 3.0 < |\u03b7| < 5.0. Muons are detected within |\u03b7| < 2.4 by gas-ionization detectors embedded in the steel flux-return yoke outside the solenoid. The detector is nearly hermetic, permitting accurate measurements of p miss T . The CMS trigger is described in Ref. [33].",

For example, in events with highp T top quarks, the top quark decay products will be collimated, forcing the b jet to be closer to the charged lepton. In this case, the lepton is more likely to fail the isolation requirements. This background is estimated by studying control regions in both data and simulation, obtained by requiring both a wellidentified photon and a light lepton (e, \u03bc).

In all control regions where a single light lepton is required, the dominant SM processes that contribute are W\u03b3 and tt\u03b3 . Lost-muon and hadronic tau events are estimated using \u03bc\u03b3 control regions, while lost-electron events are estimated using e\u03b3 control regions. In each control region, exactly one electron or muon is required and the isolated track veto for the selected lepton flavor is removed. In order to reduce the effect of signal contamination and to increase the fraction of SM events in the control sample, events are only selected if the m T of the leptonp miss T system is less than 100 GeV. In SM background events with a single lepton and p miss T , the m T of the system is constrained by the mass of the W boson; this is not the case for signal events, because of the presence of gravitinos. All other kinematic variable requirements for each signal region are applied to the corresponding control regions. Transfer factors are derived using simulated W\u03b3 +jets and tt\u03b3 processes, which determine the average number of events expected in the signal region for each e\u03b3 or \u03bc\u03b3 event observed in the control region. The Z\u03b3 events in which the Z boson decays leptonically have a negligible contribution to the transfer factors. The transfer factors applied to the \u03bc\u03b3 control regions account for both lost-\u03bc events and \u03c4 h events. They are denoted by the symbol T \u03bc,\u03c4 and are typically in the range 0.7 < T \u03bc,\u03c4 < 1.0. The transfer factors applied to e\u03b3 events account for only the lost-e events. They are denoted by the symbol T e and are typically in the range 0.3 < T e < 0.6. The transfer factors are parameterized versus N jets , N b-jets , and p miss T ; however, for p miss T > 150 GeV, T is found to be independent of p miss T . The parameterization of the transfer  bins. In each of these regions, the first bin corresponds to 100 < p miss T < 200 GeV, which belongs to a control region. The remaining bins correspond to the signal regions in Table 1 factors is validated using simulation by treating e\u03b3 or \u03bc\u03b3 events like data and comparing the predicted lost-lepton and \u03c4 h event yields to the true simulated event yields in the signal regions. This comparison is shown in Fig. 2. The prediction in each signal region is N pred = \u03a3 i N i T ,i , where = e, \u03bc and i ranges from 1 to n, where n is the number of transfer factors that contribute in a given signal region. The dominant uncertainty in the lost-lepton background predictions arises from the limited numbers of events in the e\u03b3 and \u03bc\u03b3 control regions. These uncertainties are modeled in the final statistical interpretations as a gamma distribution whose shape parameter is set by the observed number of events and whose scale parameter is the average transfer factor for that bin. Other systematic uncertainties in the determination of the transfer factors include the statistical uncertainty from the limited number of simulated events, which is typically 5-10% but can be as large as 20%, as well as uncertainties in the jet energy corrections, PDFs, renormalization (\u03bc R ) and factorization (\u03bc F ) scales, and simulation correction factors. The uncertainties in \u03bc R and \u03bc F are obtained by varying each value independently by factors of 0.5 and 2.0 [65,66]. Simulation correction factors are used to account for differences between the observed data and modeling of b-tagging efficiencies, b jet misidentification, and lepton reconstruction efficiencies in simulation. One of the largest uncertainties, apart from the statistical uncertainty in the data control regions and the simulation, comes from mismodeling of photons which are collinear with electrons, which has a 12% effect on the lost-lepton prediction.",

Given a misidentification rate, which relates events with an erroneously identified photon to events with a well-identified electron, the photon background can be estimated from a single-electron (zero-photon) control region.

As explained in the previous section, in addition to all of the signal region selections, events are required to satisfy m T (e, p miss T ) < 100 GeV. To extrapolate from the event yields in the single-electron control regions to the event yields for the misidentified photon background in the signal regions, we derive a misidentification rate f = N \u03b3 /N e using a combination of simulation and data. The misidentification rate is determined as a function of the electron p T and the multiplicity Q mult of charged-particle tracks from the primary vertex in a region around the electron candidate. The charged-track multiplicity is computed by counting the number of charged PF candidates (electrons, muons, hadrons) in the jet closest to the electron candidate. If there is no jet within \u0394R < 0.3 of the electron candidate, Q mult is set to zero. A typical event in the single-electron control region has a Q mult of 3-4. The electron p T and Q mult dependence of the misidentification rate is derived using simulated W+jets and tt+jets events. The misidentification rate is on average 1-2%, but can be as low as 0.5% for events with high Q mult .",

A nuisance parameter refers to a variable not of interest in this search, such as the effect of parton distribution function uncertainties in a background prediction. The nuisance parameters are constrained by observed data in the fit. The uncertainties in the predicted signal yield arise from the uncertainties in renormalization and factorization scales, ISR modeling, jet energy scale, b-tagging efficiency and misidentification rate, corrections to simulation, limited numbers of simulated events, and the integrated luminosity measurement [26]. The largest uncertainty comes from the ISR modeling; it ranges from 4 to 30% depending on the signal region and the signal parameters, taking higher values for regions with large N jets or for signals with \u0394m \u2248 0. Here, \u0394m is the difference in mass between the gluino or squark and its decay products, e.g. \u0394m = m g \u2212 (m \u03c7 0 1 + 2m t ) for the T5ttttZG model when on-shell top quarks are produced.

For all models except T5qqqqHG, when the NLSP mass drops below the mass of the Z boson, the kinematics of the NLSP decay require the Z boson to be far off-shell. As the Z boson mass is forced to be lower, the LSP will carry a larger fraction of the momentum of the NLSP, producing larger p miss T . This causes a slight increase in the sensitivity when the NLSP mass is near the Z boson mass. While a similar effect would happen for the T5qqqqHG model, the simulation used here does not probe the region of parameter space where the Higgs boson would be forced to have a mass far off-shell. Similarly, the limits for top squark production improve slightly at very high m  T . Background yields from the standard model processes are predicted using simulation and data control regions. The observed event yields are found to be consistent with expectations from the standard model processes within the uncertainties.",

Four such models are studied, three of which involve gluino pair production and one of which involves top squark pair production. All models assume a gauge-mediated supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking scenario, in which the lightest SUSY particle is a gravitino ( G). We consider scenarios in which the gluino decays to a neutralino \u03c7 0 1 and a pair of light-flavor quarks (T5qqqqHG), bottom quarks (T5bbbbZG), or top quarks (T5ttttZG). In the T5qqqqHG model, the \u03c7 0 1 decays with equal probability either to a photon and a G or to a Higgs boson and a G. In the T5bbbbZG and T5ttttZG models, the \u03c7 0 1 decays with equal probability either to a photon and a G or to a Z boson and a G. In the top squark pair production model (T6ttZG), top squarks decay to a top quark and \u03c7 0 1 , and the \u03c7 0 1 decays with equal probability either to a photon and a G or to a Z boson and a G.
