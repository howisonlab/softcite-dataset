The total live time used in this analysis is 403.1 days from June 2016 to August 2018. With NLDBD-optimized event selection criteria, we obtain a fiducial mass of 219 kg of natural xenon. The accumulated xenon exposure is 242 kg\u2022yr, or equivalently 22.2 kg\u2022yr of 136 Xe exposure. At the region around 136 Xe decay Q-value of 2458 keV, the energy resolution of PandaX-II is 4.2%. We find no evidence of NLDBD in PandaX-II and establish a lower limit for decay half-life of 2.4 \u00d710 23 yr at the 90% confidence level, which corresponds to an effective Majorana neutrino mass m \u03b2\u03b2 < (1.3 \u2212 3.5) eV. This is the first NLDBD result reported from a dual-phase xenon experiment.",

This process is a direct evidence that neutrinos are their own anti-particles, i.e., Majorana Fermions. It also violates lepton number conservation since the emitted electrons are not accompanied by corresponding electron anti-neutrinos. NLDBD is clearly a physical process beyond the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics [1]. The SM-allowed double beta decay process with two electron anti-neutrinos emitted has been observed in a dozen or so isotopes, but NLDBD has not been convincingly observed yet.",

CANDLES-III [7], GERDA [2], CUORE [8], and KamLAND-Zen [5] experiments have recently established the most stringent half-life lower limit respectively for 40 Ca, 76 Ge, 130 Te, and 136 Xe decaying into the ground state of their daughters.

The sensitive volume is defined by a cylinder of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) reflectors of inner diameter 646 mm and two sets of photomultiplier tube (PMT) arrays at the top and bottom. The drift/extraction/amplification field in the TPC is exerted by the cathode, gate, and anode meshes, and is constrained by a set of copper shaping rings outside the reflector barrel. Particle going through the liquid generates scintillation photons and ionized electrons, the latter of which drift to the gas phase and generate electroluminescence photons. Light signals are used to reconstruct energy and position information of a particular event. Vetoing volume resides outside of the PTFE reflectors and is used to reject environment and detector background events originating from outside.",

The Z coordinate is calculated from electron drift velocity in the electric field and the drift time dt, defined as time difference between S1 and S2 signals.

Number of events per bin remains relatively constant along the radius direction since xenon self-shielding is not as effective for high energy events. At the edge of the sensitive volume, an abnormal decrease of event density is observed, which is due to malfunctioning of PAF position reconstruction algorithm with saturated PMT pulses at the detector's edge.

More background events concentrate at the top of the sensitive volume where the top PMT array, stainless steel flanges and pipes contribute significantly. Therefore, the fiducial volume cut in vertical direction is not symmetric.

For a given radioactive source originating from a specific detector component, we simulate a large number of events and obtain the energy deposition information in xenon. Detector response is also considered in the simulation. Hits are merged together when their distance in Z direction is smaller than 8.5 mm, which corresponds roughly to the width of a S2 defined by the gas gap, below which we could not identify a double scatter event. We also remove the events with multiple unmerged hits or with hits inside veto volume or outside fiducial volume. Background contribution from 222 Rn dissolved in the xenon liquid is out of secular equilibrium and considered separately. The 214 Bi in the 222 Rn decay chain, a beta emitter with the associated 2447 keV gamma ray, is largely removed due to the delayed coincidence of 214 Po (see later). Its contribution from the veto region (about 100 kg of liquid xenon) can also be neglected by the active veto of beta energy and the self-shielding effects of liquid xenon. For other isotopes, such as 238 U, spectra from all the components are summed up with a weighting factor, which is derived from the relative radioactivity of each component, as reported in Ref. [19].",

For example, 214 Bi, which is after 222 Rn in the 238 U decay chain, beta decays to polonium nucleus, with a series of signature gamma rays emitted. 214 Po quickly decays to 210 Pb and a 7.7 MeV alpha particle with a half-life of 164.3 \u00b5s. Consequently, decay of 214 Bi and 214 Po is very likely to happen within a readout window width of 1 ms , which is easy to identify. As discussed in Ref. [20], we select the sequential Bi-Po decay events by finding two adjacent S1 signals with time difference consistent with the polonium decay. The concentration of 222 Rn is measured to be (6.6 -8.6) \u00b5Bq/kg during the three runs, while 220 Rn is an order of magnitude lower and ignored in the following analysis. The statistical uncertainty of radon concentration is less than 1% and neglected. The relative systematic uncertainty of 222 Rn is about 50%, estimated from the discrepancy of 214 Po single event rate and 214 Bi-214 Po coincidence event rate [11]. We see a reduction of 222 Rn concentration from Run 9 to 11, possibly due to changes in the circulation and purification conditions. The results agree with our pre-fit results within 1\u03c3 uncertainties.",

The posterior probability distribution and the systematic uncertainties are combined, as shown in Fig. 11. By integrating the positive part of the total likelihood curve to an area of 90% [25], we obtain a limit on NLDBD rate \u0393 0\u03bd < 0.29\u00d710 \u221223 yr \u22121 and NLDBD half-life T 0\u03bd 1/2 > 2.4\u00d710 23 yr at the 90% confidence level (C.

The upper limit of effective Majorana neutrino mass m \u03b2\u03b2 is found to be in the range of 1.3 and 3.5 eV at the 90% C. L..

The fitted probability distribution curves are associated with the systematic table and NLDBD half-life limits at the 90% C. L. are calculated. A total of 12000 MC spectra are analyzed and the median value of derived half-life limits is chosen as the sensitivity.

No evidence of NLDBD event is observed, and the half-life limit for 136 Xe is given to be T 0\u03bd 1/2 > 2.4 \u00d7 10 23 yr at the 90% C. L. and the corresponding upper limit for m \u03b2\u03b2 is the in range of 1.3 to 3.5 eV. This work is the first NLDBD result from dual-phase liquid xenon detector, as far as we are aware. We have developed new techniques of energy reconstruction and event selection, and studied systematically the detector performance in response of MeVscale events at the PandaX-II detector. The background budget of PandaX-II at high energy region is also presented for the first time in this analysis, and will be used to guide the design and construction of future detectors.",

            "text": "Due to limited performance in energy resolution and background rate, our result is not as competitive as the dedicated NLDBD experiments, such as KamLAND-Zen [5]. However, it shows the multi-physics reach of dual-phase liquid xenon detector besides dark matter WIMP search. PandaX-II has been focusing on signals and background in the keV range while NLDBD region of interest is mostly above 2 MeV, where PMT saturation issue deteriorates resolution significantly. On the other hand, we recognize that the resolution is not intrinsically limited. The XENON1T experiment has shown excellent energy resolution [32], comparable with other liquid xenon TPCs. The PandaX collaboration is building the next generation PandaX-4T [33] detector and will use dual-dynode readout for PMTs, to avoid the PMT saturation issues altogether. PandaX-4T is expected to have a much improved energy resolution for double beta decay physics. PandaX-II also suffers from a high background rate in the NLDBD ROI since we can not take advantage of background suppression techniques developed for WIMP signals in the keV region. Techniques such as nuclear recoil and electron recoil discrimination are specific to WIMP searches. Effective self-shielding with detector medium at low energy become much less so at higher energy. In the proposed 30-ton detector such as DAR-WIN [34] and PandaX future generations, the fiducial volume in the core of the detector will be much more effectively shielded. At this future stage, dual-phase liquid xenon detector with natural xenon will be able to explore the inverted neutrino mass hierarchy region in the m \u03b2\u03b2 phase space.",

The combination of 7.4% and 22.75 PE/e yields the best energy resolution and is selected. The achieved best energy resolution is 4.2% at 2615 keV. The PDE and EEE \u00d7 SEG are different from those used in dark matter analysis, which implies changes of detector response in this different energy region. The new set of values is verified with the anticorrelation of S1 and S2 bottom signals, as shown inFig. 5.Residual non-linearity correction A spectrum withoptimized energy resolution can be obtained with the above mentioned procedures. However, peaks could be identified slightly off the true energy of the characteristic gamma lines. Another correction is carried out to shift those peaks and correct the non-linearity of detector's energy response. With a relatively large energy resolution, gamma lines on top of continuum background may not peak in the exact gamma energy. Monte carlo simulation is used to study such shifts. The detailed simulation process is discussed in Sec. 4. Peaks from 915 to 2615 keV are used to correct the residual non-linearity, as shown inFig. 6. For each run, six peaks are used to fit a third-order polynomial function with zero intercept. Then energy of each event is corrected with these fit functions.",
