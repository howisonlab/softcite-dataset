In the exclusive Dalitz plot analysis of the B 0 s \u2192 D 0 K \u2212 \u03c0 + decays, the D 0 K \u2212 mass spectrum shows a complex resonant structure in the 2860 MeV mass region. 4 This is described by a superposition of a broad J P = 1 \u2212 resonance and a narrow J P = 3 \u2212 resonance with no evidence for the production of D * s1 (2700) \u2212 . Since the narrow structure at 2860 MeV seen in inclusive DK and D * K analyses could contain contributions from various resonances with different spins, it is labelled as D * sJ (2860) + . In references [13][14][15][16][17][18] attempts are made to identify these states within the quark model and in ref. [19] within molecular models. The expected spectrum for D + s mesons has recently been recomputed in refs. [20,21]. In particular, ref. [20] points out that six states are expected in the mass region between 2.7 and 3.0 GeV. To date, evidence has been found for three of the states; hence finding the rest would provide an important test of these models. In this paper we study the D * + K 0 S and D * 0 K + systems using pp collision data, collected at centre-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 TeV with the LHCb detector.",

The detector includes a high-precision tracking system consisting of a silicon-strip vertex detector surrounding the pp interaction region, a large-area silicon-strip detector located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4 Tm, and three stations of silicon-strip detectors and straw drift tubes placed downstream of the magnet. The tracking system provides a measurement of momentum, p, of charged particles with a relative uncertainty that varies from 0.5% at low momentum to 1.0% at 200 GeV. The minimum distance of a track to a primary vertex (PV), the impact parameter, is measured with a resolution of (15 + 29/p T ) \u00b5m, where p T is the component of the momentum transverse to the beam, in GeV. Different types of charged hadrons are distinguished using information from two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors (RICH). Photons, electrons and hadrons are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter and a hadronic calorimeter. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers. The online event selection is performed by a trigger, which consists of a hardware stage, based on information from the calorimeter and muon systems, followed by a software stage, which applies a full event reconstruction.",

These conditions are relaxed to p > 1 GeV and p T > 150 MeV for the \"soft\" pion originating directly from the D * + decay. In the reconstruction of the D 0 candidates we remove candidate tracks pointing to a PV, using an impact parameter requirement. All tracks used to reconstruct the D mesons are required to be consistent with forming a common vertex and the D meson candidate must be consistent with being produced at a PV. The D * + and K 0 S , and similarly the D 0 and K + candidates, are fitted to a common vertex, for which a good quality fit is required. The purity of the charmed meson sample is enhanced by requiring the decay products to be identified by the particle identification system, using the difference in the log-likelihood between the kaon and pion hypotheses \u2206 ln L K\u03c0 [31].

This selection is used to improve the signal to background ratio for the D * s2 (2573) + resonance in the D * + K 0 S final state. We also fit the D * + K 0 S mass spectrum using the full dataset and we report the D s1 (2536) + yield indicated as Total in table 3. In eq. (5.6) the total D s1 (2536) + yield is used because of the unnatural parity of this state, and this requires a correction to the D * s2 (2573) + yield for the effects of the NP sample selection. The angular distribution for a NP resonance is expected to be proportional to sin 2 \u03b8 H and therefore the requirement | cos \u03b8 H | < 0.5 selects 69% of the candidates. This correction in eq. (5.6) is included through the factor f NP = 1.45.",
