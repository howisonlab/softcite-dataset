Five single-spin and three double-spin azimuthal asymmetries were measured as a function of Q 2 , x B j , or p 2 T . The sin\u03c6 S asymmetry is found to be \u22120.019 \u00b1 0.008(stat.) \u00b1 0.003(syst.). All other asymmetries are also found to be of small magnitude and consistent with zero within experimental uncertainties. Very recent calculations using a GPD-based model agree well with the present results. The data is interpreted as evidence for the existence of chiral-odd, transverse generalized parton distributions.",

            "text": "The spin structure of the nucleon is a key issue in experimental and theoretical research since a few decades. The most general information on the partonic structure of hadrons is contained in the generalised parton correlation functions (GPCFs) [1,2], which parameterise the fully unintegrated, off-diagonal parton-parton correlators for a given hadron. These GPCFs are 'mother distributions' of the generalised parton distributions (GPDs) and the transverse momentum dependent parton distributions (TMDs), which can be considered as different projections or limiting cases of GPCFs. While GPDs appear in the QCD-description of hard exclusive processes such as deeply virtual Compton scattering (DVCS) and hard exclusive meson production (HEMP), TMDs can be measured in reactions like semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering (SIDIS) or Drell-Yan processes. The GPDs and TMDs provide complementary 3-dimensional pictures of the nucleon. In particular, when Fourier-transformed to impact parameter space and for the case of vanishing longitudinal momentum transfer, GPDs provide a three dimensional description of the nucleon in a mixed momentumcoordinate space, also known as 'nucleon tomography' [3,4]. Moreover, GPDs and TMDs contain information on the orbital motion of partons inside the nucleon.",

In phenomenological pQCD-inspired models k \u22a5 factorisation is used, where k \u22a5 denotes the parton transverse momentum. In the model of Refs. [7][8][9], electroproduction of a light vector meson V at small x B j is analysed in the 'handbag' approach, in which the amplitude of the process is a convolution of GPDs with amplitudes for the partonic subprocesses \u03b3 * q \u2192 V q and \u03b3 * g \u2192 V g. Here, q and g denote quarks and gluons, respectively. The partonic subprocess amplitudes, which comprise corresponding hard scattering kernels and meson DAs, are calculated in the modified perturbative approach where the transverse momenta of quark and antiquark forming the vector meson are retained and Sudakov suppressions are taken into account. The partons are still emitted and reabsorbed from the nucleon collinear to the nucleon momentum. In such models, cross sections and also spin-density matrix elements for HEMP by both longitudinal and transverse virtual photons can be well described simultaneously [7,10].",

These GPDs are of special interest as they are related to the total angular momentum carried by partons in the nucleon [11]. A variety of GPD fits using all existing DVCS proton data has shown that the GPDs H f are well constrained over the presently limited accessible x B j range, by the very low x B j data of the HERA collider and by the high x B j data of HERMES and JLab [12][13][14][15]. There exist constraints on GPDs E f for valence quarks from fits to nucleon form factor data [16], HERMES transverse proton data [17] and JLab neutron data [18]. A parameterisation of chiral-even GPDs [9], which is consistent with the HEMP data of HERMES [19] and COMPASS [20], was recently demonstrated to successfully describe almost all existing DVCS data [21]. This is clear evidence for the consistency of the contemporary phenomenological GPD-based description of both DVCS and HEMP.",

A mixture of liquid 3 He and 4 He is used to cool the target to 50 mK. Ten NMR coils surrounding the target allow for a determination of the target polarisation P T , which typical amounts to 0.8 with an uncertainty of 3%. The ammonia is contained in three cylindrical target cells with a diameter of 4 cm, placed one after another along the beam. The central cell is 60 cm long and the two outer ones are 30 cm long, with 5 cm space between cells. The spin directions in neighbouring cells are opposite. Such a target configuration allows for a simultaneous measurement of azimuthal asymmetries for the two target spin directions in order to become independent of beam flux measurements. Systematic effects due to acceptance are reduced by reversing the spin directions on a weekly basis. With the three-cell configuration, the average acceptance for cells with opposite spin direction is approximately the same, which leads to a further reduction of systematic uncertainties.",

Combined in quadrature this gives an overall systematic normalisation uncertainty of 3.6% for the asymmetries A m UT and 6.2% for A m LT . Additional systematic uncertainties are obtained from separate studies of i) a possible bias of the applied estimator, ii) the stability of the asymmetries over data-taking time, and iii) the robustness of the applied background subtraction method and a difference between the mean asymmetries obtained in the x B j , Q 2 and p 2 T binning, which is originating from averaging the depolarisation factors. A summary of these three systematic uncertainties for the average asymmetries can be found in Table 1. The total systematic uncertainty is obtained as a quadratic sum of these three components and the normalisation uncertainty.",

The transition from S T to P T introduces in the cross section [26] the angle \u03b8 between the virtual photon and the beam direction, which is small at COMPASS kinematics. Additionally, some of the A UT(LT) asymmetries get mixed with A UL(LL) asymmetries that are suppressed by sin \u03b8 . Presently the influence of the \u03b8 -related corrections can only be studied based on a few available measurements [32,33] of the double-spin asymmetry A LL for proton targets in the kinematic range similar to that of COMPASS. Taking into account the smallness of sin \u03b8 at COMPASS (sin \u03b8 \u2248 0.04 on average), the correction was found to be negligible. We provide the values of sin \u03b8 in the Durham data base [34] to allow for corrections when new or more precise data on A UL(LL) become available.",

The background corrected distributions, N sig k (\u03c6, \u03c6 S ), are obtained from the measured distributions in the signal region, N sig,raw k (\u03c6, \u03c6 S ), and in the background region 7 GeV < E miss < 20 GeV, N back k (\u03c6, \u03c6 S ). The distributions N back k (\u03c6, \u03c6 S ) are rescaled with the estimated numbers of background events in the signal region and afterwards subtracted from the N sig,raw k (\u03c6, \u03c6 S ) distributions. As no kinematic dependence of the semi-inclusive background asymmetries, which were small, was observed in the background region, no systematic uncertainty is assigned due to extrapolation of this background into the E miss region of the signal.",
