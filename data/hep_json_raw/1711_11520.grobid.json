Supersymmetry (SUSY) [8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16], which extends the SM by introducing supersymmetric partners for every SM particle, can provide an elegant solution to the hierarchy problem. The partner particles have identical quantum numbers except for a half-unit difference in spin. The superpartners of the left-and right-handed top quarks,t L andt R , mix to form the two mass eigenstatest 1 andt 2 (top squark or stop), wheret 1 is the lighter of the two. 1 If the supersymmetric partners of the top quarks have masses 1 TeV, loop diagrams involving top quarks, which are the dominant divergent contribution to the Higgs-boson mass, can largely cancel out [17][18][19][20][21][22][23][24].",

The central hadronic calorimeter is a sampling calorimeter with scintillator tiles as the active medium and steel absorbers. All the electromagnetic calorimeters, as well as the endcap and forward hadronic calorimeters, are sampling calorimeters with liquid argon as the active medium and lead, copper, or tungsten absorbers. The MS consists of three layers of high-precision tracking chambers with coverage up to |\u03b7| = 2.7 and dedicated chambers for triggering in the region |\u03b7| < 2.4. Events are selected by a two-level trigger system [85]: the first level is a hardware-based system and the second is a software-based system. This analysis is based on a dataset collected in 2015 and 2016 at a collision energy of \u221a s = 13 TeV. The data contain an average number of simultaneous pp interactions per bunch crossing, or \"pile-up\", of approximately 23.7 across the two years. After the application of beam, detector and data-quality requirements, the total integrated luminosity is 36.1 fb \u22121 with an associated uncertainty of 3.2%. The uncertainty is derived following a methodology similar to that detailed in ref. [86] from a preliminary calibration of the luminosity scale using a pair of x-y beam separation scans performed in August 2015 and June 2016.  Table 1. Overview of the nominal simulated samples.",

To recover acceptance for signals with moderate E miss T , events having a well-identified lepton with a minimum p T at trigger level are also accepted for several selections. Events in which the offline reconstructed E miss T is measured to be less than 230 GeV are collected using single-lepton triggers, where the thresholds are set to obtain a constant efficiency as a function of the lepton p T of \u224890% (\u224880%) for electrons (muons).",

The decays of the\u03c7 0 2 and\u03c7 \u00b1 1 via highly off-shell W/Z bosons were computed by taking into account the mass of \u03c4 leptons and charm quarks in the low \u2206m(\u03c7 For thet 1 \u2192 t\u03c7 0 1 samples, the stop was decayed in Pythia8 using only phase space considerations and not the full matrix element. Since the decay products of the samples generated did not preserve spin information, a polarisation reweighting was applied 7 following refs. [129,130]. For thet 1 \u2192 bW\u03c7 0 1 andt 1 \u2192 bf f \u03c7 0 1 samples, the stop was decayed with MadSpin [131], interfaced to Pythia8. MadSpin emulates kinematic distributions such as the mass of the bW system to a good approximation without calculating the full ME. For the MadSpin samples, the stop was assumed to be composed mainly oft R (\u223c70%), consistent with thet 1 \u2192 t\u03c7 0 1 samples.",

Baseline muons up to |\u03b7| = 2.7 are used and they are required to have p T > 4 GeV and to satisfy the 'Loose' identification criteria. Signal muons must pass all baseline requirements and in addition have impact parameters |z 0 sin \u03b8| < 0.5 mm and |d 0 |/\u03c3 d 0 < 3, and satisfy the 'Medium' identification criteria. Furthermore, signal muons must be isolated according to criteria similar to those used for signal electrons, but with a fixed requirement on track-based isolation energy divided by the muon's p T . No separation into 'loose' and 'tight' classes is performed for signal muons.",

Given a set of baseline objects, the procedure checks for overlap based on either a shared track, ghost-matching [153], or a minimum distance 10 \u2206R between pairs of objects. For example, if a baseline electron and a baseline jet are separated by \u2206R < 0.2, then the electron is retained (as stated in the 'Precedence' row) and the jet is discarded, unless the jet is b-tagged (as stated in the 'Condition' row) in which case the electron is assumed to originate from a heavy-flavour decay and is hence discarded while the jet is retained. If the matching requirement in table 3 is not met, then both objects under consideration are kept. The order of the steps in the procedure is given by the columns in table 3, which are executed from left to right. The second (ej) and the third (\u00b5j) steps of the procedure ensure that leptons and jets have a minimum \u2206R separation of 0.2. Jets overlapping with muons that satisfy one or more of the following conditions are not considered in the third step: the jet is b-tagged, the jet contains more than three tracks (n j track > 3), or the ratio of muon p T to jet p T satisfies p \u00b5 T /p j T < 0.7. Therefore, the fourth step ( j) is applied only to the jets that satisfy the JHEP06(2018)108  Table 3. Overlap removal procedure for physics objects.

All objects refer to the baseline definitions, except for \u03c4 where no distinction between baseline and signal definition is made. The third row specifies when an object pair is considered to be overlapping. The fourth row describes an optional condition which must also be met for the pair of objects to be considered overlapping. The last row lists the object given precedence.

Based on these objects, the azimuthal separation between the p T of hadronic and of leptonic top-quark candidates, \u2206\u03c6(t \u03c7 had , t \u03c7 lep ) and between the missing transverse momentum vector and the p T of hadronic top-quark candidate, \u2206\u03c6( p miss T , t \u03c7 had ), are defined. An alternative top-tagging method is used to target events where the top quark is produced with a significant boost. The top-quark candidates are reconstructed by considering all small-radius jets in the event and clustering them into large-radius jets using the anti-k t algorithm with a radius parameter R 0 = 3.0. The radius of each jet is then iteratively reduced to an optimal radius, R(p T ) = 2 \u00d7 m top /p T , that matches their p T . If a candidate loses a large fraction of its p T in the shrinking process, it is discarded. 13 In events where two or more top-quark candidates are found, the one with the mass closest to the top-quark mass is taken. The same algorithm is also used to define boosted hadronic W -boson candidates, where only non-b-tagged jets are considered, and the mass of the W boson is used to define the optimal radius. The masses of the reclustered top-quark and W -boson candidates are referred to as m reclustered top and m reclustered W , respectively. The p miss T in semileptonic tt events is expected to be closely aligned with the direction of the leptonic top quark. After boosting the leptonic top-quark candidate and the p miss T into the tt rest frame, computed from t \u03c7 had and t \u03c7 lep , the magnitude of the perpendicular component of the p miss T with respect to the leptonic top quark is computed. This E miss T,\u22a5 is expected to be small for the background, as the dominant contribution to the total E miss T is due to the neutrino emitted in the leptonic top-quark decay.",

In order to estimate the tt + Z contribution in the SRs, Z-boson decays into charged leptons are exploited to define highpurity CRs (TZCR). The tt + V CRs require exactly three loose signal leptons, at least one of which must also satisfy the tight criteria. Two leptons are required to have same flavour and opposite charge, and the mass of the dilepton system (m ) is required to be in the range 81 GeV < m < 101 GeV. If more than one same-flavour and oppositecharge pairing is possible, the pair with a mass closest to m Z is chosen. In addition, at least four jets, one of which is b-tagged, are required. The minimum jet p T of the four leading jets is required to match the thresholds used in the corresponding SR. The diboson process (W Z \u2192 \u03bd ) is a dominant background in the TZCR, and is normalised to data in a region identical to the TZCR, except for the requirement that no jet is b-tagged. A constant diboson normalisation factor of 0.8, derived in this region, is applied to all TZCRs.",

The resulting p-values (p 0 ) are also presented in the tables, and are capped at 0.5. Modelindependent upper limits on beyond-SM contributions are derived for each SR. A generic signal model is assumed that contributes only to the SR and for which neither experimental nor theoretical systematic uncertainties except for the luminosity uncertainty are considered.

Figures 24 and 25 show the exclusion contours for the three signal scenarios, m tR < m q3L , m q3L < m tR , and m q3L < m tR with large tan \u03b2, as described in section 4. The results are based on the combination of two orthogonal hard-and soft-lepton SRs. The stop decay branching ratios to t\u03c7 0 1 , b\u03c7 \u00b1 1 and t\u03c7 0 2 vary in these three scenarios. In the scenario with m tR < m q3L , the sensitivity is mostly driven by the bCsoft med and bCsoft high SRs, as the branching ratio of thet 1 \u2192 b\u03c7 \u00b1 1 decay (with soft leptons) is large, whereas the sensitivity is driven by the tN med SR for the scenario with m q3L < m tR , as the branching ratios of thet 1 \u2192 t\u03c7  benefits from both the soft-and hard-lepton SRs, with equal branching ratios to all three decay modes.  Limits are also set on the masses of thet 1 and\u03c7 0 1 in the well-tempered neutralino scenario as shown in figure 27. In the scenario with m q3L < m tR , the expected sensitivity is better than in the scenario with m tR < m q3L as sbottom pair production can also contribute to the former, roughly doubling the signal acceptance. No observed limit is set in the m tR < m q3L scenario, as a mild excess of data events is seen above the predicted SM background yield in the bCsoft high SR (shape-fit, as shown in figure 19), which is the most sensitive SR in this scenario. On the other hand, the stop mass region up to 810 GeV is excluded in scenarios with m q3L < m tR . Figure 28 shows the upper limit on the ratio of the DM+tt production cross-section to the theoretical cross-section. Limits are shown under the hypothesis of a scalar or pseudoscalar mediator, and for a fixed DM candidate mass or for a fixed mediator mass. A scalar (pseudoscalar) mediator mass of around 100 GeV (20 GeV) is excluded at 95% CL, assuming a 1 GeV dark-matter particle mass and a common coupling of g = 1 to SM and dark-matter particles.
