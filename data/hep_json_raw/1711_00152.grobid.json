This work concentrates on an overview of results obtained in SUSY searches by the ATLAS 5 and the CMS 6 experiments running at the LHC. Many models predicting sparticles observable at the LHC have been developed, ranging from easy-to-observe models with clear signatures and large cross sections to models with very low signal cross sections that are difficult to distinguish from the relevant SM backgrounds. The cross sections of the expected SUSY production mechanisms are shown in Fig. 1 as functions of the produced sparticles. The represented colored particle cross sections are from nll-fast 7 and evaluated at \u221a s = 8 TeV and 13 TeV, the electroweak pure higgsino cross sections are from prospino 8 and evaluated at \u221a s = 8 TeV and 14 TeV. Each of the analyses presented here uses selections on various observables in order to enhance signals with respect to SM background. Signal regions (SRs) are defined using Monte Carlo (MC) simulation of the signal and of the SM processes, suitable control regions (CRs) are used to quantify each background source, and validation regions (VRs) are defined and exploited to test the descriptions provided by such estimates.",

            "text": "ATLAS and CMS have optimized a large number of analyses to search for simplified scenarios in whichgg,qq andqg pairs are produced. As an example, CMS searches for fully hadronic final states 9 rely on a huge number of SRs, defined according to requirements on the number of (b-)jets in the event and on other variables, such as the missing transverse energy (E miss T ) and the sum of jets transverse momentum p T (H T ). As shown in Fig. 2, the observed and expected SM event yields compare very well for all the considered SRs. Also the SUSY searches performed by ATLAS on decays with no leptons in the final state 10 have shown no significant excess of events with respect to the SM expectation, as the largest significance measured in a SR corresponds to only 2.14 standard deviations.   Searches with 1, 2 or more isolated leptons in the final state present the advantage of removing the SM multijet background from the SRs. As an example, in Fig. 3 the event yield is shown for ATLAS searches 11 with two same-sign (or three) leptons in the final state. Owing to their special topology, the SRs are almost SM background free and the main limitation in the analysis is given by the reduced statistics. In thegg simplified RPC models considered, the hypothesis of gluinos with masses up to 1.87 TeV is excluded in scenarios with a light\u03c7 . After combining a collection of different analyses targeting SUSY strong production, the resulting exclusion contours from both ATLAS ( Fig. 4) and CMS ( Fig. 5) with about 36 fb \u22121 are obtained and presented in the m(g) \u2212 m(\u03c7 0 1 ) plane. Compared to Run 1, exclusion limits are becoming more and more stringent on the mass of gluinos and of 1 st and 2 nd generation squarks, and for the first time the sensitivity on masses has reached values beyond 2 TeV.",

This has allowed ATLAS and CMS experiments to carry out a wide variety of SUSY searches, for which still no significant deviation from the Standard Model has been observed. In particular, progresses have been shown regarding searches for strongly produced squarks and gluinos, third generation squarks, direct electroweak production and R-parity violating scenarios. Excluded mass ranges have been extended with respect to LHC Run 1, as they have reached approximately 2 TeV for gluinos, more than 1 TeV for top and     bottom squarks and more than 500 GeV for charginos and neutralinos. Much more data collected at \u221a s = 13 TeV in 2017 will enrich the full dataset of Run 2, thus hopefully bringing to new encouraging results on a wide range of SUSY analyses.",
