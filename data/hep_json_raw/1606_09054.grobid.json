This motivates the use of the same trigger. To search for a heavy neutrino we used the main E949 trigger [9]. This trigger consisted of several requirements. First, a kaon had to enter the target. To be sure that the kaon decayed at rest, the secondary charged particle had to leave the target at least 1.5 ns later than the kaon hit in the\u010cerenkov detector. The 3-body K + decays were suppressed by the RS layer requirements. The charged particle had to reach at least the sixth layer of the RS (Fid&Range). Long tracks (e.g. from K + \u2192 \u00b5 + \u03bd \u00b5 decays) were suppressed by the layer 19 veto requirement.

These criteria were exactly the same as for the heavy neutrinos search [9] since the experimental signature of the K + \u2192 \u00b5 + \u03bd\u03bd\u03bd decay is similar to the K + \u2192 \u00b5 + \u03bd H decay. The acceptances of all selection criteria were measured using muon samples from the K + \u2192 \u00b5 + \u03bd \u00b5 and K + \u2192 \u00b5 + \u03bd \u00b5 \u03b3 decays passed through monitor triggers. The description of acceptance measurements may be found in [9]. The total acceptance after all cuts is shown in Fig. 3. The acceptance drop off below 140 MeV/c is due to the requirement that the charged track must reach at least the sixth layer of the RS. The acceptance drop off above 200 MeV/c is due to two requirements. First, the charged track must not reach layer 19 of the range stack and second, the refined range removes long tracks which are dominant at high momentum for events passing the layer 19 requirement. The main acceptance loss (factor \u223c 20) comes from the online pion identification requirement (see Figure 3).",

Two proposed muon momentum spectra, neutrino-neutrino interaction and six-fermion interaction, were considered and we improved the current limits on the total decay rate in the framework of these models and for the Standard Model. We also presented the method of calculation of total rates on the K + \u2192 \u00b5 + \u03bd\u03bd\u03bd process for any assumed muon momentum spectrum.",
