The femtoscopic correlations allow one to measure the space-time characteristics of particle production using particle correlations due to the effects of quantum statistics for identical particles and final state interaction for both identical and non-identical ones. Small contributions from resonance decays make kaon femtoscopy an ideal tool for the correlation studies. In conjunction with pion and proton femtoscopy, they can also reveal properties of collective dynamics in heavy-ion collisions. ALICE results are compared with the existing world data on kaon femtoscopy in different type of collisions.

Studying the QGP is the main goal of the ALICE experiment (A Large Ion Collider Experiment) [2]. The highly compressed strongly-interacting system is expected to undergo longitudinal and transverse expansions. Experimentally, the expansion and the spatial extent at decoupling are observable via Bose-Einstein correlations. Bose-Einstein correlations of two identical pions at low relative momenta were first shown to be sensitive to the spatial scale of the emitting source by G. Goldhaber, S. Goldhaber, W. Lee and A. Pais 50 years ago [3]. The correlation method since developed and known at present as \"correlation femtoscopy\" was successfully applied to the measurement of the space-time characteristics of particle production processes in high energy collisions, especially in heavy-ion collisions (see, e.g. [4][5][6]).",

Previous K ch K ch studies carried out in Pb-Pb collisions at SPS by the NA44 and NA49 Collaborations [8] reported the decrease of the long radii (R long ) with m T as \u223c m \u22120.5 T as a consequence of the boost-invariant longitudinal flow [9]; the transverse radii (R T ) decrease as \u223c m \u22120. 3 T . The common m Tscaling for \u03c0 and K is an indication of the fact that the thermal freeze-out occurs simultaneously for \u03c0 and K and they receive a common Lorentz boost.

The multiplicity and m T dependencies of the radii were studied.  [2]. The kaons were selected in kinematic ranges: |\u03b7| < 0.8 and 0.14 < p T < 1.5 GeV/c. The quality of the track is determined by the \u03c7 2 /N value for the Kalman fit to the reconstructed position of the TPC clusters (N is the number of clusters attached to the track); the track was rejected if the value is larger than 4.0. In order to reduce the number of secondary particles it is required that the distance from particle trajectory to the primary vertex (distance of the closest approach, DCA) is less than 2.4 cm in the transverse plane and 3.0 cm in the beam direction. For the charge kaon analysis the good PID is crucially important. In the present analysis, kaons are selected using the TPC and TOF detectors. It is required that the deviation of the specific (dE/dx) energy loss in TPC from the one calculated using parametrized Bethe-Bloch formula is within some number of sigma standard deviations (N \u03c3T PC ). A similar N \u03c3T OF method is applied for the particle identification in TOF. The difference is considered between the measured time-of-flight and the calculated one as a function of the track length and the particle momentum for each particle mass. The following cuts are used for kaon selection in TPC and TOF: N \u03c3T PC < 2 at p T < 0.5 GeV/c; at p T > 0.5 GeV/c N \u03c3T PC < 3 and N \u03c3T OF < 2.",
