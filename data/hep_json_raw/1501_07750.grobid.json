Data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 4.9 fb \u22121 in pp collisions at \u221a s = 7 TeV were collected with the CMS detector at the LHC. The analysis selects events with dimuon rapidity |y| < 1.2 and dimuon transverse momentum in the range 10 < p T < 100 GeV. The measurements show a transition from an exponential to a power-law behavior at p T \u2248 20 GeV for the three \u03d2 states. Above that transition, the \u03d2(3S) spectrum is significantly harder than that of the \u03d2(1S). The ratios of the \u03d2(3S) and \u03d2(2S) differential cross sections to the \u03d2(1S) cross section show a rise as p T increases at low p T , then become flatter at higher p T .",

The dimuon efficiency \u03bc\u03bc for a given (p T , |y|) is obtained by averaging the calculated event dimuon efficiency \u03bc\u03bc for each data event in the bin. This is done separately for the three \u03d2 states, using a mass range of \u00b1200 MeV for the \u03d2(1S) and \u00b1100 MeV for the higher-mass states. The narrower range for the \u03d2(2S) and \u03d2(3S) states is chosen because of the closeness in mass of these two states. The average efficiency, \u03bc\u03bc , is typically 0.75-0.80. For all (p T , y) bins the systematic difference between averaging in \u03bc\u03bc or 1/ \u03bc\u03bc can be neglected in comparison to the quoted systematic uncertainty due to the single muon efficiencies.

For each p T bin the optimal background function is determined using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) [25], taking the function with the largest relative probability, as discussed in Ref. [26]. This method is similar to a maximum-likelihood evaluation, but it adds a term equal to twice the number of free parameters in the fit, thus penalizing addition of free parameters. The parameters c w and \u03b4m are determined from the fit for each p T bin. Typical values and corresponding uncertainties for c w and \u03b4m are 1.04 \u00b1 0.01 and 3 \u00b1 1 MeV, respectively.

The systematic uncertainty from the background function is estimated using the maximum difference in yields among background functions with an AIC probability above 5% [25,26] relative to the best background choice. An upper limit of 1% on the systematic uncertainty from the lineshape function determination for all three \u03d2(nS) states and all (p T , |y|) bins is estimated by varying the width of the mass region in which the mass resolution parameter \u03b6 is determined. The efficiency systematic is evaluated by modifying \u03bc\u03bc event by event, using the \u00b11 standard deviation values from the tag-and-probe measurements [5]. There is a 1% systematic uncertainty to account for small variations in \u03bc\u03bc as a function of M \u03bc\u03bc observed in the data. The measured \u03c1 factor values from the experimental determination and from MC simulation agree over the full p T range. We assign a systematic uncertainty for \u03c1 of 0.5-5%, which equals the full difference between the MC simulation and the experimental measurement. We compute the acceptance systematic uncertainty by raising and lowering all three polarization parameters by their interpolated 68.3% CL values from Ref. [5]. The resulting 5-8% change in the acceptance is used as the systematic uncertainty in the acceptance as tabulated in the supplemental material (Tables 7-15). The total systematic uncertainty is found from the quadrature sum of the individual systematic uncertainties. It is comparable to or smaller than the statistical uncertainty for p T > 40 GeV. There is a 2.2% uncertainty [27] from the integrated luminosity determination that applies to all p T bins.

These new CMS data provide a significant extension of the p T range that can be used in evaluating matrix elements and studying p T -dependent corrections in NRQCD and other models. The new results on \u03d2(3S) production are sufficiently accurate to allow one to focus model building of the p T behavior on that state, for which feeddown contributions come only from the \u03c7 b (3P).",
