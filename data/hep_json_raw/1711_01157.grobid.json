            "text": "Nonleptonic decays of charmed baryons are a useful environment in which to study the interplay of the weak and strong interactions. Measurements of their branching fractions are of great importance in understanding the internal dynamics of the decays. The last few years have seen advances in the study of \u039b + c \u2192 phh decays, where hh \u2208 {K \u2212 \u03c0 + , K \u2212 K + , \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + , \u03c0 \u2212 K + }. Until recently, measurements of the absolute branching fraction of the \u039b + c \u2192 pK \u2212 \u03c0 + decay suffered from model dependence, relying on assumptions concerning several B, \u039b + c and D + branching fraction ratios and decay widths. The first modelindependent measurements of the absolute branching fraction of the \u039b + c \u2192 pK \u2212 \u03c0 + decay have been made by the Belle [1] and BESIII [2] collaborations. The precision of a number of \u039b + c decay branching fractions has also been improved at the B factories [2][3][4][5], while the first measurement of a doubly Cabibbo-suppressed (DCS) charmed-baryon decay, \u039b + c \u2192 p\u03c0 \u2212 K + , has been performed by the Belle collaboration [6]. Unlike in the charmed-meson sector, there exist a large number of favoured internal W -boson exchange decays which can be readily studied. Quark-level diagrams demonstrating external W -emission, internal W -emission, and W -exchange are shown in figure 1. As can be seen, while W -boson exchange is not permitted in the decay \u039b + c \u2192 p\u03c0 \u2212 K + , it is allowed in the decay \u039b + c \u2192 pK \u2212 \u03c0 + . The ratio of the branching fractions B(\u039b + c \u2192 p\u03c0 \u2212 K + )/B(\u039b + c \u2192 pK \u2212 \u03c0 + ) is a useful variable with which to indirectly study the -1 -  Figure 1.

The tracking system provides a measurement of momentum, p, of charged particles with a relative uncertainty that varies from 0.5% at low momentum to 1.0% at 200 GeV/c. The minimum distance of a track to a primary vertex, the impact parameter (IP), is measured with a resolution of (15 + 29/p T ) \u00b5m, where p T is the component of the momentum transverse to the beam, in GeV/c.

In each case, candidates are generated from probability density functions according to the fitted values for each decay mode, with each candidate assigned an invariant mass and a ln \u03c7 2 IP . The number of candidates generated per species is the number found in the nominal fit to the data. The fit procedure is repeated for each generated data sample as in the nominal fit. The extracted prompt yield is shown to be unbiased, and the standard deviation on the distribution of the prompt yields verifies the reported uncertainty in the nominal fit.   measurements in table 3, and for the prompt measurements in table 4. The systematics for the SL and prompt analyses are described together. The uncertainties on the PID efficiencies are determined in bins of track momentum and pseudorapidity and propagated to determine the systematic uncertainties on the ratios of branching fractions. It is assumed that the efficiency for each candidate track in a given kinematic bin is single-valued, while the finite bin size results in a kinematic distribution within each bin. As such, small differences in the kinematic distributions of calibration and signal tracks within each bin can result in systematic errors in the assigned efficiencies. The effect of this variation in kinematics is tested by repeating the calibration procedure with a variety of binning schemes, such that the kinematic distributions of calibration and signal tracks within each bin are altered. After the calibration procedure has been carried out for each binning scheme and a PID selection efficiency ratio determined for each, the maximum deviation from the nominal efficiency ratio is assigned as a systematic uncertainty. For the SL measurements this is the dominant source of systematic uncertainty, ranging from 1.4% to 2.0%.",
