            "text": "The low-energy frontier of elementary particle physics [1][2][3][4][5][6] includes numerous experimental efforts, ranging from the search for neutrinoless double beta decay and searches for nucleon and electron electric dipole moments all the way to searches for new low-mass bosons. The best-motivated case for the latter remains the axion, the pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson of a new broken global U\u00f01\u00de symmetry, that is required in the context of the Peccei-Quinn mechanism to explain why CP-violating effects are extremely small or absent in QCD [7,8]. The axion is also an excellent candidate for the cold dark matter of the universe [9] and ongoing experimental searches as well as new efforts have recently gained fresh momentum [10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20][21][22][23]. On the other hand, the phenomenology of axions has inspired the proposition of axionlike particles (ALPs) and other WISPs (weakly interacting sub-eV particles) with additional theoretical motivations from string theory and cosmology. Experimental searches for low-mass bosons include precision searches for new long-range forces [24][25][26][27] and oscillating nucleon electric dipole moments [28][29][30].",

The smallness of the coupling strength g a\u03b3 can be overcome by coherent conversion in a macroscopic volume. For more than ten years, the CERN Axion Solar Telescope (CAST) has pursued this idea in the form of a large axion helioscope [32][33][34][35][36]. Earlier helioscope searches were conducted in Brookhaven [37] and Tokyo [38][39][40]. In CAST, a refurbished LHC dipole magnet (length 9.26 m, field strength 9.0 T) is mounted to follow the Sun for approximately 1.5 h at both sunrise and sunset. In this way various x-ray detectors at both ends of the magnet are used to look at the Sun.",

For larger m a values, the transition rate can be restored by providing photons with a refractive mass using a low-Z gas filling [41]. The gas density (i.e. pressure) defines the search mass and one needs to step through many pressure settings to search a broad m a range.",

The vacuum phase (2003)(2004) achieved the best sensitivity up to m a \u223c 0.02 eV because of the long exposure time. With 4 He filling (2005)(2006)(2007), the maximum search mass was extended to \u223c0.4 eV, corresponding to the 4 He vapor pressure at cryogenic temperatures. With 3 He in 2009-2011 we finally reached 1.17 eV, which exceeds the cosmological hot dark matter limit for axions [42][43][44][45][46][47]. For m a > 0.6 eV our 3 He search has reached the \"axion line\" for a typical hadronic axion model [48,49] (E=N \u00bc 0, see Fig. 1), i.e., the locus of g a\u03b3 vs m a which is motivated by QCD axions, as opposed to more general ALPs.",

Therefore, CAST has engaged in a program of technical improvements and renewed data taking to achieve these goals. We report here on results from our 2012 data-taking campaign with 4 He gas. At each pressure setting, we integrated for about 7.5 h per detector (five solar trackings), in contrast to 1.5 h (one solar tracking) in our earlier 4 He campaign. On the sunset side, new Micromegas detectors with improved shielding and veto were installed, decreasing the background level by an approximate factor of 4 [57]. The search masses were selected to cover a previous \"candidate setting\" (m a \u223c 0.2 eV), where unusually many events above background had appeared, and the upper end of what can be reached with 4 He (m a \u223c 0.4 eV) in order to reach the KSVZ (Kim, Shifman, Vainshtein, Zakharov model) axion line.",

In order to estimate the effect of such uncertainties the upper limit calculation has been redone using a reduced effective coherence length L eff \u00bc 8 m for all vertical angles.

While the detectors on the sunrise side remained unchanged since the previous data-taking campaign, the Micromegas detectors on the sunset side were upgraded, improving the background levels of the detectors. This is the result of low background techniques developed for the Micromegas detectors [57], where different strategies were exploited: the manufacturing technology of the novel microbulk Micromegas, the intrinsic radiopurity of the detectors [63], the discrimination algorithms on the analysis, and different shielding strategies.",

It is connected to the magnet bores by a 10 mm thick copper pipe, which has an inner polytetrafluoroethylene coating of 2.5 mm thickness in order to attenuate the 8 keV copper fluorescence. In addition, the aluminum strongback was replaced by a more radiopure copper one, and all the components close to the detector have been carefully selected and cleaned.

Typical tracking and background spectra of one of the detectors in the sunset side are shown in Fig. 2. As seen both levels are compatible within their error. The background is dominated by the copper fluorescence at 8 keV, its escape peak above 5 keV and the Argon fluorescence around 3 keV. According to our current understanding of the background [57,64,65], these fluorescences are induced by secondary particles generated in the inner materials by external radiation, mainly muons that are not tagged by the active veto system. On the other hand, the detector response has been fully characterized by a detailed simulation [65] and calibrations at different energies in an x-ray beam [66]. Moreover, daily calibrations allow us to monitor the performance of the detectors during the data-taking period (see Ref. [57] for more details). The extensive research program for the background reduction continues; different measurements in special set-ups have been performed, such as the ones underground at the Laboratorio Subterr\u00e1neo de Canfranc [67], where the cosmic muons are highly suppressed, and the test at surface level [66]. These special test benches, together with the simulations [65], were crucial in order to understand the origin of the background in the Micromegas detectors. Additional upgrades have been implemented at CAST for the rescanned vacuum phase that started in 2013, like the AFTER [68] front end electronics and a new design of the active shielding on the sunset side, with improved background levels on the Micromegas detectors further.",
