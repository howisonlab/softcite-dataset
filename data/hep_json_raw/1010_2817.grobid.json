            "text": "A central goal of flavor physics is the determination of all elements of the CKM matrix [1], both magnitudes and phases. Of the three angles of the b \u2212 d CKM triangle, denoted \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3 by some, \u03c6 2 , \u03c6 1 , and \u03c6 3 by others, the least well determined is \u03b3/\u03c6 3 , the phase of V cb relative to V ub . It is of great interest to determine \u03b3/\u03c6 3 using the decay B \u00b1 \u2192 K \u00b1 D 0 , since in this mode, the \u03b3/\u03c6 3 value is expected to be insensitive to new physics effects in B decay; here, D 0 is either a D 0 or D 0 meson decaying to the same final state. This is in contrast with most measurements of CP violation, which are dominated by processes that have significant contributions from loop diagrams that can be influenced by new physics [2,3]. Therefore, precise measurements of \u03b3/\u03c6 3 from the decay B \u00b1 \u2192 K \u00b1 D 0 compared to the predictions for \u03b3/\u03c6 3 from loop-dominated processes provide a stringent test of the origin of CP violation in the Standard Model. Sensitivity to the angle \u03b3/\u03c6 3 comes from the interference between two Cabibbo-suppressed diagrams: b \u2192 cus, giving rise to B \u2212 \u2192 K \u2212 D 0 , 1 and the color and CKM suppressed process b \u2192 ucs, giving rise to B \u2212 \u2192 K \u2212 D 0 [4]. Promising D 0 decays for measuring \u03b3/\u03c6 3 using this method are D 0 \u2192 K 0 S \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 [5,6] and D 0 \u2192 K 0 S K + K \u2212 , here designated collectively as D 0 \u2192 K 0 S h + h \u2212 . To make use of these decays, however, it is necessary to understand the interference effects between D 0 \u2192 K 0 S h + h \u2212 and D 0 \u2192 K 0 S h + h \u2212 . These effects can be measured using CLEO-c data. A study of the decay D 0 \u2192 K 0 S \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 has already been published [7]. Here we present an update of that analysis, and first results from the decay D 0 \u2192 K 0 S K + K \u2212 . Let us write the amplitude for the B \u2212 \u2192 K \u2212 D 0 , D 0 \u2192 K 0 S h + h \u2212 decay as follows:",

            "text": "We also present the first model-independent measurement of the CP content of the decay D 0 \u2192 K 0 S K + K \u2212 in the region of the \u03c6 \u2192 K + K \u2212 resonance. The decay D 0 \u2192 K 0 S \u03c6 is a CPodd eigenstate and has been used as such in several analyses; see for example Refs. [21,22]. The \u03c6 \u2192 K + K \u2212 resonance is usually defined by a mass window about the nominal \u03c6 mass. Despite its narrow natural width of 4.26 MeV/c 2 [23], the potential contributions from CP -even final states beneath the \u03c6 resonance, such as D 0 \u2192 K 0 S a 0 (980) and non-resonant D 0 \u2192 K 0 S K + K \u2212 decays, must be accounted for. Using D 0 \u2192 K 0 S,L K + K \u2212 decays recoiling against CP eigenstates we determine the CP -odd fraction of decays, F \u2212 , in the region close to the \u03c6 resonance. A measurement of F \u2212 allows a systematic uncertainty related to the CP -even contamination to D 0 \u2192 K 0 S \u03c6 decays to be assigned without assuming an amplitude model for the decay D 0 \u2192 K 0 S K + K \u2212 . This paper is organized as follows. The formalism for the measurement of the strong-phase difference and F \u2212 is outlined in Sec. II. The choice of Dalitz-plot bins is given in Sec. III. The event selection is described in Sec. IV. Sections V and VI present the extraction of the variables associated with the strong-phase differences and the assignment of systematic uncertainties, respectively. The impact of these results on the measurement of \u03b3/\u03c6 3 is discussed in Sec. VII, along with the measurement of F \u2212 . A summary is given in Sec. VIII. Throughout this article the D 0 \u2192K 0 S \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and D 0 \u2192K 0 S K + K \u2212 analyses are described in parallel, but more weight is given to the latter as it has not been presented previously.",

This result will remain unbiased by the choice of an incorrect model, but will have less statistical sensitivity than expected.

However, the broad \u03c0\u03c0 and K\u03c0 S-wave components are not well described by such Breit-Wigner lineshapes. In particular an additional intermediate state, \u03c3 , is required to fit the \u03c0\u03c0 S-wave even though it is known not to be a physical resonance. Furthermore, parameterizing these broad overlapping states in terms of Breit-Wigner functions is unphysical in that unitarity can be violated. Therefore, a more recent BABAR model [12] uses the K-matrix [26] ansatz to parameterize the \u03c0\u03c0 S-wave contributions, which does not violate unitarity. In addition, the empirical LASS lineshape [27] of the K * 0 (1430) is used to improve the fit to the K\u03c0 S-wave component. We refer to this approach as the BABAR 2008 model. The reduced \u03c7 2 for the BABAR 2008 model fit to the D * + \u2192 D 0 \u03c0 + data is significantly improved over the first BABAR model [11] and is much better than that for the Belle model. Therefore, this model was considered the best available and is used to define the nominal binnings implemented in this analysis. The results of the model have been made available by the BABAR collaboration in the form of a lookup table of the amplitude and strong-phase difference, \u03b4 D , in a fine grid of 0.0054 GeV 2 /c 4 \u00d7 0.0054 GeV 2 /c 4 sub-bins of the Dalitz plot variables m 2",

[19] and was adapted to use the lookup table of the BABAR 2008 model. The optimization is iterative and starts from the equal \u2206\u03b4 D binning presented in Sec. III B 2. Each iteration starts with the random selection of a sub-bin from the lookup table. In 90% of iterations the sub-bin is first tested to see if it lies on the boundary of a bin. If the sub-bin is not at a boundary the next iteration begins. Otherwise the sub-bin is moved from its current assignment to that of the neighboring bin and the value of Q is computed with the new assignment. If the value of Q is increased by this migration, the new assignment for this bin is kept and the next iteration begins. If the value of Q does not increase the assignment reverts to that originally given and the next iteration begins. In 10% of iterations, the selected sub-bin is given an assignment at random, irrespective of whether it is on a bin boundary. Again the reassignment of the sub-bin is kept if there is an improvement in Q; this allows part of one bin to 'grow' inside another bin if there is an improvement in the sensitivity. The procedure terminates when no further significant increase in the value of Q can be found.",

The optimized Q value is 0.892, which is a 13% relative increase in sensitivity. However, there are many structures that are only a few sub-bins in size. Such regions are smaller than the experimental resolution and may result in systematic effects related to asymmetric migration of events from one bin to another. Furthermore, the position and shape of this fine structure depends critically on the components in the model, which may be realized differently in nature. Therefore, a smoothing procedure is implemented to remove these structures. The smoothing procedure starts by defining an 11\u00d711 square of sub-bins centred about the sub-bin that is being tested. The number of sub-bins with the same bin assignment as the central sub-bin within the square is found. If the fraction of sub-bins of the same assignment is less than 30% the subbin assignment is changed to the modal bin assignment within the square. This procedure is performed for each sub-bin with the bin assignments from the original optimization to prevent bias. The same optimization procedure is applied to the three D 0 \u2192 K 0 S K + K \u2212 binnings in terms of equal intervals of \u2206\u03b4 D .

The second type of background is where a D meson is reconstructed correctly, and is then subsequently combined with a random kaon candidate to form a B candidate. The reconstruction of the D 0 and D 0 is approximately equally likely and hence the distribution of this type of background in the i th bin will be proportional to (K i + K \u2212i ).

Therefore, to determine the possible impact on \u03b3/\u03c6 3 precision related to differences between the 2008 and 2010 models we compute the values of the respective figure of merit, Q or Q , for each BABAR model. This is done with the binnings fixed to those described above, which are derived from the BABAR 2008 model or the Belle model. The resulting figures of merit are given in Table I for the 2008 and 2010 BABAR models; the values of Q ( ) are also given when computed with the Belle model. The values of Q ( ) computed using the BABAR 2010 model are slightly smaller than those for the 2008 model, but the difference is never greater than 0.007. In comparison, when calculating Q ( ) with the Belle model, for binnings derived from the BABAR 2008 model, the decrease is between 0.018 and 0.030. Therefore, we conclude that using the BABAR 2008 model, rather than the BABAR 2010 model, to derive the binnings in this analysis will not result in a significant degradation in sensitivity to \u03b3/\u03c6 3 .",

EVTGEN [31] is used to generate the decays and GEANT [32] is used to simulate the CLEO-c detector response. Efficiency estimations are made on samples of signal events generated according to the D 0 \u2192 K 0 S K + K \u2212 resonance model reported in Ref. [12]. Separate signal samples are generated for each exclusive final state considered in the analysis and comprise 40,000 events per final state. Quantum correlations in the D 0 D 0 system are also simulated for each tag mode; this is particularly important for the CP -tagged D 0 decays. In addition a sample of generic DD decays corresponding to an integrated luminosity approximately 25 times greater than the data is used to estimate backgrounds. Quantum correlations are accounted for in the generic simulation. We adopt standard CLEO-c selection criteria for \u03c0 + , \u03c0 0 , and K 0 S mesons, which are described in Ref. [33]. The standard CLEO-c K + selection [33] is used for all final states apart from D 0 \u2192 K 0 S,L K + K \u2212 . For this final state, which has much smaller yields than K 0 S,L \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , the significance of the signal is found to increase if the impact parameter criteria are loosened by a factor of four and the requirement on the fraction of associated tracking chamber hits compared to the expectation is removed. We require candidate K 0 S \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decays to have a mass within 7.5 MeV/c 2 of the nominal mass and the K 0 S decay vertex is required to be separated from the interaction region by at least half a standard deviation. We reconstruct \u03b7 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 candidates in a similar fashion to \u03c0 0 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 candidates, with the requirement that the invariant mass is within 42 MeV/c 2 of the nominal mass; the same requirement is applied to \u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 candidates. Candidates for \u03c9 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 decays are required to be within 20 MeV/c 2 of the nominal \u03c9 mass.

For D 0 \u2192 K 0 L K + K \u2212 decays there are two significant peaking background contributions. The first source is D 0 \u2192 K 0 S K + K \u2212 decays where the K 0 S is not reconstructed, usually in the case where it decays to \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 . The second significant source is from D 0 \u2192 K + K \u2212 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 decays where both the \u03c0 0 daughters are not reconstructed and the missing mass corresponds to that of the K 0 L meson. This background is not strictly peaking in that the \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 invariant mass does not always correspond to that of the K 0 L meson. However, the missing-mass squared distribution for D 0 \u2192 K + K \u2212 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 background events determined from simulated data is not distributed linearly in the signal region and low missing-mass squared sideband, which would lead to a biased estimate of the background level if the sideband is used to determine the background level in the signal region. Therefore, the absolute level of this background is determined from the simulation and subtracted from both the signal and low missing-mass squared sideband. The D 0 \u2192 K 0 S K + K \u2212 and D 0 \u2192 K + K \u2212 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 peaking backgrounds are estimated to be 6.7% and 4.4% of the D 0 \u2192 K 0 L K + K \u2212 signal, respectively. Tag modes that contain a K 0 L , D 0 \u2192 K 0 L X, also have a significant peaking background from D 0 \u2192 K 0 S X decays where the K 0 S is not reconstructed. The peaking background to D 0 \u2192 K 0 L X events is between 4.0% and 6.9%. The estimated peaking backgrounds are subtracted from the measured yields. The differing CP eigenvalues of the D 0 \u2192 K 0 S X and D 0 \u2192 K 0 L X tags means that the distributions over Dalitz space of the signal and background can be significantly different. The effect of differing distributions of background is treated as a systematic uncertainty; the procedure to evaluate the uncertainty is described in Sec. VI B. The background to K + e \u2212 \u03bd events is estimated as 1.8% in the signal region, defined as U miss < 50 MeV.",

For final states containing a D 0 \u2192 K 0 S K + K \u2212 decay, the fit constrains the invariant mass of both the signal and tag D 0 meson candidates to be the nominal D 0 mass and the K 0 S daughters to the nominal K 0 S mass. For D 0 \u2192 K 0 L K + K \u2212 decays there are several stages to the fit. The first stage constrains both the D 0 daughter kaons in the D 0 \u2192 K 0 L K + K \u2212 decay to originate from a common vertex and the tag decay candidate to the D 0 mass. The second stage uses the resulting four-momenta to estimate the mass of the missing K 0 L meson. The energy of the K 0 L candidate is rescaled such that the invariant mass is the nominal K 0 L meson mass. In the final stage the K 0 L candidate and the daughter kaon pair are constrained to the nominal D 0 meson mass. The introduction of the kinematic fit improves the resolution on m 2 + and m 2 \u2212 by up to a factor of three for fully reconstructed K 0 S K + K \u2212 DT candidates. Although the fit only gives small improvements in core resolution for K 0 L final states there is a significant reduction in the number of events that lie in the non-Gaussian tails of the resolution distribution.",

However, an error in the previous analysis led to a small fraction (3.6%) of the data being excluded from the ST analysis of CP eigenstates. The updated yields are given in Table II. The selection requirements of DTs are identical to that in the previous analysis [7]. However, there are several changes to the yields reported. The same data excluded from the original ST analysis were missing from the evaluation of yields of final states containing a K 0 L candidate. 2 Also, the kinematic fit procedure described in Sec. IV A has also been applied to the K 0 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 events.

Also given are the predicted values for F (\u2212)i from the BABAR 2010 amplitude model of D 0 \u2192 K 0 S K + K \u2212 decays. The error on the predicted value of F (\u2212)i is determined from the uncertainties on the amplitude-model parameters. The agreement between the measured and predicted values is reasonable in all bins except F \u22121 , which is different by more than three standard deviations for all binnings. This discrepancy may be a statistical fluctuation or indicate a deficiency in the model in this region. In order to ascertain whether this effect can lead to a significant bias in our analysis, we perform the fit to determine c i with the predicted rather than measured values of K (\u2212)i ; the difference in fit results is negligible. Therefore, we conclude it is reasonable to use our measured values of K (\u2212)i to determine the parameters. Tables VII, VIII, IX, and X show the measured values of F (\u2212)i for the D 0 \u2192 K 0 S \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 data divided according to the optimal, BABAR 2008 model with equal \u2206\u03b4 D , modified-optimal, and Belle equal \u2206\u03b4 D binnings, respectively. Again these results are the average of pseudo-flavor and semileptonic tagged data. Predicted values are also given. In this case the uncertainty due to the amplitude-model parameters is negligible compared to the uncertainties on the measurements. The agreement between measured and predicted values is reasonable in all cases. We use the corrected and normalized values of the bin yields to determine c ( )",

Secondly, for CPeigenstate amplitudes, such as D 0 \u2192 K 0 S,L \u03c6, the D 0 \u2192 K 0 L h + h \u2212 amplitude can be related to the D 0 \u2192 K 0 S h + h \u2212 amplitude by multiplying the latter by a factor (1 \u2212 2re i\u03b4 ), where r is of the order tan 2 \u03b8 C and \u03b4 can take any value. Here, \u03b8 C is the Cabibbo angle. The origin of this factor is again related to the sign difference between DCS contributions to the D 0 \u2192 K 0 S h + h \u2212 and D 0 \u2192 K 0 L h + h \u2212 amplitudes, and is analogous to the mechanism which induces the difference in rates for D \u2192 K 0 S \u03c0 and D \u2192 K 0 L \u03c0 decay [35,39]. We determine central values of \u2206c i and \u2206s i by assuming r = tan 2 \u03b8 C [23] and \u03b4 = 0 \u2022 . Part of the uncertainty on \u2206c i and \u2206s i is evaluated by randomly choosing the assumed values of r and \u03b4 100 times, and recomputing the constraints for each set of parameters. The value of \u03b4 is assumed to have a equal probability to lie between 0 \u2022 and 360 \u2022 and that of r to have a Gaussian distribution of mean tan 2 \u03b8 C and width 0.5 \u00d7 tan 2 \u03b8 C . The RMS of the resulting distributions of \u2206c i and \u2206s i are taken as the uncertainties from this source. A second source of uncertainty is related to the model choice. For the D 0 \u2192 K 0 S K + K \u2212 model this is estimated by varying the isobar model parameters by their uncertainties [14], accounting for any correlations among the parameters [24], then recomputing \u2206c i and \u2206s i . The differences with respect to the values of the constraints computed with the nominal values of the parameters are taken as the uncertainty on \u2206c i and \u2206s i from this source. For D 0 \u2192 K 0 S \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 we follow Ref. [7] and consider two alternative models [10,40] to determine \u2206c i and \u2206s i ; the largest deviation of the central value from that computed with the default model [11] is taken as a systematic uncertainty. As examples of the constraints found by this procedure, the values of \u2206c i and \u2206s i for the N = 3 division of the D 0 \u2192 K 0 S K + K \u2212 Dalitz plot and the optimal binning of the D 0 \u2192 K 0 S \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 Dalitz plot are given in Tables XI and XII, respectively. The size of \u2206c i and \u2206s i can be significant for bins dominated by either a DCS decay, such as the K * + (892) in bin three of the optimal D 0 \u2192 K 0 S \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 binning (Fig. 3(b)), or a neutral resonance, such as the a 0 (1450) in bin three of the N = 3 division of the D 0 \u2192 K 0 S K + K \u2212 Dalitz plot (Fig. 2). The contribution of the \u03c7 2 to the likelihood is investigated to ensure that these constraints are not leading to any significant bias. For the fits to the ranges of \u03c7 2 are 0.30 to 0.75 and 1.0 to 2.3, respectively. In addition, no individual bin contributes more than 0.9 to the total \u03c7 2 . Therefore, we conclude that the constraint is not biasing our result significantly from the values favored by the data, and is principally improving the precision of the parameters.",

In the K 0 S \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 analysis the ST yields are used apart from the two final states that contain unreconstructed particles in the tag candidate (K \u2212 e + \u03bd and K 0 L \u03c0 0 ). In addition, previous investigations [33]  have determined that there are small differences in the particle-reconstruction efficiency between data and the MC. These differences lead to systematic uncertainties, and in some cases corrections, for final states in which K 0 S,L h + h \u2212 is normalized using the branching fraction and the N D 0 D 0 ; when using ST yields to normalize, these corrections and uncertainties cancel. The reconstruction efficiency of each final-state containing a \u03c0 0 or an \u03b7 meson must be corrected. The DT efficiency has an uncertainty for each final-state particle reconstructed due to the MC modeling. These uncertainties are: 0.3% per \u03c0 + , 0.6% per K + , 1.3% per \u03c0 0 , 4% per \u03b7, 0.9% per K 0 S , and 3% per K 0 L candidates. If a final state contains two particles of the same type the uncertainty on each identical particle is treated as fully correlated. The uncertainties on the ST yields, branching fractions, N D 0 D 0 , and particle reconstruction efficiency are used to estimate the systematic uncertainty from the mode-to-mode normalization method.",

The uncertainty varies significantly between the different binnings. For the equal \u2206\u03b4 D binning derived from the BABAR 2008 model, we find an induced uncertainty of 2.0 \u2022 , whereas for the optimal-binning it is 3.9 \u2022 . These variations reflect the limited statistics available with which to determine c i and s i in some of the optimal bins; these are the same bins that lead to the reduced statistical performance in determining \u03b3 from the optimal binning in the presence of background. This is further emphasized by the expected uncertainty on \u03b3/\u03c6 3 from the modified-optimal binning results being 2.1 \u2022 . The values of c i and s i measured for the equal \u2206\u03b4 D binning derived from the Belle model lead to a 1.7 \u2022 uncertainty on \u03b3/\u03c6 3 . In all cases the error on the predicted uncertainty is less than 0.1 \u2022 and the contribution of the systematic uncertainties on c i and s i is approximately 1.3 \u2022 .

The optimal and the modified-optimal binnings have been optimized to minimize the statistical uncertainty on \u03b3/\u03c6 3 in the absence of background and with the anticipated background at LHCb [16], respectively. The impact of these binnings on B data can be assessed by comparing them to the equal \u2206\u03b4 D binning derived from the BABAR 2008 model using simulated B data samples. We generate simplified MC samples of 5000 B \u00b1 \u2192 K \u00b1 D 0 signal events which corresponds to the expected yield with 2 fb \u22121 of LHCb data. The statistical uncertainties on \u03b3/\u03c6 3 are 8.0 \u2022 and 7.0 \u2022 for the equal \u2206\u03b4 D and optimal binnings, respectively. This demonstrates the advantage in using the optimized binning, and the improvement is consistent with the increase in the Q quantity given in Table I. We also generate samples that include background events with yields according to the LHCb background model described in Sec. III B 4. We find the statistical uncertainties on \u03b3/\u03c6 3 of 15.0 \u2022 , 15.4 \u2022 , and 14.6 \u2022 for the equal \u2206\u03b4 D , optimal and modified-optimal binning, respectively.

The measurements presented here benefit from an improved analysis procedure and bin choices informed by an amplitude model developed by the BABAR collaboration [12] which provides a better description of Dalitz space than was previously available. We have given results for bin choices made with an equal division in strong-phase difference ('equal \u2206\u03b4 D ') and for a division which optimizes the foreseen precision on \u03b3/\u03c6 3 in a low background environment ('optimal'), as expected at an e + e \u2212 experiment, and for one ('modified optimal') which gives the best result under the background conditions anticipated at a hadron-collider experiment such as LHCb. Results have also been presented for an equal \u2206\u03b4 D binning based on an amplitude model devised by the Belle collaboration [13]. We estimate the uncertainty on \u03b3/\u03c6 3 to be between 1.7 \u2022 and 3.9 \u2022 , depending on the binning, due to the uncertainties on the measured values of c i and s i . In most cases, this uncertainty is smaller than that due to the D 0 \u2192 K 0 S \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 amplitude model in the most recent analyses [13,14]. The results for D 0 \u2192 K 0 S K + K \u2212 are the first measurements of c ( ) i and s ( ) i for this decay. They have been given for equal \u2206\u03b4 D divisions of Dalitz space based on the amplitude model found in Ref. [14] for each half of the Dalitz plot divided into two, three and four bins. The uncertainty on \u03b3/\u03c6 3 from the error on c i and s i parameters is between 3.2 \u2022 and 3.9 \u2022 depending on the binnings; these uncertainties are comparable to those related to the amplitude model in the unbinned analysis [14].",
