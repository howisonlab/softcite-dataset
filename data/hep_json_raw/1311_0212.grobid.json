In light of the recent precision measurements of \u03b813, we consider the sensitivity of these measurements in a study to determine the optimal baseline, including practical considerations regarding beam and detector performance. We conclude that a detector at a baseline of at least 1000 km in a wide-band muon neutrino beam is the optimal configuration.",

            "text": "Experimental observations [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11] have shown that neutrinos have mass and undergo flavor oscillations due to mixing between the mass states and flavor states. For three neutrino flavors, the mixing can be described by three mixing angles (\u03b8 12 , \u03b8 13 , \u03b8 23 ) and one CP-violating phase parameter (\u03b4 CP ). The probability for flavor os-cillations also depends on the differences in the squared masses of the neutrinos, \u2206m 2 21 and \u2206m 2 31 , where \u2206m 2 ij \u2261 m 2 i \u2212 m 2 j and \u2206m 2 31 = \u2206m 2 32 + \u2206m 2 21 . Five of the parameters governing neutrino oscillations have been measured: all three mixing angles and the magnitude of the two independent mass squared differences. Because the sign of \u2206m 2 31 is not known, there are two possibilities for the ordering of the neutrino masses, called the mass hierarchy: m 1 < m 2 < m 3 (\"normal hierarchy\") or m 3 < m 1 < m 2 (\"inverted hierarchy\"). The value of the CP-violating phase \u03b4 CP is unknown. Another remaining question is the octant of \u03b8 23 : measured values of sin 2 (2\u03b8 23 ) are close to 1 [1,3,5], but the data are so far inconclusive as to whether \u03b8 23 is less than or greater than 45 \u2022 , the value for maximal mixing between \u03bd \u00b5 and \u03bd \u03c4 .",

However, long-baseline experiments seek not only to measure the parameter, but to explicitly demonstrate CP violation by observing the asymmetry between neutrinos and antineutrinos. Additionally, a comparison of the measured value of \u03b4 CP based on neutrino data alone to that based on the combined fit of neutrino and antineutrino data will be a useful crosscheck. Figure 2 shows the asymmetry for different baselines calculated at both the first and second oscillation maxima, since only these two maxima are accessible in practical accelerator experiments. The asymmetry is shown assuming only matter effects (\u03b4 CP = 0) or only maximal \u03b4 CP effects (in vacuum). The matter asymmetry grows as a function of baseline, and therefore distinguishing the normal and inverted hierarchies by measuring neutrino and antineutrino events becomes easier as the baseline increases, as long as the number of appearance events stays constant. The asymmetry due to nonzero \u03b4 CP is constant as a function of baseline at both the first and second oscillation maximum. At the first oscillation maximum, the maximum CP asymmetry is larger than the matter asymmetry only for baselines less than \u223c1000 km. However, at the second oscillation maximum, the maximal CP asymmetry dominates the matter asymmetry at all baselines. The second oscillation maximum therefore has good sensitivity to CP violation, independent of the mass hierarchy. At short baselines, the second oscillation maximum occurs at an energy that isn't observable. Therefore at short baselines, any observed asymmetry could be due to either the matter effect or CP violation at the first oscillation maximum; additional information is needed to determine the cause of the asymmetry. At longer baselines with a wide-band beam, the ambiguity at the first oscillation maximum can be resolved using the information from the second oscillation maximum.",

The positively charged pions are focused in the forward direction by a toroidal magnetic field generated by magnetic horns. The pions are then allowed to decay to produce a muon neutrino beam. At the end of the decay region an absorber stops the remaining secondary particles from the initial proton collision, and the muons produced in the decay pipe are stopped in rock located beyond the absorber. A muon antineutrino beam can be created by reversing the magnetic field to focus negatively charged pions. Horn-focused beams are technologically well-matched to long-baseline experiments with neutrino energy > 1 GeV since horn focusing is optimal for focusing hadrons > 2 GeV and can be used effectively to charge-select the focused hadrons. In this study, we use the simulated flux from horn-focused beams to evaluate the sensitivity of long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments at different baselines. In this section, we discuss the expected dependence of the electron neutrino appearance rate on baseline, making ideal flux assumptions and ignoring any detector effects for simplicity.",

            "text": "For real neutrino beams generated from pion decays in flight, it is not possible to produce a neutrino flux that is constant over a large range of energies. Hadron production from the proton target and decay kinematics due to the finite decay volume will produce a reduced neutrino flux at higher energies when a fixed proton beam energy is used. The lower flux at higher energies, and hence longer baselines, will counteract the event rate increase from the matter effect (assuming a neutrino beam and normal hierarchy). This effect is illustrated in Figure 3. We calculate the \u03bd e appearance event rate integrated over the region of the first two oscillation maxima using the appearance probability given by Equation 1 assuming a constant flux or a horn-focused beam with a perfect-focusing system. For the constant flux assumption, we use Equation 6 with C \u2248 1.2 \u00d7 10 17 \u03bd \u00b5 /m 2 /GeV/(MW-yr) as before. The results from this more detailed calculation are comparable to Equation 11 and illustrate the slowly varying dependence on baseline. Figure 4 shows separately the event rate in each of the first two oscillation maxima assuming the flux obtained from a perfect-focusing system with a fixed decay pipe length. With perfect focusing, the event rate in the region of the second oscillation maximum is relatively constant for baselines greater than 1200 km. Therefore, based on these considerations, we don't expect the sensitivity to CP violation to increase as a function of baseline, but remain roughly the same. The event rate in the region of the first maximum decreases with baseline due to the decreasing flux from the beam and increasing impact from the matter asymmetry. For longer baselines, the decrease in flux in the region of the first maximum can be ameliorated by using longer decay pipes to increase the number of pion decays at higher energy.",

With a lower proton energy, the integrated rates in the first and second oscillation maxima are more similar, and the second maximum contributes greatly to the CP violation sensitivity. At 120 GeV however, the rates at the first maximum dominate at all baselines in neutrino mode (shown in Figure  4), and accessing the second maximum by going to longer baselines is unlikely to yield significant enhancements to the sensitivity. The optimal baseline therefore depends on the energy of the primary proton beam.

            "text": "The signal of muon (anti)neutrino to electron (anti)neutrino oscillations is an excess of \u03bd e or\u03bd e chargedcurrent (CC) interactions over background. \u03bd e (\u03bd e ) CC events are identified by the e \u2212 (e + ) in the final state. An irreducible background is caused by \u03bd e and\u03bd e intrinsic to the beam, most of which are created by decays of kaons and muons in the decay region. Neutral-current (NC) interactions create background when the hadronic shower has an electromagnetic component, often caused by the decay of \u03c0 0 s. \u03bd \u00b5 CC interactions create background when the final state muon is not identified. Due to \u03bd \u00b5 \u2192 \u03bd \u03c4 oscillations, there is background contribution from \u03bd \u03c4 CC interactions in which the decay products of the \u03c4 mimic a signal event. We expect that additional kinematic cuts can be applied to the selected sample to reduce the background from \u03bd \u03c4 CC interactions without a significant loss of signal events. In this study we consider two cases: the maximum \u03bd \u03c4 CC background assuming no background reduction is possible and zero \u03bd \u03c4 CC background assuming it can be completely eliminated with no reduction in signal. The \u03bd \u03c4 CC background is most important for the longer baseline configurations (>1500 km), in which a significant portion of the neutrino flux has energy above the \u03c4 production threshold.",

However, in the antineutrino-beam mode, the wrong-sign (neutrino) contamination is much more substantial, and is therefore included in this study. Ratio of the \u03bde appearance signal spectra used in this study to the appearance spectra obtained assuming perfect hadron focusing for baselines of 1000, 2000, and 3000 km. The solid horizontal lines show the energy region around the first maximum, where the limits are the energies above and below the first maximum at which the appearance probability is 50% of the maximum. The dashed horizontal lines show the energy region around the second maximum, where the limits are the energies above and below the second maximum at which the appearance probability is 10% of the maximum. As a reference, we use a liquid argon (LAr) TPC with an exposure of 350 kt-MW-yr (which roughly corresponds to a 6-year exposure of a 50-kt detector in a 1.2-MW beam). Our results, however, can be easily extrapolated to other combinations of detector size and beam intensity. Parameters describing the selection efficiency and detector energy response were input into the GLoBES software package [21,22] to calculate and analyze the predicted spectra. The detector performance parameters used for the study are shown in Table II. Most of these parameters are derived from studies of LAr TPC simulations and studies of the ICARUS detector performance [23][24][25][26]. The NC true-to-visible energy conversion is based on a fast MC simulation developed for LBNE [27,28], a planned experiment which will use a muon neutrino beam to study electron neutrino appearance. The MC uses flux simulations (derived from GEANT3 beamline simulations as previously described) and the GENIE event generator [29] to generate neutrino interactions on argon. Events can be classified as \u03bd e CC-like based on event-level reconstructed quantities. The \u03bd \u03c4 CC background energy-dependent mis-identification rate and true-to-visible energy conversion is also calculated based on the fast MC.",

However, unambiguous determination of the mass hierarchy for all possible values of \u03b4 CP is very difficult for existing electron neutrino appearance experiments because of the degeneracy between the matter and CP asymmetries. The electron neutrino appearance and reactor antineutrino disappearance methods are complementary, so it is preferable to make both measurements. Therefore, the mass hierarchy sensitivity is still a relevant consideration in choosing the optimal baseline.",

The significance of the CP violation measurement is defined as \u03c3 = \u2206\u03c7 2 . Figure 16 shows the fraction of all possible true \u03b4 CP values for which we can exclude CP-conserving values of \u03b4 CP with a sensitivity of at least 3\u03c3 (\u2206\u03c7 2 = 9) as a function of baseline, for both normal and inverted hierarchy. In these plots we assume that the true hierarchy is unknown by considering both hierarchy solutions in the minimization. The maximum sensitivity to CP violation is achieved for baselines between 750 km and 1500 km, with the very short baselines having the worst sensitivity. If the maximum \u03bd \u03c4 CC background is included, the sensitivity decreases for very long baselines. The shaded band shows the possible range in the fraction due to the uncertainty in the other oscillation parameters, dominated by the uncertainty in \u03b8 23 . Both octant solutions for \u03b8 23 are considered by the shaded region. Figure 17 shows CP violation sensitivities in plots sim-ilar to Figure 16, in which we assume that the true hierarchy is known and consider only those solutions corresponding to the true hierarchy in the minimization. Knowing the mass hierarchy significantly increases the CP violation sensitivity at shorter baselines. This effect is illustrated in Figure 18, which shows the significance as a function of the true value of \u03b4 CP for 300 km, 750 km, and 1300 km baselines. The shorter baselines do not have the advantage of the large CP asymmetry in the second oscillation maximum and therefore the CP measurement at short baselines suffers from the ambigu- ity of the matter asymmetry and the CP asymmetry in the first oscillation maximum. If the hierarchy is known, this ambiguity is removed. The differences in sensitivity among the baselines are smaller when the mass hierarchy is known, but, as noted in the previous section, an unambiguous measurement of the mass hierarchy using electron neutrino appearance will remain a high priority.",
