Given that a jet has been identified as likely resulting from the hadronic decay of a boosted W or Z boson, this paper presents a technique for further differentiating Z bosons from W bosons. The variables used are jet mass, jet charge, and a b-tagging discriminant. A likelihood tagger is constructed from these variables and tested in the simulation of W \u2192 W Z for bosons in the transverse momentum range 200 GeV < p T < 400 GeV in \u221a s = 8 TeV pp collisions with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. For Zboson tagging efficiencies of Z = 90, 50, and 10 %, one can achieve W + -boson tagging rejection factors (1/ W + ) of 1.7, 8.3 and 1000, respectively. It is not possible to measure these efficiencies in the data due to the lack of a pure sample of high p T , hadronically decaying Z bosons. However, the modelling of the tagger inputs for boosted W bosons is studied in data using a tt-enriched sample of events in 20.3 fb \u22121 of data at \u221a s = 8 TeV. The inputs are well modelled within uncertainties, which builds confidence in the expected tagger performance.",

            "text": "Processes involving the production and decay of W and Z bosons provide benchmarks for testing the Standard Model (SM), as well as probes of physics beyond the SM (BSM). Since the cross section for the direct strong production of events with multiple jets (QCD multijets) at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is much larger than for W and Z boson production, it is usually the case that the leptonic decays of bosons must be used to reduce the overwhelming background. However, when the momentum p V of a boson V is comparable with its mass, m V , the spatial proximity of the decay products provides a new set of tools that can be e-mail: atlas.publications@cern.ch used to distinguish between jets from hadronic boson decays and jets originating from QCD multijet backgrounds. In particular, since the angle between the decay products of a boson V scales with 2m V / p V , for large p V , jet substructure techniques become powerful tools. This leads to a tradeoff between using relatively pure leptonic decays and highbranching-ratio hadronic decays. In some BSM theories, new particles similar to W/Z bosons do not couple directly to leptons, so searching for hadronic decays of heavy particles is essential.",

First, a type tagger could enhance the SM physics program with W and Z bosons in the final state. Measurements of this kind include the determination of the cross sections for V +jets, V V , and tt + V . Another important use of a boson-type tagger is in searches for flavour-changing neutral currents (FCNC). Due to the Glashow-Iliopoulos-Maiani (GIM) mechanism [4], FCNC processes in the SM are highly suppressed. Many models of new physics predict large enhancements to such processes. Both ATLAS and CMS have performed searches for FCNC [5,6] of the form t \u2192 Zq in the leptonic channels, but these could be extended by utilizing the hadronic Z decays as well. FCNC processes mediated by a leptophobic Z such as t \u2192 Z q may be detected only via hadronic type-tagging methods. A third use of a boson-type tagger is to categorize the properties of new physics, if discovered at the LHC.",

            "text": "Labelling jets as originating from a W or Z boson is less ambiguous than quark/gluon labelling. A W boson can radiate a Z boson, just like a quark can radiate a gluon, but this is heavily suppressed for the former and not for the latter. The radiation pattern of jets from W -and Z -bosons is less topology dependent because it is largely independent of the other radiation in the event as W and Z bosons are colour singlets. Aside from the production cross section and subtle differences in differential decay distributions, the only features that distinguish between W and Z bosons are their mass, charge, and branching ratios. Experimentally, this means that the only variables that are useful in discriminating between hadronic decays of W and Z bosons are those which are sensitive to these properties. The three variables used in the analysis presented here are jet mass, sensitive to the boson mass, jet charge, sensitive to the boson charge, and a btagging discriminant which is sensitive to the heavy-flavour decay branching fractions of the bosons. The application of a boson-type tagger in practice will be accompanied by the prior use of a boson tagger (to reject QCD multijet processes). The type-tagger variables are largely independent of typical boson-tagger discriminants like n-subjettiness [7], which rely on the two-prong hard structure of both the W and Z decays. 2 This paper introduces a jet tagging method to distinguish between hadronically decay W and Z bosons at the LHC, and documents its performance with the ATLAS detector at \u221a s = 8 TeV. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the simulated datasets used in constructing and evaluating the boson-type tagger. Following a discussion of the differences between the properties of W and Z bosons in Sect. 3, Sect. 4 defines the three discriminating variables. The construction and performance of the tagger are detailed in Sect. 5 and the sensitivity to systematic uncertainties is described in Sect. 6. The input variables are studied in a dataset enriched in boosted W bosons in Sect. 7. The paper ends with a discussion of possible uses of the tagger in Sect. 8 and conclusions in Sect. 9.",

The Breit-Wigner resonance curves for W and Z bosons are shown in Fig. 1a. The separation between the curves is a theoretical limit on how well mass-sensitive variables can distinguish between W and Z bosons. For hadronic boson decays, the mass peaks measured with jets are broader. This is because the jet-clustering algorithm for final-state hadrons loses parti-cles at large angles to the jet axis and includes extra particles from the underlying event and pileup.",

The distributions are different for right-and left-handed fermions for transversely polarized W and Z bosons, as shown in Fig. 1b. The relative contribution of left-and right-handed components for the Z decays depends on the quark flavour; for up-type quarks the relative contribution from right-handed fermions is 15 % while it is only 3 % for down-type quarks.

[3]. There are small differences in performance between transversely and longitudinally polarized bosons, but any differences are less relevant for W versus Z tagging where the angular distributions are identical for longitudinally polarized bosons and only slightly differ for transversely polarized bosons. 4 ATLAS uses a right-handed coordinate system with its origin at the nominal interaction point (IP) in the centre of the detector and the z-axis along the beam pipe. The x-axis points from the IP to the centre of the LHC ring, and the y-axis points upward. Polar coordinates (r, \u03c6) are used in the transverse plane, \u03c6 being the azimuthal angle around the beam pipe. The pseudorapidity is defined in terms of the polar angle \u03b8 as \u03b7 = \u2212ln tan(\u03b8/2). Transverse momentum and energy are defined in the x-y plane as p T = p \u2022 sin(\u03b8) and E T = E \u2022 sin(\u03b8). decay products of boosted bosons is measured by a system of calorimeters. The electromagnetic calorimeter consists of a Pb/liquid-argon sampling calorimeter split into barrel (|\u03b7| < 1.5) and endcap (1.5 < |\u03b7| < 3.2) sections. The hadronic calorimetry is provided by a barrel steel/scintillating-tile calorimeter (|\u03b7| < 1.7) and two endcap Cu/liquid-argon sections (1.5 < |\u03b7| < 3.2). Finally, the forward region (3.1 < |\u03b7| < 4.9) is covered by a liquid-argon calorimeter with Cu (W) absorber in the electromagnetic (hadronic) section. Energy depositions are grouped into topological calorimeter-cell clusters [34] and then calibrated using the local cluster weighting algorithm [35,36]. Jets are formed from clusters using two different jet algorithms. Small-radius jets are built with the anti-k t algorithm with jet radius parameter R = 0.4 [37]. Large-radius jets are formed using the anti-k t algorithm with R = 1.0 and then trimmed [38] by re-clustering the jet constituents with the k t algorithm using R = 0.3 and removing the constituents with p T less than 5 % of the original jet p T . Both the small-and large-radius jets are further calibrated to account for the residual detector response effects. For small-radius jets, this is a p T -and \u03b7-dependent energy calibration, plus a correction to mitigate the contribution from additional pp collisions and to suppress jets from these additional collisions [39]. In addition to p T -and \u03b7-dependent energy corrections, large-radius jets J have a calibrated jet mass:",

This is useful for bosontype tagging because the Z boson couples to bb while decays of the W boson to b-quarks are highly suppressed and can be neglected. ATLAS has commissioned a b-tagging algorithm called MV1 (defined in Refs. Small-radius jets are matched to a large-radius jet by geometric matching 5 ( R < 1.0). Of all such small-radius jets, the two leading ones are considered. There are thus 30 possible bins of combined MV1 when considering the leading and sub-leading matched small-radius jet. The number of bins is 25 from the 5 \u00d7 5 efficiency-binned MV1 distributions in addition to five more for the case in which there is no second small-radius jet matched to the large-radius jet. The distribution for the efficiency-binned MV1 variable for the leading and sub-leading matched small-radius jets is shown for W and Z bosons in Fig. 4. The flavour of a small-radius jet is defined as the type of the highest energy parton from the parton shower record within R < 0.4. As expected, a clear factorization is seen in Fig. 4 -the MV1 value depends on the flavour of the small-radius jet and not the process that created it. This means that c-jets from W decays have the same MV1 distribution as c-jets from Z decays; the same is true for light jets. Small-radius jets originating from b-hadron decays tend to have a larger value of MV1, which means they fall in a lower efficiency bin. Small-radius jets not originating from bor c-decays are called light jets and are strongly peaked in the most efficient bin of MV1. There is always one small-radius jet matched to the large-radius jet, but about 20 % of the time there is no sub-leading small-radius jet with p T > 25 GeV  matched to the large-radius jets.

Populating all of these bins with sufficient MC events to produce templates for the likelihood ratio requires an unreasonable amount of computing resources, especially for the high-efficiency bins of combined MV1. Estimating the 3D likelihood as the product of the 1D marginal distributions, where all variables but the one under consideration are integrated out, is a poor approximation for jet mass and combined MV1 due to the correlation induced by the presence of semileptonic b-decays, which shift the jet mass to lower values due to the presence of unmeasured neutrinos. 6 It is still possible to use a simple product by noting that all three tagger inputs are independent when the flavour of the decaying boson has been determined. Thus, for each possible boson decay channel, templates are built for the jet mass, the jet charge, and the efficiency-binned MV1 distributions. For a particular decay flavour, the joint distribution 6 The muons from semileptonic decays are added back to the jet using a four-momentum sum. Muons are measured by the combination of a dedicated muon spectrometer with its own toroidal magnetic field outside the calorimeters, and the inner detector.

Bins are then sorted from largest to smallest s i /b i , with f (i) defining a map from the old bin index to the new, sorted one. There are then two 1D histograms: for the signal, bin j has bin content s f \u22121 ( j) and for the background, bin j has bin content b f \u22121 ( j) . The optimal tagging procedure is then to set a threshold on the new 1D histograms. The full likelihood ratio of the combined tagger is shown in Fig. 6 where the thresholds required for 90, 50, and 10 % Z -boson tagging efficiency are marked with shaded regions. Curves displaying the tagging performance for all possible subsets of {M, Q, B} are shown in Fig. 7. There are 30 possible values for B, which are therefore represented by discrete points. The jet mass is the best performing single variable for medium to high Z -boson efficiencies, with visible improvement for M+B and M+Q. There is a significant gain from combining all three variables for Z -boson tagging efficiency above about 20 %. Below 20 %, the combined tagger is dominated by B where the Z \u2192 bb branching fraction no longer limits Z -boson tagging efficiency. For Z -boson efficiencies of about 50 %, one can achieve W + rejection factors (1/ W + ) of 3.3 by using Q or B alone and about 5.0 using mass alone. For Z efficiencies of Z = 90, 50, and 10 %, W + rejection factors of 1.7, 8.3, and 1000, respectively, can be achieved with the combined tagger. Although most applications of boson-type tagging will target Z bosons as the signal while rejecting W bosons as background, the likelihood constructed in Fig. 6 can also be used to optimally distinguish W + bosons from Z bosons. The corresponding performance curves are shown in Fig. 8. The locations of the b-tagging points are all now shifted to high efficiency with respect to Fig. 7 because, for W + tagging, one wants to operate in the high-efficiency b-tagging bins (whereas the opposite is optimal for Z tagging).

Tracks associated with a jet are well measured and provide an independent observable correlated with the jet energy. Uncertainties on the jet-mass resolution can have a non-negligible impact on the performance of the tagger. The jet-mass resolution uncertainty is determined from the difference in the widths of the boosted W boson jet-mass peak in semileptonic tt simulated and measured data events [45] and also from varying the simulation according to its systematic uncertainties [46]. The resolution is about 5 GeV in the Gaussian core of the mass spectrum and its uncertainty is about 20 %. The impact of the jet-mass scale and resolution uncertainties on the boson-type tagger built using only the jet mass is shown in Fig. 9 for two nominal working points of 50 and 90 % Z -boson tagging efficiency. Both the likelihood map f from Sect. 5 and the threshold value are fixed. Inputs to the tagger are shifted by their uncertainties and the 1D histograms described above are re-populated. The efficiencies for W and Z bosons are recomputed and shown as markers in Fig. 9a. Coherent shifts of the jet masses (JMS) for W and Z bosons result in movement along the nominal performance curve corresponding to \u00b110 % changes in the efficiency. However, there are also shifts away from the nominal curve because the optimal jet-mass cut is not a simple threshold. Variation of the jet-mass resolution (JMR) preserves the scale and so the movement is nearly perpendicular to the original performance curve, at the 5 % level, because of the increased overlap in the Z and W mass distributions. 8 Shifts along the nominal curve optimally use the input variables (albeit at different efficiencies), while shifts away from the nominal curve are a degradation in the performance. The impact of the fragmentation is estimated by using input variables from HERWIG but with the likelihood map from PYTHIA. PYTHIA and HERWIG have similar W/Z efficiencies at both the 50 and 90 % benchmark points.",

Conversely, the c-and light-jet scale factor uncertainties do not impact the Z bosons because at this low efficiency, all the selected Z bosons decay into bb loss is expected to be negligible for jets with p T < 400 GeV. Differences in the modelling of fragmentation can affect the expected performance for all the input variables, especially for the track-dependent observables. The impact of various uncertainties on the boson-type tagger built using only the jet charge is shown in Fig. 9b.

The ratio uses the positive lepton charge. b The median of the jet charge distribution as a function of the jet p T . This includes the contributions from events that are not classified as Boosted W (except for the blue triangles, for which only the Boosted W is included). c The inter-quartile range as a measure of the width. The quantiles are centred at the median. The uncertainty band includes all the experimental uncertainties on the jet p T and jet mass described in Sect. 6. The inter-quantile range is defined as the difference between the 75 % quantile and the 25 % quantile. Statistical uncertainty bars are included on the data points but are smaller than the markers in many bins in Sect. 6, but exclude tracking uncertainties, which are subdominant. Events are vetoed if the selected large-radius jet has p T > 400 GeV or if the R between the selected largeradius jet and a tagged b-jet is less than 1.0. This suppresses the b-contaminated tt events. The effectiveness of the tt event classification is most easily seen from the jet mass distribution, shown in Fig. 13a. The mass of the boosted W bosons from tt events is peaked around m W , as is a small contribu-tion from the hadronically decaying W bosons in single-top events in the W t channel. There is no peak at m t in the bcontaminated spectrum because of the b-jet veto, but there is a small non-resonant contribution below the top-quark mass, due to events in which one W daughter is matched with the b-jet. This is akin to the b-jet+lepton invariant mass used in other circumstances to measure top-quark properties and naturally has a scale around 150 GeV in W +jets and the 'other' tt events is due to the Sudakov peak from QCD jets, the location of which scales with R \u00d7 p T . The dependence on p T of the W -peak position in Fig. 13a is shown in Fig. 13b. Events with the leading jet in a window around the W mass, 50 GeV < m jet < 120 GeV are selected and the median of the mass distribution is plotted in Fig. 13b as a function of the jet p T . The similar trend for the simulation and the data shows that the combination of the reconstructed jet-mass scale and 'truth' jet-mass scale is well modelled. To quantify the spread in the jet mass peak, various inter-quantile ranges are shown as a function of p T in Fig. 13c. The inter-quantile range of size 0 % < X < 50 % is defined as the difference between the 50 % + X % quantile and the 50 % \u2212 X % quantile, and is a measure of the spread in the distribution. The width of the boosted-W mass peak is well modelled within the statistical precision of the 2012 data sample. The modelling of boosted W bosons can also be studied using the jet-mass scale measured from tracks. Defining the variable r track as the ratio of the jet mass determined from tracks to the jet mass determined from the calorimeter, the jet mass scale uncertainty is related to the difference from unity of the ratio of r track in data to r track in MC simulation. The mass scale uncertainty is calculated using the procedure described above, but with r \u22121 track . If the jet consists only of pions, the natural scale for r track is 2/3, although there are significant physics and detector effects that introduce a large spread of values. The distribution of r track in the tt-enriched event sample with the same p T and b-jet veto requirements as in Fig. 13 is shown in Fig. 14a. Unlike the raw jet-mass distribution, the r track distribution is similar for all of the sub-processes, as expected. The scale and spread of the r track distribution are quantified in Fig. 14b, c using the p T dependence of the median and inter-quantile ranges. Previous studies have indicated that the track multiplicity, n track , in quark and gluon jets is not well modelled, especially for gluon jets, where n track is lower in the data with respect to PYTHIA [50]. The distribution of the track multiplicity for large-R jets in the tt-enriched event sample is shown in Fig. 15. The boosted W events are peaked at slightly lower values of the number of associated tracks compared to the quark/gluon jets from the other processes. The (charged) particle multiplicity increases for generic quark and gluon jets as a function of jet energy. However, the mass-scale of the jets produced from W boson decays is set by m W so that in the absence of detector reconstruction effects, the track multiplicity distribution should be largely p T independent. The p T dependence of the track multiplicity is shown in Fig. 15b, c in the form of the median and the inter-quantile ranges. The median does increase because of the large non-W component as well as the finite detector The p T -weighted distribution of the track charges defines the jet charge, which is shown in Fig. 16a. The charge of the lepton from the leptonic W boson decay determines the expected charge of the hadronically decaying W boson candidate, allowing for a tag-and-probe study of the capability of charge tagging in hadronic W boson decays [42]. The jet charge for boosted W bosons for positively (negatively) charged leptons is clearly shifted to the left (right) of zero. There is also some separation between positive and negative W boson decays when the selected large-radius jet does not satisfy the criteria for being a boosted W boson. This is because the jet still contains some of the W boson decay products, and the jet charge is correlated with the charge of the W boson. The difference between the inclusive and boosted W -boson jets is clearer in the p T dependence plot of the median jet charge shown in Fig. 16b. The medians of the distributions for boosted W jets are nearly twice as far apart as the medians for inclusive jets. However, in both cases the spread is less than the width of the distribution, shown as the inter-quantile range (inter-quantile range with X = 25 %) in Fig. 16c. Even though there is some small disagreement for the median number of tracks, the p T -weighted sum defining the jet charge is reasonably well modelled.",

            "text": "A tagger for distinguishing hadronically decaying boosted Z bosons from W bosons using the ATLAS detector has been presented. It will most likely be used after a boson tagger has rejected most QCD multijet events. Three discriminating variables are chosen which are sensitive to the differences in boson mass, charge, and branching ratios to specific quark flavours: large-radius jet mass, large-radius jet charge, and an associated small-radius jet b-tagging discriminant. For moderate and high Z -boson tagging efficiencies, the jet mass is the most discriminating of the three variables, but there is significant improvement in discrimination when combining all three inputs into a single tagger. At low Z -boson efficiencies, smaller than the Z \u2192 bb branching ratio, the b-tagging discriminant is the most useful for rejecting W bosons. The full tagger is largely unaffected by many systematic uncertainties on the inputs, with the exception of the uncertainties on the jet-mass scale and resolution. While it is not possible to measure the tagger efficiencies directly in data due to the lack of a pure sample of boosted, hadronically decaying Z bosons, modelling of the likelihood function using hadronically decaying W bosons has been studied in the data. Overall, the simulation agrees well with the 20.3 fb \u22121 of \u221a s = 8 TeV pp data collected at the LHC. ation of the LHC, as well as the support staff from our institutions without whom ATLAS could not be operated efficiently.

The boson-type tagger presented here uses multiple bins of the MV1 distribution simultaneously. Five bins of MV1 are defined by b-tag efficiencies (probability to tag a b-quark jet as such) of 0-50, 50-60, 60-70, 70-80, and 80-100 % as determined in simulated tt events. A lower btag efficiency leads to higher light-quark jet rejection. The five b-tagging efficiency bins are exclusive and MV1 is constructed as a likelihood with values mostly between zero and one (one means more like a b-jet). For example, a 100 % btagging efficiency corresponds to a threshold of MV1 > 0 and an 80 % b-tagging efficiency corresponds to a threshold value of MV1 > z for z 1. The 80-100 % b-tag efficiency bin then corresponds to jets with an MV1 value between 0 and z. Constructed in this way, the fraction of true b-jets inside an efficiency bin x %-y % should be (y \u2212 x) %.",
