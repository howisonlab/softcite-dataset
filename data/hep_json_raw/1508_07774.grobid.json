The charged Higgs boson is searched for in top quark decays for m H \u00b1 < m t \u2212 m b , and in the direct production pp \u2192 t(b)H \u00b1 for m H \u00b1 > m t \u2212 m b . The H \u00b1 \u2192 \u03c4 \u00b1 \u03bd \u03c4 and H \u00b1 \u2192 tb decay modes in the final states \u03c4 h +jets, \u00b5\u03c4 h , +jets, and ' ( =e, \u00b5) are considered in the search. No signal is observed and 95% confidence level upper limits are set on the charged Higgs boson production. A modelindependent upper limit on the product branching fraction B(t \u2192 H \u00b1 b) B(H \u00b1 \u2192 \u03c4 \u00b1 \u03bd \u03c4 ) = 1.2-0.15% is obtained in the mass range m H \u00b1 = 80-160 GeV, while the upper limit on the cross section times branching fraction \u03c3(pp \u2192 t(b)H \u00b1 ) B(H \u00b1 \u2192 \u03c4 \u00b1 \u03bd \u03c4 ) = 0.38-0.025 pb is set in the mass range m H + = 180-600 GeV. Here, \u03c3(pp \u2192 t(b)H \u00b1 ) stands for the cross section sum \u03c3(pp \u2192 t(b)H + ) + \u03c3(pp \u2192 t(b)H \u2212 ). Assuming B(H \u00b1 \u2192 tb) = 1, an upper limit on \u03c3(pp \u2192 t(b)H \u00b1 ) of 2.0-0.13 pb is set for m H \u00b1 = 180-600 GeV. The combination of all considered decay modes and final states is used to set exclusion limits in the m H \u00b1 -tan \u03b2 parameter space in different MSSM benchmark scenarios.",

The discovery of another scalar boson, neutral or charged, would represent unambiguous evidence for the presence of physics beyond the SM.",

            "text": "Charged Higgs bosons are predicted in models including at least two Higgs doublets. The simplest of such models are the two-Higgs-doublet models (2HDM) [10]. Two Higgs doublets result in five physical Higgs bosons: light and heavy CP-even Higgs bosons h and H, a CP-odd Higgs boson A, plus two charged Higgs bosons H \u00b1 . Throughout this paper, charge conjugate states are implied, the cross section \u03c3(pp \u2192 t(b)H + ) denotes the sum \u03c3(pp \u2192 t(b)H + ) + \u03c3(pp \u2192 t(b)H \u2212 ), and the branching fractions B(H + \u2192 X) stand for B(H \u00b1 \u2192 X). The minimal supersymmetric SM (MSSM) [11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18] used as a benchmark in this paper is a special case of a Type-II 2HDM scenario. In such a scenario, the couplings of the charged Higgs boson to up-type quarks is proportional to cot \u03b2 while the charged Higgs boson couplings to the down-type quarks and charged leptons are proportional to tan \u03b2, where tan \u03b2 is defined as the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two Higgs boson doublet fields.",

Within the superconducting solenoid volume are a silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL), and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter (HCAL), each composed of a barrel and two endcap sections. Muons are measured in gas-ionization detectors embedded in the steel flux-return yoke outside the solenoid. Forward calorimeters extend the pseudorapidity coverage provided by the barrel and endcap detectors up to |\u03b7| < 5. The first level (L1) of the CMS trigger system, composed of custom hardware processors, uses information from the calorimeters and muon detectors to select the most interesting events in a fixed time interval of less than 4 \u00b5s. The high-level trigger processor farm further decreases the event rate from around 100 kHz to around 1 kHz, before data storage. A more detailed description of the CMS detector, together with a definition of the coordinate system used and the relevant kinematic variables, can be found in ref. [34].",

Its magnitude is referred to as E miss T . The E miss T reconstruction is improved by propagating the jet energy corrections to it. Further filter algorithms are used to reject events with anomalously large E miss T resulting from instrumental effects [46]. The \"hadron-plus-strips\" algorithm [47] is used to reconstruct hadronically decaying \u03c4 leptons. The algorithm uses the constituents of the reconstructed jets to identify individual \u03c4 decay modes with one charged and up to two neutral pions, or three charged pions. The neutral pions are reconstructed by clustering the reconstructed photons in narrow strips along the azimuthal angle direction taking into account possible broadening of calorimeter depositions from photon conversions. The \u03c4 h candidates compatible with electrons or muons are rejected. Jets originating from the hadronization of quarks and gluons are suppressed by requiring that the \u03c4 h candidate is isolated as described below. The \u03c4 h identification efficiency depends on p \u03c4 h T and \u03b7 \u03c4 h , and is on average 50% for p \u03c4 h T > 20 GeV with a probability of approximately 1% for hadronic jets to be misidentified as a \u03c4 h .",

An estimate of the multijet background is obtained by measuring the probability of the \u03c4 h candidate to pass the nominal and inverted \u03c4 h isolation criterion. The misidentification rate is measured in bins of \u03c4 h transverse momentum, in an event sample that is obtained prior to applying the b tagging, E miss T , and R min bb parts of the event selection described in section 5.1. The event sample that passes the nominal \u03c4 h isolation selection contains a nonnegligible contamination from EW+tt backgrounds with genuine and misidentified \u03c4 leptons. Therefore, the number of multijet and EW+tt events is determined by a maximum likelihood fit of the E miss T distribution. A fit is performed for each p \u03c4 h T bin. For multijet events, the E miss T templates are obtained from the data sample with inverted \u03c4 h isolation by subtracting a small contribution of simulated EW+tt events. The E miss T templates for the EW+tt events are taken from simulation in the nominal region. The misidentification rate probabilities w j are defined as the ratio of the number of multijet events in the isolated sample and the inverted isolation sample. Their measured values vary between 0.050-0.061 depending on the p \u03c4 h T bin with a statistical uncertainty smaller than 3%. The measured \u03c4 h misidentification rate probabilities are then applied as weights to multijet events passing all nominal event selection criteria, except that the isolation criterion applied on the \u03c4 h is inverted. The number of multijet events is obtained by subtracting the number of simulated EW+tt events from data.

This background is estimated by weighting each event in JHEP11(2015)018 a \u00b5+ \u2265 3 jets control sample by the probability for any jet in the event to mimic a \u03c4 h . The contribution from tt \u2192 \u00b5 + X events, where one jet fakes a \u03c4 h , is estimated using simulation and is subtracted from the data driven estimate to avoid double counting. The probability that a jet is misidentified as a \u03c4 h is measured from data as a function of jet p T , \u03b7, and jet radius using W+jets and multijet events [47,79]. Here, the estimate of the misidentified \u03c4 h background is improved with respect to the method used in ref. [25] by weighting according to the quark and gluon jet compositions (from simulation) the estimates obtained in the W+jet and multijet samples [79]. This data driven estimate is different from the one described in section 5.2.2, where the control region is obtained by inverting isolation requirements on the reconstructed \u03c4 h and only one control region is used. Here, estimating the fake rate in multijet events is not enough: the contamination from W+jets and tt \u2192 W + W \u2212 bb \u2192 \u00b5\u03bdqq bb events must be taken into account as well. The improvement in the central value of the estimate is verified with a closure test consisting in applying the data driven method to simulated events: the result of the closure test is compatible with the yields obtained from simulation, within the uncertainties. The systematic uncertainty associated to the data driven method is reduced by 30% with respect to the cited paper. The misidentified \u03c4 h background measured from data is consistent with the expectations from simulation.",

These MSSM benchmark scenarios -31 -  are compatible with the properties of the recently discovered neutral scalar boson and with the current bounds on supersymmetric particle masses, and they are specified using low-energy MSSM parameters, i.e. no particular soft SUSY-breaking scenario is assumed. The updated m max h scenario and m mod h scenarios allow the discovered scalar boson to be interpreted as the light CP-even Higgs boson in large parts of the m H + -tan \u03b2 plane. The light stop scenario leads to a suppressed rate for the Higgs boson production by gluon fusion, and the light stau scenario enhances the decay rate of the light CP-even Higgs boson to photons. A tau-phobic scenario has suppressed couplings to down-type fermions. In the low-M H scenario, the discovered scalar boson is assumed to be the heavy CP-even Higgs boson and m A is fixed to be 110 GeV causing m H + to be 132 GeV. For m H + = 200-600 GeV, a combination of all decay modes and final states is used to set the limits. In this combination, the signal yields from the H + \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03bd \u03c4 and H + \u2192 tb decay modes are defined by the branching fractions predicted by the model. If the limit on the charged Higgs boson production for a given m H + -tan \u03b2 point is smaller than the cross section predicted by the model [28][29][30][31] In figures 11-12, theoretical systematic uncertainties affecting the expected signal event yields are added to the limit computation, modelled as nuisance parameters, in addition to the uncertainties discussed in section 9. The uncertainty in the branching fractions of the charged Higgs boson is estimated from the decay width uncertainties as in ref. [94] by scaling each partial width separately while fixing all others to their central values. This results in individual theoretical uncertainties for each branching fraction. The width uncertainties comprise the uncertainty from missing higher order corrections to beyond LO EW diagrams (5%), missing higher order corrections to NLO QCD (2%), and \u2206 b -correction uncertainties (3%) [95]. The \u2206 b -correction arises from the presence of squarks and gluino contributions in the charged Higgs boson Yukawa coupling to top and bottom quarks [96,97].",

For m H + = 90-160 GeV, the analysis of the H + \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03bd \u03c4 decay mode with the \u03c4 h +jets final state described in section 5 is taken as input. The mass range starts here from m H + = 90 GeV, as the lower values of a charged Higgs boson mass are not accessible in the considered MSSM scenarios. For m H + = 200-600 GeV, a combination of all decay modes and final states is used to set the limits. In this combination, the signal yields from the H + \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03bd \u03c4 and H + \u2192 tb decay modes are defined by the branching fractions predicted by the model. If the limit on the charged Higgs boson production for a given m H + -tan \u03b2 point is smaller than the cross section predicted by the model[28][29][30][31], the point is excluded. The mass range is chosen to start from m H + = 200 GeV to avoid the interference region where a charged Higgs boson is produced both from off-shell top quark decays and through direct production. In all these scenarios except for the low-M H and light stop scenarios, a lower bound of about 155 GeV on the charged Higgs boson mass has been set assuming m h = 125 \u00b1 3 GeV. The light stop scenario is excluded for m H + < 160 GeV assuming m h = 125 \u00b1 3 GeV. For m H + > m t \u2212 m b , the H + \u2192 tb decay mode searches yield a lower limit on tan \u03b2 while the upper limit on tan \u03b2 is dominated by the results from the analysis of the H + \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03bd \u03c4 decay mode with the \u03c4 h +jets final state. The low-M H scenario is completely excluded (figure 12) assuming the heavy CP-even MSSM Higgs boson mass is m H = 125 \u00b1 3 GeV.In figures 11-12, theoretical systematic uncertainties affecting the expected signal event yields are added to the limit computation, modelled as nuisance parameters, in addition to the uncertainties discussed in section 9. The uncertainty in the branching fractions of the charged Higgs boson is estimated from the decay width uncertainties as in ref.[94] by scaling each partial width separately while fixing all others to their central values. This results in individual theoretical uncertainties for each branching fraction. The width uncertainties comprise the uncertainty from missing higher order corrections to beyond LO EW diagrams (5%), missing higher order corrections to NLO QCD (2%), and \u2206 b -correction uncertainties (3%)[95]. The \u2206 b -correction arises from the presence of squarks and gluino contributions in the charged Higgs boson Yukawa coupling to top and bottom quarks[96,97].For m H + = 90-160 GeV, the theoretical uncertainties in the signal yield include the uncertainties in the branching fractions for t \u2192 H + b and H + \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03bd \u03c4 totalling 0.1-5.0% depending on m H + and tan \u03b2. Additionally, an uncertainty of 3% is added to the simulated tt background to take into account higher order corrections to the tt cross section. For m H + = 200-600 GeV, the charged Higgs boson production cross section uncertainty and the uncertainty in the branching ratios are considered. The cross section uncertainty varies between 22-32% depending on m H + , tan \u03b2, and the MSSM benchmark scenario. The uncertainty in B(H + \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03bd \u03c4 ) varies between 0.4-5.0% for tan \u03b2 = 10-60 depending on m H + and the MSSM benchmark scenario. The B(H + \u2192 tb) uncertainty varies between 0.1-5.0% for tan \u03b2 = 1-10 depending on m H + and the MSSM benchmark scenario. The theoretical branching fraction uncertainties for a given m H + -tan \u03b2 point are summed linearly according to the LHC Higgs cross section working group prescription[94,95], but the cross section and branching fraction uncertainties are treated as independent nuisances. The expected limit improves by no more than 2% if the theoretical uncertainties are treated in the statistical model as independent sources.",
