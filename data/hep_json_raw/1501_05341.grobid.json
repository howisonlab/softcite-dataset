            "text": "In the low invariant mass region, M ll < 1.1 GeV/c 2 (LMR), the dilepton production is dominated by inmedium decay of vector mesons (\u03c1, \u03c9 and \u03c6) in the hadronic gas phase. In-medium modifications to the mass and width of the vector mesons are considered a link to chiral symmetry restoration [3,4]. In the vacuum, chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken, which results in mass differences between chiral partners [e.g. \u03c1 and a 1 (1260)]. In the hot, dense medium, chiral symmetry is expected to restore and the mass distributions of \u03c1 and a 1 (1260) are expected to change and degenerate. Since it is extremely challenging to measure a spectral function for the a 1 (1260) meson, one cannot directly observe the disappearance of the mass splitting between the \u03c1 and a 1 (1260) experimentally. Instead, efforts are devoted to studying the modification of vector meson spectral function. Two schematic scenarios are used to describe the in-medium \u03c1 spectrum function: a broadened and a dropping-mass \u03c1. The broadened \u03c1 scenario incorporates finite temperature effects into selfenergy corrections through medium interactions and \u03c0\u03c0 annihilations [5]. The dropping mass scenario uses the quark mean field from a high temperature/density regime wherein constituent quarks are the relevant degrees of freedom, and then extrapolates down to a low temperature/density regime wherein hadrons are appropriate degrees of freedom [6].",

More recently, NA60 published a precise measurement of the dimuon invariant mass spectra in In+In collisions at \u221a s NN = 17.3 GeV [8]. The results show a significant excess in the LMR above the hadronic sources. In both cases, the excess is consistent with a broadened \u03c1 spectral function [5], but not with a \u03c1 dropping-mass scenario [6], where both models have been evaluated for the same fireball evolution. In the model calculation, the coupling to the baryons in the medium plays a dominant role in the broadening of the \u03c1 spectral function [5,7,8].",

The absolute distance between collision vertices and the TPC center along the beam direction was required to be less than 70 cm. The transverse momentum resolution is measured to be \u0394p",

            "text": "The e + e \u2212 mass distribution from open heavy-flavor sources is generated using PYTHIA 6.416 [31]. Previous charm cross section measurements from the SPS, FNAL, STAR and PHENIX experiments [33] are well described by the upper limit of a Fixed-Order Next-to-Leading Logarithm (FONLL) calculation [34]. Therefore we obtain the charm total cross section in p + p at \u221a s = 19.6 GeV by scaling the FONLL upper limit to the previous measurements using the minimum \u03c7 2 method. This total cross section 8.2 \u00b1 0.5 \u03bcb is used to normalize the dielectron yield from the PYTHIA simulation, which is additionally scaled by the number of binary collisions for Au+Au at \u221a s NN = 19.6 GeV to be compared with the data. For the efficiency-corrected dielectron invariant mass distribution, the systematic errors are dominated by uncertainties on the TPC tracking efficiency (14% in the dielectron yields), the TOF matching efficiency (10% in the dielectron yields), hadron contamination (0-20%), and electron identification (2%). The total systematic uncertainty on the pair reconstruction efficiency is estimated to be 18%. The systematic uncertainties on the likesign background subtraction were mainly from the uncertainties on the acceptance difference factors between the unlike-sign and like-sign pairs. The acceptance difference factors were derived using mixed-event technique. In the mixed-event technique, tracks from different events were used to form unlike-sign or like-sign pairs. The events were divided into different categories according to the collision vertex, event plane, azimuthal angle, and centrality. The bin sizes of collision vertex, event plane, azimuthal angle, and centrality were chosen to be small enough and the two events to be mixed must come from the same event category to ensure similar detector geometric acceptance, azimuthal anisotropy, and track multiplicities. The uncertainties in the acceptance difference factors were found to be 0.003% and result in 1% uncertainties for the dielectron signals. For the cocktail simulation, the systematic uncertainties come from the uncertainties of particle yields, decay branching ratios and form factors. Table II lists all the contributions to the systematic uncertainties on the dielectron mass spectrum and cocktail simulation within the STAR acceptance at \u221a s NN = 19.6 GeV. After efficiency correction, the dielectron excess mass spectrum is corrected for the detector acceptance. The acceptance correction is estimated by a Monte Carlo simulation with inputs of virtual photon yield spectra, phase space distributions and decay kinematics. The method is similar to the approach used by NA60 [35], in which one assumes that the excess yields are from medium emission. The acceptance is calculated by the yield ratio of reconstructed dielectrons in the STAR detector to the input dielectrons. Figure 3 shows the two-dimensional acceptance of the virtual photons with a Gaussian-like rapidity distribution in Au+Au at \u221a s NN = 19.6 GeV at STAR. The \u03c3 value of the distribution is 1.5 [35]  [36]. For the charm correlation contribution, we studied the following cases: a) keep the direct PYTHIA correlation between c andc which was used in our default cocktail calculations; b) break the azimuthal angular correlation between charm decayed electrons completely but keep the p T , \u03b7, and \u03c6 distributions from PYTHIA; c) randomly sample two electrons with the single electron p T , \u03b7, and \u03c6 distributions from PYTHIA; and d) based on c), but sample the p T of each electron according to the modified p T distribution from the measurements of non-photonic electron nuclear modification factors in Au+Au collisions. The maximal difference between case a) and the other three is taken as the systematic uncertainties on the charm correlation contribution. The uncertainty from acceptance correction contains uncertainties from the rapidity distribution and input dielectron sources. A uniform rapidity distribution is compared with the Gaussian-like case, and the resulting uncertainty is 2% in the LMR in Au+Au at \u221a s NN = 19.6",

            "text": "The dielectron invariant mass distribution after efficiency correction is shown in the upper panel of Fig. 4 for Au+Au collisions at \u221a s NN = 19.6 GeV. It is compared with a hadronic cocktail simulation, which consists of all the dielectron hadronic sources except the \u03c1 0 . An enhancement of the dielectron yield is observed in the mass region M ee < 1 GeV/c 2 . A model calculation with a broadened \u03c1 spectral function [12] is added to the hadronic cocktail and compared with the data, as shown in the bottom panel of Fig. 4. The dielectron yields in the model calculation were filtered by the STAR acceptance (p e T > 0.2 GeV/c and |\u03b7 e | < 1). The model calculation involves a realistic space-time evolution, and includes contributions from quark-gluon-plasma (QGP), 4pion annihilation and in-medium vector meson contributions. The initial temperature from the model is 224 MeV and the starting time \u03c4 0 is 0.8 fm/c [32]. The comparison of the model with data shows that a broadened \u03c1-spectra scenario is consistent with the STAR data within uncertainties. The same conclusion has been drawn in Au+Au collisions at \u221a s NN = 200 GeV [10]. Using the broadened \u03c1 spectral function, QCD and Weinberg sum rules, and inputs from Lattice QCD, theorists have demonstrated that when the temperature reaches 170 MeV, the derived a 1 (1260) spectral function is the same as the in-medium \u03c1 spectral function, a signature of chiral symmetry restoration [37]. GeV are from Refs. [38] and [39], respectively. Comparison to the NA60 data [8,40]  To quantify the yield, the known hadronic cocktail,   GeV is consistent within the uncertainties while the excess at \u221a s NN = 200 GeV is higher in central collisions, but within 2\u03c3 uncertainty. This might indicate that the lifetime of the medium created in central collisions at \u221a s NN = 200 GeV is longer than those in peripheral collisions and at \u221a s NN = 17.3 GeV, which enhances the dilepton production from thermal radiation. The same model calculations [11,32] that consistently describe the dilepton excesses in the \u221a s NN = 17.3, 19.6, and 200 GeV A+A data give lifetimes of 6.8 \u00b1 1.0 fm/c, 7.7 \u00b1 1.5 fm/c, and 10.5 \u00b1 2.1 fm/c for the 17.3 GeV In+In, 19.6 GeV Au+Au, and 200 GeV Au+Au data as shown in Fig. 6  [19]. In addition, the lifetime has a strong centrality dependence in \u221a s NN = 200 GeV Au+Au collisions in the calculations, as indicated by the dashed curve in Fig. 6. With the total baryon density nearly a constant and the dilepton emission rate dominant in the critical temperature region at \u221a s NN = 17.3-200 GeV, the normalized excess dilepton yields in the low mass region from the measurements are proportional to the calculated lifetimes of the medium [19]. We note that the lifetime might be model dependent. It is important to have the calculated lifetimes from other models to verify this proportionality.",
