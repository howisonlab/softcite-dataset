            "text": "Measuring strange particle production in proton-proton (pp) collisions is a necessary benchmark for the physics of ultra relativistic heavy ions. This is important at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), where the heavy-ion programme is scheduled to begin in November 2010 [1]. Moreover, strangeness in pp collisions is interesting in itself, as it may shed light on hadron production mechanisms. While the hard component of the event may be described by the perturbative Quantum Chromo-Dynamics (based on parton-parton scattering and fragmentation [2,3]), the soft component must be treated in a more complex manner. Currently, the soft physics is described via thermal models [4,5] or via QCD-inspired models (relying on multi-parton processes [6] or multiple scattering [7,8], for instance). In either case, further improvements of such phenomenological approaches may be spurred by confrontation with experimental measurements.",

These include both pp collisions (SppS, Tevatron) and pp collisions (RHIC), with centre of mass energies \u221a s ranging from 0.2 TeV up to 1.96 TeV [9][10][11]. The LHC, in operation since November 2009, can extend the existent 0.9-TeV measurements made by the UA5 collaborations in pp, and perform new measurements at \u221a s = 7 TeV, beyond the Tevatron energies. The ALICE experiment [1] is well-suited for such spectrum measurements, due to a low p T cut-off and excellent particle identification (PID) capabilities. The low p T cut-off is made possible by the low magnetic field applied in the central barrel (\u2264 0.5 T ) and the low material budget in this mid-rapidity region (13% of radiation length [12]). The PID capabilities are supplied by a set of detectors utilizing diverse techniques (energy loss, time of flight, transition radiation, Cerenkov effect).",

The \u039b reconstruction is grounded in the secondary vertex finding, a V0 structure built out of two secondary tracks of opposite charges, compatible with coming from the same vertex. It is checked that the V0 candidate thus obtained sits in the proper invariant mass window to validate the \u039b hypothesis. The \u039b candidate is then matched with a secondary track, to form a typical cascade structure. The reconstructed momentum of the multi-strange baryon must point in the direction of the primary vertex. The V0 vertex and the V0-bachelor matching are limited to a certain fiducial volume. A PID compatibility cut, based on the dE/dx measurement from the TPC, is required for each of the three decay products, known as daughter particles, to partially remove some combinatorial background.",
