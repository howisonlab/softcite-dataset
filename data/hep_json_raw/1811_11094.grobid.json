In the four-lepton invariant-mass range of 80 < m4^ < 1000 GeV, an artificial neural network is used to enhance the separation between single-and double-parton scattering based on the kinematics of the four leptons in the final state. An upper limit on the fraction of events originating from double-parton scattering is determined at 95% confidence level to be f DPS = 0.042,",

As first pointed out by Sj\u00f6strand and van Zijl [1], one source of the underlying-event activity, particularly in the highenergy regime of the LHC, is multi-parton interactions (MPI): in teractions of pairs of partons from the interacting protons which occur simultaneously with the hard process. In high-energy pp in teractions, where the density of low-x partons is high, there is enough energy to produce hard multi-parton interactions. The sim plest example is hard double-parton scattering (DPS), where two partons from each proton interact with each other leading to per turbative final states.",

Firstly, the probabil ity of occurrence of DPS and the potential correlations between the products of these two perturbative interactions provide valu able information about the dynamics of the partonic structure of the proton (see Ref. [2] and references therein). Secondly, DPS pro cesses may also constitute a background to reactions proceeding through single-parton scattering (SPS). An example is the produc tion of four charged leptons in the final state, addressed in this Letter. This reaction is dominated by the SPS production of two Z ( * ) bosons, followed by subsequent leptonic decays. The Z ( * ) no-E-mail address: atlas. publications @cern. ch. tation indicates the production of on-or off-shell Z bosons ( Z and Z * ), or the production of off-shell photons (\u03b3 * ). However, the four leptons could also be produced as the result of two Drell-Yan processes occurring simultaneously, potentially distorting the mea surements of prompt-lepton production.",

Each dilepton event was required to have two se lected leptons forming an SFOC pair with transverse momenta pT1,^2 > 20, 15 GeV to account for the trigger conditions under which the dilepton data were collected. The same single-lepton, double-electron and double-muon triggers were used as in the se lection of the four-lepton sample. An event was rejected if there was a third lepton with pT > 7GeV(6GeVfor muons). The pairs of events were chosen randomly and overlaid by adding the lepton four-vectors of one event to the other. The distance between the primary vertices along the z-axis for the two events was required to be smaller than 1cm. After the overlay, the same four-lepton selection was applied as described in Section 4, but the trigger configuration of the available dilepton datasets required an in crease in the lepton p T thresholds. They were chosen to be 20, 20, 15, and 15 GeV for leptons ordered in descending order of pT . To have a valid comparison within the same phase space between the overlaid dileptons and the Pythia 8 sample, the same selection on lepton pT was also applied to the latter. The distributions of discriminating variables were compared, as were the distributions of \u03beDPS, obtained with the ANN trained on Pythia 8.

Leptons with transverse momentum above 20, 15, 10 (8 if muon), and 7 (6 if muon) GeV, sorted in de scending order of pT , are selected in the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 2.5in the case of electrons and |\u03b7| < 2.7in the case of muons. The four leptons form two same-flavour opposite-charge lepton pairs. The dilepton invariant masses are required to be in the range 50 < mleading < 120 GeV for the leading pair and 12 < m sub-leading < 120 GeV for the sub-leading pair, where the leading pair is defined as the pair with invariant mass closer to the Z boson mass. The transverse momentum pT+ ^-of the dilep tons is required to be above 2GeV. The events in the four-lepton invariant-mass range of 80 < m4^ < 1000 GeV are considered. An artificial neural network is used to discriminate between singleand double-parton scattering events. No signal of double-parton scattering is observed and an upper limit on the fraction of the DPS contribution to the inclusive four-lepton final state of 0.042 is obtained at 95% CL. This upper limit translates, for two indepen dent subscatterings, into a lower limit of 1.0mbon the effective cross section, consistent with previously measured values in differ ent processes and at different centre-of-mass energies.",
