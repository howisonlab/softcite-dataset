However, the CDM composition is beyond the standard model of particle physics, and thus is still unknown to date. One of the most compelling candidates for CDM is the axion [2], provided its mass is above 1 \u00b5eV [3] and below 3 meV [4]. The axion is the result of the breakdown of a new symmetry proposed by Peccei and Quinn [5] to solve the strong CP (Charge-conjugation and P arity) problem in Quantum Chromodynamics [6]. As a result of the axion production mechanism, the axion mass range is very large with the above range being optimum for CDM.",

            "text": "The ACTION experiment considered in this paper constitutes a tunable copper toroidal cavity, toroidal coils which provide a static magnetic field, and a typical heterodyne receiver chain. The experiment was conducted at room temperature. The system is called the \"simplified ACTION\". A torus is defined by x = (R + r cos \u03b8) cos \u03c6, y = (R + r cos \u03b8) sin \u03c6, and z = r sin \u03b8, where \u03c6 and \u03b8 are angles that make a full circle of radius R and r, respectively. As shown in Fig. 1, R is the distance from the center of the torus to the center of the tube and r is the radius of the tube. Our cavity tube's R and r are 4 and 2 cm, respectively, and the cavity thickness is 1 cm. The frequency tuning system constitutes a copper tuning hoop whose R and r are 4 and 0.2 cm, respectively, and three brass posts for linking between the hoop and a piezo linear actuator that controls the movement of our frequency tuning system. The quasi-TM 010 (QTM 1 ) modes of the cavity are tuned by moving up and down our frequency tuning system along the axis parallel to the brass posts. Two magnetic loop couplings were employed, one for weakly coupled magnetic loop coupling and the other for critically coupled magnetic loop coupling, i.e. \u03b2 \u2243 1 to maximize the signal power expressed in Eq. (1). The Q L values of the QTM 1 modes with \u03b2 \u2243 1 vary from \u223c10,000 at the \u03bd of 6 GHz to \u223c5,000 at that of 7 GHz [18], where the former and the latter correspond to about 95% and 67% of the designed values. Without the frequency tuning system, the Q L of our toroidal cavity is almost 100% of the designed Q L , which is attributed to the absence of the cavity endcaps in toroidal geometry. The rather lower Q L than that of the designed Q L could be improved by optimizing the magnetic loop coupling positions. We could not measure the Q L of the QTM 1 confidently for the \u03bd from 6.77 to 6.80 GHz due to mode-crossings at the \u03bd of about 6.78 GHz. Based on the Q L values of the QTM 1 modes, the discrete frequency step was chosen to be a half of the smallest cavity linewidth, i.e., 300 kHz. A static magnetic field was provided by a 1.6 mm diameter copper wire ramped up to 20 A with three winding turns, as shown in Fig. 1. Figure 2 shows good agreement between measurement with a Hall probe and a simulation [19] of the magnetic field induced by the coils. The B avg from the magnetic field map provided by the simulation turns out to be 32 G. No fringe magnetic fields are outside of an ideal toroidal magnet, and as shown in Fig. 2, the magnetic field outside of our toroidal magnet system also drops drastically, as expected. Therefore, the handling of quantum-noise-limited superconducting amplifiers that work in an almost zero field environment is much easier with toroidal geometry.",

As shown in Fig. 3, we found no significant drop-off in the form factors of the QTM 1 modes, which is attributed to the absence of the cavity endcaps in toroidal geometry. A drop-off in the form factor happens when hybrid modes occur due to the capacitive effect caused by the gaps between the tuning rod and the cavity endcaps in cylindrical geometry, which was confirmed by simulation [19]. While we cannot avoid such gaps in cylindrical geometry, no such gaps exist in toroidal geometry in the absence of the cavity endcaps, as shown in Fig. 1. This lack of the form factor drop-off is one of the significant advantages in toroidal geometry. Note that the QTM 1 mode can be identified in a simulation regardless of mode-crossings; thus, the associated form factor can be obtained regardless of mode-crossings, as shown in Fig. 3. On the other hand, experiments with minimal coupling to the crossed mode cannot distinguish the QTM 1 mode from the crossed mode; hence, the associated form factor is not very meaningful experimentally in that case. In toroidal geometry, the situation is even more favorable, with the competing mode appearing only very weakly due to the azimuthal degeneracy of the quasi-TE modes. Experimentally, we found out that the only interference with the QTM 1 mode is located at the frequency gap between 6.77 and 6.80 GHz, as mentioned earlier (see also Fig. 4).",

With an IF (Intermediate Frequency) of 38 MHz, we take power spectra over a bandwidth of 3 MHz, which allows 10 power spectra to overlap in most of the cavity resonant frequencies with a discrete frequency step of 300 kHz. Power spectra are divided by the noise power estimated from the measured and calibrated system noise temperatures. The five-parameter fit also developed in Ref. [14] is then employed to eliminate the residual structure of the power spectrum. The background-subtracted power spectra are combined in order to further reduce the power fluctuation. We found no significant excess from the combined power spectrum and thus set exclusion limits of g a\u03b3\u03b3 for 24.7 < m a < 29.1 \u00b5eV. No frequency bins in the combined power spectrum exceeded a threshold of 5.5\u03c3 Pn , where \u03c3 Pn is the rms of the noise power P n . We found \u03c3 Pn was underestimated due to the five-parameter fit as reported in Ref. [16] and thus corrected for it accordingly before applying the threshold of 5.5\u03c3 Pn . Our SNR in each frequency bin in the combined power spectrum was also combined with weighting according to the Lorentzian lineshape, depending on the Q L at each resonant frequency of the cavity. With the tail of the assumed Maxwellian axion signal shape, the best SNR is achieved by taking about 80% of the signal and associate noise power; however, doing so inevitably degrades SNR in Eq. (2) by about 20%. Because the axion mass is unknown, we are also unable to locate the axion signal in the right frequency bin, or equivalently, the axion signal can be split into two adjacent frequency bins.

Figure 4 shows the excluded parameter space at a 95% confidence level (C.L.) by the simplified ACTION experiment. We demonstrate an axion haloscope with toroidal geometry in this paper and our result supersedes the pre-existing exclusion limits reported by ALPS [21] in the relevant mass ranges. The prospects for axion dark matter searches with two larger-scale toroidal geometries that could be sensitive to the KSVZ and DFSZ models are now discussed. A similar discussion can be found elsewhere [23]. One is called the \"large ACTION\", and the other is the \"small ACTION\", where the cavity volume of the former is about 9,870 L and that of the latter is about 80 L. The B avg targets for the large and small ACTION experiments are 5 and 12 T, respectively, where the peak fields of the former and latter would be about 9 and 17 T. Hence, the large and small toroidal magnets can be realized by employing NbTi and Nb 3 Sn superconducting wires, respectively.

With an alumina tuning hoop whose relative permittivity is 9.9 and QTM 1 modes, the large ACTION could search for axion dark matter down to 0.79 \u00b5eV, and could search up to 2.73 \u00b5eV with a copper tuning hoop and quasi-TM 020 (QTM 2 ) modes; hence, the large ACTION could search for the axion mass range from 0.79 to 2.73 \u00b5eV with several configurations of tuning hoops and search modes. With the same approach employed for the large ACTION, the feasible search range of the small ACTION is also estimated. The search range that would be very difficult to investigate in the large and small ACTION experiments with a single-cavity could be scanned by adopting a multiple-cavity [24], in this case, by using the 4-cavity together with the large toroidal magnet. The Q L values with \u03b2 = 2 [25] were estimated with pure copper and loss free alumina at cryogenic temperatures, but they were limited by the anomalous skin effect. Thanks to the very large volume of the cavity in the large ACTION experiment, we could realize a scanning rate (d\u03bd/dt) that achieved DFSZ sensitivity over a relevant search range after about 1 year of scanning with state-of-the-art commercial transistor-based amplifiers as the 1st amplifiers whose noise temperatures are about 1 K [26] and the physical temperature of the cavity T p,cavity of 4.2 K. This temperature is, thus, equivalent to T n,cavity \u223c 3.7 K [27] which can be achieved easily with liquid helium. On top of a T p,cavity of 0.1 K, quantum-noise-limited superconducting amplifiers were employed as the 1st amplifiers whose noise temperatures are proportional to not only the frequencies (T n,amp \u223c h\u03bd/k B ln 2) [28] but also the ambient temperatures (T p,cavity in axion haloscopes) to achieve fast DFSZ scanning rates from the small AC-TION experiment.

This is the first axion haloscope search utilizing toroidal geometry since the advent of the axion haloscope search by Sikivie. We have also discussed the prospects for axion dark matter searches with two larger-scale toroidal geometries, the large ACTION and small ACTION, that could be sensitive to cosmologically relevant couplings over the axion mass range from 0.79 to 15.05 \u00b5eV with several configurations of tuning hoops, search modes, and multiple-cavity system.",
