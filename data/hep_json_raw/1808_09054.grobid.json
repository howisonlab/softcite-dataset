Higgs boson couplings have been studied in this channel with Run-1 data by the ATLAS [1] and CMS [2] experiments and recently with Run-2 data by the CMS experiment [3]. The H \u2192 WW * decay channel has the second-largest branching fraction and allowed the most precise Higgs boson cross-section measurements in Run-1 [4]. The measured cross-section of the ggF production process probes the Higgs boson couplings to gluons and heavy quarks, while the VBF process directly probes the couplings to W and Z bosons. The leading-order diagrams for the ggF and VBF production processes are depicted in Fig. 1.",

The x-axis points from the IP to the centre of the LHC ring, and the y -axis points upward. Cylindrical coordinates (r, \u03c6) are used in the transverse plane, \u03c6 being the azimuthal angle around the z -axis.

The inner tracking detector (ID) is located in a 2T magnetic field and is designed to measure charged-particle trajectories up to a pseudorapidity of |\u03b7| = 2.5. Surrounding the ID are electromag netic and hadronic calorimeters, which use liquid argon (LAr) and lead absorber for the electromagnetic central and endcap calorime ters (|\u03b7| < 3.2), copper absorber for the hadronic endcap calorime ter (1.5 < |\u03b7| < 3 . 2), and scintillator-tile active material with steel absorber for the central (|\u03b7| < 1.7) hadronic calorimeter. The solid angle coverage is extended to |\u03b7| = 4.9 with forward copper/LAr and tungsten/LAr calorimeter modules. The muon spectrometer comprises separate trigger chambers within the range |\u03b7| < 2.4 and high-precision tracking chambers within the range |\u03b7| < 2.7, measuring the deflection of muons in a magnetic field generated by the three superconducting toroidal magnets. A two-level trigger system is used to select events [7].",

Electrons are required to satisfy |\u03b7| < 2.47, excluding the transition region between the barrel and endcap calorimeters, 1.37 < |\u03b7| < 1.52. Muon candidates are selected from tracks reconstructed in the ID matched to tracks reconstructed in the muon spectrometer [64] and are required to satisfy |\u03b7| < 2.5. To reject particles misidentified as leptons, several identification requirements as well as calorimeter and track isolation criteria [64,65] are applied. The electron identification criteria applied pro vide an efficiency in the range 88-94% depending on electron p T and \u03b7 . For muons, high efficiency, close to 95%, is observed over the full instrumented \u03b7 range. The final lepton-selection criteria require two different-flavour opposite-sign leptons, the higher-pT (leading) lepton with pT > 22 GeV and the subleading lepton with p T > 15 GeV. At least one of the leptons must correspond to a lep ton that triggered the recording of the event. When the e-\u03bc trig ger is solely responsible for the recording of the event, each lepton must be matched to one of the trigger objects. The trigger match ing requires the offline pT of the matching object to be higher than the trigger level threshold by at least 1GeV. Jets are reconstructed using the anti-kt algorithm [66] with a radius parameter R = 0.4. The four-momenta of jets are corrected for the non-compensating response of calorimeter, signal losses due to noise threshold ef fects, energy lost in non-instrumented regions, and contributions from pile-up [67]. Jets are required to have p T > 20 GeV and |\u03b7| < 4.5. A multivariate selection that reduces contamination from pile-up [68] is applied to jets with pT < 60 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.4, util ising calorimeter and tracking information to separate hard-scatter jets from pile-up jets. For jets with pT < 50 GeV and |\u03b7| > 2.5, jet shapes and topological jet correlations in pile-up interactions are exploited to reduce contamination. Jets with pT > 20 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.5 containing b -hadrons (b-jets) are identified using a multi variate technique having as input the track impact parameters and information from secondary vertices. The adopted working point provides a nominal 3% light-flavour (u -, d-, s-quark and gluon) misidentification rate and a 32% c-jet misidentification rate with an average 85% b-jet tagging efficiency, as estimated from simu lated tt\u00af events [69]. Ambiguities from overlapping reconstructed jet and lepton candidates are resolved as follows. If a reconstructed muon shares an ID track with a reconstructed electron, the elec tron is removed. Reconstructed jets geometrically overlapping in a cone of radius ^ R = 0.2 with electrons or muons are also re moved. Electrons and muons, with transverse momentum pT , are removed if they are within ^R = min(0.4, 0.04 + 10 GeV/pT) of the axis of any surviving jet. The missing transverse momentum E T miss (with magnitude E T miss) is defined as the negative vector sum of the pT of all the selected leptons and jets, and including reconstructed tracks not associated with these objects, and con sistent with originating from the primary pp collision [70]. Asecond definition of missing transverse momentum (in this case de noted pT miss ) uses the tracks associated with the jets instead of the calorimeter-measured jets. It was found during the optimisation that pT miss performs better in terms of background rejection [70].",

The discriminating variable mT is used in the ggF SRs, with eight bins for the Njet = 0 and six bins for the Njet = 1 regions. The bin boundaries are chosen such that approxi mately the same number of signal events is expected in each bin. The mT distributions for the Njet=0 and Njet=1 SRs are shown in Fig. 3. All figures in this Letter, except Fig. 2, use signal and background normalisations as fitted by the final statistical analysis of all signal and control regions, including pulls of statistical and systematic uncertainty parameters (post-fit). For the Njet \u2265 2VBF selection, a boosted decision tree (BDT) [72] is used to enhance discrimination power between the VBF signal and backgrounds, including the ggF process. Kinematic variables of the two lead ing jets ( j) and the two leading leptons (^) are used as inputs to the BDT: the invariant masses (m jj, m^^), the difference be tween the two jet rapidities (^y jj), and the difference between the azimuthal angles of the two leptons (^\u03c6^^). Other variables used in the BDT training are: mT , the lepton \u03b7-centrality ( ^ C^ , where C^ =|2\u03b7^ -\u03b7j|/^\u03b7 jj), which quantifies the positions of the leptons relative to the leading jets in pseudorapidity [73], the sum of the invariant masses of all four possible lepton-jet pairs ( ^, j m^ j ), and the total transverse momentum ( pt Tot), which is de fined as the magnitude of the vectorial sum of all selected objects. The observables providing the best discrimination between signal and background are mjj and ^y jj, and are shown in Fig. 4 after applying all selections. The BDT score reflects the compatibility of an event with VBF-like kinematics. Signal-like events would tend to have high BDT score, while background-like events tend to have low BDT score. The signal purity, therefore, increases at high values of BDT score. The BDT score is used as the discriminating variable in the statistical analysis with four bins. The bin boundaries are chosen to maximise the expected sensitivity for the VBF produc tion mode, resulting in smaller bin widths for larger values of the BDT score. In the highest-score BDT bin, the expected signal-tobackground ratio of the VBF signal is approximately 0.6. The BDT distribution for the VBF-enriched region is presented in Fig. 5.",

The errors include the statistical and systematic uncertainties. ground contributions arise from W + jets and multi-jet production with misidentified leptons, which are either non-prompt leptons from decays of heavy-flavour hadrons or jets faking prompt lep tons. Dedicated regions in data, identified hereafter as control re gions (CRs), are used to normalise the predictions of some of the background processes. CRs are defined for the main background processes: WW (only for Njet \u22641 final states), tt\u00af/Wt, and Z/\u03b3 * . Table 3 summarises the event selection for all CRs. For the Njet = 0 and Njet = 1 WW CRs, m^^ selections orthogonal to those of the SRs are applied. For the tt\u00af/ Wt CRs, the b-veto is replaced with a b-tag requirement. For the Njet=1 and Njet\u22652 VBF Z/\u03b3 * CRs, the m\u03c4\u03c4 selection is inverted, while for the Njet =0 Z/\u03b3 * CR the ^\u03c6^^ selection criterion is inverted. Fig. 6 presents the post-fit mT dis tributions in the Njet=0 and Njet=1 CRs. In Fig. 7, the post-fit ^yjj distributions in the Njet\u22652 VBF CRs are shown. Data and simulation are in agreement within un certainties for all the relevant distributions in the different CRs. The background contributions with misidentified leptons are esti mated using a data-driven technique. A control sample where one of the two lepton candidates fails to meet the nominal identifica tion and isolation criteria but satisfies looser identification criteria, referred as an anti-identified lepton, is used. The contribution of this background in the SRs and CRs is then obtained by scaling the number of data events, after the subtraction of processes with two prompt leptons, in the control samples by an extrapolation factor. The latter is measured in a Z +jets-enriched data sample, where the Z boson decays to a pair of electrons or muons, and the misidentified lepton candidate recoils against the Z boson. The extrapolation factor is defined as the ratio of the numbers of iden tified and anti-identified leptons, and is measured in bins of pT and \u03b7. Furthermore, a sample composition correction factor is ap plied separately in p T < 25 GeV and p T > 25 GeV bins, and is defined in each bin as the ratio of the extrapolation factors mea sured in W +jets and Z +jets MC simulation. The total uncertainty of the background with misidentified leptons includes uncertain ties due to the difference in sample composition between the  WW(a, b), tt\u00af/Wt (c, d), and Z/\u03b3 * (e, f) processes.

Other sources of uncertainty are lepton energy (momentum) scale and resolution, identification and isola tion [63,64,76], missing transverse momentum measurement [77], modelling of pile-up, and luminosity measurement [78]. The lumi nosity uncertainty is only applied to the Higgs boson signal and to background processes that are normalised to theoretical pre dictions. For the main processes, the theoretical uncertainties are assessed by a comparison between nominal and alternative event generators and UEPS models, as indicated in Table 1. For the pre diction of WZ, ZZ, V\u03b3 * , and V\u03b3 production (VV), variations of the matching scale are considered instead of an alternative gener ator. In addition, the effects of QCD factorisation and renormalisa tion scale variations and PDF model uncertainties are evaluated.",

            "text": "The ggF and VBF cross-sections are obtained from a simulta neous statistical analysis of the data samples in all SRs and CRs by maximising a likelihood function in a fit using scaling param eters multiplying the predicted total production cross-section of each signal process and applying the profile likelihood method. The CRs are used to determine the normalisation of the corresponding backgrounds. The systematic uncertainties enter the fit as nuisance parameters in the likelihood function. Table 5 shows the post-fit yields for all of the three SRs. Yields in the highest-score VBF BDT bin are also given. The uncertainties in the total yields are smaller than those of some of the individ- Table 5 Post-fit MC and data yields in the ggF and VBF SRs. Yields in the highest-score VBF BDT bin are also presented. The quoted uncertainties include the theoretical and ex perimental systematic sources and those due to sample statistics. The sum of all the contributions may differ from the total value due to rounding. Moreover, the total uncertainty differs from the sum in quadrature of the single-process uncertainties due to the correlations. ual background processes. This effect is due to correlations among different data regions, background processes, and nuisance param eters. The correlations are imposed by the fit as it constrains the total yield to match the data. For example, for the b-tagging effi ciency, which is the main source of uncertainty in the tt\u00af/Wt yields in the SRs as well as in WW CRs, the combination of these two re gions in the statistical analysis leads to an anti-correlation between the SR yields of the WW and tt\u00af/Wt backgrounds. Changes in the b-tagging efficiency simultaneously increase/decrease the yields of tt\u00af/Wt and WW backgrounds, resulting in a small uncertainty in the combined yields of the processes but large uncertainties in the individual components. Fig. 8 shows the combined mT distribution for N jet \u2264 1. The bot tom panel of Fig. 8 shows the difference between the data and the total estimated background compared to the mT distribution of a SM Higgs boson with mH = 125 GeV. The total signal observed (see Table 5) of about 1000 events is in agreement, in both shape and rate, with the expected SM signal.    The theory uncertainties in the non-resonant WW background produce one of the largest uncertainties, of the order of 6%, in the measured ggF cross-section. The uncertainty in the ratio of gg \u2192 WW to qq \u2192 WW comes from the limited NLO accuracy of the gg \u2192 WW production cross-section [38]. The resulting uncer tainty in the cross-section when using acceptance criteria similar to those in this analysis was evaluated in Ref. [79] for Njet = 0 and for Njet = 1. In the Njet\u22652 VBF SR, the 12% uncertainty in the WW background originates from the matching and UEPS mod elling of qq \u2192 WW. The amount of ggF contamination in the VBF region is subject to QCD scale uncertainties and this produces an uncertainty of about 13% in the measured VBF cross-section. The statistical uncertainty of the MC simulation has a relatively large impact, especially for the VBF cross-section measurement, where it contributes 21%. The predicted cross-section times branching fraction values are 10.4 \u00b1 0.6 pb and 0.81 \u00b1 0.02 pb for ggF and VBF [23], respec tively. The 68% and 95% confidence level two-dimensional contours of \u03c3ggF \u2022 BH\u2192WW * and \u03c3VBF \u2022 BH\u2192WW * are shown in Fig. 9 and are consistent with the SM predictions.
