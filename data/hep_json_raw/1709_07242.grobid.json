The heavy resonance is assumed to decay to \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 with at least one tau lepton decaying to final states with hadrons and a neutrino. The search is performed in the mass range of 0.2-2.25 TeV for Higgs bosons and 0.2-4.0 TeV for Z bosons. The data are in good agreement with the background predicted by the Standard Model. The results are interpreted in benchmark scenarios. In the context of the hMSSM scenario, the data exclude tan \u03b2 > 1.0 for m A = 0.25 TeV and tan \u03b2 > 42 for m A = 1.5 TeV at the 95% confidence level. For the Sequential Standard Model, Z SSM with m Z < 2.42 TeV is excluded at 95% confidence level, while Z NU with m Z < 2.25 TeV is excluded for the non-universal G(221) model that exhibits enhanced couplings to third-generation fermions.",

            "text": "The Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) [15,17,18] is the simplest extension of the SM that includes supersymmetry. The MSSM requires two Higgs doublets of opposite hypercharge. Assuming that CP symmetry is conserved, this results in one CPodd (A) and two CP-even (h, H) neutral Higgs bosons and two charged Higgs bosons (H \u00b1 ). At tree level, the properties of the Higgs sector in the MSSM depend on only two non-SM parameters, which can be chosen to be the mass of the CP-odd Higgs boson, m A , and the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two Higgs doublets, tan \u03b2. Beyond tree level, a number of additional parameters affect the Higgs sector, the choice of which defines various MSSM benchmark scenarios. In the m mod+ h scenario [19], the top-squark mixing parameter is chosen such that the mass of the lightest CP-even Higgs boson, m h , is close to the measured mass of the Higgs boson that was discovered at the LHC. A different approach is employed in the hMSSM scenario [20,21] in which the measured value of m h can be used, with certain assumptions, to predict the remaining masses and couplings of the MSSM Higgs bosons without explicit reference to the soft supersymmetry-breaking parameters. The couplings of the MSSM heavy Higgs bosons to down-type fermions are enhanced with respect to the SM Higgs boson for large tan \u03b2 values, resulting in increased branching fractions to \u03c4leptons and b-quarks, as well as a higher cross section for Higgs boson production in association with b-quarks. This has motivated a variety of searches for a scalar boson (generically called \u03c6) in \u03c4 \u03c4 and bb final states 1 at LEP [22], the Tevatron [23][24][25] and the LHC [26][27][28][29].",

            "text": "Heavy Z gauge bosons appear in many extensions of the SM [30][31][32][33][34] and while they are typically considered to obey lepton universality, this is not necessarily a requirement. In particular, models in which the Z boson couples preferentially to third-generation fermions may be linked to the high mass of the top quark [35][36][37][38] or to recent indications of lepton flavour universality violation in semi-tauonic B meson decays [39]. One such model is the non-universal G(221) model [36][37][38], which contains a Z NU boson that can exhibit enhanced couplings to tau leptons. In this model the SM SU(2) gauge group is split into two parts: one coupling to fermions of the first two generations and one coupling to third generation fermions. The mixing between these groups is described by the parameter sin 2 \u03c6, with sin 2 \u03c6 < 0.5 corresponding to enhanced third generation couplings. A frequently used benchmark model is the Sequential Standard Model (SSM), which contains a Z SSM boson with couplings identical to the SM Z boson. By evaluating the impact on the signal sensitivity from changing the Z SSM couplings, limits on Z SSM can be reinterpreted for a broad range of models. Indirect limits on Z bosons with non-universal flavour couplings have been derived from measurements at LEP [40]. The most sensitive direct searches for high-mass resonances decaying to ditau final states have been performed by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations using data collected at \u221a s = 8 and 13 TeV [29,41,42].",

The search is performed in the \u03c4 lep \u03c4 had and \u03c4 had \u03c4 had decay modes, where \u03c4 lep represents the decay of a \u03c4 -lepton to an electron or a muon and neutrinos, whereas \u03c4 had represents the decay to one or more hadrons and a neutrino. The search considers narrow resonances 2 with masses of 0.2-2.25 TeV and tan \u03b2 of 1-58 for the MSSM Higgs bosons. For the Z boson search, a mass range of 0.2-4 TeV is considered. Higgs boson production through gluon-gluon fusion and in association with b-quarks is considered (figures 1(a)-1(c)), with the latter mode dominating for high tan \u03b2 values. Hence, both the \u03c4 lep \u03c4 had and \u03c4 had \u03c4 had channels are split into b-tag and b-veto categories, based on the presence or absence of jets tagged as originating from b-quarks in the final state. Since a Z boson is expected to be predominantly produced via a Drell-Yan process (figure 1(d)), there is little gain in splitting the data into b-tag and b-veto categories. Hence, the Z analysis uses an inclusive selection instead.",

            "text": "The production cross sections and branching fractions for the various MSSM scenarios are taken from ref. [60]. The cross sections for gluon-gluon fusion production are calculated using SusHi [61], including NLO supersymmetric-QCD corrections [62][63][64][65][66][67], next-to-nextto-leading-order (NNLO) QCD corrections for the top quark [68][69][70][71][72], as well as light-quark electroweak effects [73,74]. The b-associated production cross sections in the five-flavour scheme are also calculated using SusHi based on bbh@nnlo [75], and those for b-associated production in the four-flavour scheme (where b-quarks are not considered as partons) are calculated according to refs. [76,77]. The final b-associated production cross section is obtained by using the method described in ref. [78] to match the four-flavour and five-flavour scheme cross sections. The masses and mixing (and effective Yukawa couplings) of the Higgs bosons are computed with FeynHiggs [79][80][81][82][83][84] for all scenarios, with the exception of the hMSSM. In the case of the hMSSM scenario, Higgs masses and branching fractions are computed using HDecay [85,86]. Branching fractions for all other scenarios use a combination of results calculated by HDecay, FeynHiggs and PROPHECY4f [87,88].",

The Z/\u03b3 * sample, enriched in events with high invariant mass, was generated with Pythia 8.165 [92,93] using the NNPDF2.3LO PDF set and the A14 tune for the partonshower and underlying-event parameters. Interference between the Z and the SM Z/\u03b3 * production is not included, as it is highly model dependent. Higher-order QCD corrections are applied to the simulated event samples. These corrections to the event yields are made with a mass-dependent rescaling to NNLO in the QCD coupling constant, as calculated with VRAP 0.9 [94] and the CT14NNLO PDF set. Electroweak corrections are not applied to the Z signal samples due to the large model dependence. The multijet background in both channels is estimated using data, while non-multijet backgrounds in which a quark-or gluon-initiated jet is misidentified as a hadronic tau decay (predominantly W + jets and tt) are modelled using data in the \u03c4 lep \u03c4 had channel and simulation with data-driven corrections in the \u03c4 had \u03c4 had channel, as described in section 6. The remaining background contributions arise from Z/\u03b3 * +jets, W + jets, tt, single topquark and diboson (W W , W Z and ZZ) production. These contributions are estimated using the simulated event samples described below.",

The AZNLO tune was used, with PDF set CTEQ6L1, for the modelling of non-perturbative effects. Photon emission from electroweak vertices and charged leptons was performed with Photos++ 3.52 [96]. The same setup was used to simulate W + jets events for background subtraction in the control regions of the \u03c4 lep \u03c4 had channel. The Z/\u03b3 * +jets samples were simulated in slices with different masses of the off-shell boson. The event yields are corrected with a mass-dependent rescaling at NNLO in the QCD coupling constant, computed with VRAP 0.9 and the CT14NNLO PDF set. Mass-dependent electroweak corrections are computed at NLO with Mcsanc 1.20 [97], and these include photon-induced contributions (\u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 via t-and u-channel processes) computed with the MRST2004QED PDF set [98].",

It employs a multivariate technique based on jet energy, vertexing and tracking variables to determine the likelihood that the jet originates from or is heavily contaminated by pile-up [126]. In order to identify jets containing b-hadrons (b-jets), a multivariate algorithm is used, which is based on the presence of tracks with a large impact parameter with respect to the primary vertex, the presence of displaced secondary vertices and the reconstructed flight paths of b-and c-hadrons associated with the jet [127,128]. The algorithm has an average efficiency of 70% for b-jets and rejections of approximately 13, 56 and 380 for c-jets, hadronic tau decays and jets initiated by light quarks or gluons, respectively, as determined in simulated tt events.",

A Boosted Decision Tree (BDT) identification procedure, based on calorimetric shower shapes and tracking information is used to reject backgrounds from jets [130,131]. Two \u03c4 had-vis identification criteria are used: \"loose\" and \"medium\", specified in section 5. The criteria correspond to efficiencies of about 60% (50%) and 55% (40%) in Z/\u03b3 * \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 events and rejections of about 30 (30) and 50 (100) in multijet events, for one-track (three-track) \u03c4 had-vis candidates, respectively. An additional dedicated likelihood-based veto is used to reduce the number of electrons misidentified as \u03c4 had-vis in the \u03c4 lep \u03c4 had channel, providing 95% efficiency and a background rejection between 20 and 200, depending on the pseudorapidity of the \u03c4 had-vis candidate.",

Due to the limited size of the control regions, the |\u2206\u03c6(p \u03c4 had-vis T , E miss T )| dependence is extracted as a sequential correction and is only applied in the b-veto channel. The selection for W-FR and MJ-FR are the same as for SR with modifications described in the following. The medium \u03c4 had-vis identification criterion is replaced by a very loose  criterion with an efficiency of about 99% for \u03c4 had-vis and a rejection of about 2 (3) for one-track (three-track) jets. Events passing the medium identification criterion enter the fake-factor numerators, while those failing enter the denominators. The very loose identification reduces differences between f W and f MJ , as it tends to reject gluon-initiated jets, enhancing the fraction of quark-initiated jets in W-FR and MJ-FR. This selection is also applied consistently to CR-1. A comparison of the two fake-factors and their respective |\u2206\u03c6(p \u03c4 had-vis T , E miss T )| corrections are shown in figures 4(a) and 4(b). In MJ-FR, the selected lepton must fail isolation.

The uncertainty related to the overlay of pile-up events is estimated by varying the average number of interactions per bunch crossing by 9%. The uncertainties related to the detector simulation manifest themselves through the efficiency of the reconstruction, identification and triggering algorithms, and the energy scale and resolution for electrons, muons, \u03c4 had-vis , (b-)jets and the E miss T soft term. These uncertainties are considered for all simulated samples; their impact is taken into account when estimating signal and background contributions and when subtracting contamination from regions in the data-driven estimates. The effects of the particle energy-scale uncertainties are propagated to E miss T . The uncertainty in the \u03c4 had-vis identification efficiency as determined from measurements of Z \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 events is 5-6%. At high p T , there are no abundant sources of real hadronic tau decays from which an efficiency measurement could be made. Rather, the tau identification is studied in high-p T dijet events as a function of the jet p T , which indicates that there is no degradation in the modelling of the detector response as a function of the p T of tau candidates. Based on the limited precision of these studies, an additional uncertainty of 20%/TeV (25%/TeV) for one-track (three-track) \u03c4 had-vis candidates with p T > 150 GeV is assigned. The \u03c4 had-vis trigger efficiency uncertainty is 3-14%. The uncertainty in the \u03c4 had-vis energy scale is 2-3%. The probability for electrons to be misidentified as \u03c4 had-vis is measured with a precision of 3-14% [131].

A single 90% CL eigenvector variation uncertainty is used, based on the CT14nnlo PDF set. The variations amount to a \u223c5% uncertainty in the total number of Z/\u03b3 * +jets events within the acceptance. For diboson production, an uncertainty of 10% is used [99,136]. For tt [108] and single top-quark [109,110] production, the assigned 6% uncertainty is based on PDF, scale and top-quark mass variations. Additional uncertainties related to initial-and final-state radiation modelling, tune and (for tt only) the choice of hdamp parameter value in Powheg-Box v2, which controls the amount of radiation produced by the parton shower, are also taken into account [137]. The uncertainty due to the hadronisation model is evaluated by comparing tt events generated with Powheg-Box v2 interfaced to either Herwig++ [138] or Pythia 6.

The impact from varying the factorisation and renormalisation scales up and down by a factor of two, either coherently or oppositely, is taken into account. Uncertainties due to the modelling of initial-and final-state radiation, as well as multiple parton interaction are also taken into account. These uncertainties are estimated from variations of the Pythia 8 A14 tune [57] for the b-associated production and the AZNLO Pythia 8 tune [56] for the gluon-gluon fusion production. The envelope of the variations resulting from the use of the alternative PDFs in the PDF4LHC15 nlo nf4 30 (PDF4LHC15 nlo 100) [139] set is used to estimate the PDF uncertainty for the b-associated (gluon-gluon fusion) production. The total uncertainty for the MSSM Higgs boson samples is typically 1-4%, which is dominated by variations of the radiation and multiple parton interactions, with minor impact from scale variations. The Z signal acceptance uncertainties are expected to be negligible.",

Signal and background predictions depend on systematic uncertainties, which are parameterised as nuisance parameters that are constrained using Gaussian probability density functions. The asymptotic approximation is used with the test statisticq \u00b5 [141] to compare the likelihoods of the null hypothesis (SM only) and the assumed signal hypothesis (SM plus signal) given the data. The bin widths are chosen to ensure a sufficient number of background events in each bin.

            "text": "A search for neutral Higgs bosons as predicted in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model and Z bosons decaying to a pair of \u03c4 -leptons is performed using a data sample from proton-proton collisions at \u221a s = 13 TeV recorded by the ATLAS detector at the LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb \u22121 . The \u03c4 e \u03c4 had , \u03c4 \u00b5 \u03c4 had and \u03c4 had \u03c4 had channels are analysed and no indication of an excess over the expected SM background is found. Upper limits on the cross section for the production of scalar and Z bosons times the branching fraction to ditau final states are set at 95% CL, significantly increasing the sensitivity and the explored mass range compared to previous searches. They are in the range 0.78-0.0058 pb (0.70-0.0037 pb) for gluon-gluon fusion (b-associated) production of scalar bosons with masses of 0.2-2.25 TeV and 1.56-0.0072 pb for Drell-Yan production of Z bosons with masses of 0.2-4 TeV. In the context of the hMSSM scenario, the most stringent limits for the combined search exclude tan \u03b2 > 1.0 for m A = 0.25 TeV and tan \u03b2 > 42 for m A = 1.5 TeV at 95% CL. In the context of the Sequential Standard Model, Z SSM bosons with masses less than 2.42 TeV are excluded at 95% CL, while m Z NU < 2.25-2.60 TeV is excluded in the range 0.03 < sin 2 \u03c6 < 0.5 in the non-universal G(221) model.

These features arise primarily because of a deficit of events in the range 200-250 GeV followed by a mild excess in the range 300-400 GeV in figure 5(c), and by a consistent deficit of events across the whole range in figure 5(d).
