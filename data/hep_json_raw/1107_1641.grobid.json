            "text": "A measurement of jet activity in the rapidity interval bounded by a dijet system is presented. Events are vetoed if a jet with transverse momentum greater than 20 GeV is found between the two boundary jets. The fraction of dijet events that survive the jet veto is presented for boundary jets that are separated by up to six units of rapidity and with mean transverse momentum 50 < p T < 500 GeV. The mean multiplicity of jets above the veto scale in the rapidity interval bounded by the dijet system is also presented as an alternative method for quantifying perturbative QCD emission. The data are compared to a next-to-leading order plus parton shower prediction from the powheg-box, an all-order resummation using the hej calculation and the pythia, herwig++ and alpgen event generators. The measurement was performed using pp collisions at \u221a s = 7 TeV using data recorded by the ATLAS detector in 2010.",

The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) offers the opportunity to study this process at an increased centreof-mass energy and with a wider coverage in rapidity between jets. Historically, the main purpose of these measurements has been to search for evidence of colour singlet exchange. With this aim, a very low cut on the total hadronic activity between the jets (less than a few GeV) was traditionally chosen, to suppress contributions from colour octet exchange.",

This approach is useful because it allows a diverse range of perturbative QCD phenomena to be studied, as the veto scale is chosen to be much larger than \u039b QCD . First, BFKLlike dynamics 1 [10][11][12][13] are expected to become increasingly important for large rapidity intervals [14][15][16][17]. Alternatively, the effects of wide-angle soft-gluon radiation can be studied in the limit that the average dijet transverse momentum is much larger than the scale used to veto on additional jet activity [18,19]. Finally, colour singlet exchange is expected to JHEP09(2011)053 be important if both limits are satisfied at the same time, i.e the jets are widely separated and the jet veto scale is small in comparison to the dijet transverse momentum. The measurement is therefore targeted at studying the effects of QCD radiation in those regions of phase space that may not be adequately described by standard event generators.",

Jets are required to have transverse momentum p T > 20 GeV and rapidity |y| < 4.4, ensuring that they are in a region in which the jet energy scale has been validated (section 6). The dijet system is identified using two different selection criteria. In the first, the two highest transverse momentum jets in the event are used, which probes wide-angle soft gluon radiation in p T -ordered jet configurations. In the second, the most forward and the most backward jets in the event are used (i.e. those with the largest rapidity separation, \u2206y), which favours BFKL-like dynamics because the dijet invariant mass is much larger than the transverse momentum of the jets. For both definitions, the mean transverse momentum of the jets that define the dijet system, p T , is required to be greater than 50 GeV. This ensures that the measurement is in the high efficiency region of the calorimeter jet trigger (section 7). Two variables are used to quantify the amount of additional radiation in the rapidity interval bounded by the dijet system. The first is the gap fraction, which is the fraction of events that do not have an additional jet with a transverse momentum greater than a given veto scale, Q 0 , in the rapidity interval bounded by the dijet system. The default value of the veto scale is chosen to be Q 0 = 20 GeV. The second variable is the mean number of jets with p T > Q 0 in the rapidity interval bounded by the dijet system. The measurements of these two variables are fully corrected for experimental effects. The final distributions therefore correspond to the 'hadron-level', in which the jets are reconstructed using all final state particles that have a proper lifetime longer than 10 ps. This includes muons and neutrinos.",

The measurement is not particularly sensitive to non-perturbative physics because Q 0 is chosen to be much greater than \u039b QCD . The net effect of the non-perturbative physics corrections was estimated by turning the hadronisation and underlying event on and off in pythiathe resulting shift in the gap fraction was less than 2% and the change in the mean number of jets in the rapidity interval bounded by the dijet system was less than 4%.",

In this BFKL-inspired limit, hej reproduces the full QCD results and is especially suited for events with at least two jets separated by a large rapidity interval. 3 The events were generated with the MSTW 2008 NLO PDF set [29] and the partons were clustered into jets using the anti-k t algorithm with distance parameter R = 0.6. The renormalisation/factorisation scale (one parameter in hej) was chosen to be the p T of the leading parton and the uncertainty due to this choice was estimated by increasing and decreasing the scale by a factor of two. The uncertainty from the choice of PDF was estimated using the full set of eigenvector errors provided by MSTW and also by changing the PDF to CTEQ61 [37]. The overall uncertainty in the hej calculation is dominated by the scale choice and is typically 5% for the gap fraction and 8% for the mean number of jets in the rapidity interval bounded by the dijet system. These uncertainties are larger than the non-perturbative physics corrections and the hej parton-level predictions are therefore used for data-theory comparisons.",

The corrections are derived for jets with p T > 10 GeV at the EM scale and parameterised as a function of jet p T and |\u03b7|. An additional correction factor is applied to the \u03b7 of jets that fall in the crack-regions of the detector, to remove the bias caused by the constituents of jets falling in regions of very different calorimeter response.

The mean number of jets in the rapidity interval was studied as a function of p T and \u2206y. In all cases, the data were corrected for detector effects. The data show the expected behaviour of a reduction of gap events, or an increase in jet activity, for large values of p T or \u2206y [18]. The pythia, herwig++ and alpgen leading-order MC event generators were compared to the data. It was observed that pythia and herwig++ gave the best description of the data as a function of p T and that pythia gave the best description of the data as a function of \u2206y. alpgen did not describe the data well at large values of p T or \u2206y.",
