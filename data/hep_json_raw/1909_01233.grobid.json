This allowed to perform precision measurements and studies of fundamental symmetries, and searches of New Physics phenomena. In this overview, the results of KLOE and KLOE-2 Collaborations are presented. The most recent results from the KLOE experiment are discussed, covering: the measurement of the running fine-structure constant \u03b1em, the Dalitz plot measurement of \u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 , the search of a U boson, tests of discrete symmetries and quantum decoherence.",

            "text": "The DA\u03a6NE facility is a e + e \u2212 collider that operates at a center of mass energy adjusted to the \u03c6 meson mass (m \u03c6 \u2248 1.019 GeV), which decays predominantly to charged (49%) and neutral kaons (34%) , and to the \u03c1\u03c0, \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 (15%) and \u03b7\u03b3 (1.3%) final states. Being a e + e \u2212 collider, DA\u03a6NE provides a clean experimental environment, avoiding lots of strong-interaction backgrounds present in the hadronic accelerators. The initial-state energy is well known, allowing a precise calculation of the kinematics of the events, making the final states easy to reconstruct by looking at the event topologies. Also, DA\u03a6NE, working at a fixed center-of-mass energy, allows to scan a broad energy range for measurements of the hadronic cross section or, e.g., dark mediator searches, exploiting events where one of the electrons (positrons) in the initial state radiated a photon, called initial-state radiation (ISR) events. For the ISR events, the invariant mass M hadr of the hadronic system is reduced, thus, giving access to an energy range M hadr < \u221a s. For kaon physics, the main experimental advantage is the possibility to select a pure, kinematically well-defined K S beam. The \u03c6 particle is a vector meson with well-defined quantum numbers J P C = 1 \u2212\u2212 , decaying via the strong, parityconserving process \u03c6 \u2192 K L K S , and at DA\u03a6NE those neutral kaons are produced as almost collinear, monochromatic pairs with longitudinal momenta of 100 MeV/c and transverse momenta of 15 MeV/c. The reconstruction of the K L particles, with larger decay times, interacting in the calorimeter allows to efficiently tag the K S beam. Finally, at DA\u03a6NE it is possible to study the entangled quantum system formed by the correlated neutral kaons with high statistics and in a low-background environment. The entangled pairs can be used to study a variety of interferometric patterns analogical to the one observed for entangled photons. Those phenomena, being a manifestation of quantum interference, provide access to the studies of the QM basics, as well as to precise CP, T and CPT symmetry tests.",

In 2008, the DA\u03a6NE facility underwent an upgrade which included a new interaction scheme [3]. At the same time, new detectors were added to the KLOE experiment to face a new physics program [4,5]. Starting in 2014 and until March 2018, the new KLOE-2 experiment has been collecting data. In this period, a sample of 5.5 fb \u22121 has been acquired. Together with the KLOE data sample, the total collected data sets correspond to an integrated luminosity of 8 fb \u22121 , which with about 2.4 \u00d7 10 10 \u03c6-mesons recorded, represents the largest sample acquired at a \u03c6-factory at the moment.",

            "text": "In analogy to the SM case, since the U boson needs to be massive, one can implement a spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism of the U (1) DM symmetry, introducing a Higgs-like, h particle, or dark Higgs. The mass hierarchy between the h and the U boson is not constrained by the theory [50]. The KLOE-2 Collaboration investigated also the Higgsstrahlung process, sensitive to the dark coupling constant \u03b1 DM . The invisible scenario, where the dark Higgs is lighter than the U boson and escapes detection was considered [51]. In this case, the expected signal is a muon pair from the U boson decay plus missing energy. The analysis was performed using two data samples: one collected on the \u03c6 peak ( (s) = 1019 MeV) and a second one at \u221a s = 1000 MeV (off-peak sample), where all the backgrounds from the \u03a6 decays are strongly suppressed. No signal signature was observed and a Bayesian limit on the number of signal events at 90% CL was evaluated, bin-by-bin, for the onpeak and off-peak sample separately and the results were presented in terms of \u03b1 DM \u00d7 \u03b5 2 . Assuming the hypothesis of \u03b1 DM = \u03b1, the upper limits on the kinetic mixing parameter \u03b5 ranges between 10 \u22124 and 10 \u22123 . U boson radiative production: In KLOE-2 also both leptonic and hadronic decays of the U boson produced in e + e \u2212 annihilation were investigated by studying the reactions: U\u03b3 ISR \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 , \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and U\u03b3 ISR \u2192 e + e \u2212 , all of them by means of the Initial State Radiation Method. The analysis of the U\u03b3 ISR \u2192 e + e \u2212 reaction, on a sample of 1.5 fb \u22121 , profited of the high rate of radiative Bhabha events produced in KLOE and allowed to search in the lower mass region, setting limits down to 5 MeV in the di-electron invariant mass, or U boson mass. In contrast, a search using the decay in muon-pairs was performed to explore the higher mass region. However, the result was updated by studying the decay of the U boson into pion-pair, which is of special interest in order to recover sensitivity in the mass range of the \u03c1 \u2212 \u03c9 resonance region. About this mass, the mixing of the \u03b3 to the \u03c1 meson makes the decay into hadrons more probable. For this reason, the searches for the U boson decaying into \u00b5-pairs have no sensitivity in this mass range. To achieve the desired reach, KLOE-2 re-analyzed the U \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 decay at full statistics together with the decay into \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 . The combined upper limit was extracted for the mass region between 650 MeV and 987 MeV. Fig. 6: 90% CL exclusion plot for \u03b5 2 as a function of the U-boson mass. The solid lines are the limits from the muon and electron anomaly. The gray line shows the U boson parameters that could explain the discrepancy between SM prediction and the experimental value of muon anomalous magnetic momentum, a \u00b5 , with a 2 \u03c3 error band (gray dashed lines). The presented upper limits correspond to the U \u2192 e + e \u2212 limit from the \u03c6 \u2192 \u03b7U dalitz decay (KLOE(1)), the U \u2192 e + e \u2212 limit (KLOE(3)) from radiative production, the U \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 constraint (KLOE(2)) and the combined limit from U \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ,\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 at full KLOE statistics (KLOE(4)) in comparison with the competitive limits by BaBar [52], NA48/2 [53] and LHCb experiments [54].",

            "text": "The CPT theorem [63] states that any quantum field theory that fulfills several commonly accepted requirements such as locality, Lorentz invariance, spin-statistics relation etc., must be invariant to the combined CPT transformation. All particle interaction theories that form the SM belong to that category. Possible violation of CPT symmetry can be attributed to effects at the Planck scale, where physical interactions are believed to be dominated by quantum gravity (QG). In particular, QG entails a fundamental CPT non-invariance in the environment of microscopic black-hole background [64,65] leading to the manifestation of the Planck-scale CPT asymmetry as a slight dissipative effect in the energy scale attainable in current experiments. As suggested in Ref. [66], QG effects should modify the Lagrangian of the SM of interactions by adding a small CPT-violating term and thus inducing also the Lorentz invariance breakdown. This idea led to the formulation of the Standard Model Extension (SME) [67], a general framework for testing the CPT violation effects in a large spectrum of experiments. KLOE obtained the most precise results on the CPT-violating parameter \u03b4, as well as SME coupling constants of the SM field to a hypothetical Lorentzviolating and CPT non-invariant background field [68], based on the analysis of the \u03c6 \u2192 K S K L \u2192 (\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 )(\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) process. In the SME framework the CPT violation manifests itself indirectly via Lorentz symmetry violation effects, namely the observables become dependent on the meson momentum with respect to the distant stars. The KLOE results reached a sensitivity at the level of 10 \u221218 GeV [69], which is several orders of magnitude more precise than the results obtained with other neutral meson systems [70,71,72,73] b . The results were obtained with a data sample corresponding to 1.7 fb \u22121 integrated luminosity, and are mainly limited by the statistical errors.",

This allows for a model-independent test of T and CPT symmetries. Such a test has been performed only in the case of neutral B mesons, where the first evidence of T violation was observed [86]. In the case of KLOE-2, it can be pursued with the K 0 \u2212K 0 system [87]. For this purpose, quantum-entangled meson pairs are used to identify a particle initial state by the decay of its entangled partner, while the final state can be tagged using the semi-leptonic and hadronic decays into two and three pions. Then, two T violating observables can be defined, by using the ratios between the rates of the two classes of processes K S K L \u2192 \u03c0 \u00b1 e \u2213 \u03bd, 3\u03c0 0 and K S K L \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , \u03c0 \u00b1 e \u2213 \u03bd: R 2 (\u2206t) = P [K 0 (0) \u2192 K \u2212 (\u2206t)] P [K \u2212 (0) \u2192 K 0 (\u2206t)] \u223c I(\u03c0 + e \u2212\u03bd , 3\u03c0 0 ; \u2206t) I(\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , \u03c0 \u2212 e + \u03bd; \u2206t)",
