It is based on an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb \u22121 of pp collisions at \u221a s = 13 TeV collected by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC. The final state of interest is a disappearing track accompanied by at least one jet with high transverse momentum from initial-state radiation or by four jets from the gluino decay chain. The use of short track segments reconstructed from the innermost tracking layers significantly improves the sensitivity to short chargino lifetimes. The results are found to be consistent with Standard Model predictions. Exclusion limits are set at 95% confidence level on the mass of charginos and gluinos for different chargino lifetimes. For a pure wino with a lifetime of about 0.2 ns, chargino masses up to 460 GeV are excluded. For the strong production channel, gluino masses up to 1.65 TeV are excluded assuming a chargino mass of 460 GeV and lifetime of 0.2 ns.",

            "text": "1 Introduction Supersymmetry (SUSY) [1-6] is a space-time symmetry that relates fermions and bosons. It predicts new particles that differ from their Standard Model (SM) partners by a half unit of spin. If R-parity is conserved [7], SUSY particles are produced in pairs and decay such that their final products consist only of SM particles and the stable lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP). In many supersymmetric models, the supersymmetric partners of the SM W boson fields, the wino fermions, are the lightest gaugino states. In this case, the lightest of the charged mass eigenstates, a chargino, and the lightest of the neutral mass eigenstates, a neutralino, are both almost pure wino and nearly mass-degenerate. As a result, the lightest chargino can have a lifetime long enough that it can reach the AT-LAS detector before decaying. For example, anomaly-mediated supersymmetry breaking (AMSB) scenarios [8,9] naturally predict a pure wino LSP, which is a dark-matter candidate. The mass-splitting between the charged and neutral wino (\u2206m\u03c7 1 ) in such models is suppressed at tree level by the approximate custodial symmetry; it has been calculated at the two-loop level to be around 160 MeV [10], corresponding to a chargino lifetime of about 0.2 ns [11]. This prediction for the value of the lifetime is actually a general feature of models with a wino LSP: within the generated models of the ATLAS phenomenological Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (pMSSM) scan [12] that have a wino-like LSP, about 70% have a charged-wino lifetime between 0.15 ns and 0.25 ns. Most of the models in the other 30% have a larger mass-splitting (and therefore the charged wino has a shorter lifetime) due to a non-decoupled higgsino mass. The search presented here is sensitive to a wide range of lifetimes, from 10 ps to 10 ns, and reaches maximum sensitivity for lifetimes around 1 ns.",

            "text": "The decay products of SUSY particles that are strongly mass-degenerate with the lightest neutralino leave little visible energy in the detector. Thus, the corresponding searches represent a significant challenge for the LHC experiments. If a charged SUSY particle produced in a high-energy collider had a relatively long lifetime, it would leave multiple hits 1 in the traversed tracking layers before decaying, and could then be reconstructed as a track segment in the innermost part of the detector [13][14][15]. In the models considered in this paper, a long-lived chargino decays into a pion and the LSP, a neutralino. The pion emitted in the transition from the lightest chargino (\u03c7 \u00b1 1 ) to the lightest neutralino (\u03c7 0 1 ) typically has very low momentum and it is not reconstructed in the detector. The neutralino is assumed to pass through the detector without interacting. A track arising from a long-lived chargino can therefore disappear, i.e., leave hits only in the innermost layers and no hits in the portions of the detector at higher radii. Figure 1 shows an example of a simulated signal event in which a long-lived chargino decays into a neutralino and a low-momentum pion in the ATLAS detector. Searches for long-lived, massive, charged particles using measurements of ionization energy loss and timing information are also sensitive to long-lived charginos [16][17][18], with a lower efficiency for selecting signals with lifetimes around 0. relative to the disappearing-track signature. The disappearing-track signature provides the most sensitive search to date for SUSY models with charginos with O(ns) lifetimes.",

These searches excluded chargino masses below 270 GeV and 260 GeV respectively, with a chargino proper lifetime (\u03c4\u03c7\u00b1 1 ) of 0.2 ns. In the previous ATLAS analysis, a special tracking algorithm was used to reconstruct short tracks, and the search was sensitive to charginos decaying at radii larger than about 30 cm. A crucial improvement in the analysis described here is the use of even shorter tracks, called tracklets, which allows the reconstruction of charginos decaying at radii from about 12 cm to 30 cm. The use of these tracklets is possible thanks to the new innermost tracking layer [21,22] installed during the LHC long shutdown between Run 1 and Run 2. The use of shorter tracklets significantly extends the sensitivity to smaller chargino lifetimes.",

The pixel detector spans the radius range from 3 cm to 12 cm, the strip semiconductor tracker (SCT) from 30 cm to 52 cm, and the TRT from 56 cm to 108 cm. The pixel detector has four barrel layers, and three disks in each of the forward and backward regions. The barrel layers surround the beam pipe at radii of 33.3, 50.5, 88.5, and 122.5 mm, covering |\u03b7| < 1.9. These layers are equipped with pixels which have a width of 50 \u00b5m in the transverse direction. The pixel sizes in the longitudinal direction are 250 \u00b5m for the first layer and 400 \u00b5 for the other layers. The innermost layer, the insertable B-layer [21,22], was added during the long shutdown between Run 1 and Run 2 and improves the reconstruction of tracklets by adding an additional measurement point close to the interaction point. The ID is surrounded by a thin superconducting solenoid providing an axial 2 T magnetic field and by a fine-granularity lead/liquid-argon (LAr) electromagnetic calorimeter covering |\u03b7| < 3.2. The calorimeters in the region of 3.1 < |\u03b7| < 4.9 are made of LAr active layers with either copper or tungsten as the absorber material. A steel/scintillator-tile calorimeter provides coverage for hadronic showers in the central pseudorapidity range of |\u03b7| < 1.7. LAr hadronic end-cap calorimeters, which use lead as absorber, cover the forward region of 1.5 < |\u03b7| < 3.2. The muon spectrometer with an air-core toroid magnet system surrounds the calorimeters.

If the gluino mass is relatively light, however, gluino pair production becomes the dominant process, and charginos can be produced in cascade decays of the gluino. For large mass separations between the gluino and the chargino, the relatively large transverse momentum (p T ) transferred to the chargino typically leads to higher kinematic selection efficiencies and larger chargino decay radii relative to charginos from gaugino pair production. Two complementary searches are described here: one targets direct electroweak-gaugino pair production and the other targets gluino pair production in which at least one long-lived chargino is produced in the subsequent decay of the gluinos. In both searches, events are selected with a trigger based on the magnitude of the missing transverse momentum in the event (E miss T ). A candidate event is required to have at least one \"pixel tracklet\", which is a tracklet with no associated SCT hits. Candidate pixel tracklets are required to have p T > 5 GeV. Figure 2. Example diagrams of the benchmark signal processes used in this analysis. In the case of direct chargino/neutralino production (a), the signal signature consists of a long-lived chargino, missing transverse momentum and initial-state radiation. In the case of the strong channel (b), each gluino decays into two quarks and a chargino or neutralino. A long-lived chargino, missing transverse momentum and multiple quarks, which are observed as jets, are the signatures of this signal.",

Hadrons or leptons in these events can be reconstructed as a pixel tracklet if they interact with the detector material and any hits in the tracking detectors after the pixel detector are not assigned to the reconstructed tracklet. Interactions that contribute to this background include severe multiple-scattering, hadronic interactions or, in the case of leptons, bremsstrahlung, as shown in figure 3a and 3b. The other main category of background is from \"fake\" tracklets, which originate from random combinations of hits from two or more particles, as shown in figure 3c.  Figure 3. Sketch of the different background components in the search with pixel tracklets. Thin solid and dotted red lines show trajectories of charged and neutral particles respectively. Thick blue lines show reconstructed pixel tracklets. (a) A hadron undergoing a hard scattering can yield track segments in the pixel and SCT detector that are not recognised as belonging to the same track, thus faking a pixel tracklet. (b) A lepton emitting hard photon radiation could be identified as a pixel tracklet through a similar mechanism. (c) A pixel tracklet can arise from a random combination of hits created by different particles in close proximity.",

A lepton-veto is used to suppress background events from W /Z + jets and top-pair production processes. Kinematic requirements, optimised for each channel, are applied to enhance the signal purity in the event samples. After selection, the search is performed by looking for an excess of candidate events in the p T distribution of pixel tracklets. The shapes of the p T spectrum for the background from hadrons, muons, electrons, and fake tracklets are derived from data using dedicated techniques for each background process. A fit to the observed p T distribution to extract the normalisation of the total background component and the signal strength is performed simultaneously in a low-E miss T control region, two fake-tracklet control regions, and a high-E miss T signal region. The regions are defined by the requirements described in section 5 and in section 6.3. The expected signal spectrum and yield are estimated from simulation and the measured detector performance.

The cross-sections for the strong production are calculated in the same way as in the electroweak channel, adding the resummation of soft gluon emission at next-to-leading-logarithm accuracy (NLO + NLL) [34]. In both channels, an envelope of cross-section predictions is defined using the 68% confidence level (CL) ranges of the CTEQ6.6 PDF set [35], including the \u03b1 S uncertainty, and MSTW2008 PDF set [36], together with variations of the factorisation and renormalisation scales by factors of two or one half. The nominal cross-section value is taken to be the midpoint of the envelope and the uncertainty assigned is half of the full width of the envelope, following the PDF4LHC recommendations [37]. For the strong production mode, the branching ratio of the gluino decay is assumed to be 1/3 for each of the following decays:g \u2192 qq\u03c7 0 ,g \u2192 qq\u03c7 \u2212 andg \u2192 qq\u03c7 + . Only first-and second-generation quarks (d, u, s, c) are considered. Direct electroweak-gaugino production is not considered in the strong channel. The cross-section for the electroweak production, including at least one chargino, varies from 47 pb to 13 fb as the wino mass increases from 100 GeV to 700 GeV with the uncertainty in the cross-section ranging from 8.6% to 7.3%. The cross-section for gluino production varies from 3.5 pb to 0.36 fb as the gluino mass increases from 700 GeV to 2200 GeV with the uncertainty increasing from 14% to 36%.",

Tracklets are not used in the E miss T calculation. Track reconstruction is performed in two stages. First, standard tracks, referred to as tracks in this paper, are reconstructed using a standard algorithm [50]. Tracks are required to have at least seven hits in the silicon detectors [51]. A typical track for a high-p T charged particle which does not decay or scatter in the ID has four pixel hits, eight SCT hits, and 36 TRT hits at \u03b7 \u2248 0. The track reconstruction is then rerun with looser criteria, requiring at least four pixel-detector hits. The second reconstruction uses only pixel hits not associated with tracks as input, in order to find short tracks which are not reconstructed in the first step. Tracks reconstructed in the second step are referred to as tracklets. The tracklets are then extrapolated to the SCT and TRT detectors, and any compatible hits are assigned to the tracklet candidate. Tracklets are required to have p T > 5 GeV, |\u03b7| < 2.2, and their longitudinal impact parameter 3 |z 0 |, must be smaller than 10 mm. Figure 4 shows the reconstruction efficiency for simulated charginos as a function of the chargino decay radius, where requirements described later in this section are not applied to compute the efficiency except for the disappearance condition for pixel tracklets. By using pixel tracklets rather than tracks, the reconstruction efficiency is improved significantly for charginos decaying at radii less than 300 mm. For charginos with a lifetime of 0.2 ns, which have a mean decay radius of 6 cm, the probability to reconstruct a pixel tracklet is 5-10%; this tracklet reconstruction efficiency is a factor of ten greater than the efficiency obtained using tracks. The inefficiency in reconstructing pixel tracklets for charginos with a lifetime of 0.2 ns is largely due to charginos which decay before reaching the fourth layer of the pixel detector.",

The limit is shown assuming a chargino lifetime of (a) 0.2 ns and (b) 1.0 ns. The yellow band shows the 1\u03c3 region of the distribution of the expected limits. The median of the expected limits is shown by a dashed line. The red line shows the observed limit and the orange dotted lines around it show the impact on the observed limit of the variation of the nominal signal cross-section by \u00b11\u03c3 of its theoretical uncertainties. Observed limits in the electroweak production search are shown as a green shaded region.",
