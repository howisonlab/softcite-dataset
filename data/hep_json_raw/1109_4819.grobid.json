Data from 1350 to 1940 MeV/c are reported in an accompanying paper [1]. They provide evidence for f 0 (2100) \u2192 \u03b7\u03b7, a 2 (1660) \u2192 \u03b7\u03c0 and a broad f 2 (1980) \u2192 \u03b7\u03b7. The first resonance lies above the mass range of present data, but is an important element in 0 + spectroscopy. The a 2 (1660) is strong at higher momenta but, because its threshold is at \u223c 2200 MeV, it makes only a minor contribution to present data up to 1200 MeV/c. The f 2 (1980) plays an important role, since it is broad and extends into the present mass range. We shall provide evidence for an I = 0, J P C 0 ++ resonance at 1770 MeV, decaying to \u03b7\u03b7. This resonance is important in trying to unravel the mysteries concerning the f J (1710) [2], hence in establishing the systematics of 0 + mesons.",

            "text": "At lower masses, there has been earlier evidence from the Crystal Barrel collaboration for an I = 0 resonance whose mass is variously estimated from 1300 to 1380 [3][4][5][6]. There is also an I = 1 resonance at 1450 MeV [7] and finally the well known f 0 (1500). At higher mass, the WA102 collaboration has published evidence for an f 0 (2020) resonance decaying to 4\u03c0 [8]. The experimental conditions and data processing are identical to those of the higher momenta reported in Ref. [1], and we refer to that paper for experimental details. The largest backgrounds are from \u03b7\u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 and \u03c9\u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 , two photons being lost in the former case and one in the latter. Numbers of events and estimated backgrounds are shown in Table 1. Using cross sections observed in these other channels, we find that backgrounds are close to a phase space distribution. They are included in fitting the data, but omitting them has negligible effect on the analysis, where log likelihood changes by < 4. Fig. 1 shows Dalitz plots at the four beam momenta and mass projections on to \u03b7\u03b7 and \u03b7\u03c0. Histograms superimposed on the projections are the result of the maximum likelohood fit described below. There are conspicuous peaks due to f 0 (1500), a 0 (980) and a 2 (1320). The feature of interest is a shoulder at \u223c 1770 MeV in \u03b7\u03b7, clearly visible in Figs. 1(f), (g) and (h) at 900, 1050 and 1200 MeV/c. It is barely visible at the higher momenta reported in Ref. [1]. At 1350 MeV/c, there is a shoulder at \u223c 1770 MeV, and the amplitude analysis gives a small optimum there, but the significance is found to be much less than at lower momenta.",

In making this choice, we are guided by experience that it requires roughly 225 MeV/c of momentum per unit of orbital angular momentum L in the production process. Present data are consistent with this guideline. The last column of Table 2 shows momenta in the decay process at the highest beam momentum of 1200 MeV/c. For the a 0 (980)\u03b7 channel, we require up to L = 3. There is no evidence for the presence of L = 4; this agrees with the expectation that the first 4 \u2212 qq state will lie at a mass of 2300 MeV or above, i.e. a beam momentum of at least 1650 MeV/c. The a 0 (980) is fitted with a Flatt\u00e9 form using parameters derived from earlier data onpp \u2192 \u03b7\u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 at rest [9]. The a 0 (980) signal is slightly stronger in the data than the fit, particularly in Fig.1(i); the fit can be improved by reducing the width of the a 0 (980) by \u223c 20%. The f 0 (1500)\u03c0 channel is described successfully with waves up to L = 2. The strong a 2 (1320)\u03b7 channel requires up to L = 3, but again there is no evidence for L = 4; the 2 + initial state with helicity 0 makes quite a significant L = 3 contribution: (4 \u2212 8)% at 900 MeV/c and above.",

The fit is made by the maximum likelihood method. Our definition is such that a change of log likelihood of 0.5 corresponds to one standard deviation for a change of one parameter. The acceptance of the detector is simulated by Monte Carlo events, processed through exactly the same selection procedure as data; statistics of accepted Monte Carlo events are roughly 4 times those of data events. The fitting algorithm is sufficiently fast that the amplitude analysis produces a fit in roughly 60 seconds of computing. This is sufficiently fast that we have been able to examine a large number (> 1500) of trials with varying ingredients in order to study the systematics of the fit, its stability and sensitivity to every channel. Although some ambiguities are present at individual momenta (particularly between L = 0 and L = 2 and between L = 1 and L = 3), we have located only one solution having a smooth variation of magnitude, and particularly phase, with momentum.

However, spin 2 still shows some optimum at a similar mass to spin 0. We find this is due to feed-through from mis-identified spin 0 signal. The detector has holes around the beam with an opening angle of 12 \u2022 . This incomplete coverage The fits with spin 2 use five partial waves 1 D 2 , 3 P 1 , 2 + (m = 0 and 1) and 3 F 3 , while fits with spin 0 use two partial waves 1 S 0 and 3 P 1 . Statistically, we would expect the fits with spin 2 to be better than those with spin 0 by 3 in log likelihood, because of the 6 extra fitting parameters. In practice, we find this to be an under-estimate, since certain combinations of amplitudes producing a J = 2 resonance with L = 0 and 1 can simulate closely the flat angular distribution of the dominant 1 S 0 amplitude producing J = 0. To examine this, our second simulation is to fit fake J = 2 resonances of width 220 MeV to the simulated data sets. What we observe in 10 such trials is that the fake 2 + signal improves log likelihood by an average of 17 \u00b1 3. This sets a scale of what may be fitted incorrectly by spin 2; any improvement smaller than this cannot be believed. Our conclusion is that a fake 2 + signal produced with L = 0 or 1 from 5 initial partial waves can be expected to fit the data better than a fake J = 0, produced from 2 initial partial waves, by approximately 12 in log likelihood. If we use this result, the conclusion is that J = 0 is preferred over J = 2 by \u223c 46 in log likelihood at 900 MeV/c, by \u223c 46 at 1050 MeV/c and by \u223c 41 at 1200 MeV/c. These are statistically each over 9 standard deviations. If, pessimistically, we ignore the difference in the number of fitted partial waves and use just raw differences in log likelihood between spin 0 and 2, the discrimination is still over 8 standard deviations at each momentum. Fig. 5(d) shows log likelihood versus the width of the f 0 (1770) at 1050 and 1200 MeV/c, where the data are most definitive. At other beam momenta, the optimum is somewhat less well defined and flattens out at large widths. From our studies with a variety of ingredients, we estimate that the systematic errors on the mass and width of the resonance are respectively \u00b112 and \u00b140 MeV.",

Secondly, a partial wave analysis of J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3(4\u03c0) has fitted 4\u03c0 peaks at 1780 MeV with J = 0 [13]. The GAMS collaboration has reported [14] an X(1740) decaying to \u03b7\u03b7 at 1744 \u00b1 15 MeV, but they find a width < 90 MeV. Their angular distribution is flat, but spin 0 is not claimed because of uncertainty about the production mechanism. E760 data [15] onpp \u2192 \u03b7\u03b7\u03c0 0 show peaks at 1500, 1748 \u00b1 10 and 2100 MeV; they do not report a spin-parity analysis. In view of the fact that we observe strong production of f 0 (1500) and f 0 (2100) in our \u03b7\u03b7\u03c0 0 data, it seems plausible that their peak at \u223c 1750 MeV may be the same resonance as we report here. Their width of 264 \u00b1 25 MeV is acceptably close to ours. The BES group observes an f 0 at 1781 MeV in J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3(K + K \u2212 ) [16].",

            "text": "There is a long-standing debate over the spin of f J (1710), reported by the Particle Data Group as having a mass of 1712 \u00b1 8 MeV and a width of 133 \u00b1 14 MeV. The mass we observe, 1770 MeV, seems too far removed from 1712 MeV to be the same resonance. It seems likely that there is one resonance at 1710 MeV with J = 0 or 2 and a second at 1770 MeV. This is what the BES collaboration found [16]. There is then the possibility that the f J (1710) is also weakly present in our data. At 900 MeV/c, there is a small surplus of events in the \u03b7\u03b7 projection of Fig. 1(f) from 1600 to 1700 MeV. At 1200 MeV/c there is again some indication of extra events in four bins close to 1700 MeV. Our fits include the 500 MeV wide f 2 (1980) demanded by the data of Ref. [1] at higher beam momenta. In ref. [1], the 2 + signal is visible over the whole mass range from 1550 to 2000 MeV. The cos \u03b1 dependence of Fig. 3(a) at 1200 MeV/c is again clear evidence for the presence of non-zero spin, but it does not appear to be narrowly concentrated in mass. Again, it is to be associated with f 2 (1980). At lower beam momenta, where the phase space is limited, there is the possibility of confusion between f 2 (1980) and f 2 (1710). At all beam momenta, we have tried adding to the present fit f 0 (1712) or f 2 (1712) with the PDG width of 133 MeV. Improvements to the fit are listed in columns (c) and (d) of Table 3 respectively. They are not significant, compared with our test with fake signals; they make no visible improvement to mass projections. If one tries to fit the extra events of Fig. 1(h) with f J (1710), the optimum mass is 1690 MeV but the width required is \u2264 40 MeV and optimises at 25 MeV. This width is so much less than the PDG value for f J (1710) that we have no confidence in the presence of an additional f J (1710). An upper limit (90% confidence level) on its branching ratio at all momenta is 4%.",
