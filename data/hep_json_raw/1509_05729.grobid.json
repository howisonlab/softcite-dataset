The flux-integrated differential cross sections in electron production angle, electron energy and Q 2 are presented. The ratio of the quasielastic, flux-integrated differential cross section in Q 2 for \u03bde with that of similarly-selected \u03bd\u00b5-induced events from the same exposure is used to probe assumptions that underpin conventional treatments of charged-current \u03bde interactions used by long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments. The data are found to be consistent with lepton universality and are well-described by the predictions of the neutrino event generator GENIE.",

These experiments (such as NOvA [1], T2K [2], and DUNE[3]) consist of large detectors of heavy nuclei (e.g., carbon, oxygen, argon) to maximize the rate of neutrino interactions. They examine the energy distribution of interacting neutrinos and compare the observed spectrum with the predictions based on different oscillation hypotheses. Correct prediction of the observed energy spectrum for \u03bd e interactions requires an accurate model of the interaction rates, particle content, multiplicity and outgoing particle kinematics. In other words, there is a need for precise \u03bd e cross sections on the appropriate detector materials.",

Gargamelle [4] and T2K [5] have published \u03bd e inclusive cross-section measurements at these energies, but small statistics and the inclusive nature of both of these measurements limit their usefulness for model comparisons and as a basis for tuning simulations. Therefore, most simulations, such as those used in oscillation experiments, begin by tuning to high-precision \u03bd \u00b5 (\u03bd \u00b5 ) cross section data and apply corrections such as those discussed in Ref. [6] to obtain a prediction for the \u03bd e (\u03bd e ) cross section.",

            "text": "This paper reports measurements of \u03bd e and \u03bd e charged-current quasielastic (CCQE) interactions (\u03bd e n \u2192 e \u2212 p and \u03bd e p \u2192 e + n) on nucleons in a hydrocarbon target at an average \u03bd e energy of 3.6 GeV. Quasielastic scattering is a twobody process that is of particular importance in neutrino physics since it is the dominant reaction near 1 GeV, which is a critical energy region for accelerator-based long-baseline oscillation experiments. Though the incoming neutrino has an unknown energy and the final state nucleon may not be detected, knowledge of the incoming neutrino direction and the outgoing lepton momentum vector, along with the assumption that the initial state nucleon is at rest, are sufficient to constrain the kinematics. Thus the assumption that quasielastic scattering takes place on free, stationary nucleons is often used to extract an estimate of the neutrino energy and the square of the four-momentum transferred to the nucleus (E QE \u03bd and Q 2 QE , respectively). However, hadrons exiting the nucleus after the interaction can reinteract and change identity or eject other hadrons [7], and the complex interactions within the initial nuclear environment can deform the inferred kinematics or cause multiple nucleons to be ejected by a single interaction [8,9]. Thus, true quasielastic events cannot be reliably isolated experimentally. As an alternative, this analysis defines \"CCQE-like\" events to be the signal. These are events having a prompt electron or positron from the primary vertex plus any number of nucleons, but devoid of any other hadrons or associated gamma conversions. Both \u03bd e and \u03bd e -induced CCQE-like events are included since the final-state e \u00b1 cannot be distinguished in MINERvA's unmagnetized tracking volume. The \u03bd e have a significantly smaller flux and cross section relative to the \u03bd e , though there is a small analysis selection bias favoring \u03bd e over \u03bd e . According to simulation the \u03bd e -induced events comprise 8.9% of the selected sample of \u03bd e and \u03bd e interactions. In this paper, the \u03bd e (positron) content is included when referring to the signal.",

These measurements are useful for neutrino oscillation experiments seeking to quantify their understanding of the expected \u03bd e energy distribution.

For the data used in this analysis, the horns focused positive mesons, resulting in a beam enriched in neutrinos with a most probable neutrino energy of 3.1 GeV.

Hadronic interactions not constrained by the external hadron production measurements are predicted using the FTFP hadron shower model [22]. The uncertainty on the prediction of the neutrino flux depends upon the precision in these hadron production measurements, uncertainties in the beam line focusing system and alignment [23], and comparisons between different hadron production models in regions not covered by the external data. Recently, an in situ MINERvA measurement of purely leptonic \u03bd \u2212 e elastic scattering from atomic electrons [24] became available and can be used to provide a data-based constraint for the flux estimate by comparing the precisely predicted rate for this process with what is observed. The calculated \u03bd e + \u03bd e flux for the analysis in this Letter, which includes the application of the \u03bd \u2212 e constraint, is shown in Fig. 1. The MINERvA detector consists of a core of scintillator strips surrounded by electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters on the sides and downstream end of the detector. The target and tracking region for this analysis is 95% CH and 5% other materials by weight. The triangular 3.4 \u00d7 1.7 cm 2 strips are approximately perpendicular to the beam axis and are arranged in hexagonal planes of three orientations, enabling stereoscopic reconstruction of the neutrino interaction vertex and outgoing charged tracks. The downstream electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) is identical to the tracking region except for the addition of a 0.2-cm (0.35 radiation lengths) lead sheet in front of every two planes of scintillator.",

The energy depositions in the scintillator strips (hits) are first grouped in time and then spatially grouped into clusters of energy in each scintillator plane. Clusters with energy > 1 MeV are matched among the three views to create tracks. The hits in each scintillator strip are recorded with 3.0-ns timing resolution, allowing separation of multiple interactions within a single beam spill. Candidate events are created from tracks whose most upstream energy deposition is in the fiducial volume and which do not exit the back of the detector, as such highly penetrating tracks are overwhelmingly muons. All tracks passing the criteria above are tested as e \u00b1 candidates. Hits within a 7.5 \u2022 cone (of minimum radius 50 mm) with an apex at the event vertex and a symmetry axis along the track direction are considered. Hits are associated with the cone as it extends through the scintillator tracker and ECAL; the collection of hits ceases when a gap of three radiation lengths is encountered that is devoid of hits. The hits in this cone 'object' are examined using a multivariate particle identification (PID) algorithm. This technique combines details of the energy deposition pattern both longitudinally (mean dE/dx and the fraction of energy at the downstream end of cone) and transverse to the axis of the cone (mean shower width) using a k-nearest-neighbors (kNN) algorithm [31]. For those candidate events deemed consistent with an electromagnetic cascade, electrons and positrons are separated from photons by demanding the energy deposition near the upstream end of the cone be consistent with a single track rather than the two particles expected from photon conversion to e + e \u2212 . The discriminant used for this separation is the minimum energy in a sliding 100-mm window along the axis of the cone, in 20 mm steps, from the event origin up to 500 mm (about 1.2 radiation lengths). This technique reduces the possibility of bias introduced by nuclear activity near the interaction point [32]. Cone objects surviving to this point are considered to be electron (or positron) candidates.",

The other sideband, dominated by \u03bd e CC inelastic events, consists of events with Michel electron candidates (where the Michel electron was typically produced via the decay chain of a charged pion). The normalizations of the \u03bd e inelastic and incoherent \u03c0 0 backgrounds are varied in order to find the best overall fit of simulation to the data in the reconstructed electron angle and reconstructed electron energy distributions in each sideband sample. Since, according to the simulation, the sideband in \u03a8 contains some signal events, the procedure is iterative. The background scale fit is done and the signal is extracted and used as a constraint for a new background scale fit. This is done until the background scale factors stabilize (two iterations). After this procedure, the fitted scale factor for the normalization for the \u03bd e inelastic category is found to be 0.89 \u00b1 0.08, while that for the incoherent \u03c0 0 processes is 1.06 \u00b1 0.12. The neutral-current coherent pion production is scaled down by a factor of two for pions with energies below 450 MeV in the simulation to bring the GENIE charged-current coherent charged pion production into agreement with a recent MINERvA measurement [33].

The errors on the flux are determined as discussed earlier. At the focusing peak, i.e., those neutrinos most relevant for this analysis, the \u03bd e flux arises from muons from pion decays. The errors in the primary neutrino interaction model are evaluated via the reweighting of events by varying the underlying model tuning parameters according to their uncertainties. The parameters varied in this way include the shape and normalization for elastic and resonance productions, nuclear model parameters principally affecting the deep inelastic scattering, and parameters which control the strength and behavior of the final state interactions. Contributions to the detector response systematic error were determined by varying the energy scale for electromagnetic interactions, the parameter used in Birks' Law, the PMT cross-talk fraction, the Michel electron reconstruction energy scale, and the detector mass. The largest systematic errors contributing to the cross section results presented here are due to the detector response, interaction model and the flux model, with each contributing a fractional uncertainty of less than 10%.
