The analysis has been performed for two different \u03b7 final states, i.e. \u03b7 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 and \u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 . A kinematic fit has been performed imposing the four momentum conservation, the photon velocity and the invariant masses of both \u03b7 and \u03c0 0 . The \u03b7\u03c0 0 invariant mass distribution has been fitted with the \"no-structure\" [2] and the \"kaon loop\" [3] models after background subtraction. The results of the fit are shown in table 1. It is interesting to note that both models give a large coupling of the a 0 (980) with the \u03c6 meson, indicating a sizable strange quark content in the a 0 (980).
