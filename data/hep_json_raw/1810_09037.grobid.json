            "text": "The historic discovery of a Higgs boson in 2012 by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations [1,2] at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has opened a new era in particle physics. Subsequent measurements of the properties of the new particle have indicated compatibility with the Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson [3][4][5][6][7][8][9]. While the SM has been remarkably successful in describing experimental phenomena, it is important to recognize that it is not a complete theory. In particular, it does not predict the parameters in the Higgs potential, such as the Higgs boson mass. The vast difference between the Planck scale and the weak scale remains a major mystery. There is not a complete understanding of the nature of electroweak phase transition. The discovery of a spin zero Higgs boson, the first elementary particle of its kind, only sharpens these questions. It is clear that any attempt of addressing these questions will involve new physics beyond the SM (BSM). Therefore, the Higgs boson discovery marks the beginning of a new era of theoretical and experimental explorations.",

The size of the proportionality constant c depends on the model, but it should not be much larger than . The high-luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) will measure the Higgs boson couplings to about 5% [10,11]. At the same time, the LHC will directly search for new physics from a few hundreds of GeV to at least one TeV. Eq. (1) implies that probing new physics significantly beyond the LHC reach would require the measurements of the Higgs boson couplings at least at percent level accuracy. To achieve such precision will need new facilities, a lepton collider operating as a Higgs factory is a natural next step. e + e \u2212 The Circular Electron-Positron Collider (CEPC) [12], proposed by the Chinese particle physics community, is one of such possible facilities. The CEPC will be placed in a tunnel with a circumference of approximately 100 km and will operate at a center-of-mass energy of GeV, near the maximum of the Higgs boson production cross section through the process. At the CEPC, in contrast to the LHC, Higgs boson candidates can be identified through a technique known as the recoil mass method without tagging its decays. Therefore, the Higgs boson production can be disentangled from its decay in a model independent way. Moreover, the cleaner environment at a lepton collider allows much better exclusive measurements of Higgs boson decay channels. All of these give the CEPC an impressive reach in probing Higgs boson properties. With the expected integrated luminosity of , over one million Higgs bosons will be produced. With this sample, the CEPC will be able to measure the Higgs boson coupling to the Z boson with an accuracy of 0.25%, more than a factor of 10 better than the HL-LHC [10,11]. Such a precise measurement gives the CEPC unprecedented reach into interesting new physics scenarios which are difficult to probe at the LHC. The CEPC also has strong capability in detecting Higgs boson invisible decay. It is sensitive to the invisible decay branching ratio down to 0.3%. In addition, it is expected to have good sensitivities to exotic decay channels which are swamped by backgrounds at the LHC. It is also important to stress that an Higgs factory can perform model independent measurement of the Higgs boson width. This unique feature in turn allows for the model independent determination of the Higgs boson couplings.",

Therefore CEPC detectors must be able to reconstruct and identify all key physics objects that the Higgs bosons are produced with or decay into with high efficiency, purity and accuracy. These objects include charged leptons, photons, jets, missing energy and missing momentum. Moreover, the flavor tagging of jets, such as those from b, c and light quarks or gluons, are crucial for identifying the hadronic decays of the Higgs bosons. The detector requirements for the electroweak and flavor physics are similar. One notable additional requirement is the identification of charged particles such as and for the flavor physics program. Using the International Large Detector (ILD) [13,14] as a reference, a particle flow oriented conceptual detector design, CEPC-v1 (see Fig. 1), has been developed for the CEPC. A detailed description of the CEPC-v1 detector can be found in Ref. [15]. Originally developed for the LEP experiments [16,17], particle flow is a proven concept for event reconstruction [18][19][20][21], based on the principle of reconstructing all visible final-state particles in the most sensitive detector subsystem. Specifically, a particle-flow algorithm reconstructs charged particles in the tracking system, measures photons in the electromagnetic calorimeter and neutral hadrons in both electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters. Physics objects are then identified or reconstructed from this list of final state particles. Particle flow reconstruction provides a coherent interpretation of an entire physics event and, therefore, is particularly well suited for the identification of composite physics objects such as the leptons and jets.",

The large statistics, welldefined event kinematics and clean collision environment will enable the CEPC to measure the Higgs boson production cross sections as well as its properties (mass, decay width and branching ratios, etc.) with precision far beyond those achievable at the LHC. In contrast to hadron collisions, collisions are unaffected by underlying events and pile-up effects. Theoretical calculations are less dependent on higher order QCD radiative corrections. Therefore, more precise tests of theoretical predictions can be performed at the CEPC. The tagging of events using the recoil mass method (see Section 4), independent of the Higgs boson decay, is unique to lepton colliders. It provides a powerful tool to perform model-independent measurements of the inclusive production cross section, , and of the Higgs boson decay branching ratios.

It has a direct connection with the observables shown in Table 11 and does cover many possible modifications of the couplings. However, the -framework has its limitations as well. Strictly speaking, it should not be understood as the modification of the SM renormalizable couplings by a multiplicative factor. For instance, some of such modifications violate gauge invariance. Higher order corrections in the -framework cannot be easily defined. Moreover, the parameters do not include all possible effects of new physics either. For example, apart from the overall size, potential new physics can also introduce form factors which can change the kinematics of particles that couple to a particular vertex. Manifestations of this effect can be seen in the EFT analysis. It is useful to compare with the EFT analysis discussed in the next subsection. The EFT relates and , and further expands them into three different Lorentz structures. Moreover, some of these higher dimensional couplings are The LHC and especially the HL-LHC will provide valuable and complementary information about the Higgs boson properties. For example, the LHC is capable of directly measuring the process [80,81]. It can also use differential cross sections to differentiate contributions between the top-quark and other heavy particle states in the loop of the Hgg vertex [82][83][84][85]. Moreover, it can separate contributions from different operators in the couplings between the Higgs and vector bosons [86]. For the purpose of the coupling fit in the -framework, the LHC, with its large statistics, improves the precision of rare processes such as . Note that a large portion of the systematic uncertainties intrinsic to a hadron collider can be canceled by taking ratios of measured cross sections. For example, combining the ratio of the rates of and at the LHC and the measurement of the HZZ coupling at the CEPC can significantly improve the precision. These are the most useful inputs from the LHC to combine with the CEPC. Similar studies of combination with the LHC for the ILC can be found in Refs. [49,50,72,87,88].",

To obtain robust constraints on the Wilson coefficients, , a global analysis is required, which includes contributions from all possible dimension-six operators. While a large number of dimensionsix operators can be written down, only a subset of them contribute to the Higgs boson processes at the leading order. Among these operators, some are much better constrained by other measurements. It is thus reasonable to focus on the operator that primarily contribute to the Higgs boson processes and therefore reduce the parameter space by making appropriate assumptions, as done in the recent studies for future lepton colliders [68,[70][71][72][73][74][75]. Following these studies, the CP-violating operators as well as the ones that induce fermion dipole interactions are discarded. At the leading order, CP-violating operators do not have linear contributions to the rates of the Higgs boson processes. While they do contribute to angular observables at the leading order [66,67], these operators are usually much better constrained by the Electric Dipole Moment (EDM) experiments [95][96][97], though some parameter space is still available for the CP-violating couplings of the Higgs boson to heavy flavor quarks and leptons [98,99]. The interference between the fermion dipole interactions with SM terms are suppressed by the fermion masses. The corresponding operators also generate dipole moments, which are stringently constrained, especially for light fermions. For the operators that modify the Yukawa coupling matrices, only the five diagonal ones that correspond to the top, charm, bottom, tau, and muon Yukawa couplings are considered, which are relevant for the Higgs boson measurements at the CEPC.",

In comparison with the -framework, a significant advantage of the EFT is that it gives physical parametrization of potential new physics effects. EFT operators can be used directly in computations. The EFT framework also allow for a natural inclusion of new observables, with possible correlations automatically taken into account. At the same time, the connections with experimental observables are less direct and intuitive. Sometimes, the EFT approach is referred to as model-independent. This is only accurate to a certain extent. It assumes that there are no new light degrees of freedom. In practice, assumptions are often made to simplify the set of EFT operators, as also done here.",

The W mass can also be measured with a precision of a few MeVs at the CEPC even without a dedicated WW threshold run. Given that the expected precision of the Z-pole observables and the W mass are much higher than the ones of Higgs boson observables, it is assumed that the former ones are perfectly constrained, which significantly simplifies the analysis. In particular, in a convenient basis all the contact interaction terms of the form can be discarded since they also modify the fermion gauge couplings. Realistic Z-pole constraints have also been considered in recent studies [72,73,75], but certain assumptions (such as flavor-universality) and simplifications are made. Future studies with more general frameworks are desired to fully determine the impact of the Z-pole measurements on the Higgs boson analysis. The measurements of the triple gauge couplings (TGCs) from the diboson process play an important role in the Higgs boson coupling analysis under the EFT framework. Focusing on CP-even dimension-six operators, the modifications to the triple gauge vertices from new physics can be parametrized by three anomalous TGC parameters (aTGCs), conventionally denoted as , and [100,101]. Among them, and are generated by operators that also contribute to the Higgs boson processes. At 240 GeV, the process cross section is almost two orders of magnitude larger than that of the process. The measurements of the diboson process thus provide strong constraints on the operators that generate the aTGCs. A dedicated study on the TGC measurements at the CEPC is not currently available. A simplified analysis is thus performed to estimate the aTGC sensitivity. The results are shown in Table 13. The analysis roughly follows the methods in Refs. [71,102]. Only the WW events in the semi-leptonic (electron or muon) channel are used, which are easier to reconstruct and have a sizable branching ratio (29%). In particular, the production polar angle, as well as the two decay angles of the leptonically decaying W boson, can be fully reconstructed, which contain important information on the aTGCs. The two decay angles of the hadronically decaying W boson can only be reconstructed with a two-fold ambiguity. A fit of the three aTGC parameters to the binned distribution of all five angles is performed, from which the one-sigma interval for each of the three aTGCs as well as the correlations among them are extracted. A signal selection efficiency of 80% is assumed. The effects of systematic uncertainties and backgrounds are not considered, assuming they are under control after the selection cuts.",

While all non-redundant bases are equivalent, it is particularly convenient to choose a basis in which the twelve degrees of freedom can be mapped to exactly twelve operators, whereas the rest are removed by the assumptions. Two such bases are considered in this analysis. The first is defined by the set of dimension-six operators in Table 14. Among them, corresponds to the aT-GC parameter , and generate the aTGC parameters and as well as Higgs boson anomalous couplings, while the rest operators can only be probed by the Higgs boson measurements at the leading order. The second basis is the so-called \"Higgs basis, \" proposed in Ref. [103]. In the Higgs basis, the parameters are defined in terms of the mass eigenstates after the electroweak symmetry breaking, and can be directly interpreted as the size of the Higgs boson couplings. Different from the original Higgs basis, this analysis follows Ref. [71], with the parameters associated with the Hgg, and vertices normalized to the SM one-loop contributions, and denoted as , and (as opposed to , and in Ref. [103]). The parameter is further defined to absorb all contributions to the Hgg vertex. With these redefinitions, the set of twelve parameters is given by",

For the parameters , and , the clean signal and small branching ratios of the corresponding channels ( ) makes the HL-LHC precision comparable to the CEPC. The combination with the LHC measurements thus provides non-negligible improvements, especially for those parameters. It should be noted that, while modifies the Hgg vertex via the top-quark loop contribution, the CEPC alone cannot discriminate it from the Hgg contact interaction obtained from integrating out a heavy new particle in the loop. The parameter absorbs both contributions and reflects the overall precision of the Hgg coupling. The combination with the LHC measurements can resolve this flat direction. The CEPC measurements, in turn, can improve the constraint on set by the LHC by providing much better constraints on the other parameters that contribute to the process. It should also be noted that the measurement of the charm Yukawa coupling is not reported in Ref. [10], while the projection of its constraint has a large variation among \u03b4y c \u03b4y c \u03b4y c different studies and can be much larger than one [113][114][115][116][117][118]. Therefore, is fixed to be zero for the LHC-only fits, as treating as an unconstrained free parameter generates a flat direction in the fit which makes the overall sensitivity much worse.

While the individual sensitivity to some of the operators at the LHC can be comparable to the CEPC (e.g., and from the measurement of ), the CEPC sensitivity is much more robust under a global framework. This is due to its comprehensive measurements of both the inclusive ZH cross section and the exclusive rates of many Higgs boson decay channels. Operators and both contribute to the Hgg vertex. While the CEPC can provide strong constraints on either of them if the other is set to zero, they can only be constrained in a global fit if the measurements at the LHC are also included. It is also important to note that the validity of EFT can be a potential issue for the LHC measurements [110].

One can nevertheless treat the Higgs boson total width as a free parameter in the EFT global fit and obtain an indirect constraint of it, as done in Ref. [72]. With this treatment, the CEPC can constrain the Higgs boson width to a precision of 1.7% (1.6% if combined with the HL-LHC).

The improvement is mainly because the and HZZ couplings are treated as being independent in the 10-parameter coupling fit, while in the EFT framework they are related to each other under gauge invariance and custodial symmetry. It should also be noted that the Higgs boson width determined using Eqs. (5) and (9) explicitly assumes that the and HZZ couplings are independent of the energy scale.

For more detailed discussion on a complete set of Higgs boson and Top quark operators, see Ref. [124]. The dominant sources of constraints are from and for , and and for . Given that measurements are sensitive to both operators, a joint analysis of and will yield a significantly different result comparing to individual operator analysis. A joint analysis for these two operators in terms of Yukawa coupling strengths and the associated CP phases is performed at the CEPC. The important physics cases for such considerations are highlighted. Constraints on the top-quark and bottom-quark Yukawa couplings, including their CP phases, are presented, respectively, in the left and right panels of Fig. 24, respectively. The 68% and 95% CL exclusion bands are shown in dashed and solid lines. The limits for the CEPC are shown in bright black and magenta lines for individual operator analysis and the bright green and yellow shaded regions representing the allowed parameter space at 68% and 95% CL, respectively. The dimmed thick black curves represent the results after turning on both operators and at the same time, using a profilelikelihood method profiling over other parameters. Furthermore, in the left panel the cyan band represents constraints from the HL-LHC measurements, red bands are constraints from the CEPC measurements and blue bands are constraints from the CEPC measurements. Similarly, in the right panel, the cyan bands are constraints from and the red bands are constraints from at the CEPC. The left panel of Fig. 24 shows that the expected sensitivity on the modification in the magnitude of topquark Yukawa coupling is around \u00b13% for the single operator analysis. This is relaxed to [-9.5%, +3%] assuming zero CP phase for the top-quark Yukawa coupling and allowing the bottom-quark Yukawa coupling and its phase to vary freely. The phase of the top-quark Yukawa coup-  ling can be constrained to . This constraint is driven by the measurement, where a sizable phase shift will enlarge the decay rate via reducing the interference with the SM W boson loop. The constraint on the magnitude of the top-quark Yukawa coupling is driven by the measurement which is dominated by the top-quark loop contribution. Note that constraints from the measurement are not constant with respect to the Yukawa coupling magnitude. This is due to the different sizes of the top-quark loop contribution to Hgg through scalar and pseudoscalar couplings. Similarly, as shown in the right panel of Fig. 24 for the bottom-quark Yukawa coupling, the constraint for the magnitude is \u00b12.5%. For the CP phase, the constraint changes from to zero when the top-quark Yukawa coupling is left free.",

Two of the anomalous HZZ coupling measurements are of particular interest at the CEPC: the fraction of the high-order CP-even contribution due to either SM contribution or new physics, , and the fraction of a CP-odd contribution due to new physics, . The following two types of observables can be used to measure these anomalous couplings of the Higgs bosons. is different for different CP property of the Higgs boson [133].

For instance, if the new physics is the quantum gravity scale, GeV, then an immediate question is how to explain the 17 orders of magnitude difference between it and the electroweak scale.

A particularly interesting possibility is that the topquark partner is a SM singlet. In such scenarios, it is very difficult to search for the top-quark partner at the LHC. It is nontrivial to construct models with SM-singlet topquark partners that resolve the fine-tuning problem of the electroweak scale [142,143]. Nevertheless, they offer an extreme example that new physics with a scale of a few hundred GeVs could still be alive after the current and future LHC runs. However, as mentioned earlier, any model that addresses the electroweak naturalness problem would inevitably contain sizable couplings to the Higgs boson. The Higgs boson coupling measurements at the CEPC thus offer an ideal way of testing this type of models, which is very important for making robust arguments on the naturalness problem. As an example, we consider a scalar top-quark partner with its only interaction to the SM fields given by [65,144]. This interaction contributes to the Higgs propagator at one-loop level, and induces a universal shift to all Higgs boson couplings. The precise measurement of the inclusive ZH cross section imposes a strong constraint on and provides the best constraint on the mass of the top-quark partner, . As we can see from the left panel of Fig. 31, the CEPC will be able to probe up to around 700 GeV, giving an non-trivial test of naturalness even in this very difficult scenario. A more concrete model is the so-called \"folded SUSY\" [143], in which the top-quark partners are scalars analogous to the stops in SUSY. The projected constraints in the folded stop mass plane is shown on in the right panel of Fig. 31, which are at least around 350 GeV for both stops.",

New physics with sizable couplings to the Higgs boson are needed to make the phase transition a first order one. The measurement of the triple Higgs boson coupling offers an ideal testing ground for these new physics models. Being the third derivative, it carries more information about the global shape of the Higgs potential than the mass. It can also be determined to a reasonable precision at the future colliders, unlike the quartic Higgs boson coupling. Indeed, most models with first order electroweak phase transition predict a triple Higgs boson coupling with large deviations from the SM prediction. This is demonstrated with a simple example in Fig. 33, which shows the deviation in the triple Higgs boson coupling for a generic singlet model. For the model points that produces a first order phase transition, the value of triple Higgs boson coupling indeed covers a wide range and can be different from the SM prediction by up to 100%. The CEPC could probe the triple Higgs boson coupling via its loop contributions to single Higgs boson processes. As pointed out in Section 7.3, it will have a lim-ited reach to the most general scenario in which all Higgs boson couplings are allowed to deviate from their SM values. An additional run at 350 GeV will help to improve the sensitivity, while a direct measurement using di-Higgs production would have to wait for a future proton-proton collider, or a lepton collider running at much higher energies. However, it should be noted that the model independent approach in Section 7.3 makes no assumption on any possible connection between the triple Higgs boson coupling and other couplings. In practice, to induce large deviation in triple Higgs boson coupling requires the new physics to be close to the weak scale, while the presence of such new physics will most likely induce deviations in other Higgs boson couplings as well, such as the couplings to the electroweak gauge bosons. Without some symmetry or fine tuning, both deviations are expected to come in at the order of . Such deviations can be probed very well at lepton colliders.",

At the same time, it will also generate the operator . This leads to a wave function renormalization, which gives rises to universal shift of the Higgs boson couplings. In particular, the modification of the HZZ coupling is also of order . We thus expect , which is constrained within 0.25% even with the inclusive ZH measurement alone, to provide the best constraining power on this model. This is explicitly verified with a scan in the model parameter space, shown in Fig.35. The model points with a first order phase transition are projected on the plane of the HZZ and triple Higgs boson couplings. Indeed, for model points with a large deviation in the triple Higgs boson coupling, a sizable deviation in the HZZ coupling is also present. In this model, constraining power of the HZZ coupling measurement at CEPC is almost the same as the triple Higgs boson coupling measurement at a future 100 TeV hadron collider. A more detailed view of the parameter space of the real singlet model is presented in Fig.36. In addition to the deviations in at CEPC, the sensitivities of the current and future electroweak precision tests are also presented [152]. The measurement, with a projected precision of 0.5%, indeed provides the best sensitivity in this scenario. We thus conclude that CEPC has an excellent coverage in the full model space that gives a first order electroweak phase transition. symmetry is imposed on the singlet, has also been considered [147,151]. It is significantly more difficult to achieve a first order electroweak phase transition in this scenario, since the singlet could only modify the Higgs potential at loop levels. To produce the same level of deviation in the Higgs potential, a much stronger coupling between the Higgs boson and the singlet is required, which often exceeds the limits imposed by the requirement of perturbativity. For the same reason, the expected loop induced deviation in the triple Higgs boson coupling is also generically smaller in this case, and is about 10%-15%, as shown in Fig. 37(a). Even in this difficult case, we see in Fig. 37(b) that the expected deviation of the cross section is about 0.6%. Therefore, the CEPC will see the first evidence of new physics even in this very difficult case. In the more general classes of models, the new physics which modifies the Higgs boson coupling could carry other SM gauge quantum numbers, such as electric charge and/or color. In such cases, there will be significant modifications to the Hgg and couplings. One such example is shown in Fig. 37(c), with a 6% deviation in the coupling expected in order to obtain a first order phase transition. As shown in Table  12, the combination of CEPC and HL-LHC measurements could constrain to a precision of 1.7%, and would test this scenario with a sensitivity of more than three standard deviations.",
