The existence of exotic states beyond those of conventional mesons and baryons was debated for decades, mostly because no convincing experimental evidence for them had been found [1]. In recent years, the discovery of charged Z c charmonium-like states [2,3], which decay to a charmonium state plus a pion or a pair of charmed mesons and, therefore, must consist of at least a four constituent quark configuration ccqq \u2032 , has stirred excitement about these possible exotic states. In e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 \u2213 Z \u00b1 c processes, four Z \u00b1 c states have been discovered in the decays of Z c (3885) \u00b1 \u2192 (DD * ) \u00b1 [4,5], [9] and Z c (4025) \u00b1 \u2192 (D * D * ) \u00b1 [10]. There have been many theoretical predictions and interpretations [3] to explain their nature as exotic mesons. However, none of these models have either been ruled out or established experimentally.",

To reduce backgrounds and to improve the resolution, a KF with two degrees of freedom (2C) is performed, constraining M (\u03b3\u03b3) to the nominal \u03c0 0 mass m(\u03c0 0 ) and the recoil mass of \u03c0 0 DD, RM (\u03c0 0 DD), to the nominal \u03c0 mass.

To assess the uncertainty of the signal shape, an Swave relativistic Breit-Wigner function with constant width [28] is taken as an alternative signal model in the simultaneous fit. The changes of the fitted mass and width are determined to be 3. Maximum fluctuations due to changing the fit range are assigned as systematic uncertainties. The MC simulation of the mass shift and resolution may not fully reflect the effects in data, and it is studied by fitting theD * peak in the RM (D\u03c0 0 ) spectra to obtain the mass shift and the resolution difference between data and MC. The obtained mass shift is quoted as part of the systematic uncertainties of the mass. The variations of the fit results after considering the resolution difference is assigned as systematic uncertainty. Efficiency-related systematic uncertainties are universal in each D decay mode and include six sources: tracking efficiency, particle identification, photon detection efficiency, \u03c0 0 reconstruction efficiency, K S reconstruction efficiency and KF efficiency. The uncertainties of tracking efficiency and particle identification for \u03c0 \u00b1 and K \u00b1 are evaluated to be 1% per track [29,30]. The uncertainty in the photon-reconstruction efficiency is estimated to be about 1% per photon [31]. The efficiency difference of reconstructing the K S in MC simulations and in data is 4.0% [32]. The uncertainty in \u03c0 0 reconstruction is 1% [31]. The systematic bias of the KF is estimated by using the track-parametercorrection method [33]. The correction factors for helix track parameters are determined from the control sample e + e \u2212 \u2192 K * (892) 0 K + \u03c0 \u2212 \u2192 K + K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 . The total efficiency-related systematic uncertainty is taken as the square root of the quadratic sum of the individual uncertainties. The potential bias from the event selection and the analysis procedure studied with input-output checks, which compare the output results with the input values of the resonance mass and width based on MC simulations. We assign the systematic uncertainty of 1.6 MeV/c 2 in mass and 2.5 MeV in width accordingly. The systematic uncertainty of the radiative correction factor 1 + \u03b4 rad , which includes the effect on the detection efficiency, is estimated to be 5% by changing the input (DD * ) 0 \u03c0 0 line shape within errors [4]. The systematic uncertainty of the vacuum polarization factor 1 + \u03b4 vac is 0.5% taken from QED calculation [27]. The weighted systematic uncertainty of B int is from the world average value [1]. The uncertainty of integrated luminosity is taken as 1% by measuring Bhabha events [14]. The uncertainty of the mass window requirement is negligible. The overall systematic uncertainties are determined by combining all the sources in quadrature, assuming they are independent.",
