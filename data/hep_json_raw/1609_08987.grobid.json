            "text": "We propose a new experiment to measure the running of the electromagnetic coupling constant in the spacelike region by scattering high-energy muons on atomic electrons of a low-Z target through the elastic process \u03bc e \u2192 \u03bc e. The differential cross section of this process, measured as a function of the squared momentum transfer t = q 2 < 0, provides direct sensitivity to the leading-order hadronic contribution to the muon anomaly a HLO \u03bc . By using a muon beam of 150 GeV, with an average rate of \u223c1.3 \u00d710 7 muon/s, currently available at the CERN North Area, a statistical uncertainty of \u223c0.3% can be achieved on a HLO \u03bc after two years of data taking. The direct measurement of a HLO \u03bc via \u03bce scattering will provide an independent determination, competitive with the time-like dispersive approach, and consolidate the theoretical prediction for the muon g-2 in the Standard Model. It will allow therefore a firmer interpretation of the measurements of the future muon g-2 experiments at Fermilab and J-PARC.",

            "text": "In searching for new physics, low-energy high-precision measurements are complementary to the LHC high-energy frontier. The long-standing (3)(4)\u03c3 discrepancy between the experimental value of the muon anomalous magnetic moment a \u03bc = (g \u2212 2)/2 and the Standard Model (SM) prediction, a \u03bc (Exp \u2212 SM) \u223c (28 \u00b1 8) \u00d7 10 \u221210 [1,2], has been considered during these years as one of the most intriguing indications of physics beyond the SM. However, the accuracy of the SM prediction, 5 \u00d7 10 \u221210 , is limited by strong interaction effects, which cannot be computed perturbatively at low energies. Long time ago, by using analyticity and unitarity, it was shown [3][4][5] that the leading-order (LO) hadronic contribution to the muon g-2, a HLO \u03bc , could be computed via a dispersion integral of the hadron production cross section in e + e \u2212 annihilation at low-energy. The present error on a HLO \u03bc , \u223c 4 \u00d7 10 \u221210 , with a fractional accuracy of 0.6%, constitutes the main uncertainty of the SM prediction. An alternative evaluation of a HLO \u03bc can be obtained by lattice QCD calculations [6][7][8][9][10][11]. Even if current lattice QCD results are not yet competitive with those obtained with the dispersive approach via time-like data, their errors are expected to decrease significantly in the next few years [12,13]. The O(\u03b1 3 ) hadronic light-by-light contribution, a HLbL \u03bc , which has the second largest error in the theoretical evaluation, contributing with an uncertainty of (2.5-4) \u00d710 \u221210 , cannot at present be determined from data and its calculation relies on the use of specific models [14][15][16][17][18]. . DHMZ is Ref. [22], HLMNT is Ref. [23]; SMXX [24] is the average of the two previous values with a reduced error as expected by the improvement on the hadronic cross section measurement; BNL-E821 04 ave. is the current experimental value of a \u03bc ; New (g-2) exp. is the same central value with a fourfold improved precision, as planned by the future g-2 experiments at Fermilab and J-PARC [1] From the experimental side, the error achieved by the BNL E821 experiment, \u03b4a Exp \u03bc = 6.3 \u00d7 10 \u221210 (corresponding to 0.54 ppm) [19], is dominated by the available statistics. New experiments at Fermilab and J-PARC, aiming at measuring the muon g-2 to a precision of 1.6 \u00d7 10 \u221210 (0.14 ppm), are in preparation [20,21]. Figure 1, from Ref. [1], shows the status of the g-2 discrepancy compared with what could be expected after the new g-2 measurements at Fermilab and J-PARC, assuming that the central value would remain the same. Together with a fourfold improved precision on the experimental side, an improvement on the LO hadronic contribution is highly desirable. Differently from the dispersive approach, which relies on time-like data from annihilation cross sections, our proposal is to determine a HLO \u03bc from a measurement of the effective electromagnetic coupling in the space-like region, where the vacuum polarization is a smooth function of the squared momentum transfer. This method has been recently proposed [25] by using Bhabha scattering data. A method to determine the running of \u03b1 by using small-angle Bhabha scattering was proposed in [26] and applied to LEP data in [27]. The hadronic contribution to the running of \u03b1 can also be determined unambiguously through the t-channel \u03bce elastic scattering process, from which a HLO \u03bc could be obtained, as detailed in this paper.",

Taking into account the process cross section and the above value for the integrated luminosity, with a simplified simulation of the experiment we estimate that one can reach a statistical sensitivity of roughly 0.3% on the value of a HLO \u03bc . We considered 30 experimental data points in the accessible x range. The integrand in the region x \u2208 [0.93, 1], accounting for 13% of the a HLO \u03bc integral, cannot be reached by the proposed experiment, but can be determined using time-like data and perturbative QCD, and/or lattice QCD results [43][44][45]. In Fig. 4, the distribution of the events, expected with the above luminosity, is shown as a function of x (left) and of t (right), as obtained with a simulation of the lowest-order \u03bce \u2192 \u03bce cross section in 30 evenly spaced bins. As can be seen, the statistics accessible in the x peak region, corresponding to large momentum transfer t, is not a limiting factor.",

In addition, multiple scattering in general causes acoplanarity, while two-body events are planar, within the resolution. These facts allow effects to be modelled and measured using data.
