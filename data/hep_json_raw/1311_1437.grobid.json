            "text": "Hard exclusive meson leptoproduction on nucleons (HEMP) can be described in the framework of perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (pQCD). For incoming longitudinal virtual photons, collinear factorisation holds for the HEMP process amplitude [1,2]. It factorises into a hard part that is calculable in pQCD and a soft part that contains generalised parton distributions (GPDs) [3][4][5] and the meson distribution amplitude. For incoming transverse virtual photons, there exists no proof of collinear factorisation. Instead, a phenomenological pQCD-inspired model (see Ref. [6] and references therein) employing parton-transverse-momentum factorisation can be used, in which process amplitudes are constructed from GPDs. Measurements of HEMP hence allow in various ways access to GPDs and thereby to the (spin) structure of the nucleon. At leading twist, the chiral-even GPDs H f and E f are sufficient to describe HEMP on a spin 1/2 target, where f denotes a quark of a given flavor or a gluon. There exist also chiral-odd -often called transverse -GPDs, from which in particular H f T and E f T were shown to be required (see Ref. [7] and references therein) for the description of exclusive + electroproduction on a transversely polarised proton target [8]. It was recently shown [6] that the data presented in this contribution are also sensitive to these GPDs.",

The asymmetry A sin(\u2212 S ) UT itself may still be of small magnitude, because for GPDs E in 0 production the valence quark contribution is expected to be not large.
