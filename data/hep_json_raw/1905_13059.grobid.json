The search targets final states with one or zero leptons, large missing transverse momentum, and two jets with a large separation in rapidity. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 of protonproton collisions at \u221a s = 13 TeV collected in 2016 with the CMS detector at the LHC. The observed dijet invariant mass and lepton-neutrino transverse mass spectra are found to be consistent with the standard model predictions. Upper limits are set on the cross sections for chargino (\u03c7 \u00b1 1 ) and neutralino (\u03c7 0 2 ) production with two associated jets. For a compressed mass spectrum scenario in which the\u03c7 \u00b1 1 and\u03c7 0 2 decays proceed via a light slepton and the mass difference between the lightest neutralino\u03c7 0 1 and the mass-degenerate particles\u03c7 \u00b1 1 and\u03c7 0 2 is 1 (30) GeV, the most stringent lower limit to date of 112 (215) GeV is set on the mass of these latter two particles.",

However, for all of its attractive features, there is as yet no direct evidence to support this theory. The masses of the strongly produced gluinos ( g ) as well as the squarks ( q) of the first and second generations have been excluded below approximately 2 TeV in certain simplified model scenarios [8][9][10][11][12][13]. On the other hand, the values of the masses of the weakly produced charginos ( \u03c7 \u00b1 i ) and neutralinos ( \u03c7 0 i ) are less constrained at the CERN LHC where these particles have much smaller production cross sections. The chargino-neutralino sector of SUSY plays an important role in establishing a connection between SUSY models and DM. The lightest neutralino \u03c7 0 1 , as the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP), is the canonical DM candidate in R-parity conserving SUSY extensions of the SM [14].",

As the mass difference between SUSY particles decreases, the momenta available to the co-produced SM particles are small, resulting in \"soft\" decay products having low transverse momentum (p T ). Therefore, the traditional searches using DY processes suffer in the compressed spectrum scenarios since the SM particles used for discrimination become more difficult to reconstruct as their momenta decrease. In contrast, chargino and neutralino production via vector boson fusion (VBF) processes of order \u03b1 4 EW are very useful in tackling these interesting compressed SUSY scenarios [20]. In VBF processes, electroweak SUSY particles are pair-produced in association with two high-p T oppositely-directed jets close to the beam axis (forward), resulting in a large dijet invariant mass (m jj ). The use of two high-p T VBF jets in the event topology effectively suppresses the SM background while, simultaneously, creating a recoil effect that facilitates both the detection of p miss T in the event and the identification of the soft decay products in compressed-spectrum scenarios because of their natural kinematic boost [21,22].

That analysis considered SUSY models with light staus ( \u03c4 ) leading to leptonic decay modes of the charginos and neutralinos (e.g., \u03c7 0 2 \u2192 \u03c4 \u00b1 \u03c4 \u2213 \u2192 \u03c4 \u2212 \u03c4 + \u03c7 0 1 ). In the presence of a light slepton, it is likely that \u03c7 \u00b1 1 decays to \u00b1 \u03bd \u03c7 0 1 and \u03c7 0 2 decays to + \u2212 \u03c7 0 1 . Thus, charginos and neutralinos were probed using final states with two leptons and two additional jets consistent with the VBF topology. In the compressed mass spectrum scenario, where the mass difference between the \u03c7 0 1 and \u03c7 0 2 / \u03c7 \u00b1 1 particles was taken to be 50 GeV, \u03c7 0 2 and \u03c7 \u00b1 1 masses below 170 GeV were excluded. In this paper, a search is presented for the electroweak production of SUSY particles in the VBF topology using data collected in 2016 with the CMS detector and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 of proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of \u221a s = 13 TeV. Besides the two oppositely directed forward jets (j) that define the VBF configuration, the search requires the presence of zero or one soft lepton and large p miss T . The events are classified into two categories based on the lepton content, 0 jj and 1 jj, with the latter having three different final states: ejj, \u00b5jj, and \u03c4 h jj, where \u03c4 h denotes a hadronically decaying \u03c4 lepton. The 0 jj final state (also referred to as the \"invisible\" channel) provides the best sensitivity to the \u2206m < 10 GeV scenarios, where the leptons from the \u03c7 0 2 / \u03c7 \u00b1 1 decays are \"lost\", either because their momenta are too low to reconstruct or because they fail to satisfy the identification requirements.

For the ejj and \u00b5jj channels, the main backgrounds are from tt production and W boson production in association with jets (W+jets). Subdominant background sources come from single top quark, diboson (WW, WZ, and ZZ, collectively referred to as VV) and Z+jets production. For the \u03c4 h jj channel, the main source of background consists of SM events only containing jets produced via the strong interaction, referred to as quantum chromodynamics (QCD) multijet events, followed by W+jets and tt production. In the 0 jj channel, the main backgrounds are W/Z+jets and QCD multijet events, with a minor contribution from tt and diboson production. The W+jets, tt, and single top quark processes produce events with genuine leptons, p miss T , and jets. The Z+jets process contributes to the background composition when one of the leptons is lost as a result of detector acceptance or inefficiencies in the reconstruction and identification algorithms. Although jets in QCD events have a 1-5% probability of being misidentified as a \u03c4 h , the large QCD multijet production cross section results in a substantial contribution of this background to the \u03c4 h jj channel.",

The background processes involving the production of a single vector boson in association with two jets exclusively through pure electroweak interactions are simulated at LO via MadGraph5 amc@nlo. The interference effect between pure electroweak and mixed electroweak-QCD production of V+jets events has been studied and found to be small [37]. The effect is neglected in our analysis and the sum of these two samples is henceforth referred to as Z+jets. The QCD multijet background is also simulated at LO using MadGraph5 amc@nlo. Single top quark and tt processes are generated at next-to-leading order (NLO) using the powheg v2.0 generator [38][39][40][41][42]. The leading order pythia v8.212 generator is used to model the diboson processes. The powheg and MadGraph generators are interfaced with the pythia v8.212 [43] program, which is used to describe the parton shower and the hadronization and fragmentation processes with the CUETP8M1 tune [44]. The NNPDF3.0 LO and NLO [45] parton distribution functions (PDFs) are used in the event generation. Double counting of the partons generated with MadGraph5 amc@nlo and powheg interfaced with pythia is removed using the MLM [46] matching scheme. The LO cross sections are used to normalize simulated signal events, while NLO cross sections are used for simulated backgrounds [36,42,47,48].",

For this reason, events are required to have zero or exactly one well-identified soft lepton. In the \u00b5jj channel, an additional lepton veto is applied by rejecting events containing a second muon (p T > 8 GeV), an electron (p T > 10 GeV), or a \u03c4 h candidate (p T > 20 GeV). Similarly, ejj and \u03c4 h jj channel events are required not to contain another electron, muon, or \u03c4 h candidate. The 0 jj channel selects events without a well-identified electron, muon, or \u03c4 h candidate. The veto on additional leptons maintains high efficiency for compressed mass spectra scenarios and simultaneously reduces the SM backgrounds. To further suppress QCD multijet background events containing large p miss T from jet mismeasurements, the minimum azimuthal separation between any jet with p T > 30 GeV and the direction of the missing transverse momentum vector is required to be greater than 0.5 (|\u2206\u03c6 min ( p miss T , j)| > 0.5). Muon, electron, and \u03c4 h candidates must have 8 < p T < 40 GeV, 10 < p T < 40 GeV, and 20 < p T < 40 GeV, respectively. The upper bound on lepton p T suppresses the Z \u2192 and W \u2192 \u03bd backgrounds where the average p T ( ) is about m Z /2 and m W /2, respectively. The lower bound on \u03c4 h p T is larger because of known difficulties reconstructing lower-p T \u03c4 h candidates, namely that they do not produce a narrow jet in the detector, which makes them difficult to distinguish from quark or gluon jets. All leptons are required to have |\u03b7| < 2.1 in order to select high quality and well-isolated leptons within the tracker acceptance. This requirement is 99% efficient for signal events. Lepton candidates are also required to pass the reconstruction, identification, and isolation criteria described in section 3.",

The background yields predicted by the MC simulated samples are corrected for observed differences with respect to the data in the CRs, and scaled to the fraction of events passing the VBF selection, derived from data. The modeling of the m jj distribution is checked in the CRs. Two CRs are used to verify the MC simulation, estimate acceptance corrections used to scale the MC simulation yields, and measure the fraction of events passing the VBF selection.

Therefore, the average of the correction factors obtained for the ejj and \u00b5jj channels, 1.04\u00b10.13, is used to scale the W+jets prediction from simulation in the \u03c4 h jj channel. This approach is justified since the W(\u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd \u03c4 )+jets prediction from simulation is corrected to account for slight differences in the \u03c4 h identification efficiency observed in data. This is further supported by the fact that the modeling of the VBF efficiency at simulation level is uncorrelated with the decay of the W boson.

The relative systematic uncertainties on the product SF CR1 BG (central)SF CR2 BG (VBF) related to the statistical precision in the CRs range between 8 and 42%, depending on the background component and search channel.

The systematic uncertainties in the SF CR1 BG (central), SF CR2 BG (VBF), T F VBF , and T F \u2206\u03c6 factors, evaluated from the closure tests and cross-checks with data, range from 9 to 33%, depending on the channel. Additionally, although the background m T and m jj shapes between data and simulation are consistent within statistical uncertainties, data/BG ratios of the m T and m jj distributions are fit with a first-order polynomial, and the deviation of the fit from unity, as a function of m T or m jj , is conservatively taken as the systematic uncertainty on the shape. This results in up to \u224810% systematic uncertainty in a given m T or m jj bin.",

The total efficiency for the jet reconstruction and identification requirements is >98% for the entire \u03b7 and p T range, as validated through the agreement observed between data and simulation in the \u03b7 distribution of jets, in particular at high \u03b7, in CRs enriched with tt background events. Among the dominant uncertainties in the signal acceptance is the modeling of the kinematic properties of jets, and thus the efficiency to select VBF topologies for forward jets in the MadGraph simulation. This is investigated by comparing the predicted and measured m jj spectra in the Z+jets CRs. The level of agreement between the predicted and observed m jj spectra is better than 9%, which is assigned as a systematic uncertainty in the VBF efficiency for signal samples. The dominant uncertainty in the signal acceptance arises from the partial mistiming of signals in the forward region of the ECAL endcaps, which led to a reduction in the L1 trigger efficiency. A correction for this effect was determined using an unbiased data sample. This correction was found to be about 8% for m jj of 1 TeV and increases to about 19% for m jj greater than 3.5 TeV. The uncertainty in the signal acceptance from the PDF set used in simulation is evaluated in accordance with the PDF4LHC recommendations [60] by comparing the results obtained using the CTEQ6.6L, MSTW08, and NNPDF10 PDF sets [61][62][63] with those from the default PDF set.

The main difference between the two models is the branching ratio of \u03c7 \u00b1 1 and \u03c7 0 2 to leptonic final states. It should be noted that the branching fractions to leptons are adapted to off-shell W and Z bosons.   where 0 < x < 1. Results are presented for x = 0.5 in the \" -democratic\" model where three sleptons (m = m e = m \u00b5 = m \u03c4 ) are light [15]. The results are interpreted by assuming branching fractions B( \u03c7 0 2 \u2192 \u2192 \u03c7 0 1 ) = 1 and B( \u03c7 \u00b1 1 \u2192 \u03bd \u2192 \u03bd \u03c7 0 1 ) = 1. To highlight the evolution of the search sensitivity for compressed spectra with mass gap \u2206m, values between \u2206m = 1 and 50 GeV are studied for both the light slepton and WZ interpretations. The signal selection efficiency for the 1\u00b5jj (1ejj) channel in the light slepton model, assuming \u2206m = 30 GeV, is 0.9 (0.7)% for m( \u03c7 \u00b1 1 ) = 100 GeV and 2.5 (1.8)% for m( \u03c7 \u00b1 1 ) = 300 GeV. Similarly, the signal selection efficiency for the 0 jj channel, assuming \u2206m = GeV, is 2.8% for m( \u03c7 \u00b1 1 ) = 100 GeV and 5.3% for m( \u03c7 \u00b1 1 ) = 300 GeV. The calculation of the exclusion limit is obtained by using the m T (m jj ) distribution in the 1 jj (0 jj) to construct a combined profile likelihood ratio test statistic [64] in bins of m T (m jj ) and computing a 95% confidence level (CL) upper limit (UL) on the signal cross section using the asymptotic CL s criterion [64][65][66]. Systematic uncertainties are taken into account as nuisance parameters, which are removed by profiling, assuming gamma function or log-normal priors for normalization parameters, and Gaussian priors for mass spectrum shape uncertainties. The combination of the four search channels requires simultaneous analysis of the data from the individual channels, accounting for all statistical and systematic uncertainties and their correlations. Correlations among backgrounds, both -16 -   For the smallest value of \u2206m = 1 GeV, the 0 jj channel provides the best sensitivity, while the VBF soft-e and soft-\u00b5 channels provide the best sensitivity for the larger mass gap scenario with \u2206m = 50 GeV. The four channels are combined and the results are presented in figure 5. Figure 5 (left) shows the 95% CL UL on the signal cross section, as a function of m( \u03c7 \u00b1 1 ) and \u2206m, assuming x = 0.5. Figure 5 (right) shows the 95% CL UL on the signal cross section, as a function of m( \u03c7 \u00b1 1 ), for two fixed \u2206m values of 1 and 30 GeV, and assuming x = 0.5. The signal acceptance and mass shape are evaluated for each {m( \u03c7 \u00b1 1 ), \u2206m} combination and used in the limit calculation procedure described above. For the \u2206m = {1, 10, 30, 50} GeV assumption, the combination of the four channels results in an observed (expected) exclusion on the \u03c7 0 2 and \u03c7 \u00b1 1 gaugino masses below {112, 159, 215, 207} ({125, 171, 235, 228}) GeV. For the compressed mass spectrum scenarios with 1 \u2264 \u2206m \u2264 30 GeV, the bounds on the \u03c7 0 2 and \u03c7 \u00b1 1 gaugino masses are the most stringent to date.   Figure 5. (Left) Expected and observed 95% confidence level upper limit (UL) on the signal cross section as a function of m( \u03c7 \u00b1 1 ) and \u2206m, assuming the light slepton model with slepton mass defined as the average of the \u03c7 0 2 and \u03c7 \u00b1 1 masses, x = 0.5. The lower left edge of each bin represents the {m( \u03c7 \u00b1 1 ),\u2206m} combination used to calculate the UL on the signal cross section. For example, the lowest and leftmost bin corresponds to the UL on the signal cross section for the scenario with m( \u03c7 It is noted that for the 1 < \u2206m < 10 GeV mass gaps considered in this analysis, the exclusions on m( \u03c7 \u00b1 1 ) do not depend on the assumption that a light slepton exists (i.e. m( \u03c7 0 1 ) < m < m( \u03c7 \u00b1 1 )). For 1 < \u2206m < 10 GeV, the signal acceptance for the WZ model is similar to the signal acceptance for the light slepton model. For example, figure 3 (lower right) shows the expected m jj signal distribution when the decays of the charginos and neutralinos proceed via W and Z bosons, resulting in a similar shape and normalization as the expectation for the light slepton scenario. However, for increasing \u2206m values where the 1 jj channels dominate the sensitivity, the exclusions on m( \u03c7 \u00b1 1 ) in the WZ model are less stringent than the ones in the light slepton model. This difference is a result of the lower branching ratio of \u03c7 \u00b1 1 and \u03c7 0 2 to leptonic final states in the WZ model. Figure 6 (left) shows the 95% CL UL on the signal cross section, as a function of m( \u03c7 \u00b1 1 ) and \u2206m, assuming the WZ model. Figure 6 (right) shows the 95% CL UL on the signal cross section, as a function of m( \u03c7 \u00b1 1 ), for two fixed \u2206m values of 1 and 30 GeV, and assuming the WZ model. For the \u2206m = {1, 10, 30, 50} GeV assumption, the combination of the four channels results in an observed (expected) exclusion on the \u03c7 0 2 and \u03c7 \u00b1 1 gaugino masses below {112, 146, 175, 162} ({125, 160, 194, 178}) GeV. For the compressed mass spectrum scenarios with 1 \u2264 \u2206m < 3 GeV and 25 \u2264 \u2206m < 50 GeV, the bounds on the \u03c7 0 2 and \u03c7 \u00b1 1 gaugino masses in the WZ model are also the most stringent to date, surpassing the bounds from the LEP experiments [67][68][69][70].",

[71] reported a search using the VBF dijet topology with a zero-lepton final state in proton-proton collision data at \u221a s = 8 TeV, this is the first search for the compressed electroweak supersymmetry (SUSY) sector using the 0 jj final state. This is also the first search for SUSY in the VBF topology with single soft-lepton final states. The VBF topology requires two well-separated jets that appear in opposite hemispheres, with large invariant mass m jj . The observed m jj and transverse mass m T ( , p miss T ) distributions do not reveal any evidence for new physics. The results are used to exclude a range of \u03c7 \u00b1 1 and \u03c7 0 2 gaugino masses. For a compressed mass spectrum scenario, in which \u2206m \u2261 m( \u03c7 \u00b1 1 ) \u2212 m( \u03c7 0 1 ) = 1 (30) GeV and in which \u03c7 \u00b1 1 and \u03c7 0 2 branching fractions to light sleptons are 100%, \u03c7 \u00b1 1 and \u03c7 0 2 masses up to 112 (215) GeV are excluded at 95% CL. For the scenario where the sleptons are too heavy and decays of the charginos and neutralinos proceed via W * and Z * bosons, \u03c7 \u00b1 1 and \u03c7 0 2 masses up to 112 (175) GeV are excluded at 95% CL for \u2206m = 1 (30) GeV. While many previous studies at the LHC have focused on strongly coupled supersymmetric particles, including searches for charginos and neutralinos produced in gluino or squark decay chains, and a number of studies have presented limits on the Drell-Yan production of charginos and neutralinos, this analysis obtains the most stringent limits to date on the production of charginos and neutralinos decaying to leptons in compressed mass spectrum scenarios defined by the mass separation 1 \u2264 \u2206m < 3 GeV and 25 \u2264 \u2206m < 50 GeV.",
