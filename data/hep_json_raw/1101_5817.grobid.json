The present analysis is based on 40% of the data sample. The beam line and setup of the NA48/2 experiment [6] were used for the NA62 data taking. Experimental conditions and trigger logic were optimized for the R K measurement. The beam line delivered simultaneous unseparated K + and K \u2212 beams derived from 400 GeV /c primary protons extracted from the CERN SPS. Most of the data, including the sample used for the present analysis, were collected with the K + beam only, as the muon sweeping system provided better suppression of the positive beam halo component. A narrow momentum band of (74.0 \u00b1 1.6)GeV /c was used to minimize the corresponding contribution to resolution in kinematical variables. The fiducial decay region was contained in a 114 m long cylindrical vacuum tank. The beam flux at the entrance to the decay volume was 2.5 \u00d7 10 7 particles per pulse of 4.8 s duration. The fractions of K + , \u03c0 + , p, e + , \u00b5 + in the beam were 0.05, 0.63, 0.21, 0.10, 0.01 respectively. The fraction of beam kaons decaying in the vacuum tank at nominal momentum was 18%. The transverse size of the beam within the decay volume was x = y = 7 mm (rms), and its angular divergence was negligible. A minimum bias trigger configuration was employed, resulting in high efficiency with relatively low purity. The Ke2 trigger condition consisted of coincidence of hits in the plastic scintillator hodoscope with 10GeV energy deposition in the calorimeter. The K\u00b52 trigger condition consisted of the hodoscope signal alone downscaled by a factor of 150.",

Sufficient kinematic separation between electron and muon decays is not achievable at high lepton momentum (p > 30GeV /c), as shown in Fig.1(Left). The probability of muon identification as positron in that momentum range is P (\u00b5 \u2192 e) \u223c 4 \u00d7 10 \u22126 , as E/p > 0.95 due to catastrophic bremsstrahlung in or in front of the calorimeter. Since such probability is non-negligible for the measurement in question, a direct measurement of P (\u00b5 \u2192 e) to 10 \u22122 relative precision is necessary to validate the theoretical calculation of the bremsstrahlung cross-section [8] in the high energy \u03b3 range used to evaluate the K\u00b52 background. The available muon samples are typically affected by \u223c 10 \u22124 electron/positron contamination due to \u00b5 \u2192 e decays in flight, which obstructs the probability measurements. In order to obtain sufficiently pure muon samples, a 9.2X 0 thick lead (Pb) wall covering 20% of the geometric acceptance was installed in front of the calorimeter during a fraction of the data taking. In the samples of tracks traversing the Pb and having E/p > 0.95, the electron component is suppressed to a level of \u223c 10 \u22128 by energy losses in Pb. However, Pb wall modifies P (\u00b5 \u2192 e) via two principal mechanisms: 1) muon energy loss in the Pb by ionization, dominating at low momentum; 2) bremsstrahlung in Pb, dominating at high momentum. To evaluate the corresponding correction factor f P b = P \u00b5e /P P b \u00b5e , a dedicated Geant4 based simulation of muon propagation downstream the spectrometer involving all electromagnetic processes, including muon bremsstrahlung has been developed. The relative systematic uncertainties on P \u00b5e and P P b \u00b5e obtained from simulation are estimated to be 10% -measured and simulated probabilities are shown Fig.1(Right). The error affecting their ratio is significantly smaller (2%) due to partial cancellation of uncertainties. The K\u00b52 background has been computed to be (6.10 \u00b1 0.22)% using the measured P P b \u00b5e corrected for the simulated f P b and correcting for the correlation between the reconstructed M 2 miss (e) and E/p.",
