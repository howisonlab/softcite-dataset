            "text": "Quarkonium pair production is an important probe of both perturbative and nonperturbative processes in quantum chromodynamics. Experimental studies of this process can provide valuable information about the underlying mechanisms of particle production and improve our understanding of numerous physics processes that are treated as backgrounds in searches and measurements. Quarkonium pairs may originate from single-parton scattering (SPS) or double-parton scattering (DPS). These production mechanisms can be separated experimentally since the DPS production is characterized, among other features, by more forward and separated mesons. The analysis of nonperturbative effects is easier for quarkonium states composed of b quarks, as their large masses allow them to be approximated as nonrelativistic systems [1]. The CMS Collaboration observed for the first time the production of a pair of Y(1S) mesons, using proton-proton data collected at a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV [2]. This Letter presents a measurement of the Y(1S) pair production cross section at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The cross section is measured in the fiducial region where both Y(1S) mesons have an E-mail address: cms -publication -committee -chair @cern .ch. absolute rapidity below 2.0, using the final state with four muons. Additionally, the DPS contribution to the process is measured for the first time.",

A generic search for narrow resonances with mass between 16.5 and 27 GeV and decaying to a Y(1S) meson and a pair of muons is also presented. The final state is the same as for the measurement of the Y(1S) pair production cross section, and a similar event selection is used.

Fig. 5 shows the m 4\u03bc models obtained from simulated DPS and SPS events, together with the average fit model. The number of Y(1S)Y(1S) events in the signal region is extracted, as detailed in Section 5, using the selection designed for the resonance search and without applying the acceptance and efficiency corrections from Eq. (2). In this case, only events with 13 < m 4\u03bc < 28 GeV are retained and no rapidity criteria are applied for the reconstructed Y(1S) candidates. The yield is measured to be 78 \u00b1 13 events. The requirement that the mass of a dimuon pair is compatible with the mass of a Y(1S) meson within two standard deviations is enforced in the resonance search but is not applied to extract the yield because the 2D fit relies on the mass tails to estimate the combinatorial background. Since the efficiency of this criterion is 95% in both the SPS and DPS Y(1S)Y(1S) simulations, the Y(1S)Y(1S) yield in the signal region is corrected to 74 \u00b1 13. The normalization of the Y(1S) pair production process and its uncertainty are extracted from the same data as in the signal region of the resonance search, but this does not lead to a significant overconstraint of the uncertainty in the maximum-likelihood fit of the m 4\u03bc distribution because the latter can determine the Y(1S) pair normalization only with poor precision.",

The extracted fiducial cross sections as a function of | y(Y(1S), Y(1S))| and m Y(1S)Y(1S) are compared to the expected distributions for SPS and DPS production, as obtained in the fiducial region using pythia for the DPS process, and from HELAC-Onia with the NLO* CSM predictions for the SPS process. The fraction f DPS is measured with a binned maximum-likelihood fit of these two simulated distributions with floating normalizations to the measured fiducial cross sections in bins of | y(Y(1S), Y(1S))| and m Y(1S)Y(1S) . As determined from pseudo-experiments, the best precision is expected to be achieved using | y(Y(1S), Y(1S))|. Theoretical uncertainties coming from the choice of parton distribution functions and the factorization and renormalization scales are taken into account for both the SPS and DPS predicted distributions. The fraction f DPS is measured to be (39 \u00b1 14)% using | y(Y(1S), Y(1S))| as the discriminative distribution.
