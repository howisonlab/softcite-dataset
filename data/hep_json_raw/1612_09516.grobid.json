Results are based on samples of protonproton collisions collected with the CMS detector at the LHC at center-of-mass energies of 8 and 13 TeV, corresponding to integrated luminosities of 19.7 and 2.7 fb \u22121 , respectively. The results of the search are combined with those of a similar search in the leptonic decay modes of the Z boson, based on the same data sets. Spin-0 resonances with various widths and with masses in a range between 0.2 and 3.0 TeV are considered. No significant excess is observed either in the individual analyses or the combination. The results are presented in terms of upper limits on the production cross section of such resonances and constitute the most stringent limits to date for a wide range of masses.",

Resonances with a spin of 0, 1, or 2 that can decay via the Z\u03b3 channel feature in a variety of proposed theoretical extensions of the SM. Examples include: technicolor [8], extended Higgs boson sector [9,10], extra spatial dimension [11,12], and little Higgs [13] models, as well other beyond the SM theories. The Z\u03b3 mode is also an important, and yet to be established, decay of the Higgs boson. In particular, the H(125) boson is expected to decay in the Z\u03b3 channel with a branching fraction of 0.16%, compared to the 0.23% and 2.67% branching fractions in the \u03b3 \u03b3 and ZZ channels, respectively [14].

The input to the BDT algorithm contains shower shape and isolation variables, as well as variables that account for the dependencies of the shower shape and isolation variables on the additional interactions in the same or neighboring bunch crossings (pileup) [28]. In addition, a conversion-safe electron veto (CSEV) [28] is applied. Isolation variables are computed from PF candidates in a cone of radius R = \u221a ( \u03c6) 2 + ( \u03b7) 2 < 0.3 around the photon candidate.",

In both 8 and 13 TeV analyses, they are reconstructed using PF candidates. The 8 TeV analysis employs the Cambridge-Aachen (CA) clustering algorithm [29], while the 13 TeV analysis uses the anti-k T algorithm [30], both with a distance parameter of 0.8. (The change in the default jet clustering algorithm for 13 TeV data was motivated by commissioning of new jet substructure triggers, which rely on the faster anti-k T algorithm.) Charged hadrons not originating from the primary vertex are not considered in jet clustering. Corrections based on the jet area [31] are applied to remove the energy contribution of neutral hadrons from pileup interactions. The energy of the jets is further corrected for the response function of the calorimeter. Jet energy corrections are derived from simulation and are confirmed with in situ measurements using the energy balance of dijet, multijet, \u03b3 +jet, and leptonically decaying Z+jet events [32,33]. Additional quality criteria are applied to the jets in order to remove rare spurious noise patterns in the calorimeters, and also to suppress leptons misidentified as jets. All jets are required to have p T > 170 (200) GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.0 in the 8 (13) TeV analysis. The requirement on the jet \u03b7 suppresses Table 1 Summary of event selection.",

The algorithm first reclusters each jet starting from its original constituents with the CA algorithm and then discards soft and wide-angle radiation in each step of the iterative CA procedure. The same pruning algorithm parameters are used for 8 and 13 TeV data [36]. The pruned jet mass (M j ) is computed from the sum of the four-momenta of the remaining constituents, and is corrected with the same factor as the one used to correct the jet energy. To select a Z boson candidate we require the pruned jet mass to be between 70 and 110 GeV (75 and 105 GeV) in 8 (13) TeV data.

At the lower edge of this mass range about 50% of Z boson decays correspond to the merged jet topology; for resonance masses above 2 TeV this fraction exceeds 90%. In order to profit from both the high acceptance and low background, two exclusive search categories are formed in the analysis: a b-tagged category with a large-cone jet required to be consistent with the Z \u2192 bb decay (as described in the previous section), and an antitagged category with the large-cone jet failing this requirement. While the branching fraction of Z \u2192 bb decay is only about 20% of all hadronic decays, and there is an additional signal loss due to b tagging inefficiency, the background rejection due to b tagging exceeds a factor of 100. Consequently, the sensitivity of the b-tagged category in the low-mass range with large background is significant, leading to a sizable improvement (as large as 50%) in the signal sensitivity by splitting an inclusive selection into the two categories. Fig. 1 shows the total selection and reconstruction efficiency for the X \u2192 Z\u03b3 decay mode of a narrow resonance in the two analysis categories. The total signal efficiency increases from 17% (12%) at 0.65 TeV to 20% (20%) at 2 TeV in the antitagged category for the 8 (13) TeV analysis, and is between 2 and 3% for the masses below 2 TeV in the b-tagged category. At very high resonance masses the b tagging efficiency drops owing to the inability of the b tagging algorithm to disentangle individual jet components among highly collimated decay products. For a broad resonance at high masses (>1.5 TeV) the effect of rapidly falling PDFs introduces a lower tail in the mass distribution. The exact characteristics of this tail are very sensitive to the description of the resonance line-shape. Therefore, in this search, we require that the mass of the resonance corresponds to the core of the distribution, defined as a window centered on the maximum of the Crystal Ball [52] (CB) function.",

The shapes obtained in these fits are used to generate pseudo-data sets with a total number of events randomly drawn from a Poisson distribution with the mean equal to the yields observed in data. Additionally, in a set of pseudo-experiments, signals with different mass values and cross sections close to the expected 95% confidence level (CL) limits are injected. The full spectrum is fitted with the chosen function of Eq. (1) together with a signal model, and the signal cross section is extracted. Distributions of the difference between the data and the fit divided by the overall uncertainty for the obtained signal cross sections are constructed, and their shapes are found to be consistent with a normal distribution with mean less than 0.5 and width consistent with unity.

The table shows also individual limits from fits to a sin- gle category, illustrating the relative weights of the two categories for various masses. The 8 and 13 TeV results can be combined assuming a particular production mechanism for a resonance decaying into the Z\u03b3 channel. Similar to the combination of Z\u03b3 searches in the leptonic decay channel of the Z boson [15], we assume that the hypothetical spin-0 resonance is produced exclusively via gluon fusion, which is a natural production mechanism for a spin-0 particle with Yukawa-like couplings to quarks. The combination takes into account the ratio of gluon-gluon parton luminosities at the two center-of-mass energies, as calculated with the NNPDF2.3 PDFs. This ratio increases from approximately 4.1 for an invariant mass of 0.65 TeV to 23.7 for a mass of 2.5 TeV. It was checked that the uncertainty in the ratio of parton luminosities at 13 and 8 TeV coming from the PDF uncertainties has negligible effect on the combined results in the range of masses probed. The combination is performed with the same CL s criterion as used to obtain results in the individual channels. We assume that all sources of systematic uncertainty, except for the one related to the photon energy scale, are completely uncorrelated between the analyses at the two energies. This is a reasonable assumption, given that the dominant sources of the systematic uncertainty are the statistical uncertainty in the background fit and b tagging efficiency uncertainties in the signal yield, both of which are determined independently in the 8 and 13 TeV data, and therefore are uncorrelated.",

The search is carried out with two exclusive categories of events, with or without identification of the Z \u2192 bb decay, and the final result is obtained from the combination of these two categories. Jet substructure and subjet b tagging techniques are used in order to enhance the sensitivity of the analysis. No significant deviation from the standard model prediction is found. Results are presented as upper limits at 95% confidence level on the product of the production cross section and the branching fraction of the Z\u03b3 decay channel of a new resonance. The results of the searches at the two center-of-mass energies are combined assuming the mechanism for production of a new resonance is gluon fusion. These results are further combined with those of analogous searches in the leptonic decay channel of the Z boson. The limits set in this analysis are the most stringent limits to date on Z\u03b3 resonances in a wide range of masses. technical and administrative staffs at CERN and at other CMS institutes for their contributions to the success of the CMS effort.
