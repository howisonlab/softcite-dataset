The measurements are made using data corresponding to integrated luminosities of 29.4 and 28.1 nb \u22121 for Z \u2192 ee and Z \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc, respectively. The results from the two channels are consistent and combined to obtain a cross section times the Z \u2192 branching ratio, integrated over the rapidity region |y * Z | < 3.5, of 139.8 \u00b1 4.8 (statistical) \u00b1 6.2 (systematic) \u00b1 3.8 (luminosity) nb. Differential cross sections are presented as functions of the Z boson rapidity and transverse momentum and compared with models based on parton distributions both with and without nuclear corrections. The centrality dependence of Z boson production in p + Pb collisions is measured and analyzed within the framework of a standard Glauber model and the model's extension for fluctuations of the underlying nucleon-nucleon scattering cross section.",

            "text": "The study of electroweak bosons in Pb + Pb collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN has demonstrated that the production rate of non-strongly interacting particles scales with the number of nucleon-nucleon collisions, N coll . This has been observed for photons [1], W bosons [2,3], and Z bosons [4,5]. The momentum and rapidity distributions of Z boson yields are consistent with PYTHIA [6] simulations of pp collisions multiplied by the average nuclear thickness function, T AA , which is equivalent to N coll divided by the total nucleon-nucleon cross section [4]. Z boson production in Pb + Pb collisions was found to be consistent with next-toleading-order perturbative quantum chromodynamics (NLO QCD) calculations that disregard nuclear modifications in the treatment of parton distribution functions (PDFs). However, nuclear modification is not excluded within the precision of the measurement [7]. The production of Z bosons, examined as a function of centrality, was also found to scale with N coll .",

            "text": "To differentiate between initial-and final-state effects in heavy-ion collisions, the study of p + Pb collisions is used at the LHC. One would expect that hot and dense QCD medium cannot be formed in such collisions, unlike in the Pb + Pb case, and that modifications to final-state particles relative to nucleon-nucleon collisions should originate from the initial state of the nucleus. This assumption was challenged by the very first results from p + Pb collisions at \u221a s NN = 5.02 TeV produced at the LHC in 2012. Results on multiparticle correlations, published for three LHC experiments [8][9][10][11][12][13][14], revealed collective behavior in p + Pb collisions similar to that previously measured in heavy-ion collision systems. The yields of jets measured by ATLAS scale with N coll when measured inclusively for all centralities but show significant deviations from binary scaling when considered in centrality selections [15]. The CMS Collaboration has measured dijet pseudorapidity distributions and found them to agree better with predictions that include nuclear PDF modifications than with predictions that do not include nuclear effects [16]. The CMS Collaboration has also recently measured the production of W bosons in p + Pb collisions and observed hints of nuclear modifications of the PDF [17]. Collectively, these results have highlighted the need for a better understanding of the initial conditions of p + Pb collisions. Unlike symmetric Pb + Pb collisions, in p + Pb collisions nuclear modifications of the PDFs in the lead nucleus create an asymmetry in the rapidity-dependent cross section of Z bosons; this presents an attractive observable for the study of initial-state nuclear conditions. The centrality-dependent yield of Z bosons is a well-suited probe to test our understanding of p + Pb collision geometry. The LHCb Collaboration has made a first exploratory measurement of Z bosons at far forward and backward rapidities [18] based on an integrated luminosity of 1.6 nb \u22121 .",

            "text": "This paper presents the results of the measurement of Z boson production in p + Pb collisions at \u221a s NN = 5.02 TeV using the ATLAS detector. The yield of Z bosons is measured as a function of their transverse momentum p Z T , rapidity in the center-of-mass frame (y * Z ), 1 and centrality. The leptonic 1 ATLAS uses a right-handed coordinate system with its origin at the nominal interaction point in the center of the detector and the z axis along the beam pipe. The x axis points from the interaction point to the center of the LHC ring, and the y axis points upward. Cylindrical coordinates (r,\u03c6) are used in the transverse plane, \u03c6 being the azimuthal angle around the beam pipe. The rapidity in the laboratory frame is given by y lab = 1 2 ln E+pz E\u2212pz and pseudorapidity is defined as \u03b7 = \u2212 ln[tan(\u03b8/2)]. Positive rapidity corresponds to the direction the proton beam travels, \"proton-going,\" and negative rapidity is referred to as \"Pb-going.\" In this convention the asymmetric beam energies result in a center of mass shifted to rapidity, y * = y lab \u2212 0.465. decays of the Z boson (Z \u2192 ee and Z \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc) are used for its reconstruction. In the muon channel it is possible to reconstruct the Z boson in the rapidity range \u22123 < y * Z < 2, while in the electron channel this range can be extended to |y * Z | < 3.5. The larger acceptance in rapidity for Z \u2192 ee candidates is possible because of the larger acceptance of the ATLAS calorimeters compared to the muon spectrometer (MS; Secs. II and III B). The efficiency of Z boson reconstruction is calculated from detector simulations (Sec. III D). Backgrounds in each channel are estimated using simulations and data-driven methods (Sec. III E). Results measured in the dimuon and dielectron decay channels are combined after accounting for uncertainties and their correlations (Sec. III G). The measured cross sections and centrality-dependent yields are compared to models of p + Pb collisions composed of 82 pp and 126 pn collisions in which the production of Z bosons is obtained using perturbative QCD calculations.",

Systematic uncertainties similar to those studied for the calculation of pp luminosity [21] are calculated. The combination of these systematic uncertainties results in a total uncertainty in the ATLAS luminosity scale during proton-lead collisions at \u221a s NN = 5.02 TeV of 2.7%. Minimum-bias p + Pb collisions were selected by a trigger based on a signal in both MBTS counters.

In addition to the reconstruction requirements, further electron identification selections based primarily on the shower shape in the electromagnetic calorimeter are made to reject background. Electron identification requirements used in previous ATLAS analyses [23] are used to provide quality classification of electrons based on the tightness of the identification criteria they satisfy. The triggering electron is required to have E T > 20 GeV, to be outside the pseudorapidity interval 1.37 < |\u03b7| < 1.52 (a transition region between the barrel and the endcap calorimeters which contains a relatively large amount of inactive material), and to satisfy tight identification quality requirements.

Forward electrons are those reconstructed within the range 2.5 < |\u03b7| < 4.9 based on energy deposited in the FCal [23].

For the study of the y * Z distribution as a function of centrality (see Sec. IV B), larger bins are used: 0-10%, 10-40%, and 40-90%. For the most peripheral collisions, centrality greater than 90%, centrality modeling, and associated geometric quantities are not well constrained. Pileup events, those containing multiple p + Pb interactions from the same bunch crossing, are removed by rejecting events in which more than one primary vertex is reconstructed. The fraction of candidate events which is removed from the centrality-selected Z boson yield analysis due to pileup rejection is approximately 5%.

The presence of a Z boson (or any hard process) is correlated with a higher transverse energy of the underlying event. Consequently, more energy may be deposited in the Pb-going-side FCal in events containing a hard scattering process than in those that do not contain one. This causes a bias in the centrality-dependent yield, as the Z boson yield is enhanced in the more central events but depleted in the more peripheral ones. This effect, referred to as a centrality bias, has been noted for yields of hard processes in d + Au collisions at \u221a s NN = 200 GeV by the PHENIX Collaboration [28] and in p + Pb collisions at \u221a s NN = 5.02 TeV by the ALICE Collaboration [29]. A correction to the centrality-dependent yields of hard processes in d + Au collisions at \u221a s NN = 200 GeV has been studied by the PHENIX Collaboration [28] (the correction is also calculated for p + Pb at \u221a s NN = 5.02 TeV). The centrality bias correction used by the PHENIX Collaboration is based on the modeling of an increase in the mean particle multiplicity produced by the specific NN collision that undergoes a hard scattering. Recently, similar calculations of a centrality bias have been made in which all NN collisions may contribute to an increase in the particle multiplicity [30]. The increase in multiplicity stemming from each NN collision is taken to be proportional to the contribution from that collision to the E T in the event. This model is applied to the ATLAS p + Pb centrality classification for the standard Glauber analysis as well as the GGCF models and, thus, used to calculate corrections to the hard process yield measured in a given centrality bin. Because the N part probability distribution varies  [30], for the Glauber and GGCF model configurations, and bias correction factors derived from data (points) as explained in the text. The reciprocals of the correction factors are applied as multiplicative factors to the centrality-dependent Z boson yields.",

To do so, the corrections are calculated by comparing the transverse energy deposited in the FCal in events selected by the minimum-bias trigger and in Z boson events from pp collisions (in which there is no centrality to consider). This effect is studied in pp collisions at \u221a s = 2.76 TeV and \u221a s = 7 TeV from the 2011 LHC run. At both energies a significant increase in the mean transverse energy deposited in the FCal is observed and, within the uncertainties of the measurement, found to be independent of the Z boson kinematics. A single value is interpolated from the \u221a s = 2.76 TeV and \u221a s = 7 TeV data for \u221a s NN = 5.02 TeV. The interpolation is performed using both logarithmic and linear expressions, and the difference between them contributes to the systematic uncertainty. A correction is made to account for the shifted center of mass in the p + Pb system, which changes the effective FCal acceptance in \u03b7 compared to pp. From this procedure an additive shift to E FCal T of 2.0 \u00b1 0.5 GeV is calculated. In each p + Pb Z \u2192 event this value is subtracted from E FCal T and the resulting value used to determine a corrected centrality of the event. The centrality-dependent yield may be constructed, according to the method described in Sec. III E, using both the subtracted and the unsubtracted E FCal T values and their ratio is then comparable to a centrality bias correction factor that may be compared to those calculated in Ref. [30]. As shown in Fig. 1, within the uncertainties this data-based method is compatible with the model calculations.",

The tag is defined as a fully reconstructed high-quality triggered lepton, whereas the probe is a lepton candidate to which triggering, reconstruction, or quality requirements are not applied. Using tag-and-probe pairs with an invariant mass m consistent with selection of Z bosons, the efficiency of the probe with additional requirements is calculated. The mass window used depends on the background present in the probe sample and ranges from 80 < m < 100 to 87 < m < 95 GeV. For example, the electron trigger efficiency is measured from high-quality reconstructed electron probes selected without an a priori trigger requirement, and the MS reconstruction efficiency is measured from charged-particle tracks in the ID without an a priori MS signal requirement. The MC simulation is scaled to match the efficiencies determined with the data-driven tag-and-probe method. The factors used to scale the MC electron response are derived from the 2013 p + Pb data set. Muon reconstruction is insensitive to the differences between 2013 p + Pb and 2012 pp conditions and therefore the scale factors for muons are taken from Z \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc events collected in the 2012 pp data set [24].

These corrections take into account the cumulative losses due to the trigger, reconstruction, and identification efficiency as well as the kinematic acceptance of decay leptons. The correction is defined relative to all generated Z bosons within the mass window 66 < m < 116 GeV. The total efficiency for reconstructing a produced Z boson, including acceptance, is approximately 55% for Z \u2192 ee and 65% for Z \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc. Following the subtraction of background (see Sec. III E) and application of the correction factor, a corrected yield of Z bosons is obtained in each bin of p Z T and y * Z . The uncertainty of the correction factor follows from the uncertainty of the data-driven tag-and-probe checks of the MC, primarily due to the relatively low number of tag-andprobe events in the data. The uncertainty associated with the lepton identification efficiency is the dominant uncertainty for both the Z \u2192 ee and the Z \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc analyses. This uncertainty is approximately 10% for Z \u2192 ee (rising as high as 15% for pairs including a forward electron) and 1.5% for Z \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc.

When both electrons are at midrapidity (|\u03b7| < 2.47), the unlike-sign charged pairs with an invariant mass satisfying 66 < m ee < 116 GeV are accepted as signal Z boson candidates. The like-sign pairs in this window are used to estimate the combinatorial background, created primarily by jets. In total, 1647 unlike-sign pairs and 52 likesign pairs are reconstructed. The like-sign pairs are composed of combinatorial background and Z \u2192 ee decays in which one of the electrons has misreconstructed charge. The contribution from pairs with misreconstructed charge is estimated, using the MC simulation, to be half of the like-sign pairs, and the remainder is taken as an estimate of the background. Pairs made of one midrapidity electron and one nontriggering forward electron have a larger contribution from background and so an invariant mass window of 80 < m ee < 100 GeV is used to select Z boson candidates. To facilitate combination of all Z \u2192 ee candidates, an acceptance correction is made to account for the smaller mass window. No charge requirement is made for these candidates because the nontriggering electron is outside the acceptance of the ID and therefore does not have a reconstructed charge. There are 264 such candidates, of which an estimated 5% are background based on a fit of the invariant mass distribution. The fit is performed in the range 60 < m ee < 120 GeV using a signal shape from the MC simulation and several background parametrizations assuming exponential or polynomial descriptions of the background. The mass distributions of Z \u2192 ee candidates are shown in Figs. 2(a) and 2(b), along with the reconstructed MC simulation of the same quantity.

The technique uses a \u03c7 2 minimization procedure with a nuisance parameter formalism to combine the data sets coherently. The procedure distinguishes those systematic uncertainty sources that are uncorrelated bin to bin, uncorrelated across data sets, and fully correlated bin to bin and across data sets. In this way, combined points are calculated to optimize the overall agreement of the data sets, given the correlation of the uncertainties. This may result in differences in the combined Z \u2192 data points relative to the Z \u2192 ee data points in rapidity regions in which there are no Z \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc data points. Following this, an integrated cross section for the region |y * Z | < 3.5 is defined for the combined Z \u2192 points based on both the Z \u2192 ee and the Z \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc data even though the Z \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc data are limited to \u22123 < y * Z < 2.

It is found to be slightly higher than predictions based on perturbative QCD calculations. Disregarding the difference in overall normalization, the shapes of the y * Z -and x Pb -dependent cross sections are somewhat better described by models that include nuclear modification of the lead nucleus PDF compared to those that do not, although models without nuclear modification are not excluded. Following the application of a centrality bias correction, the centrality-dependent yield is found to scale with N coll . In addition, the centrality dependence of the y * Z distribution was studied, and the asymmetry in y * Z was found to be slightly larger in more central events. Integrated over y * Z , the centrality dependence appears to be consistent with binary scaling and is similar to the production of inclusive charged particles.",
