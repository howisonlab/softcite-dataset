The measurement considers events where the two leading jets are nearly collinear (\"back-to-back\") in the transverse plane and is performed for several ranges of the leading jet transverse momentum. Proton-proton collision data collected with the CMS experiment at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 are used. Predictions based on calculations using matrix elements at leading-order and next-to-leading-order accuracy in perturbative quantum chromodynamics supplemented with leading-log parton showers and hadronization are generally in agreement with the measurements. Discrepancies between the measurement and theoretical predictions are as large as 15%, mainly in the region 177 \u2022 < \u0394\u03c6 12 < 180 \u2022 . The 2-and 3-jet measurements are not simultaneously described by any of models.",

            "text": "Collimated streams of particles (jets) can be produced in highly energetic parton-parton interactions in proton-proton (s) collisions, and their properties are described by the theory of strong interactions, quantum chromodynamics (QCD). In the lowest order perturbative QCD (pQCD), two jets with high transverse momenta p T are produced \"back-to-back\" in the transverse plane. Higher order corrections lead to deviations from this configuration. Experimentally, this can be investigated by the measurement of the azimuthal separation, \u0394\u03c6 12 = |\u03c6 jet1 \u2212 \u03c6 jet2 |, between the two leading p T jets in the transverse plane. Within the framework of pQCD, a final state with three or more partons is required for significant deviations from \u0394\u03c6 12 = 180 \u2022 . However, when deviations of \u0394\u03c6 12 from 180 \u2022 are small, a pQCD calculation at a fixed order in the strong coupling \u03b1 S becomes unstable and a resummation of soft parton emissions to all orders in \u03b1 S has e-mail: cms-publication-committee-chair@cern.ch to be performed. This resummation is approximated through the use of parton showers in Monte Carlo (MC) event generators.",

A detailed study of azimuthal correlations close to the backto-back configuration allows a more precise test of different resummation strategies, and it is a first step towards an improved understanding of the effects of soft initial and final state gluons [7,8]. The leading-and next-to-leadinglogarithm contributions to the dijet azimuthal angular correlation have been investigated in [9][10][11]. The effects of applying a transverse momentum dependent parton showering to the dijet azimuthal angular correlation were studied in [12].",

Among the LO event generators, both pythia 8 [14] (version 8.219) and her-wig++ [15] (version 2.7.1) are used for predictions because they feature different parton showering (PS) algorithms for soft and collinear parton radiation at leading-log accuracy. In pythia 8 the PS emissions cover a region of phase space ordered in x (fraction of the proton momentum carried by the parton) and the p T of the emitted parton, whereas in herwig++ the parton emissions are ordered in x and the angle of the radiated parton (angular ordering). The Lund string model [16] is used for hadronization in pythia 8 [14], whereas in herwig++ the cluster fragmentation model [17] is applied. Multiparton interactions (MPI) are simulated in pythia 8 (tune CUETP8M1 [18] with the parton distribution function (PDF) set NNPDF2.3LO [19,20]) and in herwig++ (tune CUETHppS1 [18] with the PDF set CTEQ6L1 [21]) with parameters tuned to measurements in pp collisions at the LHC and pp collisions at the Tevatron.",

Jets are reconstructed by clustering the four-vectors of the PF candidates with the infrared-and collinear-safe anti-k T clustering algorithm [36] with a distance parameter R = 0.4. The clustering is performed with the FastJet pack-  [14] 2 \u21922 (LO) NNPDF2.3LO [19,20] CUETP8M1 [18] herwig++ 2.7.1 [15] 2 \u21922 (LO) CTEQ6L1 [21] CUETHppS1 [18] MadGraph [22,23]+ pythia 8.219 [14] 2 \u21922, 2\u21923, 2\u21924 (LO) NNPDF2.3LO [19,20] CUETP8M1 [18] ph-2j [24][25][26]  age [37]. To reduce the contribution to the reconstructed jets from additional pp interactions within the same bunch crossing (pileup), the charged-hadron subtraction technique [38] is used to remove tracks identified as originating from pileup vertices. The average number of pileup interactions per single bunch crossing observed in the data is about 27. The pileup contribution from neutral hadrons is corrected using a jet-area-based correction technique [39]. For this analysis, jets with rapidity |y| < 5.0 are reconstructed. For both the inclusive 2-and 3-jet samples, the events are selected by requiring the two highest p T jets to have |y| < 2.5 and p T > 100 GeV. For the inclusive 3-jet events a third jet with p T > 30 GeV and |y| < 2.5 is required. Contributions from pileup are negligible because the pileup removal algorithm has an efficiency of \u223c99% for jets with 30 < p T < 50 GeV and |y| < 2.5 [40].",

We achieve this by unfolding the observables to the level of stable finalstate particles. In this way, a direct comparison of these measurements to results from other experiments and to QCD predictions is possible. Particles are considered stable if their mean decay length is larger than 1 cm. The unfolding procedure is based on the D'Agostini algorithm [41], which is implemented in the RooUnfold package [42], by using a response matrix that maps the generated jets onto the jets reconstructed by the CMS detector. The regularization (number of iterations) of the unfolding procedure is chosen by comparing the difference in \u03c7 2 between data and MC at detector level to that between data and MC at particle level. The consistency of the unfolding procedure is checked against the alternative TUnfold package [43,44], which uses a least square minimization with Tikhonov regularization. Both methods provide equivalent results. The unfolding is performed in \u0394\u03c6 12 . The response matrices are obtained using simulated events from the pythia 8 event generator with the tune CUETP8M1. The difference between the unfolded distributions and the distributions at detector level range from \u223c1% for the low p max T regions up to \u223c5% for the high p max T regions. The sources of systematic uncertainties arise primarily from the jet energy scale calibration (JES), the jet energy resolution (JER), the \u0394\u03c6 12 resolution, and the model dependence of the unfolding matrix. The effect of migrations between p max T regions is very small because of the normalization of the cross sections in each p max T range and therefore is neglected.",

The ph-3j + pythia 8 predictions agree with the measurements except for the last bin in the low p max T intervals. The ph-2j + herwig++ prediction agrees well with the measurement in the highest p max T ranges. For the inclusive 3-jet case, ph-2j + pythia 8 performs similarly to pythia 8 and herwig++ in the whole \u0394\u03c6 12 range for high p max T intervals. MadGraph + pythia 8, ph-3j + pythia 8, and ph-2j + herwig++ show deviations from the measurements of up to 15%.",

In the figures displaying the normalized distributions, the error bars on the data represent the total experimental uncertainty and the error bars on the predictions represent the statistical uncertainty of the simulation. The uncertainties are often so small that the bars are not visible.The unfolded normalized inclusive 2-jet distribution as a function of \u0394\u03c6 12 is shown inFig. 1, and compared with the predictions from herwig++ (solid lines ) and pythia 8 (dotted lines) for different p max T regions. The distributions are strongly peaked at 180 \u2022 and become steeper with increasing p max T . The ratio of the pythia 8, herwig++, and Mad-Graph + pythia 8 event generator predictions to data are depicted inFig. 2for the inclusive 2-jet distributions in the nine p max T ranges. Among the event generators, pythia 8 and herwig++ show the largest deviations from the measurements for the p max T < 800 GeV regions in the inclusive 2-jet case, and the MadGraph + pythia 8 event generator gives the best description in the same regions. The three generators show large deviations from the measurements in the p max T",
