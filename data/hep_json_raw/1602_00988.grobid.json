This paper presents a measurement of the average number of charged particles with p T > 500 MeV inside high-momentum jets in dijet events using 20.3 fb \u22121 of data recorded with the ATLAS detector in pp collisions at \u221a s = 8 TeV collisions at the LHC. The jets considered have transverse momenta from 50 GeV up to and beyond 1.5 TeV. The reconstructed charged-particle track multiplicity distribution is unfolded to remove distortions from detector effects and the resulting charged-particle multiplicity is compared to several models. Furthermore, quark and gluon jet fractions are used to extract the average charged-particle multiplicity for quark and gluon jets separately.",

However, the properties of the resulting collimated sprays of hadrons, known as jets, depend on the type of parton which initiated them. One jet observable sensitive to the quark or gluon nature is the number of charged particles inside the jet. Due to their larger colour-charge under the strong force, gluon-initiated jets contain on average more particles than quark-initiated jets. The average (charged) particle multiplicity inside jets increases with jet energy, but increases faster for gluon-initiated jets than for quark-initiated jets [1]. These properties were used recently at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) to differentiate between jets originating from a quark or a gluon [2][3][4][5][6]. These studies have found significant differences in the charged-particle multiplicity between the available simulations and data. Improved modelling based e-mail: atlas.publications@cern.ch on measurements of the number of charged particles inside jets is thus crucial for future studies.",

The CMS measurement [33] spans jet transverse momenta between 50 and 800 GeVwith 5-10 % uncertainties in the bins of highest transverse momentum.

The data acquisition and object/event selection are described in detail in Ref. [35] and highlighted here for completeness. Jets are clustered using the anti-k t jet algorithm [36] with radius parameter R = 0.4 implemented in FastJet [37] using as inputs topological calorimeter-cell clusters [38], calibrated using the local cluster weighting (LCW) algorithm [39,40]. An overall jet energy calibration accounts for residual detector effects as well as contributions from multiple proton-proton collisions in the same bunch crossing (pileup) [41] in order to make the reconstructed jet energy correspond to an unbiased measurement of the particle-level jet energy. Jets are required to be central (|\u03b7| < 2.1) so that their charged particles are within the |\u03b7| < 2.5 coverage of the tracking detector. Events are further required to have at least two jets with p T > 50 GeV and only the leading two jets are considered for the charged-particle multiplicity measurement. To select dijet topologies where the jets are balanced in p T , the two leading jets must have p lead T / p sublead T < 1.5, where p lead T and p sublead T are the transverse momenta of the jets with the highest and second-highest p T , respectively. The jet with the smaller (larger) absolute pseudorapidity |\u03b7| is classified as the more central (more forward) jet. A measurement of the more forward and more central average chargedparticle multiplicities can exploit the rapidity dependence of the jet type to extract information about the multiplicity for quark-and gluon-initiated jets as is described in Sect. 6. The more forward jet tends to be correlated with the parton with higher longitudinal momentum fraction x, and is less likely to be a gluon-initiated jet.",

The simulated samples are described in Sect. 3. The data points have statistical uncertainties which in all bins are smaller than the marker size. There is one entry per jet tracks reconstructed from random hits in the detector. In particular, tracks are matched to the hard-scatter vertex by requiring |z 0 sin(\u03b8 )| < 1.5 mm and |d 0 | < 1 mm, where z 0 and d 0 are the track longitudinal and transverse impact parameters, respectively, calculated with respect to the primary vertex. Tracks must furthermore have at least one hit in the silicon pixel detector and at least six hits in the semiconductor microstrip detector. The matching of tracks with the calorimeter-based jets is performed via the ghost-association technique [42]: the jet clustering process is repeated with the addition of 'ghost' versions of measured tracks that have the same direction but infinitesimally small p T , so that they do not change the properties of the calorimeter-based jets. A track is associated with a jet if its ghost version is contained in the jet after reclustering. The distribution of the number of tracks in three representative jet p T ranges is shown in Fig. 1. The number of tracks increases with jet p T and the data fall mostly between the distributions predicted by Pythia and Herwig++ Monte Carlo simulations.",

As with the detector-level jets, particle-level jets are clustered with the anti-k t R = 0.4 algorithm. Any charged particle clustered in a particle-level jet is considered for the charged-particle multiplicity calculation if it has p T > 500 MeV. Events are required to have at least two jets with |\u03b7| < 2.1 and p T > 50 GeV and the two highestp T jets must satisfy the same p T -balance requirement between the leading and subleading jet as at detector level ( p lead T / p sublead T < 1.5). The p T symmetry requirement enriches the sample in a back-toback topology and suppresses non-isolated jets. In more than 70 % of events, the nearest jet in R with p T > 25 GeV is the other selected jet and in less than 7 % of events, there is a jet with p T > 25 GeV within R = 0.8 from one of the two selected jets.

An optimal value of four iterations is obtained by minimizing the bias when unfolding pseudo-data derived from Herwig++ using a prior distribution and a response matrix derived from Pythia as a test of the methodology. Lastly, unfolding applies another correction from simulation to the unfolded data to account for events passing the particle-level selection but not the detector-level selection; this correction is the inefficiency factor. Figure 3 displays the p T dependence of the average charged-particle multiplicity for uncorrected data and detector-level simulation and for particle-level simulation as well as the unfolded data. The prediction from Pythia 8 with the AU2 tune has too many tracks compared with the uncorrected data, and the size of the data/MC difference increases with decreasing track p T threshold (Fig. 3a). The difference between the detector-level and particle-level simulation in Fig. 3b (for which the ratio is given in Fig. 3d) gives an indication of the corrections required to account for detector acceptance and resolution effects in the unfolding procedure. Particle-level distributions in Fig. 3c show similar trends to the detector-level ones in Fig. 3a.",

The response matrix is taken from simulation and various experimental uncertainties in the charged-particle multiplicity and jet p T spectra result in uncertainties in the matrix. These uncertainties can be divided into two classes: those impacting the calorimeter-based jet p T and those impacting track reconstruction inside jets. The dominant uncertainty at high jet p T is due to the loss of charged-particle tracks in the jet core due to track merging. This charged energy loss uncertainty is estimated using the data/MC differences in the ratio of the track-based jet p T to the calorimeter-based jet p T [35]. More charged energy is lost in the data than in the MC and thus this uncertainty is one-sided. There are other tracking uncertainties in the track momentum scale and resolution, the track reconstruction efficiency, and the rate of tracks formed from random combinations of hits (fake tracks). The prescription for these sub-dominant tracking uncertainties is identical to Ref. [35]. The uncertainties related to the calorimeter-based jet are sub-dominant (except in the lowest p T bins) and are due to the uncertainty in the jet energy scale and the jet energy resolution. Correction factors Fake and inefficiency factors are derived from simulation to account for the fraction of events that pass either the detector-level or particle-level fiducial selection ( p T > 50 GeV |\u03b7| < 2.1, and p lead T / p sublead T < 1.5), but not both. These factors are derived in bins of jet p T and charged particle multiplicity, separately for the more forward and more central jets. They are generally between 0.9 and 1.0 except in the first jetp T interval (50 < p T < 100 GeV), where threshold effects cause the correction factors to take values down to 0.8. Experimental uncertainties correlated with the detector-level selection acceptance, such as the jet energy scale uncertainty, result in uncertainties in these correction factors. Another source of uncertainty in the correction factors is the explicit dependence on the particle-level multiplicity and jet p T spectrum. A comparison of particle-level models (Pythia and Herwig++) is used to estimate the impact on the correction factors. Unfolding procedure A data-driven technique is used to estimate the potential bias from a given choice of a prior distribution and number of iterations in the IB method [63]. The particle-level spectrum is reweighted so that the simulated detector-level spectrum, from propagating the reweighted particle-level spectrum through the response matrix, has significantly improved agreement with the uncorrected data. The modified detector-level distribution is unfolded with the nominal response matrix and the difference between this and the reweighted particle-level spectrum is an indication of the bias due to the unfolding method (in particular, the choice of a prior distribution).",

            "text": "The unfolded average charged-particle multiplicity combining both the more forward and the more central jets is shown in Fig. 4, compared with various model predictions. As was already observed for the reconstructed data in Fig. 1, the average charged-particle multiplicity in data falls between the predictions of Pythia 8 and Herwig++, independently of the underlying-event tunes. The Pythia 8 predictions are generally higher than the data and this is more pronounced at higher jet p T . The default ATLAS tune in Run 1 (AU2) performs similarly to the Monash tune, but the prediction with A14 (the ATLAS default for the analysis of Run 2 data) is significantly closer to the data. A previous ATLAS measurement [31] of charged-particle multiplicity inside jets was included in the tuning of A14, but the jets in that measurement have p T 50 GeV. One important difference between A14 and Monash is that the value of \u03b1 s governing the amount of final-state radiation is about 10 % lower in A14 than in Monash. This parameter has a large impact on the average charged-particle multiplicity, which is shown by the Pythia 6 lines in Fig. 4 where the Perugia radHi and radLo tunes are significantly separated from the central P2012 tune. The \u03b1 s value that regulates final-state radiation is changed by factors of one half and two for these tunes with respect to the nominal Perugia 2012 tune. The recent (and Run 2 default) EE5 underlying-event tune for Herwig++ improves the modelling of the average charged-particle multiplicity with respect to the EE3 tune (Run 1 default).   The difference in the average charged-particle multiplicity between the more forward and the more central jet is sensitive to the difference between quark and gluon constituent multiplicities. Figure 5a shows that the difference is significant for p T 1.1 TeV. The shape is governed by the difference in the gluon fraction between the more forward and the more central jet, which was shown in Fig. 2 to peak around p T \u223c 350 GeV. The average difference, combined with the gluon fraction, can be used to extract the average charged-particle multiplicity for quark-and gluon-initiated jets separately. Given the quark and gluon fractions f f,c q,g with f = more forward, c = more central, q = quark, g = gluon and f q + f g = 1, the average charged-particle multiplicity for quark-and gluon-initiated jets is extracted by solving the system of equations in Eq. (1);",

            "text": "Given the jet p T , the charged particle multiplicity inside jets does not vary significantly with \u03b7. This is confirmed by checking that the solution to Eq. 1 reproduces the quark and gluon jet charged particle multiplicities for both Pythia 8 and Herwig++ to better than 1 % across most of the p T range. The extracted p T dependence of the average chargedparticle multiplicities for quark-and gluon-initiated jets is shown in Fig. 5b. Pythia 8 with the CT10 PDF set is used to determine the gluon fractions. The experimental uncertainties are propagated through Eq. (1) by recomputing the quark and gluon average charged-particle multiplicities for each variation accounting for a systematic uncertainty; the more forward and more central jet uncertainties are treated as being fully correlated. In addition to the experimental uncertainties, the error bands in Fig. 5b include uncertainties in the gluon fractions from both the PDF and matrix element (ME) uncertainties. The PDF uncertainty is determined using the CT10 eigenvector PDF sets and validated by comparing CT10 and NNPDF. The ME uncertainty is estimated by comparing the fractions f f,c q,g from Pythia 8 and Herwig++ after reweighting the Pythia 8 sample with CT10 to CTEQ6L1 to match the PDF used for Herwig++. All PDF re-weighting is performed using LHAPDF6 [64]. The PDF and ME uncertainties are comparable in size to the total experimental uncertainty. As expected, the average multiplicity increases with jet p T for both the quarkinitiated jets and gluon-initiated jets, but increases faster for gluon-initiated jets. Furthermore, the multiplicity is significantly higher for gluon-initiated jets than for quark-initiated jets. The average charged-particle multiplicity in Pythia 8 with the AU2 tune is higher than in the data for both the quark-and gluon-initiated jets. In addition to predictions from leading-logarithm parton shower simulations, calcu-   lations of the scale dependence for the parton multiplicity inside jets have been performed in perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD). Up to a non-perturbative factor that is constant for the jet p T range considered in this analysis, 3 these calculations can be interpreted as a prediction for the scale dependence of n charged for quark-and gluon-initiated jets. There are further caveats to the predictability of such a calculation since n charged is not infrared safe or even Sudakov safe [65]. Therefore, the formal accuracy of the series expansion in \u221a \u03b1 s is unknown. Given these caveats, the next-to-next-to-next-to-leading-order (N 3 LO) pQCD calculation [66,67] is overlaid in Fig. 5 with renormalization scale \u03bc = Rp T in the five-flavour scheme and R = 0.4. The theoretical error band is calculated by varying \u03bc by a factor of two. The prediction cannot give the absolute scale, The jet p T dependence of a the difference in the average charged-particle multiplicity ( p track T > 0.5 GeV) between the more forward and the more central jet. The band for the data is the sum in quadrature of the systematic and statistical uncertainties and the error bars on the data points represent the statistical uncertainty. Bands on the simulation include MC statistical uncertainty. The jet p T dependence of b the average charged-particle multiplicity ( p track T > 0.5 GeV) for quark-and gluon-initiated jets, extracted with the gluon fractions from Pythia 8.175 with the CT10 PDF. In addition to the experimental uncer-tainties, the error bands include uncertainties in the gluon fractions from both the PDF and ME uncertainties. The MC statistical uncertainties on the open markers are smaller than the markers. The uncertainty band for the N 3 LO pQCD prediction is determined by varying the scale \u03bc by a factor of two up and down. The markers are truncated at the penultimate p T bin in the right because within statistical uncertainty, the more forward and more central jet constituent charged-particle multiplicities are consistent with each other in the last bin and therefore the curve is normalized in the second p T bin (100 GeV< p T < 200 GeV) where the statistical uncertainty is small. The predicted scale dependence for gluon-initiated jets is consistent with the data within the uncertainty bands while the curve for quark-initiated jets is higher than the data by about one standard deviation.",
