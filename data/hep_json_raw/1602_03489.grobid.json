Astronomical evidence for the existence of dark matter ranges from galactic to cosmological scales [2][3][4]. However, its exact composition remains unknown. WIMPs arise in many extensions of the Standard Model of particle physics and are expected to have a small coupling to ordinary matter [5].

A WIMP interaction in the detector gives a low energy nuclear recoil ( < \u223c 100 keV), producing prompt scintillation light (S1) and ionization electrons. An applied electric field (180 V/cm between the cathode and gate electrodes) drifts the electrons upwards into the gaseous phase of the detector, where they produce electroluminescence (S2). Photons are detected by two arrays of photomultiplier tubes (PMTs). The difference in arrival time between the S1 and S2 signals gives the depth of the interaction, and the (x, y) position is found from the localization of the S2 in the top PMT array. The ability to reconstruct positions of interactions in three dimensions allows fiducialization of the active volume, avoiding higher background regions near the detector walls and enabling rejection of multiple scatters. Electronic recoils (ER) are distinguished from nuclear recoil (NR) interactions by the ratio of the charge (S2) and scintillation (S1) signals.",

After collecting these data, a low energy NR calibration [8] was performed with a DD neutron generator. This allows the charge and light response to be evaluated down to 1.1 keV, below the 3 keV recoil energy cut-off imposed in the original analysis. In addition, high statistics ER calibration data were acquired with a tritium source dissolved in the active liquid xenon [9], improving the characterization of the detector response to low energy ER interactions. A further 10 live days of WIMP search data were added taking the exposure up to 95 live days (1.4\u00d710 4 kg\u2022days). Other improvements were made to the background model, vertex reconstruction, and event selection. These improvements motivated a reanalysis of the 2013 data, enhancing the sensitivity of the LUX experiment [10]. The SI result is compatible with the background-only hypothesis and sets a 90% confidence upper limit on the WIMP-nucleon cross section of 5.6\u00d710 \u221246 cm 2 at a WIMP mass of 33 GeV/c 2 . Now we use the reanalysed data to also set limits on the spin-dependent (SD) WIMP-proton and WIMP-neutron scattering cross sections.",

For the non-relativistic velocities of galactic WIMPs, the scattering is mostly coherent across the whole nucleus. For isospin-conserving interactions, this leads to an enhancement of the scalar (spin-independent) interaction proportional to A 2 . For the SD case there is cancellation between the spins of nucleon pairs so the A 2 enhancement is not present. Therefore, nuclei with even numbers of protons and neutrons have almost zero nuclear spin, giving a negligible contribution to the SD interaction. However, models exist where the SI interaction is suppressed [15], making it essential to search for the SD interaction, and moreover, xenon is sensitive to this interaction because it contains isotopes with non-zero spin.",

The calculation used here is from Klos et al. [17]. It includes the largest number of states and allowed configurations compared to previous theoretical treatments in the literature. The order of the experimentally-measured nuclear energy levels in xenon is reproduced well. In addition, the Klos et al. result uses a chiral effective field theory treatment of the nuclear interactions including two-body currents. These structure functions are an update of those in Ref. [19]. Within the recoil energy range of interest, changes to the neutron-only structure function are small: at most 5% for 129 Xe, and a maximum 20% increase for 131 Xe. For proton-only the structure function is smaller than previously: as the recoil energy increases the difference in 129 Xe rises to 30% and in 131 Xe to 50%. We also compare to the structure function calculation of Ressell and Dean with the Bonn A nucleon-nucleon potential [20], which has been extensively used in previous SD results.

Another important background comes from radon daughter decays on the PTFE walls of the TPC, with the tail of the distribution in reconstructed radius extending into the fiducial volume [23]. In these \"wall events\" some electrons are lost, resulting in a reduced S2 signal, so that many events lie below the signal band in S2/S1.

The shape of the recoil spectrum produced by a SD neutron-only interaction is very similar to that from a SI one. The SD proton interaction produces a somewhat harder recoil spectrum at all WIMP masses, with the effect growing for heavier WIMPs; at 20 TeV the SD proton-only has 28% of recoils between 25 and 50 keV, compared to 20% for SI. The signal PDF for a given WIMP mass is evaluated by fitting the yield of single scatters from the DD-neutron calibration in S2 and S1 [8]. Systematic uncertainties from the DD neutron calibration are included in this fit. Contributions from the different isotopes are accounted for by adding their differential event rates. Confidence intervals are set with a profile likelihood ratio (PLR) in four variables: S1, S2, radius, and height. All of these variables are useful for discriminating signal from background. Further detail on the analysis can be found in Refs. [10,24], including the application of a power constraint at the median sensitivity so as not to benefit from background fluctuations. The observed events are consistent with the expectation from background only.",

Typically only the most sensitive channel of the two cross sections is shown. In this case the limits in the a p \u2212 a n plane can be found following the method detailed in Ref. [43], which is a good approximation if a p a n or vice-versa. This result improves the constraint on a n over previous experiments. The lines are parts of elongated ellipses and the orientation depends on the sensitivity to both a p and a n . The angle of the ellipse for LUX and XENON100 is not the same due to differences in the spin structure functions used and the energy scale in the analysis (which affects the signal spectrum). XENON100 also had slightly different abundances of 129 Xe and 131 Xe, due to the addition of isotopically modified xenon. This plot also emphasises the complementarity between the different detector materials.",

We also improve the constraints on the possible values of the couplings a p and a n , complementary to experiments that are more sensitive to the proton than the neutron coupling. The sensitivity to both proton and neutron-only coupling will be improved greatly with future large-scale experiments with xenon targets such as LZ [39].",
