SuperB is a flavour factory capable of performing precision measurements and searches for rare and forbidden decays of B u,d,s , D, \u03c4 and \u03a5 (nS) particles. These results can be used to test fundamental symmetries and expectations of the Standard Model, and to constrain many different hypothesised types of new physics. In some cases these measurements can be used to place constraints on the existence of light dark matter and light Higgs particles with masses below 10 GeV/c 2 . The potential impact of the measurements that will be made by SuperB on the field of high energy physics is also discussed in the context of data taken at both high energy in the region around the \u03a5 (4S), and near charm threshold.",

            "text": "This topical review discusses the potential impact of high luminosity e + e \u2212 collider experiments, the so-called Super Flavour Factories, on our understanding of high energy physics. In particular this review will focus on the potential of one of these facilities; the SuperB project. This experiment will record billions of B, D, and \u03c4 decays at various center of mass energies ranging between the \u03c8(3770) and \u03a5 (6S) in order to search for signs of physics beyond the Standard Model of Particle Physics (SM) and to perform precision measurements of the SM. There are two Super Flavour Factories, one called Belle II which is being constructed at KEK in Japan, and the other called SuperB being built in Italy. The aim of Belle II is to integrate 50 ab \u22121 of data at a center of mass energy corresponding to the \u03a5 (4S) resonance, while SuperB aims to integrate 75 ab \u22121 of data at that energy. There are several important differences between these two experiments (i) the electron beam at SuperB will be polarised, enabling superior performance in the study of \u03c4 leptons and other important precision tests of the SM such as the measurement of the weak mixing angle via sin 2 \u03b8 W and (ii) SuperB will have a dedicated run at the \u03c8(3770) which corresponds to the charm production threshold. Before discussing the implications of the many measurements that will be possible at SuperB, and thus the benefits of the additional features of SuperB over Belle II, it is prudent to take a brief look at history (Section 1.1), and our understanding of current popular expectations of physics beyond the SM, which is often referred to a 'new physics' (NP) in the literature (Section 1.2). Section 1.3 provides an outline of the rest of the review. Detailed reviews of the physics programmes of SuperB and Belle II can be found in Refs. [1] and [2].",

Such observables for a rare or suppressed decay can be sensitive probes of NP. Decay channels related to this type of measurement are often referred to as golden modes in the context of NP searches. The second type of measurement motivating the SuperB experiment are precision CKM or SM measurements, for example the precision measurement of sin 2 \u03b8 W . These measurements have a dual purpose, to provide a precision determination of SM parameters, and in turn to constrain possible NP scenarios.",

The sub-set of phenomena relating to the change of one type of quark or lepton into another type of quark or lepton is referred to as flavour physics. Phenomena pertaining to flavour interactions in quarks are described by the 3 \u00d7 3 Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) quark mixing matrix, which encompasses the quark-mixing mechanism postulated by Cabibbo in 1963 [3] with the description of CP violation introduced by Kobayashi and Maskawa in 1973 [4]. In the SM Lagrangian transitions of up-type (q u ) and down-type (q d ) quarks are mediated by the exchange of a W boson via q u V ij q d , where V ij represents the CKM matrix with the indices i and j corresponding to the quarks.

This description of the CKM matrix is the convention of Wolfenstein [5]. When working with the large data samples expected at the next generation of experiments, the above matrix is not expanded to sufficient orders in \u03bb, and one obtains a convention dependent solution. The Buras parameterisation of the CKM matrix provides a convenient framework to use at higher orders [6,7]. SuperB is able to probe in detail many aspects of the CKM matrix by making a number of redundant measurements. There is an equivalent formalism to describe neutrino mixing that is currently being explored by a number of experiments including Daya Bay, Super Kamiokande, and T2K. These measurements are related to elements in a 3\u00d73 mixing matrix describing neutrino mixing (for example see the review by B. Kayser in Ref [8]). To date there is no evidence for charged lepton flavour violation. SuperB will be able to make significant advances in the search for charged lepton flavour violation in \u03c4 decays, so transitions from the third, to the second or first generations of charged leptons (see Section 3).",

This work was completed in an era before the concept of quarks was accepted as a given fact, and the concept of mixing was expressed in terms of currents, that would have corresponded to interactions between the u, d, and s quarks in today's terminology. Shortly after this significant step forward, it was realised that attempts to reconcile theory and measurement for the branching fraction of K 0 L \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 decays required the introduction of a fourth quark via the GIM mechanism [9]. The discovery of the J/\u03c8 particle was the confirmation that this fourth quark existed, and we now refer to this as the charm quark. A repeat of this problem was encountered in the study of B 0 \u2212 B 0 mixing by the ARGUS experiment. The amplitude for B 0 \u2212 B 0 mixing is dominated by transitions involving the top quark, thus theorists were able to make predictions of the top quark mass based on the experimental knowledge of this mixing observable. It is interesting to note that in both cases (i) the study of a rare kaon decay, leading to the discovery of the charm quark, and (ii) the use of experimental constraints on B 0 \u2212 B 0 mixing to discover the top quark, one is using a low energy flavour changing process to place stringent constraints on a much higher energy phenomenon. Measurements of flavour changing processes such as the GIM mechanism and mixing in B 0 B 0 decays have shaped our understanding of the SM.",

Having introduced the SM Higgs to the model, further corrections are required in order to cope with Higgs self coupling interactions. This motivates the search for a richer texture of NP beyond just identifying a SM Higgs candidate. If it turned out that the Higgs did not exist, then something else would have to be introduced into the model in order to address the issues that the Higgs particle was originally postulated for. There is a wide range of scenarios of physics beyond the SM that have been postulated. Many of these scenarios are derived from some higher theory such as M-Theory or subsets such as SUSY, others introduce a variety of different concepts, for example extra spatial dimensions, additional generations of fermions, and additional Higgs particles. These models of new physics are obtained by adding new terms to the SM Lagrangian, and then using existing constraints from experiments to evaluate if such an addition is consistent with nature or not. Some of the most stringent constraints that have guided theorists in the construction of the SM are so-called flavour changing neutral currents (FCNC), and in many cases such constraints are being used to guide the development of theories beyond the SM.",

Interpretation of the results, in comparison with both SM expectations, and those of the NP scenario can be used to constrain the parameter space of the NP model. One of the parameters that enters into this process is the energy scale for the new physics \u039b N P (e.g. the particle mass in the case of the charm and top quarks discussed previously). Thus just as flavour changing processes have provided stringent constraints for theorists in understanding and constructing the SM, any theory of physics that goes beyond the scope of the SM will also be strongly constrained by measurements of flavour changing transitions. Hence model builders will be able to partially reconstruct the new physics Lagrangian using the results of SuperB and other flavour experiments. In particular if there are mixing matrices between sets of new particles introduced into the theory, then in general the off-diagonal complex elements may be constrained by rare decays probed in flavour physics experiments.",

Spectroscopy measurements in terms of direct searches of unknown particles related to new physics (Section 7) is also reviewed. Section 8 briefly mentions some of the other measurements that can be made at Super Flavour Factories. Estimated improvements in the field of Lattice QCD and subsequent impact on the SuperB physics programme are discussed in Ref. [1]. Thus far the LHC experiments have not found evidence for the SM Higgs or any physics beyond the SM. The exclusions obtained using the first few years of data taking suggest that flavour observables can, and will, play an important role in elucidating nature in the coming years. It is important to globally combine information from all possible measurements together in order to optimally decode the signatures of physics beyond the SM. Section 9 reviews the measurements to be made at SuperB in such a global context, highlighting inter-relations between different sets of measurements as a tool to elucidate generic behavior of new physics and of the SM.",

Any discoveries of new physics from LHCb, or indeed possible inconsistencies of measurement and SM expectations will be of direct interest to the SuperB physics programme. This is the case as, aside from FCNC and annihilation topologies, the difference between B u,d decays and B s decays is the choice of the light spectator quark, which does not drive the physics content of a particular decay. Any FCNC or annihilation topologies that do manifest signs of a deviation from the SM in B s decays also have parallels for B u,d decays, although the relative new physics couplings may in general be different from the B s case. While hadron collider experiments have the advantage of vast statistics over experiments at e + e \u2212 machines, there is a price paid in terms of triggering systems, backgrounds, and poor neutral reconstruction. Typically rare charged hadronic final states will be measured well in hadron machines, and hence good theoretical control of hadronic uncertainties may be required to interpret such results. Whereas experiments at e + e \u2212 will excel in final states containing neutrals, and in particular \u03bd s that would otherwise be challenging or impossible to study in a hadronic environment. Final states of this type are generally theoretically much cleaner that the hadronic ones best accessed in a hadron machine. Many of these latter decays are vital ingredients for constraining possible sources of NP. A proposal for a potential upgrade of LHCb is in preparation, and such an experiment could finish taking data as early as 2030 [15], a number of years after SuperB and Belle II are expected to have finished accumulating their nominal data sets.",

The reason for having a boosted center of mass frame is in order to facilitate the study of time-dependent CP violation in B and D decays, and this naturally results in a forward-backward asymmetry in the design of the detector. This requirement has a consequence that asymmetric beam energies are needed, with a boost factor of the centre of mass relative to the lab \u03b2\u03b3 = 0.23 at the \u03a5 (4S). While the baseline design for the machine also has a low boost factor for operation at the \u03c8(3770), it may be possible to take data at this energy with a with a boost factor \u03b2\u03b3 as large as 0. 91. If that were realisable, then this would open up the possibility of performing a number of quantum correlated time-dependent studies with charm decays as discussed in Section 5. The instantaneous luminosity of the accelerator at the \u03a5 (4S) [\u03c8(3770)] will be 10 36 [10 35 ]cm \u22122 s \u22121 , with bunch currents of a few amps in both the low and high energy rings (LER and HER).

Here \u03b2 * i is the beta function and i is the emittance at the interaction point (IP). The angle \u03b8 is the crossing angle of the two beams, so the \u03c3 z contribution vanishes for beams colliding head on, and the parameter f c is the frequency of collision of each bunch. There are two potential routes to increasing the luminosity of a circular collider (i) increase the number of electrons (which is related to the power required to run the machine), or (ii) decrease the transverse size of the bunches in the beam, i.e. decrease the emittance. The main driving force to increasing the luminosity of the SuperB accelerator relative to PEP II is to significantly reduce the emittance of the beam, and as a result to make the bunch sizes smaller than the previous generation of e + e \u2212 colliders. There is a second important improvement in the accelerator design related to the interaction region: In order to bring bunches of electrons and positrons into collision, one has to either have a complicated array of magnets to align an incoming e \u2212 bunch so that it collides head on with a e + bunch, or to have a small but finite crossing angle between the two beams. The former approach was adopted by the SLAC B Factory, and has the limitation that there would be a significant level of luminosity related beam backgrounds recorded in the SuperB detector that could obscure some of the rare signals under study if a similar approach was adopted for future machines. The traditional problem with the latter approach results from the fact that bunches of electrons and positrons are ellipsoidal in shape, and by bringing two bunches into collision at a finite angle, and the effective cross sectional area of the collision at the IP is reduced. It was realised by Pantaleo Raimondi that sextupole magnets positioned before and after the interaction region can be used to skew the transverse waists of incoming bunches with a finite crossing angle in such a way that they are pinched optimally at the point of collision. This collision scheme has been termed the 'crabbed waist' scheme, and it was successfully tested at LNF Frascati in 2009 (See [10] and references therein).",

Details of the intended scheme to be used in order to obtain a polarised electron beam can be found in Ref. [10].

            "text": "Working from the inner to outermost components, the SuperB detector consists of a Silicon Vertex Tracker (SVT) surrounded by a Drift Chamber (DCH), both of which are used to detect the passage of charged particles through the detector. The Particle Identification (PID) system is comprised of a next generation Detector of Internally Reflected Cherenkov radiation (FDIRC) which surrounds the DCH. There is also a forward PID system under investigation to provide particle identification over a larger solid angle than that covered by the FDIRC. Surrounding the PID system is an Electromagnetic Calorimeter (EMC) which is used primarily to provide measurements of photon and electron energies. All of the aforementioned components will be situated in a super-conducting solenoid magnet capable of producing a solenoidal magnetic field of 1.5T. This is the same solenoid magnet that was used for the BABAR experiment. The field strength for charm threshold running may be lower than 1.5T, and studies are ongoing in order to determine the strength required for signal reconstruction versus background suppression. The outermost part of the detector is the so-called Instrumented Flux Return (IFR) which is used to identify muons and K 0 L mesons. Figure 1, taken from Ref. [11], shows a schematic of the SuperB detector. The top half of the Figure illustrates the baseline detector design, while the bottom half shows various options such as forward PID system and backward calorimeter. The main components of the detector are described in more detail in the following (A more detailed discussion can be found in Ref. [11]). SVT: The SuperB SVT consists of two types of detector. The first is a highly segmented device close to the beam pipe (referred to as Layer 0), and the second is a BABAR-like multi-layer double sided silicon strip detector. There are several choices of technology for Layer 0, and the baseline choice for low luminosity operation of the machine (data taking during the first few years) is a double-sided silicon strip based detector with short strips at 45 \u2022 to the direction of the beam, with a stereo angle of 90 \u2022 between strips on both sides of the sensor. This iteration of Layer 0 will be at an average radius of 1.6cm from the IP. There are several Monolithic Active Pixel Sensor and and Hybrid Pixel Sensor technology options under investigation, all of which will be suitable for use in the high luminosity running that corresponds to nominal data taking. The amount of material in Layer 0 depends on the technology chosen, but is expected to be between 0.4 and 1.0% of a radiation length. The outer part of the SVT will consist of several layers of double sided strip sensors arranged in a configuration similar to the BABAR SVT [16]. The use of the SVT is not anticipated in the trigger, and triggers formed using information from the DCH will be required in order to read out the SVT. DCH: The SuperB drift chamber will be the primary sub-system for providing measurement information on tracks with momenta larger than \u223c 100 MeV/c. The DCH design for SuperB is similar to the BABAR one, with 40 layers of cells, the cross-section of each cell being 1cm 2 . Studies are underway to determine the optimal gas mixture to use for the DCH, and the overall layout, with either spherical or stepped end plates. The choice of gas mixture will be driven by the desire to minimize the overall occupancy of the sub detector, estimated to be 3.5%. There is also an ongoing effort to understand if it is possible to benefit from the use of cluster counting in order to improve the dE/dx resolution by a factor of two [17,18]. No experiment has yet managed to utilize this technique, so the potential use of cluster counting is considered an interesting option for improving the DCH performance beyond an acceptable design level. The DCH will provide fast trigger information for events with charged tracks in the final state. PID: A next generation Detector of Internally Reflected Cherenkov radiation (FDIRC) surrounds the DCH tracking volume, and is used to distinguish between different types of charged particle. The fused silica bars of the BABAR DIRC will be re-used in SuperB, and combined with a segmented fused silica focusing block system read out by semiconductor sensors. This next generation DIRC will have superior particle identification performance and tolerance to backgrounds than the first generation BABAR DIRC. The reason for replacing the water based focusing system with a fused silica one is to produce a radiation hard device that has a much smaller instrumented area than the BABAR DIRC, in order to be able to cope with increased levels of backgrounds that are expected at SuperB. There is an option for a forward PID system, which is motivated by the desire to increase the angular coverage of the PID system and there are several technologies under study for a potential device. The additional material required to implement such a system would not significantly degrade the performance of the calorimeter end-cap.",

The end-cap part of the calorimeter needs to be replaced with a faster and more highly segmented solution than that used for BABAR.

The baseline technology chosen for the high rate environment expected at SuperB is based on wavelength shifting scintillating fibres that are read out by avalanche pixel photo-diodes operating in Geiger mode. Studies are ongoing in order to determine the amount of iron required for optimal muon identification performance at SuperB. It was recognised that there was insufficient material used at BABAR to optimally detect muons, and it is intended that more material will be used in the SuperB IFR.

With polarised electrons, one can reconstruct the \u03c4 helicity distribution and thus use information on the polarised \u03c4 final states to suppress backgrounds.

If neutrino oscillations are the sole source of charged lepton number violation, then it is unlikely that any experiment would be able to reach the required sensitivities to probe such effects in the foreseeable future. Given that both quark and neutrino flavour numbers are already known to be violated at a small level, it is reasonable to assume that the corresponding scenario could also be true in the charged lepton sector. In fact many scenarios of physics beyond the SM allow for large enhancements of charged LFV, and as in the case of the neutrino sector affecting expectations in the charged lepton sector, many models of charged LFV are dependent also on the neutrino mixing parameters. In order to full determine the underlying nature of any NP affecting the lepton sector one will have to combine results from both \u03c4 and \u00b5 decay studies with results from the neutrino sector.",

Tests of LFV transitions from the second to first generation can be performed by searching for the decay \u00b5 \u2192 e\u03b3, or through searches for \u00b5 \u2192 e conversion in the presence of nuclear material. The MEG experiment at the Paul Scherrer Institut (PSI) in Switzerland is searching for \u00b5 \u2192 e\u03b3 transitions [21], and the most precise constraint on \u00b5 \u2192 e conversion comes from the Sindrum II experiment [22], which was also based at PSI. Two new \u00b5 \u2192 e conversion experiments, COMET and PRISM, are being planned. Searches for charged LFV using \u03c4 decays focus on transitions from the third to the first and second generations of charged leptons. There are a number of different models of NP that generally predict which set of measurements will provide the most stringent constraints on charged LFV. While these models are a useful guide to follow, one should remember that historically in the neutrino sector, oscillation results have often been contrary to the most popular scenarios initially proposed, and secondly it is not simply good enough to observe LFV in one physical process. In order to understand the structure of NP in a detailed way, one needs to over constrain couplings related to LFV transitions, and hence to study the full set of possible lepton flavor transitions. SuperB is able to contribute to this area by searching for charged LFV in the decay of \u03c4 leptons. The combination of results from Super Flavour Factories with those from MEG and future \u00b5 \u2192 e conversion experiments, will provide a powerful set of constraints on the sets of charged LFV transitions.",

The virtual W boson subsequently decays into either a hadronic state or a lepton-neutrino pair. A Lepton Flavour Violating (LFV) decay involves the direct transition of the initial \u03c4 to a final state devoid of a neutrino.

However the SM expectations for such a LFV branching fraction is well beyond current experimental reach, for example the branching fraction for \u03c4 \u2192 \u00b5\u03b3 or \u00b5 \u2192 e\u03b3 < 10 \u221240 [23], where current knowledge of neutrino mixing places this limit closer to \u223c 10 \u221254 . In many popular scenarios of new physics these LFV branching fractions can be enhanced to the level of 10 \u22129 [24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38], for example by introduction loop contributions containing sparticles, where experimental bounds limit the parameter space of the models. The \u03b3 and 3 decays are golden channels for SuperB and the experimental reach for these modes is given in Table 2, where the results from BABAR and Belle come from Refs. [39,40,41,42]. In 75 ab \u22121 of data collected at the \u03a5 (4S) SuperB expects to record 70 \u00d7 10 9 \u03c4 leptons pairs. A further \u223c 1.2 \u00d7 10 9 \u03c4 pairs should be accumulated during the 500 fb \u22121 run at charm threshold. As one can see, the experimental sensitivity of these golden modes will be able to constrain NP models between one and two orders of magnitude better than current bounds, and interpretation of limits from data in the context of such models is discussed in Section 3.1. 1. The expected limits achievable by Belle II are slightly worse than those indicated for SuperB for two reasons, firstly Belle II will accumulate slightly less data than SuperB, and secondly the electron beam will be longitudinally polarised in SuperB, introducing an additional kinematic variable: the polarisation of the \u03c4 . The utilisation of this information when analysing data will provide SuperB with an additional variable to suppress background relative to the signal that is not available at other proposed or existing experiments.",

Given that the interpretation of LFV is highly model dependent, one needs to identify realistic benchmark models to test using data, and a number of observables that can be used to distinguish between the benchmarks. A lot of work has been done in this area, which include CMSSM and NUHM SUSY as specific variants of a more generalised SUSY model, as well as little Higgs models (LTH) and SUSY GUT models [24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38]. By piecing together different experimental observations one can distinguish between different types of model. For example the channel \u03c4 \u00b1 \u2192 \u00b1 \u03b3 can be significantly enhanced in SUSY based models relative to \u00b1 \u2213 \u00b1 , whereas \u03c4 \u00b1 \u2192 \u00b1 \u2213 \u00b1 can have a corresponding enhancement in LTH models relative to \u00b1 \u03b3. Hence a measurement of the ratio of the rates of these two channels could be used to distinguish between these sets of models. A recent analysis of the correlation between the \u00b5\u03b3 and 3\u00b5 branching fractions (shown in Figure 2) for Little Higgs models with T parity can be found in Ref. [44]. SuperB will be able to exclude all but the bottom left quadrant of the phase space shown in the Figure. Two examples of how results from SuperB and other experiments can be combined are given in the following. If one considers the SU (5) \u00d7 T model of Ref. [45], there is a definite prediction that lepton flavour violation in the MSW sector arises from charged leptons and that \u03bd's only mix. Other models can be built where this is not the case. This model also has well defined predictions for CP violation in B and D decays. Hence it is important to make as complete a set of measurements as possible in the charged lepton and quark sectors, and consider the relationship between such measurements and the \u03bd sector to verify or refute this prediction. Similarly in the model of Antusch et al. [30], the rates of \u03c4 \u00b1 \u2192 \u00b1 \u03b3, \u00b5 \u2192 e\u03b3, and the neutrino mixing parameter sin \u03b8 13 are correlated, once again highlighting the need for a global approach to interpreting results. The recent \u03bd e appearance result from the T2K experiment [46] is an important step forward in neutrino physics, and future updates of that result will be of interest when considering possible new physics scenarios in the context of charged lepton flavour violation. If \u03b8 13 turns out to be large as currently suggested by data, then according to this model SuperB should not see \u03c4 \u2192 \u00b5\u03b3. The corollary of this is that if one were to observe a large signal for this channel, then this model would be ruled out.",

The reason for this is that both matter and antimatter have slightly different cross sections for interaction within the detector, which is constructed entirely of matter. A detailed understanding of this difference is straightforward and can be modeled in simulation. Another way to understand the magnitude of such a matter-antimatter asymmetry effect is to use a calibration sample of data. The advantage of this is that one can remove reliance of these important measurements on any simulation, and this route has been taken with existing searches for CP violation. It will be possible for SuperB to significantly improve upon the precision of CP violation searches in \u03c4 decays. In the case of the \u03c4 \u00b1 \u2192 K 0 S \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03bd decay, where there is an intrinsic CP asymmetry resulting from kaons in the final state, SuperB should be able to reduce current upper limits to the level where this SM background effect becomes measurable.

Indeed the existing experiments are approaching that sensitivity now, and the BABAR result of almost 3\u03c3 deviation from the SM motivates higher statistics searches.

With a polarised electron beam at SuperB one will be able to measure \u2206a \u00b5 to a statistical precision of 2.4 \u00d7 10 \u22126 from e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 transitions [1].",

It is true that the CKM mechanism has been verified at the 10% level, resulting the Kobayashi and Maskawa being awarded the Nobel Prize for physics in 2008 for their innovative work on a three generation quark mixing matrix to introduce CP violation into the SM. However one should not overlook the fact that new possibilities present themselves with one hundred times more data than existing experiments. SuperB will accumulate 75 \u00d7 10 9 neutral and charged B mesons in a data sample of 75 ab \u22121 , compared with 0.4 \u2212 1.0 \u00d7 10 9 accumulated by BABAR and Belle. With this increase in data it will be possible to perform a % level test of the CKM mechanism, and substantially improve a number of constraints on NP. The LHCb experiment will make a number of important measurements in the coming years, however as previously mentioned there are complementary advantages (and disadvantages) for experiments operating in e + e \u2212 environments versus hadronic ones that mean LHCb is complementary to SuperB, as opposed to a natural competitor. The true strength of these two experimental programmes comes when one combines the total set of observables that they will be able to measure. Here we concentrate on the contributions that SuperB will make to understanding new physics. One should also note that there are a number of issues that have recently been raised with regard to existing measurements of B decays that need to be explored in greater detail, as these may already be indications of problems with the SM: sin 2\u03b2: The measured value of this quantity from B meson decays to final states including a neutral kaon and charmonium (cc) is 3.2\u03c3 from the SM preferred value as highlighted in Ref.

In this scenario it is possible to use a branching fraction measurement to indirectly constrain the m H + \u2212tan \u03b2 plane.

Recently a number of additional asymmetries have been added to the list, for example see [72]. The theoretical issues associated with interpretation of inclusive and exclusive measurements are different, so if a deviation from the SM were to be found one would want to confirm that the two types of measurement (inclusive and exclusive) both exhibited this behavior in order to identify the underlying cause.

These are discussed in detail in Ref. [7]. Collectively the measured differences in the antisymmetric CP asymmetry, parameterised by S, in penguin decays and the benchmark B 0 \u2192 J\u03c8K S channel are known as \u2206S measurements. In addition to the SM penguin amplitude new heavy particles could contribute additional amplitudes to these final states, and the interference between SM and NP contributions could be detectable as an observable deviation from the tree sin 2\u03b2 value. More recently however the focus of these measurements has been extended to compare the tree measurement of sin 2\u03b2 against the inferred indirect constraint on this parameter. Thus this class of time-dependent CP violation mode serves as a set of sensitive interferometers for NP contributions from both tree and loop amplitudes. The modes under study, and corresponding theoretical and experimental sensitivities achievable are listed in Table 3 (reproduced from Ref. [1]). The channels are grouped into common physical final states: b \u2192 ccs charmonium decays, b \u2192 s penguin dominated decays, and b \u2192 d penguin dominated decays. While it is also possible to measure direct CP asymmetries in a large number of modes at SuperB, in general these are of limited use in terms of constraining theory. One exception is the CP asymmetry in b \u2192 s\u03b3 decays discussed above. The fundamental problem is that many of these measured observables are not theoretically clean, thus it is difficult to translate a direct CP measurement into an unambiguous constraint on a SM parameter. This is the B physics analog of the issue associated with interpreting the measurement of direct CP violation in kaon decays, / , beyond establishing that such an effect exists, which in itself was an important goal. It may be possible to combine many Charmless B decay modes to test the SM using direct CP asymmetries, however such tests will probably never be as clean a set of observables as some of the timedependent CP asymmetries discussed previously. A prime example of this situation can be seen in terms of the difference between the direct CP asymmetry measurements in B \u2192 K\u03c0 decays. Some authors have advocated that the discrepancy is clear evidence for NP, however over the last few years there have been a number of SM-based theoretical calculations that are able to explain this phenomenon. For this reason it is unlikely that direct CP violation measurements in Charmless hadronic B decays will play a leading role in future experiments. In Ref. [81] Gronau proposed a sum rule that could be used to correlate the measured asymmetries in K\u03c0 decays.",

In addition, the increased knowledge of branching fractions obtained via measurements at e + e \u2212 facilities will help improve the precision of absolute rates of B s decay modes, as LHCb reports branching ratio measurements, as opposed to branching fractions and will be limited by the absolute results given in the PDG for the normalisation modes used.

The other B meson in the final state can be used to provide sufficient kinematic information to help reduce the background level.

The \u03a5 (4S) data results from D mesons being produced from e + e \u2212 continuum events, where the cross-section for cc is comparable to that for bb. In general one reconstructs tagged D mesons from a D * \u2192 D\u03c0 s transition where \u03c0 s denotes a slow (low-momentum) pion. The advantage of studying charm in SuperB at this energy is the vast data sample that can be collected in a clean environment where one expects to accumulate 90 \u00d7 10 9 D 0 meson pairs in 75 ab \u22121 of data. The drawback is that the data, while clean, are not background free, and for example one must restrict the momentum range of D mesons to exclude events originating from B decay. In some measurements systematic uncertainties from background may be a critical issue, and for these having access to data collected at the \u03c8(3770) resonance may provide a distinct advantage. In addition to having smaller background, neutral D meson pairs produced at charm threshold are quantum correlated where one always has a D 0 and a D 0 until one of the mesons decays. In essence one can repeat the B factory experiment at the \u03a5 (4S), with a D factory experiment at charm threshold. In order to exploit the full potential of the quantum correlated neutral meson pair one needs to have a boosted centre of mass system, and this may be achievable with \u03b2\u03b3 up to 0.91 at SuperB. The baseline boost for SuperB is currently somewhat smaller than this value. The drawback of running at charm threshold, with respect to the \u03a5 (4S), will be that the accumulated luminosity at the \u03c8(3770) is expected to only be of the order of 500 fb \u22121 . This will result in only \u223c 1.8 \u00d7 10 9 D meson pairs being produced, however these data are extremely clean, and kinematics of the initial state e + e \u2212 pair and the 'other' D meson in the event can be used to essentially select samples of almost pure D mesons. A number of observables measured using the data collected in a few months at the \u03c8(3770) will be competitive with results from the \u03a5 (4S) sample accumulated over the lifetime of SuperB, and some will help control systematic uncertainties in measurements made using \u03a5 (4S) data at Belle II and SuperB, and also help reduce uncertainties for the corresponding measurements at LHCb. Many observables can be accessed using both samples of data, and are discussed according to topic in the following.",

While both neutral B and K mesons have been studied in detail, one should recall that these involve flavour changing transitions of down type quarks. The study of mixing and CP violation in the charm sector corresponds to the study of an up-type quark, where any large manifestation of CP violation would constitute a sign of NP. It should also be noted that as the amount of data accumulated increase, additional observables will become accessible to experimentalists. An example of this very situation can be seen in terms of time-dependent CP asymmetry measurements, discussed in Section 5. 2. Neutral D mesons mixing can be described by a Hamiltonian consisting of a 2 \u00d7 2 matrix of elements given by M +i\u0393/2, where M and \u0393 are themselves 2\u00d72 matrices [90].

The dominant contribution to these measurements currently comes from the time-dependent Dalitz Plot (DP) analysis of D 0 \u2192 K 0 S h + h \u2212 final states as one is able to determine the value of \u03b4 f as a function of position in the DP, and hence extract x D and y D directly for this mode. The other channels measure x D and y D up to a rotation corresponding to the strong phase measured in the final state according to Eq. (16). There is an intrinsic limit to the precision of any measurement using the K 0 S h + h \u2212 final state that comes from the DP model used for the decay. It will be possible to control this contribution to a charm mixing analysis by performing a detailed study of this decay using data collected at charm threshold (see Section 5.4). Table 4 summarises the expected precisions obtainable on mixing parameters using existing methods and data from SuperB. The impact of charm threshold running on the determination of these parameters is clearly evident. On inclusion of the improved DP information one will be able to halve the total uncertainty on x D and reduce the uncertainty on y D by 30% and Figure 6 shows the different constraints obtainable using all data from SuperB. More importantly these results will change from being systematically to statistically limited, allowing for further improvements. The SuperB results from threshold running will impact upon the ultimate precision of mixing parameters determined by the Belle II and LHCb experiments. It will also be possible to place model dependent constraints on |q/p| and the phase of charm mixing with precisions better than 1 \u2212 2% and 1.4 \u2022 , respectively.",

The motivation and formalism for doing so has been discussed recently in Ref. [7] in the context of testing the cu unitarity triangle. An important issue to raise is that in order to understand the phenomenology of CP violation one has to choose a convention for the four parameters of the CKM matrix, and the order to which one expands the matrix elements in terms of this basis. Until recently the Wolfenstein parameterisation of the CKM matrix [5] has been used by default. Here the four expansion parameters of the matrix are \u03bb = sin \u03b8 c \u223c 0.22, A, \u03c1 and \u03b7, and the description of the matrix has been given up to O(\u03bb 3 ) in Eq. 2. An alternative parameterisation using the same four parameters has been proposed by Buras et al. in Ref. [6] which has the advantage that the unitarity triangle is unitary to any order of the expansion in terms of \u03bb. At O(\u03bb 3 ), both conventions are equivalent, however in the charm sector one needs to consider additional terms, to at least O(\u03bb 5 ), to understand the CKM structure and CP violation potential of charm decays.

While hadron experiments may provide input to help solve this problem one will require data from a Super Flavour Factory to complete the picture. It has been estimated that it will be possible to constrain \u03b2 c,eff to a precision of 1 \u2022 at SuperB before taking into account penguin contributions [7] on combining data from threshold and the \u03a5 (4S). As \u03b2 c is estimated to be \u223c 0.035 \u2022 , SuperB will be able to constrain large NP effects in time-dependent CP asymmetry measurements in charm decays, but will lack the precision to perform a direct test of the SM. Nonetheless, it will be important to verify that \u03b2 c,eff is consistent with zero. One should also note that time-dependent measurements will also be able to provide model dependent constraints on |q/p|, and so one can search for both direct and indirect CP violation, in addition to measuring the phase of neutral D meson mixing. Some of the systematic uncertainties in time-dependent CP asymmetry measurements made using data collected at the \u03c8(3770) resonance will be different from those at the \u03a5 (4S).

Such a measurement at SuperB would complement the corresponding studies performed in B and \u03a5 decays. In order to perform such an analysis one would have to use data collected at charm threshold, so that the kinematics of the final state D 0 \u2192 \u03bd\u03bd can be constrained by measurement of the recoil D meson and knowledge of the initial e + e \u2212 kinematics in the decay chain e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c8(3770) \u2192 D 0 D 0 . Unlike B decays where the sum of branching fractions for fully reconstructed final states is a few percent, here a D recoil analysis would utilise over half of the available final state D decays. With a total of 1.8 \u00d7 10 9 D mesons produced at threshold it is feasible to assume that SuperB will be able to perform a detailed search for both of these decays.

It is possible to perform a precise test of CP T using D 0 D 0 pairs from the data sample collected at \u03c8(3770), where both D mesons decay into a semi-leptonic final state (e.g. see [101]).

Existing measurements are compatible with CP T being an exact symmetry, however it is interesting to note that the BABAR experiment reported a 2.8\u03c3 deviation from CP T conservation when studying a large sample of di-lepton events as a function of sidereal time [56].

The power of identifying an almost pure sample of charm mesons at threshold to analyse can be seen by comparing the precision of many CLEO-c results to those from the B Factories.

One such example is the D \u2192 K S \u03c0\u03c0 final state [103], which feeds into both the measurement of \u03b3 via the GGSZ method and traditional charm mixing analyses as discussed in Section 5.1. There is an intrinsic model uncertainty associated with the use of this decay, which arises from the amplitudes considered in the DP model and thus the values of strong phases extracted as a function of the DP. CLEO-c have shown that one can use quantum correlated D mesons produced at the \u03c8(3770) in order to perform a measurement of the strong phase in K S \u03c0\u03c0 decays as a function of position in the DP [104]. At the time this result came out, it was used to halve the model uncertainty on \u03b3 for the B factory results. In order for the GGSZ method to remain a viable approach for the measurement of \u03b3 in the Super Flavour Factory era, one will need an improved measurement of the Dalitz model for K S \u03c0\u03c0 decays. As mentioned in Section 5.1, the inclusion of this result will significantly impact the measurements of charm mixing parameters at SuperB, Belle II and LHCb, and make future studies of these parameters meaningful. A number of other potential uses of charm decays to quantum correlated final states are under investigation within the SuperB Collaboration.",

The set of measurements comparing ratios of branching fractions, corrected for the lepton mass-difference therefore provides a measure of the lepton coupling, and any deviation from a common value could indicate a violation of LU. As the lighter leptons can undergo bremsstrahlung, it is necessary to ensure that radiative effects are properly accounted for when performing such measurements. The results of recent tests of LU in \u03a5 (1S) decays provides a test a the percent level [108]. Tests at the sub-per mille level using \u03c4 decays have also been reported [109].",

The basis of naturalness is to assume that couplings in a model of nature are not fine tuned to small values, but may take arbitrary values as large as O(1). Such arguments are used set a scale of electroweak symmetry breaking at 1TeV. On considering the historical development of the SM as described in Section 1.1, it is also possible to use flavour changing processes to probe higher energies via the contribution of virtual effects to the total amplitude of a rare process. In the case of B 0 -B 0 mixing a system with an energy of 5.28 GeV was used to detect the presence of the top quark, which is now known to have a mass of 172 \u00b1 0.9 \u00b1 1.3 GeV /c 2 [8]. One can perform a similar exercise to constrain possible a NP energy scale \u039b N P , again using rare decays and flavour changing processes. Such constraints are model dependent, and depending on the model, the scale of new physics can be placed between 10 and 100TeV. An energy scale of 1TeV or below can only be obtained by setting flavour parameters in the NP sector to zero. Such models are known as Minimal Flavour Violation (MFV) models. The sources of CPV in a MFV model are the same Yukawa couplings from the Higgs sector that result in the CKM matrix. Given that there is a rich texture in nature related to the flavour changing processes, for both quarks and neutrinos, it may seem improbable that any complex NP sector, such as SUSY would be completely flavour blind, with all new CP violating phases arbitrarily set to zero. Thus there is a tension between well motivated naturalness arguments giving an energy scale of 1TeV for the electroweak symmetry breaking, and our expectation that new physics might have a rich texture related to flavour changing processes in analogy with what we have observed so far in the SM. Experimental input is required in order to move forward on both the high-energy and flavour fronts. At the time of writing this report, there has been no significant signature for NP encountered at the LHC in order to guide this exploration. The lack of a discovery has already started to have ramifications for flavour blind scenarios of NP.",

The phenomenology that is possible using data from SuperB is far richer in terms of understanding flavour couplings, than is possible at the energy frontier machines, whereas the latter excel when it comes to direct probes of NP. Given the centre of mass at SuperB is of the order of either 3.8 or 10.6 GeV, it is not possible to directly produce high energy particles in this experiment, however it should be noted that the indirect sensitivity of many processes goes up to \u223c 100 TeV. In contrast the LHC is capable of directly probing up to energies of \u223c 1 TeV. To complement its indirect search capability, SuperB will be able to make direct searches for light Higgs and Dark Matter particles (with masses below 10 GeV/c 2 ) that would be unobservable at the LHC.

One can combine inclusive measurements of the branching fractions of b \u2192 s\u03b3 and b \u2192 s + \u2212 with the direct CP asymmetry in b \u2192 s\u03b3 decays at SuperB to constrain the complex MI parameter (\u03b4 23 ) LR as discussed in Refs [111,112]. If one assumes squark and gluino masses are similar, then one can relate the magnitude of this coupling to the SUSY mass scale in a straight forward way as shown in Figure 7. Light SUSY has been ruled out by the LHC, which as one can see from the figure, implies a non-trivial value for (\u03b4 23 ) LR . The LHC should be able to probe up to masses of a few TeV by the end of this decade. If \u039b N P is ultimately fixed to a given value by a direct discovery on this time-scale, the combination of flavour observables from SuperB can be used to make a precision measurement of the real and imaginary parts of (\u03b4 23 ) LR and teach us some of the details of the corresponding model. If however the LHC fails to find SUSY, the same combination of flavour observables places an orthogonal constraint on the (\u03b4 23 ) LR \u2212 mg plane, and in effect would place an upper limit on \u039b N P . For example a 5% (\u03b4 23 ) LR constraint bounds \u039b N P \u2264 3.5TeV. In such a scenario, results from SuperB could be used as a guide the physics programme of the general purpose LHC upgrade experiments, in terms of data samples required to have sufficient energy reach for a direct discovery. This interplay requires both high energy, and high intensity inputs in order to obtain the maximal level of information to understand the model. One can typically access scales of \u039b N P \u223c 10TeV using flavour observables in this scenario. ",

On doing this they realised that CP violation could be naturally introduced into theoretical descriptions of particle physics. The experimental confirmation of this extended theory, i.e. the CKM mechanism, by the BABAR experiment at SLAC in the USA, and the Belle experiment at the KEK laboratory in Japan, resulted in Kobayashi and Maskawa being awarded a Nobel Prize in 2008. This experimental determination was the the completion of a set of direct tests of the CKM mechanism with a precision of about 10%. The tests were measurements of the angles \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3 of the unitarity triangle, and they were complemented by a number of indirect tests. This work established that the leading order contribution to CP violation in the quark sector of the SM is a result of the CKM matrix but can not rule out NP effects below this level. The observed amount of CP violation in the SM is not sufficient to describe the required matter-antimatter asymmetry in the Universe, motivating new sources of CP violation in quark or lepton sectors. Indeed there are a number of models that can accommodate generic NP contributions that would affect the SM picture of the Unitarity Triangle. Super Flavour Factories will be able to over constrain the CKM matrix through both direct and indirect measurements, to a precision of about 1% as indicated in Fig. 8 (from Ref. [1]). Trivial extensions of the SM that one can test in a straightforward way, includes SM4: models where a fourth generation of fermions are introduced to the SM. On doing this one introduces five new parameters to the CKM matrix, two of which are additional CP violating phases. The SuperB and Belle II experiments are the most versatile of all of the existing and proposed flavour physics experiments for performing such a test. Looking at current data, there are several tensions between measured observables at the level of 2.5\u03c3, and it is impossible to simultaneously bring all of these constraints into agreement with each other and the SM expectation [113,114]. These observables are sin 2\u03b2, |V ub |, and the measured branching fraction of the rare decay B \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd. Furthermore, there are discrepancies between inclusive and exclusive measurements of |V ub | and |V cb | that can only be investigated experimentally to a higher precision at a Super Flavour Factory. While LHCb is expected to improve the precision of our knowledge of sin 2\u03b2 from the current precision of 0.8 \u2022 to 0.5 \u2022 , unfortunately that experiment will not be able to study these other problematic observables as they are all final states containing a neutrino. Thus a Super Flavour Factory is needed to resolve if these discrepancies are a first manifestation of NP or simply the result of statistical fluctuations.",

Physics topics that will be studied at SuperB range from flavour changing quark interactions, and searches for new phenomena like charged lepton flavour violation and CP violation in the lepton sector, to searches for Dark Matter candidates and indirect searches for new particles at energy scales far beyond the reach of the Tevatron and the LHC. These topics cover many aspects of physics, and have implications in areas beyond particle physics. It is interesting to note that this conclusion holds true irrespective of the findings of SuperB: if no deviations from the Standard Model are found, the structure of the Lagrangian is strongly constrained, which is also the case if clear discoveries of new physics were to be made. In this sense SuperB is a discovery experiment \u2212 not necessarily discovery of new particles, but discovery of fragments of the underlying structure of the theory. Consequently, in addition to placing stringent constraints on the type of new physics that could be possible in nature, measurements from SuperB will be able to perform many precision tests of the Standard Model of particle physics.",

It is expected that SuperB will have recorded 75 fb \u22121 in five years of nominal data taking, corresponding to 75 billion B, 90 billion D, and 70 billion \u03c4 pairs for analysis. The sensitivities that one will be able to reach with such data samples can be as low as O(f ew \u00d7 10 \u221210 ) for clean processes. It is worth noting that there are also important measurements that will be made at SuperB that impact the physics reach of other experiments. Two examples of such a measurement is the strong phase as a function of position in the Dalitz plot for decays such as D 0 \u2192 K 0 S \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 that feed into D mixing and \u03b3 measurements, and the branching fraction of D 0 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3, which is required in order to disentangle long distance SM contributions from NP enhancements of D 0 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 . The precision CKM measurements that will be performed at SuperB can be used to open over-constrain the SM, and if one finds measurement consistent with theory, then this also provides the gateway for NP searches at other experiments. For example the rare kaon decay experiments searching for K \u2192 \u03c0\u03bd\u03bd will be able to use their results to test the SM, however if CKM uncertainties are reduced, one could improve the sensitivity of those channels to NP.
