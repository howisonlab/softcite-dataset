D meson final states such as K \u2212 \u03c0 + , which may arise from either a Cabibbo favored D 0 decay or a doubly Cabibbo suppressedD 0 decay, can lead to large interference effects and hence provide particular sensitivity to \u03b3.

The differences in the effective branching fraction for K \u2212 \u03c0 + decay opposite CP -even and -odd eigenstates, semileptonic decays, and K + \u03c0 \u2212 are sensitive to both \u03b4 K\u03c0 D and to D 0 mixing parameters.

The result is an effective average phase and a \"coherence factor\" which reflects the dilution of total interference relative to the expectation for a simple two-body decay.

In Equation 2, q 2 is the invariant mass squared of the \u03bd system, |V | is the relevant CKM matrix element for the weak transition, and f X\u2192X + is a form factor which represents the hadronic physics interactions. As in the leptonic decay case, input for either |V | or f + allows determination of the other. We analyze D \u2192 (K, \u03c0)e + \u03bd decays [19] in order to determine the form factors in bins of q 2 . Reasonable agreement on the form factor shape and normalization is found with a lattice QCD prediction from the FNAL, MILC, and HPQCD collaborations [20]. A comparison of our results to the theory can be seen in Figure 2. Using lattice predictions for |f + (0)|, values for |V cd | and |V cs | are also obtained, which are limited by lattice uncertainties.
