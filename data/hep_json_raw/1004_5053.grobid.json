Evidence for D 0 -\" D 0 mixing has been found only recently [6][7][8][9][10][11] and CPV has not been observed. Although precise SM predictions for D 0 -\" D 0 mixing are difficult to quantify, recent calculations of the mixing parameters x and y allow for values as large as O\u00f010 \u00c02 \u00de [1]. The analyses to date that have reported evidence for mixing have not been able to provide direct measurements of x and y. A time-dependent amplitude analysis of the Dalitz plot (DP) of D 0 mesons decaying into K 0 S \u00fe \u00c0 and K 0 S K \u00fe K \u00c0 self-conjugate final states offers a unique way to access the mixing parameters x and y directly. In this Letter we study the time evolution of these three-body decays as a function of the position in the DP of squared invariant masses s \u00fe \u00bc m",

The time-dependent decay amplitude for a charm meson tagged at t \u00bc 0 as D 0 or \" D 0 can then be written as where g AE \u00f0t\u00de \u00bc 1=2\u00bde \u00c0i\u00f0m 1 \u00c0i\u00c0 1 =2\u00det AE e \u00c0i\u00f0m 2 \u00c0i\u00c0 2 =2\u00det and q=p \u00bc 1 if CP is conserved in the mixing amplitude.

The variation of the distribution of the events in the DP as a function of the proper D 0 decay time is the signature of D 0 -\" D 0 mixing. The sensitivity to x and y arises mostly from regions in the DP where Cabibbo-favored and doubly Cabibbo-suppressed amplitudes interfere and from regions populated by CP eigenstates [14]. This method was pioneered by CLEO [15] and extended to a significantly larger data sample by Belle [16].",

In order to reduce combinatorial background and to remove D 0 candidates from B-meson decays, we require the momentum of the D 0 in the e \u00fe e \u00c0 center-of-mass frame to be greater than 2:5 GeV=c.

The K 0 S candidates are selected by pairing two oppositely charged pions whose invariant mass is within 9 MeV=c 2 of the nominal K 0 S mass [17]. We require the cosine of the angle between the K 0 S flight direction (defined by the K 0 S production and decay vertices) and the K 0 S momentum to be greater than 0.99, and a decay length projected along the K 0 S momentum to be greater than 10 times its error.

The resolution function is a sum of three Gaussians with one of the means allowed to differ from zero (the offset, t 0 ), and two of the widths proportional to t .

Hence, the observed distributions of t in a number of DP regions are included in the signal PDF. We apply corrections for efficiency variations and neglect the invariant mass resolution across the DP. The time-dependent PDF for the small random s background component is described by an equal combination of D 0 and \" D 0 signal events assuming no mixing, since the slow pion is positive or negative with approximately equal probability, and carries little weight in the vertex fit. The PDFs for misreconstructed D 0 events and combinatorial background are determined from m D 0 sideband samples. A nonparametric approach is used to construct the DP distributions, while the proper-time distributions are described by a sum of two Gaussian functions, one of which has a power-law tail to account for a small long-lived component. The background components containing real and misreconstructed D 0 decays have different t distributions, which are determined from the signal and m D 0 sideband regions.",

These include replacing the GS by BW line shapes, removing the mass dependence in the P vector [22], changes in form factors such as variations in the Blatt-Weisskopf radius and the effect of evaluating the momentum of the spectator particle in the D 0 meson frame rather than in the resonance rest frame, and adopting a helicity formalism [19] to describe the angular dependence. Other models are built by removing or adding resonances with small or negligible fractions.
