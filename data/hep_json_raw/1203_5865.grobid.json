            "text": "We present measurements of the differential cross section d\u03c3/dp \u03b3 T for the inclusive production of a photon in association with a b-quark jet for photons with rapidities |y \u03b3 | < 1.0 and 30 < p \u03b3 T < 300 GeV, as well as for photons with 1.5 < |y \u03b3 | < 2.5 and 30 < p \u03b3 T < 200 GeV, where p \u03b3 T is the photon transverse momentum. The b-quark jets are required to have pT > 15 GeV and rapidity |y jet | < 1.5. The results are based on data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 8.7 fb \u22121 , recorded with the D0 detector at the Fermilab Tevatron pp Collider at \u221a s =1.96 TeV. The measured cross sections are compared with next-to-leading order perturbative QCD calculations using different sets of parton distribution functions as well as to predictions based on the kT-factorization QCD approach, and those from the sherpa and pythia Monte Carlo event generators. In hadron-hadron collisions, high-energy photons (\u03b3) emerge unaltered from the hard scattering process of two partons and therefore provide a clean probe of the parton level dynamics. Study of such photons (called prompt or direct) produced in association with a b-quark also provides information about the b-quark and gluon (g) parton distribution functions (PDFs) of the incoming hadrons. Such events are produced in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) primarily through the Compton-like scattering process gb \u2192 \u03b3b, which dominates up to photon transverse momenta (p \u03b3 T ) of \u2248 70 GeV, and through quarkantiquark annihilation qq \u2192 \u03b3g \u2192 \u03b3bb, which dominates * with visitors from a Augustana College, Sioux Falls, SD, USA, b The University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK, c UPIITA-IPN, Mexico City, Mexico, d DESY, Hamburg, Germany, , e SLAC, Menlo Park, CA, USA, f University College London, London, UK, g Centro de Investigacion en Computacion -IPN, Mexico City, Mexico, h ECFM, Universidad Autonoma de Sinaloa, Culiac\u00e1n, Mexico and i Universidade Estadual Paulista, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. \u2021 Deceased.",

            "text": "T [1]. The inclusive \u03b3 + b production may also originate from partonic processes like gg \u2192 bb or bg \u2192 bg, where the final state b-quark or gluon fragments into a photon [1]. However, photon isolation requirements substantially reduce the contributions from this process. The measurements of the differential cross section as a function of p \u03b3 T and the photon (and/or b-jet) rapidity can be used to test the \u03b3 + b production mechanism and the underlying dynamics of QCD hard-scattering subprocesses with different momentum transfer scales Q and parton momentum fraction x. Measurements involving \u03b3/Z-boson and b-quark final states have previously been performed by the D0 and CDF collaborations [2][3][4][5][6]. In comparison to the previous \u03b3 + b measurement [6], we now consider not only the leading (in p T ) b-jet, but all b-jets in the event. To increase statistics in p \u03b3 T bins, we have also extended the |y jet | region which results in a larger contribution from the annihilation process. The large integrated luminosity recorded with the D0 detector in pp collisions at \u221a s = 1.96 TeV at the Fermilab Tevatron Collider and more advanced photon and b-jet identification tools [7][8][9] enable us to perform more precise measurements and to extend them in kinematic regions previously unexplored.",

This allows us to probe the dynamics of the production process in a wide kinematic range, not studied before in other measurements of a vector boson + b-jet final state. The measurement covers parton momentum fractions in the range 0.007 x 0.4. Figure  1 shows the fractional contributions of the gb \u2192 \u03b3b subprocesses to the total cross section of \u03b3 + b production with photons in the central and forward photon rapidity regions as a function of p \u03b3 T . The curves are obtained using signal processes gb \u2192 \u03b3b and qq \u2192 \u03b3bb simulated with the pythia event generator [10].

            "text": "The D0 detector is a general purpose detector discussed in detail elsewhere [12]. The subdetectors most relevant to this analysis are the central tracking system, composed of a silicon microstrip tracker (SMT) and a central fiber tracker (CFT) embedded in a 1.9 T solenoidal magnetic field, the central preshower detector (CPS), and the calorimeter. The CPS is located immediately before the inner layer of the central calorimeter and is formed of approximately one radiation length of lead absorber followed by three layers of scintillating strips. The calorimeter consists of a central section with coverage in pseudorapidity of |\u03b7 det | < 1.1 [13], and two end calorimeters covering up to |\u03b7 det | \u2248 4.2. The electromagnetic (EM) section of the calorimeter is segmented longitudinally into four layers (EMi, i = 1 \u2212 4), with transverse segmentation into cells of size \u2206\u03b7 det \u00d7\u2206\u03c6 det = 0.1 \u00d7 0.1 [13], except EM3 (near the EM shower maximum), where it is 0.05 \u00d7 0.05. The calorimeter allows for a precise measurement of the energy and direction of electrons and photons, providing an energy resolution of approximately 4% (3%) at an energy of 30 (100) GeV, and an angular resolution of 0.01 radians. The energy response of the calorimeter to photons is calibrated using electrons from Z boson decays. Since electrons and photons shower differently in matter, additional energy corrections as a function of y \u03b3 are derived using a detailed geant-based [14] simulation of the D0 detector response. These corrections are largest, \u2248 2%, at photon energies of about 30 GeV. The data used in this analysis satisfy D0 data quality requirements and are collected using a combination of triggers requiring a cluster of energy in the electromagnetic (EM) calorimeter with loose shower shape requirements, and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 8.7 \u00b1 0.5 fb \u22121 [15]. The trigger efficiency is \u2248 96% for photon candidates with p \u03b3 T \u223c30 GeV and \u2248 100% for p \u03b3 T > 40 GeV. Offline event selection requires a reconstructed pp interaction vertex [16] within 60 cm of the center of the detector along the beam axis. The efficiency of the vertex requirement is \u2248 (96 \u2212 98)%, depending on p \u03b3 T . The missing transverse momentum in the event is required to be less than 0.7p \u03b3 T to suppress background from W \u2192 e\u03bd decays. Such a requirement is highly efficient for signal events, with an efficiency \u2265 98% even for events with semi-leptonic heavy-flavor quark decays.",

Here, the particle level includes all stable particles as defined in Ref. [19]. Signal events are generated using the sherpa [20] and pythia event generators, processed through a geant-based [14] simulation and events reconstruction as described above. The acceptance is driven by the selection requirements in \u03b7 det (applied to avoid edge effects in the calorimeter regions used for the measurement) and \u03c6 det in the central rapidity region (to avoid periodic calorimeter module boundaries [12] that bias the EM cluster energy and position measurements), photon rapidity y \u03b3 and energy, and bin-tobin migration effects due to the finite energy and angular resolution of the EM calorimeter. The acceptance varies within (82 \u2212 90)% with a relative systematic uncertainty of (2 \u2212 5)%. The EM clusters reconstructed in the acceptance region are required to pass the photon identification criteria listed in the previous paragraph. Average correction factors to account for differences between data and simulations are obtained with the sherpa events, while the difference from the corrections obtained with pythia is used as systematic uncertainty. Small differences between data and MC in the photon selection efficiencies are corrected for with suitable scale factors derived using control samples of electrons from Z boson decays, as well as photons from the radiative Z boson decays [18]. The total efficiency of the above photon selection criteria is (68 \u2212 85)%, depending on the p \u03b3 T and rapidity region. The systematic uncertainties on these values are 3% for |y \u03b3 | < 1.0 and 7.3% for 1.5 < |y \u03b3 | < 2.5 and are mainly due to uncertainties caused by the track-match veto, isolation, and the \u03b3-NN requirements. The contamination from Z(\u2192 e + e \u2212 )+jet and W (\u2192 e\u03bd)+jet events is estimated from the simulation and is found to be negligible ( 1%) for both photon rapidity regions.",

Jets are reconstructed using the D0 Run II algorithm [21] with a cone radius of R = 0.5. The jet acceptance with respect to the p jet T and |y jet | kinematic cuts varies between 88% and 100% in different photon p T bins. The uncertainties on the acceptance due to the jet energy scale, jet energy resolution, and difference in energy scale correction between light flavor and b-jets vary between 1% and 7%, increasing for smaller p \u03b3 T . The jet is required to have at least two associated tracks with p T > 0.5 GeV with at least one hit in the SMT. The track with the highest p T must have p T > 1.0 GeV. These criteria ensure that there is sufficient information to classify the jet as a heavy-flavor candidate and have a typical efficiency of about 90%. Light jets (caused by light quarks or gluons) are suppressed using a dedicated artificial neural network (b-NN) [9] that employs the longer lifetimes of heavyflavor hadrons relative to their lighter counterparts. The inputs to the b-NN combine several characteristic quantities of the jet and associated tracks to provide a continuous output value that tends towards one for b-jets and zero for the light jets. The b-NN input variables providing most of the discrimination are the number of reconstructed secondary vertices (SV) in the jet, the invariant mass of charged particle tracks associated with the SV (M SV ), the number of tracks used to reconstruct the SV, the two-dimensional decay length significance of the SV in the plane transverse to the beam, a weighted combination of the tracks' transverse impact parameter significances, and the probability that the tracks associated with the jet originate from the pp interaction vertex. The jet is required to have a b-NN output > 0.3. Depending on p \u03b3 T , this selection is (40 \u2212 52)% efficient for b-jets with systematic uncertainties of (6 \u2212 23)% for the \u03b3 + b events with |y \u03b3 | < 1.0 and of (7 \u2212 11)% for those with 1.5 < |y \u03b3 | < 2.5, both increasing as a function of p \u03b3 T .

In addition to events with light-flavor jets a second source of background is represented by multi-jet events in which one jet is misidentified as a photon. To estimate the photon purity, the \u03b3-NN distribution in data is fitted to a linear combination of templates for photons and jets obtained from simulated \u03b3 + jet and dijet samples, respectively. An independent fit is performed in each p \u03b3 T bin, yielding photon purities between 62% and 99% for the events with the central photons and between 40% and 55% for the events with the forward photons. The obtained photon fractions are shown in Fig. 2. The p \u03b3 T dependence of the purity is fitted in each region using a two-parameter function P = 1 \u2212 exp(a + bp \u03b3 T ). The systematic uncertainties on the fit are estimated using two alternative fitting functions. These photon purities differ at most by 7% when compared with those obtained for inclusive events, i.e. without the requirement of a heavyflavor jet. An additional systematic uncertainty in the photon fractions due to the fragmentation model implemented in pythia is also taken into account [22]. This uncertainty is estimated by varying the production rate of \u03c0 0 and \u03b7 mesons by \u00b150% with respect to their central values [23]. It is found to be about 6% at p \u03b3 T \u2243 30 GeV, 2% at p \u03b3 T \u2243 50 GeV, and \u2264 1% at p \u03b3 T 70 GeV. The fractions of b-jets are determined by fitting M SV templates for b, c and light jets to the data. Jets from b-quarks tend to have larger values of M SV , in contrast to light jets. For b-and c-jets, the templates are obtained from simulation, while the light jet template is derived from a data sample, enriched in light jets, referred to as negatively tagged data (NT data). The NT data comprises the jets that have negative values for some of the inputs to the b-NN algorithm (such as negative decay length and negative impact parameter significance) which are caused by detector resolution effects [9]. After correcting the NT data for the small contamination from heavy-flavor jets, we have verified that the M SV template shapes in NT data and light jets in the MC simulation agree well.",

The statistical uncertainty on the results ranges from 2% in the first p \u03b3 T bin to \u2248 11% in the last p \u03b3 T bins, while the total systematic uncertainty varies between 12% and 36%. The main source of the uncertainty at low p \u03b3 T is due to the photon purity (up to 8%), the b-jet fraction fit (6 \u2212 7%), and the luminosity (6.1%) [15]. At higher p \u03b3 T , the uncertainty is dominated by the fractions of b-jets and their selection efficiencies. Systematic uncertainties are highly bin-tobin correlated for the first three p \u03b3 T bins, while the total systematic uncertainty is nearly uncorrelated across the bins at p \u03b3 T > 70 GeV. Next-to-leading order (NLO) perturbative QCD predictions, with the renormalization scale \u00b5 R , factorization scale \u00b5 F , and fragmentation scale \u00b5 f all set to p \u03b3 T , are also given in Tables I and II. These predictions [1] are based on a phase space slicing method used to calculate the cross section analytically [25]. The uncertainty from the choice of scale is estimated through a simultaneous variation of all three scales by a factor of two, i.e. for \u00b5 R,F,f = 0.5p \u03b3 T and 2p \u03b3 T . The predictions utilize cteq6.6M PDFs [11] and are corrected for nonperturbative effects of parton-to-hadron fragmentation and multiple parton interactions. The latter are evaluated using sherpa and pythia MC samples using their default settings [10,20].

Apart from this resummation, the non-vanishing transverse momentum distribution of the colliding partons are taken into account. These effects lead to a broadening of the photon transverse momentum distribution in this approach [26]. The scale uncertainties on these predictions vary from about 31% (\u221228%) at 30 < p \u03b3 T < 40 GeV to about 5% (14%) for the central photons and 26% (\u221213%) for the forward photons in the last p \u03b3 T bin. Tables I and II also contain predictions of the pythia [10] MC event generator with the cteq6.1L PDF set. It includes only 2 \u2192 2 matrix elements (ME) with gb \u2192 \u03b3b and qq \u2192 \u03b3g scatterings (defined at LO) and, with g \u2192 bb splitting in the parton shower (PS). We also provide predictions by the sherpa MC event generator [20] with the cteq6.6M PDF set [11]. For \u03b3 + b production, sherpa includes all the MEs with one photon and up to three jets, with at least one b-jet in our kinematic region. In particular, it accounts for an additional hard jet that accompanies the photon associated with a bb pair. Compared to an NLO calculation, there is an additional benefit of imposing resummation (further emissions) through the consistent combination with the PS. Matching between the ME partons and the PS jets follows the prescription given in Ref. [29]. Systematic uncertainties are estimated by varying the ME-PS matching scale by \u00b15 GeV around the chosen central value [30]. As a result, the sherpa cross sections vary up to \u00b17% for the central photons and up to \u221225%/+17% for the forward photons, where the uncertainty is largest in the first p \u03b3 T bin. All the theoretical predictions are obtained including the isolation requirement on the photons E iso T < 2.5 GeV at the particle level. The predictions are compared to data in Fig. 5 as a function of p \u03b3 T . The ratios of data over the NLO QCD calculations and of different QCD predictions or MC simulation to the same NLO QCD calculations are shown in Fig. 6 as a function of p \u03b3 T for both central and forward photons. The ratio of NLO predictions with cteq6.6M to those with mstw2008 [31] and abkm09nlo [32] are also shown on the plots.",

The cross sec-tion slopes in data significantly differ from the predicted ones in both photon rapidity regions. The results indicate a need for higher order perturbative QCD corrections in the large p \u03b3 T region, that is dominated by the annihilation process qq \u2192 \u03b3g (g \u2192 bb), and resummation of diagrams with additional gluon radiation. The QCD predictions from the k T -factorization approach is in better agreement with data. The best agreement is obtained with the sherpa MC that allows up to two extra hard partons (jets) in ME in addition to the b-quark (jet) and includes the consistent treatment of the possible contributions from the parton shower. However, correcting the sherpa predictions by including additional higher order contributions, as is done, for instance, for W +jets events, would be desirable [33].",

A good description of the data can only be achieved by including higher order corrections into the NLO QCD predictions, which are currently present as additional real emissions in the sherpa MC generator.
