            "text": "Resonance states of axion-like particles were searched for via four-wave mixing by focusing twocolor pulsed lasers into a quasi-vacuum. A quasi-parallel collision system that allows probing of the sub-eV mass range was realized by focusing the combined laser fields with an off-axis parabolic mirror. A 0.10 mJ/34 fs Ti:sapphire laser pulse and a 0.14 mJ/9 ns Nd:YAG laser pulse were spatiotemporally synchronized by sharing a common optical axis and focused into the vacuum system. No significant four-wave mixing signal was observed at the vacuum pressure of 3.7 \u00d7 10 \u22125 Pa, thereby providing upper bounds on the coupling-mass relation by assuming exchanges of scalar and pseudoscalar fields at a 95% confidence level in the mass range below 0.21 eV. For this search, the experimental setup was substantially upgraded so that the optical components were compatible with the requirements of the high-quality vacuum system, hence enabling the pulse power to be increased. With the increased pulse power, a new kind of pressuredependent background photon emerged in addition to the known atomic four-wave mixing process. This paper shows the pressure dependence of these background photons and how to handle them in the search.",

            "text": "The spontaneous breaking of a global symmetry accompanies a massless Nambu-Goldstone boson (NGB) [1,2]. In nature, however, such an NGB possesses a finite mass due to complicated quantum corrections. The neutral pion is such a pseudo-NGB (pNGB) state, gaining mass because of chiral symmetry breaking in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). The concept of spontaneous symmetry breaking can be a robust guiding principle to understand dark matter and dark energy in the context of particle physics. Indeed, several theoretical models predict low-mass pNGBs such as the QCD axion [3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10] for solving the strong CP problem, and pNGBs in the contexts of string theory [11][12][13] and unified inflation and dark matter [14], which are commonly pseudoscalar fields. As a scalar-field example, the dilaton is predicted as a source of dark energy [15]. These weakly coupling pNGBs are known generically as axion-like particles (ALPs). Because it is difficult to evaluate the physical masses of pNGBs theoretically, model-independent laboratory experiments are indispensable for PTEP 2020, 073C01",

By adjusting the beam diameter d and focal length f , we can control the range of possible incident angles within \u03b8, that is, the accessible range of E CMS in a single focusing geometry. Because \u03d1 can be close to zero, the QPS is in principle sensitive to pNGBs with almost zero mass. Consequently, the photon-photon scattering in the QPS is accessible to the mass range 0 < m < 2\u03c9 \u03b8, although the sensitivity to a lower mass range is steeply suppressed. Capturing a resonant pNGB within an E CMS uncertainty via an schannel exchange is the first key element of this method to increase the interaction rate. The second key element is in stimulation to guide the scattering to a fixed final state. The dashed (magenta) laser beam with photon energy u\u03c9 (0 < u < 1) indicates the inducing laser field to stimulate the interaction, where the probability of generating a signal photon with energy (2 \u2212 u)\u03c9 is enhanced via energy-momentum conservation in \u03c9 + \u03c9 \u2192 pNGB \u2192 u\u03c9 + (2 \u2212 u)\u03c9 by the coherent nature of the co-propagating inducing laser. The scattering probability increases in proportion to (i) the number of photons in the inducing laser and (ii) the square of the number of photons in the creation laser [18][19][20][21]. This process is kinematically similar to four-wave mixing in the context of atomic physics [22].",

For this upgrade the main optical components were installed in the vacuum system, which consists of transport chambers and an interaction chamber separately. We mostly respected the construction of the high-quality vacuum system, especially for the interaction part, which required downsizing of the optical paths and also the capability to manipulate the optical components from outside the chambers. The main purpose of the present search is therefore to show the extensibility of this searching method in such a high-quality vacuum system, even if new types of background sources emerge as a result of increased laser intensities.",

The linear polarization state of the creation laser was produced at P1 before the pulse compression. P1 consisted of 30 synthetic quartz plates tilted at Brewster's angle to transmit only p-polarized waves. The measured extinction ratio with the full energy shots was approximately 1000 (p-pol.) : 1 (s-pol.). The linear polarization state of the inducing laser was produced at P2 with a commercial polarization beam splitter with an extinction ratio 200 (p-pol) : 1 (s-pol.), and then the p-polarized waves were converted into s-polarized waves by a periscope. The s-polarized waves can be further rotated by a half-wave plate for the systematic studies. The creation and inducing lasers, with beam diameters of 38 mm and 16 mm, respectively, were combined by a dichroic mirror (DM2). A 6 mm-thick window (W2) separated the vacuum systems between the interaction point (IP) and the upstream transport parts. The combined beam was thus focused into the higher-quality vacuum part inside the interaction chamber after penetrating W2. An off-axial parabolic mirror (OAP1) with a focal length of 279.1 mm was used for the focusing. Signal photons appeared only when spatiotemporal synchronization was achieved between the two pulsed beams at the IP. Background photons with the same wavelength as the signal ones generated along the optical path before OAP1 were removed by five long-pass filters (LPFs) that cut the signal wavelengths but transmitted the creation and inducing wavelengths in advance of OAP1.",

Figure 9 shows the number of photons, n C \u2212n P , in trigger pattern C within the signal timing window after subtracting the side-band background photons from the peak part as a function of pressure. This indicates that n C \u2212 n P scales with P 2.2 and reaches zero within the statistical uncertainty below 1 Pa. Because n C \u2212 n P is strongly pressure dependent, we conclude that this background source is generated from the IP but is different from the conventional four-wave mixing process because it does not require the inducing laser to produce the same frequency as that of four-wave mixing. Creation of a plasma state at the IP by the higher-power creation laser might explain the broad-band emissions, though this is not directly relevant to the present search because we can subtract trigger pattern C from pattern S.",

However, we know that the parallel case dominates the orthogonal case at a higher pressure range above 10 2 Pa [17]. Thus, the pressure dependence in Fig. 8 can give an upper limit on the number of photons from the atomic four-wave mixing process even without the measured pressure dependence for the orthogonal case, which is the actual searching configuration as discussed in Sect. 2. Figure 10 shows the independence of the number of photons with respect to pressure values in the case of the orthogonal polarization combination at a much lower pressure range compared to Fig. 8.

We emphasize that Eq. 11   and inducing lasers were 101 \u00b1 4 \u03bcJ and 300 \u00b1 5 \u03bcJ, respectively, at the beginning of the first run, while they were 98 \u00b1 4 \u03bcJ and 303 \u00b1 5 \u03bcJ, respectively, at the end of the final run. So the absolute pulse energies of the two lasers were quite stable over the entire data-taking period for 40 hours. This overlap factor reflects the nature of four-wave mixing on the cubic intensity dependence. Systematic error III is an error caused by the threshold value used for the peak finding.

The energy ratio was measured based on the intensity distributions at the common camera. In advance of the search, D was measured with 532 nm laser pulses. We corrected the difference of the quantum efficiencies between 532 nm and 651 nm based on the relative quantum efficiencies provided by the HAMAMATSU specification sheet. The upper limits on the coupling-mass relation at a 95% confidence level were obtained based on the null hypothesis that the fluctuations of the number of signal photons follow Gaussian distributions whose expectation value, \u03bc, is zero for the given total number of shots, W S = 4.2 \u00d7 10 4 . This null hypothesis is justified. First, the expectation value based on the unique standard model process, that is, the quantum electrodynamic photon-photon scattering process is negligibly small at E CMS < 1 eV [16] even if we add the stimulation effect [24] for the given shot statistics. Second, as discussed with the inequality in Eq. 13, the expectation value due to atomic processes in the residual gas is well below unity. Therefore, the background source is limited to only noise in the experimental environment. Systematic error I is the dominant component of the systematic errors. This was estimated by measuring the root-mean-square of the number of photon-like signals excluding the signal window. In fact, the measured N s distribution excluding the signal time window follows almost a perfect Gaussian distribution around its central value, though the central value itself has no specific meaning with respect to the signal timing window. Since the distribution is symmetric around the central value, a Gaussian distribution can be supported from the measurement whatever the physics behind it is. The Gaussian distribution is also deduced from the principle point of view. What we measure is accidentally incident photon-like waveforms in an arbitrary time window (e.g. thermal noise, ambient photons from lasers and not from lasers, electric noise, and so forth) which should follow binomial distributions if the incident probabilities are individually constant over the measuring time. Although the incident probabilities are quite low, the expectation values of background photon-like signals per time bin over the data acquisition time are around 100, as seen in trigger patterns S and C in Fig. 11. Therefore, we may expect that the numbers of background photons per time bin can be approximated as Gaussian distributions because the expectation value is large enough. N s then eventually corresponds to subtractions between these Gaussian distributions. We thus assume that the Gaussian distribution is the most natural null hypothesis in our search. In order to set a confidence level 1 \u2212 \u03b1 to exclude the null hypothesis, we assign the acceptance-uncorrected uncertainty \u03b4N S which was evaluated as the quadratic sum of statistical and systematic errors in Eq. 14as the one standard deviation \u03c3 to the following Gaussian kernel:",

The observed number of four-wave mixing photons in the quasi-vacuum state at 3.7 \u00d7 10 \u22125 Pa was 5.4 \u00b1 30.7(stat.) \u00b1 25.1(syst.I) \u00b1 10.1(syst.II) \u00b1 0.9(syst.III). We thus conclude that no significant four-wave mixing signal was observed in this search. The expected number of four-wave mixing photons from the residual gas is sufficiently small based on the upper limit from the measurement of the pressure dependence. With respect to an assumption that uncertainties are dominated by systematic fluctuations around the zero expectation value following a Gaussian distribution, we provided the upper limits on the coupling-mass relations for scalar and pseudoscalar fields at a 95% confidence level in the mass range below 0.21 eV. The upper limits on the coupling at m = 0.21 eV were obtained as 4.6 \u00d7 10 \u22126 GeV \u22121 and 5.1 \u00d7 10 \u22126 GeV \u22121 for scalar and pseudoscalar fields, respectively.",

We prioritized construction of the high-quality vacuum system over a rapid increase of the creation laser intensity, which is designed to achieve 10 \u22128 Pa if a metal shield is installed for the lid contact, by introducing the entrance window (W2 in Fig. 3) in the interaction chamber to completely decouple the upstream transport vacuum system where the pressure is much higher. However, this window material indeed became an obstacle against drastically increasing the laser intensity, because high-intensity laser fields must penetrate the window through which a new background source was created in addition to the residual atoms around the IP. Therefore, the intensity improvement for the creation laser from the previously published search [17] was rather moderate in the present search. In this search, however, we have shown clearly that the null result can be obtained with the current searching method, and we succeeded in measuring the pressure scaling of the atomic four-wave mixing process and also another plasma-like phenomenon down to \u223c1 Pa. For the next upgraded search, we thus plan to eliminate this window. Instead, a differential pumping system will be inserted between the transport vacuum system and the interaction chamber. Therefore, we may expect that we can drastically improve the sensitivity with \u223c10 3 times higher creation laser intensity available at the T 6 -laser system in the upgraded system.",
