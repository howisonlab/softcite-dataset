To date, no charged LFV decays such as \u03bc \u2212 \u2192 e \u2212 \u03b3 , \u03bc \u2212 \u2192 e \u2212 e + e \u2212 , \u03c4 \u2212 \u2192 \u2212 \u03b3 and \u03c4 \u2212 \u2192 \u2212 + \u2212 (with \u2212 = e \u2212 , \u03bc \u2212 ) have been observed [4]. Baryon number violation (BNV) is believed to have occurred in the early universe, although the mechanism is unknown. BNV in charged lepton decays automatically implies lepton number and lepton flavour violation, with angular momentum conservation requiring the change | (B \u2212 L)| = 0 or 2, where B and L are the net baryon and lepton numbers. The SM and most of its extensions [1] require | (B \u2212 L)| = 0. Any observation of BNV or charged LFV would be a clear sign for BSM physics, while a lowering of the experimental upper limits on branching fractions would further constrain the parameter spaces of BSM models.",

The detector includes a high precision tracking system consisting of a silicon-strip vertex detector surrounding the pp interaction region, a large-area silicon-strip detector located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4 Tm, and three stations of silicon-strip detectors and straw drift tubes placed downstream. The combined tracking system has momentum resolution p/p that varies from 0.4% at 5 GeV/c to 0.6% at 100 GeV/c, and impact parameter resolution of 20 \u03bcm for tracks with high transverse momentum (p T ). Charged hadrons are identified using two RICH detectors. Photon, electron and hadron candidates are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter and a hadronic calorimeter. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers. The trigger [13] consists of a hardware stage, based on information from the calorimeter and muon systems, followed by a software stage that applies a full event reconstruction. The hardware trigger selects muons with p T > 1.48 GeV/c. The software trigger requires a two-, three-or four-track secondary vertex with a high sum of the p T of the tracks and a significant displacement from the primary pp interaction vertices (PVs). At least one track should have p T > 1.7 GeV/c and impact parameter chi-squared (IP \u03c7 2 ), with respect to the pp collision vertex, greater than 16. The IP \u03c7 2 is defined as the difference between the \u03c7 2 of the PV reconstructed with and without the track under consideration.

The likelihood M 3body uses the properties of the reconstructed \u03c4 decay to distinguish displaced three-body decays from N-body decays (with N > 3) and combinations of tracks from different vertices. Variables used include the vertex quality and its displacement from the PV, and the IP and fit \u03c7 2 values of the tracks. The likelihood M PID quantifies the compatibility of each of the three particles with the muon hypothesis using information from the RICH detectors, the calorimeters and the muon stations; the value of M PID is taken as the smallest one of the three muon candidates. For \u03c4 \u2192 p\u03bc\u03bc, the use of M PID is replaced by cuts on PID quantities. The invariant mass likelihood uses the reconstructed mass of the \u03c4 candidate to help discriminate between signal and background.",

The signal distributions are modelled with the sum of two Gaussian functions with a common mean, where the narrower Gaussian contributes 70% of the total signal yield, while the combinatorial backgrounds are modelled with linear functions. The expected widths of the \u03c4 signals in data are taken from simulation, scaled by the ratio of the widths of the D \u2212 s peaks in data and simulation.
