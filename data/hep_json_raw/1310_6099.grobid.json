However, the experimental observations of the decays \u03b7 c /\u03c7 c0 \u2192 pp [3], as well as h c formed in the pp annihilation [4], indicate substantial contributions due to finite masses. These observations have stimulated many theoretical efforts [5][6][7]. In Ref. [8], it is pointed out that the branching fraction of \u03b7 c (2S) \u2192 pp with respect to that of \u03b7 c \u2192 pp may serve as a criterion to validate the helicity conservation theorem, and an anomalous decay in \u03b7 c (2S) might imply the existence of a glueball. For the decay h c \u2192 pp, possible large branching fractions are suggested. Authors of Ref. [5] investigate the long distance contribution via charmed hadron loops and predict B(h c \u2192 pp) = (1.52 \u2212 1.93) \u00d7 10 \u22123 . In Ref. [6], a branching fraction of B(h c \u2192 pp) = (3.2 \u00b10.5) \u00d710 \u22123 is predicted by \"factorizing\" the initial and the final states.",

In the \u03c7 cJ signal region (3.3 GeV/c 2 \u2264 M(pp) \u2264 3.6 GeV/c 2 ), the main backgrounds come from the decays \u03c8(3686) \u2192 \u03c0 0 pp or the nonresonant process \u03c8(3686) \u2192 \u03b3pp. Since the energy of the transition photon from \u03c8(3686) \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7 c (2S) is only 50 MeV, \u03c8(3686) \u2192 pp events can easily fake signal events by combining with a fake photon. With a 4C kinematic fit, those events will produce a peak in the pp mass spectrum close to the expected \u03b7 c (2S) mass. Therefore, a three-constraint (3C) kinematic fit, where the magnitude of the photon momentum is allowed to float, is used to determine signal yields. The 3C fit keeps the \u03c8(3686) \u2192 pp peak at the correct position as the photon momentum tends to zero, and it can separate this background from the \u03b7 c (2S) signal efficiently as shown in Fig. 1  [15].

The \u03c0 0 pp selection is the same as that for \u03c8(3686) \u2192 \u03c0 0 h c , h c \u2192 pp. A MC sample of \u03c8(3686) \u2192 \u03c0 0 pp is generated to determine the efficiencies of the \u03b3pp selection (\u03b5 \u03b3pp ) and the \u03c0 0 pp selection (\u03b5 \u03c0 0 pp ). The selected \u03c0 0 pp events corrected by the efficiencies (\u03b5 \u03b3pp /\u03b5 \u03c0 0 pp ) are taken as the \u03c0 0 pp background in \u03c8(3686) \u2192 \u03b3pp. The shape of this background can be described with a Novosibirsk function [16] as shown in Fig. 2. For \u03c8(3686) \u2192 \u03c0 0 h c \u2192 \u03c0 0 pp, the main background sources are the decays \u03c8(3686) \u2192 \u03b3\u03c7 cJ , \u03c7 cJ \u2192 pp (where J = 1, 2) combined with a fake photon and the \u03c0 0 pp decay from \u03c8(3686) or continuum process. The \u03c7 cJ backgrounds are strongly suppressed by using the 3C kinematic fit, where the momentum of the photon with lower energy is allowed to float. For the \u03c7 cJ backgrounds, the M(pp\u03b3 high ) (where \u03b3 high is the photon with higher energy) with 3C peaks at 3.686 GeV/c 2 , while for the h c signal, it is below 3.66 GeV/c 2 as shown in Fig. 3  [15]. A requirement M(pp\u03b3 high ) < 3.66 GeV/c 2 is used to remove this background effectively. The \u03c0 0 pp background from the continuum process is studied with the data sample taken at \u221a s = 3.65 GeV and is found not peaking in the signal region.  ",

E \u03b3 which equals to (m 2 \u03c8(3686) \u2212 m 2 )/2m \u03c8(3686) is the energy of the transition photon in the rest frame of \u03c8(3686), and f damp (E \u03b3 ) is a function that damps the diverging tail originating from the E 3 \u03b3 dependence at the low mass side (corresponding to high energy of the radiative photon). The form of the damping factor was introduced by the KEDR collaboration and is f damp (E \u03b3 ) = [18], where E 0 is the peak energy of the transition photon. The \u03c0 0 pp background is described with a Novosibirsk function with the fixed shape and amplitude as described earlier. The backgrounds from \u03c8(3686) \u2192 pp and \u03c8(3686) \u2192 pp\u03b3 FSR are described with a shape based on a MC simulation, where the FSR photon is simulated with PHOTOS [19], and their magnitudes are allowed to float. The shape of the nonresonant background is determined from a MC simulation while its magnitude is allowed to float. To account for a possible difference in the mass resolution between data and MC simulation, a smearing Gaussian function G(\u00b5, \u03c3) is convolved with the line shape of \u03c7 cJ , and the parameters of this function are free in the fit. Since we find that the discrepancy in the mass resolution decreases with increasing M(pp) and is close to zero in the \u03b7 c (2S) region, a MC-determined line shape is directly used for the \u03b7 c (2S) in the fit to data. The fitting results are shown in Fig. 4. The signal yields of \u03c7 c0 , \u03c7 c1 , \u03c7 c2 , and \u03b7 c (2S) are 1222 \u00b1 39, 453 \u00b1 23, 405 \u00b1 21 and 34 \u00b1 17, respectively. The statistical significance of the \u03b7 c (2S) signal is 1.7\u03c3. The goodness of fit is \u03c7 2 /ndf = 50.8/65, which indicates a reasonable fit.",

The uncertainty in the kinematic fit comes from the inconsistency between the data and MC simulation of the track-helix parameters. We make corrections to the helix parameters according to the procedure described in Ref.

The helicity angular distribution of protons from \u03c7 cJ is taken from measured data and fitted by the formula 1 + \u03b1 cos 2 \u03b8.

This allows some systematic errors, such as errors in the tracking efficiency and the damping factor, to cancel out. The result is inflated by a factor 1/(1 \u2212 \u03c3), where the fractional systematic error \u03c3 is dominated by the B(\u03b7 c (2S) \u2192 KK\u03c0) measurement. The 90% C.L. upper limit is determined to be B(\u03b7 c (2S) \u2192 pp) < 4.8 \u00d7 10 \u22123 .

The 90% C.L. upper limits of the branching fractions for \u03b7 c (2S) \u2192 pp and h c \u2192 pp are determined. The current upper limit of B(\u03b7 c (2S) \u2192 pp), which is larger than the measurement of B(\u03b7 c \u2192 pp) [26], cannot directly test the conjecture of Ref. [8] to validate the helicity theorem. The upper limit on B(h c \u2192 pp) obtained from this work is consistent with the earlier experimental results [4] and is lower than the predictions [5,6], where model parameters may need to be tuned. The branching fractions of \u03c7 cJ \u2192 pp are measured with improved precision, consistent with the most recent measurement by CLEO-c [28], and the results are also compatible with theoretical calculation of B(\u03c7 cJ \u2192 pp) (J = 0, 1, 2) by including the color octet contribution [29]. The results presented in this paper will be of interest for future experiments like PANDA in their search for hadronic resonances [30].",
