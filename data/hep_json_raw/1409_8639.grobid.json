With an integrated luminosity of 4.6 fb \u22121 , this data set allows for an exploration of a large kinematic range, including jet production up to a transverse momentum of 1 TeV and multiplicities up to seven associated jets. The production cross sections for W bosons are measured in both the electron and muon decay channels. Differential cross sections for many observables are also presented including measurements of the jet observables such as the rapidities and the transverse momenta as well as measurements of event observables such as the scalar sums of the transverse momenta of the jets. The measurements are compared to numerous QCD predictions including next-toleading-order perturbative calculations, resummation calculations and Monte Carlo generators.",

            "text": "With the large data sample accumulated in 2011 at the large hadron collider (LHC), detailed investigations of perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD) and electroweak (EWK) effects are now possible over five orders of magnitude in the W + jets production cross section as a function of jet multiplicity and six orders of magnitude as a function of the jet transverse momenta. For the production of a massive gauge boson accompanied by jets, jet transverse momenta up to 1 TeV are now, for the first time, accessible; this is a kinematic region where higher-order EWK effects can become as important as those from higher-order pQCD corrections. During the last few years, advances in the theoretical frameworks for the calculation of final states containing a vector boson and jets allow cross sections to be determined at nextto-leading order (NLO) in pQCD for vector bosons with up to five jets in the final state [1]. However, although calculations of EWK effects exist [2], they are not yet incorporated into the theoretical predictions of W + jets production. e-mail: atlas.publications@cern.ch Measurements of W + jets production in proton-antiproton collisions with a centre-of-mass energy of \u221a s = 1.96 TeV have been reported by the CDF and D0 collaborations [3,4] and for \u221a s = 7 TeV proton-proton collisions using an integrated luminosity of 35 pb \u22121 by the ATLAS collaboration [5] and 5.0 fb \u22121 by the CMS collaboration [6]. This paper presents updated and extended measurements of W + jets production in proton-proton collisions at \u221a s = 7 TeV by the ATLAS collaboration using an integrated luminosity of 4.6 fb \u22121 collected in 2011 and includes detailed comparisons to a number of new theoretical predictions. The results in this paper are based on both the W \u2192 e\u03bd and W \u2192 \u03bc\u03bd decay channels.",

In order of increasing radii, the inner tracker consists of silicon pixel and microstrip detectors and a transition radiation tracker, and provides precision tracking for charged particles in the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 2.5. The calorimeter system has liquid argon (LAr) or scintillator tiles as the active media. In the pseudorapidity region |\u03b7| < 3.2, high-granularity LAr electromagnetic (EM) sampling calorimeters are used. A scintillator tile calorimeter provides hadronic coverage for |\u03b7| < 1.7. The endcap and forward regions, spanning 1.5 < |\u03b7| < 4.9, are instrumented with LAr calorimeters for both the EM and hadronic measurements. The muon spectrometer consists of three large superconducting toroids each consisting of eight coils and a system of trigger chambers and precision tracking chambers which provide triggering and tracking capabilities in the ranges |\u03b7| < 2.4 and |\u03b7| < 2.7, respectively. A three-level trigger system is used to select interesting events [8]. The Level-1 trigger reduces the event rate to less than 75 kHz using hardwarebased trigger algorithms acting on a subset of detector information. Two software-based trigger levels further reduce the event rate to about 400 Hz using the complete detector information.",

For the ALPGEN samples, the matrix element implemented in this generator produces events with up to five additional partons in the final state and is interfaced to HERWIG v6.520 [12,13] for parton showering and fragmentation, with JIMMY v4.31 [14] for underlying event contributions and with PHOTOS [15] to calculate final-state radiation from quantum electrodynamics (QED). ALPGEN uses the MLM matching scheme [9] to remove any double counting between the matrix element and parton shower calculations. The CTEQ6L1 [16] parton distribution functions (PDFs) are used with the AUET2-CTEQ6L1 set of generator parameters (tune) [17]. ALPGEN samples including heavy-flavour production, such as W + bb, W + cc and W + c production, are used in the estimate of the tt background. Samples of W \u2192 \u03bd are also produced with ALPGEN v2.14 interfaced to PYTHIA v6.425 [18] using the PERUGIA2011C [19] tune and are used to estimate the uncertainties due to non-perturbative effects, as described in Sect. 7.1. Samples of W \u2192 \u03bd are also produced using SHERPA, which uses the CKKW [20] matching scheme, CT10 PDFs [21] and an internal model for QED radiation based on the YFS method [22].

The electron must have p T > 25 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.47 and electrons in the transition region between the barrel and endcap calorimeter (1.37 < |\u03b7| < 1.52) are rejected.

In both the muon and electron channels, the shape for the first template is obtained from data while the second template is from simulation. To select a data sample enriched in multijet events in the electron channel, dedicated electron triggers with loose identification criteria and additional triggers requiring electrons as well as jets are used. The multijet template is built from events which fail the \"tight\" requirements of the nominal electron selection in order to suppress signal contamination. Electrons are also required to be non-isolated in the calorimeter, i.e. they are required to have an energy deposition in the calorimeter in a cone of R = 0.3 centred on the electron direction larger than 20 % of the total transverse energy of the electron. In the muon channel, the multijet template is also obtained from data, by selecting events where the scalar sum p T of all tracks within a cone of size R = 0.2 around the muon is between 10 % and 50 % of the muon p T .",

Although tt simulations can be used to estimate this background, a data-driven approach is used in order to reduce the systematic uncertainties. Using a similar method to that used for the multijet background determination, the number of tt events is estimated by fitting a discriminant distribution in the data to the sum of three templates: the tt template, the multijet template and one which includes the signal and remaining background contributions. The discriminant variable chosen is the transformed aplanarity, defined as e (\u22128 A) , where A, the aplanarity, is 1.5 times the smallest eigenvalue of the normalised momentum tensor as defined in Ref. [46]. By definition, an isotropic event has an aplanarity of one half, whereas a planar event has a value of zero. Since tt events are more isotropic than the W + jets signal, the transformed aplanarity was found to yield good separation between the signal and background with small systematic uncertainties on the background estimate. For the aplanarity calculation, the lepton and all jets passing the selection are used in the momentum tensor. The multijet template is as described above and the W signal template is taken from simulations. The tt template is derived from a control region in data by requiring at least one b-tagged jet in the event. A multivariate b-tagging algorithm was used at a working point with a 70 % b-tagging efficiency [47]. With this selection, the tt control region has a purity of 60 % in events with three jets and 97 % in events with six jets. Non-tt events passing the selection, such as W + light-jets, W + b, W + c and b-tagged multijet events are subtracted from the tt control region using simulations or in the case of the multijet events using the fit to E miss T as described above but with an event sample where the b-tagging requirement has been applied. Since b-tagging is only available for jets within |y| < 2.4 where information from the tracking detectors exists, the b-tagging selection biases some of the kinematic distributions, most notably the jet rapidity distribution. To account for this, tt simulations are used to correct for any residual bias. The corrections are a few percent in most regions but up to 30 % at very high jet rapidities. The fits to the transformed aplanarity distribution are performed for each exclusive jet multiplicity from three to six jets. In the fit, the normalisation of the multijet background is obtained from the E miss T fit above. The estimated number of tt events is consistent with the predictions from tt simulations for all distributions and the uncertainties from the data-driven method are smaller than those from the simulations. Since the tt template is a sub-sample of the signal data sample, there is a statistical correlation to the signal sample. This is estimated using pseudo datasets derived via Poisson variations of the signal and tt simulated samples and is found to be 15 % at N jets = 3 and 45 % at N jets = 6. The fit uncertainties are corrected to account for this correlation.  For lower multiplicities of N jets \u2264 2, where the fraction of tt is less than 5 %, simulations are used for the background estimate.",

The lepton systematic uncertainties are assumed to be correlated between bins of a given distribution, but independent between the two lepton channel measurements.

To estimate the effect due to the subtraction of W + heavy-flavour contamination in the tt template, the W +c cross section and the combined W +cc and W +bb cross sections are varied by factors of 1.3 and 0.9 respectively. These factors are obtained from fits to the selected data in two control regions, which have the jet requirements of one or two jets and at least one b-tagged jet; in these regions W + heavy flavour events dominate. This uncertainty, which is 3 % of the number of tt events for N jets \u2265 3, is largest at lower jet multiplicities, where the contribution from W + heavy flavour is most significant. Other small uncertainties include uncertainties on the b-tagging efficiencies and uncertainties on the bias in the tt distributions when applying b-tagging. The uncertainty on the number of tt events is roughly the same for the electron and muon channels. However, since there are fewer W \u2192 e\u03bd events passing the selection, the relative overall uncertainty on the cross section is larger in the electron channel.

Overall there is good agreement between the predictions and the data. For W + \u2265 1-jet events, the predictions from MEPS@NLO, SHERPA and to a much lesser extent BlackHat+SHERPA have a tendency to be higher than the data by one standard deviation of the experimental uncertainty at |y| > 3.5, while ALPGEN provides a better description. For W + \u2265 2-jets events, similar results are observed although the agreement with the data is better. HEJ provides a good description over the full rapidity range. Similar trends are also seen in measurements by the D0 collaboration [4]: SHERPA overestimates the data at high rapidities while ALPGEN provides a better description. Although ALPGEN uses a leading-order PDF, if the ALPGEN predictions are reweighted to the NLO PDF set CT10, there is no change in the level of agreement with data. An examination of the leading and second-leading jets in SHERPA at high rapidities indicates that these jets often originate from the parton shower and therefore disagreements between ALP-GEN and SHERPA most likely arise from the difference in parton showering models.

The data are, in general, in good agreement with the theoretical predictions, especially the predictions of BlackHat+SHERPA, MEPS@NLO and in some cases ALPGEN. Both the HEJ and SHERPA predictions tend to be above the data at high H T but the size of the deviations decreases at higher jet multiplicities. The differential cross sections as a function of the S T , where S T is defined as the summed scalar p T of all the jets in the event, are shown in Appendix B and yield similar conclusions, although agreement of the theory with the data is better at low S T than at low H T . Figure 25 shows the differential cross sections as a function of the difference in the azimuthal angle ( \u03c6 j1, j2 ) and Fig. 26 shows the differential cross sections as a function of the difference in the rapidity ( y j1, j2 ) between the two leading jets in events with at least two jets. The cross sections as a function of the angular separation ( R j1, j2 ) are shown in Fig. 27 and as a function of the dijet invariant mass in Fig. 28. These measurements are tests of hard parton radiation at large angles and matrix element/parton shower matching schemes. Jet production in the forward region can also be very sensitive to the tuning of the underlying event contribution.

However there is currently no theoretical prediction that is able to provide an accurate description of the data for all measured differential cross sections. Fixed-order predictions, such as BlackHat+SHERPA, provide overall a good description of the data, but have greater difficulty describing variables such as H T or S T in kinematic regions where the dominant production mechanism is dijet production, followed by the emission of a W boson from one of the quarks. Here better agreement is provided by extensions to fixed-order predictions, such as LoopSim or the Black-Hat+SHERPA exclusive sums method, or by formalisms that naturally include higher-order matrix element informa-tion within a Monte Carlo parton shower formalism, such as MEPS@NLO. The predictions of HEJ agree better with the data in regions where there is a large jet multiplicity and/or the jets tend to be separated by a wider rapidity interval. The leading-order matrix element calculations of ALPGEN and SHERPA provide a good description of the data for most differential cross sections but fail to describe jets with large rapidities and large angular separations.",
