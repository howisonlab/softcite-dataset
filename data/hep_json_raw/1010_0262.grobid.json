Stark, 14  Using 7.3 fb \u22121 of pp collisions collected by the D0 detector at the Fermilab Tevatron, we measure the distribution of the variable \u03c6 * \u03b7 , which probes the same physical effects as the Z/\u03b3 * boson transverse momentum, but is less susceptible to the effects of experimental resolution and efficiency. A QCD prediction is found to describe the general features of the \u03c6 * \u03b7 distribution, but is unable to describe its detailed shape or dependence on boson rapidity. A prediction that includes a broadening of transverse momentum for small values of the parton momentum fraction is strongly disfavored. Z/\u03b3 * bosons are produced at hadron colliders via quark-antiquark annihilation. Their decays to e + e \u2212 and \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 can be detected with little background and the phenomenology is simplified by the absence of color flow between the incoming partons and the products of the boson decay, thus providing an excellent testing ground for QCD predictions.

Resummation techniques [1] allow calculations of the distribution of p \u2113\u2113 T within the framework of perturbative QCD, even at relatively low p \u2113\u2113 T (e.g., p \u2113\u2113 T < 30 GeV). However, additional non-perturbative form factors, such as that of BLNY [2], must be determined in global fits to experimental data. An increase of these form factors for x < 10 \u22122 , where x is the parton momentum fraction, was suggested [3] to improve the description of hadron production observed in deep inelastic electron-proton scattering at HERA. Since vector boson production corresponds typically to parton x < 10 \u22122 at the LHC, these modified form factors would lead to a broadening of the expected vector boson trans-verse momentum distributions [4]. This \"small-x broadening\" would influence the measurement of the W boson mass as well as searches for Higgs bosons and physics beyond the standard model at the LHC. It is important to study quantitatively such x-dependencies at the Tevatron, where they can be probed using the dependence of the p \u2113\u2113 T distribution on boson rapidity, y [5]. At the Tevatron, bosons with |y| > 2 are particularly sensitive to the region x < 10 \u22122 .",

When using Monte Carlo (MC) to evaluate the correction factors, we apply the same kinematic selection criteria at the MC particle level as we apply in the selection of candidate events in the data [12]. For this purpose, MC particle level electrons are defined as the four-vector sum of any electrons and photons within a cone of \u2206R = (\u2206\u03b7) 2 + (\u2206\u03c6) 2 < 0.2 around an electron, where \u2206\u03b7 (\u2206\u03c6) is the distance in \u03b7 (\u03c6) from the particle level electron; this mimics the measurement of electron energy in the calorimeter. MC particle level muons are defined after QED final state radiation; this mimics the measurement of muon momentum in the tracking detector.

Candidate dielectron events are required to satisfy a trigger based on the identification of a single electron and to contain two clusters reconstructed in the calorimeter with a transverse and longitudinal shower profile consistent with that expected of an electron. The calorimeter is housed in three separate cryostats; this has the effect that electron identification is degraded in the region 1.1 < |\u03b7| < 1.5. Candidate dimuon events are required to satisfy a trigger based on the identification of a single muon and to contain two muons reconstructed either in the outer muon system, or as an energy deposit consistent with the passage of a minimum-ionizing particle in the calorimeter. In order to ensure an accurate measurement of the lepton directions at the point of production, the two lepton candidates are required to be matched to a pair of oppositely charged particle tracks reconstructed in the central tracking detectors. Candidate leptons resulting from misidentified hadrons or produced by the decay of hadrons are suppressed by requiring that they be isolated from other particles in the event and, in the case of electrons with |\u03b7| < 1.1, by requiring the energy measured in the calorimeter and the momentum measured in the central tracking detectors to be consistent. Contamination from cosmic ray muons is strongly suppressed by a requirement that the muons originate from the pp collision point and by rejecting events in which the two muon candidates are back to back in \u03b7.

The measured \u03c6 * \u03b7 distribution is, however, susceptible to modulations in \u03c6 of the lepton identification and trigger efficiencies, which result, e.g., from detector module boundaries in the calorimeter and muon systems. Particular care has been taken (a) in the choice of lepton identification criteria in order to minimize such modulations and (b) to ensure that such modulations are well simulated in the MC. For example, the requirements imposed on shower profile are much looser than those usually employed in electron identification within D0, because tight requirements are particularly inefficient in the regions close to module boundaries in the calorimeter. Similarly, the inclusion of muon candidates identified in the calorimeter reduces the effect of gaps between modules in the outer muon system. Accurate modelling of the angular resolution of the central tracking detectors is another crucial aspect of this analysis. The resolution in \u03c6 and \u03b7 is measured in the data using cosmic ray muons that traverse the detector, since these should produce events containing two tracks that are exactly back to back except for the effect of detector resolution.",

Therefore, simple bin-by-bin corrections of the \u03c6 * \u03b7 distribution are sufficient. In almost all \u03c6 * \u03b7 bins the total systematic uncertainty is substantially smaller than the statistical uncertainty. Figure 2 shows the corrected particle level \u03c6 * \u03b7 distributions together with predictions from ResBos. Figure 3 shows the ratio of the corrected \u03c6 * \u03b7 distributions to the ResBos predictions in both the dielectron and dimuon channels. The general shape of the distributions is broadly described by ResBos over the full range in \u03c6 * \u03b7 . However, the small statistical uncertainties resulting from the large dilepton data sets, combined with the fine binning and small systematic uncertainties resulting from the use of \u03c6 * \u03b7 as the analysing variable, reveal differences between the data and ResBos. Since the particle level definitions for electrons and muons to which the data are corrected are slightly different, Fig. 3 represents the most appropriate way to demonstrate the consistency of the dielectron and dimuon data. Given that the experimental corrections are very different in the two channels, this consistency represents a powerful cross check of the corrected distributions.",

That is, the width of the \u03c6 * \u03b7 distribution becomes narrower with increasing |y| faster in the data than is predicted by ResBos. This is the opposite of the behavior expected from the smallx broadening hypothesis [3,4]. Figure 3 confirms that the prediction from ResBos with small-x broadening is in poor agreement with data. It can also be seen that choosing the g 2 value (0.66 GeV 2 ) that best describes the average behavior of the data over all |y| bins and channels has little effect on the level of agreement with data.

The yellow band around the ResBos prediction represents the quadrature sum of uncertainty due to PDFs (evaluated using the CTEQ6.6 NLO error PDFs [15]) and the uncertainty due to the QCD scale (evaluated by varying the factorization and renormalization scales simultaneously by a factor of two). Also shown are the changes to the ResBos predictions when g2 is set to 0.66 GeV 2 (dotted blue line) and when the small-x broadening option is enabled (solid black line).",
