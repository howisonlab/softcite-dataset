The observed data are well described by the expected Standard Model backgrounds. The expected (observed) upper limit on the fiducial cross section for the production of events with a photon and large missing transverse momentum is 6.1 (5.3) fb at 95% confidence level. Exclusion limits are presented on models of new phenomena with large extra spatial dimensions, supersymmetric quarks, and direct pair production of dark-matter candidates.",

If these dimensions are compactified, a series of massive graviton modes results. These gravitons may be invisible to the ATLAS detector, but if the graviton is produced in association with a photon, the detector signature is a \u03b3 \u00fe E miss T event, as illustrated in Fig. 1. Although the presence of DM is well established [9], its possible particle nature remains a mystery. A popular candidate is a weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) denoted \u03c7, which has an interaction strength with SM particles at the level of the weak interaction. If the WIMPs interact with quarks via a heavy mediator, they could be pair produced in collider events. The \u03c7\u03c7 pair would be invisible, but \u03b3 \u00fe E miss T events can be produced via radiation of an initial-state photon in qq\u03c7\u03c7 interactions [10].",

            "text": "As observations so far do not provide strong constraints on the nature of the WIMPs and the theoretical framework to which they belong, it is particularly interesting to study model-independent effective field theories (EFT) with various forms of interaction between the WIMPs and the Standard Model particles [10]. In this framework, the mediator is effectively integrated out from the propagator and the production mechanism at the LHC energy scale is considered as a contact interaction, as illustrated in Fig. 2. Several EFT operators for which the WIMP is a Dirac fermion are used as a representative set following the nomenclature of Ref. [10]: D5 (vector), D8 (axial vector), and D9 (tensor). The interactions of SM and DM particles are described by two parameters: the DM particle mass m \u03c7 and the suppression scale (M \u00c3 ) of the heavy mediator. In an ultraviolet complete theory, the contact interaction would be replaced by an interaction via an explicit mediator V; the suppression scale is linked to the mediator mass m V by the relation M \u00c3 \u00bc m V = ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi ffi g f g \u03c7 p , where g f and g \u03c7 represent the coupling factors of the mediator to SM particles and WIMPs, respectively. However, as the typical momentum transfer in LHC collisions can reach the scale of the microscopic interaction, it is also crucial to probe specific models that involve the explicit production of the intermediate state, as shown in Fig. 3. In this case, the interaction is effectively described by four parameters: m \u03c7 , m V , the width of the mediator \u0393, and the overall FIG. 1. Graviton (G) production in models of large extra dimensions.",

The ID is surrounded by a thin superconducting solenoid providing a 2 T magnetic field. A high-granularity lead/liquid-argon sampling electromagnetic calorimeter covers the region j\u03b7j < 3.2. An iron/scintillator-tile calorimeter provides hadronic coverage in the range j\u03b7j < 1.7. The liquid-argon technology is also used for the hadronic calorimeters in the end-cap region 1.5 < j\u03b7j < 3.2 and for electromagnetic and hadronic measurements in the forward region up to j\u03b7j \u00bc 4.9. The muon spectrometer (MS) surrounds the calorimeters.

I, as well as to suppress the background from SM processes. This signal region also provides good sensitivity to the other models described in Sec. I. Events in the SR are required to have E miss T > 150 GeV and a photon with p \u03b3 T > 125 GeV and j\u03b7j < 1.37. It is also required that the photon and E miss T are not overlapped in azimuth: \u0394\u03d5\u00f0\u03b3; E miss T \u00de > 0.4. Events with more than one jet or with a jet with \u0394\u03d5\u00f0jet; E miss T \u00de < 0.4 are rejected. Events with one jet are retained to increase the signal acceptance and reduce systematic uncertainties related to the modeling of initial-state radiation. Events are required to have no electron (p T > 7 GeV, j\u03b7j < 2.47) and no muon (p T > 6 GeV, j\u03b7j < 2.5). The lepton veto mainly rejects W=Z events with charged leptons in the final state. For events satisfying these criteria, the E miss T trigger efficiency is 0.99 AE 0.01, as determined using events selected with the e=\u03b3 trigger. The final data sample contains 521 events, where 319 and 202 events have zero and one jet, respectively.",

Uncertainties on the scale and resolution of the calorimeter energy deposits not associated with high-p T physics objects affect the calculation of the E miss T and generate an uncertainty of 0.3% on the background prediction. Uncertainties on the PDF are evaluated by following, for the CT10 and MSTW2008LO PDF sets, the PDF4LHC recommendations [66]. The Hessian method is used to obtain asymmetric uncertainties at 68% confidence level (C.L.). In addition, to obtain inter-PDF uncertainties, the results are then compared with those obtained with the NNPDF set. Renormalization and factorization scale uncertainties are also taken into account by increasing and decreasing the scales used in the MC generators by a factor of 2. PDF and scale uncertainties contribute 0.7% to the background prediction uncertainty. After the fit, the uncertainty on the jet energy scale due to corrections for pileup, and the uncertainties on the trigger efficiency and luminosity [67], are found to have a negligible impact on the background estimation. The final total background prediction systematic uncertainty is about 5%, while the statistical uncertainty is about 6%.

Only uncertainties affecting A \u00d7 \u03f5 are included in the statistical analysis; uncertainties affecting the cross section are indicated as bands on observed limits and written as \u03c3 theo . For the EFT and simplified-model DM samples, scale uncertainties are evaluated by varying the renormalization, factorization, and matching scales in MADGRAPH by a factor of 2. For the ADD samples, the PYTHIA 8 renormalization and factorization scale parameters are varied independently to 0.5 and 2.0. For these samples, the ISR and FSR signal uncertainties are assessed by varying the PYTHIA 8 parameters, as done in Ref. [71]. For the squark model described in Sec. I, systematic uncertainties arising from the treatment of ISR/FSR are studied with MC event samples by varying the value of \u03b1 s ; the renormalization and factorization scales and the MADGRAPH/PYTHIA matching parameter are also varied to estimate the related uncertainties. Radiation uncertainties are typically less than 10%, PDF uncertainties less than 30%, and scale uncertainties less than 20%.",

Values of M \u00c3 up to 760, 760, and 1010 GeV are excluded for the D5, D8, and D9 operators, respectively. As already mentioned, the effective field theory model becomes a poor approximation when the momentum transferred in the interaction Q tr is comparable to the mass of the intermediate state 10,72]. In order to illustrate the sensitivity to the unknown ultraviolet completion of the theory, limits computed retaining only simulated events with Q tr < m V are also shown, for a value  of the coupling ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi ffi g f g \u03c7 p equal to either unity or the maximum value (4\u03c0) that allows the perturbative approach to be valid. This procedure is referred to as truncation. As can be seen in Figs. 10-12, the truncated limits nearly overlap with the nontruncated limits for a 4\u03c0 coupling. For unit coupling, the truncated limits are less stringent than the nontruncated limits at low m \u03c7 , and the analysis loses sensitivity for m \u03c7 > 100 (200) GeV for the D5 and D8 (D9) operators. In this case, for the D5 and D8 operators, as no sample was generated between m \u03c7 \u00bc 50 GeV and m \u03c7 \u00bc 100 GeV, the limit is only shown up to m \u03c7 \u00bc 50 GeV; for the D9 operator, as no sample was generated between m \u03c7 \u00bc 100 GeV and m \u03c7 \u00bc 200 GeV, the limit is only shown up to m \u03c7 \u00bc 100 GeV. These lower limits on M \u00c3 can be translated into upper limits on the WIMP-nucleon interaction cross section as a function of m \u03c7 using Eqs. 4and (5) ofRef. [10]. Results are shown in Fig. 13 for spin-independent (D5) and spin-dependent (D8, D9) \u03c7-nucleon interactions and are compared to measurements from various DM search experiments [73][74][75][76][77][78][79][80][81][82][83][84][85]. The search for dark-matter pair production in association with a \u03b3 at the LHC extends the limits on the \u03c7-nucleon scattering cross section into the low-mass region m \u03c7 < 10 GeV where the astroparticle experiments have less sensitivity due to the very low-energy recoils such low-mass DM particles would induce.",
