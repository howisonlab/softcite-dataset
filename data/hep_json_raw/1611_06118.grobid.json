Having the second detector in Korea would benefit almost all areas of neutrino oscillation physics, mainly due to longer baselines.

Leptonic charge-parity (CP) symmetry violation sensitivity is improved, especially when the CP is non-maximally violated. The larger matter effect at Korean candidate sites significantly enhances sensitivities to non-standard interactions of neutrinos and mass ordering determination. Current studies indicate the best sensitivity is obtained at Mt. Bisul (1088 km baseline, 1.3 \u2022 OAA). Thanks to a larger (1000 m) overburden than the first detector site, clear improvements to sensitivities for solar and supernova relic neutrino searches are expected.",

            "text": "The proposed Hyper-Kamiokande (Hyper-K or HK) experiment [1] builds upon the highly successful Super-Kamiokande (Super-K or SK) detector [2] by constructing two large water-Cherenkov detectors with 16.8 times the fiducial volume of SK to pursue a rich program of neutrino (astro)physics and proton decay. The Hyper-K design proposes the construction of two identical detectors in stages with 187 kt (fiducial mass) per detector. The first one will be constructed near the current Super-K site, 295 km away and 2.5 \u2022 off-axis from the J-PARC neutrino beam used by the T2K experiment. The second one is currently under consideration to be built in Korea where the J-PARC neutrino beam is still reachable. The long-baseline neutrino program observing the J-PARC neutrino beam at Hyper-K aims for a definitive observation of CP violation (CPV) in neutrino oscillations, that may result from an irreducible phase \u03b4 CP in the neutrino mixing matrix. Hyper-K will make precise measurements of \u03b4 CP and other oscillation parameters, such as \u03b8 23 and m 2 32 , and will have sufficient statistics to make \"shape\" tests of the three-flavor mixing paradigm. These measurements are valuable in elucidating the new physics responsible for neutrino mass and mixing and its potential connections to leptogenesis in the early universe.",

Such a configuration can improve neutrino oscillation physics sensitivities in Hyper-K in a number of ways: it can break degeneracies related to the unknown mass ordering, the mixing parameter \u03b8 23 , and the CP-violating phase \u03b4 CP ; it has better precision (especially on \u03b4 CP ) in important regions of the parameter space; and it can serve to mutually reduce the impact of systematic uncertainties (both known and unknown) across all measurements. It also provides an opportunity to test the preferred oscillation model in a regime not probed with existing experiments. Constraints on (or evidence of) exotic neutrino models, such as non-standard interactions with matter, are also expected to be significantly enhanced by the use of a longer baseline configuration for a second detector.",

Originally, an idea for a two-baseline experiment with a second detector in Korea was discussed by several authors, pointing out possible improvements for measurements of CP violation and mass hierarchy [5][6][7][8][9]. Three international workshops were held in Korea and Japan in 2005  [10]. At the time, the mixing angle of \u03b8 13 was not yet known, and therefore the required detector size and mass could not be determined. Now, more realistic studies and a detector design are possible due to the precisely measured value of \u03b8 13 [11][12][13][14][15][17][18][19]. ",

The 30 GeV (kinetic energy) proton beam is extracted from the J-PARC main ring (MR) by single-turn fast extraction and transported to the production target after being deflected about 90 \u2022 by 28 superconducting combined-function magnets to direct the beam toward Kamioka. The beam pulse consists of eight bunches spaced 581 ns apart to give a pulse of duration 4.2 \u03bcs. As of 2017, the repetition period of the pulses is 2.48 s. The production target is a graphite rod 26 mm in diameter and 90 cm long (corresponding to two interaction lengths). About 80% of the incoming protons interact in the target. The secondary pions (and kaons) from the target are focused by three consecutive electromagnetic horns operated by a 250 kA pulsed current. It is expected that by the time of Hyper-K, the horn currents will be increased to 320 kA. The focused pions and kaons enter a decay volume (DV) of length 96 m filled with helium gas, and decay in flight into neutrinos and charged leptons. The beam dump, which consists of graphite blocks of about 3.15 m thickness followed by iron plates of 2.5 m total thickness, is placed at the end of the DV to absorb remnant hadrons. Muon monitors (MUMONs) are placed just behind the beam dump to monitor on a spill-byspill basis the intensity and the profile of muons with initial energy over 5 GeV which pass through the beam dump.",

This increased sensitivity contributes significantly to the major goals of the Hyper-K experiment such as clean proton decay searches via p \u2192 e + + \u03c0 0 and p \u2192\u03bd + K + decay modes and the observation of supernova electron antineutrinos. The inner detector region of the single tank is viewed by 40,000 PMTs, corresponding to a PMT density of 40% photo-cathode coverage (the same as that of Super-K). The detector will be instrumented with front-end electronics and a readout network/computer system that is capable of high-efficiency data acquisition for two successive events in which Michel electron events follow muon events with a mean interval of 2 \u03bcs. It is also able to record data from the vast number of neutrinos that would come from a nearby supernova in a nominal time period of 10 s. Similar to Super-K, an outer detector (OD) with a layer width of 1-2 m is envisaged. In addition to enabling additional physics, this would help to constrain the external background. The photo-coverage of the OD can be sparser, and use smaller PMTs than those used for the ID. ",

This reflects the benefit of high-energy neutrinos for resolving the mass ordering. At the peak energy, however, the normal ordering enhances the antineutrino probabilities relative to neutrinos, which is opposite to the amplitude-dominated effect seen at the first maximum. This is due to the matter effect also changing the effective oscillation length for neutrinos and antineutrinos, so that the neutrinos are closer to an appearance minimum than are antineutrinos of the same energy. Unlike a first-maximum experiment, the experimental signature determining the mass ordering uses shape as well as rate information, and the impact of systematic uncertainties (most obviously on neutrino versus antineutrino cross sections and detection efficiencies) is correspondingly different.

For the energy peak at Bohyun (which is close to the oscillation maximum), the overlap between the normal and inverted ordering ellipses is still large, but the effect for the higher and lower energy ellipses is quite different, so information provided by the spectrum of observed events is less degenerate, and correspondingly more interesting, than it is for first-maxima experiments.

The variations of the 1Re spectra in neutrino mode and antineutrino mode for different \u03b4 CP values at different detector locations are shown in Fig. 15. Similarly, the asymmetries of predicted 1Re spectra between neutrino mode and antineutrino mode as a function of \u03b4 CP are shown in Fig. 16. For the detectors in Korea, the magnitude of the potential neutrino/antineutrino asymmetry is larger and this effect can partially compensate for the larger statistical uncertainties at the 3.7 times longer baseline. The purely statistical separations between the maximally CP-violating and CP-conserving hypotheses are listed in Table 5, where it is assumed that the mass ordering is known. The 2.0 \u2022 off-axis slice has the strongest statistical separation between CP-violating and CP-conserving hypotheses. Here, the detectors at 1100 km do not match the significance for CP violation discovery of the 295 km detectors as suggested in Sect. 3.1. The lower significance is due to a few factors. First, the 1100 km baseline means that the second oscillation maximum is at a higher energy than the first oscillation maximum at the 295 km baseline, and the neutrino flux is decreased by a factor of 14 at 1100 km compared with 295 km. The width of the second oscillation maximum is also narrower than the first oscillation maximum, so for a 2.0 \u2022 off-axis beam, a larger fraction of events do not have energies very close to the second oscillation maximum. The introduction of the matter effect also decreases the CP violation significance as it introduces degeneracies between the mass ordering and \u03b4 CP . Despite the lower statistical significance at the 1100 km baseline, the overall significance with a second detector in Korea is higher when systematic uncertainties are accounted for, as is shown in the sensitivity studies presented later in this section.",

First, the difference in observed neutrino-mode and antineutrino-mode 1Re candidates is calculated as a function of reconstructed energy. This difference is calculated for both the normal and inverted hierarchies, and the difference between hierarchies is taken. It can be seen that the neutrino-antineutrino difference varies differently with reconstructed energy for the normal and inverted hierarchies. For the normal mass ordering, the neutrinos are enhanced in the < 0.8 GeV and > 1.1 GeV regions and diminished in the 0.8-1.0 GeV region relative to the inverted mass ordering. This relative difference is nearly independent of the true value of \u03b4 CP , as illustrated in Fig. 17   While the CP-even and CP-odd interference terms in the electron (anti)neutrino appearance probability are enhanced at the 1100 km baseline due to the 21 dependence, no such enhancement is present in the muon (anti)neutrino survival probability. Hence, the statistical constraint from the 1R\u03bc samples on m 2 32 and sin 2 2\u03b8 23 will be stronger for the detector at L = 295 km due to the larger statistics. The Korean detector, however, has the unique feature of measuring the oscillation pattern over two periods, confirming the oscillatory behavior of the neutrino transitions. Figure 18 shows the ratio of the expected spectrum after oscillations to the expected spectrum without oscillations. For all three Korean detector locations, the oscillation pattern over two periods may be observed. While the measurement in Hyper-K provides higher statistics, only one period of oscillations can be observed.",

To evaluate the impact of the Korean detector on the Hyper-K sensitivities, it is necessary to implement a systematic error model that takes into account what are expected to be the dominant systematic errors for Hyper-K.

Near these values, the derivative of sin(\u03b4 CP ) approaches zero, degrading the sensitivity to the CP-odd term in the oscillation probability. Here, the CP-even term, which depends on cos(\u03b4 CP ), may contribute to the precision measurement of the phase.

Here, 13 \u2022 is chosen since it is expected to be the ultimate precision of Hyper-K after a 10 yr\u00d71.3 MW exposure with two tanks. It can be seen that the change to \u03b4 CP by 13 \u2022 largely affects the spectrum through the cos(\u03b4 CP ) term, causing a downward shift in energy with little change to the overall normalization. Figure 20 also shows the effect of an energy scale shift by \u22120.5% for comparison.

As is expected based on Fig. 17, the significance is largest for the configuration with the Korean detector at 1.5 \u2022 offaxis since the more on-axis position gives more events in the 1-2 GeV range where the matter effect is large. For this configuration, the significance to reject the wrong mass ordering is greater than 6 \u03c3 for most values of \u03b4 CP , and greater than 5 \u03c3 for all values of \u03b4 CP . The significance of the wrong mass ordering rejection degrades as the Korean detector is moved to more off-axis locations. However, even the configuration with the 2.5 \u2022 off-axis Korean detector has 3 \u03c3 rejection sensitivity for most values of \u03b4 CP , and improved sensitivity over the configuration with one (both) detector(s) in Japan for all (most) values of \u03b4 CP . Based on this study, it is clear that the sensitivity may be improved further by adding events above 1 GeV in reconstructed energy. This may be achieved by moving to a more on-axis position (see Mt. Bisul) or by including multi-ring event reconstruction that allows the inclusion of higher-energy events with one or more detected pions. Multi-ring event reconstruction will be the topic of a future study. Based on this study of the configurations with a detector in Korea, the accelerator neutrinos can provide an alternative measurement of the mass ordering that is complementary to the measurement using atmospheric neutrinos. By combining the two measurements, an even stronger constraint can be obtained, and better sensitivity can be achieved earlier in the lifetime of Hyper-K. 34   The plots showing the significance to reject the CP-conserving hypotheses are in Fig. 24, and Fig. 25 shows the fraction of \u03b4 CP values for which a given significance can be achieved. The fractions of true \u03b4 CP values for which 3 \u03c3 and 5 \u03c3 sensitivity are achieved are listed in Table 7. When the mass ordering is already known, all four two-detector configurations have similar sensitivity, but the best sensitivity is available when the Korean detector is placed at 2.0 \u2022 off-axis. It should be mentioned that in this study, it is assumed that the mass ordering is determined by external experiments and Hyper-K atmospheric neutrinos with a significance greater than the CP conservation rejection significance being studied. Compared to a single detector in Japan, the configuration with a second detector in 35  Korea at 2.0 \u2022 off-axis has 3 \u03c3 (5 \u03c3 ) sensitivity for an additional 7%-8% (13%-14%) of \u03b4 CP values depending on the mass ordering. When the mass ordering is only determined by the accelerator neutrinos, the configuration with the Korean detector at 1.5 \u2022 off-axis gives the largest fraction of true \u03b4 CP values for which a 5 \u03c3 discovery is possible. This is true because this configuration has the best sensitivity to determine the mass ordering, breaking the mass ordering-\u03b4 CP degeneracy. For the case with the 1.5 \u2022 off-axis configuration, the dependence of the CP violation discovery sensitivity on the relative fraction of antineutrino-mode to neutrino-mode operation has been evaluate for ratios ranging from 3 : 1 (default) to 1 : 3. The fraction of \u03b4 CP values with a 5 \u03c3 discovery changes by only 0.01 depending on the relative fraction of antineutrino-mode and neutrino-mode operation.",

In fact, there may be a reduced sensitivity with one detector in Korea due to the lower statistics at the longer baseline. We have studied the sensitivity to m 2 32 and sin 2 \u03b8 23 as well as the \u03b8 23 octant determination in configurations that include detectors in Japan and Korea or detectors only in Japan. Figure 33 shows the 2 \u03c3 sensitivities for the m 2 32 and sin 2 \u03b8 23 parameter determination for different true values of these parameters. There is a reduction in the sensitivity when a configuration with a Japanese and Korean detector is used relative to a configuration with two Japanese detectors, but the reduction in sensitivity is not large.

These neutrinos are produced in decays of particles emerging from the interaction of primary cosmic rays with nuclei in the atmosphere. Indeed, the production mechanism is identical to that of beam neutrinos, with the notable exception that the lack of an absorber results in a significant fraction of \u03bd e and\u03bd e in the flux. Up to \u223c10 GeV, the ratio of muon-to electron-type neutrinos is roughly 2 : 1, with the fraction of muon neutrinos increasing at higher energies. Since the primary cosmic ray flux spans several orders of magnitude and is roughly isotropic about the Earth, the resulting atmospheric neutrino spectrum covers an equally wide range of energies and a given detector can expect to observe neutrinos with a variety of pathlengths from O(10) km, for neutrinos produced overhead, to \u223c10,000 km, for those produced on the opposite side of the planet. Importantly, these events will be accumulated at both detectors in Japan and Korea in similar proportion, modulo differences in the atmospheric densities and the local geomagnetic fields.",

Neutrinos traversing the core of the Earth pass through a matter profile whose density varies from 1 to 13 g cm \u22123 , which induces a parametric oscillation resonance for energies between 2 and 10 GeV. For neutrinos experiencing this effect the \u03bd \u03bc \u2192 \u03bd e (appearance channel) oscillation probability can be as large as 50% (Fig. 35). This effect depends on   both the sign of the mass hierarchy and whether the neutrino is a particle or antiparticle; for a normal (inverted) mass hierarchy only neutrinos (antineutrinos) undergo these oscillations. Sensitivity to the mass hierarchy is obtained by studying the upward-going electron neutrino event rate in this energy region.

Though there are common systematic error effects between the two samples from the cross section and detector modeling, the disparate energy regimes and flux systematics allow for a nearly independent study of oscillations. More importantly, the atmospheric neutrino data are accumulated continuously and independently of the beam, such that the combination of the two samples provides improved sensitivity on shorter time scales. In this section we present a combined analysis of beam and atmospheric neutrino data assuming a Hyper-K detector in Japan (JD) and at the Mt. Bisul site (off-axis angle 1.3 \u2022 ) and compare with sensitivities assuming two detectors in Japan (JD\u00d72). The treatment of the atmospheric neutrino samples and their systematic errors follows that of Super-Kamiokande, with no assumed improvements (cf. the discussion in Ref. [44]). Figure 36 shows the sensitivity to the mass hierarchy for the combined analysis using the same test statistic as Eq. 5. After ten years of running, the expected ability to reject the wrong mass hierarchy is better than \u03c7 2 = 7. Atmospheric neutrinos by themselves provide sensitivity better than \u03c7 2 > 3 for all currently allowed values of sin 2 \u03b8 23 and have comparable sensitivity to the beam measurement at the Korean detector for the largest values of this parameter. Though the combined JD and Mt. Bisul beam measurement has better sensitivity than the atmospheric neutrino measurement alone, when all of the samples are combined the sensitivity improves further. The power of this improvement manifests as an earlier realization of the hierarchy, as shown in the left panel of Fig. 37. Within two years of operation the sensitivity will exceed \u03c7 2 > 4. Sensitivity to sin 2 \u03b8 23 for the combined analysis and its components appears in Fig. 38. Here, the test statistic reflects the ability to reject the incorrect octant as",

The latitude, longitude, and altitude of each of the simulated locations are summarized in Table 8. For both Mt. Bisul and Mt. Bohyun, simulations assuming 820 m and 1000 m overburdens have been performed using muons that are generated at the surface following the parameterization in Ref. [49].

Table 9 summarizes the calculated muon flux ( ) and average energy (E \u03bc ) at the Mt. Bisul, Mt. Bohyun, Hyper-K (Tochibora), and Super-K sites.

Further, with 1000 m overburdens, the Korean sites are expected to have similar muon fluxes and energies as those observed at Super-K. For the shallower 820 m overburden the flux is expected to increase by more than a factor of two according to Table 9). Using this information the muon flux ratio at Mt.

The isotope yield per muon track length, Y , depends on the muon energy, which increases with larger overburdens. As a result, the isotope yield per muon becomes larger for deeper experimental sites. For the 1000 m overburden case the average muon energy is similar to that of Super-K, and thus the ratio of their isotope yields per muon are similar: 1.03 \u00b1 0.21.

In this case, the signal efficiency is 79% (56%) for neutrinos reconstructed with energies between 17.5 and 20 MeV and 90% (75%) between 20 and 26 MeV for the 1000 m (820 m) overburden site.

This would manifest as a distortion of the energy spectrum of neutrinos or antineutrinos depending on the mass hierarchy, which can be observed under favorable conditions [58,60]. Having two geographically separated detector locations increases the likelihood of the Earth shadowing the neutrino flux reaching one of the detectors. In addition, comparing the energy spectra in two detectors that observe different shadowing scenarios (see Fig. 43) may make it easier to disentangle matter effects from supernova burst neutrino properties.",

Super-K has demonstrated this physics potential through the world's best constraints on spin-dependent scattering of dark matter with matter [61]. Hyper-K can improve upon Super-K's results and is expected to provide the best indirect dark matter search sensitivities for masses below 100 GeV. As the background to a neutrino signal from dark matter annihilation in the Sun comes from atmospheric neutrinos, a benefit from a second site could come from reduced systematic uncertainties associated with atmospheric neutrino fluxes. A neutrino signal originating from the decays of the dark matter annihilation products in the Sun is also accompanied by a high-multiplicity stopped meson decay low-energy neutrino signal from hadronic showers of the annihilation products in the center of the Sun [62][63][64]. The expected signal consists of neutrinos of a few tens of MeV from muon decays at rest in the Sun, as well as neutrino line signals at 29.8 MeV and 235.5 MeV from two-body charged pion and kaon decays at rest. The possible addition of gadolinium in water [65] would reduce (invisible muon) backgrounds significantly for this signal, which can very efficiently be detected through the inverse beta decay reaction [62].",

Due to the distance between the Korean (KD) and Japanese (JD) detector locations, both detectors could observe a supernova neutrino burst with different Earth shadowing. In scenario 1 (solid black arrows), one detector would observe an unshadowed flux, while neutrinos detected in the other detector would travel through the Earth for up to 1800 km. In scenario 2 (dashed purple arrows), one detector would be shadowed by the Earth's mantle (yellow) only, while the other detector would be shadowed by the mantle and the outer core (blue). While the resulting difference in path length is small, up to 4400 km of the path of neutrinos reaching one detector would go through the outer core instead of the mantle. Since the matter density of the outer core is much larger than that of the mantle, the matter effect along these two paths would be markedly different. Using an online tool for calculating Earth crossing probabilities for different detector locations, we find that the combined probability of these two scenarios is 6.4% [59].

In most cases, configurations with a large detector in both countries have significantly improved sensitivity to such types of new physics, relative to having the equivalent detector mass in just one of them. Not only do the two baselines provide a more complete measure of the neutrino spectrum, and hence distortions arising from new physics, but they also provide distance L/E ranges to constrain scenarios with non-oscillating (or with oscillating admixtures) L/E effects. See Tables I and II and Fig. 6 of Ref. [66] for more details. As one example, the expected sensitivity to an enhanced matter effect caused by non-standard interactions is presented in the next section.",

The quasi-elastic scattering cross section is nearly constant above 1 GeV, while the rate of other processes that include pion production increases. Higher statistics in the >1 GeV region may be achieved by including candidate events with evidence of pion production in addition to the charged lepton. These additional candidate events may include events where a Michel electron from a pion decay chain is detected, or where a pion is directly detected by the reconstruction of a second visible ring in the detector.

For this purpose we assume that the values of these parameters are zero and present our results as limits in the \u03b5 ee -|\u03b5 e\u03c4 | plane. The assumed true value of \u03c6 31 is zero and it has been marginalized over in the presentation of the results. The PMNS oscillation parameters 54  In Fig. 44, we present the sensitivities with PMNS parameters held at their currently favored values: \u03b8 23 = 45 \u2022 and \u03b4 CP = 270 \u2022 . In the left, middle, and right panels the 3 \u03c3 allowed region is given in the \u03b5 ee -|\u03b5 e\u03c4 |, \u03b5 ee -\u03b5 \u03c4 \u03c4 , and \u03b5 \u03c4 \u03c4 -|\u03b5 e\u03c4 | planes, respectively. In each panel the NSI parameters that are not plotted have been marginalized over. Here, and elsewhere unless otherwise noted, the marginalization is made over the ranges \u22124 to +4 for \u03b5 ee , 0 to 2 for |\u03b5 e\u03c4 |, and \u22121 to +1 for \u03b5 \u03c4 \u03c4 . We have additionally checked that the \u03c7 2 minima do indeed always appear within these chosen ranges of \u03b5 \u03b1\u03b2 . The purple curve in each panel shows the allowed region when m 2 21 and m 2 31 are kept fixed in the test spectrum. The green dotted curves and blue dashed curves show the effect of marginalizing over these parameters. It is clear that the uncertainty in m 2 31 has no effect on the sensitivity, whereas the allowed region increases slightly when we marginalize over m 2 21 . To demonstrate how the sensitivity is improved by using a Korean detector, we also show the equivalent result for the JD\u00d72 configuration in Fig. 44 (red curves). It can be seen that this configuration provides significantly weaker constraints. Indeed, in this case it is necessary to extend the marginalization range of \u03b5 \u03c4 \u03c4 out to \u00b14 since there is still a significant posterior probability outside the original region. From all three panels, we note that the sensitivity of the KD+JD (T2HKK) configuration is far better than the equivalent JD\u00d72 configuration, let alone the baseline single-tank design. This is essentially the same effect as seen in the standard PMNS oscillation model, with the longer baselines and the higher energies both enhancing the matter effect.",

Sensitivity to constraining the CP phases benefits explicitly from having two detectors at different baselines in the T2HKK configuration. To illustrate this, Fig. 48 shows the contribution of each detector separately assuming \u03b8 23 = 45 \u2022 , \u03b4 CP = 270 \u2022 , and \u03c6 31 = 180 \u2022 .

This is illustrated by the green contour, which shows the capability a single detector in Kamioka assuming that the NSI parameters \u03b5 ee , |\u03b5 e\u03c4 |, and \u03b5 \u03c4 \u03c4 are non-zero, but known. First, this demonstrates that a single measurement at the first PMNS oscillation maximum is seriously limited by degeneracies in the extended model that cannot be untangled. Secondly, although the green contour shows a precise measurement, there is a degeneracy between the two available CP parameters shown by the correlated  nature of the allowed region. The degeneracy is lifted by measurements at the Korean detector. Indeed, the T2HKK configuration, shown in red, yields a more precise measurement even though the NSI parameters are considered unknown in the analysis. In this sense an analysis that allows for the possibility of deviations from the PMNS model can benefit much more from the extra information obtained using multiple baselines than it would from simply improving the available statistics for a single-baseline measurement.",

In addition, the sensitivity to constrain the NSI amplitudes does not vary much with the assumed values of \u03b8 23 and \u03b4 CP . The achievable precision on the phases does depend upon the true values of \u03b4 CP and \u03c6 31 , and for particular combinations it can be much harder to determine the value of \u03c6 31 . However, the unique two-detector configuration of the T2HKK setup is more powerful than a single detector, and would be extremely helpful in measuring the neutrino CP phases if NSI exist in nature. In studying the effect of systematics, it is found that T2HKK is not insensitive to the magnitude of the systematic errors, but that while the overall measurement is improved by reduction of the systematic uncertainties, the systematics are most important when considering sensitivity to specific degenerate parameter combinations.",

The second detector improves physics sensitivities, from beam neutrino physics to astroparticle physics, due to increased statistics. In particular, searches for proton decay provide a strong motivation for having two detectors. According to our sensitivity studies, by locating the second detector in Korea the physics sensitivities are further improved due to the longer baseline (\u223c1100 km) and the possibility of a larger overburden (1000 m) at the candidate sites. These sites cover a range of possible off-axis angles to the J-PARC beam, between 1 \u2022 and 3 \u2022 , depending on the site. With the longer baseline in Korea both the first and second oscillation maxima of the PMNS neutrino appearance probability are reachable. The longer baseline of the Korean sites enhances the CP-violating component of the oscillation probability, and resolves parameter combinations between the neutrino mass ordering and CP-violating phase that would be nearly degenerate when measuring only at the Japanese site with beam neutrinos. This is a unique opportunity afforded by the J-PARC neutrino beam. By adding atmospheric neutrinos, neutrino mass ordering determination is improved at both the Japan and Korean sites.",

These have compared different configurations of Hyper-K detector(s) in Japan and Korea for ten years of operation without staging and with 1.3 MW beam power for \u03bd : \u03bd = 1 : 3. In general, the configuration with one detector in Japan and one in Korea at a smaller off-axis angle gives better sensitivity overall than two detectors in Japan. Based on this systematic error model, the benefits of a smaller off-axis angle seem to outweigh the extra uncertainties of using a higher beam energy. Overall, the Mt. Bisul site, with its 1088 km baseline, 1.3 \u2022 off-axis angle, and 1084 m overburden, is the leading candidate location. Although the smaller off-axis angle introduces more \u03c0 0 -production high-energy tail of the beam flux, the large value of \u03b8 13 makes this less important and the sensitivity to the CP phase is improved over the nominal Hyper-K design.",

The coverage fraction for establishing CP violation at 5 \u03c3 improves from 47% (55%) to 60% if the mass ordering is known from independent measurements, and the improvement is much larger otherwise. The significance of a CP violation discovery is improved relative to having two detectors in Japan for 0 < sin \u03b4 CP < 1, though the improvement is marginal for values near 1 unless the mass ordering is still unknown at the time of the experiment. The significance at which the wrong mass ordering can be rejected for any value of \u03b4 CP improves from 0.7 \u03c3 (1 \u03c3 ) for the nominal Hyper-K design (two detectors in Japan) to 5.5 \u03c3 at T2HKK using beam neutrino data alone. In contrast, relative to two detectors in Japan the sensitivity of T2HKK to the atmospheric mixing parameters is weaker due to the reduction in statistics over the longer baseline to Korea.

This common practice is an over-simplification; although long-baseline oscillation experiments have negligible variation in the baseline, the neutrino energy typically ranges over at least a factor of two, and often more. For the first generation of \u03bd eappearance experiments (that is to say, T2K and NO\u03bdA) that use a narrow-band beam peaking near the energy of the first oscillation maximum this is tolerable, since the first period of the oscillation runs from half the peak energy up to infinity. When considering these experiments there are two obvious \"fixes\": Either use one energy (typically the peak energy) as a stand-in for the entire spectrum of measured neutrinos, or integrate the probability over the expected (without oscillations) spectrum of events.",

But this is not often done, as integrating over the full spectrum (much of which has lower appearance probabilities) significantly reduces the sensitivity of the experiment. On the other hand, the former method does not have any problems with averaging, but the number of events for which the ellipses are a good approximation is a small fraction of the total. This makes it difficult to summarize the overall sensitivity of an experiment in a correct way.",
