It is primarily evaluated using events containing a pair of muons from the decay of Z bosons to cover the intermediate momentum range between 25 GeV and 100 GeV. Overall, the efficiency of the single-muon triggers is about 68% in the barrel region and 85% in the endcap region. The p T range for efficiency determination is extended by using muons from decays of J/\u03c8 mesons, W bosons, and top quarks. The performance in HI collision data is measured and shows good agreement with the results obtained in pp collisions. The muon trigger shows uniform and stable performance in good agreement with the prediction of a detailed simulation. Dedicated multi-muon triggers with kinematic selections provide the backbone to beauty, quarkonia, and low-mass physics studies. The design, evolution and performance of these triggers are discussed in detail.",

            "text": "In order to address a wide variety of physics topologies, ATLAS has developed a suite of triggers designed to select muons. A single-muon trigger with a p T threshold of 26 GeV is used by many physics analyses. In addition, muon triggers in combination with electrons, \u03c4-leptons, jets and missing transverse momentum, as well as multi-muon triggers with lower muon p T thresholds, increase the sensitivity for various physics phenomena which benefit from a lower p T threshold. For the BLS programme studying beauty, quarkonia, and low-mass physics, various low-p T multi-muon triggers are used with a special configuration that allows a high trigger efficiency for non-prompt muons.1",

            "text": "During the LHC Run 2 (2015-2018), the ATLAS experiment collected pp collision data at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV with a maximum instantaneous luminosity of 2.1 \u00d7 10 34 cm \u22122 s \u22121 . The average number of interactions occurring in the same bunch crossing, < \u00b5 >, was 13 on average in 2015 and increased during the data-taking period to 25 in 2016, 38 in 2017, and 36 in 2018. Such interactions beyond the interaction of interest, as well as interactions from neighbouring bunch crossings, are called pile-up interactions. To cope with such harsh conditions, several improvements, on both the hardware side and software side, were deployed before the start of Run 2 and during the data-taking campaign. In this paper, the performance of the ATLAS muon trigger is evaluated, primarily using samples containing muon pairs from Z boson decays. The performance of the low-p T muon triggers (p T 10 GeV) is evaluated with samples containing a pair of muons from the decay of J/\u03c8 mesons. The performance of the high-p T muon triggers (p T 100 GeV) is evaluated using events containing top quarks or W bosons, where a W boson decays into a muon and neutrino.",

            "text": "The ATLAS experiment is a multipurpose particle detector with a forward-backward cylindrically symmetric geometry and almost 4\u03c0 coverage in solid angle,2 and is composed of four major sub-detectors: an inner tracking detector (ID), a calorimetry system subdivided into an electromagnetic calorimeter and a hadronic calorimeter, and a muon spectrometer (MS). A detailed description of the ATLAS detector can be found in Ref. [1][2][3]. Muons are measured independently in the ID and in the MS. The ID consists of a silicon pixel detector, a silicon microstrip detector and a transition radiation straw tube tracker, and is embedded in a solenoid, providing a magnetic field of 2 T. The ID measures charged-particle tracks up to |\u03b7| = 2.5. Non-prompt muons are muons which originate from the decay of a secondary particle and are displaced from the primary interaction vertex. 2 ATLAS uses a right-handed coordinate system with its origin at the nominal interaction point (IP) in the centre of the detector and the z-axis along the beam pipe. The x-axis points from the IP to the centre of the LHC ring, and the y-axis points upward. Cylindrical coordinates (r, \u03c6) are used in the transverse plane, \u03c6 being the azimuthal angle around the beam pipe. The pseudorapidity is defined in terms of the polar angle \u03b8 as \u03b7 = \u2212 ln tan(\u03b8/2). Angular distance is measured in units of \u2206R \u2261 (\u2206\u03b7) 2 + (\u2206\u03c6) 2 . The MS is based on three large air-core superconducting toroidal magnet systems (two endcaps and one barrel) with eight coils each, providing a field integral between 2.0 Tm and 6.0 Tm across most of the detector acceptance. Figure 1 shows a quarter-section of the muon system in a plane containing the beam axis. In the central region, the detectors compose a barrel that is arranged in three concentric cylindrical shells around the beam axis. In the endcap region, the muon chambers form large wheels, perpendicular to the z-axis. Several detector technologies are utilised to provide both precision tracking and triggering. The deflection of the muon trajectory in the magnetic field is detected using hits in three layers of precision monitored drift tube (MDT) chambers for |\u03b7| < 2. In the region 2.0 < |\u03b7| < 2.7, two layers of MDT chambers in combination with one layer of cathode strip chambers (CSC) are used. Three layers of resistive plate chambers (RPC) in the barrel region (|\u03b7| < 1.05), and three layers of thin gap chambers (TGC) in the endcap regions (1.05 < |\u03b7| < 2.4) provide the L1 muon trigger and the read-out of the coordinate in the r-\u03c6 projection.",

Samples of prompt J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u00b5\u00b5 decays were generated using P 8.186 [7] complemented with Photos++ (v3.52) [8,9] to simulate the effects of final-state radiation.

It was interfaced to P 8.186 for the modelling of the parton shower, hadronisation, and underlying event, with parameter values set according to the AZNLO tune [14]. The CT10 parton distribution function (PDF) set [15] was used for the hard-scattering processes, whereas the CTEQ6L1 PDF set [16] was used for the parton shower.

The ATLAS trigger, including the muon trigger system, conceptually consists of two levels: the hardware-based L1 trigger and the software-based HLT. The L1 decision is formed by a Central Trigger Processor [36], based on information received from the calorimeters and muon trigger chambers. In addition, the L1 topological trigger processor [37,38], commissioned in 2016, combines information about several objects into topological information. After the L1 trigger accepts the event, it is processed by the HLT. If also accepted at the HLT level, the event is transferred to local storage and exported to a Tier-0 facility at the CERN computing centre for offline reconstruction and finally moved to permanent storage. Recorded events are gathered in data streams, depending on their primary use case and their specific offline reconstruction needs. The event selection in the HLT is referred to as a trigger, and the collection of all L1 and HLT triggers and their prescales4 is called the trigger menu. The trigger menu defines several types of triggers [39], but this paper focuses on primary triggers which are used for physics measurements and typically have no prescale applied.",

            "text": "In the L1 processing the degree of deviation from the hit pattern expected for a muon with infinite momentum is used to estimate the p T of the muon with six programmable thresholds. The number of muon candidates passing each threshold is used in the conditions for the global L1 trigger. Following an L1 accept decision, the p T thresholds and the corresponding detector regions, called regions of interest (RoIs), are sent to the HLT for further consideration [1,40]. The typical dimensions of the RoIs are 0.1 \u00d7 0.1 (0.03 \u00d7 0.03) in \u2206\u03b7 \u00d7 \u2206\u03c6 in the RPCs (TGCs) [1]. The geometric coverage of the L1 trigger is \u224899% in the endcap regions and \u224880% in the barrel region. The limited geometric coverage in the barrel region is due to gaps around \u03b7 = 0 (to provide space for services of the ID and calorimeters), the feet and rib support structures of the ATLAS detector, and two small elevator shafts in the bottom part of the MS. The barrel region is equipped with three concentric layers of RPCs. The L1 trigger decision in the barrel region is based on the coincidence of hits from three (two) concentric RPC stations [41] for the three high-p T (low-p T ) thresholds. During Run 2, only the high-p T triggers were used for single-muon signatures, while the low-p T triggers were used in coincidence with other trigger objects to select multi-object signatures, including muon pairs. During the shutdown of the LHC in 2013-2014, a fourth layer of RPC chambers was added to the trigger system in the detector feet region (\u22122.16 < \u03c6 < \u22121.77 and \u22121.37 < \u03c6 < \u22120.98) to cover holes in the geometrical acceptance caused by the ATLAS support structures. These RPC chambers were installed during the construction of ATLAS but not equipped with trigger electronics at that time. Figure 2 (left) shows the position of these chambers in the outer part of the muon spectrometer. For these new RPC chambers a two-layer coincidence is used also for the highest p T thresholds. This resulted in a 20% increase of acceptance in those \u03c6 regions. These additional 'feet RPC' chambers were commissioned during the data-taking in 2015 and enabled for physics in 2016. Figure 2 (right) shows the impact of the feet RPC chambers on the trigger efficiency in one of the two \u03c6 regions. Additionally, new RPC detectors were installed in 2014 in the elevator regions at \u03c6 1.57, |\u03b7| 0.7. Part of these chambers use small-gap RPCs with a 1 mm gas gap, rather than 2 mm as in standard ATLAS RPCs, similar to those that will be used for the High Luminosity LHC upgrade.",

Many upgrades were deployed in Run 2 in order to reduce the L1 trigger rate while keeping the efficiency high. The main source of trigger background in the L1 muon endcap system is low-momentum charged particles emerging from the endcap toroid magnets and beam shielding. To suppress these backgrounds, a coincidence requirement between the Big Wheel and TGC Forward Inner (TGC-FI) chambers was introduced in 2015. The optimisation of this coincidence and a new coincidence between the Big Wheel and TGC Endcap Inner (TGC-EI) chambers was performed in 2016. The effect of these coincidence requirements is shown in Figure 3. The asymmetry is due to the different acceptance of charged fake muons given the magnetic field configuration of the MS.",

The RoI identified by the L1 trigger enables the fast algorithms to select precisely the region of the detector in which the interesting features reside, therefore reducing the amount of data to be transferred and processed. The muon stand-alone (SA) algorithm constructs a track using the MDT hits within the RoI, refining the L1 candidate. To achieve the needed resolution in sufficiently short time, the p T of the SA muon is reconstructed with simple parameterised functions. Several changes were deployed during Run 2 in order to improve the efficiency and p T resolution of the SA algorithm. The efficiency is optimised by refining the fitting algorithm such that noise hits in the MDTs are removed. Further improvements in the p T resolution are obtained in the regions 1.05 < |\u03b7| < 1.35 and 2.0 < |\u03b7| < 2.4 by including additional hit information from the Extended Endcap (EE) and CSC chambers respectively. Figure 6 summarises the improvements in the efficiency (left) and p T resolution (right) which have been measured with the tag-and-probe method discussed in Section 8.3. The raise in efficiency at p T values below the threshold is caused by two effects: the L1 trigger mis-reconstructs a low-p T muon as a high-p T object leading to a wrong reconstruction by the fast reconstruction algorithms, and an overestimation of the muon p T if it traverses regions with a weak magnetic field, leading to an almost straight trajectory.  Figure 6: Improvements of the fast reconstruction algorithms measured in pp collision data taken in 2015 evaluated in Z \u2192 \u00b5\u00b5 events using a tag-and-probe approach outlined in Section 8.3.

If no combined muon is formed, muon candidates are searched for by extrapolating ID tracks to the muon detectors. If there are corresponding track segments, combined muons are formed. Additionally, the degree of isolation for the combined muon is quantified by summing the p T of ID tracks with p trk T > 1 GeV found near the combined muon candidate. The 'near' criterion is defined by a cut requiring \u2206z < 6 mm, with \u2206z being the distance of the track from the primary vertex in the z-direction. This cut was found to be slightly inefficient in events with high pile-up in 2017 and thus was tightened to \u2206z < 2 mm, which allowed the loosening of the isolation criterion for data-taking in 2018. The isolation criterion is defined by a cut on the ratio of the summed transverse momentum of the additional nearby tracks to the p T of the muon candidate, \u2206z<6 (2) mm p trk T /p \u00b5 T < cut. Several cut values are defined, corresponding to different WPs. Commonly, the Medium WP is used with a cut at 7%, while in 2015 a cut at 6% was applied.

The HLT_mu50 trigger is designed to collect muons with large p T without efficiency loss due to any isolation requirement. The HLT_mu60_0eta105_msonly trigger decision is based only on MS reconstruction, is active only in the barrel region, and is inactive in the endcap regions due to the high rate.

Physics analyses which benefit from muon triggers with lower p T thresholds use either dimuon triggers or muon triggers in combination with other triggers. The multi-muon triggers are made either by requiring multiple muon candidates, each of which independently fires a single-muon trigger, or by finding multiple muons using the FS strategy after the leading muon candidate has been confirmed by a single-muon trigger. The sequence of the main multi-muon trigger chains which were used unprescaled in 2015-2018 are also summarised in Table 1.

The lowest unprescaled single-muon trigger was operated at a p T threshold of 14 GeV. In the 2016 p+Pb run, only five programmable p T thresholds of the L1 trigger were used. These are the same as for pp collision data-taking, except for L1_MU11. The primary trigger chain HLT_mu15_L1MU6 was designed to select muons with p T > 15 GeV and was used in the analysis to select muons originating from Z or W boson decays. For the Pb+Pb data-taking, the lowest unprescaled single-muon trigger was HLT_mu8. The primary dimuon trigger chain in the menu was HLT_2mu4. Table 2 summarises the sequences of the muon trigger chains that ran without any prescale during the low-pile-up pp and HI data-taking.

The times for the fast reconstruction and precision algorithms are evaluated by rerunning a representative trigger configuration on a single run using an environment similar to the online HLT computing farm set-up and are shown in Figure 7. In general, the fast and precision reconstruction algorithms described in Section 5 take up about 30% of the total trigger processing time, while the fast algorithms take a very small fraction of the time. The latter did not undergo any particular CPU optimisation, but show a strong menu dependence which caused changes during the data-taking campaign. During Run 2, several improvements in the software chain were implemented to reduce the needed processing time. Notably, the CPU needs are significantly reduced in 2016 relative to 2015 by introducing a caching algorithm deployed towards the end of 2015. Furthermore, the design of the most time-consuming chains were revisited. In 2016, an additional speed-up was achieved by deploying the Eigen [45] library to perform the combined fit, which is more efficient than the previously used MA27 [46] implementation. Before data-taking in 2017 started, the call sequence of the algorithms was optimised to avoid running algorithms multiple times in a single RoI. After the changes with significant impact on the average processing time, the developments during 2017 and 2018 focused on the tail of the time distribution, addressing special event topologies requiring a long processing time. Due to several reconfigurations of the reconstruction algorithms, such as disabling precision steps not required by the trigger demands, these contributions were strongly reduced. ",

The typical maximum L1 rate is 90 kHz. Of this rate, the L1 seed of the single-isolated-muon trigger HLT_mu26_ivarmedium, which is L1_MU20, is fired at about 15 kHz for an instantaneous luminosity of 1.7 \u00d7 10 34 cm \u22122 s \u22121 . Figure 10 shows the rates of the single-muon and dimuon triggers as a function of the instantaneous luminosity. A clear linear dependence is visible, with year-to-year slope changes due to the improvements discussed above. This indicates a negligible contribution from effects not related to pp collisions. The efficiencies for single-muon L1 triggers with different p T thresholds for each year of data-taking during Run 2 are measured using the Z \u2192 \u00b5\u00b5 tag-and-probe method described above. Figures 11 and 12 summarise the efficiencies as a function of the offline muon p T for the lowest and highest threshold in the barrel and endcap regions, respectively. In the barrel region the plateau efficiency is about 75% for the low-p T trigger and 70% for the high-p T trigger, the latter being lower due to the applied 2-/3-station requirement. The steeper turn-on behaviour in the barrel region is due to the better p T resolution. In 2016, the coincidence requirements for the low-p T triggers were tightened, leading to an improved turn-on behaviour. A slightly increased plateau efficiency in 2016 was achieved by enabling the feet RPC chambers, while in 2017 the feet RPC thresholds had to be tightened for rate reduction, causing a slight decrease of the plateau efficiency. The increase in the efficiency in 2016 for the high-p T triggers is due to the inclusion of the feet RPC triggers. Operation of the RPC chambers in 2017 and 2018 suffered from gas leaks in some chambers, which could partially be mitigated but cause variations of the efficiency. The efficiencies in the endcap are higher as they do not suffer from the reduced geometrical coverage affecting the barrel triggers. For L1_MU4, the efficiency reaches 97%, while L1_MU20 reaches 90%, again caused by the different requirements applied for low-and high-p T L1 triggers. The additional coincidence requirements deployed during Run 2 to mitigate rate increases due to higher luminosities cause a small degradation of the plateau efficiency for the low-p T triggers in the endcap region. For 2017 and 2018, a clear improvement in the turn-on region is observed for high-p T L1 triggers due to the CW optimisation discussed in Section 5. 10 Muon trigger efficiency in pp data-taking",

The rate reduction relative to L1 is about two orders of magnitude, leading to a typical rate of 180 Hz for an instantaneous luminosity of 1.7 \u00d7 10 34 cm \u22122 s \u22121 , as shown in Figure 13. The efficiency of the primary single-muon triggers is evaluated using the Z \u2192 \u00b5\u00b5 tag-and-probe method. Figure 14 shows the efficiency of passing either the HLT_mu26_ivarmedium or the HLT_mu50 trigger in the barrel and endcap regions as a function of the probe muon p T . The smaller L1 efficiency in the barrel region translates directly to the HLT efficiency, while the efficiency relative to L1 is close to unity. The inefficiency observed in the turn-on region is due to the fact that no isolation criteria are applied to the offline selected muon. A rise in efficiency at p T \u223c 50 GeV is due to the fact that no isolation criterion is applied in the HLT_mu50 trigger. The trigger efficiencies in simulation and data are not in complete agreement, particularly in the barrel due to a different RPC efficiency in MC simulation, which is accounted for in analyses by the SFs. Overall, the p T dependence of the SFs is small. The difference in the ratio between data and MC efficiencies is due to a constant L1 efficiency used in the simulation. Figure 15 displays in the \u03b7-\u03c6 plane the ratio of data to MC trigger efficiencies of passing either the HLT_mu26_ivarmedium or the HLT_mu50 trigger in the barrel and endcap regions using only 2017 data. The variations between the ratios in neighbouring bins in the barrel region are due to the gas leaks in some of the RPC chambers discussed above. To ensure that the probe muon lies in the trigger efficiency plateau, it must have a p T at least 5% above the p T threshold of the trigger. The binning is chosen to reflect the detector segmentation. The statistical uncertainties are consistently at or below 5% in each bin, in both regions.   efficiency for 2018 data is observed at high average numbers of interactions per bunch crossing, which is attributed to the modification of the \u2206z selection criterion described in Section 5.",

Additionally, the identification criterion of the tag muon is tightened to the  Medium WP. A subset of the systematic uncertainties described in Section 8 are considered and found to be either negligible or limited by statistical precision and thus are neglected.

            "text": "This section presents single-muon trigger efficiency studies for Pb+Pb data at \u221a s NN = 5.02 TeV taken in 2015 and 2018. The trigger efficiency is studied using the tag-and-probe method on J/\u03c8 and Z \u2192 \u00b5\u00b5 events described above, but adapting the tag and probe muon selections to the looser trigger thresholds. A subset of the systematic uncertainties as mentioned above are considered and found to be either negligible or limited by statistical precision. The performance of the HLT_mu4 trigger is estimated using the tag-and-probe method on J/\u03c8 events described in Section 8 with minor changes. For this measurement the data taken in 2018 are analysed. HLT_mu8 is used as the tag trigger. Figure 23 (left) shows the trigger efficiencies for HLT_mu4 in the barrel and endcap regions, as a function of the probe muon p T . In the barrel region the efficiencies are about 70% in the plateau region. Trigger efficiencies in the endcap are visibly higher, with the plateau at about 90% and with a more sharply rising turn-on. No significant difference in the measured efficiencies is observed between central and peripheral collisions. The performance of the single-muon HLT_mu8 trigger is analysed using high-p T muons from Z \u2192 \u00b5\u00b5 events collected in 2015. The measurement of the HLT_mu8 trigger efficiency as a function of the probe muon p T is presented in Figure 23 (right). The trigger efficiency is measured to be around 70% in the barrel region and around 85% in the endcap region. Trigger efficiency studies of low-p T and high-p T muon triggers are performed also for HI collisions in p+Pb data taken during November-December 2016. Both the low-and high-p T trigger efficiencies are studied using the tag-and-probe method described above. The performance of the low-p T muon trigger, HLT_mu4, is analysed using J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 samples, while for the high-p T muon trigger, HLT_mu15_L1MU6, a Z \u2192 \u00b5\u00b5 sample is used. Figure 24 (left) shows the efficiency measurements for the HLT_mu4 trigger chain as a function of p T for the barrel and endcap regions. The maximum efficiency in the barrel region is \u223c80%, while in the endcaps it increases to 95%. Figure 24 (right) shows the efficiency for the high-p T muon trigger as a function of p T for the barrel and endcap regions. Overall, the maximum efficiency in the barrel region is \u223c76%, while in the endcap regions the efficiency reaches \u223c90%. ",

The fast SA muon reconstruction sometimes reconstructs two almost identical muon candidates for two closely spaced L1 RoIs, and therefore the subsequent fast combination step cannot resolve them as separate muons. In 2015, in order to avoid this potential inefficiency the fast muon reconstruction steps were omitted completely and only the precision algorithms were used. The high CPU demand of this strategy made it unsuitable for the higher instantaneous luminosities delivered by the LHC from 2016 onwards. Instead of removing the fast reconstruction step, the p T requirements for fast SA muons were set to the lowest required threshold per chain and the fast combination step was disabled. The multi-track vertex reconstruction, following the fast muon reconstruction, then makes all checks using ID tracks only. ",

            "text": "An additional PEB stream of events for low-p T muon calibration and efficiency studies was commissioned in late 2017. The events in this stream are selected by triggers requiring a first-stage SA low-p T muon and an ID track with a combined invariant mass 2.5 < m \u00b5\u00b5 < 4.3 GeV. Since a large fraction of J/\u03c8 are boosted, instead of recording the full event data, events in this stream contain only the raw detector hits in the (\u2206\u03b7 \u00d7 \u2206\u03c6) = (1.5 \u00d7 1.5) region centred on the tag muon without loss of J/\u03c8 candidates. This reduces the average event size in the stream by a factor of seven, allowing a high rate of calibration data to be recorded without requiring excessive offline storage. Table 5 shows the full integrated luminosities and the integrated luminosities collected by triggers only enabled below specified instantaneous luminosities, the so-called 'end-of-fill' strategy, in 2017 and 2018. During 2015, no end-of-fill strategy was needed due to the low peak instantaneous luminosity. During 2016, the prescale and streaming strategy changed throughout the year due to the rapidly changing data-taking conditions. Therefore, integrated luminosities for a single set of instantaneous luminosity ranges are not shown. The low-p T muon calibration stream also used an end-of-fill strategy. Figures 28 and 29 show the 2018 rates of dimuon J/\u03c8 and BLS triggers as a function of the instantaneous luminosity. The pure dimuon trigger rates are well described by a linear fit with an approximately zero intercept. For L1 triggers, there is a clear non-linearity caused by an additional dependence on the number of interactions per bunch crossing. The feature at L = 0.5 \u00d7 10 34 cm \u22122 s \u22121 is caused by LHC fills where only 600 proton bunches were colliding, but the collisions had a pile-up multiplicity of approximately 60. This non-linearity is also present in HLT triggers with additional track requirements. The effect of the end-of-fill strategy can be seen in triggers that have sharp changes in their rates.  Rate      Figure 30 shows the dimuon invariant mass spectrum for pairs of muons satisfying Tight offline quality criteria [28]. They are fitted to a common vertex, using the ID track parameters, with a \u03c7 2 < 20 for one degree of freedom. Muons are also required to have an absolute pseudorapidity less than 2.3, and have a transverse momentum greater than the trigger threshold. The dimuon triggers require two muons at L1, passing either the low-p T thresholds of 4 or 6 GeV or the high-p T threshold of 10 GeV (L1_MU11). These thresholds are subsequently confirmed at the HLT. Invariant mass requirements are applied to restrict events to the charmonium, b-hadron and bottomonium mass ranges. The yields of events collected for each trigger are cumulative, where overlapping events collected by multiple triggers are retained in the lowest-threshold histogram; hence the integral of events from all histograms is the same as the total event yield. For certain data-taking periods, trigger prescales were applied, reducing the effective yield of events collected by those triggers. The inclusive dimuon trigger, which covers the full mass range of interest and is shown as the dashed line in Figure 30, was unprescaled throughout the data-taking period. 58.45 fb Figure 30: Dimuon invariant mass for events passing a selection of BLS triggers. Triggers select specific invariant mass regions at both L1 and the HLT, and, due to vastly differing rates, some thresholds collected a smaller integrated luminosity. Smaller invariant mass regions allow lower-threshold triggers to run unprescaled at higher instantaneous luminosities, thus more signal events can be recorded than is possible with only inclusive triggers. The dashed line represents the events collected by the lowest unprescaled dimuon trigger that is inclusive of the full mass range of interest.",

Smaller effects, such as inefficiencies for closely spaced muons in the HLT, are also accounted for in this correction. To evaluate this correction, a sample of dimuon events collected with the single-muon plus track triggers as in Section 8.3 is used. The c \u2206R is measured using the fraction, \u03c1 \u2206R , of J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 events in this sample that are also selected by dimuon triggers requiring each muon to have p T > 4 GeV.

The transverse momentum threshold for the single-muon trigger was set at 26 GeV for most of the proton-proton data-taking campaign with a well-controlled trigger rate of typically 15 kHz at Level-1 and 180 Hz at the High-Level Trigger for instantaneous luminosities of 1.7 \u00d7 10 34 cm \u22122 s \u22121 . The processing times of the HLT muon trigger algorithms were continuously optimised and are sufficiently short to fit within the computing resource limitations. The efficiencies are measured with proton-proton and heavy-ion collision data over a wide p T range (a few GeV to several hundred GeV) by using muons from decays of J/\u03c8 mesons, Z and W bosons, and top-quark pairs, and show highly uniform and stable performance. The single-muon trigger efficiency is evaluated to be about 68% and 85% in the barrel and endcap region, respectively, considering a kinematic region of 25 < p T < 100 GeV. For lower-threshold multi-muon triggers, increased efficiencies of up to 75% and 87% in the barrel and encap region, respectively, are observed due to the loosened requirements at Level-1. Efficiencies are also measured in heavy-ion collision data and show comparable results. Low-momentum muon triggers are further combined with vertex and mass selections, providing the backbone of the B-physics and Light States programme. The usage of the topological Level-1 trigger selection is essential to provide well-controlled rates to cope with the conditions during Run 2. Efficiency corrections in addition to the single-leg efficiencies are derived for signatures with closely spaced muons.",
