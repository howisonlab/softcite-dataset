            "text": "Inclusive-jet cross sections have been measured in the reaction ep \u2192 e + jet + X for photon virtuality Q 2 < 1 GeV 2 and \u03b3p centre-of-mass energies in the region 142 < W \u03b3p < 293 GeV with the ZEUS detector at HERA using an integrated luminosity of 300 pb \u22121 . Jets were identified using the k T , anti-k T or SIScone jet algorithms in the laboratory frame. Single-differential cross sections are presented as functions of the jet transverse energy, E jet T , and pseudorapidity, \u03b7 jet , for jets with E jet T > 17 GeV and \u22121 < \u03b7 jet < 2.5. In addition, measurements of double-differential inclusive-jet cross sections are presented as functions of E jet T in different regions of \u03b7 jet . Next-to-leading-order QCD calculations give a good description of the measurements, except for jets with low E jet T and high \u03b7 jet . The influence of non-perturbative effects not related to hadronisation was studied. Measurements of the ratios of cross sections using different jet algorithms are also presented; the measured ratios are well described by calculations including up to O(\u03b1 2 s ) terms. Values of \u03b1 s (M Z ) were extracted from the measurements and the energy-scale dependence of the coupling was determined. The value of \u03b1 s (M Z ) extracted from the measurements based on the k T jet algorithm is \u03b1 s (M Z ) = 0.1206 +0.0023   \u22120.0022 (exp.) +0.0042 \u22120.0035 (th.); the results from the anti-k T and SIScone algorithms are compatible with this value and have a similar precision.",

            "text": "The study of jet production in ep collisions at HERA has been well established as a testing ground of perturbative QCD (pQCD). Jet cross sections provided precise determinations of the strong coupling constant, \u03b1 s , and its scale dependence. The jet observables used to test pQCD included inclusive-jet [1][2][3][4][5][6][7], dijet [1,4,[6][7][8][9] and multijet [6,7,[10][11][12] cross sections in neutral current (NC) deep inelastic ep scattering (DIS), inclusive-jet [13,14], dijet [15][16][17][18][19][20] and multijet [21,22] cross sections in photoproduction and the internal structure of jets in NC [23][24][25] and charged current [26,27] DIS. These studies also demonstrated that the k T cluster algorithm [28] in the longitudinally invariant inclusive mode [29] results in the smallest uncertainties in the reconstruction of jets in ep collisions. Jet cross sections in NC DIS [2] and photoproduction [16] were used by ZEUS [30] as input in a QCD analysis to extract the parton distribution functions (PDFs) of the proton; these data helped to constrain the gluon density at medium-to high-x values, where x is the fraction of the proton momentum carried by the gluon.",

However, it might not be best suited to reconstruct jets in hadron-hadron collisions, such as those at the LHC. In order to optimise the reconstruction of jet observables in such environments, new infrared-and collinear-safe jet algorithms were recently developed, namely the anti-k T [31], a recombination-type jet algorithm, and the \"Seedless Infrared-Safe\" cone (SIScone) [32] algorithms. Measurements of jet cross sections in NC DIS using these algorithms were recently published [33] and constituted the first measurements with these new jet algorithms.

Two types of QCD processes contribute to jet production in photoproduction; at leading order they can be separated into [34,35] the direct process, in which the photon interacts directly with a parton in the proton, and the resolved process, in which the photon acts as a source of partons, one of which interacts with a parton in the proton. Due to the presence of the resolved processes, the analysis of jet cross sections in photoproduction with different jet algorithms provides a test of their performance in a reaction closer to hadron-hadron interactions than NC DIS.",

In ad-dition, measurements of cross sections are also presented as functions of E jet T in different regions of \u03b7 jet , which have the potential to constrain further the gluon density at high x. Next-to-leading-order (NLO) QCD calculations using recent parameterisations of the proton and photon PDFs are compared to the measurements. A determination of \u03b1 s (M Z ) as well as of its energy-scale dependence are also presented.

In this procedure, no seed is used. Stable cones are then discarded if their transverse momentum is below a given threshold, p t,min . For each selected stable cone, the scalar sum of the transverse momentum of the objects associated to it,p t , is defined. Second, overlapping cones are identified and subsequently split or merged according to the following procedure. Two cones are merged if the scalar sum of the transverse momentum of the objects shared by the two cones exceeds a certain fraction f of the lowest-p t cone; otherwise, two different cones are considered and the common objects are assigned to the nearest cone.",

The transverseenergy corrections to calorimetric jets, as functions of \u03b7 jet cal and E jet T,cal and averaged over \u03c6 jet cal , were determined using the MC events. Further corrections to the jet transverse energy were applied to the data to account for differences in the jet energy scale between data and MC simulations; the method presented previously [17,56], which relies on a good understanding of the performance of the track reconstruction, was used to calibrate the absolute energy scale of the jets down to \u00b11%.

The uncertainty due to higher orders is somewhat larger for the SIScone than for the k T and anti-k T algorithms, whereas the other uncertainties are very similar for the three jet algorithms. The uncertainty coming from the terms beyond NLO is dominant in all cases. At high E jet T , the proton PDF uncertainty is of the same order (slightly smaller) as that arising from terms beyond NLO for the k T and anti-k T (SIScone) algorithms. The uncertainty arising from the photon PDFs at high \u03b7 jet becomes comparable to that coming from higher orders.

Such effects were computed as ratios of the cross section for jets of hadrons in the Pythia-MI samples over that for the samples of Pythia; these ratios are called C NP . The values of C NP depend strongly on p sec T,min , the minimum transverse momentum for the secondary scatter, since the smaller the p sec T,min value is set, the larger the phase space available for production of secondary interactions and hence the higher the jet rate. Another feature of such secondary interactions is that, due to the particular kinematics of HERA, the products of these additional interactions are expected to be boosted towards the proton direction. Several predictions including these non-perturbative effects, denoted as NLO\u2297NP, were computed by applying the factors C NP , using the p sec T,min = 1, 1.5 and 2 GeV Pythia-MI samples, to the NLO QCD calculations after hadronisation corrections.",

The comparison of these calculations to the data is shown in Fig. 4. It is observed that the NLO\u2297NP QCD calculations predict a larger jet rate at low E jet T and high \u03b7 jet , in the region where the NLO QCD prediction fails to describe the data. The NLO\u2297NP QCD prediction with p sec T,min = 1.5 GeV is closest to the data. These observations indicate the possible presence of effects such as the underlying event in the data, which are not included in the NLO QCD calculation. These non-perturbative contributions are expected to be unrelated to the hard scattering and approximately constant with the scale of the interaction, so that the ratio of this non-perturbative contribution to the jet transverse energy becomes smaller as E jet T increases, as seen in Fig. 4a. This is supported by the good description of the data by the NLO QCD calculation for E jet T > 21 GeV (Fig. 4a) and by the inclusive-jet cross section as a function of \u03b7 jet for E jet T > 21 GeV (see Fig. 5 and Table 3): the NLO QCD calculation gives a good description of the data in the whole measured range; in particular, discrepancies between data and theory are no longer observed at high values of \u03b7 jet .

In these regions, in which the gluon-induced contribution is still substantial and the possible presence of non-perturbative effects is expected to be minimised, the data have the potential to constrain the gluon density in the proton. The uncertainty coming from the photon PDFs is largest at low E jet T and high \u03b7 jet and approximately of the same order as that coming from higher-order terms.

Figure 15 also includes the ratio of the hadronisation correction factors applied to the O(\u03b1 2 s ) predictions.

The predictions for the k T and anti-k T algorithms are expected to start to differ at O(\u03b1 3 s ) and, conservatively, the uncertainties due to higher-order terms were assumed to be uncorrelated in the ratio; otherwise, a coherent variation of the renormalisation scale in the ratio would yield an unrealistic zero contribution.

Only the measurements for E jet T > 21 GeV were used in the fit to minimise the effects of a possible non-perturbative contribution in addition to that of hadronisation and the uncertainty coming from higher orders. In addition, the fit was restricted to E jet T < 71 GeV because of the relatively large uncertainty coming from the proton PDFs for higher E jet T values. The experimental uncertainties on the extracted values of \u03b1 s (M Z ) were evaluated by repeating the analysis for each systematic check presented in Section 7. The overall normalisation uncertainty from the luminosity determination was also included. The largest contribution comes from the uncertainty in the absolute jet energy scale.

(b) The relative difference between the measured d\u03c3/dE jet T and the NLO QCD calculation (dots). In both figures, the inner error bars represent the statistical uncertainties; the outer error bars show the statistical and systematic uncertainties not associated with the uncertainty in the absolute energy scale of the jets, added in quadrature; the shaded band displays the uncertainty due to the absolute energy scale of the jets and the hatched band displays the total theoretical uncertainty. In some bins, the error bars on the data points are smaller than the marker size and are therefore not visible.
