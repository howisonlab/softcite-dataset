            "text": "In the past, BESIII has taken large data samples at the J/\u03c8, \u03c8(3686) and \u03c8(3770) peaks. The corresponding beam energy was fine tuned by a J/\u03c8 or \u03c8(3686) mass scan before the data-taking. However, around 4 GeV, there is no narrow resonance in e + e \u2212 annihilation, and the \u03c8(3686) peak is too far away to be used to calibrate the beam energy. The Beam Energy Measurement System (BEMS), which was installed in 2008, is designed to measure the beam energy with a relative systematic uncertainty of 2 \u00d7 10 \u22125 [3] based on the energies of Compton back-scattered photons. The performance of the BEMS is verified through the measurement of the \u03c8(3686) mass, but 4 GeV is beyond the working range of BEMS. To precisely measure the masses of the newly observed Z c [4,5] particles, especially for those which are observed by a partial reconstruction method [6,7], a precise knowledge of the center-of-mass energy (E cms ) is crucial.",

Events must have only two good oppositely charged tracks. Each good charged track is required to be consistent with originating from the IP within 1 cm in radial direction (V xy < 1 cm) and 10 cm in z direction (|V z | < 10 cm) to the run-dependent IP, and within the polar angle region | cos \u03b8| < 0.8 (i.e. accepting only tracks in the barrel region). The energy deposition in the EMC (E) for each charged track is required to be less than 0.4 GeV to suppress background from radiative Bhabha events. A further requirement on the opening angle between the two tracks, cos \u03b8 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 > \u22120.98, is used to remove cosmic rays. The background remaining after the above selection comes from the radiative di-muon process, which has exactly the same final state and can not be completely removed. The radiative di-muon events show a smooth distribution in M (\u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ). With the above selection criteria imposed, the distribution of M (\u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) of each sample is fitted with a crystal-ball function [13] for the J/\u03c8 signal and a linear function to model the background. Figure 1 shows the fit result for the data sample 4600 as an example. In order to reduce the fluctuation of M (\u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ), adjacent data samples with small statistics are combined. Due to final state radiation, J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 \u03b3 FSR , the measured M obs (\u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) is slightly lower than the nominal J/\u03c8 mass [14]. The mass shift due to the FSR photon(s) \u2206M FSR is estimated by simulated samples of the process e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b3 ISR J/\u03c8 with 50,000 events each, generated at different energies using the generator PHOTOS [15] with FSR turned on and off. The mass shift \u2206M FSR at each E cms is obtained as the difference in M obs (\u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) between the MC samples with FSR turned on and off. These simulation studies validate that \u2206M FSR is independent of E cms . A weighted average, \u2206M FSR = (0.59 \u00b1 0.04) MeV/c 2 , is obtained by fitting the \u2206M FSR versus E cms . The measured mass corrected by \u2206M FSR , M cor (\u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ), is plotted in Fig. 2 and listed in Table I (column 4). The values of M cor (\u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) for the different data samples are consistent within errors, and the average is M cor (\u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) = 3096.79\u00b10.08 MeV/c 2 , which agrees with the nominal J/\u03c8 mass within errors. The small difference is considered as systematic uncertainty in Section VII.",

In the analysis, the \u2206M ISR/FSR is estimated with MC simulation using BABAYAGA3.5 [9]. We generate 50,000 di-muon MC events for each sample with ISR/FSR turned on and off, and take the difference in M (\u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) as the mass shift \u2206M ISR/FSR caused by ISR and FSR. In order to avoid possible bias, the same event selection criteria for the di-muon process applied for data (as described in Section V) are im- posed to the MC samples. The distributions of M (\u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) with ISR/FSR on and off are fitted with a Gaussian function in a range around the peak (same method with data in Section V). The difference in peak positions (the mass shift \u2206M ISR/FSR ) versus E cms is seen to increase with E cms , as shown in Fig. 3 ness of the fit is \u03c7 2 /n.d.f = 6.3/13. The resulting E cmsdependent \u2206M ISR/FSR will be used to correct the measured M obs (\u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) for the effects of ISR and FSR. The mass shift due to FSR only, \u2206M FSR , is estimated by comparing MC samples of di-muon production with FSR turned on and off. We find that \u2206M FSR increases with E cms and we parameterize the E cms dependence with a first-order polynomial as \u2206M FSR = (\u22121.34 \u00b1 0.84) + (0.56 \u00b1 0.21) \u00d7 10 \u22123 \u00d7 E cms , where E cms is in unit of MeV and the error matrix of the fit parameters is (0.693, \u22120.170 \u00d7 10 \u22123 , \u22120.170 \u00d7 10 \u22123 , 0.042 \u00d7 10 \u22126 ).

To achieve best precision, only events with both tracks in the barrel region (i.e., in the polar angle region | cos \u03b8| < 0.80) are accepted. A requirement on the opening angle between the two tracks of 178.60 \u2022 < \u03b8 \u00b5\u00b5 < 179.64 \u2022 is applied to suppress cosmic ray and di-muon events with high-energy radiative photons.
