The b \u2192 ccs process B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c6, which has a relatively large branching fraction, has been used to extract the B 0 s decay width difference \u2206\u0393 and CP -violating phase \u03b2 s from time-dependent angular analyses [1]. The parameter \u03b2 s is expected to be small in the Standard Model and can be sensitive to New Physics (NP). The same b \u2192 ccs process can also produce the decay B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8f 0 (980) [2], which is another promising channel for accessing the CP violation parameter, with the clear advantage that no angular analysis is required because the J P = 0 + quantum numbers of the f 0 (980) restrict the J/\u03c8 and f 0 (980) to be in a relative P -wave in contrast to a vector-vector channel such as B s \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c6 in which three partial waves are allowed.",

An iron flux-return located outside the coil is instrumented to detect K 0 L mesons and identify muons (KLM). Charged tracks are required to originate within 0.5 cm in the radial direction and within 5 cm along the beam direction with respect to the interaction point in the cylindrical geometry of the Belle detector. Electrons or charged pions are identified by combining information from the ECL or TOF, the CDC (dE/dx), and the ACC [11]. Muon candidates are identified through their track penetration depth and hit patterns in the KLM system. For both electrons and muons, the identification efficiency is nearly 100%. For a pion from B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8f 0 (980), the momentum-averaged identification efficiency is about 96% with a 22% kaon misidentification probability.",

The expected yields in the fit region from each source are: (a) B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03b7 \u2032 , 2.6 events, with \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c1 0 \u03b3 in which the photon is lost; (b) B + \u2192 J/\u03c8(K + , \u03c0 + ), 45.3 events, which enter the fit region after combining with a random pion; and (c) other J/\u03c8X sources, 240.4 events, that do not peak in \u2206E and M \u03c0\u03c0 . There are negligible correlations between \u2206E and M \u03c0\u03c0 for (b) and (c), which are parameterized by the product of a smooth \u2206E function with a threshold M \u03c0\u03c0 function for the two-dimensional probability density function (PDF). The B + \u2192 J/\u03c8K + and B + \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c0 + background shapes are treated separately. For (a), the shape and yield are obtained from a dedicated MC simulation and the measured branching fraction [14], where a MCgenerated two-dimensional PDF is used, since there are correlations between \u2206E and M \u03c0\u03c0 that are difficult to parameterize analytically. The non-J/\u03c8 background is studied with data from a J/\u03c8 mass (M ll(\u03b3) ) sideband defined as 2.5 GeV/c 2 < M ll(\u03b3) < 3.4 GeV/c 2 , with the regions \u22120.200 (\u22120.080) GeV/c 2 < M ll(\u03b3) \u2212 m J/\u03c8 < 0.048 GeV/c 2 for J/\u03c8 \u2192 e + e \u2212 (\u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) excluded. MCdetermined scale factors 0.226 (0.097) for the ratio of the non-J/\u03c8 yield in the J/\u03c8 selection window to the yield in the J/\u03c8 sideband region are used in the ee (\u00b5\u00b5) channels. We fix the non-J/\u03c8 background yield to 122.7 in the fit region. The non-J/\u03c8 background shape is obtained by fitting the J/\u03c8 sideband data with relaxed lepton identification requirements to enhance the statistics. Figure 1 shows the data together with the fitting function. The M \u03c0\u03c0 distribution in Fig. 1(a) includes a selection on the \u2206E signal region, which has a width of 60 MeV; this is much narrower than the width of the \u2206E fit region, 300 MeV. We find two peaks in the M \u03c0\u03c0 spectrum of the events in the \u2206E signal region: one for f 0 (980) and another around 1.4 GeV/c 2 . We model the signal M \u03c0\u03c0 PDF as a coherent sum of a Flatt\u00e9 function [15] for the f 0 (980) resonance and a relativistic Breit-Wigner function for a second f X resonance with mass m 0 (f X ) and width \u0393 0 (f X ):",

The signal yields, branching fractions, and significances including systematic uncertainties are listed in Table I.
