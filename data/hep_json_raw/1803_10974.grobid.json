The fiducial cross-section for inelastic interactions producing at least one prompt long-lived charged particle with momentum p > 2 GeV/c in the pseudorapidity range 2 < \u03b7 < 5 is determined to be \u03c3 acc = 62.2 \u00b1 0.2 \u00b1 2.5 mb. The first uncertainty is the intrinsic systematic uncertainty of the measurement, the second is due to the uncertainty on the integrated luminosity. The statistical uncertainty is negligible. Extrapolation to full phase space yields the total inelastic proton-proton cross-section \u03c3 inel = 75.4 \u00b1 3.0 \u00b1 4.5 mb, where the first uncertainty is experimental and the second due to the extrapolation. An updated value of the inelastic cross-section at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV is also reported.",

            "text": "The inelastic cross-section is a fundamental quantity in the phenomenology of high-energy hadronic interactions that are studied at particle accelerators. It is also important for astroparticle physics, e.g. in the description of extensive air showers induced by cosmic rays hitting the atmosphere of the Earth [1], or for the modelling of the transport of cosmic ray particles in the interstellar medium [2,3]. Since quantum chromodynamics cannot yet be solved in the nonperturbative regime, it is currently not possible to calculate the inelastic cross-section from first principles. Models based on Regge phenomenology predict, within the limits of the Froissart-Martin bound [4,5], an increase with energy according to a power law [6]. Asymptotically the Froissart-Martin bound grows proportional to (ln s) 2 , where s is the square of the centre-of-mass energy of the collision. Although originally derived for the total cross-section, this bound has been shown to apply also for the inelastic crosssection [7].",

The standard way to determine the relative luminosity in LHCb is based on continuous monitoring of the rate of interactions with at least two tracks reconstructed in the vertex detector [25]. This is done online by applying the empty-event counting method (see section 3) to a dedicated set of randomly sampled events that are partially reconstructed in the trigger. The integrated luminosity is obtained by dividing the number of those interactions by their \"reference\" cross-section. With independent data from a dedicated LHC fill at \u221a s = 13 TeV, this reference cross-section was determined to be 63.4 mb with an uncertainty of 3.9%, using the beam-gas imaging method as described in ref. [25]. For the unbiased data from leading bunch crossings the number of partially reconstructed events for the luminosity measurement is much smaller than the number of fully reconstructed events available for offline analysis. Therefore, to obtain precise relative luminosity measurements that permit sensitive studies of systematic effects, the empty-event counting method is applied to the fully reconstructed events. The analysis is performed per leading bunch crossing and in time intervals of O(1s), thereby minimising systematic uncertainties due to differences in the individual bunch currents and variations of the instantaneous interaction rates. Differences between the partial reconstruction in the trigger and the full reconstruction result in a difference of about 1% in the visible interaction rates. The ratio was measured with a statistical uncertainty of 0.2%. Accounting for this difference and taking the absolute calibration from the beam gas imaging method, a total integrated luminosity of 10.7 nb \u22121 is obtained for the full data set, with an uncertainty of 4%, which is domi-JHEP06(2018)100 nated by the 3.9% uncertainty on the reference cross-section. Additional contributions are the 0.2% statistical uncertainty of the cross-calibration factor and a 0.8% difference when requiring at least one reconstructed primary vertex instead of two vertex-detector tracks.",

The weight of each measurement is proportional to the integrated luminosity of the corresponding data set, resulting in an overall fiducial cross-section \u03c3 acc = 62.237 \u00b1 0.002 mb, where the uncertainty is purely statistical. The contributions to the systematic uncertainty are summarised in table 1. The dominant contribution is the 4% uncertainty on the integrated luminosity. The intrinsic uncertainty of the analysis is driven by a 16% uncertainty on the unfolding parameter \u03b1, which propagates into a 0.25% systematic uncertainty on \u03c3 acc . The largest contribution is due to the difference between either determining \u03b1 from all simulated events or only from events with particles inside the fiducial region. The systematic uncertainties due to the efficiency calibration and the differences in the fraction of misreconstructed tracks between data and simulation, where the full size of the correction is assigned as a systematic uncertainty, are slightly smaller. Figure 1 shows a comparison of the overall fiducial cross-section with the averages within the individual LHC fills. While within a fill all measurements are found to be consistent within their statistical uncertainties, small but significant differences are seen between fills. These differences are found to be correlated with quantities not studied in the simulation, namely the vertical position and extension of the luminous region and, to a lesser extent, the background level seen in the data.  variables corresponds to an additional systematic uncertainty of 0.05%. Also given in figure 1 are the \u03c7 2 -values of the individual averages, calculated with only the statistical uncertainties. Inspection of the \u03c7 2 -values shows that, except for the last fill, the agreement between the results within one fill is actually better than expected. This is due to the fact that the luminosity calibration and the inelastic cross-section measurement are correlated by the use of information recorded by the vertex detector. The average for the last fill, which in comparison to the others has an enlarged \u03c7 2 value, is dominated by two runs with more than 100 million events. This points to the existence of additional systematic effects of about the size of the statistical uncertainty of this average, which in view of the other uncertainties are negligible. Cross-checks from variations of the track selection criteria show no indication of additional systematic effects.",

For each set {f X } the extrapolation factor F T and the average multiplicity n ch = X f X n ch,X inside the fiducial region are calculated using v X and n ch,X from table 2. The spread of the different tunes is propagated into the extrapolation factor by drawing v X and n ch,X from Gaussian distributions with mean values and standard deviations as given in the table.
