The Belle II experiment runs at the SuperKEKB accelerator at the High Energy Accelerator Research Organization (KEK) in Tsukuba, Japan. Belle II [2] is a next-generation B-factory experiment [3]. It is the successor to the Belle experiment [4] and plans to record a dataset of 50 ab \u22121 , which is about 50 times the Belle dataset. With these data, Belle II aims to search for physics beyond the Standard Model and further study CP violation in the flavor sector, and precisely measure all parameters of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa \"unitarity triangle\" [2]. The experiment will also study properties of the strong interaction in hadron physics.",

            "text": "Operation of the SuperKEKB accelerator and the Belle II detector can be divided into three phases: Phase 1, from February to June 2016; Phase 2, from April to July 2018; and Phase 3, from March 2019 onwards. The data sample under study in this work was recorded during Phase 2. During this phase, the beams of electrons and positrons collided at the center-of-mass (CM) energy of the resonance, with a peak instantaneous luminosity of , and the data sample was collected with a nearly complete Belle II detector. (The full vertex detector was not yet installed; see the next section for the detector description.) In the earlier Phase 1, the beams were circulated but not collided in the accelerator's storage rings for beam-line conditioning, accelerator performance tuning, and beam background studies [5]. In current and future Phase 3 running, copious data samples of beam-collision events are recorded for the comprehensive physics program of Belle II. The luminosity measurement of the collision data in Phase 2 is necessary for physics measurements with this data, and is valuable preparation for future measurements in Phase 3. In collision experiments, the integrated luminosity is mainly measured according to Eq. (1) with the following two well-known quantum electrodynamics processes: Bhabha scattering (n\u03b3) and digamma production (n\u03b3) [6][7][8][9][10][11]. Here, n\u03b3 in the Bhabha process involves both the initial-state and final-state radiation photons, while n\u03b3 in the digamma process only refers to the initial-state radiation photons. These two processes have large production rates, accurate theoretic-al predictions for the cross sections, and simple event topologies that can be simulated precisely and selected with essentially no background contamination. These three features reduce the statistical and systematic uncertainties, making the Bhabha and digamma processes ideal for integrated luminosity measurements. In this work, we perform two independent measurements with these two processes; the separate measurements cross-check our methodology.",

It operates at the SuperKEKB accelerator, which is the upgraded version of the KEKB accelerator, a 3-km-circumference asymmetric-energy electronpositron collider with two storage rings: one for the electron beam, and the other for the positron beam. The two beams in SuperKEKB collide at a crossing angle of 83 mrad, larger than the crossing angle of 22 mrad in KEKB. Similar to KEKB, SuperKEKB is designed to work in the energy region from to and to operate mainly at the . The instantaneous luminosity goal of Super-KEKB is , which is about 40 times higher than that of KEKB. Notably, due to the asymmetric energies and acollinear orbits of the electron and positron beams, the coordinate system of the laboratory frame is significantly different from that of the CM frame. In particular, in the laboratory frame the z axis is along the bisector of the angle between the direction of the electron beam and the reverse direction of the positron beam, while in the CM frame the z axis is along the direction of the electron beam. Specifically, the z axis in the CM frame points at the same direction as the unit vector (0.1505, 0, 0.9886) in the laboratory frame. The Belle II detector surrounds the interaction point (IP), which is within a 1-cm radius beam pipe. It has a cylindrical structure aligned centrally to the z axis in the laboratory frame and consists of several nested sub-detectors and a superconducting solenoidal magnet. Six layers of vertex detectors (VXD), including two inner layers of silicon pixel detectors surrounded by four layers of silicon strip detectors, are designed to accurately reconstruct the decay vertices of B mesons and other shortlived particles. During Phase 2, only a small fraction of the VXD sensors were installed for diagnostic purposes, and the remainder of the VXD volume was instrumented with specialized radiation detectors for beam background measurements [12].

Since the VXD acceptance was quite limited and the CDC tracking efficiency was relatively low in Phase 2, luminosity measurements using ECL information alone are presented in this paper. To avoid the uninstrumented gaps between the ECL barrel and endcap regions where the material model in the Monte Carlo (MC) simulation was not well-defined, only information from the ECL barrel region is used in the measurements. To determine detection efficiencies, five million Bhabha events and one million digamma events were simulated at the peak energy of the resonance with a CM beam energy spread of 5 MeV [13] using the BABAYAGA@NLO [14][15][16][17] generator. The MC samples were generated in the polar angle range in the CM frame, somewhat broader than the acceptance of the ECL barrel region, to avoid spurious edge effects. Along with the generation of the samples, the theoretical cross sections of Bhabha and digamma processes ( and ) were evaluated using the same generator with the same input parameters. The cross sections were calculated to be nb and nb with a claimed precision of 0.1% [14][15][16][17].",

In the simulation, beam backgrounds, such as those arising from the Touschek effect and beam-gas interactions, were overlaid on the collision events. The beam backgrounds were first simulated with dedicated accelerator-design software [27], and then processed by GEANT4 to handle the interactions of the primary beam-background particles with the accelerator and detector material [28].
