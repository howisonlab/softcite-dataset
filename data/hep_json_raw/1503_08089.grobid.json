Various dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking scenarios which attempt to solve this naturalness problem, such as Minimal Walking Technicolor [5][6][7][8], Little Higgs [9], or composite Higgs models [10,11], predict the existence of new resonances decaying to a vector boson plus a Higgs boson.",

The bare axial-vector mass m A determines the masses of R 1 and R 2 , with the lower mass resonance R 1 having a mass close to m A . Recent lattice simulations in this model [12][13][14] predict masses close to 2 TeV. The decay channels R \u00b1 1,2 \u2192 W H and R 0 1,2 \u2192 Z H, lead to W bb and Zbb final states. A simplified approach based on a phenomenological Lagrangian [15] that incorporates Heavy Vector Triplets (HVT), which allows the interpretation of the results in a model-independent way, is also used. Here, the new heavy vector bosons, V \u00b1,0 , couple to the Higgs and SM gauge bosons via a combination of parameters g V c H and to the fermions via the combination (g 2 /g V ) c F . The parameter g V represents the strength of the new vector boson interaction, while c H and c F , which represent the couplings to the Higgs and the fermions respectively, are expected to be of order unity in most models. Two benchmark models [15] are used here. In the first model, referred to as model A, the branching fractions to fermions and gauge bosons are comparable, as in some extensions of the SM gauge group [16]. For model B, fermionic couplings are suppressed, as for example in a composite Higgs model [17].",
