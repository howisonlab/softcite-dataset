Whereas some of these are good quarkonium candidates, as predicted in different models, many states have exotic properties, which may indicate that exotic states, such as multi-quark, molecule, hybrid, or hadron-quarkonium, have been observed [2]. In such studies, the Belle experiment [3] at the KEKB asymmetric-energy e + e \u2212 collider (3.5 GeV e + and 8.0 GeV e \u2212 ) [4] played a leading role.",
