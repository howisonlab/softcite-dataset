By exploiting the initial state radiation (ISR) process, the B-factories BaBar and Belle discovered several new charmoniumlike vector states, the Y (4260), Y (4360), and Y (4660), via their decays into the hidden-charm final states \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8 or \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c8(3686) [3][4][5][6][7], while there are no corresponding structures observed in the cross sections to open-charm or inclusive hadronic final states. In contrast, the decay of the excited \u03c8 states into the above two hidden-charm final states has not been observed to date. The overpopulation of the vector states between 4.0 and 4.7 GeV/c 2 triggered many discussions about the nature of these states and the possible discovery of new kinds of hadrons [8].",

Treating \u03b7 and \u03b7 \u2032 with the Light-Cone approach and J/\u03c8 with non-relativistic QCD, and together with the contribution of the resonance decays, the authors of Ref.

The difference in the signal yields is taken as the systematic uncertainty.(c) When the fit range is changed, the region used to estimate the background will change and this introduces an uncertainty. The systematic uncertainty due to the fit range is estimated by varying the fit range from the nominal value [0.86, 1.04] GeV/c 2 to [0.87, 1.05] GeV/c 2 or [0.85, 1.03] GeV/c 2 . The largest change in the signal yields is taken as the systematic uncertainty. (d) The ISR correction factor depends on the true Born cross section of this process.Due to the insufficient information from previous experiments, we obtain the ISR correction factor according to the observed cross section measured in this analysis firstly. Then, the Born cross section is obtained and the ISR correction factors are calculated iteratively until they become stable. In the calculation, the cross section is parameterized by the sum of a BW function for \u03c8(4160) and a polynomial function. This fit introduces large uncertainty because of the limited data points and the limited precision at each energy point. To estimate the uncertainty due to the ISR correction factor, the measured cross section is also parameterized with a BW function or a polynomial function. The largest discrepancy between the results with alternative assumption and the nominal value is taken as the systematic uncertainty.",
