Exclusive \u03c1 0 -meson electroproduction is studied by the HERMES experiment, using the 27.6 GeV longitudinally polarized electron/positron beam of HERA and a transversely polarized hydrogen target, in the kinematic region 1.0 GeV 2 < Q 2 < 7.0 GeV 2 , 3.0 GeV < W < 6.3 GeV, and \u2212t < 0.4 GeV 2 . Using an unbinned maximum-likelihood method, 25 parameters are extracted. These determine the real and imaginary parts of the ratios of several helicity amplitudes describing \u03c1 0 -meson production by a virtual photon. The denominator of those ratios is the dominant amplitude, the nucleon-helicity-non-flip amplitude F 0 1 2 0 1 2 , which describes the production of a longitudinal \u03c1 0 -meson by a longitudinal virtual photon. The ratios of nucleon-helicity-non-flip amplitudes are found to be in good agreement with those from the previous HERMES analysis. The transverse target polarization allows for the first time the extraction of ratios of a number of nucleon-helicity-flip amplitudes to F 0 1",

Originally, the reaction mechanism was of primary interest, but now it has become apparent that this process also offers the possibility to study the structure of the nucleon and of the vector meson [1][2][3], especially at large virtuality Q 2 of the photon exchanged between electron and nucleon. In the onephoton-exchange approximation, all electroproduction observables can be expressed in terms of the virtual-photon spin-density matrix and the matrix elements of the electromagnetic current between quantum states of initial and final hadrons. The latter matrix elements are called helicity amplitudes F \u03bb V \u03bb N \u03bb\u03b3 \u03bb N . They describe the process",

This opens in principle the possibility to extract the helicity amplitudes, as it is detailed below. The formalism describing SDMEs of the produced vector meson was first presented in Ref. [4] for unpolarized targets only, and expressions of SDMEs in terms of helicity amplitudes were also established. The formalism was then extended to the case of polarized targets in Ref. [5]. An alternative, general formalism for the description of the process in Eq. (1) through SDMEs was presented in Ref. [6].

[3,[7][8][9][10][11] and references therein). Vector-meson-production amplitudes contain various linear combinations of GPDs for quarks of various flavors and for gluons. In particular, exclusive \u03c1 0 production on an unpolarized target is sensitive to the nucleon-helicitynon-flip GPD H, while exclusive \u03c1 0 production on a transversely polarized target is sensitive to the nucleon-helicityflip GPD E, as well. Through the Ji relation [12], the sum of both GPDs H and E is related to the parton total angular momentum. Access to GPDs relies on the factorization property of the process amplitude, i.e., the amplitude can be written as a convolution of GPDs and vectormeson distribution amplitudes, which are both non-perturbative quantities, and amplitudes of hard partonic subprocesses, which are calculable within the frameworks of perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD) and quantum electrodynamics.",

In the HERMES experiment [26], \u03c1 0 -meson production on unpolarized protons and deuterons was investigated. Both real and imaginary parts of the ratios of amplitudes without nucleon helicity flip were extracted at HERMES using a longitudinally polarized electron or positron beam. The results of the analysis of \u03c1 0 -meson and \u03c9-meson production on the unpolarized targets at HERMES using the SDME method were published in Ref. [16] and Ref. [27], respectively. The SDMEs for the electroproduction on transversely polarized protons were published in Ref. [28]. In this paper, the work of Ref. [28] is continued. Ratios of \u03c1 0 helicity amplitudes with respect to the amplitude F 0 1 2 0 1 2 are extracted from HERMES data collected with longitudinally polarized electron and positron beams scattered off transversely polarized protons. The amplitude ratios that require measurements with a transversely polarized target are reported for the first time in this paper.",

It is possible that the values of the SDMEs obtained in these two methods do not coincide, because the parameter space for SDMEs in the SDME method is different from that in the amplitude method. Indeed, the SDMEs should belong to a special region in the 71-dimensional real space to give a non-negative angular distribution. However, at present the equations determining the boundaries of this region are unknown. The physical SDMEs can be represented in terms of 17 helicity-amplitude ratios. This restricts the region in the 71-dimensional space. This requirement is not taken into account in the SDME method, but it suppresses statistical fluctuations especially when a SDME value is close to the boundary of the allowed region. Note that the positivity requirement on the angular distribution is inherent to the amplitude method, while it is not to the SDME method, where it is usually imposed artificially.",

For the \u03b3 * L \u2192 V L transition, there is a rigorous proof of factorization in hard subprocesses and GPD amplitudes [13] in the generalized Bjorken regime of large Q 2 , large W but fixed x B . Contributions to longitudinal amplitudes come from GPDs H and E, only. In contrast, the \u03b3 * T \u2192 V T amplitudes are infrared singular in collinear approximation. In order to regularize this singularity, the so-called modified perturbative approach has been used in Refs. [14,15] in which quark transverse momenta are retained in the subprocess, while the emission and reabsorption of the partons from the proton are still treated collinear to the incoming and outgoing proton momenta. The quark transverse momenta in the subprocess imply a separation of color charges, which results in gluon radiation, as it was calculated in Ref. [48] in next-to-leadinglog approximation and resummed to all orders of perturbative QCD. This gluon radiation is also taken into account in Refs. [14,15].",
