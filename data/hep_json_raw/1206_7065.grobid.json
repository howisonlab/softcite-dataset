The branching ratio, inclusive of K e4\u03b3 decays, is measured to be BR(K e4 ) = (4.257 \u00b1 0.016 exp \u00b1 0.031 ext ) \u00d7 10 \u22125 with a total relative error of 0.8%. This measurement complements the study of Sand P-wave hadronic form factors by assigning absolute values to the relative hadronic form factors obtained earlier in a simultaneous analysis of the \u03c0\u03c0 scattering lengths conducted on the same data sample. The overall form factor normalization f s = 5.705 \u00b1 0.017 exp \u00b1 0.031 ext is obtained with a total relative precision of 0.6%.",

The accumulation of a large sample of more than one million of such decays by the NA48/2 experiment has recently allowed a very detailed study of the \u03c0\u03c0 scattering lengths and hadronic form factors [2]. In that study, the I = and I = 2 S-wave scattering lengths have been determined with an improved precision comparable to the few percent relative accuracy of the most elaborate theoretical predictions [3]. Without the branching ratio value, only relative form factors could be measured, giving a full set of values up to a common normalization.",

A good control of systematic uncertainties, dominated by the external error from the normalization mode, allows rate and form factors to be measured with an improved precision.

This trigger logic ensures a very high trigger efficiency for three-track topologies.

The probability to reconstruct a common three-track vertex decreases significantly when one or more pions decay to muons. The potential effect of the different number of final state pions in signal and normalization channels is therefore minimized at the level of the common selection by requiring the presence of a good quality vertex. Stability of the result with respect to muon vetoing is also supported by varying the minimum track momentum cut from the nominal 5 GeV/c up to 10 GeV/c, where the efficiency of MUV hit reconstruction varies by more than 10% while the relative change of the final result is within 0.05%.",

If the smaller mass squared is above (0.27 GeV/c 2 ) 2 (corresponding to 2m \u03c0 + with resolution smearing), the event is assigned a factor two weight as being K 3\u03c0 -like (95.8%), otherwise it is assigned a factor one weight as being K \u03c0\u03c0 0 D -like (4.2%).
