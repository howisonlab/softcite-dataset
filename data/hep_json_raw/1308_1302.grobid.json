For a flavour-specific decay process 1 such as B 0 \u2192 D \u2212 \u03bc + \u03bd, particle-antiparticle mixing lends a sinusoidal component to the decay rates [1,2]. To measure mixing, the flavour state of the B meson must be observed to change, which requires knowledge of the state from at least two points in time. The experimentally accessible times to determine the flavour are at production and decay. Neglecting CP -violation in mixing, the decay rate N at a proper decay time t simplifies to N \u00b1 (t) = N(0) e \u2212 t 2 cosh ( t/2) \u00b1 cos ( mt) ,",

Muons that pass through the calorimeters are detected using a system of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers [10].

In order to improve the resolution on the fitted value of m s , the sample is divided into two subsamples about normalized mass n = 0.56 (with this value determined using fast-simulation \"pseudo-experiment\" studies), and the two subsamples are fitted simultaneously as described below. There are 101,000 bins over the K + K \u2212 \u03c0 + mass, the measured decay time (t ), the normalized mass (n < 0.56 and n > 0.56), and the tagging result (even and odd). Seven categories of signal and background are assigned component probability density functions (PDFs) whose fractions and shape parameters are left free in the fits to the data. The backgrounds are categorized in terms of their shapes in the mass and decay-time observables. Using the M(K + K \u2212 \u03c0 + ) distribution we separate out peaking D + (s) components from combinatorial background components. Each of these categories can be further divided into two based on their decaytime shape. We use the term \"prompt\" to describe fake candidates containing particles exclusively produced in the primary pp interaction, and the term \"detached\" for candidates that contain at least one daughter of a secondary decay and which therefore tend to exhibit a significantly larger lifetime. Candidates for the signal B-decays of interest must be both detached and peaking. The signal-like decays are usually grouped together in the fit; however, we separate the specific background contribution of B + within the D + peak and fit that directly. These components are shown in together in Fig. 4 and separately in different M(K + K \u2212 \u03c0 + ) regions in Figs. 5 and 6. Each mass PDF is a Gaussian function or a Chebychev polynomial (Fig. 4), and each background decay-time PDF is a simple exponential with an appropriate acceptance function as previously described (Fig. 6). For the signal decay-time shape we use the model described in Eq. 3, with one instance for each peak. The majority of our sensitivity arises from the mixing asymmetry, whose timedependent fit in the signal regions is shown in Fig. 7. Any odd/even asymmetry is assumed to be constant as a function of time for prompt backgrounds and for backgrounds that are known not to mix (B + , \u039b b , etc.). Generic detached backgrounds are allowed to have a time-dependent asymmetry varying as an arbitrary quadratic polynomial.",

            "text": "The full fit as described above was performed in the time domain, but measurement of the mixing frequency can also be made directly in the frequency domain as a cross-check, using well-established Fourier transform techniques [28][29][30]. The cosine term in Eq. 3 has a different sign for the odd and even samples, where the lifetime, acceptance, and other features are shared; this simplifies the analysis in the frequency domain. Any Fourier components not arising from mixing are suppressed by subtracting the odd Fourier spectrum from the even spectrum and no parameterizations of the background shapes, signal shapes, or decay-time resolution are required, allowing a model-independent measurement of the mixing frequencies. We search for the m s peak in the subtracted Fourier spectrum, shown in Fig. 8. Extensive fast simulation pseudo-experiments have shown that the value of m s is obtained reliably and with a reasonable precision using this method; however m d is heavily biased and has a large uncertainty, and so a result is not quoted. Since residual components of the Fourier spectrum are of much dark blue is used for zero and below. The vertical dashed line is drawn at 18.0 ps \u22121 . The apparent double-peak structure is an artifact of this image. On the right a slice around the D + s mass region shows only the peak as used to measure the central value and rms width lower frequency than the m s component, and several complete oscillation periods of m s are observable, the search for a spectral peak is relatively free from complications. For m d , however, the relatively low frequency is similar to that of many other features of the data, and only a single oscillation period is observed; therefore the determination of m d is difficult with this simple model-independent approach.",

To further evaluate the expected statistical fluctuation in the peak value, we perform a large set of fast simulation pseudo-experiments taking the result of the multivariate fit as a model for signal and background. The uncertainty found from the simulation studies is 0.32 ps \u22121 , slightly smaller than given by the rms. We report m s = (17.95 \u00b1 0.40(rms) \u00b1 0.11(syst)) ps \u22121 , in order to be modelindependent.

The results of the two methods were consistent, with the first method being more precise.
