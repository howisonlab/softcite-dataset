            "text": "Hadrons are the bound states of the strong interaction which is described by the quantum chromodynamics (QCD) in the framework of Yang-Mills gauge theory. One of the main goals of the hadron physics is to understand the composition of hadrons in terms of quarks and gluons. The quark model is proved successful in classifying the mesons and baryons as qq and qqq composite systems. Almost all the well established mesons can be described as a quark-antiquark state except some mesons with exotic quantum numbers which are impossible for a qq system, but no experimental evidence is reported for exotic baryons which are inconsistent with the qqq configuration until the beginning of this century. Theoretically, the QCD does not forbid the existence of the hadrons with the other configurations, such as the glueballs, the hybrids and the multiquarks. In this review, we focus on the pentaquarks. If the pentaquark really exists, it will provide a new stage to test the QCD in the nonperturbative region and to investigate the properties of the strong interaction.",

            "text": "In the quark model language, the pentaquark is a hadron state with four valence quarks and one valence antiquark as |qqqqq [1][2][3][4]. Because the pentaquark can decay to a three-quark baryon and a quark-antiquark meson, its width was suggested to be wide [5,6], but it was predicted to have a narrow width due to its particular quark structure [7,8]. In principle, any baryon may have the five-quark contents, and experiments have revealed the important role of the intrinsic sea quarks in understanding the structure of the proton. On the other hand, the pentaquark state may also mix with the corresponding three-quark state or hybrid state, so the situation is much more complicated. The pentaquark is easier to be identified if it has no admixture with any three-quark state, i.e., if the flavor of the antiquarkq in the |qqqqq state is different from any of the other four quarks [9]. Early experiments in 1960's and 1970's were performed to search for a baryon with positive strangeness as the pentaquark candidate referred to as the Z * [10], but no enhancements were found.",

Its mass and width are closed to the prediction of the chiral soliton model [8]. This particle was quickly reported in subsequent experiments by some groups, and many theoretical models were applied to understanding this particle and to predicting other pentaquarks, such as the diquark cluster model [12][13][14], the diquark-triquark model [15], the constituent quark model [16][17][18][19], the chiral quark model [20,21], the bag model [22], the meson-baryon binding [23][24][25], the QCD sum rules [26,27], the lattice QCD [28][29][30][31][32][33] and the chiral soliton model in new versions [34,35]. Unfortunately, many experiments found no signals for this particle. What is worse, the signals observed in the early experiments by some groups disappeared when including the new data with high statistics. However, some groups reconfirmed their observations for this particle with very high statistical significance in their updated experiments. So even the existence of the pentaquark is a mystery. The production mechanism and the analysis method should be investigated in details.",

The \u0398 + , if exists, is the lightest member in the predicted antidecuplet [40,41]. Its mass and width were predicted in the chiral soliton model [8,[42][43][44][45].",

            "text": "In quark model language, the \u0398 + is described as a pentaquark state |uudds . Unlike the other pentaquark |qqqqq states that the antiquark may have the same flavor with at least one quark, the lowest Fock state of the \u0398 + composes of five quarks with the anti-quark beings, which is of different flavor from the other four uudd quarks. Therefore it is easy to be identified from other ordinary baryons with minimal |qqq configurations [9]. For the pentaquark states that the antiquark has the same flavor of some quark, the mixing of the pentaquark state and the corresponding threequark state and hybrid state makes the situation complicated, because any three-quark baryon may have five-quark components from both perturbative and nonperturbative aspects, such as the baryon-meson fluctuation picture [46] and the light-cone Fock state expansion [47]. Since the \u0398 + has the same quark constituents as the combination of nK + and pK 0 , these two modes are expected as the primary decay channel, and thus are usually used in reconstructions in the experiments. After the first report for the \u0398 + , the signals were observed by many groups [11,[48][49][50][51][52][53][54][55][56][57][58], and some groups confirmed their results with new data [59][60][61][62][63]. All these results are briefly listed in Table I. Negative results were also reported by many groups, and some early positive results in the photoproduction experiment by CLAS [64] and in the protonproton collision by COSY-TOF [65] were rejected by their high-statistics experiments later [66,67]. Those are discussed in the next section.",

However, in the high statistics experiments [69,70], this resonance was reproduced neither in \u03b3p \u2192 K 0 K + n nor in \u03b3p \u2192 K 0 K 0 p. The contaminations from the \u03c6 and \u039b as well as other resonances were removed in a similar way. No peak was observed in M nK + or M pK 0 S spectrum, even though the cuts on specific angular ranges were used. The upper limits on the total cross section for the \u0398 + production in these two processes are respectively estimated to be 0.8 nb and 1.5 nb at 1540 MeV/c with 95% C.L.. The ratio for the yield of the \u0398 + to the \u039b(1520) is estimated to be less than 0.22% with 95% C.L.. This null result also contradicts with the result by the SAPHIR Collaboration [51] via the same process and in nearly the same kinematic regions.",

In the reaction \u03b3p \u2192 pK 0 S K 0 L , the K 0 S was reconstructed from two pions and the K 0 L was reconstructed from the missing mass of the pK 0 S system. The events under the \u03c6 peak M K 0 S K 0 L = 1.02 \u00b1 0.01 GeV/c 2 were selected, and only the data with the photon energy below 2.6 GeV were used. Either by restricting the M pK 0 S region like less than 1.56 GeV or by selecting the \u2212(p \u03b3 \u2212 p K 0 S ) 2 region like less than 0.45 GeV 2 , a narrow resonance at 1543 MeV/c 2 with a significance of 5.3\u03c3 was observed in K 0 S -missing mass spectrum which corresponded to the M pK 0 L . However this result was not approved by the CLAS Collaboration [95]. Apart from these experiments by the CLAS Collaboration, the FOCUS Collaboration also searched for the \u0398 + in a photoproduction experiment based on the 1996-1997 fixed-target data at FermiLab [72]. The photon beam was obtain from 300 GeV electrons and positrons and impinged on the BeO targets. A total of 72 million K 0 S events were selected. No evidence was found for the \u0398 + in the M pK 0 S spectrum from 1470 to 2200 MeV/c 2 . The upper limit at 95% C.L. on the cross section ratio \u03c3(\u0398 + )B(pK 0 S )/\u03c3(K(892) + ) is 0.13% for \u0393 \u2248 0 MeV and 0.33% for \u0393 = 15 MeV, and the upper limit on the cross section ratio \u03c3(\u0398 + )B(pK 0 S )/\u03c3(\u03a3(1385) \u00b1 ) is 2.3% for \u0393 \u2248 0 MeV and 5.7% \u0393 = 15 MeV.

The upper limit on the \u0398 + yield per hadronic Z decay is 2.5 \u00d7 10 \u22123 at 95% C.L. with the assumption that B(\u0398 + \u2192 pK 0 S ) = 25%.

About 1.3 million hadronic events were selected with the two-photon center-of-mass energy greater than 5 GeV, and about 140 000 K 0 S events were selected to search for the \u0398 + .

With the data collected at the GRAAL facility in 1998-1999, a narrow resonance in the region from 1550 to 1750 MeV/c 2 was searched for through the analysis on the beam asymmetry for the \u03b7 meson photoproduction on the free protons [104][105][106]. The photon polarization degree varied from 0.5 to 0.85 depending on the energy. The events with two photons detected in the BGO Ball were initially selected by the invariant mass of the \u03b7 reconstructed from the two photon, and the events with one photon detected in the forward wall and the other photon detected in the BGO Ball were initially selected using the missing mass calculated from the measured recoil proton. In the asymmetry distribution, a peak appeared at the forward angles and was replaced by an oscillating structure at central angles. With the narrow resonances S 11 , P 11 , P 13 and D 13 added one by one with the Breit-Wigner form, either the P 11 , P 13 or D 13 improved the description of the data. The mass and width of the resonance is M = 1688 \u00b1 2 \u00b1 5 MeV/c 2 and \u0393 \u2264 15 MeV/c 2 .",

However, the mass position of the signals in different experiments spreads in a large region from 1520 to 1560 MeV/c 2 as shown in Fig. 1. This does not consist with a narrow resonance. The mass values in LEPS early experiment [11], DIANA experiments [48,[60][61][62], SAPHIR experiment [51] and JINR experiments [55,56] are around 1540 MeV/c 2 , while the values in HERMES experiment [50], SVD early experiment [49], ITEP's analysis on the old neutrino experiments [52,53] and E522 experiment [57] are near 1530 MeV/c 2 . Besides, the LEPS recent experiment [59], the SVD updated experiment [63] and the ZEUS experiment [54] provide even lower mass values close to 1520 MeV/c 2 , and the OBELIX experiment gives a much higher value. Therefore, it is possible that even the observed signals do not correspond to the same particle.

The estimator S/ \u221a S + B which assumes a smooth background with a well defined shape and S/ \u221a S + 2B which assumes a statistical independent background with uncertainties are more proper since the production mechanism is still unknown. If so, the significance of the signals in the SVD updated analysis [63] reduces to 5.6\u03c3 and 4.1\u03c3 estimated as S/ \u221a S + 2B for the two samples respectively, but is still large enough as an evidence. In this case, however, the HERMES result decreases to 2.7-3.9\u03c3, the JINR pC 3 H 8 result decreases to 4.1\u03c3 and the JINR np result decreases to 3.5\u03c3. These are not enough to be claimed as an evidence. Besides, the log-likelihood difference is also a suitable alternative and was used by the LEPS [59] and the DIANA [62].",

As claimed by the LEPS, the contradiction between the LEPS and CLAS results is due to the different measurements. If the \u0398 + is preferably produced at the forward angles, the CLAS would possibly not detect the K \u2212 meson associated with the \u0398 + , because the most forward angle for the K \u2212 detection is about 20 \u2022 for the CLAS while most acceptance is of forward 20 \u2022 for the LEPS [59]. It may be a similar case for the contradiction between the CLAS and the SAPHIR. If this is true, it will be a suggestion on the angular distribution for the \u0398 + production. In the experiments at higher energy the \u0398 + productions will be boosted to a much more forward direction and thus escape the coverage of the detectors in most high energy experiments.
