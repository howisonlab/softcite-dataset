            "text": "The theory of neutrino oscillations explains changes in neutrino flavor, count rates, and spectra from solar, atmospheric, accelerator, and reactor neutrinos. These oscillations are characterized by three mixing angles and two mass-squared differences. The solar mixing angle, \u03b8 12 , and the atmospheric mixing angle, \u03b8 23 , have been well measured, but until recently the neutrino mixing angle \u03b8 13 was not well known. The Daya Bay experiment, located northeast of Hong Kong at the Guangdong Nuclear Power Complex in China, has made a precise measurement of electron antineutrino disappearance using six functionally-identical gadolinium-doped liquid scintillator-based detectors at three sites with distances between 364 and 1900 meters from six reactor cores. This proceeding describes the Daya Bay updated result, using 127 days of good run time collected between December 24, 2011 and May 11, 2012. For the far site, the ratio of the observed number of events to the expected number of events assuming no neutrino oscillation is 0.944 \u00b1 0.007(stat) \u00b1 0.003(syst). A fit for \u03b8 13 in the three-neutrino framework yields sin 2 2\u03b8 13 = 0.089 \u00b1 0.010(stat) \u00b1 0.005(syst).",

However, the discovery of neutrino flavor oscillation [1,2] has shown that neutrinos must have mass. Neutrinos propagate in definite mass eigenstates, denoted \u03bd 1 , \u03bd 2 , \u03bd 3 , and the mixing between the mass and flavor eigenstates is described by three mixing angles and one complex phase. Until this year, the smallest mixing angle, \u03b8 13 , was not known. Previous experiments observing reactor antineutrinos showed that sin 2 2\u03b8 13 < 0.17 at 90% confidence [3,4]. More recently, beam neutrino [5,6] and reactor antineutrino [7] experiments showed hints that sin 2 2\u03b8 13 is nonzero with significances between 1 and 2.5 \u03c3. In March 2012, the Daya Bay experiment released results showing that sin 2 2\u03b8 13 is nonzero to better than 5 \u03c3 [8], and this result was confirmed by the RENO experiment [9].",
