In a LArTPC, the interaction products exiting the neutrino vertex ionize argon atoms as they traverse the detector. As argon is a noble element, this ionization is free to drift across the medium. An electric field is imposed in the detector and the ionization tracks are drifted towards readout wire planes that are oriented with respect to one another at an angle. The ionization induces a current on the induction plane and is collected by the collection plane. Combining the information from both planes and detecting the events in time allows a three dimensional image of the event with calorimetric information to be obtained. Argon, with a relatively large density, short radiation length, and high scintillation yield, is ideal for neutrino detection and event containment. A schematic depicting the LArTPC concept for neutrino detection can be seen in Figure 1.",

The experiment features a 170 L active volume TPC with a fully contained recirculation and purification system. The main detector characteristics are summarized in Table 1. ArgoNeuT collected about 1.35E20 protons on target (POT) with the \"low energy\" NuMI configuration (0.1E20 POT in neutrino mode and 1.25E20 POT in anti-neutrino mode) from September 2009 to February 2010. Run operations were largely stable and shift-free over the >5 month span. Along with a Charged Current Quasi-Elastic (CCQE) cross section measurement (one of many potential cross section measurements) ArgoNeuT will be demonstrating the dE/dx and topological-based particle identification capabilities of LArTPCs with a special emphasis on electron/photon differentiation, a vital step toward the realization of a future backgroundfree electron-neutrino appearance search. ArgoNeuT is also developing reconstruction techniques specific to LArTPCs in collaboration with MicroBooNE [3] and LBNE [4] through the \"LArSoft\" collaboration and performing research and design for future LArTPCs. Indeed, ArgoNeuT is one of the key steps in the phased US LArTPC program moving toward construction of a >10 kiloton detector to be used for long-baseline and atmospheric neutrino oscillation physics, a proton decay search, supernova burst and diffuse neutrino detection, and more [5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13].

Long baseline electron neutrino appearance searches (MINOS [2], T2K [14], NOvA [15], LBNE [4], etc.) all employ a near and far detector in order to minimize neutrino flux uncertainties. However, due to the non-zero nearfar detector systematics (i.e. differences between the near and far detector) inherent in all long baseline experiments, cross section assumptions need to be made 1 . Knowledge of the neutrino cross section is required even in the case of a near-far configuration. The simple two particle event topology and dominant cross section in the most relevant energy region makes the CCQE interaction the golden channel for long baseline neutrino oscillation experiments. Despite being the golden channel, however, the CCQE cross section is known with only 20-30% precision over most energies. Furthermore, only one (preliminary) measurement of the CCQE cross section on argon has ever been taken (at < E \u03bd >=28 GeV) [16,17]. The neutrino energy can be reconstructed with the lepton energy and angle with respect to beam axis alone in the case of a CCQE interaction. LArTPCs have the added advantage of the ability to reconstruct the proton(s) that come out of the interaction and, with knowledge of the lepton kinematics, fully reconstruct the neutrino energy. The additional kinematic constraints from the reconstructed proton(s) aid in neutrino energy resolution and background suppression. The muon and proton(s) are identified unambiguously in a \u03bd \u00b5 CCQE event with a combination of dE/dx and range measurements in ArgoNeuT. The downstream magnetized MINOS near detector is used to sign-select and, with ArgoNeuT, fully reconstruct the muon while the proton(s) (contained >50% of the time) is reconstructed with ArgoNeuT alone.",

Surprisingly, the MiniBooNE CCQE cross section measurement (the larger of the two reported cross sections) surpasses the free neutron cross section. The discrepancy may be due to a CCQE multinucleon channel in which two correlated same-flavor nucleons are ejected [21] and the experiments' varying levels of blindness to low energy protons coming out of the vertex or \"vertex activity\". The channel may be the result of both short range correlations and 2 body currents between nucleons. Protons are not considered in the MiniBooNE CCQE measurement and protons with momentum less than \u223c300 MeV/c are not reconstructed in the NOMAD analysis. MiniBooNE's complete insensitivity to the proton(s) is advantageous in the sense that the extracted cross section measurements do not rely as much on proton FSI modeling uncertainties [18].

            "text": "Most neutrino detectors have a difficult time resolving vertex activity involving short tracks below Cherenkov threshold. ArgoNeuT, with its mm-scale resolution, three dimensional imaging, and few-10s of MeV energy threshold, will analyze the kinematics of vertex activity in CCQE interactions in an attempt to understand the multinucleon CCQE channel and final state interactions in general. Figure 3 shows a CCQE interaction in ArgoNeuT with clear evidence of vertex activity through a set of <100 MeV protons. With the help of the downstream magnetized MINOS detector, ArgoNeuT will be able to compare neutrino and anti-neutrino CCQE events in terms of vertex activity. A multinucleon channel involving a 2 proton (neutron) final state before final-state-interactions in CCQE neutrino (anti-neutrino) events will be searched for. Comparing neutrino and anti-neutrino CCQE-like events may provide some sensitivity to this channel. Event characteristics such as energy deposited in a sphere of cm-scale radius around the vertex, number of protons, and proton kinematics in general and the differences between neutrino and anti-neutrino events in terms of these variables will be studied. Furthermore, the possibility of separating neutrino and anti-neutrino CCQE events with LArTPCs using vertex activity alone will be investigated.",

The first few thousand low energy neutrino and anti-neutrino events ever detected with a LArTPC are currently being analyzed with a fully automated software capable of reconstructing the muon and finding the neutrino interaction vertex. Among other channels, ArgoNeuT is investigating the CCQE cross section with a focus on the vertex activity associated with such events. With the unique ability to sign-select muons via the downstream MINOS near detector, ArgoNeuT will perform a direct neutrino/anti-neutrino comparison of low energy protons emanating from the interaction site. This measurement may be sensitive to a multinucleon excitation channel involving two same-flavor nucleons (protons, in the case of neutrino CCQE). This study will also seek to illuminate the influence of nuclear effects on the absolute and differential CCQE cross sections and on the experimental definition of CCQE itself.",
