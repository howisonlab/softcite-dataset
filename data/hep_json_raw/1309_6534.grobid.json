The analysis uses data, corresponding to 3 fb \u00c01 of integrated luminosity, from proton-proton collisions at 7 and 8 TeV center-of-mass energies recorded by the LHCb experiment. In the limit of charge-parity (CP ) symmetry, the mixing parameters are determined to be x 02 \u00bc \u00f05:5 AE 4:9\u00de \u00c2 10 \u00c05 , y 0 \u00bc \u00f04:8 AE 1:0\u00de \u00c2 10 \u00c03 , and R D \u00bc \u00f03:568 AE 0:066\u00de \u00c2 10 \u00c03 . Allowing for CP violation, the measurement is performed separately for D 0 and \" D 0 mesons yielding A D \u00bc \u00f0\u00c00:7 AE 1:9\u00de%, for the direct CP-violating asymmetry, and 0:75 < jq=pj <1:24 at the 68.3% confidence level, for the parameter describing CP violation in mixing. This is the most precise determination of these parameters from a single experiment and shows no evidence for CP violation.",

This results in D 0 -\" D 0 oscillation. In the limit of charge-parity (CP) symmetry, the oscillation is characterized by the difference in mass \u00c1m m 2 \u00c0 m 1 and decay width \u00c1\u00c0 \u00c0 2 \u00c0 \u00c0 1 between the D mass eigenstates. These differences are usually expressed in terms of the dimensionless mixing parameters x \u00c1m=\u00c0 and y \u00c1\u00c0=2\u00c0, where \u00c0 is the average decay width of neutral D mesons. If CP symmetry is violated, the oscillation rates for mesons produced as D 0 and \" D 0 can differ, further enriching the phenomenology. Both short-and long-distance components of the amplitude contribute to the time evolution of neutral D mesons [1][2][3]. Short-distance amplitudes could include contributions from non-standard-model particles or interactions, possibly enhancing the average oscillation rate or the difference between D 0 and \" D 0 meson rates. The study of CP violation in D 0 oscillation may lead to an improved understanding of possible dynamics beyond the standard model [4][5][6][7].",

This removes about 15% of the WS background with negligible signal loss. The two-body D 0 \u00fe s mass M\u00f0D 0 \u00fe s \u00de is computed using the known D 0 and \u00fe masses [23] and their reconstructed momenta [18]. In Ref. [18], we used events selected by the hardware trigger based on hadron calorimeter transverse-energy depositions that were geometrically matched with signal final-state tracks. In the present analysis, we distinguish two trigger categories. One category consists of events that meet the above trigger requirement (triggered-on-signal, TOS). The other comprises events with candidates failing the track-calorimeter matching and events selected based on muon hardware triggers decisions (TOS). The two subsamples contribute approximately equal signal yields with similar purities. However, they require separate treatment due to their differing kinematic distributions and trigger-induced biases.",

These account for small biases due to the decay-time evolution of the approximately 3% fraction of signal candidates originating from b-hadron decays (\u00c1 B ) and of the about 0.5% component of peaking background from RS decays in which both final-state particles are misidentified (\u00c1 p ) [18].

No CP violation is expected or experimentally observed [23] in these decays. Asymmetries due to CP violation in neutral kaons and their interaction cross sections with matter are negligible. The 1% asymmetry between D \u00fe and D \u00c0 production rates [24] cancels in this ratio, provided that the kinematic distributions are consistent across samples. We weight the D \u00c0 !K \u00fe \u00c0 \u00c0 events so that their kinematic distributions match those in the D \u00fe !K 0 S \u00fe sample. Similarly, these samples are weighted as functions of K momentum to match the RS momentum spectra. The parameters associated with \u00c1 B , \u00c1 p , and r are determined separately for TOS and TOS subsets and vary independently in the fit within their Gaussian constraints 2 B , 2 p , and 2 [18]. To avoid experimenters' bias in the CP violation parameters, the measurement technique is finalized by adding arbitrary offsets to the WS-to-RS yield ratios for the D 0 and \" D 0 samples, designed to mimic the effect of different mixing parameters in the two samples. To rule out global systematic uncertainties not accounted for in Eq. 2, the data are first integrated over the whole decay-time spectrum and subsequently divided into statistically independent subsets according to criteria likely to reveal biases from specific instrumental effects. These include the number of primary vertices in the events, the K laboratory momentum, the s impact parameter 2 with respect to the primary vertex, the D 0 impact parameter 2 with respect to the primary vertex, the magnetic field orientation, and the hardware trigger category. The variations of the time-integrated charge asymmetry in WS-to-RS yield ratios are consistent with statistical fluctuations. Then, we investigate decay-time-dependent biases by dividing the timebinned sample according to the magnet polarity and the number of primary vertices per event. In the TOS sample, differences of WS-to-RS yield ratios as functions of decay time for opposite magnet polarities yield 2 values of 12, 17, and 14 (for 12 degrees of freedom), for events with one, two, and more than two primary vertices, respectively. The corresponding 2 values in the TOS sample, 9, 11, and 8, suggest a systematically better consistency. Hence, the statistical uncertainty of each of the WS-to-RS ratios in the TOS samples is increased by a factor of ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi 17=12 p , following Ref. [23]. These scaled uncertainties are used in all subsequent fits. Independent analyses of the 2011 and 2012 data yield consistent results. The ratio between RS D 0 to \" D 0 decay rates is independent of decay time with a 62% p value and a standard deviation of 0.16%, showing no evidence of correlations between particle identification or reconstruction efficiency and decay time.",
