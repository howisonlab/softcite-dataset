The data sample was collected by the BESIII detector at the BEPCII collider and corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 567 pb \u22121 . We find the first evidence for the decay \u039b + c \u2192 p\u03b7 with a statistical significance of 4.2\u03c3 and measure its branching fraction to be B(\u039b + c \u2192 p\u03b7) = (1.24 \u00b1 0.28(stat.) \u00b1 0.10(syst.)) \u00d7 10 \u22123 . No significant \u039b + c \u2192 p\u03c0 0 signal is observed. We set an upper limit on its branching fraction B(\u039b + c \u2192 p\u03c0 0 ) < 2.7 \u00d7 10 \u22124 at the 90% confidence level. Weak decays of charmed baryons provide a unique testing ground for different theoretical models and approaches, e.g. the quark model approach to non-leptonic charm decays and Heavy Quark Effective Theory [1][2][3][4][5][6][7]. The charmed baryon ground state \u039b + c was first observed in 1979 [8,9], but, compared to the rapid advances of charmed mesons, progress in the studies of the charmed baryons has been relatively slow due to a lack of experimental data and the additional difficulties of three constituent quarks in theoretical calculation. The accuracy of \u039b + c branching fractions (BFs) has long been poor for the Cabibbo-favoured (CF) decays, and even worse, with uncertainties at the 40% level, for the singly-Cabibbosuppressed (SCS) decays [10]. As a consequence, it is neither possible to test the BFs predicted by different theoretical models, nor to determine the effects of finalstate interactions (FSI). It is therefore essential to improve the accuracy of these BFs for \u039b + c decays and to search for new decay modes. The absolute BFs of twelve \u039b + c CF hadronic decay modes have been measured by the BESIII collaboration with much improved precision [11].",

These two decays proceed predominantly through internal W -emission and W -exchange diagrams, which are non-factorizable and not subject to color and helicity suppression in charmed baryon decay. Some theoretical models [3,4,12,13], predict the BFs of these two process under different assumptions (the flavor SU(3) symmetry, FSI) obtaining different results. Therefore, measurements of these BFs will help us to understand the underlying dynamics of charmed baryon decays and distinguish between the different models. Furthermore, the ratio of BFs of these two decays, which is expected to be relatively insensitive to the values of input parameters in the theoretical calculation, is an excellent probe to distinguish between the different models.",

            "text": "by assuming the same momentum-dependent data-MC differences as those for \u03c0 0 candidates. The uncertainties associated with the \u03b7 mass window for \u039b + c \u2192 p\u03b7 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 , the cos \u03b8 decay requirement for \u039b + c \u2192 p\u03b7 \u03b3\u03b3 , the \u2206E requirements, and the photon shower requirements are studied using double-tag D + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03b7(\u03c0 0 ) events. The uncertainties from the M BC fit for \u039b + c \u2192 p\u03b7 candidates are studied by alternative fits with different signal shapes, background parameters, and fit ranges, and the resultant changes on the BFs are taken as the uncertainties. In the determination of the upper limit on the BF of \u039b + c \u2192 p\u03c0 0 decay, similar alternative fits are investigated, and the one corresponding to the largest upper limit is selected conservatively. The uncertainties in the signal MC model arising from the following sources are considered: a) the beam energy spread; b) the input cross section line-shape of e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u039b + c\u039b \u2212 c production for ISR; c) the \u039b + c polar angle distribution in the e + e \u2212 rest frame; d) the different angular momentum between proton and \u03b7(\u03c0 0 ) candidates. The quadratic sum of the resultant differences in the detection efficiencies is taken as the uncertainty. The uncertainties of the MC statistics, the total \u039b + c\u039b \u2212 c number quoted from Ref. [11] and the decay BFs for the intermediate state decays quoted from the PDG [10] are also considered. The total systematic uncertainties, quadratic sum of the individual ones, are 8.3%, 10.2%, and 5.2% for \u039b + c \u2192 p\u03b7 \u03b3\u03b3 , p\u03b7 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 and p\u03c0 0 , respectively. The individual systematic uncertainties are summarized in the Table II. In summary, using 567 pb \u22121 of e + e \u2212 annihilation data taken at a c.m. energy of \u221a s = 4.6 GeV with the BE-SIII detector, we find the first evidence for the SCS decay \u039b + c \u2192 p\u03b7 with a statistical significance of 4.2\u03c3 and measure its absolute BF to be B(\u039b + c \u2192 p\u03b7) = (1.24\u00b10.28(stat.)\u00b10.10(syst.))\u00d710 \u22123 . In a search for the SCS decay \u039b + c \u2192 p\u03c0 0 , no obvious signal is observed and an upper limit at the 90% C.L. on its BF is determined to be B(\u039b + c \u2192 p\u03c0 0 ) < 2.7 \u00d7 10 \u22124 . The corresponding ratio of BFs between the two decays is also calculated to be B(\u039b + c \u2192 p\u03c0 0 )/B(\u039b + c \u2192 p\u03b7) < 0.24, where the common uncertainties are cancelled. The measured BFs and their ratio are compared to the theoretical predictions from different models, as shown in Table III. Our measured BF of \u039b + c \u2192 p\u03b7 is consistent, within two standard deviations, with one of predictions in Ref. [3], the one that assumes flavor SU(3) symmetry and negative sign for p-wave amplitude of \u039b + c \u2192 \u039e 0 K + . It is worth noting that our measurement is significantly higher than other's theoretical predictions. The measured upper limit of B(\u039b + c \u2192 p\u03c0 0 ) is compatible with the predicted values of most of theoretical models, but is smaller by a factor of 2 than that in Ref. [13]. Overall, the obtained relatively large value of B(\u039b + c \u2192 p\u03b7) and the trend toward small value of the ratio B(\u039b + c \u2192 p\u03c0 0 )/B(\u039b + c \u2192 p\u03b7) will have a significant impact on theoretical calculation and will be helpful to understand the underlying dynamics of charmed baryon decays and to test SU(3) flavor symmetry. Additional experimental data will improve the sensitivity of the measurements and allow a better discrimination between the different models.
