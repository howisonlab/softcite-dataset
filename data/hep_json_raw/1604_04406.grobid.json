Comparisons are made with predictions from the Rein-Sehgal coherent production model and the model by Alvarez-Ruso et al., the latter representing the first implementation of an instance of the new class of microscopic coherent models in a neutrino interaction Monte Carlo event generator. We observe a clear event excess above background, disagreeing with the null results reported by K2K and SciBooNE in a similar neutrino energy region. The measured flux-averaged cross sections are below those predicted by both the Rein-Sehgal and the Alvarez-Ruso et al. models. Introduction-Charged current coherent pion production in neutrino-nucleus scattering, \u03bd \u00b5 +A \u2192 \u00b5 \u2212 +\u03c0 + +A, is a process in which the neutrino scatters coherently from an entire nucleus, leaving the nucleus unchanged.",

Due to these restrictions the outgoing lepton and pion are aligned with the beam direction and no other hadrons are produced. Two classes of models have been developed to describe this process. The first class uses Adler's theorem [1] to relate the coherent scattering cross section at Q 2 = \u2212q 2 = \u2212(p \u03bd \u2212 p \u00b5 ) 2 = 0 with the pion-nucleus elastic scattering cross section.

Different models [2-5] choose different methods for extension to Q 2 > 0 and implementations of the \u03c0A elastic scattering cross-section. The validity of these models below neutrino energies of roughly 2 GeV is limited [6][7][8][9]. The second class, known as the microscopic models, was developed specifically for neutrino energies less than 2 GeV [8,[10][11][12][13]. These models are based on the single nucleon process \u03bd l N \u2192 l \u2212 N \u03c0 + , which is dominated by \u2206 production at low energies as shown in the right diagram in Fig. 1(b). The total cross section is derived from the coherent sum of the contribution of all nucleons within the individual nuclei. Effects of the nuclear medium on the \u2206 and on the pion wavefunction are taken into account. These models have not been tested against data. Only recently has one instance of this class, the model from Alvarez-Ruso et al. [11], been implemented in a neutrino event generator.",

More recent model dependent searches by K2K [19] and SciBooNE [20] at neutrino energies of 0.5 -2 GeV suffer from low statistics and reported null results. Recently the MINER\u03bdA experiment published a measurement of this cross section for neutrino energies between 1.5 GeV and 20.0 GeV [21]. This letter presents the first measurement of the charged current coherent pion production cross section below a neutrino energy of 1.5 GeV. The analysis conducts a model independent search for an excess of events at low |t|. The flux averaged charged current coherent pion production cross section is presented for two regions of the final state phase space. The restricted final state phase space region is limited to p \u00b5,\u03c0 > 0.18 GeV/c, \u03b8 \u00b5,\u03c0 < 70 \u2022 , which removes areas of low detector acceptance, and p \u03c0 < 1.6 GeV/c, which removes an area outside the range of validity of the microscopic model. The angles of the muon and pion, \u03b8 \u00b5,\u03c0 , are measured with respect to the average direction of the incoming neutrino beam.",

Interference between the resonance states and lepton mass effects are ignored, although the effect of lepton masses on phase space boundaries is taken into account. Non-resonant pion production is modelled using an extension of the Bodek-Yang model [33] to low energies. Interference between the resonant and non-resonant interaction modes is not taken into account. The relative contributions were tuned by GENIE against available single pion production cross section data [5]. The transition to non-resonant inelastic scattering is simulated using the same Bodek-Yang model. Hadronisation is described using the AGKY model [34]. Hadronic interactions in the nuclear medium are modelled using the INTRANUKE package [5]. Event selection-This analysis uses neutrino interactions which have occurred in the scintillator target of FGD1. Charged particles in the final state are analysed by the second TPC, which lies immediately downstream of FGD1. The first step is to select \u03bd \u00b5 CC inclusive events in FGD1 using the event selection criteria reported in detail in Ref. [35]. Events passing this selection are intime with the beam and contain at least one negatively charged track in TPC2 consistent with a minimally ionising particle. The interaction vertex is defined to be the most upstream point of the muon candidate track. This must lie within the fiducial volume of FGD1, which excludes the two most upstream and downstream layers, and the outer-most 5 bars in each layer. All previously published results do not use vertex activity and do not impose such a constraint on the downstream fiducial boundary.

These should be compared to the predictions of 5.3 \u00d7 10 \u221240 cm 2 / 12 C nucleus and 4.5 \u00d7 10 \u221240 cm 2 / 12 C nucleus from the models by Rein-Sehgal and Alvarez-Ruso et al., respectively. The fractional uncertainty on these estimates from each of the main sources of systematic error are shown in Table I. There is no guidance for the uncertainty of the coherent models in the T2K neutrino energy regime and so we do not include a systematic uncertainty for the signal event selection efficiency in the cross section measurement. Fig. 3 shows the background subtracted reconstructed Q 2 distribution compared to the two models. Total flux-averaged cross sections may be estimated by correcting these results by the fraction of the full phase space contained within the restricted phase space region predicted by the model. The total flux-averaged cross section is therefore inherently dependent on the signal model. The correction required for the two models is 1.20 for the Rein-Sehgal model and 1.17 for the Alvarez-Ruso et al. model, leading to the total fluxaveraged charged current coherent scattering cross section of (3.9\u00b11.0(stat) +1.5 \u22121.4 (sys))\u00d710 \u221240 cm 2 / 12 C nucleus for the Rein-Sehgal model and (3.3\u00b10.8(stat) +1.3 \u22121.2 (sys))\u00d7 10 \u221240 cm 2 / 12 C nucleus in the context of the Alvarez-Ruso et al.",

By contrast, the standard untuned NEUT predicts a total charged current coherent scattering flux-averaged cross section of 15.3\u00d710 \u221240 cm 2 / 12 C nucleus.

            "text": "Conclusion-T2K has made the first measurement of the cross section for charged current coherent production of a pion from carbon nuclei for neutrino energies less than 1.5 GeV. This has been presented both in the restricted final state phase space (p \u00b5,\u03c0 > 0.18 GeV/c, \u03b8 \u00b5,\u03c0 < 70 \u2022 and p \u03c0 < 1.6 GeV/c) and the total final state phase space. This result disagrees with the null results reported previously by the K2K [19] and SciBooNE [20] experiments. These measurements have been compared to the standard Rein-Sehgal model and, for the first time, an instance of the class of microscopic models. While T2K observes a clear excess above background the measured flux-averaged cross sections are below those predicted by both the Rein-Sehgal and the Alvarez-Ruso et al. models. The statistical precision is insufficient to distinguish between the models.
