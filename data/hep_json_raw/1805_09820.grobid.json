No evidence is found for a signal in the mass range from 5.5 to 15 GeV. Upper limits are placed on the product of the production cross-section and the branching fraction into the dimuon final state. The limits are comparable to the best existing over most of the mass region considered and are the first to be set near the \u03a5 resonances.",

However, additional spin-0 bosons, \u03c6, arise in many extensions of the SM and are often predicted to be lighter than the H boson mass, m(H) [3]. Examples of models with light (pseudo-)scalar particles are the next-to-minimal supersymmetric SM (NMSSM) [4][5][6], Little Higgs models [7][8][9] and the two-Higgs doublet model with an additional scalar [3]. Scalar fields can also provide portals to so-called dark sectors that are neutral under SM interactions and that might include dark matter particles [10][11][12]. A scalar portal mediated by a light particle can also be associated to the inflation of the early Universe [13,14].",

Most searches performed by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations rely on the hypothetical decay H \u2192 \u03c6\u03c6 and on the reconstruction of the two \u03c6 boson decays in the \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 , \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 and bb final states. A complementary strategy [15] consists of searching for the direct production of \u03c6 bosons in pp collisions via, e.g. gluon-gluon fusion. Searches of this type performed at the LHC have aimed at reconstructing a possible \u03c6 boson in its decay to either \u03b3\u03b3, \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 or \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 . A recent search in the \u03b3\u03b3 final state [16] explored a mass range down to m(\u03c6) = 70 GeV, while one employing \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 explored masses down to m(\u03c6) = 90 GeV [17].

The detector includes a high-precision tracking system consisting of a silicon-strip vertex detector surrounding the pp interaction region [28], a large-area silicon-strip detector located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4 Tm, and three stations of silicon-strip detectors and straw drift tubes [29] placed downstream of the magnet. The tracking system provides a measurement of momentum, p, of charged particles with a relative uncertainty that varies from 0.5% at low momentum to 1.0% at 200 GeV. The minimum distance of a track to a primary vertex (PV), the impact parameter (IP), is measured with a resolution of (15 + 29 GeV/p T ) \u00b5m, where p T is the component of the momentum transverse to the beam. Different types of charged hadrons are distinguished using information from two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors [30]. Photons, electrons and hadrons are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad (SPD) and",

Efficiencies for the 12 [p T , \u03b7] bins and for three different m(\u03c6) values are shown in figure 2 for the 8 TeV sample. Due to the fiducial region defined, the separation in kinematic bins and the use of the uBoost technique, the efficiencies are minimally correlated with the \u03c6 boson mass. A quadratic function is also fitted to the efficiency mass dependence and compared to the mass average. The mean value between the two efficiencies is taken as the nominal value while the difference is assigned as a systematic uncertainty. The dependence of the efficiency on the \u03c6 boson kinematics due to the [p T , \u03b7] bin size is evaluated by comparing the efficiencies in each bin obtained for pp \u2192 \u03c6 production to those obtained for a \u03c6 boson originating from the decay H \u2192 \u03c6\u03c6. The latter production mode gives a vastly different spectrum, with larger p T and a more central \u03b7 distribution, as shown in For the case where the boson is a vector, a systematic uncertainty of less than 5% is assigned to account for the dependency of the total efficiency on the boson polarisation. It is evaluated by weighting the spin-0 \u03c6 boson sample to match the angular distribution of a vector boson with either longitudinal or transverse polarisation.",

A sample of dimuon candidates with invariant mass between 5.5 and 15 GeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3.0 fb \u22121 is used. No evidence for a signal is observed and limits are placed on a benchmark model involving a new light spin-0 boson, \u03c6, decaying to a pair of muons. For the case in which the \u03c6 boson is produced directly in the pp collision, the limits obtained are comparable with the best existing. Furthermore, by exploiting the excellent LHCb dimuon mass resolution and a detailed study of the \u03a5(nS) mass tails, limits are set in a previously unexplored range of m(\u03c6) between 8.7 and 11.5 GeV. This search is designed to be largely model independent and tools are given in the supplemental material that allow for a simple reinterpretation of the result for different models. These results showcase the sensitivity of the LHCb experiment to light spin-0 bosons produced in pp collisions and its capability of closing the gaps in the invariant mass distributions by means of a superior mass resolution.",

These results can be interpreted as limits on dark photons since their production mode is expected to be dominated by Drell-Yan in this region of masses. In the second model the signal is assumed to come from the decay of the 125 GeV Higgs to two spin-0 \u03c6 bosons. Only one of the two \u03c6 bosons is required to decay to a dimuon final state, so the limit is set on (\u03c3 H /\u03c3 SM ) \u00d7 B(H \u2192 \u03c6\u03c6) \u00d7 B(\u03c6 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ), where \u03c3 H is the 125 GeV Higgs cross-section and \u03c3 SM is its value as computed in the SM. The combination of 7 and 8 TeV results is obtained by taking for \u03c3 SM the SM gluon-gluon fusion crosssections for a 125 GeV Higgs from ref. [55] and assuming that \u03c3 H /\u03c3 SM is independent on the centre-of-mass energy \u221a s.",
