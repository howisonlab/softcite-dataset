Furthermore deviations from the SM would indicate the presence of new physics beyond the SM. The datasets recorded up to the end of 2010 and corresponding to integrated luminosities of L 35 pb \u22121 per experiment have been used by ATLAS and CMS to update their measurements of inclusive jet and di-jet cross sections, as well as to measure multi-jet and angular di-jet distributions. New methods based on the sub-structure of jets to detect heavily boosted massive objects ending up in single jets at the LHC have also been tested on the dominant QCD background and compared to expectations.",

Input to the jet algorithm are 4-vectors stemming either from stable particles in generator-level simulations, partons in NLO calculations, topological calorimeter clusters [4,5] in ATLAS or particle flow (PF) objects [6,7] in CMS in full simulations and data. Topological clusters can be calibrated prior to the jet making [5] in ATLAS or left at the electromagnetic (EM) scale. The PF objects use information from all CMS subsystems and are calibrated to correspond to stable particles like \u03b3's, leptons, charged and neutral hadrons. In all cases residual jet-level corrections are needed to account for particle losses not detectable on cluster or PF object level [8,9] with larger corrections (up to a factor of 2) for EM-scale inputs and small corrections (on the level of 5 \u2212 10%) for already calibrated inputs. The jet-level calibrations are Monte Carlo (MC) based correction functions in |\u03b7| and p \u22a5 . Jet energy scale (JES) and a e-mail: menke@mppmu.mpg.de uncertainty are validated with in-situ methods using p \u22a5 balance in di-jet and \u03b3-jet events and the momentum projection fraction method in \u03b3-jet events. The Monnte Carlo based correction factors are validated with single particle test-beam data and E/p measurements of isolated hadrons in collision data which are then extrapolated using fragmentation predictions to the jet-level. The systematic JES uncertainty is typically 3 \u2212 6% for both ATLAS and CMS over a large range of pseudo-rapidities and p \u22a5 , with the larger values at large |\u03b7|, very low and very high p \u22a5 .",

The data is corrected bin-by-bin for migration effects in p \u22a5 due to the steeply falling spectrum in p \u22a5 and the finite p \u22a5 resolution. In CMS the corrected    spectra are obtained by fitting a modified power-law function with Gaussian smearing in p \u22a5 to the observed spectra. In ATLAS the correction factors are obtained from full detector simulations including detector inefficiencies. Typical corrections are in the 10 \u2212 15% range but can extend to 30 \u2212 50% at the edges of the phase space. The NLO perturbative QCD (pQCD) predictions on parton-level on the other hand are corrected for non-perturbative (NP) effects due to hadronisation and the underlying event activities. These corrections are obtained by comparing simulations with leading log generators (PYTHIA/HERWIG) which are run with and without these effects enabled. The corrections depend strongly on jet size. For R = 0.5, 0.6 the underlying event effects dominate and corrections are around 1.2 \u2212 1.4 at small p \u22a5 . For R = 0.4 hadronisation effects are dominant and corrections of about 0.8 are obtained at low p \u22a5 . The corrections approach unity at larger p \u22a5 for all used R values.    Figure 3 shows the ratio of the measured double differential di-jet cross section to that predicted in CT10-based MC simulation for two rapidity bins. The agreement with HERAPDF is best, but all tested PDF sets agree within uncertainties.",

The azimuthal de-correlation \u2206\u03c6 of the two most energetic jets as measured by ATLAS [15] is shown in the left plot of    destructive (constructive) interference has been obtained at 95% CL. A complementary study of the rapidity gap between the two jets with either leading p \u22a5 or the largest rapidity gap \u2206y has been done by ATLAS [17]. The so-called gap-fraction is defined as the fraction of events without additional jet activity in the rapidity interval between the two jets. Any additional jet within the gap has to have a transverse momentum above a veto scale p \u22a5 > Q 0 , with the default choice Q 0 = 20 GeV to stay far away from \u039b QCD . The gap-fraction is shown in the left plot of figure 5 for the choice of leading jets in p \u22a5 as a function of \u2206y for various intervals of the average transverse momentum of the two leading jetsp \u22a5 . The comparison with HEJ calculations shows some deviations in the largep \u22a5 regions but the agreement improves asp \u22a5 approaches Q 0 , which is expected since HEJ is designed to give a good description of QCD in the limit where all jets have similar p \u22a5 . The best description is achieved with POWHEG interfaced to PYTHIA although deviations are observed at large \u2206y. POWHEG interfaced to HERWIG tends to predict smaller gap fractions over the full phase space and the deviations increase for larger \u2206y as for the POWHEG+PYTHIA case.",
