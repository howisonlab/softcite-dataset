At p T > 1 GeV, the asymmetries are sensitive to the spin dependent gluon distribution \u2206g. To extract the gluon polarization \u2206g/g, information on the background asymmetry and the subprocess kinematics has been obtained from a Leading Order Monte Carlo model. Values for \u2206g/g have been calculated both as a function of the measured p T and x, using two different methods, in the region p T > 1.05 GeV.",

For Q 2 > 0.1 GeV 2 , the observed semiinclusive cross sections agree typically within 15% in variables integrated over p T . In contrast to this generally good agreement, the observed cross sections do not agree vs. p T . For p T > 0.7 GeV, the Monte Carlo underestimates the data by factors 2 to 4. The disagreement is most likely due to large NLO corrections as calculated in Ref. [8]. The LO result for \u2206g/g might therefore also be subject to large NLO corrections.",

The experimental systematic error is approximately 14% and arises from the uncertainties in the beam and target polarization measurements. It is small compared to the model uncertainty which was estimated by varying the Pythia model parameters, the unpolarized PDFs in the MC generation, the polarized PDFs in the asymmetry calculation and the assumption used for the asymmetry of the \"low-p T \" process. For Method II, the functional form was also varied. No error was assigned on the Pythia model itself, and, because this is a leading order approach, also no error was assigned to account for NLO corrections.
