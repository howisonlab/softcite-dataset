Contrary to atomic physics where the total angular momentum of an atom can be accounted for by basic quantum theory in terms of its underlying atomic constituents, a complete theoretical description of the proton spin decomposed in terms of contributions from quark and gluon angular momenta and spins is still missing. Various experimental programs have been conducted in the past to deepen our understanding on the proton spin. Deep-inelastic scattering (DIS) experiments have clearly established that the quark spin contribution is small and accounts for only \u2248 25% of the proton spin [1,2].",

The production of jets and hadrons is the prime focus of the gluon polarization studies. The production of W \u2212(+) bosons at \u221a s = 500 GeV provides an ideal tool to study the spin-flavor structure of the proton. This has been pointed out at the very early design stages of the polarized proton collider program at RHIC [4]. The first global analysis of polarized DIS data, as well as results obtained by the PHENIX [5] and STAR [6] experiments in polarized p + p collisions at RHIC placed a strong constraint on the gluon spin contribution in the gluon momentum range of 0.05 < x < 0.2, and suggested that the gluon spin contribution is not large in that range [7]. Constraining the polarized gluon arXiv:1004.4884v1 [hep-ex]  distribution function, \u2206g, through inclusive measurements has been, so far, the prime focus of the STAR physics analysis program of the Run 3/4 [8], Run 5 [6] and Run 6 [9] data samples. Inclusive measurements, such as inclusive jet production, integrate over a fairly large x region for a given jet transverse momentum region. While those measurements provide a strong constraint on the value of \u2206g integrated over a range in x, those measurements do not permit a direct sensitivity to the actual x dependence. This motivates the need for correlation measurements in polarized p + p collisions.",

W \u2212(+) bosons are produced predominantly through\u016b + d (u +d) collisions and can be detected through their leptonic decay. Quark and anti-quark helicity distribution functions are probed at large scales set by the mass of the W boson (Q \u223c m W ) where theoretical calculations are well under control. The theoretical framework is well developed to describe the production of W bosons in high-energy polarized p + p collisions including the description of the W decay leptons subject to experimental cuts, such as the transverse momentum p T and pseudo-rapidity \u03b7 of the final-state leptons [12,13]. This development profits from a rich history of hadroproduction of weak bosons at the CERN SPS and the FNAL Tevatron and provides a firm basis to use W production as a new high-energy probe in polarized p + p collisions [14]. The STAR Collaboration has provided critical measurements on the sudy of transverse spin effects in polarized p+ p collisions at RHIC.

The GRSV standard case refers to a global analysis fit of polarized DIS data [16]. The case for a vanishing gluon polarization (GRSV-ZERO) and the case of a maximally positive (GRSV-MAX) or negative (GRSV-MIN) gluon polarization have also been considered. The GS-C [17] set of \u2206g is reflected by a large positive gluon polarization at low x, a node around x \u223c 0.1 and a negative gluon polarization at large x at a scale of Q 2 \u223c 1 GeV 2 . Figure 1 shows the most recent STAR preliminary result of A LL for inclusive jet production as a function of p T based on the 2006 data sample of 4.7 pb \u22121 . Typical beam polarization values during the 2006 data-taking period were 55 \u2212 60%. The leading systematic uncertainty comes from the trigger and jet reconstruction biases. Differences between observed and true jet p T are estimated using PYTHIA and GEANT simulations and result in corrections being applied to the jet p T values. Additionally, the trigger conditions at STAR can artificially bias the analyzed data  sample towards particular flavors of partonic collisions. A conservative systematic uncertainty is evaluated to account for this effect which incorporates all allowable gluon polarization scenarios. The A LL curves in Figure 1 are derived from NLO fits to world polarized DIS data by two separate theory groups, GRSV [16] and GS [17]. The currently measured result is consistent with a small gluon polarization scenario for the STAR x-range of 0.03 < x < 0.3. This x-range accounts for \u223c 50% of the total \u2206G integral, i.e. \u2206G = 1 0 \u2206gdx, for GRSV-STD.",

            "text": "Neutral pions are identified via the two-photon decay channel, which accounts for more than 98% of \u03c0 0 decays. Two primary sub-detectors, the STAR Barrel Electromagnetic Calorimeter (BEMC) and respective Shower Maximum Detector (SMD) are employed to reconstruct decay photons from mid rapidity neutral pions. Charged pion production is of particular interest since the difference of the longitudinal double-spin asymmetries for \u03c0 + and \u03c0 \u2212 production, A LL (\u03c0 + ) -A LL (\u03c0 \u2212 ), tracks the sign of \u2206g, due to the opposite signs of the polarized distribution functions for up and down quarks. The STAR Time Projection Chamber (TPC) offers robust reconstruction and identification of charged pions up to a transverse momentum of 15 GeV/c. Particle identification is accomplished using measurements of ionization energy loss in the TPC. Figure 2 (a) shows A LL for neutral pion production at mid rapidity as a function of p T based on the 2006 data sample [18]. This new measurement is shown in comparison to NLO calculations assuming different gluon polarization scenarios [9,18]. This measurement reaches to higher p T values compared to previous measurements by PHENIX [19] and STAR [20]. At the present level of precision, the data excludes extreme gluon polarization scenarios. The STAR collaboration has recently presented also results for neutral pion production at forward rapidity based on the STAR Electromagnetic Endcap Calorimeter (EEMC) and the STAR Forward Pion Detector (FPD) [21]. These measurements provide an important milestone for future photon-jet coincidence measurements at STAR. Figure 2 (b) and (c) show STAR's new preliminary result of A LL for charged pion (\u03c0 \u2212 and \u03c0 + ) / jet correlation measurements at mid rapidity. Charged pions are reconstructed opposite a jet that triggered the experiment. The data are shown versus z \u2261 p T (\u03c0)/p T (jet) and were obtained in 2006 [22]. Full NLO calculations for this observable have recently been released [23]. These calculations will provide the basis for charged pion results to be included in a global analysis. The data shown for charged pion production are compared to a LO MC evaluation of A LL excluding extreme scenarios of \u2206g. The measurement of A LL (\u03c0 + ) is of particular interest, since its analyzing power is large because of the large ug scattering contribution to the production cross section and sizable \u2206u/u. In the future, more precise measurements of A LL (\u03c0 + ) have a great potential for providing a better understanding of \u2206g.",

            "text": "Correlation measurements such as those for di-jet production allow for a better constraint of the partonic kinematics and thus the shape of \u2206g. At LO, the di-jet invariant mass, M , is proportional to the product of the i.e. different \u03b7 3 /\u03b7 4 combinations, ranging from symmetric (x 1 = x 2 ) partonic collisions to asymmetric (x 1 < x 2 or x 1 > x 2 ) partonic collisions. This, together with the variation of the center-of-mass energy, is expected to constrain \u2206g over a wide range in x of approximately \u223c 2 \u2022 10 \u22123 < x < 0.3 for di-jet and photon-jet events. The NLO framework for correlation measurements exists and therefore those measurements can be used in a global analysis [24]. Figure 3 shows a comparison of STAR 2005 di-jet data and a PYTHIA Monte-Carlo simulation with the yield at the top and the ratio at the bottom for the invariant mass M , the pseudo-rapidity sum \u03b7 3 + \u03b7 4 and the cosine of the partonic center-of-mass scattering angle cos \u03b8 * determined from the pseudo-rapidities of both final-state jets. The normalization between data and Monte-Carlo is fixed by the invariant mass distributions. The same normalization factor is then applied to both other di-jet distributions. Data and Monte-Carlo are found to be in good agreement. Figure 4 (a) shows the statistical precision of the longitudinal double-spin asymmetry, A LL , as a function of the di-jet invariant mass, M . Those uncertainties, extracted from the 2006 data sample, are compared to a LO MC evaluation of A LL computed with a PYTHIA MC sample using different event weights to account for different polarized gluon distribution functions of GRSV [16] and DSSV [7]. The size of the statistical uncertainty at the highest invariant mass bin is at the level of the difference between GRSV-STD and DSSV.  Figure 6. Lego plot showing the BEMC E T and the TPC p T distribution for a W candidate event (a) and a di-jet candidate event (b). evaluation of A LL and a full NLO A LL calculation. Scale uncertainties are shown as a shaded band for DSSV and GRSV-STD reflecting a variation of the invariant mass M as a hard scale of 2M and 0.5M . Asymmetric cuts are imposed for the LO MC and the NLO determination of min(p T ) \u2265 7 GeV/c and max(p T ) \u2265 10 GeV/c. The result of a LO MC evaluation using GS-C [17] for \u2206g is also shown. GS-C is still consistent with the current inclusive jet results [9]. A cone radius of R = 0.7 has been used. Good agreement is found between a LO MC evaluation of A LL and a full NLO calculation. Scale uncertainties are found to be small in comparison to the variation of the chosen polarized gluon distribution functions, in particular, at large values of M .",

            "text": "The data used for the first W boson production analysis at STAR were collected in 2009 colliding polarized proton beams at 250 GeV. The STAR detector systems used in this analysis are the STAR Time Projection Chamber (TPC), the STAR Barrel Electromagnetic Calorimeter (BEMC) and STAR Electromagnetic Endcap Calorimeter (EEMC). Only their tower response has been taken into account in this analysis. The BEMC was used to measure the transverse energy, E T , of e \u00b1 . The suppression of the QCD background by several orders of magnitude was based on the TPC, BEMC and EEMC. Figure 5 shows event displays from the 2009 data taking period for a W candidate event (a), a Z 0 candidate event and a di-jet candidate event (c). A lego plot is shown in Figure 6 displaying the BEMC E T and the TPC p T distribution for a W candidate event at the top and a di-jet candidate event at the bottom. Proton-proton collision events focusing on W production at \u221a s = 500 were identified by a two-step energy requirement in the BEMC. Electrons and positrons from W production at mid rapidity are characterized by large E T peaked at \u223c M W /2 (Jacobian peak). At the hardware trigger level (L0), a high tower (HT) calorimetric trigger condition required E T > 7.3 GeV in a single BEMC tower. At the software trigger level (L2), a dedicated trigger algorithm was developed that required that a 2 \u00d7 2 tower cluster E T sum exceeds 13 GeV. The offline selection of W candidate events is based on kinematical and topological difference between leptonic W \u00b1 decays, and QCD background events as shown in Figure 5 and Figure 6. Events from W \u00b1 \u2192 e \u00b1 + \u03bd decays contain a nearly isolated e \u00b1 with a neutrino in the opposite direction in azimuth. The neutrino escapes detection, leading to a large missing energy. is sketched by the black dashed rectangular region. The TPC high-p T entry appears in the same \u03b7 \u2212 \u03c6 region as the large BEMC E T entry. Both BEMC SMD layers show a large energy deposition at the same location in the \u03b7 \u2212 \u03c6 plane as the TPC high-p T and the BEMC high-E T entry. An electron candidate is defined to be any TPC track with p T > 10 GeV/c that is associated with a primary vertex with |z| < 100 cm, where z is the distance along the beam direction. A 2 \u00d7 2 BEMC tower cluster E T sum is required to be larger than 15 GeV. The excess BEMC E T sum in a 4 \u00d7 4 tower cluster centered around the respective 2 \u00d7 2 tower cluster is required to be below 5%. In addition, the distance between the 2 \u00d7 2 cluster tower centroid and the TPC track is required to be less than 7 cm. A near-cone is formed around the electron candidate direction with a radius in \u03b7-\u03c6 space of R = 0.7. The excess BEMC and TPC E T sum is required to be less than 12% of the 2 \u00d7 2 cluster E T . The away side requirement is based on a cut on the BEMC and TPC E T sum to be less than 8 GeV. This sum is extended over the full \u03b7 range of the BEMC and EEMC and \u2206\u03c6 = 0.7 as shown in Figure 7. Figure 8 shows the evolution of all cuts for the BEMC 2 \u00d7 2 E T distribution. A clear Jacobian peak emerges characteristic for W production in contrast to QCD background dominating the low E T region.",

Taking into account the different \u03b7 ranges covered, and equivalently, the different cos \u03b8 * regions being probed, each panel represents a different range in x 1 /x 2 . At LO, cos \u03b8 * amounts to tanh \u03b7 3 \u2212\u03b7 4 The upper left panel effectively probes asymmetric partonic collisions where predominantly a low-x gluon collides with a high-x quark at large invariant masses. The effective variation of x 1 and x 2 amounts to 0.2 < x 1 < 0.6 and 0.07 < x 2 < 0.2. In contrast, a kinematic region of larger x values is probed at predominantly symmetric partonic collisions such as the one shown in the lower right panel. The effective variation of x 1 and x 2 is roughly equal and given by the horizontal axis of the lower right panel. The projected uncertainties are shown for a luminosity of 50 pb \u22121 and a beam polarization of 60%. Those projected uncertainties are compared to a LO -",
