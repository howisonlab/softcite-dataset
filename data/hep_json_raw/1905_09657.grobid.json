Notoriously, there are unknown unknowns -the ones we don't know we don't know. In this paper I want to discuss an example of a unknown knowns, that is to say things we do not single out on purpose, but in fact we know a lot about. The usual argument to ignore them is that they are small compared to other uncertainties or can not be easily factored out. In this work I will focus on one of them, the intrinsic stochastic uncertainty of the parton shower algorithm. What happens if the very same hard-scattering event is showered time and again? Shouldn't we consider the fact that, for each generated event, we observe only a single realization of the process? Such an uncertainty is likely to be covered when a very large sample of events are simulated: one can assume that among millions of events, a number of them lay very close to each other in the phase-space so that those are virtually identical. There may be some outliers for which this is a too strong assumption. Also, this procedure can be used to assign an uncertainty to a single event and may turn out to be useful to train a classifier or other deep learning systems. Finally, it can be viewed as an example of likelihood-free inference, in which the probability of an event to be showered following a certain history is conditioned by the parton-level four-momentum of the originating particle.",

One can expect that the decay products of a very high-p T particle will remain collimated in the vast majority of the times, but this picture may change dramatically as the transverse momentum of the original particle approaches the Lorentz boost threshold given by:",

The parton shower algorithm is applied 500,000 times to each event. The smearing due to QCD radiation has a mild effect for low Higgs boson p T , but presents a more pronounced and asymmetric tail as the transverse momentum increases. The effect can be quantified in terms of the width of the distribution of about 100 GeV at p T = 400 GeV, and about twice as large for p T = 800 GeV. The most dramatic effects can be seen in the mass and substructure variables distributions. It is evident that low-p T Higgs bosons are \"un-boosted\" about 60% of the times and the resulting leading large-R jet does not capture the full decay. Interestingly, the number of small-radius (R = 0.4) jets peaks at 2 for a mid-p T , but at one for a very high transverse momentum, a telltale sign of the Lorentz boost. The distribution of \u03c4 21 shows that a cut applied at \u03c4 21 < 0.5 is effective to identify two-prong decays only when the p T of the Higgs is significantly higher than the Lorentz threshold.",

The uncertainty associated to this effect is usually considered to be small when dealing with large samples of simulated events and traditionally is neglected. However, it is shown that simply due to the intrinsic stochastic nature of the parton shower process, top quarks and Higgs bosons with low transverse momentum may not be reconstructed using a single large-R jets up to 60% of the cases. On top of what is presented in the examples above, changing the parameters of the showering algorithm would also affect the distributions obtained by repeatedly applying the parton shower to the same events. Particles with a transverse momentum close to the Lorentz boost threshold are subject to large effects due to the QCD radiation and the kinematics of their decay product can appear largely different to the point that the traditional approach to identify boosted resonances can be completely ineffective. The method introduced in this paper can potentially lead to a novel approach to quantify the statistical uncertainty due to parton shower and other similar algorithms that can not be easily described by a likelihood function, with particular interest in border cases and the tuning of boosted-object taggers.",
