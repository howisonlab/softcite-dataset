            "text": "Leptons are of particulary interest in high energy hadronic collisions because they provide clean event signatures in a complex hadronic environment. Electrons and muons are often considered because of such detector signatures. In addition, \u03c4 leptons (called simply \u03c4 here after) brings a potential acceptance gain of 50 \u2212 300 % according to the lepton multiplicity of the analyzed final state. Moreover, studies with \u03c4 leptons provide an interesting area to test the consistency of the Standard Model (SM) through lepton universality at high energies by measuring the branching ratio of electroweak (EW) bosons decaying into \u03c4 leptons [1]. One promising candidate for extension to the SM is the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) which predicts new particles that can decay into \u03c4 leptons. The existence of such scenario can be probed within \u03c4 final states [2,3]. Finally, many decay chains initiated by the Higgs boson involve \u03c4 leptons and considering them can then increase the experimental sensitivity to understand the origin of electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) [4].",

            "text": "Considering \u03c4 leptons thus appears to encompass many virtues. However, understanding such an object in a hadronic environment is very challenging. The neutrino(s) from \u03c4 final states escape the detector without interacting and forces a fraction of the \u03c4 energy to be invisible. Hence, the resulting visible energy is relatively soft and includes contamination from soft QCD interac-tions, which becomes a primary component of the hadronic final state. Further, the various decay mode of \u03c4 must be considered. On the one hand, the identification of \u03c4 from its leptonic decay (BR \u223c 35%) suffers from electrons and muons originating from direct EW bosons decay as well as a poor statistic due to BR(\u03c4 \u03c4 \u2192 e\u00b5) = 6%. On the other hand, \u03c4 identification from its hadronic decays (BR \u223c 65%) have different detector signature according to the hadronic resonance involved. Moreover, direct QCD interactions from hadrons collisions produce a lot of hadronic final states which can mimic the hadronically decaying \u03c4 . To be optimal, each of the different hadronic \u03c4 final states requires dedicated analysis and a combination is performed to extract the full information.",

            "text": "The object energy calibration at collider experiments is usually performed with the help of well known physical processes. At high energies, the production and decay of Z bosons allow to perform such calibrations. Two important challenges arise for the hadronically decaying \u03c4 . Firstly, the Z \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 visible mass 1 peak is broad and shifted by 1 The visible mass observable for Z \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 events is defined by M 2 vis = (p\u03c4 1 + p\u03c4 2 + E / T ) 2 , where E / T is the transverse the neutrinos present in the \u03c4 decay which makes this observable less sensitive than for the Z \u2192 ee decay. Secondly, the various \u03c4 decay modes implie lower statistics compared with the Z \u2192 ee decay (\u223c 10 3 events versus \u223c 10 5 events). These situations require to find another strategy to calibrate the visible energy of hadronic \u03c4 lepton. If one considers a type 2 candidate having visible energy from (\u03c0 0 , \u03c0 \u00b1 ), the true energy can be obtained from the measured energy using the hadronic calorimeter response (R \u03c0 ) and the electromagnetic calorimeter response (R e ):",

Such \u03c4 objects are of particular interest to probe the Standard Model as well as physics beyond the SM including many areas such as the electroweak symmetry breaking origin or supersymmetric scenarios. In spite of the various experimental challenges, the D\u00d8 experiment has developed an effective algorithm to identify hadronically decaying \u03c4 leptons and has performed several physics measurements and searches employing such technics. In addition, some recent progress has been achieved on the \u03c4 identification improving the potential sensitivity of the experiment with \u03c4 leptons.",
