A chargedparticle tracking system immersed in a 1.4 T magnetic field consists of a silicon microstrip tracker and a drift chamber. Electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters surround the tracking system and measure particle energies. Drift chambers located outside the calorimeters detect muons. We examine data taken between August 2002 and September 2010, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 6.1 fb \u22121 . The data acquisition system is triggered by e or \u00b5 candidates [14] with transverse momentum [13], p T , greater than 18 GeV/c. Electrons and muons are reconstructed offline and selected if they have a pseudorapidity [13], \u03b7, magnitude less than 1.1, p T greater than 20 GeV/c and satisfy the standard CDF identification and isolation requirements [14]. An additional requirement is made to suppress electrons from photon conversions, by rejecting electron candidates with a nearly-collinear intersecting reconstructed track. Jets are reconstructed in the calorimeter using the jetclu [15] algorithm with a clustering radius of 0.4 in azimuth-pseudorapidity space [13] and calibrated [16]. Jets are selected if they have p T \u2265 15 GeV/c and |\u03b7| < 2.4. Missing transverse momentum [17], E T , is reconstructed using fully corrected calorimeter and muon information [14].",
