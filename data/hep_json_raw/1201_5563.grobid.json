Diffraction is studied with either diffraction enriched or suppressed data samples. Total inelastic cross-section as well as gap cross-section measurements are shown. Measured spectra of identified strange hadrons, reconstructed based on their decay topology, are also discussed. Comparisons to several QCD Monte Carlo models and tunes are exhibited. Results on two-particle angular correlations over a broad range of pseudorapidity and azimuthal angle in pp collisions are presented. Underlying event activity are studied with different hard probes: tracks, trackjets, calorimeter clusters, or in Drell-Yan events.",

Although the results presented here are mainly for soft pp collisions, it is a mandatory step to better understand the physics involved, as QCD still needs to be modeled phenomenologically. As soft QCD is a background to many rare particle searches, improving our knowledge in this low-p T region for 7 TeV will be crucial to many analyses. Moreover, it is the first time data at such high energy has been acquired, thus allowing good tuning of the Monte Carlo generators. It also allows to discriminate between the handful of theoretical models that were built over the years, by allowing them to be confronted to real measurements.",

CMS chose an event selection rejecting diffractive events, and corrected up to NSD with Monte Carlo simulation, while ATLAS applied a selection requiring tracks in the central region with defined p T and \u03b7 cuts, which is less Monte Carlo specific than the diffractive definition. With more data, CMS managed to extend its p T reach for the p T distribution to \u223c 100 GeV/c using jet triggers [7]. Multiplicity distributions, as well as the p T evolution with the multiplicity were also published [4,8], each experiment with their own event selection, and again for \u221a s = 0.9, 2.36, and 7 TeV. It was finally decided by the Minimum Bias Underlying Event Working Group[9] (MBUEWG) to have a common event selection to compare between experiments, ALICE included: events with at least one track in |\u03b7| < 0.8 with p T > 0.5 GeV, which led to CMS publishing new results [10].

Neither the p T distribution nor its evolution with multiplicity is well predicted by the Monte Carlo generators: pre-LHC tunes tend to predict too many high p T particles, particularly at high multiplicity, as seen in Fig.1 (Top Right), except for phojet.

Their rapidity, p T and multiplicity distributions have been measured with different event selection, and while presenting good agreement with other experiments, Monte Carlo tunes have difficulties to reproduce them, predicting too few strange particles and harder p T spectra, the differences with data increasing with the mass of the strange particle. Ratios of rapidity density between \u039b and K 0 s , and \u039e \u2212 and \u039b for both 0.9 TeV and 7 TeV seems to indicate an energy-independent production of strange particles, which is in contradiction with Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) production expectancies. \u039b/\u039b ratios are consistent with unity in data, indicating that no significant transport of baryon number to mid-rapidities  is present, in accordance with standard model predictions and measurements from other experiments. One of the first unexpected result from the LHC era appeared in the two-particle correlation study. Using pair of particles from the same event as signal and from different events as background, ATLAS[18] and CMS [19] constructed a two-particle correlation function, and measured its value for different \u2206\u03b7 and \u2206\u03c6 angular separation of the two particles, as illustrated in Fig.3(Left). It showed the expected jet structure for \u2206\u03b7 = \u2206\u03c6 = 0, as well as the away structure for \u2206\u03c6 = \u03c0. and high multiplicity (1 < p T < 3 GeV and N ch > 110), a clear ridge-like structure emerges at \u2206\u03c6 = 0 and \u2206\u03b7 > \u03c0/2, as shown in Fig.3(Right) by CMS (ATLAS did not have enough statistics in this narrow phase-space), which is absolutely not reproduced by any Monte Carlo generators simulating pp collisions. Although this feature is well known in heavy ion collisions, it was the first time it was observed in pp collisions.

            "text": "The Underlying Event (UE) is usually defined, in presence of a hard probe in the event, as everything but this probe. Depending on the subdetector used, different hard probes can be considered to get the scale of the event: ATLAS used the highest p T track [20] or calorimeter cluster [21], while CMS preferred looking at trackjets [22] or muon pairs in Drell-Yan events [23]. Each of those choices have different scales, and thus can not be directly compared: since trackjets are clusters of tracks, they reach higher p T values than single tracks; calorimeter clusters also take into account neutral particles undetected in the tracker; Drell-Yan events have very clean signals and use the muon systems to get the event scale. Three topological regions of 120 \u2022 are then defined with respect to the hard probe: the towards region (0 \u2022 < |\u2206\u03c6| < 60 \u2022 ) where the hard part of the event is, the away region (120 \u2022 < |\u2206\u03c6| < 180 \u2022 ) balancing the towards p T , and the transverse region (60 \u2022 < |\u2206\u03c6| < 120 \u2022 ) where the Underlying Event lies, \u2206\u03c6 being the difference in azimuthal angle \u03c6 between the hard probe and the track/cluster. For Drell-Yan events, both transverse and towards regions are sensitive to UE.",

            "text": "The Monte Carlo generators seem to underestimate the particle density, especially in the transverse region. When looking, in the transverse region, at the evolution with respect to the leading p T probe of the mean multiplicity and mean p T sum, the fast rise at low p T scale is attributed to multiple partonic interaction (MPI), before reaching a plateau, as Fig.4 (Top) illustrates in case of a calorimeter cluster probe. Moreover, once again no generator tune describes properly neither the rise nor the plateau. For Drell-Yan events, shown in Fig.4 (Bottom), the increase with the p T of the muon pair comes from ISR increase, while N ch and p T densities being independent of the muon pair  mass is explained by the already saturated MPI in the selected event scale.",

            "text": "ATLAS and CMS have proven their general purposefulness with many publications of soft QCD physic results. With several event selections, minimum bias distributions of \u03b7, p T , N ch and p T VS N ch at \u221a s = 0.9, 2.36, and 7 TeV were compared with other experiments when possible, as well as a multitude of Monte Carlo generator tunes, none of which are able to describe the softer p T and huge rise of particle production with energy. This led to a communitywide effort to improve and tune the available Monte Carlo generators. Extrapolated inelastic cross-section were measured and compatible, though overestimated by Monte Carlo models. Diffraction was also studied, with minimum bias observables for either diffraction enriched or suppressed data samples, as well as the rapidity gap cross-section. Due to excellent tracker performances, strange particle production was examined, Monte Carlo discrepancies with data increasing with the particle mass. An unexpected ridgelike structure was found during the two-particle correlation analysis for mid-p T and high multiplicity particles, and albeit attracting many attention from theory, its origin is still being discussed. Finally, underlying events have been studied with different hard probes, and despite Monte Carlo generators being tuned with those results, none are able to describe perfectly the data.",
