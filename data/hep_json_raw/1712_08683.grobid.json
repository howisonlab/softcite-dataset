            "text": "The CP -violating weak phases \u03c6 s arise in the interference between the amplitudes of B s mesons directly decaying to CP eigenstates and those decaying to the same final state after B 0 s -B 0 s oscillation. The B 0 s \u2192 K * 0 K * 0 decay, 1 which in the Standard Model (SM) is JHEP03(2018)140 dominated by the gluonic loop diagram shown in figure 1, has been discussed extensively in the literature as a benchmark test for the SM and as an excellent probe for physics beyond the SM [1][2][3][4][5][6][7]. New heavy particles entering the loop would introduce additional amplitudes and modify properties of the decay from their SM values. In general, the weak phase \u03c6 s depends on the B 0 s decay channel under consideration, and can be different between channels as it depends on the contributions from tree-and loop-level processes. The notation \u03c6 dd s is used when referring to the weak phase measured in b \u2192 dds transitions. For b \u2192 ccs transitions, e.g. B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8 K + K \u2212 and B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decays, the weak phase \u03c6 cc s has been measured by several experiments [8][9][10][11]. The world average reported by HFLAV, \u03c6 cc s = \u22120.021 \u00b1 0.031 rad [8], is dominated by the LHCb measurement \u03c6 cc s = \u22120.010 \u00b1 0.039 rad [9]. The LHCb collaboration has also measured the \u03c6 ss s phase in B 0 s \u2192 \u03c6\u03c6 transitions [12], reporting a value of \u03c6 ss s = \u22120.17 \u00b1 0.15 rad. The decay B 0 s \u2192 K * 0 K * 0 , with K * 0 \u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212 and K * 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + , was first observed by the LHCb collaboration, based on pp collision data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35 pb \u22121 at a centre-of-mass energy \u221a s = 7 TeV [13]. A branching fraction and a final-state polarisation analysis were reported. An updated analysis of the B 0 s \u2192 (K + \u03c0 \u2212 )(K \u2212 \u03c0 + ) decay was performed by LHCb using 1.0 fb \u22121 of data at \u221a s = 7 TeV [14]. In both analyses, the invariant mass of the two K\u03c0 pairs 2 was restricted to a window of \u00b1150 MeV/c 2 around the known K * 0 mass. This publication reports the first decay-time-dependent amplitude analysis of B 0 s \u2192 (K + \u03c0 \u2212 )(K \u2212 \u03c0 + ) decays using a K\u03c0 mass window that extends from 750 to 1600 MeV/c 2 , approximately corresponding to the region between the K\u03c0 production threshold and the D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + resonance. At the current level of sensitivity, the assumption of common CP -violating parameters for the contributing amplitudes is appropriate. Consequently, such a wide window provides a four-fold increase of the signal sample size with respect to the narrow window of 150 MeV/c 2 around the K * 0 mass. The analysis uses pp collision data collected by LHCb in 2011 and 2012 at \u221a s = 7 and 8 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3.0 fb \u22121 . In this study, nine different quasi-two-body decay  Table 1. Quasi-two-body decay channels and corresponding polarisation amplitudes contributing to the B 0 s \u2192 (K + \u03c0 \u2212 )(K \u2212 \u03c0 + ) final state in the K\u03c0 mass window from 750 to 1600 MeV/c 2 . The different contributions are identified by the spin j 1 (j 2 ) of the K + \u03c0 \u2212 (K \u2212 \u03c0 + ) pair and the helicity h. In cases where more than one amplitude contributes, the polarisations are defined as being longitudinal, parallel, or perpendicular, which are then denoted by 0, and \u22a5 respectively, following the definitions given in ref. [15]. The subscripts 1 and 2 in the parallel and perpendicular helicities of the tensor-tensor component denote different spin states leading to a parallel or a perpendicular configuration, as discussed in appendix A. channels are considered, corresponding to the different possible combinations of K\u03c0 pairs with spin 0, 1 or 2. Additional contributions were studied and found to be negligible in the phase-space region considered in this analysis. The K\u03c0 spectrum is dominated by the K * 0 (800) 0 , K * 0 (1430) 0 , K * (892) 0 and K * 2 (1430) 0 resonances. Angular momentum conservation in the decay allows for one single amplitude in modes involving at least one scalar K\u03c0 pair, three amplitudes for vector-vector or vector-tensor decays and five amplitudes for a tensor-tensor decay. These possibilities are listed in table 1. There is a physical difference between decay pairs of the form scalar-vector and vector-scalar. Namely, in the used convention, the spectator quark from the B 0 s decay (see figure 1) always ends up in the second K\u03c0 pair. The CP -averaged fractions of the contributing amplitudes, f i , as well as their strong-phase differences, \u03b4 i , are determined together with the CP -violating weak phase \u03c6 dd s and a parameter that accounts for the amount of CP violation in decay, |\u03bb|. This is the first time that the weak phase in b \u2192 dds transitions has been measured. It is also the first time that the tensor components in the (K + \u03c0 \u2212 )(K \u2212 \u03c0 + ) system have been studied.",

The quantum numbers used to label the (K + \u03c0 \u2212 )(K \u2212 \u03c0 + ) final states are the spin j 1 (j 2 ) of the K + \u03c0 \u2212 (K \u2212 \u03c0 + ) pair and the helicity h. The vector component is represented in this analysis by the K * 0 meson, since this resonance is found to be largely dominant in this spin configuration. Potential contributions from the K * 1 (1410) 0 and K * 1 (1680) 0 resonances are considered as sources of systematic uncertainty. For the tensor case, only the K * 2 (1430) 0 resonance contributes in the considered K\u03c0 mass window. The scalar component, denoted in this paper by (K\u03c0) * 0 requires a more careful treatment. It can have contributions from the K * 0 (800) 0 and K * 0 (1430) 0 resonances and from a nonresonant K\u03c0 component. The parameterisation of the K\u03c0 invariant mass spectrum for the scalar contribution is explained later in this section.

Relativistic Breit-Wigner functions of spin 1 and 2, parameterising the K * 0 and the K * 2 (1430) 0 resonances, are used for M 1 and M 2 , respectively. The parameterisation of M 0 is based on the phenomenological S-wave scattering amplitude of isospin 1/2 presented in ref. [17]. Since only the phase evolution of M 0 is linked to that of the scattering amplitude (by virtue of Watson's theorem [18]), its modulus is parameterised with a fourth-order polynomial whose coefficients are determined in the final fit to data. Details of this parameterisation can be found in appendix B. The normalisation condition for the mass-dependent terms is",

The tracking system provides a measurement of momentum, p, of charged particles with relative uncertainty that varies from 0.5% at low momentum to 1.0% at 200 GeV/c. The minimum distance of a track to a primary vertex (PV), the impact parameter (IP), is measured with resolution of (15 + 29/p T ) \u00b5m, where p T is the component of the momentum transverse to the beam, in GeV/c. Different types of charged hadrons are distinguished using information from two ring-imaging Cherenkov (RICH) detectors. Photons, electrons and hadrons are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter and a hadronic calorimeter. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers. The online event selection is performed by a trigger, which consists of a hardware stage, based on information from the calorimeter and muon systems, followed by a software stage, which applies a full event reconstruction. At the hardware trigger stage, events are required to contain a muon with high p T or a hadron, photon or electron with high transverse energy in the calorimeters. The software trigger requires a two-, three-or four-track secondary vertex with significant displacement from the primary pp interaction vertices. At least one charged particle must have transverse momentum p T > 1. 7 GeV/c and be inconsistent with originating from a PV. A multivariate algorithm [21] is used for the identification of",

The BDT requirement is 95% efficient for simulated signal candidates and rejects 70% of the combinatorial background. After applying the BDT requirement, specific background contributions containing two real oppositely charged kaons and two real oppositely charged pions are removed by mass vetoes on the two-and three-body invariant masses. Candidates are removed if they fulfill either m(K + K \u2212 \u03c0 \u00b1 ) < 2100 MeV/c 2 or m(K + K \u2212 ) within 30 MeV/c 2 of the known D 0 mass [15]. Sources of peaking background in which one of the final-state tracks is misidentified are suppressed by introducing further JHEP03(2018)140 particle identification requirements. The particle identification quantities make use of information from the RICH detectors and are calibrated using D * + \u2192 D 0 \u03c0 + and \u039b 0 b \u2192 \u039b + c \u00b5 \u2212 \u03bd \u00b5 decays in data.

In addition, there are specific extra particle identification requirements for candidates whose reconstructed mass falls within \u00b130 MeV/c 2 of the known B 0 or \u039b 0 b mass under the relevant mass-hypothesis change (K \u2192 p, K \u2192 \u03c0 or \u03c0 \u2192 K).

Subsequently, each of these background components is found to have a small effect on the signal determination. After all of the selection criteria have been imposed, 1.4% of selected events contain multiple candidates, from which one is randomly selected.

This analysis uses the neuralnetwork-based SS-kaon tagging algorithm presented in ref. [36]; and the combination of OS tagging algorithms explained in ref. [37], based on information from b-hadron decays to electrons, muons or kaons and the total charge of tracks that form a vertex. Both the SS and OS tagging algorithms provide for each event a tagging decision, q, and an estimated mistag probability, \u03b7 tag . The tagging decision takes the value 1 for B 0 s , \u22121 for B 0 s and 0 for untagged. To obtain the calibrated mistag probability for a B 0 s (B 0 s ) meson, \u03c9 (\u03c9), the estimated probability is calibrated on several flavour-specific control channels. The following linear functions are used in the calibration where X \u2208 {OS, SS}, \u03b7 X tag is the mean \u03b7 X tag of the sample, p X 0,1 correspond to calibration parameters averaged over B 0 s and B 0 s , and \u2206p X 0,1 account for B 0 s and B 0 s asymmetries in the calibration. Among other modes, the portability of the SS tagger calibration was checked on B 0 s \u2192 \u03c6\u03c6 decays [36], which are kinematically similar to the considered signal mode. The tagging efficiency, tag , denotes the fraction of candidates with a nonzero tagging decision. The tagging power of the sample, eff = tag (1 \u2212 2 \u03c9 ) 2 , characterises the tagging performance. Information from the SS and OS algorithms is combined on a per-event basis (see eq. (7.3)) for the decay-time-dependent amplitude fit discussed in section 7. The overall effective tagging power is found to be (5.15 \u00b1 0.14)%. The flavourtagging performance is shown in table 3.

However, knowledge of the decay-time resolution is of key importance in the determination of \u03c6 dd s and is consequently included in the decay-time-dependent fit. In this analysis, both acceptance and resolution effects are studied using samples of simulated events which have been weighted to match the data distributions in several important kinematic variables. In the description of the acceptance, the decay-time-dependent part is factorised with respect to the part that depends on the kinematic quantities, since they are found to be only 5% correlated. The acceptance and the decay-time resolutions are determined from simulated events that contain an appropriate combination of the vector-vector B 0 s \u2192 K * 0 K * 0 component with a sample of B 0 s \u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212 K \u2212 \u03c0 + decays generated according to a phase-space distribution. This combination sufficiently populates the phase-space regions to represent the signal decay. To obtain the acceptance function, the simulated events are weighted by the inverse of the probability density function (PDF) used for generation (defined in terms of angles, masses and decay time). The decay-time acceptance is treated analytically and parameterised using cubic spline functions, following the procedure outlined in ref. [39], with the number of knots chosen to be six. The effect of this choice is addressed as a systematic uncertainty in section 8. The decay-time acceptance is shown in figure 5 (bottom right). The fivedimensional kinematic acceptance in angles and masses is included by using normalisation weights in the denominator of the PDF used in the fit to the data, following the procedure described in ref. [40]. When visualising the fit results (see figure 7), the simulated events are weighted using the matrix element of the amplitude fit model. For illustrative purposes, some projections of the kinematic acceptance are shown in figure 5. In order to obtain the best possible sensitivity for the measurement of the \u03c6 dd s phase, the time resolution is evaluated event by event, using the estimated decay-time uncertainty, \u03b4 t , obtained in the track reconstruction process. This variable is calibrated using the simulation sample described above to provide the per-event decay-time resolution, \u03c3 t , using a linear relationship",

The systematic uncertainty is computed as the difference in the fit parameters before and after the iterative correction has been applied. Systematic effects due to the possible mismodelling of the decay-time-dependent acceptance are studied by generating ensembles of pseudoexperiments in two different configurations: one in which the decay-time acceptance spline coefficients are randomised and one in which the configuration of the decay-time acceptance knots is varied. The nominal decay-time-dependent fit procedure is repeated for each pseudoexperiment and the systematic uncertainty for each of these two effects is computed as the average deviation of the fit parameters from their generated values over each ensemble. Sources of systematic uncertainty which affect the decay-time resolution are studied by modifying the calibration function in eq. (6.1) that is used to obtain the perevent decay-time resolution. First, the nominal function is substituted by an alternative quadratic form, to asses the effect of nonlinearity in the calibration. Second, the nominal function is multiplied by a scale factor that accounts for possible remaining differences between data and simulation. This scale factor is taken from the analysis of B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c6 decays performed by LHCb in ref. [42]. In the both cases, the systematic uncertainties are obtained by comparing the values resulting from the alternative configurations with the nominal values.

The value of this phase is measured to be \u03c6 dd s = \u22120.10 \u00b1 0.13 \u00b1 0.14 rad, which is consistent with both the SM expectation [7] and the corresponding LHCb result of \u03c6 ss s = \u22120.17 \u00b1 0.15 \u00b1 0.03 rad measured using B 0 s \u2192 \u03c6\u03c6 decays [12]. The statistical uncertainty of the two measurements is at a similar level although the systematic uncertainty of this measurement is larger, which is mainly due to the treatment of the multi-dimensional acceptance. It is expected that this can be reduced by increasing the size of the simulation sample used to determine the acceptance effects. Most other sources of systematic uncertainty are expected to scale with larger data samples. Weighted candidates / ( 1 ps ) LHCb Figure 7.
