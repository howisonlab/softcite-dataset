Level 1 (L1) was based on logic combinations of fast signals coming from various sub-detectors. It required hits in the CHOD and in the first drift chamber compatible with at least one and two tracks respectively, no hit in the AKL veto system and a minimum energy deposition in the calorimeters. This last requirement was 15 GeV for the energy reconstructed in the LKr calorimeter or 30 GeV for the summed energy in the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters. The output rate of the L1 stage was about 50 kHz. The average L1 efficiency, measured with \u039e 0 \u2192 \u039b\u03c0 0 events of energy greater than 70 GeV, was found to be 98.65 \u00b1 0.03%. Level 2 (L2) consisted of a set of 300 MHz processors that reconstructed tracks and vertices from hits in the drift chambers and computed relevant physical quantities. The L2 trigger required at least two tracks with a closest distance of approach of less than 8 cm in space and a transverse separation greater than 5 cm in the first drift chamber. Since the signature of the \u039e 0 \u03b2-decay involves the detection of an energetic proton from the subsequent \u03a3 + \u2192 p\u03c0 0 decay, the ratio between the higher and the lower of the two track momenta was required to be larger than 3.5. Rejection of the overwhelming \u039b \u2192 p\u03c0 \u2212 and K S \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decays was achieved by applying stringent invariant mass cuts against these decays. The output L2 trigger rate was about 2.5 kHz.

Points with error bars are data. The peak at the \u03a3 + mass value shows clear evidence for the signal. The vertical dashed lines delimit the signal region. The background was evaluated with a likelihood fit of the data performed in two intervals, between 1.164 and 1.180 GeV/c 2 and between 1.198 and 1.240 GeV/c 2 .
