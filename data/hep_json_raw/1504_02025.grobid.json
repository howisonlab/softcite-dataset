            "text": "The quark model, an outstanding achievement of the last century, provides a rather good description of the hadron spectrum. However, baryon spectroscopy is far from complete, since many of the states expected in the SU(3) multiplets are either undiscovered or not well established [1], especially in the case of cascade hyperons with strangeness S = \u22122, the \u039e * . Due to the small production cross sections and the complicated topology of the final states, only eleven \u039e * states have been observed to date. Few of them are well established with spin-parity determined, and most observations and measurements to date are from bubble chamber experiments or diffractive K \u2212 p interactions [2].",

            "text": "As shown by the Particle Data Group (PDG), most \u039e * hyperon results obtained to date have limited statistics [2]. For example, the \u039e(1690) \u2212 was first observed in the \u03a3K final state in the reaction K \u2212 p \u2192 (\u03a3K)K\u03c0 [3]. Afterwards its existence has been confirmed by other experiments [4][5][6], but its spin-parity was not well determined. More recently, BABAR reported evidence for J P = 1/2 \u2212 for the \u039e(1690) by analyzing the Legendre Polynomial moments of the \u039e \u2212 \u03c0 + system in the decay \u039b + c \u2192 \u039e \u2212 \u03c0 + K + [7]. Clear evidence for \u039e(1820) was observed in the K \u2212 \u039b mass spectrum from a sample of 130\u00b116 events in K \u2212 p interactions [8], and the J = 1/2 assumption was ruled out by using the Byers and Fenster technique [9]. Ten years later, a CERN-SPS experiment indicated that \u039e(1820) favors negative parity in the case of J = 3/2 [10].",

Besides scattering experiments, decays from charmonium states offer a good opportunity to search for additional \u039e * states. Although charmonium decays into pairs of \u039e ( * ) states are suppressed by the limited phase space, the narrow charmonium width which reduces the overlap with the neighboring states and the low background allow the investigation of these hyperons with high statistics charmonium samples.",

A good photon is required to have a minimum energy of 25 MeV in the EMC barrel region (| cos(\u03b8)| < 0.8) and 50 MeV in the end-cap region (0.86 < | cos(\u03b8)| < 0.92). A timing requirement (0 \u2264 t \u2264 700 ns) is applied to further suppress electronic noise and energy deposition unrelated to the event. The photon candidate is also required to be isolated from all charged tracks by more than 10 \u2022 .",

For events with more than one good photon, the one with the minimum \u03c7 2 4C is selected. MC studies show that the background arising from \u03c8(3686) \u2192 K \u2212 \u039b\u039e + can be effectively rejected by the 4C-fit and the \u03c7 2 4C requirement. With the above selection criteria, the M (p\u03c0 \u2212 ) distribution is shown in Fig. 4 (a). The \u039b is observed clearly with low background, and the requirement 1.110 < M (p\u03c0 \u2212 ) < 1.121 GeV/c 2 is used to select \u039b candidates. After that, the distribution of M (p\u03c0 + ) is shown in Fig. 4 (b), where the\u039b is observed with almost no background. The requirement 1.110 < M (p\u03c0 + ) < 1.121 GeV/c 2 is further applied to improve the purity. The M (\u039b\u03c0 + ) distribution of the surviving events is shown in Fig. 4 (c), and a mass window requirement 1.315 < M (\u039b\u03c0 + ) < 1.330 GeV/c 2 is used to select \u03c8(3686) \u2192 \u03b3K \u2212 \u039b\u039e + candidates.

The background is also studied with the candidate events within the \u039b or\u039e + sideband regions of data, and the lack of peaking background in the M (\u03b3\u039b) distribution is confirmed. The background from e + e \u2212 annihilation directly is estimated by imposing the same selection criteria on the data sample taken at \u221a s = 3.65 GeV.

The changes in the yields are taken as systematic uncertainties. (3) Fit range: Fits with varied fit ranges, i.e., by expanding/contracting the range by 10 MeV/c 2 and shifting left and right by 10 MeV/c 2 , are performed. The resulting largest differences are treated as the systematic uncertainties. (4) Mass shift and resolution difference: In the measurement of branching fractions related to \u039e * \u2212 , a Gaussian function G(m, \u00b5, \u03c3), which represents the \u039e * \u2212 mass resolution, is included in the fit, where the parameters of Gaussian function are evaluated from MC simulation. To estimate the systematic uncertainty related to the mass shift and resolution difference between data and MC simulation, a fit with a new Gaussian function with additional parameters, i.e., G(m, \u00b5 + \u2206\u00b5, \u03c3 + \u2206\u03c3), is performed, and the resulting difference is taken as the systematic uncertainty. The additional values \u2206\u00b5 and \u2206\u03c3 are estimated by the difference in the fit results of the \u039b and\u039e + between data and MC simulation.g. Mass window requirement:",
