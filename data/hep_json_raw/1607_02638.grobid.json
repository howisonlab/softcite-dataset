Recently, several experiments have reported the likely presence of structures in the J/\u03c8\u03c6(1020) mass spectrum from B \u00b1 \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c6(1020)K \u00b1 decays [1][2][3][4][5][6][7]. A natural extension of these results is to study the \u03c8(2S)\u03c6(1020)K \u00b1 and the \u03c8(2S)\u03c6(1020) mass spectra. As part of that investigation, we report the first observation of the decay B \u00b1 \u2192 \u03c8(2S)\u03c6(1020)K \u00b1 , with \u03c8(2S) \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 and \u03c6(1020) \u2192 K + K \u2212 .

An extended unbinned maximumlikelihood estimator from RooFit [16] is used to perform the fit to the data, using two Gaussian functions for the signal and a firstorder polynomial for the background. The two Gaussian functions share a common mean fixed to the nominal B + mass [13]  MC simulations generated using evtgen [11], which models the f 0 distribution as a coupled-channel Breit-Wigner function [17]. Both the nonresonant K + K \u2212 and f 0 contributions are distorted through the selection of the K + K \u2212 pair closest to the nominal \u03c6 mass. We parametrize these forms using Gaussian functions that are very similar for the two components. Their correlation coefficients show that the two contributions are strongly anticorrelated, and we therefore choose the nonresonant K + K \u2212 background in the fit to represent both the f 0 and any other K + K \u2212 components, and label it as the non-\u03c6 contribution to the signal.  Fig. 2(a) thereby provides the non-B + background. Both the distributions share the same non-B + background function. We find (not displayed) that the non-B + contribution within the B + mass window is of 194 \u00b1 14 events, obtained from a fit to the \u03c8(2S)\u03c6K + invariant mass spectrum. In the simultaneous fit, we therefore fix this number to 194, while the number of non-B + events contributing in the sidebands is allowed to vary.",

The uncertainty from modeling the shape of the B + invariant mass distribution is estimated to be 8.6% by allowing the widths of the two Gaussian functions to vary in the fit, with the background function fixed to a first order polynomial. Systematic uncertainties from sources such as muon identification, trigger efficiency, and track reconstruction efficiency for the three common tracks (two muons and a kaon) almost cancel in the measurement of the signal branching fraction. The uncertainty in the charged particle track reconstruction efficiency, obtained in an independent study by comparing two-body and four-body D 0 decays in data and simulated events [8], gives an uncertainty of 3.9% per track and a total uncertainty of 7.8% for the two additional kaon tracks. A mismatch in the p T distribution between B + mesons in MC simulations and in data can lead to an incorrect efficiency. We therefore reweight the signal and normalization events using a weighting function derived from the normalization channel.
