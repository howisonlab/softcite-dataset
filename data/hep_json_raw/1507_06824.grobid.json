These asymmetries can be attributed to the Collins fragmentation function. We observe a nonzero asymmetry, which increases with increasing pion momentum. As our energy scale is close to that of the existing semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering experimental data, the measured asymmetries are important inputs for the global analysis of extracting the quark transversity distribution inside the nucleon, and are valuable to explore the energy evolution of the spin-dependent fragmentation function. The quark-hadron fragmentation process is parameterized with a fragmentation function (FF), which describes the probability that a hadron carrying a fraction of the parton energy is found in the hadronization debris of the fragmenting parton. The Collins FF, which considers the spin-dependent effects in fragmentation processes, was first discussed by Collins in Ref. [1]. It connects the transverse quark spin with a measurable azimuthal asymmetry (the so-called Collins effect) in the distribution of hadronic fragments along the initial quark's momentum.",

            "text": "The measurement of the Collins FF provides an important test in understanding strong interaction dynamics and thus is of fundamental interest in understanding QCD, the underlying theory of the strong interaction. Due to its chiral-odd nature, it needs to couple to another chiral-odd function, for instance the transversity distribution [2][3][4] in semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering (SIDIS) or another Collins FF in e + e \u2212 annihilations, to form accessible observables. The transversity distribution, which contributes to the nucleon transverse spin, corresponds to the tensor charge of the nucleon and is the least known leading-twist quark distribution function. There have been several SIDIS measurements of this asymmetry from HERMES [5,6], COMPASS [7] and JLab [8]. Direct information on the Collins FF can be obtained from e + e \u2212 annihilation experiments, as suggested in Ref. [9]. Measurements performed by the Belle [10][11][12] and BABAR [13] Collaborations give consistent non-zero asymmetries. Based on the universality of the involved functions in e + e \u2212 and SIDIS [14] experiments, global analyses [15,16] have been performed to simultaneously extract the transversity and Collins FF. However, the e + e \u2212 Collins asymmetries taken from Belle and BABAR correspond to considerably higher Q 2 (\u2248 100 GeV 2 ) than the typical energy scale of the existing SIDIS data (mostly 2-20 GeV 2 ). Therefore, the energy evolution of the Collins FF at different Q 2 is a key factor to evaluate the transversity [17]. Recently, the treatment of the evolution is developed in Ref [18][19][20][21][22], which predict about a factor of two change in the observed asymmetries between BESIII energy and Belle/BABAR energy, but is not directly validated by experimental data. The BESIII experiment [23] studies e + e \u2212 annihilations at a moderate energy scale (4-20 GeV 2 ). It is important to investigate on the interesting feature of Collins FF at this energy scale, and the results can then be connected more directly to the SIDIS. Moreover, as emphasized in Ref [18], with significantly lower Q 2 with respect to B factories, the results will be crucial to explore the Q 2 evolution of the Collins FF and further the uncertainty of the extracted transversity, thus improve our understanding of both Collins FF and transversity.",

It is required that the cluster timing delay from the reconstructed event start time does not exceed 700 ns in order to suppress electronic noise and energy deposits unrelated to the event. To select inclusive e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0X events, at least three charged tracks are required in order to strongly suppress two body decays. At least two of the charged tracks should be identified as pions. To suppress QED backgrounds with the final state \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 and un-physical backgrounds, e.g. beam-gas interactions, the visible energy in the detector, which is defined as the total energy of all reconstructed charged tracks and photons, is required to be larger than 1.5 GeV and no electron must be present in the event. Studies based on MC samples indicate that the backgrounds are suppressed to a negligible level, less than 2.5%. We select pion pairs with z 1(2) \u2208 [0.2, 0.9], where the lower bound is used to reduce pions originated from resonance decays (mostly \u03c1, f ), and the upper bound is used to reject two body decays. Compared to measurement at higher energy scale [10,13], there is no clear jet event shape at BESIII which could help to separate the hadrons coming from different fragmenting (anti-)quark. Instead, to select back-to-back pions, we require the opening angle of the two charged pion candidates to be larger than 120 \u2022 . This requirement reduces the possibility that two pions come from the fragmentation of the same quark. We label the two pions randomly as h 1 and h 2 , and we use the momentum direction of h 2 as reference axis. If more than two pions are present in an event, they are combined to each other, which means each pion is allowed to be assigned to different pion pairs. In the final event selection, 331696 events survived, which provide 557204 available charged pion pairs.",

The normalized ratios are built for unlike-sign (\u03c0 \u00b1 \u03c0 \u2213 ), like-sign (\u03c0 \u00b1 \u03c0 \u00b1 ) and all pion-pairs (\u03c0\u03c0), defined as R U , R L and R C , respectively, in which different combinations of favored FFs and disfavored FFs are involved. A favored fragmentation process refers to the fragmentation of a quark into a hadron containing a valence quark of the same flavor, for example u(d) \u2192 \u03c0 + , while the corresponding u(d) \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 is a disfavored process. Since the normalized ratio R is strongly affected by detector acceptance, we use double ratios R U /R L(C) (UL and UC ratios) [10,11] to extract the azimuthal asymmetries. The gluon radiation may induce a cos(2\u03c6 ) modulation according to Ref. [30], but it is highly suppressed at the BESIII energy scale and is independent of the charge of the pions. Through the double ratios, chargeindependent instrumental effects cancel out, and QCD radiative effects are negligible at the first order, while the charge-dependent Collins asymmetries are kept. The double ratio R U /R L(C) follows the expression",

In (z 1 , z 2 ) bins, the boundaries are set at z i = 0.2, 0.3, 0.5 and 0.9 (i = 1, 2), where complementary off-diagonal bins (z 1 , z 2 ) and (z 2 , z 1 ) are combined. In each bin, normalized rates R U,L,C and double ratios R U /R L,C are evaluated. In Fig. 2, the distributions of the double ratio R U /R L are shown as an exam- ple for two highest (z 1 , z 2 ) bins with the fit results using Eq. (3). The asymmetry values (A) obtained from the fits are shown as a function of six symmetric (z 1 , z 2 ) bins, p t and sin 2 \u03b8 2 /(1 + cos 2 \u03b8 2 ) bins in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4, respectively. The numerical results in each (z 1 ,z 2 ) and p t bins are listed in Table I. Several potential sources of systematic uncertainties are investigated and all systematic uncertainties are added in quadrature finally. An important test is the extraction of double ratios from MC samples, in which the Collins asymmetries are not included but radiative gluon and detector acceptance effects are taken into account. In the MC samples, which is about 10 times of data statistics, double ratios are found to be consistent with zero in all bins within statistical uncertainties. To test any potential smearing effects in the reconstruction process, MC samples are reweighted to produce generated asymmetries which vary in (0.02, 0.15) for UL ratios and (0.01, 0.08) for UC ratios in different bins. The reconstructed asymmetries are basically consistent with input, the differences between them, which range from 0.2% to 48% for UL ratios and range from 2% to 31% for UC ratios relatively, are included in the systematic uncertainties.",

Thus, a linear fit is performed to the points in Fig. 4, with the constant term set to be zero or left as a free parameter, which gives the reduced \u03c7 2 to be 2.3 or 2.8 for A UL and 1.7 or 1.9 for A UC respectively. The significance for a zero offset is only about 1\u03c3 for both A UL and A UC .",

Our results suggest nonzero asymmetry in the region of large fractional energy z, which can be attributed to the product of a quark and an anti-quark Collins function. This is the first measurement of the Collins asymmetry at low energy scale (Q 2 \u2248 13 GeV 2 ) in e + e \u2212 annihilation. The observed asymmetry indicates larger spin-dependent Collins effect than those at the higher energy scale from B factories [10][11][12][13]. The results are of great importance to explore the Q 2 evolution of the Collins function and extract transversity distributions in nucleon.",
