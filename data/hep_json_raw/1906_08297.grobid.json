One important example is B 0 \u2192 DK * 0 [6], where K * 0 is the K * (892) 0 meson and is reconstructed in its decay to K + \u03c0 \u2212 . This process involves the interference of B 0 \u2192 D 0 K * 0 decays, which proceed via a b \u2192 c quark transition, and B 0 \u2192 D 0 K * 0 decays, which involve a b \u2192 u quark transition and are therefore suppressed relative to B 0 \u2192 D 0 K * 0 . Feynman diagrams of these decays are shown in figure 1. Both transitions are colour-suppressed, in contrast to the charged B-meson case where only the b \u2192 u transition is colour-suppressed. This leads to a greater suppression of the overall decay rates, but with the benefit of enhanced interference effects with respect to B + \u2192 DK + decays. The ratio r DK * 0 B between the magnitudes of the suppressed and favoured B 0 decay amplitudes is expected to be around three times larger than the corresponding parameter in B + \u2192 DK + decays.",
