In this approach, the heavy quarks emit two gluons that subsequently transform into light hadrons. The \u03c0\u03c0 and \u03b7 transitions between the vector states proceed via emission of E1E1 and E1M2 gluons, respectively. Therefore, \u03b7 transitions are highly suppressed as they require a spin flip of the heavy quark [11,12]. In-deed, the ratio of branching fractions is measured to be small for low-lying states: R \u03b7S \u03c0\u03c0S (2, 1) = (1.64 \u00b1 0.23) \u00d7 10 \u22123 [13][14][15] and R \u03b7S \u03c0\u03c0S (3, 1) < 2.3 \u00d7 10 \u22123 [14].",

An energy threshold, ranging from 50 MeV to 95 MeV, is applied as a function of the polar angle to reject low energy photons arising from the beam-related backgrounds. To reject photons from \u03c0 0 decays, \u03b3\u03b3 pairs having invariant mass within 17 MeV/c 2 of the nominal \u03c0 0 mass [34] are identified as \u03c0 0 candidates and the corresponding photons are excluded from the \u03b7 reconstruction process. The angle \u03b8 between the photon direction and that of the \u03a5(4S) in the \u03b7 rest frame peaks at cos(\u03b8) \u2248 1 for the remaining combinatorial background. We thus require cos(\u03b8) < 0.94 for the \u03b7 selection. All the selection criteria are optimized using the MC simulation by maximizing the figure of merit f = N sig / N sig + N bkg , where N sig and N bkg are the signal and background yields in the signal region, respectively. The \u03b7 peak in the \u03b3\u03b3 invariant mass distribution, after the selection is applied, can be fit by a Crystal Ball (CB) [35]  MeV/c 2 [34]. The M miss (\u03b7) spectrum is fitted in two separate intervals: (9.30, 9.70) GeV/c 2 and (9.70, 10.00) GeV/c 2 . In the first (second) interval, the combinatorial background is described with a 6 th -order (11 th ) Chebyshev polynomial. The polynomial order is determined maximizing the confidence level of the fit and is validated using sideband samples. Figure 1 shows the backgroundsubtracted M miss (\u03b7) distribution, with a bin size 50 times larger than that used for the fit. The confidence levels of the fits are 1% in the lower interval and 19% in the upper one. The transition \u03a5(4S) \u2192 \u03b7h b (1P ) is observed with a statistical significance of 11\u03c3, calculated using the profile likelihood method [38], and no signal is observed in the \u03b3\u03b3-mass control regions. The h b (1P ) yield is N h b (1P ) = 112469 \u00b1 5537. From the position of the peak, we measure M h b (1P ) = (9899.3 \u00b1 0.4 \u00b1 1.0) MeV/c 2 (hereinafter the first error is statistical and the second is systematic).

A \u00b11% uncertainty is assigned for the efficiency of the hadronic event selection. The uncertainty on the photon reconstruction efficiency is estimated using D \u2192 K \u00b1 \u03c0 \u2213 \u03c0 0 events to be \u00b12.8% per photon, corresponding to \u00b15.6% per \u03b7.

The uncertainty on the B meson mass [34] limits the precision on M h b (1P ) to \u00b10.4 MeV/c 2 , while it has a negligible effect on the branching ratio measurement.

This process is found to be the strongest known transition from the \u03a5(4S) meson to lower bottomonium states. A new measurement of the h b (1P ) mass is presented.

To estimate the systematic uncertainties reported in Table II, we adopt the methods discussed earlier. Uncertainties related to the M miss (\u03b7) TABLE II. Systematic uncertainties in the determination of the \u03b7 b (1S) mass and width in units of MeV/c 2 , and on B = B[h b (1P ) \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7 b (1S) in units of %.fit are determined by changing the fit range, the bin width, the background-polynomial order and the fixed values of M h b (1P ) used in the fits. Similarly, the uncertainties arising from the \u2206M miss fit are studied by repeating it with different ranges and binning. The calibration uncertainty accounts for the errors on the photon energy calibration factors. The uncertainty due to the ratio of the reconstruction efficiencies arises entirely from the single-photon reconstruction efficiency. The \u03b7 b (1S) annihilates into two gluons, while the h b (1P ) annihilates predominantly into three gluons, but the MC simulation indicates no significant difference in the R 2 distribution. Therefore, the continuum suppression cut does not contribute to the uncertainty arising from the reconstruction efficiency ratio. We calculate the \u03b7b (1S) mass as M \u03b7 b (1S) = M h b (1P ) + \u2206M miss = (9400.7 \u00b1 1.7 \u00b1 1.6) MeV/c 2 . Assuming m \u03a5(1S) = (9460.30 \u00b1 0.26) MeV/c 2 [34], we calculate \u2206M HF (1S) = (59.6\u00b11.7\u00b11.6) MeV/c 2 .A summary of the results presented in this work is shown in",
