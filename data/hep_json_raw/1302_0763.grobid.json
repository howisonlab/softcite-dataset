During the first two LHC heavy-ion runs, in the falls of 2010 and 2011, the ALICE experiment recorded Pb-Pb collisions at a centre-of-mass energy per nucleon pair of \u221a s NN = 2.76 TeV and could profit of an integrated luminosity of about 10 \u00b5b \u22121 and 100 \u00b5b \u22121 , respectively. The instant luminosity exceeded 10 26 cm \u22122 s \u22121 in the second run, higher than the design value. Proton-lead (p-Pb) collision data were also recorded with the ALICE detector. This occured during a short run performed in September 2012 in preparation for the main p-Pb run scheduled at the beginning of 2013. Each beam contained 13 bunches; 8 pairs of bunches were colliding in the ALICE interaction region, providing a luminosity of about 8 \u00d7 10 25 cm \u22122 s \u22121 . Beam 1 consisted of protons at 4 TeV energy circulating in the negative z-direction in the ALICE laboratory system, while beam 2 consisted of fully stripped 208 Pb ions at 82 \u00d7 4 TeV energy circulating in the positive z-direction.

It was previously shown that the production of charged hadrons in central Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC is strongly suppressed [5,6]. The suppression remains substantial up to 100 GeV/c and is also seen in reconstructed jets [7]. Proton-lead collisions provide a control experiment to establish whether the initial state of the colliding nuclei plays a role in the observed high-p T hadron production in Pb-Pb collisions. In order to quantify nuclear effects, the p T -differential yield relative to the proton-proton reference, the so-called nuclear modification factor, is calculated. The nuclear modification factor is unity for hard processes which are expected to exhibit binary collision scaling. This has been recently confirmed in Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC by the measurements of direct photon, Z 0 and W \u00b1 production, observables which are not affected by hot QCD matter. In Figure 3 the measurement of the nuclear modification factor in p-Pb collisions R pPb is compared to that in central (0-5% centrality) and peripheral (70-80%) Pb-Pb collisions R PbPb . R pPb is observed to be consistent with unity for transverse momenta higher that about 2 GeV/c. This demonstrates that the strong suppression observed in central Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC is not due to an initial-state effect, but it is rather a final state effect related to the hot matter created in high-energy heavyion collisions.",

On the other hand, in the case of central (0-40% centrality) Pb-Pb collisions the direct photon signal is well reproduced by NLO pQCD only for photon momenta above 4 GeV/c, as shown in Figure 5. The low-p T excess, of about 20% at around 2 GeV/c, is attributed to thermal photons, that is photons produced in the QGP phase by the scattering of thermalized partons. The thermalized nature of the production medium should be reflected in the p T distribution of thermal photons. The excess over NLO pQCD is fit in Figure 5 with an exponential in the p T range 0.8-2.2 MeV. The LHC value is about 40% higher than the one measured at RHIC.",

The spectral shapes are harder than those measured at RHIC, indicating a strong increase of the radial flow velocity with the centre-of-mass energy. The radial flow at the LHC is found to be about 10% higher than at RHIC energy. While the K/\u03c0 integrated production ratio is measured to be in line with lower energy results and predictions from the thermal model, both the p/\u03c0 and the \u039b/\u03c0 ratios are lower than at RHIC and significantly lower (a factor \u223c 1.5) than predictions.

The observed production ratios are not reproduced by NLO calculations. PYTHIA Monte Carlo generator underpredicts the proton-to-pion ratio at intermediate p T . Pion, kaon and (anti)proton production in Pb-Pb collisions were compared to that of proton-proton interactions and all show a suppression pattern which is similar to that of inclusive charged hadrons at high momenta (p T above 10 GeV/c) [14]. This suggests that the dense medium formed in Pb-Pb collisions does not affect the fragmentation. A similar conclusion can be drawn by observing the protonto-pion ratio measured in Pb-Pb collisions: for intermediate momenta (3-7 GeV/c) it exibits a relatively strong enhancement, a factor 3 higher than proton-proton collisions at p T \u2248 3 GeV/c and gets back to the proton-proton value at higher momenta (p T above 10 GeV/c) [14]. A similar observation is reported also for the \u039b/K 0 s ratio and possible explanations include among those proposed so far particle production via quark recombination [15].",

In particular, the relative production of heavy-flavour particles with respect to that in nucleon-nucleon interaction show a suppression of up to a factor of 5 at p T \u223c 10 GeV/c in central Pb-Pb collisions (0-7.5% centrality). The suppression is observed to be similar for the three studied decay channels, that is heavy-flavour electrons, heavy-flavour muons and prompt D mesons. The average D meson production suppression is shown in Figure 10 as a function of the number of participating nucleons and it is compared with the measurement of non-prompt J/\u03c8 suppression performed by CMS [25]. The suppression of non-prompt J/\u03c8 from B meson decays reflects the in-medium energy loss of b quarks. The two measurements provide a first indication of different suppression for charm and beauty in central collisions, that is of different in-medium energy loss.",
