            "text": "Lorentz symmetry is a fundamental space-time symmetry underlying both the Standard Model of particle physics and general relativity. This symmetry guarantees that physical phenomena are observed to be the same by all inertial observers. However, unified theories, such as string theory, allow for violation of this symmetry by inducing new space-time structure at the quantum gravity scale. Thus, the discovery of Lorentz symmetry violation could be the first hint of these theories in Nature. Here we report the results of the most precise test of space-time symmetry in the neutrino sector to date. We use high-energy atmospheric neutrinos observed at the IceCube Neutrino Observatory to search for anomalous neutrino oscillations as signals of Lorentz violation. We find no evidence for such phenomena. This allows us to constrain the size of the dimension-four",

            "text": "Very small violations of Lorentz symmetry, or \"Lorentz violation\" (LV), are allowed in many ultra-high-energy theories, including string theory [1], noncommutative field theory [2], and supersymmetry [3]. The discovery of LV could be the first indication of such new physics. Because of this, there are world-wide efforts underway to search for evidence of LV. The Standard-Model Extension (SME) is an effective-field-theory framework to systematically study LV [4]. The SME includes all possible types of LV which respect other symmetries of the Standard Model such as energy-momentum conservation and coordinate independence. Thus, the SME can provide a framework to compare results of LV searches from many different fields such as photons [5][6][7][8], nucleons [9][10][11], charged leptons [12][13][14], and gravity [15]. Recently, neutrino experiments have performed searches for LV [16][17][18]. So far all searches have obtained null results. The full list of existing limits from all sectors and a brief overview of the field are available elsewhere [19,20]. Our focus here is to present the most precise test of LV in the neutrino sector.",

Therefore, if we compare the zenith angle distribution (\u03b8) of the expectation from simulations and \u03bd \u00b5 data from cos \u03b8 = \u22121.0 (vertical) to cos \u03b8 = 0.0 (horizontal), see Fig. 1, then one can determine the allowed LV parameters. Figure 2 shows the ratio of transition probabilities of vertical events to horizontal events. The data transition probability is defined by the ratio of observed events to expected events, and the simulation transition probability is defined by the expected events in the presence of LV to the number of events in the absence of LV. In the absence of LV, this ratio equals one. Here, as an example, we show several predictions from simulations with different dimension-six LV parameters | \u2022 c (6) \u00b5\u03c4 |. In general, higher order terms are more important at higher energies. In order to assess the existence of LV, we perform a binned Poisson likelihood analysis by binning the data in zenith angle and energy. We use 10 linearlyspaced bins in cosine of zenith angle from \u22121.0 to 0.0 and 17 logarithmically-spaced bins in reconstructed muon energy ranging from 400 GeV to 18 TeV. Systematic uncertainties are incorporated as nuisance parameters in our likelihood. We introduce six systematic parameters related to the neutrino flux prediction: normalizations of conventional (40% error), prompt (no constraint), and astrophysical (no constraint) neutrino flux components; ratio of pion and kaon contributions for conventional flux (10% error); spectral index of primary cosmic rays (2% error); and astrophysical neutrino spectral index (25% error). The absolute photon detection efficiency has been shown to have negligible impact on the exclusion contours in a search for sterile neutrinos that uses an equivalent analysis technique for a subset of the IceCube data considered here [34,37]. The impact of light propagation model uncertainties on the horizontal to vertical ratio is less than 5% at few TeV, where this analysis is most sensitive [35]. Thus the impact of these uncertainties on the exclusion contours are negligible.",

            "text": "To constrain the LV parameters we use two statistical techniques. First, we performed a likelihood analysis by profiling the likelihood over the nuisance parameters per set of LV parameters. From the profiled likelihood, we find the best-fit LV parameters and derive the 90% and 99% confidence levels (C.L.) assuming Wilks' theorem with three degrees of freedom [37]. Second, we set the priors to the nuisance parameter uncertainties and scan the posterior space of the likelihood by means of a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method [38]. These two procedures are found to be complementary, and the extracted LV parameters agree with the null hypothesis. For simplicity, we present the likelihood results in this paper and show the MCMC results in Methods Supplementary material Appendix B. \u00b5\u00b5 /\u03c1 6 . The best-fit point shown by the marker is compatible with the absence of LV; therefore, we present 90% C.L. (red) and 99% C.L. (blue) exclusion regions. The contour extends to small values, beyond the phase space explored by previous analyses [16][17][18]. The leftmost edge of our exclusion region is limited by the small statistics of high-energy atmospheric neutrinos. The rightmost edge of the exclusion region is limited by fast LV-induced oscillations that suppress the flux but lead to no shape distortion. This can only be constrained by the absolute normalization of the flux. In the case of the dimensionthree operator, the right edge can be excluded by other atmospheric neutrino oscillation measurements [18,39]. We have studied the applicability of Wilks' theorem via simulations. Near degenerate real and imaginary parameters reduce the expected degrees of freedom from three and the results here are interpreted as conservative confidence intervals.",

This induces the quantum Zeno effect [40], where a neutrino flavour state is \"arrested\" in one state by a continuous interaction with a LV field suppressing flavour transitions. Thus, the unshaded regions below and above our exclusion zone are very difficult to constrain with terrestrial experiments. Table I summarizes the results of this work along with representative best limits. A comprehensive list of LV tests is available in [19]. To date, there is no experimental indication of LV, and all these experiments have maximized their limits by assuming that all but one of the SME parameters are zero [19]. Therefore, to make our results comparable with previous limits, we adopt the same convention. For this, we set the diagonal SME parameters to zero and focus on setting limits on the off-diagonal elements. The details of the procedure used to set limits are given in Supplementary material Appendix D.",

These are the main focus of experiments using photons [7,8], nucleons [10,11], and charged leptons [12][13][14]. Going beyond terrestrial experiments, limits arising from astrophysical observations provide strong constraints [5,6]. Among the variety of limits coming from the neutrino sector, the attainable best limits are dominated by atmospheric neutrino oscillation analyses [16][17][18], where the longest propagation length and the highest energies enable us to use neutrino oscillations as the biggest interferometer on the Earth. The results from our analysis surpass past ones due to the higher statistics of high-energy atmospheric neutrinos and our improved control of systematic uncertainties. Using a traditional metric, which assumes neutrinos to be massless, we can recast our result as an upper limit on any deviation of the speed of massless neutrinos from the speed of light due to LV. That is less than 10 \u221228 at 99% CL. This is about an order of magnitude improvement over past analyses [16][17][18], and is of the same order as the deviation in speed that is expected due to the known neutrino mass at the energies relevant for this analysis.",

Among them, ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) have the highest measured energy [41] and are used to set the strongest limits on dimension-six and higher operators [9]. However, these limits are sensitive to the composition of UHECRs, which is currently uncertain [20,42]. These limits assume that the cosmic rays at the highest energies are protons, but if they are in fact iron nuclei, then the UHECR limits are significantly reduced. Our analysis sets the most stringent limits in an unambiguous way across all fields for the dimension-six operator. Such high-dimension operators are generic signatures of new physics [43]. For example, dimension-five operator  is an attractive possibility to produce neutrino masses, and dimension-six operators represent new physics interactions which can, for example, mediate proton decay.

Comparison with limits from other sectors reveals that this work provides among the best attainable limits on dimension-six coefficients across all fields: from tabletop experiments to cosmology. This is a remarkable point that demonstrates how powerful neutrino interfer-ometry can be in the study of fundamental space-time properties.",

In the early days, the cause of neutrino oscillations was not precisely known, and Lorentz violation was suggested as a possible source of neutrino flavour anomalies [65] and so tests of Lorentz violation with highenergy astrophysical sources started to generate a lot of interest [66]. Subsequetly, the L/E dependence of standard neutrino oscillations was measured [56]. Because the neutrino mass term in the effective Hamiltonian has a 1/E energy dependence, it was a strong indication that a nonzero neutrino mass is in fact the cause of neutrino oscillations, not Lorentz violation. Then, the focus of the community shifted to consider Lorentz violation to be a second order effect in neutrino oscillations, and so neutrino oscillation data has been used to look for small deviations due to Lorentz violation from the standard neutrino mass oscillations.",

            "text": "One approach to look for LV is to use a modelindependent effective field theory, such as the Standard-Model Extension (SME) [67,68]. SME is widely accepted in communities from low-energy table top experiments to high-energy particle physics and cosmology, to search for Lorentz violation. This formalism incorporates various fundamental features of quantum field theories, such as energy-momentum conservation, observer Lorentz transformations, and spin-statistics, however it includes violations of particle Lorentz transformations. A number of neutrino oscillation data sets have been analyzed using this formalism, including LSND [70], Mini-BooNE [71], MINOS [72][73][74][75], Double Chooz [76,77], SNO [78], T2K [79], as well as the aforementioned IceCube-40 and Super-Kamiokande. These experiments can be classified into two groups. First, the presence of a direction-dependent field induces direction-dependent physics. In particular, neutrino beam lines are fixed and so such direction-dependent physics would show up as a time-dependence of neutrino oscillation data [70-76, 78, 79]. Second, a search of Lorentz violation is possible even without assuming the presence of a spatial component, i.e. no time-dependent physics, by utilizing distortions of the spectrum [77]. The results presented in this article are based on this second approach.",
