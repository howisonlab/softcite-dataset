            "text": "The top quark, t, is the heaviest known elementary particle and was discovered at the Tevatron pp collider in 1995 by the CDF and D\u00d8 collaborations 1, 2 with a mass around 173 GeV. Top quark mass measurements together with measurements of the W boson mass and the mass of the recently observed Higgs boson provide a strong self-consistency test of the standard model (SM). The production of top quarks at the Tevatron is dominated by the qq annihilation process, contributing 85% of the total production cross section as opposed to gluon-gluon fusion which contributes only 15%. In contrast, at the LHC these fractions are approximately reversed. The different initial state allows for complementary and unique measurements at the Tevatron. The top quark has a very short lifetime of \u03c4 \u2248 10 \u221225 s, 3,4 which prevents any hadronization process of the top quark, allowing to uniquely observe bare quark properties by measuring properties of the top quarks. Top quarks are produced either as top quark-antiquark pairs (tt) via the strong interaction (qq \u2192 tt), providing a direct test of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), or as single top quarks via electroweak processes, testing the electroweak theory and providing a direct probe of the CKM matrix element V tb . Three different channels contribute to the production of single top quarks: the t-channel (q \u2032 g \u2192 tqb), the s-channel (qq \u2032 \u2192 tb), and the associated tW -channel (gb \u2192 tW ). The latter has a very small production cross section at the Tevatron, making this channel essentially negligible for most measurements at the Tevatron. The measurements discussed here are the most current ones and use either the dilepton (\u2113\u2113) final state or the lepton+jets (\u2113+jets) final state, where \u2113 can be an electron or a muon that can also originate from semi-leptonic \u03c4 decays. In the SM branching fraction for top quarks decaying into W b is almost 100%. Within the \u2113+jets final state one of the W bosons (stemming from the decay of the top quarks) decays leptonically, and the other W boson decays hadronically. For the dilepton final state both W bosons decay leptonically. This review of the most current results of the Tevatron experiments is loosely related to a talk summarizing measurements at the Tevatron given earlier in 2013 at DESY. It is organized as follows: Section 2 summarizes measurements on inclusive and differential top quark production cross sections and related measurements in the strong and electroweak sector. Section 3 summarizes measurements of angular distributions related to asymmetries in the production of top quarks and measurements of the correlation of the spin of the top quark. Section 4 outlines the current status of the precision measurement of the mass of the top quark. Where available, combinations of CDF and D\u00d8 results are discussed as well. A short review like the one presented here can not do justice to the wealth of measurements in the top quark sector at the Tevatron and much more complete information can be found in the publications of each experiment. 5, 6",

            "text": "Measurements of inclusive and differential cross sections deepen our understanding of the theory modeling the production of top quarks. In particular measurements of tt pair production tests perturbative QCD, and provide important information that can improve the simulation of QCD processes. As noted earlier, single top quark production provides tests of the electroweak theory and since new physics can change individual production channels, all production modes of single and pair top quark production are needed to check for possible contributions of new physics. Furthermore, many of what are herein called top quark properties, are in fact differential top quark cross sections of a particular kinematic quantity, for example, the top quark polarization and the forward-backward (charge) asymmetry in tt production at the Tevatron. To identify evidence of new physics in their modeling as provided by perturbative QCD (pQCD) the distributions of these observables needs to be tested as strongly as possible and improved where needed. Theoretical predictions of the tt and single top production processes exist at various orders of perturbation in SM theory. The most recent prediction for tt production is a fully re-summed next-to-next-to-leading log (NNLL) at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) pQCD calculation. 7 The total uncertainty from factorization and Table 1. Theoretical predictions for total top quark production cross sections and their uncertainties for the Tevatron and, for comparison, also for the LHC. renormalization scale variation and uncertainties of the parton density distribution function (PDF) is approximately 3.5% for the Tevatron and approximately 4.3% for the LHC.

Although the calculated cross sections (see Table 2.1.2) are not much smaller compared to the tt cross section, the backgrounds are significantly larger, reducing the signal to background ratio. Simple counting measurements are not possible in this domain and instead more sophisticated algorithms to separate signal and background are applied, for example multivariate analyses techniques. 14,15 The measurements of the single top quark production cross section at the Tevatron rely heavily on the application of those multivariate analyses (MVA).",

The measurement in the \u2113+jets channel uses 5.4 fb \u22121 of data and details on the event selection can be found in the corresponding reference. 24 The selected data are used for a combined measurement using b-tagging and kinematic information divided into separate channels by number of b-tags and jets. Figure 5(b) shows the sample composition of the selected data as a function of the jet multiplicity requiring more than 1 b-tagged jet. As one expects the background contributions rise towards lower jet multiplicity and the tt contribution rises strongly with number of jets (and also with number of b-tags).

A comparison of the most current measurements at the Tevatron including those discussed above is presented in Table 2.

The additional photon candidate is required to have E \u03b3 T > 10 GeV, no track with p T > 1 GeV and at most one track with p T < 1 GeV pointing at the electro- magnetic calorimeter cluster; and minimal leakage into the hadronic calorimeter. Photons are identified by means of a \u03c7 2 measure and a tight cut on this quantity largely suppresses the background. The most dominant remaining background contribution originates from misidentification of jets as photons. To estimate this contribution the isolation cuts are not applied and Z \u2192 ee events are used to extrapolate the isolation shape to the applied cuts at higher isolation values. Taking into account this fake photon contribution and all the other background contributions the expected amount of signal candidate events is 26.9\u00b13.4 (e-and \u00b5-channels combined). The probability of the background alone to mimic the observed signal of 30 events corresponds to three standard deviations (s.d.). The cross section for pp \u2192 tt + \u03b3 is measured to 0.18 \u00b1 0.07 (stat.) \u00b1 0.04 (syst.) \u00b1 0.01 (lumi), which is a factor of 40 lower than the inclusive tt cross section. The cross section and its ratio to the tt cross section of 0.024 \u00b1 0.009 (stat.) \u00b1 0.001 (syst.) are in good agreement to the SM prediction.",

The cross section is determined by dividing by the total integrated luminosity L that corresponds to the selection requirements, for the branching fraction B into the decay channel under consideration, and for the bin width of the particular variable X. Any measurement of a cross section relies on MC samples to correct the data for the detector efficiency and also in order to extrapolate from the fiducial cross section to the total cross section. For this purpose all cross section measurements use current theory predictions at leading-order or next-to-leading order pQCD. The process of correcting the data for detector effects (see Eq.

The sample composition is determined using the discriminant output distribution corresponding to the b-tagged jets in the \u2113 + 2 jets, \u2113 + 3 jets and inclusive \u2113 + 4 jets data. The established sample composition is employed to measure differential tt cross sections in the \u2113 + 4 jets bin. To identify the top quarks a kinematic reconstruction is performed, which takes into account experimental resolutions. All possible permutations of objects are considered, while preferentially assigning b-tagged jets to b-quarks and the chosen solution is the one with the smallest \u03c7 2 . As an example the result of the kinematic reconstruction in the case of the p top T distribution is shown in Fig. 7(a), where the signal contribution is provided by mc@nlo using the CTEQ6M PDF. 31 The p top T , |y top | and m(tt) distributions are background subtracted for all expected contributions and the differential cross sections are determined according to Eq.

By looking at the ratio in Fig. 8(b) a reasonable description of the shape by all predictions, with alpgen being too low in absolute normalization can be seen. Figure 9(a) shows the differential cross section as a function of p top T and (b) as a function of |y top |, where the t andt contributions are averaged. Both distributions are described by the various predictions, with some indication of model deficiencies in the low to mid |y top | region where e.g. the approximate NNLO prediction 33,34 is somewhat low compared to data.

Implications Precise differential cross section distributions provide ample ways of constraining models and sources of new physics. The most direct constraint is set by the m(tt) distribution, which is sensitive to the production of resonances decaying into top quarks, like a Z \u2032 . Another example is the currently puzzling situation at the Tevatron in terms of the enhanced forward-backward asymmetry observed in tt production. The differential top quark cross sections constrain models of new physics, which could explain the effect. CDF employs the tail of m(tt) to constrain new physics contributions. 36 The tail is sensitive to broad enhancements as well as to narrow resonances. There is no indication of beyond standard model contributions to the differential cross section. Furthermore the distribution has been used to derive a limit on gravitons which decay to top quarks in the Randall-Sundrum model. The mass of the first resonance is fixed to 600 GeV and gravitons are modeled using madevent plus pythia for modeling the hadronization effects.

            "text": "As mentioned before an example of the importance of accurate modeling of QCD is given by the deviation observed in the asymmetry measurements in pp \u2192 tt production from SM predictions (see Section 3). Such a difference could be due to the exchange of a new heavy mediator, e.g., an axigluon 41,42 that could also enhance the tt cross section. Differential cross sections provide stringent constraints on axigluon models, where instead of the intermediate gluon an axigluon (or a light Z \u2032 in alternative models) is produced. These models are constructed to result in the observed asymmetries at the Tevatron (see Section 3) and are briefly summarized in  Table 3 in terms of their couplings, masses and corrections to tt cross sections. 43 In addition Table 3 states the \u03c7 2 /ndf values of the measured differential cross sections compared to the various models. The \u03c7 2 takes into account the full covariance matrices of the differential cross section measurement in p top T , |y top | and m(tt). Models implementing heavy masses are usually in tension with existing data from the Tevatron and the LHC, but it is especially the low mass region where the Tevatron data adds sensitivity. Figure 11(a) shows a ratio of the various models introduced earlier to the measured differential tt cross section in m(tt). Figure 11(b) shows the same comparison using the p top T distribution. In contrast to the expectation that m(tt) is the most sensitive distribution, p top T (and |y top |) also add sensitivity. In particular the region with high experimental precision (medium values of p top T ) offers sensitivity to these low mass models. The low mass Z \u2032 model shows significant tension to the data in all three differential distributions as can be seen from the ratios with the \u03c7 2 /ndf values summarized in Table 3.",

Another example not summarized here are spin correlation measurements (more information can be found in Refs. 5,6 ). Experimentally one needs to distinguish between two approaches to measure these asymmetries: Either the tt pair is fully reconstructed using a kinematic reconstruction [44][45][46] or only a final state particle like the lepton ('lepton based asymmetries') is reconstructed. 47,48 The latter avoids the reconstruction of top-quarks, which is PSfrag replacements usually more affected by detector resolution and migration effects. In general the size of the tt asymmetries at the Tevatron or at the LHC is related to the relative weight of the quark annihilation channel in the pair production, because events arising from gg initial states are forward-backward symmetric. At the Tevatron the t andt rapidity distributions are shifted with respect to each other, which is why the measurement of the forward-backward asymmetry in tt production (A FB ) relies on a measurement of \u2206y = y t \u2212 yt. The forward-backward asymmetry is defined as",

The two lepton based asymmetries are correlated, but by combining them a small reduction of uncertainties is observed. CDF uses data corresponding to 9.4 fb \u22121 of integrated luminosity and employs a kinematic reconstruction to reconstruct the tt final state in the \u2113+jets decay channel. CDF measures an inclusive asymmetry of 0.164 \u00b1 0.045 (stat. + syst.) at the parton level and also measures the kinematic dependency of A FB , by measuring \u2206y in bins of m(tt). 46 The dependency of A tt FB is shown in Fig. 12(a). The results show a dependency which is different from the SM expectation by 2.4 standard deviations. D\u00d8 uses the full Run II data corresponding to 9.7 fb \u22121 of integrated luminosity and also fully reconstructs the tt final state using a kinematic reconstruction. The measurement in the \u2113+jets decay channel results in an inclusive asymmetry of 0.106 \u00b1 0.030 (stat. + syst.) at the parton level. 45 The result is compatible with the SM and results by CDF. It agrees within 0.3 standard deviations with the predictions ranging from 5% (mc@nlo) to 8.8% (NLO QCD \u2295 EW corrections). 49 D\u00d8 does not see an indication for a strong m(tt) dependency beyond the one expected by the SM as shown in Fig. 12(b). It should be noted that predictions at NNLO pQCD are really needed to clarify the current picture in terms of deviations of existing A FB measurements versus the predictions. CDF also measures the differential cross section for tt production as a function of the top quark production angle cos \u03b8 t . 50 Events are selected in the \u2113+jets channel by requiring an isolated lepton with a p T of at least 20 GeV, E T > 20 GeV, at least three jets with 20 GeV and at least another loose jet with 12 GeV. Further quality cuts are applied. A complex characterization in terms of Legendre polynomials is carried out and compared to the SM prediction at NLO. The even moments have no contribution to the asymmetry, as the even Legendre polynomials are symmetric. The data agrees with the SM except for the first Legendre moment measured to a 1 = 0.40 \u00b1 0.09 (stat.) \u00b1 0.08 (syst) showing a two s.d. deviation to the SM expectation. This implies that the observed A FB is dominated by this first Legendre moment, which constrains possible contributions of new physics. The D\u00d8 result in terms of the lepton based asymmetries in the \u2113+jets channel is A l FB = 0.047\u00b10.026 (stat. + syst.) at the parton level 47 and in the dilepton channel the corresponding measurement is A l FB = 0.044 \u00b1 0.039 (stat. + syst.), whereas the dilepton asymmetry is measured to be A \u2113\u2113 = 0.123 \u00b1 0.056. It is interesting to note that the ratio of the two lepton based asymmetries in the dilepton channel shows a deviation from the SM prediction of about two standard deviations (see Fig. 13). Combinations within D\u00d8 and across Tevatron are currently being investigated. CDF employs data corresponding to up to 9.4 fb \u22121 of integrated luminosity and measured A l FB = 0.09 +0.028 \u22120.026 after combining their results from \u2113+jets and dilepton channels. 51 The results discussed above are summarized in Fig. 14(a) employing the theoretical predictions for the specific quantity of A FB = 6.6 \u00b1 2% 52 and A l FB = 3.6 \u00b1 1%. 53 Overall the experimental measurements are in excess of the SM prediction for A FB with CDF results showing larger deviations from the SM in various channels. For A l FB experimental results deviate less from the predicted SM value. It should be noted that individual results on A l FB employ the full data recorded by CDF and D\u00d8 and a combination of A l FB is currently ongoing. A summary of the experimental results from the Tevatron and the LHC, which also shows the complementarity of the two machines together with the constraints on possible new physics contributions is provided in Fig. 14(c). Currently the experimental results provide a puzzling situation, as the Tevatron results show indications for deviations from the SM predictions by about one to two s.d., whereas the results from the LHC are not yet significant enough. Both communities are working hard to improve on the measurement techniques and the related uncertainties. A study performed in the context of the CSS 2013 55 discusses the prospects of measurements of A C and their significances at the upcoming run of the LHC.",

As one of the W bosons decays hadronically a constraint on the W mass can be used to fit the jet energy scale in-situ. The measurement uses 3.6 fb \u22121 and is currently the most precise D\u00d8 mass measurement across all decay channels. It yields a mass of m t = 174.9 \u00b1 0.8 (stat.) \u00b1 1.2 (sys. + JES) GeV. The most precise measurement in the dilepton decay channel employs the neutrino weighting technique in 5.4 fb \u22121 of D\u00d8 data, where the measurement integrates over the unknown neutrino momenta. This sample is limited in statistics due to the small B but has very low backgrounds. The in-situ JES correction is transferred from the \u2113+jets measurement and reduces JES uncertainties. The measurement yields m t = 174.0 \u00b1 2.4(stat.) \u00b1 1.4(sys.) GeV. 58 Measurements employing the full Run II data set are currently carried out by D\u00d8 and results are expected very soon. CDF has measured the top quark mass in the dilepton channel using the neutrino weighting and an alternate-variable template technique using 9.1 fb \u22121 corresponding to the full Run II data set. 59 The tt dilepton final state is reconstructed by minimizing a \u03c7 2 function to scan over the space of possibilities for the azimuthal angles of neutrinos. It yields a mass of m t = 170.80 \u00b1 1.83 (stat.) \u00b1 2.69 (sys.) GeV. The most precise CDF measurement employs 8.7 fb \u22121 in the \u2113+jets decay chan-  Figure 15(b) shows the m t versus m W plane with the best measurements of m t (Tevatron combination) and m W (world average). Together with the measurement of the mass of the recently discovered Higgs boson 62,63 this is a strong selfconsistency test of the SM. Figure 15(c) shows regions of absolute stability, metastability and instability of the SM vacuum in the m t -m H plane in the region of the preferred experimental range of m H and m t where the gray areas denote the allowed region at significances of one, two, and three standard deviations. 65 The current measurements and the theoretical extrapolation seem to indicate that the vacuum is meta-stable or, maybe even more peculiar, sitting right at the boundary of stability and meta-stability.",

More information about other Tevatron top quark measurements not discussed here can be found in Refs. 5,6 Exciting new results were recently presented by the Tevatron experiments: the observation of s-channel single top quark production, which is very hard to measure in LHC conditions and a variety of measurements targeted at the still puzzling situation observed in measurements of asymmetries in the top quark sector. Additonal information on this situation is provided by precise measurements of differential cross section distributions. In case of D\u00d8 measurements it should be noted that a variety of measurements are currently updated to the full Run II data set and results are expected very soon. This includes measurements of the top quark mass, where together with additional studies on systematic uncertainties a significant improvement of the experimental uncertainties is expected. The Tevatron continues to provide exciting measurements, which are competitive and complementary to measurements at the LHC. The combination of CDF and D\u00d8 measurements is part of the legacy of the Tevatron, which is being written right now and will stay for a long time in the text books.",

The template fit is carried out in sub-samples characterized by the number of b-tagged jets. The measurement yields m t = 172.85 \u00b1 0.71 (stat. + JES) \u00b1 0.84 (sys.) GeV. CDF also measured the top quark mass in the all-jets decay channel 61 similarly employing the in-situ JES calibration as in case of the measurement in the \u2113+jets channel. The measurement yields a top quark mass of m t = 172.5 \u00b1 1.4 (stat.) \u00b1 1.0 (JES) \u00b1 1.1 (sys.) GeV. ",
