The resonant ALPs mass of the conversion is scanned by varying the X-ray injection angle to the crystal. No significant signals are observed, and 90% C.

These experiments mainly utilize an experimental technique referred to as \"Light-Shining-througha-Wall (LSW)\" [38]. LSW experiments convert real photons from an laboratory source into ALPs under an external magnetic field. Unconverted photons are blocked by an opaque wall, and then ALPs are reconverted into photons in a second magnetic field. The sensitivity to g a\u03b3\u03b3 is determined by the product of the magnetic field strength and length, which are typically O(1) T and O(1) m, respectively.

The previous experiments search only ALPs with a mass of up to \u223c40 eV [37] since the plasma frequency and the photon energy cannot be increased arbitrarily.

The atomic electric fields are as high as 10 11 V/m, which correspond to high magnetic fields of 10 3 T. The Primakoff effect within single crystals has been explored by B\u00fcchmuller and Hoogeveen [39], Liao [40], and Yamaji, et. al. [41].

            "text": "The detector position is aligned by using X rays reflected twice by the conversion system. Injected X rays can be reflected by Laue-case X-ray diffraction within the first blade under the Bragg condition. The reflected X rays are subsequently reflected by the second blade when the wall is opened. The X-ray beams reflected twice (RR beams) are almost coaxial to the signal X rays. The height difference between the RR beams and the signal X rays is an increasing function of \u2206\u03b8 (m a ), and the difference is 6 \u00b5m for ALPs with a mass of 1 keV. The X-ray beam profile is also estimated by measuring the diffraction efficiency of the RR beams as a function of \u2206\u03b8, which is referred to as the rocking curve. The diffraction efficiency of the RR beams depends on the deviation from the Bragg condition in the same way as the Laue-case conversion. Since the Bragg condition couples the X-ray injection angle and the X-ray photon energy, the energy-angular profile of injected X rays is equivalent to the one with no bandwidth and an effective angular profile, dF d\u03b8X , for X-ray diffraction and the Laue-case conversion, where F is the normalized profile of injected X rays and \u03b8 X is the effective angular deviation from the center of injected X rays. The rocking curve has a profile expanded by X-ray diffraction from dF d\u03b8X . The expected \u2206\u03b8 distribution of signal X rays has the same profile as dF d\u03b8X with a mean value corresponding to the ALP's mass. The signal-to-noise ratio also depends on dF d\u03b8X since environmental X rays within the energy window and a \u2206\u03b8 window shown later are indistinguishable from signal X rays.",

The scanning range is set to be from \u2206\u03b8 = 0 mrad to \u2206\u03b8 = 4.9 mrad, which corresponds to the resonant ALP's mass of m a < 1 keV. The data takings are performed four times with a scanning speed of 5.82, 5.66, 9.70, and 4.62 \u00b5rad/min. Two beam dumps take place during the third (at \u2206\u03b8=3.99 mrad) and the fourth (3.17 mrad) measurement. The overall data acquisition time is 47.2 hours. The fluctuation of X-ray intensity during the data takings is measured to be < 1.2% by the PIN photodiode within the wall. The goniometer angle drifts slowly due to the fluctuation of the room temperature. The drift angle, \u2206\u03b8 D , is estimated by rocking curves measured before and after the data takings. The drift angles of the four data takings are \u221215.7, \u22126.11, \u221210.8, and \u221212.9 \u00b5rad, respectively. The X-ray injection angle also temporally shifts during the drive of the stepping motor by \u2206\u03b8 DT = +3.49 \u00b5rad due to the distortion of a rotation coupler between the goniometer axis and the silicon crystal holder. Although these drifts are much smaller than the scanning range and do not affect the experimental sensitivity strongly, we take into account them in the signal integration procedure described later. Figure 4 (left) shows the energy-\u2206\u03b8 distribution of detected X rays in the vicinity of the energy window. The sparse distribution outside the energy window shows the contribution of environmental X rays independent of \u2206\u03b8. The number and the rate of detected X rays within the energy window are 94 photons and (0.554 \u00b1 0.057) \u00d7 10 \u22123 photons/s, respectively. The latter is consistent with the rate of the environmental X rays. The signal yield can be enhanced by integrating the detected X rays within a \u2206\u03b8 window due to the effective angular profile.

The largest uncertainties come from the estimation of L eff and the effect of X-ray heat load. Minor X-ray diffraction on lattice planes other than Si(220) takes place during the scanning at \u2206\u03b8 = 3.67 mrad. The X-ray diffraction reduces the X-ray attenuation length at \u2206\u03b8 >\u223c 3.67 mrad. The sensitivity to g a\u03b3\u03b3 is reduced by 3.7% at 3.40 mrad < \u2206\u03b8 < 3.84 mrad and 1.4% at 3.84 mrad < \u2206\u03b8 < 4.9 mrad, where these values are estimated by the monitored X-ray intensity. The X-ray heat load on the first blade (\u223c 41.5 mW) reduces the Bragg angle at the conversion by expanding the crystal lattice. The effect on the Bragg angle is evaluated by a finite-element-method simulation code, ANSYS [46]. The simulation ignores heat conduction via the atmosphere and assumes the X-ray beam profile to be rectangular with the same widths as the FWHM of injected X rays. These approximations overestimate the effect of the X-ray heat load. The shift of the Bragg angle is estimated to be < 97.3 nrad, which reduces the reconversion efficiency and the sensitivity to g a\u03b3\u03b3 by < 17.4% and < 4.4%, respectively.",
