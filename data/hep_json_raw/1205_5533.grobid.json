In both these cases the photon is accompanied by jet fragments so that observing photons isolated from jets enhances the contribution from the fundamental 2-to-2 subprocesses. Naturally, all these effects must be taken into account in theoretical calculations of direct photon production in pQCD, and such calculations [4] are generally in excellent agreement with all previous measurements, including those from PHENIX [5]. However, decreasing the uncertainties of both measurement and theory and extending the range to larger p T is desirable. Measurements with and without an isolation criterion allow more specific comparisons of theoretical models and a better understanding of photons coming from bremsstrahlung and parton fragmentation.",

Each arm is divided into 4 sectors in azimuth. All 4 sectors in the West arm are lead scintillator sampling detectors (PbSc). In the East arm, 2 sectors are PbSc and 2 sectors are lead glass\u010cerenkov detectors (PbGl). The sectors are composed of independent towers with granularities of \u2206\u03b7 \u00d7 \u2206\u03c6 = 0.011 \u00d7 0.011 and 0.008 \u00d7 0.008 for the PbSc and the PbGl, respectively. Photon clusters are composed from the sum of energy deposits in a center tower and adjacent towers. The transverse containment in a single tower hit near the center is \u223c 80%. During data taking, the relative gain of the detectors was monitored using a light pulser calibration system. The absolute energy calibration was based on the known minimum-ionizing energy peak of charged tracks, energy-momentum matching of identified electron tracks and the measured value of the \u03c0 0 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 invariant mass. The linearity of the energy response was obtained from beam tests and the dependence of the measured \u03c0 0 mass on its momentum. The energy resolution was determined using the width of the \u03c0 0 peak, and was \u03c3 E /E = 8.1%/ \u221a E(GeV) \u2295 5.7%. The systematic error on the absolute energy scale is less than 1.5%.

The drift chambers (DC) and the innermost layer of the pad chambers (PC1) provide charged track information and were used to veto charged hadron clusters in the EMCal.

            "text": "In the obtained photon sample the majority of the background for direct photon measurements comes from decays of hadrons, primarily \u03c0 0 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 (\u223c 80%) and \u03b7 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 (\u223c 15%). The contribution from \u03c0 0 decays was evaluated by a \u03c0 0 -tagging method 2 . In this approach the direct photon candidate was paired with each of the other photons in an event (a partner photon) to calculate the two-photon invariant mass M \u03b3\u03b3 , which was required to be in the range from 105 to 165 MeV corresponding to \u00b13\u03c3 around the \u03c0 0 peak (see Fig. 1). Both photons were required to have a minimum energy E min = 0.5 GeV. The combinatorial background under the \u03c0 0 peak was evaluated and then subtracted by fitting the two-photon invariant mass distribution outside the peak region. The corrections for the underestimation due to photon conversions and \u03c0 0 Dalitz decays were applied as a part of the partner photon efficiency. To avoid acceptance losses for \u03c0 0 reconstruction, the edge areas of the EMCal outside the fiducial region were included for partner photon selection as long as the primary photon was in the fiducial region. The minimum photon energy cut, the EMCal geometry, and inactive areas led to an underestimate of the \u03c0 0 decay photon yields. A correction for this was calculated using a single particle Monte Carlo simulation, which included the EMCal geometry, the configuration of dead areas, resolution, and the \u03c0 0 spectrum shape from earlier measurements [8]. Figure 2 shows a p T dependent multiplicative correction, denoted as 1 + R, to the tagged \u03c0 0 photon sample. 1+R drops with increasing p T when going from 5 GeV/c to 15 GeV/c due to the decreasing influence of the E min cut. As the p T increases further the correction stops decreasing due to an increasing merging probability. The correction for asymmetric decays is more affected by the E min cut, since symmetric decays start merging and are rejected from the photon sample by the shower shape cut. Completely merged photons from high p T \u03c0 0 decays may resemble single photons in the EMCal; this residual contribution is corrected later.",

Figure 12 shows the ratio of both the direct photon signal and photons from \u03c0 0 to the fit. The dotted line in the figure is at 2/(8.22 \u2212 1) = 0.277, which is the analytic expectation for the ratio of \u03c0 0 decay photons to \u03c0 0 in case of a pure power law behavior of the \u03c0 0 . The fraction of the direct photon contribution gets higher as the transverse momentum increases. The contribution of photons from \u03c0 0 s deviates from the analytic expectation at higher p T because most of the merged clusters are rejected from the photon sample. The data are systematically lower than the analytical line even at the lowest p T . But as shown in Fig.11, the systematic uncertainty of the fit constant is on the order of 10%. If this uncertainty is taken into account, the agreement is reasonable. Figure 13 shows the ratio of isolated-direct photons to inclusive-direct photons, and isolated over inclusive photons from \u03c0 0 s. Since the background subtractions are done independently, this ratio can exceed unity due to the uncertainty. The data are compared to two theoretical calculations, which include the same isolation criteria. The cone size of the isolation cut is larger than the area within the PHENIX central arm acceptance around the isolated photon candidate and leads to an underestimate of the energy in the cone. This effect was not corrected for; instead the same acceptance was included in the theory calculation. However the theory calculation assumes no dead areas in the acceptance. The theory calculation varies at most by 2% (90% \u2192 92%), when the effect of the dead area is included.",

            "text": "The isolation cut causes a large suppression of photons from \u03c0 0 . This is expected as the \u03c0 0 is accompanied with other fragmentation products. At high p T (p T >\u223c 10 GeV/c), the ratio of isolated direct photon to inclusive-direct photons is typically more than 90% and matches the expectation from NLO pQCD calculations. At low p T , the data are below the theory calculation, although generally they agree within the systematic uncertainty. Explanations of possible discrepancy were thought to be underlying event activity as well as the contribution of photons from quark fragmentation, which are not considered in the theory calculation. However a study with an event generator (pythia tune A [22]) did not show any drop in the low p T region for the direct photons, while the level of isolated photons from \u03c0 0 decays was well reproduced V. DISCUSSION Figure 10 shows good agreement between the data and NLO pQCD calculations. While the calculations at low p T seem low, the correlated systematic uncertainties in the data are such that the difference is not significant. Figure 14 compiles this data and other measurements of direct photons in p+p or p +p collisions from both collider and fixed target experiments, over a broad range of collision energy. Note that most of the collider data except for that of PHENIX apply an isolation cut in their photon selection as listed in Table I. Also note that the PHENIX measurement [32] having the lowest p T points uses the virtual-photon method. The cross sections are shown as a function of of x T = 2p T / \u221a s and scaled by the empirical value of \u221a s n eff with n eff = 4.5 (Eq. 9). The effective power, n eff , is primarily sensitive to the quantum exchange governing the reaction but also has sensitivity to scalebreaking. For measurements of single particle or single jet inclusive p T distributions, this x T scaling [45,46] provides a data driven test of whether pQCD or some other underlying subprocess is at work, as well as providing a compact quantitative way to describe the data using the effective index, The filled circles (\u03b3 dir /\u03c0 0 ): the ratio of the direct photon cross section to the \u03c0 0 cross section fit. The crosses (\u03b3 \u03c0 0 /\u03c0 0 ): the ratio of the background photon from \u03c0 0 decay to the \u03c0 0 cross section fit. The \u03c0 0 cross section used for the denominator is the fit curve explained in the text and shown in Fig. 11. The dotted line shows the analytical expectation of \u03b3 \u03c0 0 /\u03c0 0 . See the text for details. The systematic uncertainty on the \u03c0 0 photon contribution includes acceptance, smearing, \u03c0 0 photon counting, and untagged \u03c0 0 photon probability.

The isolation cut enhances the g +q \u2192 \u03b3 +q contribution and suppresses a possible background of single photons from bremsstrahlung or jet fragmentation. The main utility of the isolation cut is that  [19] and one scale for the GRV [21] parton to photon fragmentation functions. Open circles: Ratio of isolated photons from \u03c0 0 decays to all photons from \u03c0 0 decays. it reduces the background of photons from hadronic decays by a significant factor of \u223c 60%. Furthermore, the data are an important reference for interpreting direct-photon spectra in heavy-ion collisions.       VI: Systematic uncertainties of inclusive-direct photon measurement. The percentage uncertainties of each component is shown: (A) the global factor (quadrature sum of components A1, A2, and A3), (B) inclusive photon counts, (C) \u03c0 0 tagging, (D) the factor for the total \u03c0 0 counts, and (E) the factor for the hadron contribution other than \u03c0 0 ) and the contribution to the direct photon signal (A*1, B*W, C*(W-1), D*(W-1), E*(W-1)).
