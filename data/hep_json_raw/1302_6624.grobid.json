In this contribution the results for identified pions, kaons and protons in heavy-ion collisions at 2.76 TeV center-of-mass energy are presented. These results are compared with other identified particle measurements obtained by previous experiments, and discussed in terms of the thermal and hydrodynamic pictures. The status of extensions of this analysis, with the study of identified particles as a function of event-by-event flow in Pb-Pb collisions, is also discussed.",

The fraction of primaries in the track sample at a given p T bin was estimated from data by fitting the DCA xy distribution with three Monte Carlo templates: primary particles, secondaries from material and secondaries from weak decays [3]. A detailed description of the systematic error and PID procedure can be found in [4]. Spectra measured at the LHC are compared with RHIC results for Au-Au collisions at \u221a s NN = 200 GeV (black-empty markers). The spectral shape is significantly harder at the LHC with respect to RHIC. The kinetic freezeout parameters \u03b2 T and T kin can be extracted from a simultaneous blast wave fit to the \u03c0, K and p spectra. The p T ranges used in the fit are 0.5-1 GeV/c, 0.2-1.5 GeV/c, 0.3-3 GeV/c for \u03c0, K and p. Data are well described by the blast wave function with \u03b2 T = 0.65 \u00b1 0.02 and T kin = 95 \u00b1 10 MeV. It should be noted that T kin is sensitive to the pion fit range (due to large contribution from resonances) while \u03b2 T does not strongly depend on the p T range used in the fit. A similar fit to central Au-Au collisions at \u221a s NN = 200 GeV was performed in [5]: the \u03b2 T is \u223c 10% larger at the LHC with respect to RHIC and T kin is compatible within errors. The comparison with predictions (see [4] for details) seems to suggest that hydrodynamic models with a refined late fireball description are able to reproduce the measured p T spectra at the LHC. In order to further investigate the hydrodynamic behaviour of the hadron production two of the main features of hydrodynamics were correlated: p T distribution of hadrons and elliptic flow. For a given centrality the eccentricity of the collision (related with the initial geometry) fluctuates. A strategy to select events based on the geometry of the overlapping region (so called \"event shape engineering\") was presented for the first time during this conference in [6,7]. One way to do this is using the VZERO detector to calculate the flow vector Q 2 on an event-by-event basis, a 2D vector with components Q 2,x = i w i cos(2\u03c6 i ) and Q 2,y = i w i sin(2\u03c6 i ), where the sum i runs over all the channels of the VZERO detector, w i is the multiplicity of channel i and \u03c6 i is the angle of channel i. The module of the Q 2 vector is normalized by the multiplicity M in the VZERO: (from \u223c 1 up to \u223c 5 GeV/c) is observed, when events are selected according to the event shape engineering (Figure 1, right): higher (lower) v 2 means harder (softer) spectra. This modification vanishes at high p T supporting a correlation related with hydrodynamics rather than with hard processes. A hint of mass ordering can be observed in the region between \u223c 1 up to \u223c 3 GeV/c. A more detailed study (including comparison with models and hydrodynamic fit of particle spectra) will allow to better understand the observed correlation between v 2 and radial flow.",

There are only these three parameters which govern the thermal model: the chemical freezeout temperature T ch , the baryonchemical potential \u00b5 B and the volume V. In order to extract the parameters T ch , \u00b5 B and V a thermal fit [8]   The temperature extracted from the fit T ch = 152 \u00b1 3 MeV is lower with respect to the temperature one would expect considering T ch constant above SPS energies (164 MeV). From Figure 2 (left) it is possible to see some tension between the data and the fit especially for strange and multi-strange particles. This is reflected also in the large value of the \u03c7 2 /N d. f. = 39.6/9. The comparison of integrated yields relative to pions (Figure 2, right) with RHIC hints to decreasing ratios at the LHC, especially for what concerns p/\u03c0 and \u039b/\u03c0. The prediction from the thermal model is reported with two different values of the freezeout temperature: T ch = 164 MeV (value obtained from fit to RHIC data) and T ch = 152 MeV (from the fit described above). T ch = 164 MeV seems to reproduce the multi-strange ratios quite well, but some discrepancy is observed for p/\u03c0 and \u039b/\u03c0. On the other hand the model prediction using T ch = 152 MeV obtained from the fit is closer to the measured p/\u03c0 and \u039b/\u03c0 ratios but it misses ratios involving multi-strange hadrons. It has already been pointed out that interactions in the hadronic phase, in particular via the large cross section channel for antibaryon-baryon annihilation, could explain the significant deviation from the usual thermal ratios [11,12].",
