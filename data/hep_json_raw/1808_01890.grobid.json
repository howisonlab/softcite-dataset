            "text": "A search for resonances in the mass range 12-70 GeV produced in association with a b quark jet and a second jet, and decaying to a muon pair, is reported. The analysis is based on data from proton-proton collisions at center-of-mass energies of 8 and 13 TeV, collected with the CMS detector at the LHC and corresponding to integrated luminosities of 19.7 and 35.9 fb \u22121 , respectively. The search is carried out in two mutually exclusive event categories. Events in the first category are required to have a b quark jet in the central region ( \u03b7 \u2264 2.4) and at least one jet in the forward region ( \u03b7 > 2.4). Events in the second category are required to have two jets in the central region, at least one of which is identified as a b quark jet, no jets in the forward region, and low missing transverse momentum. An excess of events above the background near a dimuon mass of 28 GeV is observed in the 8 TeV data, corresponding to local significances of 4.2 and 2.9 standard deviations for the first and second event categories, respectively. A similar analysis conducted with the 13 TeV data results in a mild excess over the background in the first event category corresponding to a local significance of 2.0 standard deviations, while the second category results in a 1.4 standard deviation deficit. The fiducial cross section measurements and 95% confidence level upper limits on those for a resonance consistent with the 8 TeV excess are provided at both collision energies.",

            "text": "The discovery of a Higgs boson [1][2][3] with a mass near 125 GeV [4,5] provided new motivation to search for an extended Higgs sector at the CERN LHC. These searches are focused not only on additional Higgs bosons at high mass, but also on possible light states below 125 GeV, which may have eluded earlier detection. Light (pseudo)scalar bosons are predicted in a number of beyond the standard model (SM) theories, e.g., in two Higgs doublet models (2HDM) [6] and next-to-minimal supersymmetric SM (NMSSM) [7]. Despite an extensive program of searches for such resonances by the CERN LEP experiments [8][9][10][11][12], and by the ATLAS [13][14][15][16][17][18][19], CMS [20][21][22][23][24][25][26][27], and LHCb [28] Collaborations, the present experimental limits on the product of production cross sections and branching fractions do not yet exclude the existence of such particles [29].",

            "text": "As numerous searches for heavy particles at the LHC have thus far produced only null results, searches for low-mass resonances with suppressed couplings to SM particles have received increased interest. Examples include extending dijet resonance searches to low masses [30][31][32][33], and searches for dark photons and dark Z bosons [16,34,35]. Such lowmass resonances are predicted in a number of models, including those [36,37] providing possible explanations for the host of recently observed flavor anomalies [38,39] via Z bosons with nonuniversal couplings to quarks and leptons. The cross section of the associated production with bottom quarks of a new light boson (scalar or vector), times the dimuon branching fraction of its decay, can be large in proton-proton (pp) collisions at the LHC, e.g., in 2HDM [40] or in Z [36] models. Previous searches in this channel were performed by CMS using \u221a s = 7 and 8 TeV data [21,27]. In the course of detailed studies related to a search [27] for a (pseudo)scalar boson produced in association with bottom quarks and decaying into opposite-sign (OS) muon",

The excess is vanishing in the published analysis [27], being diluted by much more inclusive selections applied to data. As a cross-check, a complementary sample of events with two OS muons, a central b jet, an additional central jet, no forward jets, and low missing transverse momentum was studied. An excess of events above the SM background was observed also in this independent sample. Extensive studies related to various features of the observed excess and its possible origin did not reveal any significant systematic biases or problems with the background estimation methods or with the analysis technique. A similar analysis has now been performed using data collected in 2016 at \u221a s = 13 TeV. It results in a mild excess over the background in the first event category corresponding to a local significance of 2.0 standard deviations (s.d.), while the second category results in a 1.4 s.d. deficit. This paper describes in detail both the 8 and 13 TeV analyses, corresponding to integrated luminosities of 19.7 and 35.9 fb \u22121 , respectively, and is organized as follows. The CMS detector is briefly described in section 2. Data and simulated samples, as well as the event reconstruction, are presented in section 3. The event selection is described in section 4, followed by a statistical characterization of the observed dimuon mass distributions in section 5. Results are summarized in section 6.",

The energy of muons is obtained from the curvature of the corresponding track. The energy of photons is directly obtained from the ECAL measurement. The energy of electrons is determined from a combination of the electron momentum at the primary interaction vertex, as determined by the tracker, the energy of the corresponding ECAL cluster, and the energy sum of all bremsstrahlung photons spatially compatible with originating from the electron track. The energy of charged hadrons is determined from a combination of their momentum measured in the tracker and the matching ECAL and HCAL energy deposits, corrected for zero-suppression effects and for the response function of the calorimeters to hadronic showers. Finally, the energy of neutral hadrons is obtained from the corresponding corrected ECAL and HCAL energy. The missing transverse momentum vector in the event p miss T is defined as a negative vectorial sum of the p T of all PF candidates in an event; its magnitude is referred to as p miss T . For each event, hadronic jets are clustered from PF candidates using the infraredand collinear-safe anti-k T algorithm [44] with a distance parameter of 0.5 (0.4) for the 8 (13) TeV analysis, as implemented in the FastJet package [45]. The jet momentum is determined as the vectorial sum of all particle momenta in the jet, and is found from simulation to be within 5 to 10% of the true momentum over the entire p T spectrum and detector acceptance. Additional pp interactions within the same or nearby bunch crossings (pileup) can contribute additional tracks and calorimetric energy depositions to the jet momentum. To mitigate this effect, tracks identified to be originating from pileup vertices are discarded and an offset correction [46] is applied to correct for remaining contributions. Jet energy corrections are derived from simulation to bring the measured response of jets to that of particle-level jets on average. In situ measurements of the momentum balance in dijet, multijet, photon+jet, and leptonically decaying Z+jet events are used to account for any residual differences between the jet energy scales in data and simulation [47]. The jet energy resolution amounts typically to 15% at 10 GeV, 8% at 100 GeV, and 4% at 1 TeV. Additional selection criteria are applied to remove jets potentially dominated by anomalous contributions from various subdetector components or reconstruction failures [48]. Jets identified as likely coming from pileup [49] are also removed.",

Also shown in the plot are the expected cross sections and their uncertainties at \u221a s = 13 TeV, which were obtained by scaling the measured 8 TeV cross sections by a factor of 1.5 or 2.5, indicative of an expected cross section increase from \u221a s = 8 to 13 TeV for the qq or gg production mechanism, respectively, for the invariant mass of the produced system in the mass range between 30 GeV and the top quark mass [76,77]. The choice of the lower edge of this range is motivated by the measured mass of a hypothetical dimuon resonance. The upper edge was taken assuming that a hypothetical resonance could be produced in a top quark decay. In the absence of a realistic signal model, both the mass range and the scaling should be considered only as simple benchmarks; in particular, the scaling does not take into account possible changes in the signal acceptance between the two collision energies; hence we can not exclude that the signal kinematics seen with the 8 TeV selections are disfavored in 13 TeV data.

The search is carried out in two mutually exclusive event categories. Events in the first category are required to have a b quark jet in the central region (|\u03b7| \u2264 2.4) and at least one jet in the forward region (|\u03b7| > 2.4). Events in the second category are required to have two jets in the central region, at least one of which is identified as a b quark jet, no jets in the forward region, and low missing transverse momentum. An excess of events above the background near a dimuon mass of 28 GeV is observed in both event categories in the 8 TeV data, corresponding to local significances of 4.2 and 2.9 standard deviations, respectively.",
