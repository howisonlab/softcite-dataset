            "text": "Heavy-quarks, i.e. charm and beauty, are mainly produced in hard scattering processes in the early stages of high energy nucleus-nucleus collisions and they experience the full evolution of the medium formed in such collisions, the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). Therefore, heavy-flavour hadrons are well suited probes to investigate the properties of the medium. Due to their large masses, charm and beauty quarks are expected to lose less energy than light quarks and gluons when traversing the medium due to the dead-cone effect [1] and also to have a longer relaxation time [2]. In this contribution we present the measurement of elliptic flow v 2 of electrons from the semi-leptonic decays of heavy-flavour hadrons in semi-central (20-40% centrality) Pb-Pb collisions at \u221a s NN = 2.76 TeV with ALICE. The elliptic flow is the second Fourier coefficient of the azimuthal distribution of particle momenta in the transverse plane with respect to the reaction plane. At low p T , the v 2 of the electrons from heavy-flavour hadron decays is sensitive to the degree of thermalization of charm and beauty quarks in the deconfined medium. At higher p T , the measurement of v 2 carries information on the path length dependence of inmedium parton energy loss. The analysis was carried out with different methods that have different sensitivity to non-flow contributions, namely event plane [3], scalar product [4] and Q-Cumulants [5]. We compare the experimental result to several theoretical models and with measurements from Au-Au collisions at \u221a s NN = 0.2 TeV at RHIC [7].",

Electron candidates are selected and identified using different approaches. In the low p T region (p T < 6 GeV/c) information from the TPC (Time Projection Chamber) and the TOF (Time Of Flight) detectors is used, while the EMCal contributes to electron identification for 1.5 < p T < 13 GeV/c. Particle identification in the TPC is based on the measurement of the specific energy loss dE/dx in the detector gas, while in the TOF the charged particles are separated via the measurement of their time of flight from the interaction point to the detector. Electron identification in the EMCal is based on the measurement of the E/p ratio, where E is the energy of the EMCal cluster that was matched to the prolongation of the track with momentum p reconstructed in the TPC and ITS detectors. Electrons deposit their total energy in the EMCal and due to their small mass the E/p ratio should be equal to unity. The sample of identified electron candidates is mainly composed of two distinct sources: electrons from the semi-leptonic decays of hadrons containing a charm or beauty quark, and photonic electrons, originating mainly from Dalitz decays of \u03c0 0 and \u03b7 mesons and from photon conversion. In order to extract the heavy-flavour signal, the background contributions have to be subtracted from the inclusive electron spectra and v 2 . In this analysis this task is accomplished using two different methods. In the first method a cocktail of electron spectra from background sources is calculated using a Monte Carlo event generator of hadron decays [6]. In the second method the electron background is reconstructed using the invariant mass method. The latter makes use of the fact that an electron from a photonic source is always accompanied by a positron, forming an electron-positron pair with small invariant mass. In the current analysis pairs with a mass below 70 MeV/c 2 are tagged as photonic.",

We observe positive v 2 at low p T in semi-central collisions. The positive v 2 has a contribution from heavy-quark collective flow at low p T and may be due to the path-length dependence of the energy loss mechanism. In Fig. 4 the experimental results are compared with measurements by PHENIX in Au-Au collisions at RHIC at \u221a s NN = 0.2 TeV [7] and with various transport model calculations. The v 2 measured at the LHC is similar in magnitude to that measured by PHENIX at lower collision energy. The model calculations shown in Fig.  4 incorporate parton transport based on the Boltzmann approach that includes the coupling of the quarks with an expanding medium via collisional and radiative processes (BAMPS) [9]; heavy-quarks transport with in-medium resonance scattering and coalescence (Rapp et. al) [10]; and heavy-quarks transport (Langevin equation) with collisional energy loss (POWLANG) [11].",
