            "text": "A search for pair production of vector-like quarks, both up-type (T ) and downtype (B), as well as for four-top-quark production, is presented. The search is based on pp collisions at \u221a s = 8 TeV recorded in 2012 with the ATLAS detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb \u22121 . Data are analysed in the lepton-plus-jets final state, characterised by an isolated electron or muon with high transverse momentum, large missing transverse momentum and multiple jets. Dedicated analyses are performed targeting three cases: a T quark with significant branching ratio to a W boson and a b-quark (TT \u2192 W b+X), and both a T quark and a B quark with significant branching ratio to a Higgs boson and a third-generation quark (TT \u2192 Ht+X and BB \u2192 Hb+X respectively). No significant excess of events above the Standard Model expectation is observed, and 95% CL lower limits are derived on the masses of the vector-like T and B quarks under several branching ratio hypotheses assuming contributions from T \u2192 W b, Zt, Ht and B \u2192 W t, Zb, Hb decays. The 95% CL observed lower limits on the T quark mass range between 715 GeV and 950 GeV for all possible values of the branching ratios into the three decay modes, and are the most stringent constraints to date. Additionally, the most restrictive upper bounds on four-top-quark production are set in a number of new physics scenarios.",

            "text": "The discovery of a new particle consistent with the Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson by the ATLAS [1] and CMS [2] collaborations is a major milestone in high-energy physics. However, the underlying nature of electroweak symmetry breaking remains unknown. Naturalness arguments [3] require that quadratic divergences that arise from radiative corrections to the Higgs boson mass must be cancelled by some new mechanism in order to avoid fine-tuning. To that effect, several explanations have been proposed in theories beyond the SM (BSM). In supersymmetry, the cancellation comes from assigning superpartners to the SM bosons and fermions. Alternatively, Little Higgs [4,5] and Composite Higgs [6,7] models introduce a spontaneously broken global symmetry, with the Higgs boson emerging as a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson [8]. Such models predict the existence of vectorlike quarks, defined as colour-triplet spin-1/2 fermions whose left-and right-handed chiral components have the same transformation properties under the weak-isospin SU(2) gauge group [9,10]. In these models vector-like quarks are expected to couple preferentially to third-generation quarks [9,11] and they can have flavour-changing neutral current decays, in addition to the charged-current decays characteristic of chiral quarks. As a result, an up-type quark T with charge +2/3 can decay not only to a W boson and a b-quark, but also to a Higgs or Z boson and a top quark (T \u2192 W b, Zt, and Ht). Similarly, a down-type quark B with charge \u22121/3 can decay to a Higgs or Z boson and a b-quark, in addition to decaying to a W boson and a top quark (B \u2192 W t, Zb, and Hb). In order to be consistent with the results from the precision electroweak measurements, a small mass splitting between vector-like quarks belonging to the same SU(2) multiplet is required [12], which forbids cascade decays such as T \u2192 W B and leaves direct decays into SM particles as the only possibility. Couplings between the vector-like quarks and the first and second quark generations, although not favoured, are not excluded [13,14]. This leads to a rich phenomenology at the LHC, which the experiments are investigating.",

The inner detector provides tracking information from silicon pixel and microstrip detectors in the pseudorapidity 2 range |\u03b7| < 2.5 and from a straw-tube transition radiation tracker covering |\u03b7| < 2.0, all immersed in a 2 T axial magnetic field provided by a superconducting solenoid. The electromagnetic (EM) sampling calorimeter uses lead as the absorber material and liquid-argon (LAr) as the active medium, and is divided into barrel (|\u03b7| < 1.475) and end-cap (1.375 < |\u03b7| < 3.2) regions. Hadron calorimetry is also based on the sampling technique, with either scintillator tiles or LAr as the active medium, and with steel, copper, or tungsten as the absorber material. The calorimeters cover |\u03b7| < 4.9. The muon spectrometer measures the deflection of muons with |\u03b7| < 2.7 using multiple layers of high-precision tracking chambers located in a toroidal field of approximately 0.5 T and 1 T in the central and end-cap regions of ATLAS, respectively. The muon spectrometer is also instrumented with separate trigger chambers covering |\u03b7| < 2.4. A three-level trigger system [44] is used to select interesting events. The first-level trigger is implemented in custom electronics and uses a subset of detector information to reduce the event rate to at most 75 kHz. This is followed by two software-based trigger levels exploiting the full detector information and yielding a typical recorded event rate of 400 Hz during 2012.",

Only events recorded with a single-electron or singlemuon trigger under stable beam conditions and for which all detector subsystems were operational are considered. The corresponding integrated luminosity is 20.3 \u00b1 0.6 fb \u22121 [57]. Single-lepton triggers with different p T thresholds are combined in a logical OR in order to increase the overall efficiency. The p T thresholds are 24 or 60 GeV for the electron triggers and 24 or 36 GeV for the muon triggers. The triggers with the lower p T threshold include isolation requirements on the candidate lepton, resulting in inefficiencies at high p T that are recovered by the triggers with higher p T threshold. Events satisfying the trigger selection are required to have at least one reconstructed vertex with at least five associated tracks with p T > 400 MeV, consistent with originating from the beam collision region in the x-y plane. The average number of pp interactions per bunch crossing is approximately 20, resulting in several vertices reconstructed per event. If more than one vertex is found, the hard-scatter primary vertex is taken to be the one which has the largest sum of the squared transverse momenta of its associated tracks. For the event topologies considered",

For higher masses, single production mediated by the electroweak interaction can potentially dominate, depending on the strength of the interaction between the new quarks and the weak gauge bosons. The predicted pair-production cross section ranges from 5.3 pb for a quark mass of 350 GeV to 3.3 fb for a quark mass of 1000 GeV, with an uncertainty that increases from 8% to 14% over this mass range. This cross section is independent of the electroweak quantum numbers of the new heavy quark and just depends on its mass. It was computed using Top++ v2.0 [58] at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in QCD, including resummation of next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic (NNLL) soft gluon terms [59][60][61][62][63], and using the MSTW 2008 NNLO [64,65] set of parton distribution functions (PDF). Theoretical uncertainties result from variations on the factorisation and renormalisation scales, as well as from uncertainties on the PDF and \u03b1 S . The latter two represent the largest contribution to the overall theoretical uncertainty on the cross section and were calculated using the PDF4LHC prescription [66] with the MSTW 2008 68% CL NNLO, CT10 NNLO [67,68] and NNPDF2.3 5f FFN [69] PDF sets.",

Four-top-quark production can arise from tier (1,1), where particles from this tier have to be pair produced because of symmetries of the model. Then they chain-decay to the lightest particle of this tier, the heavy photon A (1,1) , by emitting SM particles ( figure 3(d)). The branching ratios of A (1,1) into SM particles are not predicted by the model, although the decay into tt is expected to be dominant [40]. Four-top-quark events can also arise from tiers (2,0) and (0,2) via a similar mechanism. In this case the expected cross section for four-top-quark production is reduced compared to that from tier (1,1) since each state in tiers (2,0) and (0,2) can decay directly into a pair of SM particles or into a pair of states in tiers (1,0) or (0,1) via bulk",

The remaining events are labelled as tt+light-jet events, including those with no additional jets. In Powheg+Pythia the modelling of tt+HF is via the parton-shower evolution.

The stability of the ratio between \u221a s = 7 TeV and \u221a s = 8 TeV was studied to support the usage of \u221a s = 7 TeV data to correct the simulation at \u221a s = 8 TeV. This correction significantly improves agreement between simulation and data in distributions such as the jet multiplicity and the p T of decay products of the tt system. This correction is applied only to tt+light-jets and tt+cc events. The modelling of the tt+bb background, particularly important for the Ht/Hb+X searches, is improved by reweighting the Powheg+Pythia prediction to an NLO prediction of tt+bb including parton showering [95], based on Sherpa+OpenLoops [96,97] using the CT10 PDF set.

To avoid double-counting of partonic configurations generated by both the matrix-element calculation and the parton shower, a parton-jet matching scheme (\"MLM matching\") [100] is employed. The W +jets samples are generated separately for W +light-jets, W bb+jets, W cc+jets, and W c+jets. The Z+jets samples are generated separately for Z+light-jets, Zbb+jets, and Zcc+jets. Overlap between V QQ+jets (V = W, Z and Q = b, c) events generated from the matrix-element calculation and those generated from parton-shower evolution in the W/Z+light-jets samples is avoided via an algorithm based on the angular separation between the extra heavy quarks: if \u2206R(Q,Q) > 0.4, the matrix-element prediction is used, otherwise the parton-shower prediction is used. Both the W +jets and Z+jets background contributions are normalised to their inclusive NNLO theoretical cross sections [101]. Further corrections are applied to W/Z+jets events in order to better describe data in the preselected sample. Scale factors for each of the W +jets categories (W bb+jets, W cc+jets, W c+jets and W +light-jets) are derived for events with one lepton and at least four jets by simultaneously analysing six different event categories, defined by the b-tag multiplicity (0, 1 and \u22652) and the sign of the lepton charge. The b-tag multiplicity provides information about the heavy-flavour composition of the W +jets background, while the lepton charge is used to determine the normalisation of each component, exploiting the expected charge asymmetry for W +jets production in pp collisions as predicted by Alpgen. In the case of Z+jets events, a correction to the heavy-flavour fraction was derived to reproduce the relative rates of Z+2-jets events with zero and one b-tagged jets observed in data. In addition, the Z boson p T spectrum was compared between data and the simulation in Z+2-jets events, and a reweighting function was derived in order to improve the modelling.",

After the preselection described in section 4, further background suppression is achieved by applying requirements aimed at exploiting the distinct kinematic features of the signal. The large T quark mass results in energetic W bosons and b-quarks in the final state with large angular separation between them, while the decay products from the boosted W bosons have small angular separation.

Two selections, \"loose\" and \"tight\", are defined, with the latter being more restrictive than the former and representing the final selection. As discussed below, the loose selection is used to validate the background modelling in a kinematic regime close to the final selection. The loose selection considers preselected events with at least one W type I had or W type II had candidate. If multiple W had candidates are found in a given event, the one with the highest p T is chosen. Figure 4(a) shows the distribution of the number of W had candidates after preselection. The events must satisfy H T > 800 GeV, where H T is the scalar sum of the lepton p T , E miss T and the p T of the selected jets. The H T distribution peaks at \u223c2m T for signal events, which makes the H T > 800 GeV requirement particularly efficient for signal with m T 400 GeV, while rejecting a large fraction of the background. The tight selection adds further requirements that are particularly effective at suppressing tt background. First, a large angular separation between the W bosons and the b-jets from the top quark decay is required: min(\u2206R( , b 1,2 )) > 1. 4   reconstruction of the W lep candidate usually yields two solutions, and there are two possible ways to pair the b-jet candidates with the W boson candidates to form the heavy quarks. Among all possible combinations, the one yielding the smallest \u2206m is chosen. The main discriminating variable used in this search is the reconstructed heavy-quark mass (m reco ), built from the W had candidate and one of the two b-jet candidates. The resulting m reco distributions for the loose and tight selections are shown in figure 6 for the sum of W type I had and W type II had events. The tight selection has the better expected sensitivity, and only this selection is chosen to derive the final result of the search. The loose selection, displaying a significant tt background at low m reco which is in good agreement with the expectation, provides further confidence in the background modelling prior to the application of b-jet isolation requirements in the tight selection. Table 2 presents a summary of the background estimates for the loose and tight selections, as well as a comparison of the total predicted and observed yields. The quoted uncertainties include both the statistical and systematic contributions. The latter are discussed in section 10. The predicted and observed yields are in agreement within these uncertainties. 8 Search for TT \u2192 Ht+X and tttt production",

Figure 7(a) compares the jet multiplicity distribution after preselection (described in section 4) between the total background and several signal scenarios.

Figure 8(b) compares the H T distribution between signal and background for events with \u22656 jets and \u22654 b-tagged jets.

Figure 11(a) illustrates the good separation between signal and background in the H T distribution for events passing the preselection requirements and with \u2265 6 jets and \u2265 4 b-tagged jets. A peculiarity of the B \u2192 Hb decay mode is that the b-jet originating (directly) from the B-quark decay can have very high transverse momentum in the case of a heavy B quark. To exploit this feature, the event selection is tightened relative to that used in the TT \u2192 Ht+X search by raising the minimum p T requirement on the two highest-p T (leading) b-tagged jets to p T > 150 GeV. Figure 11(b) shows the distribution of the subleading b-jet p T for events passing the preselection requirements and with \u2265 6 jets and \u2265 4 b-tagged jets. The tighter requirement on the subleading b-jet p T rejects about 90% of the tt background while retaining a large acceptance for the BB \u2192 Hb+X signal. This search is also sensitive to other BB final states, such as BB \u2192 HbW t, that typically do not involve multilepton final states in the topologies usually searched for (opposite-sign dileptons with a Z \u2192 + \u2212 candidate, same-sign dileptons, and trileptons), and is thus complementary to previous searches [25][26][27]. Figures 12 and 13 show the comparison of data and prediction for the H T distributions in each of the analysis channels considered. The corresponding predicted and observed yields per channel can be found in table 4.

In all cases a mass of 600 GeV is assumed for the B quark.

The statistical analysis is based on a binned likelihood function L(\u00b5, \u03b8) constructed as a product of Poisson probability terms over all bins considered in the analysis. This function depends on the signal-strength parameter \u00b5, a multiplicative factor to the theoretical signal production cross section, and \u03b8, a set of nuisance parameters that encode the effect of systematic uncertainties on the signal and background expectations and are implemented in the likelihood function as Gaussian or log-normal priors. Therefore, the total number of expected events in a given bin depends on \u00b5 and \u03b8. The nuisance parameters \u03b8 allow variations of the expectations for signal and background according to the corresponding systematic uncertainties, and their fitted values correspond to the deviations from the nominal expectations that globally provide the best fit to the data. This procedure allows a reduction of the impact of systematic uncertainties on the search sensitivity by taking advantage of the highly populated background-dominated channels included in the likelihood fit. It requires a good understanding of the systematic effects affecting the shapes of the discriminant distributions. Detailed validation studies of the fitting procedure have been performed using the simulation. To verify the improved background prediction, fits are performed under the background-only hypothesis.

Statistical uncertainties in each bin of the discriminant distributions are also taken into account via dedicated parameters in the fit. The test statistic q \u00b5 is implemented in the RooFit package [126,127] and is used to measure the compatibility of the observed data with the background-only hypothesis (i.e. the discovery test) setting \u00b5 = 0 in the profile likelihood ratio: L(\u03bc,\u03b8)). The p-value (referred to as p 0 ) representing the compatibility of the data with the background-only hypothesis is estimated by integrating the distribution of q 0 from background-only pseudo-experiments, approximated using the asymptotic formulae given in ref. [128], above the observed value of q 0 . Some model dependence exists in the estimation of the p 0 -value, as a given signal scenario needs to be assumed in the calculation of the denominator of q \u00b5 , even if the overall signal normalisation is left floating and fitted to data. The observed p 0 -value is checked for each explored signal scenario. In the absence of any significant excess above the background expectation, upper limits on the signal production cross section for each of the signal scenarios considered are derived by using q \u00b5 in the CL s method [129,130].

A search in the lepton-plus-jets final state [26], referred to as BB \u2192 W t+X, and the search in same-sign dilepton and multilepton events [27], probe primarily the B \u2192 W t decay mode. The Zb/t+X search [25] is most sensitive to B \u2192 Zb production. Figure 25 summarises the most restrictive observed and expected B quark mass limits in the plane of BR(B \u2192 Hb) versus BR(B \u2192 W t), set by any of these searches. The observed lower limits on the B quark mass range between 575 GeV and 813 GeV for all possible values of the branching ratios into the three decay modes. The corresponding range of expected lower limits is between 615 GeV and 800 GeV. ",

The comparison to the LO theoretical cross section translates into an observed (expected) 95% CL limit on m KK of 1.12 TeV (1.10 TeV). Four-top-quark events can also arise from tiers (2,0) and (0,2). In those tiers the theoretical production cross sections can be calculated, leading to more robust results (i.e. there is no need to assume a particular branching ratio). The dependence of the tier kinematics on the tier mass also allows the extrapolation of constraints on tier (1,1) to tiers (2,0) and (0,2). Excluding a given production cross section for tier (1,1) at a given m KK is equivalent to excluding this production cross section for tier (2,0) alone at m KK / \u221a 2 and for tier (0,2) at m KK / \u221a 2\u03be. The contribution of tier (0,2) vanishes as \u03be increases (highly asymmetric case).

The TT \u2192 W b+X and TT \u2192 Ht+X searches yield observed (expected) 95% CL limits of m T > 660 (665) GeV and m T > 765 (720) GeV respectively. Figure 30 shows the 95% CL exclusion limits on vector-like T quark production, for different values of m T and as a function of the two branching ratios BR(T \u2192 W b) and BR(T \u2192 Ht), obtained by the TT \u2192 W b+X search. Figure 31(a,b) present the corresponding expected and observed T quark mass limits respectively, in the plane of BR(T \u2192 Ht) versus BR(T \u2192 W b). The exclusion limits obtained by the TT \u2192 Ht+X search can be found in figures 32 and 33. The TT \u2192 W b+X search sets observed (expected) lower limits on the T quark mass ranging between 350 GeV and 760 GeV (350 GeV and 800 GeV) for all possible values of the branching ratios into the three decay modes.
