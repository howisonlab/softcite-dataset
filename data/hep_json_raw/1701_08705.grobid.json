Such decays are highly suppressed in the Standard Model (SM), as the leading order amplitudes are described by loop diagrams and are also suppressed by the relevant Cabibbo-Kobayshi-Maskawa (CKM) factors. This suppression is not necessarily present in extensions to the SM, and such decays are therefore sensitive to contributions from new particles. One of the lowest-order diagrams for the decay \u039b 0 b \u2192 p\u03c0 \u2212 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 is shown in figure 1. The branching fraction of the decay 1 \u039b 0 b \u2192 p\u03c0 \u2212 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 is expected to be of O(10 \u22128 ). Together with the relevant form factors, a measurement of this branching fraction with respect to that of the analogous b \u2192 s transition \u039b 0 b \u2192 pK \u2212 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 , would allow the ratio of CKM elements |V td |/|V ts | to be determined. Comparing the value of |V td |/|V ts | from these processes with that measured via mixing processes would test the Minimal Flavour Violation hypothesis [1][2][3]. The decay, \u039b 0 b \u2192 pK \u2212 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 , has recently been observed for the first time by the LHCb collaboration [4].",

            "text": "The LHCb detector [8,9] is a single-arm forward spectrometer covering the pseudorapidity range 2 < \u03b7 < 5, designed for the study of particles containing b or c quarks. The detector includes a high-precision tracking system consisting of a silicon-strip vertex detector surrounding the pp interaction region, a large-area silicon-strip detector located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4 Tm, and three stations of silicon-strip detectors and straw drift tubes placed downstream of the magnet. The tracking system provides a measurement of momentum, p, of charged particles with a relative uncertainty that varies from 0.5% at low momentum to 1.0% at 200 GeV/c. The minimum distance of a track to a primary vertex (PV), the impact parameter, is measured with a resolution of (15 + 29/p T ) \u00b5m, where p T is the component of the momentum transverse to the beam, in GeV/c. Different types of charged hadrons are distinguished using information from two Ring-Imaging Cherenkov (RICH) detectors. Photons, electrons and hadrons are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter and a hadronic calorimeter. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers. The online event selection is performed by a trigger [10], which consists of a hardware stage, based on information from the calorimeter and muon systems, followed by a software stage, which applies a full event reconstruction. Simulated events are used to optimise selection criteria and calculate the relative efficiency between the signal and normalisation channels. In the simulation, pp collisions are generated using Pythia [11,12] with a specific LHCb configuration [13]. Decays of hadronic particles are described by EvtGen [14], in which final-state radiation is generated using Photos [15]. The interaction of the generated particles with the detector, and its response, are implemented using the Geant4 toolkit [16,17], as described in ref. [18].",

In order to reject background containing additional tracks in close proximity to the \u039b 0 b vertex, an isolation parameter [22] is also used as an input variable. As the presence of a proton from a displaced vertex is a distinctive signature, PID information on the proton candidate is used in the BDT in order to improve the rejection of background.

For example, the PID efficiencies are obtained from data samples with decays where the final-state particles can be identified by kinematic constraints alone [24]. Further corrections are derived by comparing the data and simulation distributions of the \u039b 0 b momentum, transverse momentum, decay time and the track multiplicity for the normalisation channel. The relative efficiency of the BDT is calculated using both \u039b 0 b \u2192 J/\u03c8 pK \u2212 and \u039b 0 b \u2192 pK \u2212 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 candidates selected from the data; the resulting efficiencies are consistent with each other. The most important difference in the efficiency between the signal and normalisation modes is due to the q 2 selection for the signal decay, which removes 30% of the signal candidates. For the full selection, including the dimuon mass vetoes, the total relative efficiency is found to be \u03b5(\u039b 0 b \u2192 p\u03c0 \u2212 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 )/\u03b5(\u039b 0 b \u2192 J/\u03c8 p\u03c0 \u2212 ) = 0.487 \u00b1 0.022. For the normalisation channel, candidates are required to have a dimuon mass within 60 MeV/c 2 of the known J/\u03c8 mass. The yield of the normalisation channel is obtained by performing an extended unbinned maximum likelihood fit to the \u039b 0 b \u2192 J/\u03c8 p\u03c0 \u2212 mass distribution, as shown in figure 2. The shape of the \u039b 0 b \u2192 J/\u03c8 p\u03c0 \u2212 mass distribution is described by the sum of two Gaussian functions with power law tails and a shared mean, where the Gaussian parameters are allowed to vary in the fit and the tail parameters are obtained from the simulation. Combinatorial background is parameterised with an exponential function with a decay constant that is allowed to vary in the fit. Finally, there is a small contribution from the decay \u039b 0 b \u2192 J/\u03c8 pK \u2212 , the shape of which is determined from the simulation and included in the fit to the data. In total, 1017 \u00b1 41 \u039b 0 b \u2192 J/\u03c8 p\u03c0 \u2212 candidates are observed. This yield is significantly lower than in refs.

The signal shape is determined from the fit to the normalisation decay mode in data, with corrections for the differences between the signal and normalisation modes obtained from the simulation. The combinatorial background is parameterised as in the fit for the normalisation mode. The shape of the partially reconstructed background is obtained from a fit to the \u039b 0 b \u2192 pK \u2212 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 mass spectrum and the yield is allowed to vary in the fit to the \u039b 0 b \u2192 p\u03c0 \u2212 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 mass distribution. A signal contribution is clearly visible and Wilks' theorem [26] gives a significance of 5.5 standard deviations. The systematic uncertainties described in section 6 are mainly associated with the normalisation. Only the systematic uncertainty arising from the shape assumed for the partially reconstructed background has any appreciable impact on the significance. Releasing the constraints on the relevant parameters, the significance increases to 5.7 standard deviations. Pseudoexperiments indicate that, on-average, the significance would be expected to decrease by 0.3 standard deviations. Given the statistical variation, the observed increase is perfectly compatible with the expectation.

In this case, the distribution in the simulation is weighted to match the data for the \u039b 0 b \u2192 J/\u03c8 p\u03c0 \u2212 decay - and the efficiency is reevaluated.

The effect of this assumption is estimated by allowing the shape parameters for the partially reconstructed background component to vary in the fit, and then calculating the resulting bias in the background estimation using pseudoexperiments. This results in a 6.9% uncertainty on the signal yield. As noted above, this is the only systematic uncertainty that has an appreciable effect on the significance for the observation of the decay \u039b 0 b \u2192 p\u03c0 \u2212 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 . Other, smaller uncertainties are assigned to the calculation of the efficiency: the calibration of the BDT efficiency using data (5.6%); the finite size of the simulation samples used (4.4%) and possible mismodelling of the trigger (3.4%). The statistical uncertainty on the \u039b 0 b \u2192 J/\u03c8 p\u03c0 \u2212 yield gives rise to a systematic uncertainty of 4.0%. Due to the low number of signal candidates, a small bias in the signal yield is observed. The size of this bias is calculated using pseudoexperiments and results in a 2.2% systematic uncertainty.
