The x-axis points from the IP to the centre of the LHC ring, and the y-axis points upward. The inner detector (ID) surrounds the interaction point; it includes a silicon pixel -5 -JHEP06(2016)081 detector (Pixel), a silicon microstrip detector (SCT) and a transition radiation tracker (TRT). The ID is immersed in an axial 2 T magnetic field. The ID covers the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 2.5. The pseudorapidity is defined in terms of the polar angle \u03b8 as \u03b7 = \u2212 ln tan(\u03b8/2). The ID is enclosed by a calorimeter system containing electromagnetic and hadronic sections. The calorimeter is surrounded by a large muon spectrometer (MS) in an air-core toroidal magnet system. The MS contains a combination of monitored drift tubes (MDTs) and cathode strip chambers (CSCs), designed to provide precise position measurements in the bending plane in the range |\u03b7| < 2.7. In addition, resistive plate chambers (RPCs) and thin gap chambers (TGCs) with a coarse position resolution but a fast response time are used primarily to trigger muons in the ranges |\u03b7| < 1.05 and 1.05 < |\u03b7| < 2.4, respectively. RPCs and TGCs are also used to provide position measurements in the non-bending plane and to improve the pattern recognition and track reconstruction. Momentum measurements in the MS are based on track segments formed in at least two of the three stations of the MDTs and the CSCs. The ATLAS trigger system had three levels during Run 1: the hardware-based Level-1 trigger and the two-stage High Level Trigger (HLT), which comprises the Level-2 trigger and the Event Filter. At Level-1, the muon trigger searched for patterns of hits satisfying different transverse momentum thresholds using the RPCs and TGCs. The region-of-interest around these Level-1 hit patterns then served as a seed for the HLT muon reconstruction, in which dedicated algorithms were used to incorporate information from both the MS and the ID, achieving a position and momentum resolution close to that provided by the offline muon reconstruction.",

The separation of the B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8K S and B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8K S contributions is important for the \u2206\u0393 d measurement because the mean lifetimes of the B 0 and B 0 s mesons decaying to this CP eigenstate are different. On the contrary, the separation of B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8K * 0 and B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8K * 0 decays is not necessary because the lifetimes of the B 0 and B 0 s mesons decaying to this final state are equal to within 1% [5,9]. Thus, the small (\u223c1%) contribution of the B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8K * 0 decay does not have an impact on the \u2206\u0393 d measurement. The fit ranges of the J/\u03c8K S and J/\u03c8K * 0 mass distributions are selected such that the background under the B 0 signal is smooth. The mass distribution m(J/\u03c8K S ) contains a contribution from partially reconstructed B \u2192 J/\u03c8K S \u03c0 decays. This contribution has a threshold at m(J/\u03c8K S ) 5130 MeV.

Therefore, the lower limit of the fit range of m(J/\u03c8K * 0 ) is selected at 5000 MeV. The impact of the selection of the fit range on the value of \u2206\u0393 d is included in the systematic uncertainty.

The signal function for the B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8K S channel f J/\u03c8K S s is defined as the sum of two Gaussian functions. The background is modelled by the sum of two functions: f J/\u03c8K S b = f c b + f Bs b .
