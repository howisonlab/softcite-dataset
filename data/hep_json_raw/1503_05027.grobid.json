The data correspond to total integrated luminosities of up to 9.7 fb \u22121 per experiment. The t-channel cross section is measured to be \u03c3t = 2.25 +0.29   \u22120.31 pb. We also present the combinations of the two-dimensional measurements of the s-vs. t-channel cross section. In addition, we give the combination of the s + t channel cross section measurement resulting in \u03c3s+t = 3.30 +0.52   \u22120.40 pb, without assuming the standardmodel value for the ratio \u03c3s/\u03c3t. The resulting value of the magnitude of the top-to-bottom quark coupling is |V tb | = 1.02 +0.",

Detailed studies of top-quark production and decay provide stringent tests of strong and electroweak interactions, as well as sensitivity to extensions of the SM [1]. At the Fermilab Tevatron collider, protons (p) and antiprotons (p) collided at a center-ofmass energy of \u221a s = 1.96 TeV. Top quarks were produced predominantly in pairs (tt) via the strong interaction [2]. They were also produced singly via the electroweak interaction. The cross section for single-topquark production depends on the square of the magnitude of the quark-mixing Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix [3] element V tb , and consequently is sensitive to contributions from a fourth family of quarks [4,5], as well as other new phenomena [6], which would lead to a measured strength of the W tb coupling |V tb | different from the SM prediction. Non-SM phenomena could also change the relative fraction of events produced in the various channels that contribute to the total single-topquark production cross section.",

Single top quarks are also produced in the s-channel via the decay of a time-like virtual W boson produced by quark-antiquark annihilation, which produces a top quark and a bottom quark [10] or in association with a W boson (Wt ) [11]. The predicted SM cross section for the t-channel process \u03c3 t is 2.10 \u00b1 0.13 pb [9], while the s-channel cross section \u03c3 s is 1.05 \u00b1 0.06 pb [12], both calculated at next-to-leading-order (NLO) in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) including next-to-next-toleading log (NNLL) corrections. A top-quark mass of 172.5 GeV was chosen, which is consistent with the current world average value [13]. The cross section for Wt production \u03c3 W t is negligibly small at the Tevatron and therefore is not considered in the combination described in this Letter. Since the magnitude of the W tb coupling is much larger than that of W td or of W ts [14], each top quark decays almost exclusively to a W boson and a b quark.",

In particular, we present a combined t-channel cross section, a combined two-dimensional measurement of the s-vs. t-channel cross sections, and a combination of the s + t-channel cross sections. The combination is obtained by collecting the inputs from both experiments and reperforming the statistical analysis. This approach allows for a tighter constraint on the systematic uncertainties that are common to both experiments, leading to a higher precision than that achievable from averaging the individual results. Here, we do not include the combination of the s-channel cross-section measurements, which was reported in Ref. [26]. We also measure the magnitude of the CKM matrix element V tb with no assumptions on the number of quark flavors.",

The data were selected using a logical OR of many online selection requirements that preserve high signal efficiency for offline analysis. Both collaborations analyze events with a lepton (\u2113 = e or \u00b5) plus jets and an imbalance in the total event transverse energy E T , reconstructed as the negative vector sum of all significant transverse energies in the calorimeter cells and the muon transverse momenta subtracting the calorimeter energy deposition due to muons (\u2113+jets). This topology is consistent with single-top-quark decays in which the decay W boson subsequently decays to \u2113\u03bd [20,22]. Events were selected that contain only one isolated lepton \u2113 with large transverse momentum p T , large E T , and two or three clusters of energy in the calorimeters (jets) with large p T . One or two of these jets were required to be identified as emerging from the hadronization of a b quark (b-tagged jets). Multivariate techniques were used to discriminate b-quark jets from light-quark and gluon jets [35,36]. Additional selection criteria were applied to exclude kinematic regions that were difficult to model and to minimize the background of multiple jets from QCD production (QCD multijet) in which one jet was misreconstructed as a lepton and spurious E T arose from mismeasurements [20,22].",

Large E T was required, and events with either two or three reconstructed jets were accepted. This additional sample increased the acceptance for signal events by including those in which the W -boson decay produced a lepton that is either not reconstructed or not isolated, or a \u03c4 lepton that decayed into hadrons and a neutrino, which were reconstructed as a third jet. After the basic event selection, QCD multijet events dominate the E T +jets event sample. To reduce this background, a selection based on an artificial neural network was optimized to preferentially select signal-like events [21].",

Reference [26] gives the sources of systematic uncertainty common to measurements of both collaborations that are assumed to be fully correlated, and lists uncertainties that are assumed to be uncorrelated.

[26]. The measured cross section is quoted as the value at the position of the maximum, and the 68% probability contour defines the measurement uncertainty. Figure 1 shows the distribution of the mean values from the discriminants sorted by the s-channel minus t-channel expected signal contributions divided by the background expectation, (s \u2212 t)/b. An entry in the histogram corresponds to a collection of bins with similar ratio (s \u2212 t)/b. The value on the horizontal axis is given by the mean discriminant for those bins. The vertical axis gives the number of events in those bins. We show the data, the SM predictions for the s-and t-channel processes, and the predicted backgrounds separated by source. The distribution for large negative values is dominated by the content of the bins that show a higher t-channel contribution, while large positive values are dominated by the content of the bins with a higher s-channel contribution. The abscissa extends to larger negative values since we expect more t-channel events than s-channel events and the separation from background is better for t-channel events than for s-channel events. The region corresponding to discriminant values near zero is dominated by the background. uncertainty in the individual cross sections are derived through the 1D posterior probability functions obtained by integrating the 2D posterior probability over the other variable. The most probable value of \u03c3 t is 2.25 +0.29 \u22120.31 pb. The measurement of \u03c3 s+t is performed without making assumptions on the ratio of \u03c3 s /\u03c3 t by forming a 2D posterior probability density distribution of \u03c3 s+t versus \u03c3 t and then integrating over all possible values of \u03c3 t to extract the 1D estimate of \u03c3 s+t . The combined cross section is \u03c3 s+t = 3.30 +0.52 \u22120.40 pb. The total expected uncertainty on \u03c3 s+t is 13%, the expected uncertainty without considering systematic uncertainties is 8%, and the expected systematic uncertainty is 10%. The systematic uncertainty from the limited precision of top-quark mass measurements is negligible [17,22]. Figure 2 also shows the expectation from several beyond the SM (BSM) models. Figure 3 shows the individual [21,22] and combined (this Letter) measurements of the t-and s + t-channel cross sections including previous measurements of the individual [22,24] and combined [26] s-channel cross sections. All measurements are consistent with SM predictions.",
