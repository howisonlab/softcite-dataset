            "text": "A new particle, with properties consistent with those of the standard model (SM) Higgs boson (H), was discovered at the CERN LHC with a mass near 125 GeV by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations [1][2][3]. Several properties of this particle have been measured to check its consistency with the SM [4][5][6][7][8][9]. Direct measurements of the total decay width of the Higgs boson (\u0393 H ) gave upper limits of 3.4 GeV in the 4 decay channel (where lepton, , corresponds to either an electron or a muon) [8] and 2.4 GeV in the \u03b3\u03b3 decay channel [7,10], which makes the particle compatible with a single narrow resonance. At the LHC, the precision of direct width measurements is limited by the instrumental resolution of the ATLAS and CMS experiments, which is three orders of magnitude larger than the expected natural width for the SM Higgs boson, \u0393 SM H \u223c 4.1 MeV [11]. The ratio of the natural width of the discovered boson with respect to that of the SM Higgs boson was assessed by ATLAS [12] in the combination of all on-shell decay modes, including invisible and undetectable ones, and found to be \u0393 H /\u0393 SM H = 0.64 +0.40 \u22120.25 under the model-dependent assumption that couplings of the 125 GeV boson to W and Z bosons could not be greater than those in the SM. The sizable off-shell production of the Higgs boson can also be used to constrain its natural width. A measurement of the relative off-shell and on-shell production JHEP09 (2016)051provides direct information on \u0393 H [13][14][15][16][17][18], as long as the Higgs boson off-and on-shell production mechanisms are the same as in the SM and the ratio of couplings governing off-and on-shell production remains unchanged with respect to the SM predictions. For example, we assume that the dominant production mechanism is gluon fusion (GF) and not quark-antiquark annihilation. Also, we assume that GF production is dominated by the top quark loop and there are no beyond-SM particles significantly contributing in the entire on/off-shell mass range probed by the analysis. Finally, the relative rate of off-shell and on-shell production depends on the tensor structure of the couplings for the discovered boson [19,20]. Possible contributions from anomalous couplings are not considered in this analysis.",

            "text": "Similarly, ATLAS presented a study in the ZZ and WW channels that constrained the observed (expected) upper limit on the off-shell event yield normalised to the SM prediction (signal strength \u00b5) to the range of 5. 1-8.6 (6.7-11.0). The range is determined by varying the gg \u2192 WW and gg \u2192 ZZ background K factor within the uncertainty of the higher-order QCD correction [23]. An observed (expected) upper 95% CL limit of \u0393 H < 23 (33) MeV was obtained, assuming the background K factor is equal to the signal K factor. This paper presents an analysis to constrain \u0393 H and the off-shell signal strength in the leptonic final states of the H \u2192 WW decay, based on the method proposed in ref. [24]. Our analysis follows the same methodology as used in the ZZ analysis mentioned above [21]. The WW channel has worse mass resolution than ZZ, which affects the width measurement. However, the WW channel benefits from a significantly larger branching fraction and a lower threshold for off-shell H \u2192 WW production [18]. To maximize sensitivity, the results of this analysis are combined with those obtained in the H \u2192 ZZ channel [21,22].",

Within the solenoid volume there are a sili-JHEP09(2016)051 con pixel and strip tracker, a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL), and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter, each composed of a barrel and two endcap sections. Forward calorimeters extend the pseudorapidity coverage provided by the barrel and endcap detectors up to |\u03b7| < 5. Muons are measured in gas-ionization detectors embedded in the steel flux-return yoke outside the solenoid. The missing transverse momentum vector p miss T is defined as the projection on the plane perpendicular to the beams of the negative vector sum of the momenta of all reconstructed particles in an event. Its magnitude is referred to as E miss T . A more detailed description of the CMS detector, together with a definition of the coordinate system and the relevant kinematic variables can be found in [27].",

A value in the range 1.6-2.6 has been obtained with an approximately flat dependency on m WW . For this analysis we use a value K = 2.1 affected by an uncertainty as large as 25% as discussed in section 7. A soft collinear approximation for the NNLO QCD calculation of the signal-background interference for the GF processes is reported in [43], which shows that the K factor computed for the SM Higgs boson signal process is a good approximation to the interference process K factor. A similar study using soft gluon resummation confirms the same K factor for the signal and the interference term at next-to-leading order (NLO) and NNLO [44]. The NLO QCD corrections to the LO background GF process, gg \u2192 WW, are computed in the heavy top quark approximation [45], which shows that the K factor for the background is similar to that for the signal. Therefore, the K factor calculated in the on-shell signal phase space is also used for the background and the interference term based on theoretical expectations. The K factor, defined as the ratio of NLO to LO cross sections for VBF production, has JHEP09(2016)051 been shown to be close to unity by the NLO calculation of electroweak and QCD processes, with a 2% theoretical uncertainty from missing higher-order effects [46]. The QCD NNLO calculations [47,48] provide an identical cross section as obtained with the QCD NLO calculation within a theoretical uncertainty of about 2%. Therefore the K factor of the VBF process is set to unity with a 2% theoretical uncertainty.",

A \"jet bin migration scale factor\" is estimated as a function of the generator-level m WW by the comparison of the reconstructionlevel gg2vv m WW spectrum to the powheg m WW spectrum for each jet bin. As an example, the jet bin migration scale factor for the 0-jet bin varies by about 20% in the range 160 GeV < m WW < 1 TeV, reducing the number of events in the 0-jet bin in the lowm WW region and increasing this number in the high-m WW region. This jet bin migration scale factor is applied as a weight to the gg2vv sample used in this analysis. The scale factor, calculated with the signal sample, is assumed to be the same for the background and interference samples. The application of the factor to the background and interference samples has a negligible effect on the results.",

The scalar p T sum excludes the contribution of the candidate lepton itself. To remove the contribution from the overlapping pileup interactions in this isolation region, the charged particles included in the computation of the isolation variable are required to originate from the primary vertex. The contribution of pileup photons and neutral hadrons is estimated by the average particle p T density deposited by neutral pileup particles, and is subtracted from the isolation cone [52]. The relative electron isolation is defined by the ratio of the scalar p T sum in the isolation cone of \u2206R = 0.3 to the transverse momentum of the candidate electron. Isolated electrons are selected by requiring the relative isolation to be below \u223c10%. The exact threshold value depends on the electron \u03b7 and p T [53,54]. For each muon candidate, the scalar p T sum is computed in isolation cones of several radii around the muon direction. This information is combined using a multivariate algorithm that exploits the particles momentum deposition in the isolation annuli to discriminate between prompt muons and the muons from hadron decays inside a jet [28].",

To increase the sensitivity to the SM Higgs boson signal, events with a high-p T lepton pair of different flavor (one electron and one muon, e\u00b5) are selected, and categorized according to jet multiplicities: zero jets (0-jet category), one jet (1-jet category), and two or more jets (2-jet category). Higgs boson signal events in the 0-and 1-jet categories are mostly produced by the GF process, whereas the 2-jet category is more sensitive to the VBF production. The WW baseline selection criteria are the same as those used in the on-shell H \u2192 WW analysis [37]. For all jet multiplicity categories, candidate events are required to have two oppositely charged different-flavor leptons with p 1 T > 20 GeV for the leading lepton and p 2 T > 10 GeV for the sub-leading lepton. Lepton pseudorapidities are restricted to be in the acceptance region of the detector, |\u03b7| < 2.5 (2.4) for electrons (muons). A small number of the electrons and muons considered in the analysis come from leptonic decays of \u03c4 leptons after high p T cuts of lepton. Using simulation, the signal contribution of \u03c4 leptonic decay from the H \u2192 WW process, with one or both W bosons decaying to \u03c4 \u03bd, is estimated to be about 10%. The E miss T,min variable is required to be above 20 GeV to suppress Z/\u03b3 * \u2192 + \u2212 and Z/\u03b3 * \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 backgrounds. The analysis requires the invariant mass of the dilepton m > 12 GeV to reject the contributions from charmonium and bottomonium resonance decays. Events having any b jet are vetoed in order to suppress background events with top quarks. The selection defined above is referred to as the WW baseline selection.",

This efficiency is then used to weight the data with the loose selection to obtain the estimated contribution from the non-prompt lepton background in the signal region. The systematic uncertainty has two sources: the dependence of pass on the sample composition, and the method. The total uncertainty in pass , including the statistical precision of the control sample is about 40% for all cases (on-and off-shell, and all jet categories).",

            "text": "To exploit the full power of the Higgs boson width measurement technique based on the off-shell Higgs boson production approach, the results using H \u2192 WW reported here are combined with those found using H \u2192 ZZ [21,22]. The H \u2192 ZZ results are obtained using datasets corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 5.1 (19.7) fb \u22121 at 7 (8) TeV. The statistical methodology used in this combination is the same as the one employed in ref. [21]. The likelihood of the off-shell signal strength is scanned with the assumption of SU(2) custodial symmetry for the combination: \u00b5 ZZ GF /\u00b5 WW GF = \u00b5 ZZ VBF /\u00b5 WW VBF = \u039b WZ = 1. The observed (expected) constraints on the off-shell signal strengths at 95% CL are \u00b5 off-shell GF < 2.4 (6.2) and \u00b5 off-shell VBF < 19.3 (34.4), as shown in figure 8. For the likelihood scan of \u0393 H , this analysis considers the possible difference of signal strength measurements between the two Higgs boson decay modes with an assumption that the ratio of signal strengths is the same for each GF and VBF processes. Accordingly, \u00b5 WW GF , \u00b5 WW VBF , \u00b5 ZZ GF , and \u00b5 ZZ VBF can be expressed in terms of three independent parameters left floating in the fit: \u00b5 GF , \u00b5 VBF , and \u039b WZ : \u00b5 WW GF = \u00b5 GF , \u00b5 WW VBF = \u00b5 VBF , \u00b5 ZZ GF = \u039b WZ \u00b5 GF , and \u00b5 ZZ VBF = \u039b WZ \u2022 \u00b5 VBF , where \u00b5 GF and \u00b5 VBF are the Higgs boson signal strengths for the GF and VBF production as in eq. (6.2) and \u039b WZ is the common ratio \u00b5 ZZ GF /\u00b5 WW GF = \u00b5 ZZ VBF /\u00b5 WW VBF = \u039b WZ . Figure 9 shows the combined likelihood scan as a function of the Higgs boson width. The observed (expected) combined limit for the width corresponds to 13 (26) MeV at 95% CL. The observed limit improves by 50% the result of the H \u2192 WW channel alone (<26 MeV) and by 41% the observed limit of < 22 MeV set in the H \u2192 ZZ channel alone [21]. The result is about a factor of 3 larger than the SM expectation of \u0393 H \u2248 4 MeV. Using pseudo data generated with the SM Higgs boson width, the p-value for the observed limit is 7.4%. The relaxation of the same GF and VBF signal strength ZZ/WW ratios increases the observed combined 95% CL limit on the width to \u0393 H < 15 MeV.",

The data observed in this analysis are used to constrain the Higgs boson total decay width. The analysis is based on pp collision data collected by the CMS experiment at \u221a s = 7 and 8 TeV, corresponding to integrated luminosities of 4.9 and 19.4 fb \u22121 respectively. The observed and expected upper limits for the off-shell signal strengths at 95% CL are 3.5 and 16.0 for the gluon fusion process, and 48.1 and 99.2 for the vector boson fusion process. The observed and expected constraints on the Higgs boson total width are, respectively, \u0393 H < 26 and <66 MeV, obtained at the 95% CL. These results are combined with those obtained earlier in the H \u2192 ZZ channel, which further improves the observed and expected upper limits of the off-shell signal strengths to 2.4 and 6.2 for the gluon fusion process, and 19.3 and 34.4 for the vector boson fusion process.
