The theory becomes predictive when these and several other fundamental parameters have been determined experimentally. By progressively improving the precision of these parameters, the theoretical predictions become increasingly precise and, in turn, the experimental measurements are increasingly sensitive to new physics beyond the Standard Model. Therefore, on quite general grounds, it is important for each of the fundamental parameters of the Standard Model to be measured with the highest possible experimental precision.",

The high rate is achieved by means of a highly granular and fast detector that can measure several muon decays in parallel. The imaging target ( Fig. 1) essentially comprises a large number of replicated minidetectors placed side-by-side, each one capable of making an independent and simultaneous measurement of a \u03bc + decay. With regards to systematic uncertainties, the detector is designed to suppress several effects that limited previous experiments. Firstly, pile-up effects are reduced by a fast, imaging detector. Secondly, possible gain shifts and additional event losses at the start of the muon decay period due to the higher counting rate are avoided by operating in a DC beam (uniform counting rate). Thirdly, muon spin polarisation systematics, arising from spin precession in the geomagnetic field and non-isotropic positron detection efficiency, are strongly suppressed by (a) using a \u03c0 + beam (spin 0) and tagging the \u03c0 \u2192 \u03bc transition, (b) applying range cuts that further suppress residual beam muons, (c) designing a uniform detector with large angular acceptance, and (d) providing an 80 G magnetic field across the target, which causes rapid precession of the muon spins so that any residual spin effects can be observed and measured.",

The adopted solution is to carry out a full analysis of all data online, and to record approximately each hour a set of about 1200 separate muon lifetime histograms that contain all the information required for the lifetime measurement and for the study of systematic errors. In addition, a pre-scaled fraction of the raw events-of order 1% depending on the rate-are recorded for monitoring purposes and to study specific aspects of the systematic errors. A web-based online monitor program accumulates control histograms to verify the proper functioning of the detector and provides a warning if any distribution falls outside its pre-defined tolerance.

The second method uses the Fourier transform of the data to determine the frequency with the highest power, which corresponds to the beam frequency. Both methods agree and determine the beam period to be 18.960051 TDC ticks, with a precision of better than 1 ppm. Since this does not correspond to an integer number of TDC ticks, the data are \"RF rebinned\" by dividing fractional TDC ticks into the two adjacent bins according to a linear sharing algorithm. A further periodicity is introduced in the data by a non-linearity of the TDCs. Although the coarse ticks are perfectly paced by the 30 MHz Rb atomic clock, the 32 fine ticks are determined by the TDC chip interpolation. This was found to have a non-linearity with an amplitude of 0.1%, introducing periodicities of 16 and 32 ticks in the fit residuals.

The influence on the measured lifetime is \u03c4 \u03bc < 0.2 ppm. Finally, in order to evaluate possible biases of the rebinned method, the results have been compared with an alternative evaluation using the fine binned data. The method used to obtain the lifetime from the fine binned histogram is described above. The results for both methods are shown in Fig. 5(a). In addition, the fine binned method has been applied to the data rebinned into integer numbers of bins between 2 and 34 TDC ticks. The relatively small variations that are seen reflect limitations to the description of the background structure in the integer rebinned data. The difference of the fitted lifetime with the fine binned (1 TDC tick) data relative to the RF rebinned data is \u03c4 \u03bc = \u22125.2 ppm. This value is stable throughout the data-taking period and is independent of the fitted range and independent of the pion stop position in the target. It is thus a robust estimate of a systematic difference between the fits describing the two data sets. For the reasons described above, we understand this difference as a sensitivity of the fine binned data to a precision description of the sub-RF periodic structure and, on the other hand, no sensitivity to this component in the RF rebinned data.

No systematic effects are observed except as a function of PSPM, where the lifetimes mea-sured in two PSPMs (numbers 12 and 49) are found to deviate by more than 3\u03c3 from the nominal value ( Fig. 5(b)). The effect of the position of the muon decay inside the PSPM, with respect to the beam direction, has also been checked by folding all the measured decays into an effective single PSPM (Fig. 5(c)). The lifetime has also been determined on the samples separated according to the relative position of the pion and muon stop pixels, again with respect to the beam direction, to check for any biases from this source ( Fig. 5(d) carried out for evidence of anomalous behaviour in these two PSPMs. No anomalies have been found in their performance characteristics, including hit detection efficiencies, afterpulsing probabilities and time spectra. In addition, several checks have been performed to assess the robustness of the systematic error estimation. The range of the fit has been varied and different fit methods have been applied. The lifetime has also been determined as a function of the relative position of the pion and muon stop pixel in the PSPM. Consistent results have been obtained in all cases. Finally, the observed effect is found to be stable throughout the run. The conclusions from these studies are that the two PSPMs display no evidence for anomalous behaviour and that their pull on the fitted lifetime is stable both in sign and in absolute value. Although a statistical fluctuation cannot be excluded, we assign the full observed lifetime shift as a conservative estimate of the associated systematic error. In summary, the total systematic error due to detector nonuniformities is estimated to be \u03c4 \u03bc = +7.6 ppm.",

This was automatically identified when it happened by a characteristic broadening of the time distribution of the beam pion pixels. The DAQ then ended the run, tagged that run as bad, re-initialised the TDCs, and started a new run. The tagged data samples were removed from the analysis. To eliminate the possibility of any residual effect from untagged events with broadened timing, the bad runs have been collected together and fitted for the muon lifetime. The value obtained is compatible with the nominal lifetime, within the relatively large statistical errors, \u03c4 \u03bc = 15 \u00b1 60 ppm. Further evidence against a residual error from this source is that there was a significant difference in susceptibility to this problem among the 16 TDCs, yet there is no sign of any different lifetime measurement from the susceptible TDCs. In conclusion, there is no evidence for any systematic effect from this source. 7. Muon spin rotation (\u03bcSR): Muon spin rotation effects are highly suppressed in FAST as a result of the basic experimental design. Nevertheless, spin effects can be extracted from the data by selection of special event topologies. These make use of the fact that the muon spin is 100% polarised in the direction pointing back to the parent pion. A \u03bcSR signal can be obtained, for example, by selecting events where the \u03c0 , \u03bc and positron are in the same pixel, or where the \u03c0 and \u03bc are in the same pixel but not the positron. From these data, the \u03bcSR period is measured to be T \u03bcSR = 931 TDC ticks (970 ns), in agreement with that expected for \u223c 80 G magnetic field.",

This artificially divides the FAST detector into 8 smaller detectors with highly-directional positron acceptance. The small (per mil) \u03bcSR signals observed in the artificial \"subdetectors\" indicates the highly suppressed muon polarisation component in FAST achieved by the design of the detector and the use of a stopping pion beam. The \u03bcSR effect is absent in the full sample (shown in the central panel).(b) Corresponding Fourier transforms of these distributions. For all abscissa, the units are TDC ticks. The \u03bcSR period is indicated by the vertical lines at 931 TDC ticks. a clear \u03bcSR signal in the forward-backward (\u03c6 = 0 \u2022 and 180 \u2022 ) and left-right (90 \u2022 and 270 \u2022 ) directions. The \u03bcSR amplitude is about 0.1% and the phase at t e = n \u2022 T \u03bcSR , with n = 0, 1, . . . , gives a peak deficiency for 0 \u2022 and 180 \u2022 , and a peak excess for 90 \u2022 and 270 \u2022 . This is due to a small difference in the solid angle for positrons to be classified as 0 \u2022 between muons located near the upstream compared with downstream edges of the pion pixel, which arises from the relatively coarse pixel granularity. For example, at t e = 0, the downstream muons have a higher solid angle for classification as \u03c6 = 0 \u2022 decays than do the upstream muons, which leads to a net deficiency. The mirror effect (with the same phase) occurs for positrons at 180 \u2022 . The small t e = 0 deficiency at 0 \u2022 and 180 \u2022 appears as a symmetric excess at 90 \u2022 and 270 \u2022 , and cancels almost completely along the diagonal directions. This pattern then oscillates with the \u03bcSR frequency and gradually decays as the muons depolarise. In short, the small \u03bcSR signal in the 0 \u2022 and 180 \u2022 directions due to muons emitted in the forward-backward direction is causingand is therefore exactly compensated by-an anti-phase \u03bcSR signal in the 90 \u2022 and 270 \u2022 directions. This is confirmed by the central distribution inFig. 6(a), which shows no \u03bcSR signal when all positron directions are combined.Fig. 6(b)shows the corresponding Fourier transform for each of the positron directions. The \u03bcSR signal is seen to be completely absent in the summed data. We conclude that no systematic errors are present due to \u03bcSR effects. Furthermore, the equality of the \u03bcSR signal in the 0 \u2022 and 180 \u2022 directions confirms that there is a negligible residual component of beam muons, which would produce a forward-backward \u03bcSR asymmetry.",
