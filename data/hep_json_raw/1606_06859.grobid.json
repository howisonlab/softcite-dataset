Development of algorithms for efficient identification of such \"boosted\" particles while rejecting the background from multihadron jets from light quarks and gluons can greatly aid in the sensitivity of measurements and new particle searches. This paper presents a new method for identifying boosted high-mass particles using event shapes in Lorentz-boosted reference frames. Variables calculated in these frames for multihadronic jets can then be used as input to a large artificial neural network to discriminate their origin.",

The large LHC general-purpose experimental collaborations ATLAS and CMS, working with theoretical colleagues, have developed powerful new analysis techniques to efficiently identify highmomentum (\"highly boosted\") hadronically decaying top quarks, Higgs bosons, and W and Z bosons, while rejecting the background from multijet final states produced in QCD processes. As energies increase, the rate of production of highly boosted heavy particles increases dramatically due to the increased parton-parton luminosity at large invariant masses. Numerous production mechanisms for highly boosted particles exist within the standard model (SM) and are predicted in theories beyond the standard model (BSM).",

By \"fat\" we mean here a jet reconstructed using a large value of the cone size parameter governing the jet finding algorithm, for example the anti-k T algorithm [6] with a cone size paramter of 0.8. The algorithms look for substructure within such jets, where there are distinct and separable deposits of energy from the individual jets formed from the initial-state b quark and light quark jets from the top decay. Similar algorithms can be used to identify boosted W and Z bosons decaying to quark pairs, and Higgs bosons decaying to bb.",

In the correct reference frame one would expect to see back-to-back jets for a W , Z, or H event, and three jets in a plane for a t quark decay. Figure 1 shows the momentum vectors of the final state particles from a top quark decay in the laboratory frame and in a boosted frame corresponding to that of a top quark with the momentum of the jet. As the figure shows, one clearly sees a three-jet structure in the boosted frame, which in the laboratory appears to have a two-jet substructure.

These include Fox-Wolfram moments [8], the eigenvalues of the sphericity tensor [9], and thrust [10]. We also run the anti-k T jet finding algorithm in the boosted frame, relative to the boost axis and using a cone size parameter of 0.5. We then calculate the E T of the four leading jets, the masses of pairs of the three leading jets, and the invariant mass of the four leading jets. If we have boosted into the correct frame, corresponding to the true origin of the fat jet, then we would expect that the overall momentum of the boosted constituents should be near zero, either in terms of the total momentum or the momentum along the boost direction. Hence we also calculate the magnitude of the total momentum of the four leading jets and the ratio of their longitudinal momentum sum to the total. Generically we call these quantities \"boosted event shapes\" (BES). This approach is inspired by earlier work at LEP aimed at discriminating bb decays of the Z boson using the \"boosted sphericity product\" [11]. It differs from the approach described in [12], and employed by the ATLAS experiment in their measurement of highp T vector boson pair prodiction cross section [13], in that we do not assume a rest frame based on the invariant mass of the sum of the observed jet constituents.",

Perhaps the main reason is that in real analyses the identification of individual jet constituents will not be as efficient or accurate as assumed in this prototype study. At very high momentum, in particular, when there is more confusion between neutral particles, it may be necessary to rely solely on charged particles. For this reason we tested the performance of the BES algorithm using charged tracks only, selecting only those generator-level final state particles which were charged, having p T > 2 GeV. Figures 3 and 4 compare the results using charged constituents only to the results from using both charged and neutral constituents.

To test this we also used samples of a 3 TeV mass Z decaying to tt, ZH, W + W \u2212 , and bb. As before the events are simulated with PYTHIA and passed through the PGS simulation. Fat jets (anti-k T , R = 0.8) are then matched to the decaying boosted objects and 90% of the jet constituents with p T > 2 GeV and lying within \u2206R < 0.8 of the jet direction are recorded for the BES analysis. We consider here the performance using both charged and neutral objects.",

Figure 5 shows these distributions for the five jet categories, and illustrates the great potential to discriminate them well, even W from Z decays. As an example, Figure 6 shows the efficiency for identifying top quark decays as a function of the efficiency for identifying the other particle types.",

We note that these can be at least partly overcome by training the neural network using background (light quark and gluon) samples derived from observed dijet events, where the other jet is antitagged as coming from t/H/Z/W . Finally, we emphasize that the variables arising from the boosted event shapes can be readily combined with variables used in other approaches, including the presently used N subjettiness [18] and softdrop mass, and other novel approaches such as those based on two-dimensional imaging of jets [20], to arrive at an even more selective algorithm. One can expect, hoever, that the the BES variables will retain their discriminating power up to ultrahigh boosts at which 2D variables become less discriminating. ",

These quantities include the Fox-Wolfram moments, sphericity tensor and its eigenvalues, thrust, and quantities derived from anti-k T jets calculated using the boost axis as the \"beam\". The algorithm is capable of separating jets which strongly overlap in laboratory momentum space. In an initial, ideal-ized scenario using generator-level particles the algorithm shows excellent separation of hadronic jets arising from the decay of top quarks, Higgs bosons, Z and W bosons and from b quarks. This level of separation is largely maintained when using charged jet constituents only, as might be necessary for ultrahigh-energy jets. The variables arising in this algorithm can be readily combined with those from other boosted particle tagging techniques.",
