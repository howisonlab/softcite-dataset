The data set was collected with the CMS detector and corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 19.3 fb \u22121 . The measured fiducial cross section for W bosons decaying to electrons or muons and for p T j1 > 60 GeV, p T j2 > 50 GeV, |\u03b7 j | < 4.7, and m jj > 1000 GeV is 0.42 \u00b1 0.04 (stat) \u00b1 0.09 (syst) \u00b1 0.01 (lumi) pb. This result is consistent with the standard model leading-order prediction of 0.50 \u00b1 0.02 (scale) \u00b1 0.02 (PDF) pb obtained with MadGraph5 amc@nlo 2.1 interfaced to pythia 6.4. This is the first cross section measurement for this process.",

This process is characterized by the presence of two jets with a large separation in rapidity [1,2]. Experimental studies of this topology are challenging because of large backgrounds and require a precise understanding of extra quark and gluon emissions computed in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) [3].",

Within the solenoid volume are a silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL), and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter (HCAL), each composed of a barrel and two endcap sections. Forward calorimeters extend the pseudorapidity [14] coverage provided by the barrel and endcap detectors. Muons are measured in gas-ionization detectors embedded in the steel flux-return yoke outside the solenoid. The silicon tracker measures charged particles within the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 2.5. It consists of 1440 silicon pixel and 15 148 silicon strip detector modules and is located in the 3.8 T field of the superconducting solenoid.

The momentum resolution for electrons with transverse momentum p T \u2248 45 GeV from Z \u2192 ee decays ranges from 1.7% for nonshowering electrons in the barrel region to 4.5% for showering electrons in the endcaps [16].

The lower required m jj value provides a larger sample of events that help avoid over-training the BDT. Studies give no indication of a bias as a function of the minimum m jj . On average the EW events have higher BDT values than the background events. The QCD W+jet simulation overestimates the event yield in the data set, and therefore a data-to-MC scaling factor is extracted as follows. The other background contributions are fixed to their simulated yields while the normalization of the QCD W+jets simulated events is scaled so that the total number of events in simulation equals that in the data set for BDT values less than 0.1. The fit is performed for events with m jj > 1000 GeV. The normalization uncertainties of the other backgrounds are considered as a source of systematic uncertainty. Systematic uncertainties related to the remaining discrepancy between data and simulation and to the contamination from signal in the BDT <0.1 region, especially in the muon channel as shown in figure 2, are discussed in section 6. The resulting W+jets normalization factors are 0.71 \u00b1 0.02 (stat) \u00b1 0.03 (syst) and 0.70 \u00b1 0.02 (stat) \u00b1 0.05 (syst) for the electron and muon channels, respectively. These normalization factors are applied in addition to the NNLO K factor of approximately 1.24, mentioned in section 3. The scale factor relative to LO is thus around 0.87, which agrees with the result in [57] and has also been verified with MCFM. Finally, similar numbers are found in another CMS analysis involving the VBF topology [58]. The QCD W+jets normalization scale factors are used later in the fit to the m jj distributions when extracting the number of signal events.",
