            "text": "The discovery of a Higgs boson H at the CERN LHC [1][2][3] suggests that the standard model (SM) mechanism that connects electroweak (EW) symmetry breaking to the generation of particle masses is largely correct. However, the relatively light value of the Higgs boson mass m H = 125.09 \u00b1 0.21 (stat) \u00b1 0.11 (syst) GeV [4][5][6][7] leaves the hierarchy problem unsolved [8], pointing to phenomena beyond the SM, which could be unveiled by searches at the LHC. Many theories that incorporate phenomena beyond the SM postulate the existence of new heavy resonances coupled to the SM bosons. Among them, weakly coupled spin-1 Z [9,10] and W models [11] or strongly coupled Composite Higgs [12][13][14], and Little Higgs models [15][16][17] have been widely discussed.",

The HVT model is parametrized in terms of three parameters: the strength g V of a new interaction; the coupling c H between the heavy vector bosons, the Higgs boson, and longitudinally polarized SM vector bosons; and the coupling c F between the HVT bosons and the SM fermions. In the HVT scenario, model B with parameters g V = 3, c H = 0.976, and c F = 1.024 [18] is used as the benchmark. With E-mail address: cms-publication-committee-chair@cern.ch. these values, the couplings of the heavy resonances to fermions and to SM bosons are similar, yielding a sizable branching fraction for the heavy resonance decay into a SM vector boson W or Z (generically labeled as V) and a Higgs boson [18].",

In this mass region, the two bosons produced in the resonance decay would have large Lorentz boosts in the laboratory frame. When decaying, each boson would generate a pair of collimated particles, a distinctive signature, which can be well identified in the CMS experiment. Because of the large predicted branching fraction, the decay of high-momentum Higgs bosons to bb final states is considered. The Higgs boson is reconstructed as one unresolved jet, tagged as containing at least one bottom quark. Backgrounds from single quark and gluon jets are reduced by a jet mass requirement. In order to discriminate against the large multijet background, the search is focused on the leptonic decays of the vector bosons (Z \u2192 \u03bd\u03bd, W \u2192 \u03bd, and Z \u2192 , with = e, \u03bc).",

In order to suppress the contamination from pileup, charged particles not originating from the primary vertex, taken to be the one with the highest sum of p 2 T over its constituent tracks, are discarded. The residual contamination removed is proportional to the event energy density and the jet area estimated using the FastJet package [42,43]. Jet energy corrections, extracted from simulation and data in multijet, \u03b3 +jets, and Z+jets events, are applied as functions of the transverse momentum and pseudorapidity to correct the jet response and to account for residual differences between data and simulation. The jet energy resolution amounts typically to 5% at 1 TeV [44]. Jets are required to pass an identification criterion, based on the jet composition in terms of the different classes of PF candidates, in order to remove spurious jets arising from detector noise. The pruning algorithm [45], which is designed to remove contributions from soft radiation and additional interactions, is applied to AK8 jets. The pruned jet mass m j is defined as the invariant mass associated with the four-momentum of the pruned jet, after the application of the jet energy corrections [44]. The AK8 jets are split into two subjets using the soft drop algorithm [46,47].",

Systematic uncertainties are treated as nuisance parameters and are profiled in the statistical interpretation [56][57][58][59]. The background-only hypothesis is tested against the X \u2192 VH signal in the ten categories. The asymptotic modified frequentist method is used to determine limits at 95% confidence level (CL) on the contribution from signal. Limits are derived on the product of the cross section for a heavy vector boson X and the branching fractions for the decays X \u2192 VH and H \u2192 bb, denoted \u03c3 (X) B(X \u2192 VH) B(H \u2192 bb). No specific assumption is made on B(H \u2192 bb), since this decay channel has not yet been measured. The 0 and 2 categories are combined to provide upper limits for the case where X is a heavy spin-1 vector singlet Z , in the narrow-width approximation. Similarly the 1 categories are combined to provide limits for the case where X is a heavy W . The exclusion limits are reported in Fig. 3. These limits are verified with the modified frequentist CL s method, obtaining results compatible with those obtained with the asymptotic formula. The result of this study is primarily interpreted in the context of a simplified model with a triplet of heavy vector bosons (V \u00b1 , V 0 ) [18]. The predictions of the benchmark model B are superimposed on the exclusion limits in Fig. 3. All the 0 , 1 , and 2 channels are combined to put stringent exclusion limits on the HVT model, scenario B, assuming the Z and W cross sections as predicted by the model. There are normalization increases caused by event migration between the leptonic channels, which are estimated to be 5-10% in the 0 channel, due to mis-assigned W events, and less than 1% in the 1 channel, due to mis-assigned Z events. Fig. 4 presents the exclusion limits as a function of the heavy triplet mass. A resonance with m X 2.0 TeV is excluded at 95% CL in the HVT model B.",

The excluded region of the parameter space for narrow resonances relative to the combination of all the considered channels is shown in Fig. 5. The fraction of the parameter space where the natural width of the resonances is larger than the typical experimental resolution of 5%, and thus the narrow width approximation is not valid, is also indicated in Fig. 5. The exclusion of the parameter space significantly improves on the reach of \u221a s = 8 TeV searches in the 1 [22] and all-hadronic channels [20]. The sensitivity is equivalent within the statistical and systematic uncertainties to the corresponding \u221a s = 13 TeV search from ATLAS [60]. responds to the region where the resonance natural width is predicted to be larger than the typical experimental resolution (5%), and thus the narrow-width approximation breaks down.

Similarly, the singlelepton (1 ) and double-lepton (2 ) channels each comprise four categories. In total, 10 exclusive categories are defined. In the 0 channel, candidate signal events are expected to have a large E miss T due to the boosted Z boson decaying into a pair of neutrinos, which escape undetected.

The Higgs boson jet candidate must fulfill the tighter requirement \u03c6(jet, p miss T ) > 2 and additional criteria designed to remove events arising from detector noise. Events containing isolated leptons with p T > 10 GeV, hadronically-decaying \u03c4 leptons with p T > 18 GeV, and photons with p T > 15 GeV are removed in order to reduce the contribution of other SM processes. The tt background contribution is reduced by removing events in which any AK4 jet, excluding the Higgs boson jet candidate, is b tagged using the loose operating point. Because of the lack of visible decay products from the Z boson, reconstruction of the resonance mass is not directly viable. Instead, the Higgs boson jet momentum and the p miss T are used to compute the transverse mass m T VH = 2E miss T E jet T [1 \u2212 cos \u03c6(jet, p miss T )]. This variable is utilized as an estimator of m X for the 0 channel. Events in the 1 channel are collected requiring one lepton to be reconstructed online. The p T threshold at trigger level is 105 GeV for electrons and 45 GeV for muons. Offline, events are accepted if there is exactly one reconstructed electron or muon with p T larger than 135 GeV or 55 GeV, respectively, passing restrictive selection criteria. Events with additional leptons passing looser selections, or hadronically decaying \u03c4 leptons, are discarded. In the single-electron channel, multijet background is reduced by requiring E miss T > 80 GeV. Azimuthal angular separations \u03c6( , p miss T ) < 2 and \u03c6(jet, p miss T ) > 2 are required to select a back-to-back topology. As for the 0 selection, events with additional b-tagged AK4 jets are vetoed. The four-momentum of the W boson candidate is quantified using a kinematic reconstruction of the neutrino momentum. The components of the neutrino momentum in the transverse plane are assumed to be equal to p miss T . By constraining the invariant mass of the charged lepton and neutrino to be equal to the W boson mass, a quadratic equation is derived for the longitudinal component of the neutrino momentum, p \u03bd z .
