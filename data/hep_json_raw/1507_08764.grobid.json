            "text": "The differential cross sections for inclusive neutral pions as a function of transverse and longitudinal momentum in the very forward-rapidity region have been measured at the LHC with the LHC forward detector in proton-proton collisions at ffiffi ffi s p \u00bc 2.76 and 7 TeV and in proton-lead collisions at nucleonnucleon center-of-mass energies of ffiffiffiffiffiffiffi ffi s NN p \u00bc 5.02 TeV. Such differential cross sections in proton-proton collisions are compatible with the hypotheses of limiting fragmentation and Feynman scaling. Comparing proton-proton with proton-lead collisions, we find a sizable suppression of the production of neutral pions in the differential cross sections after subtraction of ultraperipheral proton-lead collisions. This suppression corresponds to the nuclear modification factor value of about 0.1-0.3. The experimental measurements presented in this paper provide a benchmark for the hadronic interaction Monte Carlo simulation codes that are used for the simulation of cosmic ray air showers.

            "text": "Observations of high-energy cosmic rays with energy above 10 14 eV provide key information for a yet unestablished origin(s) and acceleration mechanism(s) for cosmic rays. The compilation of current observations reveals kinks in the energy spectrum that agree with the turning points in the mass composition [1] at \u223c3 \u00d7 10 15 eV (the so-called knee) and provide a consistent description of the transition from Galactic to extragalactic cosmic rays at \u223c5 \u00d7 10 18 eV (the so-called ankle). In particular, a cutoff feature of ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) at \u223c5 \u00d7 10 19 eV is supposed to existence of Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin [2,3] cutoff, while the source and propagation of the UHECRs is still a mystery [4]. In order to grasp the experimental signature of the source of UHECRs and to understand a consistent picture of transition from the galactic component around 10 14 eV, many extensive air-shower experiments, including ongoing UHECR observatories (i.e., Auger [5] and Telescope Array [6]) have collected the data on the energy spectrum, mass composition, and arrival direction of UHECR high-energy cosmic rays over the past few decades [7][8][9].",

Currently, the lack of knowledge about forward particle production in hadronic collisions at high energy hinders the interpretation of observations of high-energy cosmic rays [10].",

However, extrapolation from the LHC energy range to a higher energy range can be achieved by using a scaling law in the forwardrapidity region. One possibility for such a scaling law is the hypothesis of limiting fragmentation [12][13][14], which specifies that the secondary particles will approach a limiting distribution of rapidity in the rest frame of the target hadron. In this case, the fragmentation of a colliding hadron would occur independently of the center-of-mass energy, and then the differential cross sections as a function of rapidity (hereafter, rapidity distributions) in the fragmentation region, namely the forward-rapidity region, would form a limiting distribution.",

The LHCf experiment also provides a unique opportunity to investigate all the effects mentioned in the previous paragraph, namely, the limiting fragmentation, the Feynman scaling [17], and the high parton density in a nuclear target. In a previous publication [18], we presented the \u03c0 0 production cross sections as a function of the transverse momentum (hereafter, p T distributions) in p \u00fe p collisions at ffiffi ffi s p \u00bc 7 TeV. However, tests of the limiting fragmentation and the Feynman scaling predictions were not performed. Conversely, in the analysis of this paper, the comparison of the LHCf data taken in p \u00fe p collisions at ffiffi ffi s p \u00bc 2.76 and 7 TeV makes it possible to perform these tests. In addition, the analysis presented in this paper has updates that lead to a deeper understanding of forward \u03c0 0 production compared to our previous publications [18,19]: the upper range for p T analysis is extended to 1.0 GeV, and differential cross sections as a function of longitudinal momentum (hereafter, p z distributions) as well as p T distributions are presented. The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, the LHCf detectors are described. Sections III and IV, we summarize the conditions for taking data and the MC simulation methodology, respectively. In Sec. V, the analysis framework and the factors that contribute to the systematic uncertainty of the results are explained. In Sec. VI, the analysis results are presented and compared with the predictions of several hadronic interaction models. In Sec. VII, the analysis results for p \u00fe p and p \u00fe Pb collisions are described. Finally, concluding remarks are found in Sec. VIII.",

The trajectories of charged particles produced at IP1 and directed toward the TANs are deflected by the inner beam separation dipole magnets D1 before reaching the TANs themselves. Consequently, only neutral particles produced at IP1 enter the LHCf detectors. The vertical positions of the LHCf detectors in the TANs are manipulated so that the LHCf detectors cover the pseudorapidity range from 8.4 to infinity for a beam crossing half angle of 145 \u03bcrad. The small calorimeter effectively covers the zero-degree collision angle. Following p \u00fe Pb collision operation, the LHCf detectors were removed from the TAN instrumentation slots in April 2013 in order to protect them from radiation damage when the LHC is operated at high luminosity.",

A second level trigger is generated when a shower trigger has occurred and the data acquisition system is activated. The highest level trigger, or third level trigger, is generated when a specified combination of shower triggers, front counter triggers, and data acquisition trigger has occurred.

The coefficients of the function are determined from the response of the calorimeters to single photons using MC simulations.

The invariant mass of the two photons is calculated using the reconstructed photon energies and incident positions. The \u03c0 0 events used in the analysis of this paper are classified into two categories: Type-I \u03c0 0 and Type-II \u03c0 0 events. A Type-I event is defined as having a single photon in each of the two calorimeters of Arm1 or Arm2 (the left panel of Fig. 1). A Type-II event is defined as having two photons in the same calorimeter (the right panel of Fig. 1). Note that Type-II events were not used in the previous analyses [18,19] and thus are taken into account for the first time in this paper. As detailed in Sec. V B, the phase spaces covered by Type-I and Type-II events are complementary. In particular, the inclusion of Type-II events extends the p T upper limit for analysis from 0.6 GeV in the previous analyses to 1.0 GeV.  The \u03c0 0 event selection criteria that are applied prior to the reconstruction of the \u03c0 0 kinematics are summarized in Table I. Type-I events accompanied by at least one additional background particle in one of the two calorimeters (usually a photon or a neutron) and not originating in a \u03c0 0 decay are denoted as multihit \u03c0 0 events and are rejected as background events. Similarly, Type-II events accompanied by at least one additional background particle in the calorimeter used for \u03c0 0 identification are rejected. Figure 3 shows diagrams of all types of multihit events that are rejected. Panels (a) and (b) show the multihit Type-I \u03c0 0 events, and panels (c) and (d) show the multihit Type-II \u03c0 0 events. Red and green arrows indicate a background particle not originating in a \u03c0 0 decay and two photons originating in a \u03c0 0 decay, respectively.

The model consists of an asymmetric Gaussian distribution for the \u03c0 0 signal component and a third-order Chebyshev polynomial function for the background component. The fit is performed over the two-photon invariant mass range 0.08 < M \u03b3\u03b3 < 0.18 GeV. The \u03c0 0 signal window is defined by the two dashed vertical lines in Fig. 2 that are placed AE3\u03c3 from the mean value. Here, the mean value and the standard deviation are obtained from the best-fit asymmetric Gaussian distribution. The background window is defined as the region within AE6\u03c3 distance from the peak value and excluding the \u03c0 0 signal window. The fraction of the  background component included in the \u03c0 0 signal window can be estimated using the ratio of the integral of the best-fit third-order Chebyshev function over the \u03c0 0 signal window divided by the integral over the \u03c0 0 signal and background windows.

The acceptance efficiency has been obtained by taking the ratio of the p z -p T distribution of \u03c0 0 s that are within the aperture of the LHCf calorimeters divided by the distribution of all simulated \u03c0 0 s. The fiducial cuts [18] and reconstructed energy cut (both of the \u03c0 0 decay photons must have E > 100 GeV) are also applied to the accepted \u03c0 0 events. Dashed curves in Fig. 4 indicate lines of constant \u03c0 0 rapidity. The acceptance efficiencies in Fig. 4 are purely kinematic and do not depend upon a particular hadronic interaction model. The aperture correction is achieved by dividing, point by point, the distributions before the acceptance correction by the acceptance efficiency. The branching ratio inefficiency is due to \u03c0 0 decay into channels other than two photons. The branching ratio for \u03c0 0 decay into two photons is 98.8% and is taken into account by increasing the \u03c0 0 acceptance efficiency by 1.2%.",

The second component is a dependence of the unfolding procedure on the event generator used in the generation of the response matrix for unfolding, which is negligible as we mentioned in Sec. IVA. Finally, the third component is the systematic uncertainty in the unfolding algorithm itself. This is evaluated by comparing two unfolded distributions, one obtained by a fully Bayesian unfolding method and the second obtained by the iterative Bayesian unfolding method. The uncertainty in the first component is 10% over the all p T and p z bins, and the uncertainties in the other two components make no significant contribution.

The 68% confidence intervals incorporating the statistical and systematic uncertainties, except for the luminosity uncertainty, are indicated by the error bars. LHCf p T distributions are corrected for the influences of the detector response, event selection efficiencies, and geometrical acceptance efficiencies, and thus LHCf p T distributions can be compared directly to the predicted p T distributions from hadronic interaction models. For comparison, the predictions from various hadronic interaction models are also shown in Fig. 5: DPMJET (solid red line), QGSJET (dashed blue line), SIBYLL (dotted green line), EPOS (dashed-dotted magenta line), and PYTHIA (default parameter set, dashed-doubledotted brown line). For these hadronic interaction models, the inelastic cross section used for the production rate normalization is taken from the predefined value in each model. Figure 6 presents the ratios of the inclusive production rates predicted by the hadronic interaction models listed above to those obtained by LHCf data. Shaded areas have been taken from the statistical and systematic uncertainties. In Fig. 6, the denominator and the numerators, namely the inclusive production rate for LHCf data and for the hadronic interaction models, respectively, are properly normalized by the inelastic cross section for each, and thus we do not apply any other normalization to the ratios.

These two models are based on the parton-based Gribov-Regge approach [55,56] and are tuned by using the present LHC data (ALICE, ATLAS, CMS, and TOTEM) [32,34]. The prediction of SIBYLL agrees well with the LHCf data for 8.8 < y < 9.2 and p T < 0.4 GeV, while the absolute yield of SIBYLL is about half that of the LHCf data for y > 9.2. The predictions of DPMJET and PYTHIA are compatible with LHCf data for 9.0 < y < 9.8 and p T < 0.2 GeV, while for p T > 0.2 GeV they become significantly harder than both LHCf data and the other model predictions. Generally, the harder distributions appearing in SIBYLL, DPMJET, and PYTHIA can be attributed to the baryon/meson production mechanism that is used by these models. For example, the popcorn approach [57,58] implemented in the Lund model is known to produce hard distributions of forward mesons [59]. Indeed, by only changing the tuning parameters of the popcorn approach in DPMJET, one obtains softer meson distributions and consequently p T distributions that are compatible with LHCf data. However, such a crude tune may bring disagreements between the model predictions and other experimental results, e.g., forward neutron p z and p T distributions.",

The high-p T tail that extends beyond the data (p T \u226b hp T i) has a negligible contribution to hp T i.

Here, we note that a parton (dominantly gluon) density rapidly increases with decreasing x Bj when x Bj < 0.01 with the target approaching the blackbody limit where the gluon density is saturated. In the blackbody regime, the partons cannot go through the target nuclear medium without interaction and suffer transverse momenta transfers proportional to the saturation momentum scale Q s . The Q s values in the very forward region are \u223c1 GeV in p \u00fe p collisions and \u223c10 GeV in p \u00fe Pb collisions, although the calculation of Q s itself suffers from both theoretical and experimental uncertainties and is also dependent on the impact parameter of the colliding hadrons [15].",

The uncertainty of the absolute normalization is estimated to be AE15% according to the discussion in Sec. VII B and is taken into account in the interpolated normalization. Finally, the p T distributions at ffiffi ffi s p \u00bc 5.02 TeV are produced by assuming that the p T distribution follows either a Gaussian distribution or a Hagedorn function and by using the hp T i values obtained in the first step and the normalization obtained in the second step. The difference of the p T distribution produced using a Gaussian distribution or a Hagedorn function gives the systematic uncertainty. Note that the rapidity shift \u22120.465 explained in Sec. III B is also taken into account for the p T distribution in p \u00fe p collisions at ffiffi ffi s p \u00bc 5.02 TeV. Figure 23 shows the nuclear modification factors R pPb obtained from LHCf data and the predictions from the hadronic interaction models, DPMJET  The average values of p T , denoted hp T i, at y > 8.8 in p \u00fe p collisions and at y lab > 8.8 in p \u00fe Pb collisions, were calculated using the LHCf p T distributions. The hp T i values obtained have been shown to be independent of the center-of-mass energy at the 10% level. Tests of limiting fragmentation and Feynman scaling hypotheses using LHCf data in p \u00fe p collisions show that both hypotheses hold in the forward region at the 15%-20% level. The leading exponent \u03b1 and the nuclear modification factor R pPb derived from LHCf data indicate a strong suppression of \u03c0 0 production from the nuclear target relative to that from the nucleon target. Within the uncertainties, all of the hadronic interaction models presented gave an overall good agreement with R pPb estimated by LHCf data. According to the analysis in this paper, we expect that the number of particles leading to an electromagnetic component in air showers would follow the limiting rapidity distribution and Feynman scaling hypotheses. Combining the results for forward \u03c0 0 s in this paper with the recent results for forward neutrons in Ref. [70] strongly constrains models for air-shower production at the TeV scale.",
