            "text": "Efficient treatment of systematic uncertainties that depend on a large number of nuisance parameters is a persistent difficulty in particle physics experiments. Where low-level effects are not amenable to simple parameterization or re-weighting, analyses often rely on discrete simulation sets to quantify the effects of nuisance parameters on key analysis observables. Such methods may become computationally untenable for analyses requiring high statistics Monte Carlo with a large number of nuisance degrees of freedom, especially in cases where these degrees of freedom parameterize the shape of a continuous distribution. In this paper we present a method for treating systematic uncertainties in a computationally efficient and comprehensive manner using a single simulation set with multiple and continuously varied nuisance parameters. This method is demonstrated for the case of the depth-dependent effective dust distribution within the IceCube Neutrino Telescope.",

            "text": "A pervasive challenge in experimental particle physics is the development of robust treatments for systematic uncertainties. There is no single correct approach to treating systematic uncertainties in any analysis, but it is nevertheless recognized that a credible parameterization of ignorance about the experiment being undertaken is a critical ingredient in any measurement. Furthermore, for analyses yielding unified confidence intervals or Bayesian intervals in multi-dimensional spaces, neither an overly tight nor an overly loose parameterization of ignorance can generally be considered to be conservative -either may enhance the likelihood of a spurious signal or overly strong exclusion under certain circumstances, and so it is vital to parameterize ignorance as accurately as possible. Given that no parameterization of uncertainty is exact, and that un-modelled effects and simplifying assumptions will always be present, treatment of systematic uncertainties is be a frequent source of difficulty in particle physics and beyond. The goal of this work is to present a method used at the IceCube South Pole Neutrino Observatory [1,2] to propagate a particularly complex form of systematic uncertainty from calibration constraints to analyses of atmospheric neutrinos, including searches for sterile neutrinos [3]. The uncertainty in question is that of the effective dust concentration as a function of depth within the ice of the IceCube neutrino telescope. For the purpose of this work, the term \"dust\" will be used to refer to all forms of optical impurity within the ice, although mineral dust itself is only one major component.",

The latest generation of atmospheric neutrino analyses at IceCube, on the other hand, consider samples containing more than 250,000 muon neutrino candidates [12].

It has long been established that the ice has properties that are depth dependent and correlate with the climate history on Earth over the period of its accumulation, of approximately 100,000 years [13,14]. The primary optical effects that influence photon propagation are absorption and scattering, and these are observed to exhibit a strong depth dependent correlation with one-another, suggesting a common origin. This origin is generally understood to be small concentrations of dust throughout the array. Since the dust concentration is very low, the dust distribution is best probed via its effects on light propagation, using both dedicated dust-logger devices [14] and in-situ calibration using LED flashers within the IceCube array [4]. Based on this calibration data, a layered ice optical model has been constructed, with absorption and scattering coefficients assigned for each 10m layer, their values continuing to be refined as understanding of the ice properties improves through evolving calibration techniques and the incorporation of increasingly comprehensive catalogues of optical effects. The structure and tuning of the ice model is described at length elsewhere, and a detailed exposition of its construction is outside the scope of this work. The absorption and scattering coefficients from a recent generation of IceCube ice model are shown in Fig 3, as well as an example of a perturbed model illustrating the continuous freedom in these parameters which must be explored to properly account for its uncertainty.",

We do not treat here the uncertainty on the form or composition of dust (i.e. the possibility that some areas of dust could create more absorption and less scattering, for example), uncertainty on the source and form of optical anisotropy [9], uncertainty on the properties of refrozen ice in the vicinity of the Digital Optical Modules, or other possible sources of un-modeled uncertainty. The resulting uncertainty estimate should thus not be considered as a comprehensive uncertainty budget for all IceCube optical effects, or as a strong statement about glaciology.

This method is fundamentally restricted in its ability to accurately assess depth-dependent contributions to systematic uncertainty. One possibility would be to vary individual layers one by one, and consider the scale of these variations as entries in the \u03b7 vector. However, it is clear that varying only a single layer can have at most a very modest effect on the distribution of analysis variables such as reconstructed energy when integrated over the full sample of detected events. The ice model variants of most interest, which may strongly impact analysis outcomes, are those where correlated shifts in the ice model are made over certain larger regions of the detector. These could be accounted for with a layer-by-layer variation protocol, given a suitably derived correlated covariance matrix for \u03b7. This would require many thousands of independent parameter constrains to be derived from flasher data, two for each layer and their covariances, and very strong local anti-correlations would be expected.",

A fully covariant constraint on \u03b7 derived in Fourier space would yield an equivalent uncertainty envelope to one derived in depth space. However, the benefit of Fourier space is that it offers a natural ordering principle to select the most important uncertainty contributions. Low frequency Fourier modes have large amplitudes, and their variation reflects macroscopic changes over large regions of the IceCube detector. These are expected to contribute the dominant parts of analysis-space uncertainties. The high frequency modes, on the other hand, have smaller amplitudes and their variation is expected to have a minimal effect in analysis space, since the effect of the fast-varying ice properties effectively cancels when integrating over the detector and accounting for resolution effects.

The diagonal 1\u03c3 widths for the leading Fourier amplitudes and phases from IceCube flasher data and the full Hessian matrix M normalized to these values are shown in Fig. 6. The relevance of the correlation terms is well illustrated by considering the envelope of allowed perturbed models in depth space. Fig. 7 shows the envelope of allowed correlated variations within the measured covariace matrix, both including off-diagonal correlation terms (top), and treating each mode as independent (bottom). Red lines mark the edges of frequentist envelopes containing 68%, 95% and 99% of sampled models at each depth. The emergence of regions of high uncertainty outside of the detector volume, and in the strongly absorbing \"dust layer\" that is known to reside at around -100m in IceCube coordinates, are only manifest when nuisance parameter correlations are properly accounted for. This demonstrates a case where the often overlooked correlations between nuisance parameters constrained by common calibration data are crucial for properly encoding physical features of the underlying detector model. The envelope described above was generated with a zero-to-four mode model (9 nuisance parameters), which limits the sharpness of features in the depth envelope. The choice of a fourth-mode cut-off is motivated in Sec. 3.3 in the context of the IceCube atmospheric neutrino sample, where modes above the fourth are shown to have a rapidly diminishing effect on the analysis distributions within flasher-constrained uncertainty. Because the size of the envelope in Fig. 7 depends on the high frequency cutoff, caution should be exercised against over-interpreting as an absolute statement of dust uncertainty vs depth. In principle, very high frequency modes are neither constrained by flasher calibration nor relevant for the atmospheric neutrino sample, and so any envelope so constructed relies on some notion of smoothness or regularization. Our goal here is not to construct a measurement of dust concentration vs. depth, but rather to map the physically important constraints on low frequency modes from calibration data to analysis space, and it is the effect of these modes only that is encoded in Fig. 7. Figure 7. Fractional excursions arising from multiple sampling of 5,000 models. The largest excursion are allowed in regions where the properties of the ice are poorly constrained, such as outside the detector and in the dust layer. Note that this structure is embodied in the correlations between nuisance parameters, rather than their individual spreads -this can be seen by comparing the correlated sampling approach (top) using full covariance matrix with an uncorrelated sampling (bottom).",

Using a perturbative treatment of nuisance parameters, construction of a single Monte Carlo ensemble with randomly distributed nuisance variables allows for construction of predictions given generic nuisance vectors. The nuisance gradients extracted can then be combined with constraints in the nuisance space derived from calibration data. The power of this approach lies in the fact that only a single Monte Carlo ensemble is required for treatment of uncertainties describable by an in principle arbitrarily large number of nuisance parameters. As an example case, an application of the SnowStorm method to IceCube atmospheric neutrino analyses was described. There, a class of bulk ice optical uncertainties related to depth-dependent effective dust concentration within the IceCube array was propagated from LED calibration data to the analysis space of the energy distributions of atmospheric neutrinos. This application is especially illustrative of the power of this method, since it involves a large number of nuisance parameters that have physically important correlations in their calibration constraints, mapped to analysis covariance via a single Monte Carlo ensemble. This method is being used by forthcoming high statistics IceCube analyses, and may find wider utility for treating complicated systematic uncertainties, both within IceCube and beyond. ",
