            "text": "An intriguing feature of these observations is that they suggest the existence of a WIMP dark matter particle belonging to a secluded gauge sector under which the Standard Model (SM) particles are uncharged [9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18]. An abelian gauge field, the U boson with mass near the GeV scale, couples the secluded sector to the SM through its kinetic mixing with the SM hypercharge gauge field. The kinetic mixing parameter, \u01eb, can naturally be of the order 10 \u22124 -10 \u22122 . In a very minimal scenario, in addition to the U , it is natural to have a secluded Higgs boson, the h \u2032 , which spontaneously breaks the secluded gauge symmetry. A consequence of the above hypotheses is that observable effects can be induced in O(GeV)-energy e + e \u2212 colliders [19,20,21,22,23,24] and fixed target experiments [25,26,27,28].",

From 2000 to 2006, KLOE collected 2.5 fb \u22121 of collisions at the \u03c6 meson peak and about 240 pb \u22121 below the \u03c6 resonance ( \u221a s = 1 GeV). The \u03c6 meson predominantly decays into charged and neutral kaons, thus allowing KLOE to make precision studies in the fields of flavor physics, low energy QCD and test of discrete symmetries [29]. A new beam crossing scheme allowing a reduced beam size and increased luminosity is operating at DA\u03a6NE [30]. The KLOE-2 detector was successfully installed in this new interaction region and has been upgraded with small angle tagging devices to detect both high and low energy electrons or positrons in e + e \u2212 \u2192 e + e \u2212 X events. About 5 fb \u22121 are expected in the first year of running. An inner tracker and small angle calorimeters are scheduled to be installed in a subsequent step, providing larger acceptance both for charged particles and photons. A detailed description of the KLOE-2 physics program can be found in Ref. [31].",

The position resolutions are \u03c3 xy \u223c 150 \u00b5m and \u03c3 z \u223c 2 mm. The momentum resolution is \u03c3(p \u22a5 )/p \u22a5 \u2248 0.4%. Vertexes are reconstructed with a spatial resolution of \u223c 3 mm. The calorimeter [33] is divided into a barrel and two endcaps and covers 98% of the solid angle. The modules are read out at both ends by photomultipliers with a readout granularity of \u223c (4.4 \u00d7 4.4) cm 2 . The arrival times of particles and the positions in three dimensions of the energy deposits are obtained from the signals collected at the two ends. Cells close in time and space are grouped into a calorimeter cluster. The cluster energy E is the sum of the cell energies. The cluster time T and position R are energy weighted averages.

The mass of the U and h \u2032 are both free parameters, and the possible decay channels can be very different depending on which particle is heavier. In both cases, an interesting production channel is the h \u2032 -strahlung, e + e \u2212 \u2192 U h \u2032 [19]. Assuming the h \u2032 to be lighter than the U boson, it turns out to be very long-lived, so that the signature process will be a lepton pair, generated by the U boson decay, plus missing energy. In the case m h \u2032 > m U , the dark higgs frequently decays to a pair of real or virtual U 's. In this case one can observe events with 6 leptons in the final state, due to the h \u2032 -strahlung process, or 4 leptons and a photon, due to the e + e \u2212 \u2192 h \u2032 \u03b3 reaction.",

A cut 535 < M miss (ee) < 560 MeV is then applied. A residual background contamination, due to \u03c6 \u2192 \u03b7\u03b3 events with photon conversion on beam pipe (BP) or drift chamber walls (DCW), is rejected by tracking back to BP/DCW surfaces the two e + , e \u2212 candidates and then reconstructing the electron-positron invariant mass (M ee ) and the distance between the two particles (D ee ). Both quantities are small if coming from photon conversion. \u03c6 \u2192 KK and \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 events surviving analysis cuts have more than two pions in the final state. They are rejected using time-of-flight to the calorimeter. When an EMC cluster is connected to a track, the arrival time to the calorimeter is evaluated both with calorimeter (T cluster ) and drift chamber (T track ) information. Events with an e + , e \u2212 candidate outside a 3 \u03c3's window on the DT = T track \u2212T cluster variables are rejected. In Fig. 1-right the M ee distribution evaluated at IP for data at different steps of the analysis is shown. The conversion and ToF cuts remove events at low and high invariant mass values respectively. In Fig. 2 the comparison between data and Monte Carlo (MC) events for M ee and cos \u03c8 * distributions is shown. The second variable is the angle between the \u03b7 and the e + in the e + e \u2212 rest frame.

The MC description of these kind of events is done using Vector Meson Dominance, and the form factor slope parameter is taken from the measurement of SND experiment, obtained with 213 events [34].

M recoil is evaluated using the center of mass energy of each run measured with Bhabha scattering events and the momenta of the muons. Continuum background, which can be further reduced tuning the \u03c0/\u00b5 identification algorithm, is concentrated in the band at M \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 > 700 MeV. The \u03c6 \u2192 K + K \u2212 channel covers a wider region of the plane (M \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 < 600 MeV, M recoil < 300 MeV). This background, having only two muons in the final state and missing energy due to neutrinos, has the same signature of the signal. The efficiency for e + e \u2212 \u2192 U h \u2032 events is 15-40%, depending on m U , m h \u2032 masses. Taking into account the total integrated luminosity, a signal would show up as a sharp peak with \u2264 10 events in the M recoil -M \u00b5\u00b5 plane for \u01eb \u223c 10 \u22123 .  Being the \u03c6 \u2192 K + K \u2212 background a nasty background source, we repeated the analysis using the off-peak sample, 0.2 fb \u22121 taken at center of mass energy of 1 GeV. As can be seen in Fig. 5-right, the contribution from resonant background is not present anymore, providing a much cleaner sample for the search of e + e \u2212 \u2192 U h \u2032 candidates.",
