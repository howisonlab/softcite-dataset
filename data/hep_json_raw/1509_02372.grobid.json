            "text": "The effective theory of non-relativistic QCD (NRQCD) [1,2] provides the foundation for much of the current theoretical work. According to NRQCD, the production of heavy quarkonium factorises into two steps: a heavy quark-antiquark pair is first created at short distances, and subsequently evolves non-perturbatively into a quarkonium state. The NRQCD calculations include the colour-singlet (CS) and colour-octet (CO) matrix elements for the pertubative stage. The CS model [3,4], which provides a leading-order description of quarkonium production, underestimates the cross-section for single J/\u03c8 production at the Tevatron [5] at high p T , where p T is the component of the meson momentum transverse to the beam. To resolve this discrepancy, the CO mechanism was introduced [6]. The corresponding matrix elements were determined from the high-p T data, as the CO cross-section decreases more slowly with p T than that predicted by the CS model. More recent higher-order calculations [7][8][9][10][11] show better agreement between CS predictions and the experimental data [12], reducing the need for large CO contributions. The production of \u03a5 mesons in proton-proton (pp) collisions can occur either directly in parton scattering or via feed down from the decay of heavier bottomonium states, such as \u03c7 b [13][14][15][16][17][18], or higher-mass \u03a5 states, which complicates the theoretical description of bottomonium production [19,20].",

The existing LHCb measurements of these quantities were performed at \u221a s = 7 TeV with a data sample collected in 2010 corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 25 pb \u22121 , and at \u221a s = 8 TeV for early 2012 data using 50 pb \u22121 . Both measurements were differential in p T and y of the \u03a5 mesons in the ranges 2.0 < y < 4.5 and p T < 15 GeV/c. Based on these measurements, an increase of the production cross-section in excess of 30% between \u221a s = 7 and 8 TeV was observed, which is larger than the increase observed for other quarkonium states such as the J/\u03c8 [23,28] and larger than the expectations from NRQCD [11].",

The detector includes a high-precision tracking system consisting of a silicon-strip vertex detector surrounding the pp interaction region, a large-area silicon-strip detector located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4 Tm, and three stations of silicon-strip detectors and straw drift tubes placed downstream of the magnet. The tracking system provides a measurement of momentum, p, of charged particles with a relative uncertainty that varies from 0.5% at low momentum to 1.0% at 200 GeV/c. The minimum distance of a track to a primary vertex, the impact parameter, is measured with a resolution of (15 + 29/p T ) \u00b5m, where p T is in GeV/c. Different types of charged hadrons are distinguished using information from two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors. Photons, electrons and hadrons are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter and a hadronic calorimeter. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers [31]. The online event selection is performed by a trigger [32], which consists of a hardware stage, based on information from the calorimeter and muon systems, followed by a software stage, which applies a full event reconstruction. At the hardware stage, events for this analysis are selected by requiring dimuon candidates with a product of their p T values exceeding 1.7 (2.6) (GeV/c) 2 for data collected at \u221a s = 7 (8) TeV. In the subsequent software trigger, two well-reconstructed tracks are required to have hits in the muon system, p T > 500 MeV/c, p > 6 GeV/c and to form a common vertex. Only events with a dimuon candidate with a mass m \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 > 4.7 GeV/c 2 are retained for further analysis. In the offline selection, trigger decisions are associated with reconstructed particles. Se-",

The results for the reduced range are consistent with the previous measurements, confirming the increase of the bottomonium production cross-section of approximately 30% when the centre-of-mass energy increases from \u221a s = 7 to 8 TeV [22,23]. The ratios R 8/7 as a function of p T integrated over the region 2.0 < y < 4.5 are shown in figure 5a. The ratios are fitted with a linear function. The fit quality is good, with a pvalue exceeding 35% for all cases, and the slopes are found to be 10.8 \u00b1 0.6, 9.5 \u00b1 1.2 and 9.8 \u00b1 1.6 (in units of 10 \u22123 / (GeV/c)) for \u03a5(1S), \u03a5(2S) and \u03a5(3S), respectively. The measurements are compared with the NRQCD theory predictions [11] in the same kinematic range, where only uncertainties from the CO long distance matrix elements are considered since most other uncertainties are expected to cancel in the ratio. The theory predictions are independent on the \u03a5 state and are consistently lower than the measurements.",
