Recent results for the hadron programme comprise highlights from different topics. A selective overview is given and, among others, the following results are discussed. The precise determination of the pion polarisability, a long standing puzzle that has been solved now, is presented as well as measurements of radiative widths. The observation of a new narrow axial-vector state, the a 1 (1420), as well as deeper insights into the exotic 1 \u2212+ -wave, which is under study since decades by several experiments, are discussed and further, the search for the charmonium-like exotic Z c (3900) state in the COMPASS data is covered.",

In the corresponding \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b3 \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b3 scattering process, the polarisabilities manifest as a deviation from the Born cross-section of a point-like particle.

The fits to the data are shown in Fig. 4, from which a width of \u0393 0 (a 2 (1320) \u2192 \u03c0\u03b3) = (358\u00b16\u00b142) keV and \u0393 0 (\u03c0 2 (1670) \u2192 \u03c0\u03b3) = (181\u00b111\u00b127) keV have been measured for the a 2 (1320) and the \u03c0 2 (1670), respectively. Both results are consistent with predictions based on the VMD model [8]. Compared to previous measurements, the COMPASS result for \u0393 0 (a 2 (1320) \u2192 \u03c0\u03b3) is the most precise one, whereas for \u0393 0 (\u03c0 2 (1670) \u2192 \u03c0\u03b3) the COMPASS result is the first measurement at all.",

The data has been divided into 11 and 8 bins of t such that about equal statistics is contained in each bin, and (as previously) into 20 MeV/c 2 and 40 MeV/c 2 wide m 3\u03c0 bins for the charged and the neutral mode data, respectively. The first step analysis, the so-called massindependent PWA, is carried out independently for each mass bin and independently for the different ranges of t . This maximum likelihood (rank-1) fit of the model to the data extracts the production amplitudes, taking into account the detector acceptance. Finally, the analysis is completed by the second step analysis, the so-called mass-dependent fit. In this \u03c7 2 fit of Breit-Wigner amplitudes to a subset of the spin density matrix, resonance parameters are extracted, for which not only the intensities but also the interferences are taken into account. Also it takes into account the observed t dependencies by performing a simultaneous optimisation of the resonant parameters in all t regions.   Figure 6. Top: First step PWA result, charged versus neutral decay mode [14]: The fitted intensity for the 1 ++ 0 + f 0 (980) \u03c0 P-wave shows a narrow structure at about 1.4 GeV/c 2 , it is similarly observed for both, neutral and charged (3\u03c0) \u2212 mode (left). In the resultant intensity for the 4 ++ 1 + \u03c1(770) \u03c0 G-wave, the known a 4 (2040) is similarly observed (centre). The relative phase of the two shows a clean rapid phase motion in the signal region. Bottom: Second step PWA result, charged decay mode [18]: Complete fit result in terms of the resultant 1 ++ 0 + f 0 (980) \u03c0 P intensity (incoherent sum over t' ranges) (left), the first step result is given by the black data points and the resonance model fit overlaid in red consists of the BW describing the narrow structure, that we call the a 1 (1420) (blue curve), and the non-resonant background contribution (green curve). The corresponding result is shown for the a 4 (2040) observed in the 4 ++ 1 + \u03c1(770) \u03c0 G-wave (centre). The relative phase of the a 1 (1420) against the a 4 (2040) (right) is shown for three different t' ranges, consistently showing a clean rapid phase rotation in the signal region. Figure 6 (top/left) shows the first step PWA result for one out of the 87 partial waves, namely the 1 ++ 0 + f 0 (980)\u03c0 P-wave, in terms of the fitted intensity for both decay modes. Indeed, the incoherent sum over the different t' ranges is shown here, and the charged is normalised to the neutral mode data using the integral. Good agreement on the fit result is found for the two channels. For both decay modes, the 1 ++ 0 + f 0 (980)\u03c0 P-wave intensity, containing only a very small fraction of the total observed intensity of about 0.25 % [18], shows a clear signal slightly above 1.4 GeV/c 2 . Rapid phase rotations with respect to known resonances, like e.g. the a 4 (2040) (Fig. 6, top/centre), are observed in the signal region ( Fig. 6, top/right), as it is expected for a resonance. A phase does not depend on the amount of amplitude, and the phase motion is observed independent of t .",

It shows a clean phase motion against well-known resonances and is consistent with the disputed \u03c0 1 (1600) [20]. The high statistics of the 2008 proton target data allows the search for exotic states in different decay modes in the same experiment [11]. Employing the same PWA method as in [20], the results obtained for the (1 \u2212+ )1 + \u03c1 \u2212 \u03c0 0 and (1 \u2212+ )1 + \u03c1 0 \u03c0 \u2212 intensity and relative phase are similar and consistent with the previous observations [12,13]. Apart of the established resonances a 1 (1260), a 2 (1320), \u03c0 2 (1670), also \u03c0(1800) and a 4 (2040), an exotic signal in the 1 \u2212+ wave at around 1.6 GeV/c 2 has been observed, that shows a clean phase motion with respect to well-known resonances. These results are consistently obtained for both \u03c1\u03c0 decay modes, neutral and charged. The extension to an additional t binning and performing the PWA independently also in different ranges of t [17] allows for disentangling resonant from non-resonant particle production (e.g. dynamically produced components caused by the Deck effect [21]  Figure 8. First step PWA result for the intensity of the exotic 1 \u2212+ 1 + \u03c1(770) \u03c0 P-wave for the charged decay mode (blue) overlaid with a projection of a simulated Deck-effect in this wave (green), shown for the range of lowest (left) and highest (right) values of t [16].",

In order to further investigate this explanation, pseudo data were generated according to a dedicated model [22]. This data has been analysed as the real data, including the decomposition into partial waves, in order to study the Deck-amplitude contribution to the different partial waves included in the PWA. Figure 8 shows the promising outcome of the study for the exotic 1 \u2212+ partial wave, exemplary for the ranges of smallest and largest t for the charged decay mode. The Deck amplitude intensities are normalised to the total intensity (summed over all mass and t bins) in the given wave. A large part of the exotic 1 \u2212+ wave intensity at small values of t can be described as a contribution by the non-resonant Deck process (Fig. 8, left), whereas the contribution at large t is almost negligible according to this ansatz.",

It shows a rapid phase motion with respect to established resonances. The extension to a t -resolved partial-wave analysis provides deeper understanding of the exotic signal that we observe at around 1.6 GeV/c 2 in the 1 \u2212+ 1 + \u03c1(770)\u03c0 P wave, showing resonant behaviour. The intensity observed at small momentum transfers t seems to a large extent to be attributed to contributions from the Deck effect, whereas merely a negligible Deck contribution seems to play a role at larger values of t . Deeper insights on the disputed \u03c0 1 (1600) hybrid candidate are not only gained via the two (3\u03c0) \u2212 decay channels but also in the \u03b7\u03c0 and \u03b7 \u03c0 channels. As an outlook, the 2012 Primakoff data set with considerably larger statistics will further improve the pion polarisability measurement. Thanks to the extended x \u03b3 range, also a measurement of (\u03b1 \u03c0 +\u03b2 \u03c0 ) will be feasible, also a first measurement of the kaon polarisability is foreseen. For spectroscopy, the analysis of (5\u03c0) \u2212 , (\u03b7\u03b7\u03c0) \u2212 and also ( f 1 \u03c0) \u2212 will allow for access towards higher masses, and complete the list of channels for spin-exotic search.",
