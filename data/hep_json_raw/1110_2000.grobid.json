            "text": "Charge-Parity (CP ) violation plays an important role in any explanation of the observed dominance of matter over antimatter in our Universe. Current experimental knowledge about CP violation is limited. Charmless hadronic B decays constitute sensitive probes for CP violation in the standard model (SM) as well as beyond, and can help to further elucidate this unsolved question. In the SM, the decays B \u00b1 \u2192 \u03b7 (\u2032) K \u00b1 and B 0 \u2192 \u03b7 (\u2032) K 0 are expected to primarily proceed through b \u2192 s penguin processes and a b \u2192 u tree transition as shown in Fig. 1. The large B \u2192 \u03b7 \u2032 K [1][2][3] and small B \u2192 \u03b7K [3,4] branching fractions can be explained by \u03b7 \u2212 \u03b7 \u2032 mixing along with constructive and destructive interference between the amplitudes of the two penguin processes [5,6].",

We use event topology variables to distinguish spherically distributed BB events from the jet-like continuum background. First we combine a set of modified Fox-Wolfram moments [19] into a Fisher discriminant. We then compute a likelihood from the product of probability density functions (PDFs) that describe the Fisher discriminant, cos \u03b8 * B , and \u2206z distributions. Here, \u03b8 * B is the angle between the B flight direction and the beam direction in the \u03a5(4S) rest frame, and \u2206z is the decay flight-length difference, along the z axis, between vertices of the signal B and the accompany-",

The fitting systematic uncertainties due to the signal PDF modeling are estimated from changes of the fit parameters while varying the calibration factors by one standard deviation.

The possible detector bias due to the tracking acceptance and R(K/\u03c0) selection for A CP (B \u00b1 \u2192 \u03b7\u03c0 \u00b1 ) is evaluated using the fitted A CP value of the continuum background [26,27].
