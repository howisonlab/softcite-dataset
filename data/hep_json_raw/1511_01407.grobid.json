Excited leptons ( * ) produced via contact interactions in conjunction with a standard model lepton are considered, and a search is made for their gauge decay modes. The decays considered are * \u2192 \u03b3 and * \u2192 Z, which give final states of two leptons and a photon or, depending on the Z-boson decay mode, four leptons or two leptons and two jets. The number of events observed in data is consistent with the standard model prediction. Exclusion limits are set on the excited lepton mass, and the compositeness scale \u039b. For the case M * = \u039b the existence of excited electrons (muons) is excluded up to masses of 2.45 (2.47) TeV at 95% confidence level. Neutral current decays of excited leptons are considered for the first time, and limits are extended to include the possibility that the weight factors f and f , which determine the couplings between standard model leptons and excited leptons via gauge mediated interactions, have opposite sign.",

Attempts to explain the observed hierarchy have led to a class of models postulating that quarks and leptons may be composite objects of fundamental constituents [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9]. The fundamental constituents are bound by an asymptotically free gauge interaction that becomes strong at a characteristic scale \u039b. Compositeness models predict the existence of excited states of quarks (q * ) and leptons ( * ) at the characteristic scale of the new binding interaction. Since these excited fermions couple to the ordinary SM fermions, they could be produced via contact interactions (CI) in collider experiments, with subsequent decay to ordinary fermions through the emission of a W/Z/\u03b3 boson, or via CI to other fermions.",

            "text": "The central feature of the CMS apparatus is a superconducting solenoid of 6 m internal diameter, providing a magnetic field of 3.8 T. Within the superconducting solenoid volume are a silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL), and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter (HCAL), each composed of a barrel and two endcap sections. Forward calorimeters extend the pseudorapidity (\u03b7) [27] coverage provided by the barrel and endcap detectors. Muons are measured in gas-ionization detectors embedded in the steel flux-return yoke outside the solenoid. In the barrel section of the ECAL, an energy resolution of about 1% is achieved for unconverted or late-converting photons in the tens of GeV energy range. The remaining barrel photons have a resolution of about 1.3% up to |\u03b7| = 1, rising to about 2.5% at |\u03b7| = 1.4. In the endcaps, the resolution of unconverted or late-converting photons is about 2.5%, while the remaining endcap photons have a resolution between 3 and 4% [28]. When combining information from the entire detector, the jet energy resolution amounts typically to 15% at 10 GeV, 8% at 100 GeV, and 4% at 1 TeV, to be compared to about 40%, 12%, and 5% obtained when the ECAL and HCAL calorimeters alone are used. The electron momentum is determined by combining the energy measurement in the ECAL with the momentum measurement in the tracker. The momentum resolution for electrons with p T \u2248 45 GeV from Z \u2192 ee decays ranges from 1.7% for non-showering electrons in the barrel region to 4.5% for showering electrons in the endcaps [29]. Muons are identified in the range |\u03b7| < 2.4, with detection planes made using three technologies: drift tubes, cathode strip chambers, and resistive plate chambers. Matching muons to tracks measured in the silicon tracker results in a relative p T resolution for muons with 20 < p T < 100 GeV of 1.3-2.0% in the barrel and better than 6% in the endcaps. The p T resolution in the barrel is better than 10% for muons with p T up to 1 TeV [30].

The deposited energy should be predominantely in the electromagnetic calorimeter. Thus a lower limit is set on the ratio H/E where H stands for the energy deposited in the hadronic calorimeter and E for that in the electromagnetic calorimeter. These candidates must be within the barrel or endcap fiducial regions with |\u03b7| < 1.44 or 1.56 < |\u03b7| < 2.50, respectively and have a p T > 35 GeV (25 GeV in the 4 -searches). A set of identification requirements that are optimized for electrons with high transverse momenta [31], based on the profile of the energy deposition in the ECAL and the matching between the track and the cluster, are imposed to remove jets misidentified as electrons.

In computing the tracker isolation for electrons, tracks have to originate from within a distance |d z | < 0.2 cm from the primary vertex. This requirement reduces the impact of pileup interactions vetoing candidate events. The sum of the transverse energy (E T ) of calorimeter energy deposits in the same cone, referred to as \"calorimeter isolation\", must be less than 3% of the candidate's transverse energy. The calorimeter isolation energy is corrected for pileup by the subtraction of the average energy per unit area of (\u03b7, \u03c6), computed for each event using the FastJet package [32].",

A photon candidate is required to have a cluster with E T > 35 GeV and to be in the barrel region of the ECAL, with |\u03b7| < 1.44. Photons are required to be in the central region because the jet-to-photon fake rate becomes high in the forward region, while only 4% of a signal would lie in this region. The photon is also required to be isolated within a cone of radius \u2206R < 0.3 both in the tracker and the calorimeter. The cone axis is taken to be the direction of the line joining the barycenter of the ECAL clusters to the primary vertex. The isolation criteria depend on the \u03b7 of the photon, and distinguish between contributions from neutral and charged hadrons and electromagnetic particles. As with the electron isolation calculation, the sums do not include contributions from particles clearly associated with pileup vertices, and are adjusted for the estimated residual pileup.",

Charged PF constituents not associated to the primary vertex are not used in the jet clustering procedure. Good PF candidates are clustered into jets using the Cambridge-Aachen (CA) algorithm [35] with a distance parameter R = 0.8. An area-based correction is applied, to take into account the extra energy clustered in jets from neutral particles in pileup interactions, using the FASTJET software package [32]. Jet energy corrections are derived from the simulation, and are validated with in-situ measurements using the energy balance of dijet, photon+jet, and Z+jets events [36]. Additional quality criteria are applied to the jets in order to remove spurious jet-like features originating from isolated noise patterns from the calorimeters or JHEP03(2016)125 the tracker. These jet quality requirements are found to be 99% efficient for signal events. The jets are required to have p T > 200 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.4.

When such a highly boosted Z decays to two quarks, their separation is often so small that they are reconstructed as a single jet with a mass larger than that of a typical Quantum ChromoDynamics (QCD) jet. To achieve the best possible mass resolution for this single jet, a jet pruning algorithm [37,38] is applied, which is also used by the CMS collaboration for several other physics analyses with hadronic decays of boosted W and Z bosons [33,[39][40][41][42]. This pruning procedure involves reclustering the constituents of the original jet and applying additional requirements to eliminate soft QCD radiation and large-angle QCD radiation coming from sources other than the Z boson. The kinematic distributions of the resultant jet are a closer reflection of the hard process. In particular, the pruned jet mass is closer to the mass of the parent Z boson.",

The \u03c4 N variable measures the capability of clustering the reconstructed particles in the jet in exactly N-subjets: if it has a small value then it represents a configuration that is more compatible with the N-subjettiness hypothesis. In particular, the variable that is best able to discriminate between the jets from a boosted Z boson decay and standard QCD jets is the ratio of 2-to 1-subjettiness, \u03c4 21 = \u03c4 2 /\u03c4 1 . If the jet has \u03c4 21 < 0.5 and if its pruned mass falls in the range between 70-110 GeV, the jet is tagged as originating from a Z boson, and is referred to as a \"fat jet\" in this paper. The mismodeling of the \u03c4 21 variable can bias the signal efficiency estimated from the simulated samples. A discrepancy between data and simulation has been observed in the identification efficiency measured in events containing merged jets produced by boosted W-bosons from top decays that pass the same V-tag selections as the ones in this jj analysis [33].

The photon misidentification rate is calculated in photon E T bins. It decreases with increasing photon E T and is at most of the order of a few percent.
