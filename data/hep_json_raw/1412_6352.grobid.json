The experiment is designed for precision measurements of CP violation and rare decays of beauty and charm hadrons. In this paper the performance of the various LHCb sub-detectors and the trigger system are described, using data taken from 2010 to 2012. It is shown that the design criteria of the experiment have been met. The excellent performance of the detector has allowed the LHCb collaboration to publish a wide range of physics results, demonstrating LHCb's unique role, both as a heavy flavour experiment and as a general purpose detector in the forward region.",

Its main goal is to search for indirect evidence of new physics in CP violation and rare decays of beauty and charm hadrons, by looking for the effects of new particles in processes that are precisely predicted in the Standard Model (SM) and by utilising the distinctive flavour structure of the SM with no tree-level flavour-changing neutral currents. Quark mixing in the SM is described by the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix, 1,2 which has a single source of CP violation. Since the level of CP violation in weak interactions cannot explain the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe, 3 new sources of CP violation beyond the SM are needed. The effect of such new sources might be seen in heavy flavour physics, where many models of new physics produce contributions that change the expectation values of the CP violating phases or the branching fractions of rare decays. Some models even predict decay modes that are forbidden in the SM. To examine such possibilities, CP violation and rare decays of hadrons containing b and c quarks must be studied with large data samples, using many different decay modes.",

Despite these large yields, at the LHC centre-of-mass energies of \u221a s = 7-8 TeV the charm and beauty cross-sections are approximately a factor 10 and 200 smaller than the total cross-section, respectively. To separate the decays of interest from the background, both displaced vertex and high transverse momentum signatures are exploited. Excellent vertex resolution is required to measure impact parameters and to achieve a good decay time resolution, which is essential to resolve B 0 s flavour oscillations and to reject various sources of background. Good momentum and invariant mass resolution are important to minimise combinatorial background and resolve heavy-flavour decays with kinematically similar topologies. Charged particle identification is essential in any flavour physics programme, for instance to isolate suppressed decays and for b-quark flavour tagging. Detection of photons, in addition to charged particles, allows the reconstruction of rare radiative decays and more common decays with a \u03c0 0 or an \u03b7 meson in the final state. Finally, to benefit from the high event rate at the LHC, a high-bandwidth data acquisition system and a robust and selective trigger system are required.",

Less attractive characteristics of the LHC environment are the generally increased background levels encountered, inherent to hadronic collisions, which result in a number of experimental compromises, such as reduced b flavour tagging efficiency and the difficulty in reconstructing final states with missing or neutral particles. Despite these challenges, the results 6 obtained from data taken between 2010 and 2013 (LHC Run I) have clearly established LHCb as the next generation flavour physics experiment. Thanks to efficient charged particle tracking and dedicated triggers for lepton, hadron and photon signatures, LHCb has the world's largest sample of exclusively reconstructed charm and beauty decays. With these samples, LHCb has already made many key results, such as the first evidence for the rare decay B 0 s \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 (Refs. 7 and 8) and measurements of angular distributions in the B 0 \u2192 K * 0 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 decay, 9,10 which are particularly sensitive to deviations from the SM. Another example is the measurement of the CP violating phase (\u03c6 s ) in the interference between mixing and decay of B 0 s mesons, where the value predicted within the SM is small, but much larger values are possible in new physics models. LHCb has measured this phase with results that are at present consistent with the SM within the uncertainties. 11,12 The measurement of the angle \u03b3 of the Unitarity ",

            "text": "The calorimeter system is composed of a Scintillating Pad Detector (SPD), a Preshower (PS), a shashlik type electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) and a hadronic calorimeter (HCAL). It provides the identification of electrons, photons and hadrons as well as the measurement of their energies and positions, and selects candidates with high transverse energy for the first trigger level (L0). The SPD improves the separation of electrons and photons. A 15 mm lead converter with a thickness of 2.5 radiation lengths (X 0 ) is placed between the planes of rectangular scintillating pads of the SPD and the PS. The background from charged pions is reduced by a measurement of the longitudinal partitioning of the electromagnetic shower in the PS detector and the main section of ECAL. The ECAL is made of a sampling scintillator/lead structure with a total thickness of 25 X 0 . The calorimeter system has a variable lateral segmentation which takes into account the variation in hit density of two orders of magnitude over the calorimeter surface. A segmentation into three different sections has been chosen for the ECAL with a corresponding projective geometry for the SPD and PS detectors, meaning that all of their transverse dimensions scale with the distance from the interaction point. The outer dimensions match projectively those of the tracking system, while the square hole around the beam-pipe approximately limits the inner acceptance to projective polar angles \u03b8 x,y > 25 mrad. The hadron calorimeter (HCAL) is a sampling device made from iron and scintillating tiles, as absorber and active material, respectively. The special feature of this sampling structure is the orientation of the scintillating tiles which run parallel to the beam-axis. Given the dimensions of the hadronic showers, the HCAL is segmented into two zones with different lateral dimensions. The thickness of the HCAL is limited to 5.6 nuclear interaction lengths (\u03bb i ) due to space constraints. The muon detection system provides muon identification and contributes to the L0 trigger of the experiment. It is composed of five stations (M1-M5) of rectangular shape equipped predominantly with Multi Wire Proportional Chambers (MWPC), except in the highest rate region of M1, where triple Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) detectors are used. The full system comprises 1380 chambers and covers a total area of 435 m 2 . Stations M2 to M5 are placed downstream of the calorimeters and are interleaved with 80 cm thick iron absorbers to select penetrating muons. The minimum momentum that a muon must have to traverse the five stations is approximately 6 GeV/c. The total absorber thickness, including the calorimeters, is approximately 20\u03bb i . Station M1 is placed in front of the calorimeters and is used to improve the p T measurement in the trigger. The geometry of the five stations is projective, with each station divided into four regions, R1 to R4, with increasing distance from the beam axis. The linear dimensions of the regions R1, R2, R3, R4, and their segmentation scale in the ratio 1:2:4:8. With this geometry, the channel occupancies are comparable in each of the four regions of a given station.",

It was demonstrated that the trigger and reconstruction work efficiently under such harsh conditions with increased detector occupancy due to pile-up, and that the physics output was not compromised.  The LHC beam energy was 3.5 TeV during 2010 and 2011. In the first part of the 2011 data taking the number of bunches in the machine increased in several steps to about 1300, the maximum possible with 50 ns bunch spacing. Due to the larger number of bunches the pile-up over the year could be reduced, while LHCb took the majority of the data at a luminosity of 3.5 \u00d7 10 32 cm \u22122 s \u22121 . This was 1.75 times more than the design luminosity of 2 \u00d7 10 32 cm \u22122 s \u22121 , as shown in Fig. 2. In 2011 a luminosity levelling procedure was introduced at the LHCb interaction point. By adjusting the transverse overlap of the beams at LHCb, the instantaneous luminosity could be kept stable to within about 5% during a fill, as illustrated in Fig. 3. For this particularly long fill, a maximum overlap with head-on beams was reached only after 15 hours. The luminosity levelling procedure minimises the effects of luminosity decay, allowing to maintain the same trigger configuration during a fill and to reduce systematic uncertainties due to changes in the detector occupancy.",

The charge sharing varies with the operational bias voltage and the projected angle of the track. The bias voltage was 150 V throughout the physics data taking in 2010 to 2013. The projected angle 30 provides information on the number of strips that the particle crosses while it traverses the thickness of the silicon sensor. Initially the resolution improves with increasing angle due to the charge sharing between strips, allowing more accurate interpolation of the hit position. The optimal resolution is obtained when the tracks cross the width of one strip when traversing the 300 \u03bcm thickness of the sensor. For the VELO the optimal projected angle varies between about 7 \u2022 at the lowest inter-strip pitch of 40 \u03bcm to about 18 \u2022 for the largest 100 \u03bcm pitch strips, as shown in Above the optimal angle the resolution begins to deteriorate due to the fluctuations in the charge on the strips and because the signal to noise ratio on individual strips may drop below the clustering threshold. The VELO reads out analogue pulse-height information from the strips, and this information is used offline to calculate the cluster position 30 using the weighted average of the strip ADC values. The resolution of the sensors is determined from the residual between the extrapolated position of the fitted track and the measured cluster position.

At the operational sensor temperature of approximately \u22127 \u2022 C, the average rate of sensor current increase is 18 \u03bcA per fb \u22121 , in agreement with predictions. 31 Dedicated data are taken around three times a year to study the charge collection of the VELO as a function of the bias voltage of the sensors. The bias voltage required to extract a fixed fraction of the maximum charge can then be determined. From this measurement the 'effective depletion voltage' can be determined, 31 and this is shown as a function of fluence in Fig. 6. Each sensor contributes multiple points to this plot in each data sample as the sensors are divided in the analysis into radial regions that have received similar fluences, as denoted by the different colours in the figure. The n-bulk sensors undergo space-charge sign inversion under irradiation, and hence their depletion voltage initially reduces with irradiation. This continues until type inversion occurs, after which it increases with further irradiation.

The 122,112 physical channels were aligned in time with an accuracy of 1 ns using samples of cosmic rays 36 and tracks from the first pp collisions in the detector. 35 The timing performance is measured from special calibration runs where events triggered by the calorimeters were acquired in a 125 ns wide gate around the triggered collision. A high-purity sample of muon candidates is obtained by reconstructing track segments from aligned muon detector hits in all of the five stations, and matching such segments with high-quality tracks reconstructed by the tracking detectors. The time resolution of muon detector hits associated to these tracks is measured to be between 2.5 and 4 ns, depending on the detector region. 35 The inefficiency  due to tails in the time measurement is estimated by counting the fraction of muon tracks having one or more hits outside the 25 ns time gate. In each of the time alignment runs acquired during the data taking, such inefficiency is found to never exceed 1.2%. The total hit efficiency of the muon chambers is measured using muon candidates in events triggered independently of the muon detector during the normal data taking. The efficiency for each station is estimated by searching hits around the position predicted by the segment reconstructed using only the other four stations, which must have a good matching with a high-quality track. For station M1, which is located upstream of the calorimeter system, candidate muons are also required to originate from a J/\u03c8 decay. Tracks close to the known dead channels are removed from the sample. The contribution of background hits accidentally matching the candidate track is subtracted using a statistical model.",

In order to reduce the number of off-detector readout channels, these signals are formed from the logical OR of several contiguous physical channels. The occupancy of these logical channels is thus larger than the occupancy of physical channels, and can lead to measurable dead-time effects, even in the outer detector regions. This happens in particular for station M5, which is affected by spurious hits due to back-scattering from the beam-line elements located behind the detector. Since the detector was operated at twice the nominal luminosity of 2 \u00d7 10 32 cm \u22122 s \u22121 , the dead-time effect is larger than originally expected. Nonetheless, most regions meet the 99% efficiency requirement.

Then, there are two complementary algorithms to add information from the downstream tracking stations to these VELO tracks. In the first algorithm, the forward tracking, the VELO tracks are combined with information from the T stations. The momentum of a particle and its trajectory through the detector are fully determined from the information provided by the VELO and a single T station hit. Further hits in the T stations are then searched along this trajectory to find the best possible combination of hits defining the long track. In the second algorithm, called track matching, 40,41 the VELO tracks are combined with track segments found after the magnet in the T stations, using a standalone track finding algorithm. 42 In order to form such a track segment, particles traversing the T stations need to provide at least one hit in the x layers and one in the stereo layers in each of the three stations. The candidate tracks found by each algorithm are then combined, removing duplicates, to form the final set of long tracks used for analysis. Finally, hits in the TT consistent with the extrapolated trajectories of each track are added to improve their momentum determination. Downstream tracks are found starting with T tracks, extrapolating them through the magnetic field and searching for corresponding hits in the TT. 43,44 Upstream tracks are found by extrapolating VELO tracks to the TT where matching hits are then added in a procedure similar to that used by the downstream tracking. At least three TT hits are required to be present by these algorithms.  In a final step, the tracks are fitted using a Kalman filter. 46,47 The fit takes into account multiple scattering and corrects for energy loss due to ionisation. The \u03c7 2 per degree of freedom of the fit is used to determined the quality of the reconstructed track. After the fit, the reconstructed track is represented by state vectors (x, y, dx/dz, dy/dz, q/p) which are specified at given z-positions in the experiment. If two or more tracks have many hits in common, only the one with most hits is kept. Figure 15 shows the tracks reconstructed in a typical event.",

The mass resolution is compared for six different dimuon resonances: the J/\u03c8 , \u03c8(2S), \u03a5 (1S), \u03a5 (2S) and \u03a5 (3S) mesons, and the Z 0 boson. These resonances are chosen as they share the same topology and exhibit a clean mass peak. A loose selection is applied to obtain the invariant mass distributions, as shown in Fig. 18.",

Ultimately this is what limits, for example, certain measurements such as the B 0 s oscillation frequency. Several methods have been deployed for track-based alignment in LHCb. One technique used for the VELO divides the alignment in three stages, corresponding to different detector granularity. 56,57 The relative alignment of each \u03a6 sensor with respect to the R sensor in the same module is performed by fitting an analytical form to the residuals as a function of \u03c6. The relative alignment of the modules within each VELO half are obtained with a \u03c7 2 minimisation based on an implementation of Millepede method. 58 The relative alignment of one VELO half with respect to the other half is also based on the Millepede method. It is performed using a track sample crossing the overlap region between the two halves and with a \u03c7 2 minimisation that exploits the difference in the position between primary vertices reconstructed in both halves.

An x scaling corresponds to a displacement along x of detector modules assembled in a single layer proportional to the x coordinate. In the TT and IT detectors such a scaling is constrained by tracks that traverse neighbouring ladders in the same layer. To profit from this constraint the sample of tracks is enriched by preferentially selecting such 'overlap' tracks. In principle, the z scaling of the spectrometer is fixed by the z scale of the vertex detector, which comes from a survey. In practice, this leads to a relatively poor constraint on the tracking layers downstream of the magnet. It has been verified that the last OT detector plane downstream of the magnet can be fixed to its survey position without introducing a momentum bias.",

Consequently, the detector is realigned after every technical stop and every magnetic field reversal.

The temperature change causes the support structure on which the modules are mounted to contract by an amount that is large enough to affect the curvature measurement, as shown by the bias in the J/\u03c8 mass. After a separate track-based alignment is performed for each period with constant temperature, the bias in the mass disappears. 65 This illustrates the importance of operating the detector under stable conditions.

If the decay time is sufficiently small, the daughter particles are reconstructed as long tracks, and for these decays the invariant mass resolution is as good as for short-lived resonances (see Subsec. 2.2.2 and Fig. 27). For V 0 's that decay outside the VELO acceptance, but before the magnet, the daughter particles are reconstructed as downstream tracks from hits in the TT and T stations. As the resolution on the track direction reconstructed in the layers of the TT is not as good as in the VELO, the invariant mass resolution for the downstream category is worse than for the short-lived category, as shown in Fig. 27 ",

The MIP sample is composed of reconstructed tracks of particles with momentum greater than 2 GeV/c to ensure that they reach the PS. 74 As for the SPD, the calibration is established at the  beginning of each data-taking period, checked regularly and corrected as necessary during the run. The calibration of the ECAL requires two main steps: the first to set an initial calibration, and the second to refine the values through an iterative procedure. The first step was performed at the beginning of LHCb commissioning by using testbeam measurements to reproduce the design energy range. With these settings, a \u03c0 0 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 mass resolution at the level of 10% was achieved for the first collisions in 2009. In subsequent years, initial settings were obtained using the LED system, achieving a similar accuracy of 8-10%. In the second step, initial calibration parameters are refined by studying the energy deposited over many events and requiring continuity across cell boundaries. 75 The calibration constants are improved by performing fits to the invariant mass distribution of \u03c0 0 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 decays, 76 combining a photon hitting the cell to be calibrated with another reconstructed photon. The procedure is repeated until all coefficients are stable. Figure 28 shows the change in the fitted \u03c0 0 invariant mass distribution, before and after the calibration procedure. By applying the method to a sample of miscalibrated simulated events, the final precision of the cell-to-cell intercalibration is estimated to be approximately 2%. In order to apply the \u03c0 0 mass fit to every cell in the ECAL, several hundred thousand events are required.",

The main cause of this is a decrease of the PMT gains due to the degradation of the dynode system at high integrated anode current. The gain losses are compensated by increasing the voltage between the PMT dynodes. The time period over which the gradual gain reduction takes place is shorter than the interval between which absolute calibrations can be performed for the ECAL (using \u03c0 0 mass reconstruction) and the HCAL (using the 137 Cs sources). Therefore, the relative corrections required to maintain performance are estimated using dedicated procedures. For the ECAL, the E/pc ratio is used whilst the HCAL is monitored using the LED pulse system. The change in performance with time is illustrated in Fig. 29, which shows the ratio between the L0-hadron trigger rate, based on the HCAL hardware, and a combination of muon-based triggers. As a result of the ageing, a gradual reduction of the rate is observed, with intermittent increases, corresponding to the application of a new set of PMT gains. given cell is present in more than one cluster, its energy is redistributed between the clusters under consideration according to the total energies of the clusters. Although this process is iterative, it converges rapidly because the effective Moli\u00e8re radius (3.5 cm) of the ECAL is smaller than the size of the cells, which have lengths of side of 4.04 cm, 6.06 cm and 12.12 cm for the inner, middle and outer regions, respectively.

The performance of high-energy photon reconstruction is illustrated by the reconstructed B 0 \u2192 K * 0 \u03b3 mass distribution shown in Fig. 30. The mass resolution obtained for this radiative decay is dominated by the ECAL energy resolution and is found to be 93 MeV/c 2 . 78 A comparison of the data with simulated samples shows that this corresponds to an accuracy of the cell-to-cell intercalibration of around 2%. is obtained for such neutral pions. However, due to the finite ECAL granularity, photon pairs from the decay of sufficiently high momentum \u03c0 0 cannot be resolved as individual clusters. This essentially holds for all \u03c0 0 meson decays with transverse momentum above 2 GeV/c. To reconstruct such 'merged' \u03c0 0 candidates, a procedure has been designed to identify overlapping clusters. The algorithm consists of splitting each single ECAL cluster into two 3 \u00d7 3 subclusters built around the two highest energy deposits of the original cluster. The energy of the common cells is then distributed between the two assumed subclusters by fitting the energy distribution with that of two photons, using the expected transverse profile obtained from simulations. Since the position of the two subcluster barycentres is a function of the energy distribution, this procedure requires an iterative process. The performance of neutral pion reconstruction is illustrated in Fig. 31, which shows the invariant mass distribution for D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 0 candidates for resolved and merged \u03c0 0 candidates. 79 In this example, the estimated invariant mass resolution is 30 MeV/c for the merged \u03c0 0 candidates and 20 MeV/c for the resolved ones.",

Because the nonconverted photon estimator depends on the energy and the calorimeter zone, several probability density functions are constructed from simulations, for both signal and background, corresponding to each of the zones. The difference in log-likelihood between the photon and the background hypotheses (\u0394 log L) is calculated and used to identify photons.

This difference is evaluated by a neural network classifier (specifically, a multi-layer perceptron) trained with photons from a simulated B 0 \u2192 K * 0 \u03b3 sample as signal and \u03c0 0 mesons from a mixture of B decays as background. These \u03c0 0 mesons are reconstructed and selected as photons using the same B 0 \u2192 K * 0 \u03b3 preselection used for the signal sample. A photon identification efficiency of 95% can be obtained while rejecting 45% of the merged \u03c0 0 meson background that are reconstructed as photons. Figure 32 shows the photon identification efficiency with respect to the \u03c0 0 rejection efficiency for simulation and data. Photons converted before the magnet are reconstructed from electron-positron tracks. The electron (positron) is selected on the basis of its electron PID variables and electron confidence level, requiring a minimum p T value and an E/pc value within a selected range. The algorithm only combines electron-positron pairs for which the associated clusters have energy-weighted positions that are closer than 3\u03c3 of cluster extent (and 200 mm) in the vertical plane, at the average z barycentre of clusters. Pairs are selected on the basis of their transverse momenta, their dielectron masses and their reconstructed vertex positions. The electron energy is corrected by including any bremsstrahlung photons measured by the calorimeters that are compatible with the electron-positron pair. Figure 33 shows the ratio of photon detection efficiencies between converted and non-converted photons coming from the decay of \u03c0 0 mesons for both simulation and data. The simulation provides a good description of the photon reconstruction efficiency implying that the detector material where the conversions occur is modelled well, and that the reconstruction algorithms work equally well in data and simulation. The level of performance is illustrated by analyses that benefit from the good resolution obtained using converted photons, such as \u03c7 c \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03b3 (Ref.

For example, Fig. 34 shows the E/pc distribution in the ECAL for electrons and hadrons, produced using the first 340 pb \u22121 recorded in 2011. The electron distribution has been produced using reconstructed electrons from photon conversions and the hadron distribution using pions and kaons from D 0 meson decays.

The yields for the three radiators used in LHCb are measured in data using two different samples of events. 82 The first sample is representative of normal LHCb data taking conditions, and consists of the kaons and pions originating from the decay D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + , where the D 0 is selected from D * + \u2192 D 0 \u03c0 + decays. The second sample consists of low detector occupancy p p \u2192 p p \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 events, which provide a clean track sample with very low background levels. In both samples, only high-momentum tracks are selected, to ensure that the Cherenkov angle is close to saturation. Table 3 shows the results of the photoelectron yield extraction, performed on both real and simulated data. In data, the D * + \u2192 D 0 \u03c0 + events have values of N pe that are less than those for p p \u2192 p p \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 events. This is mainly due to the higher charged track multiplicities of the D * + \u2192 D 0 \u03c0 + events, reducing the effective N pe , and the track geometry cut that is applied to the p p \u2192 p p \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 events increasing their N pe yield. The aerogel N pe data values have a large uncertainty due to the significant background levels in the \u0394\u03b8 C distributions and the additional uncertainty in the shape of the signal peak. 82 The photoelectron yields for data are lower than those predicted by the simulation. One reason for this is a small detector read-out inefficiency, which was identified during high trigger rate data taking in Run I. The results presented include a retuning of the read-out settings, applied during data taking to minimise the impact of the inefficiency. A further optimisation will be performed for LHC Run II to reduce the effect to the negligible level, and is expected to improve the yields further by a few percent. The remaining discrepancy is accounted for by an over-estimate of the yield in the simulation, which will be addressed by improved simulation tunings. It must be stressed however, that the smaller yield measured in data does not have The LHCb Collaboration a significant impact on the final particle identification performance, as described in Subsec. 4.2.3.",

A search is performed for hits within rectangular windows around the extrapolation points where the x and y dimensions of the windows are parameterised as a function of momentum at each station and separately for each muon system region. The parameters are optimised to maximise the efficiency and at the same time provide low misidentification probabilities of pions as muons. The same criterion is used to define the number of stations required to have hits within a window as a function of momentum. A minimum momentum of 3 GeV/c is necessary for a muon to traverse the calorimeters and reach the M2 and M3 stations, while above 6 GeV/c they traverse all five of the stations. For each muon candidate, likelihoods for the muon and non-muon hypotheses are computed, based on the average squared distance of the hits that are closest to the extrapolation points. The performance of the muon identification is obtained from data using muons from J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 decays, protons from \u039b \u2192 p\u03c0 \u2212 decays and kaons and pions from D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + , where the D 0 is selected from D * + \u2192 D 0 \u03c0 + decays. These  samples can be selected without using PID information and are characterised by relatively high statistics and low background. The latter is subtracted by fitting the appropriate invariant mass distribution.

This muon can be produced close to the interaction point or in the calorimeter shower. Since the window dimension decreases with momentum and an increasing number of hits is required for tracks above 10 GeV/c, a strong reduction of the proton misidentification rate is seen in the interval 3-30 GeV/c and for p T < 1.7 GeV/c. For higher p T values, the protons have a high polar angle and therefore fall outside of the high-occupancy part of the detector. Decays in flight are the main cause of misidentification of pions and kaons as muons. To a good approximation, the misidentification rate is the sum of the contribution of decays in flight and the proton misidentification probability.",

L0Photon is the highest E T ECAL cluster with 1 or 2 PS hits in front of the ECAL cluster and no hit in the SPD cells corresponding to the PS cells. L0Electron has the same requirements as L0Photon, with the additional condition of at least one SPD cell hit in front of the PS cells. The E T of each candidate is compared to a fixed threshold and events containing at least one candidate above threshold fire the L0 trigger. The total number of hits in the SPD is also determined, and is used to veto events that would take a disproportionately large fraction of the available processing time in the HLT. The SPD hit multiplicity requirements are listed in Table 4. The L0 muon processors look for the two highest p T muon tracks in each quadrant. The position of a track in the first two stations allows the determination of its p T with a measured momentum resolution of roughly 25%. The trigger considers the eight candidates and sets a single threshold on either the largest transverse momentum, p T largest , or on the product, p T largest \u00d7 p T 2nd largest . These thresholds are listed in Table 4. The tightening of L0 thresholds in the 2012 configuration is a consequence of the increased luminosity and beam energy.",

However, the offline algorithm makes a second pass on unused hits to enhance the efficiency for tracks pointing far away from the beam-line, while in the HLT this second pass is not used due to CPU constraints. Vertices are reconstructed from a minimum of five intersecting VELO tracks. Vertices within a radius of 300 \u03bcm of the mean position of the pp-interaction envelope are considered to be primary vertices. HLT1 limits the number of VELO tracks that are passed through the forward tracking algorithm that searches for matching hits in the tracking stations. VELO tracks must have a significant IP with respect to all PVs, or be matched to muon chamber hits by a fast muon identification algorithm. This algorithm is only run in events that were triggered by a muon line in the hardware step. To further limit the processing time, the forward track search has a minimum momentum requirement that varied between 3 and 6 GeV/c during Run I. VELO tracks without matching muon hits are also subject to a minimum p T threshold that varied between 0.5 and 1.25 GeV/c. The reconstructed forward tracks are fitted using a Kalman filter with a simplified detector geometry description and fewer iterations than in the offline configuration. The invariant mass resolution of J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 candidates reconstructed with this procedure is found to be 3% worse than the 15.1 MeV/c 2 obtained offline.

However, the read-out and trigger scheme of the current LHCb detector limit the luminosity that can be recorded. To overcome these limitations, the LHCb experiment will be upgraded [94][95][96][97][98][99] to allow the detector to be read out at the maximum LHC bunch crossing rate of 40 MHz with a flexible software-based trigger. This will not only allow the data rate to be increased substantially, but will also increase the trigger efficiency, especially for channels currently triggered at the hardware level by energy deposits in the calorimeters. In addition to the significant increase in sensitivity for flavour physics, the experiment will continue to explore other interesting signatures and thus act as a general purpose detector in the forward region.",

To determine the trigger efficiency, trigger objects are associated with signal tracks. The criteria used to associate a trigger object with a signal track are as follows. An event is classified as Trigger on Signal (TOS) if the trigger objects that are associated with the signal candidate are sufficient to trigger the event. An event is classified as Trigger Independent of Signal (TIS) if it has been triggered by trigger objects that are not associated with the signal. Some events can be classified as TIS and TOS simultaneously (TIS & TOS), which allows the determination of the trigger efficiency relative to the offline reconstructed events from data alone. The efficiency to trigger an event independently of the signal, TIS , is given by",
