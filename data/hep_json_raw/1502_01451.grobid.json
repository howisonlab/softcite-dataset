            "text": "It is well known that the description of the partonic structure of the nucleon at leading twist requires the knowledge of three parton distribution functions (PDFs), the number, helicity and transversity PDFs. Being chirally odd, the transversity distribution is difficult to be measured and is still the least known of the three, but in the past ten years both the HERMES and the COMPASS experiments have provided unambiguous evidence that transversity is different from zero. 1 Experimentally, the transversity distribution has been probed in semi-inclusive deeply inelastic scattering (SIDIS) experiments on transversely polarized targets in two different ways. In the first one a target spin dependent azimuthal asymmetry in single-hadron production was measured, which depends on the convolution of transversity and a transverse-momentum dependent chirally odd fragmentation function, H \u22a5 1 , the so-called Collins function. 2 The second process is dihadron production, [3][4][5] where transversity couples to a dihadron fragmentation function H \u22a5 1 . In both cases essential information for the extraction of transversity was provided by the measurements of the azimuthal asymmetries of the hadrons produced in e + e \u2212 annihilation. 6,7 Recently COMPASS has provided experimental evidence of a close relationship between the Collins and the dihadron asymmetries, hinting at a common physical origin of the two fragmentation functions, 8, 9 a conclusion also supported by calculations with a specific Monte Carlo model. 10 That work has been continued and new results are here presented for the first time.",

The results presented in this paper have been extracted from the data collected with a transversely polarized proton (NH 3 ) target in 2010, already used to measure the Collins and the dihadron asymmetries. 9,12 In the x-Bjorken region where the Collins asymmetry is different from zero and sizable (x > 0.032) the positive and negative hadron asymmetries exhibit a mirror symmetry and the dihadron asymmetry is very close to the Collins asymmetry for positive hadrons. This suggests that the anti-correlation between the azimuthal angles of the positive and negative hadrons, which is present in the multi-hadrons fragmentation of the struck quark due to a local transverse momentum conservation, is also present in the Collins fragmentation function that describes the spin-dependent hadronization of a transversely polarized quark.",

Evaluating the ratio of the integrals of the two-hadron amplitudes over the one-hadron amplitudes one gets a value of 4/\u03c0 which is in agreement with our original observation that the dihadron asymmetry is somewhat larger than the Collins asymmetry for positive hadrons. As a conclusion, we have shown that in the SIDIS process the Collins asymmetries of the positive and negative hadrons are mirror symmetric, in agreement with a (1 \u2212 cos \u2206\u03c6) dependence which is expected from general principles. Most important, the amplitude of the dihadron asymmetry has a very simple relation to that of the single hadron asymmetries, confirming our original observation that the Collins mechanism and the interference fragmentation must have a common physical origin.",
