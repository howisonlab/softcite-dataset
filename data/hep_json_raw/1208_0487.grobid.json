            "text": "The COMPASS experiment at the CERN SPS investigates the structure and spectrum of hadrons by scattering high energetic hadrons and polarised muons off various fixed targets. During the years 2002-2007, COMPASS focused on nucleon spin physics using 160 GeV/c polarised \u00b5 + beams on polarised deuteron and proton targets, including measurements of the gluon contribution to the nucleon spin using longitudinal target polarisation as well as studies of transverse spin effects in the nucleon on a transversely polarised target. One major goal of the physics programme using hadron beams is the search for new states, in particular the search for J PC exotic states and glue-balls. COMPASS measures not only charged but also neutral final-state particles, allowing for investigation of new objects in different reactions and decay channels. In addition COMPASS can measure low-energy QCD constants like, e.g. the electromagnetic polarisability of the pion. Apart from a few days pilot run data taken in 2004 with a 190 GeV/c \u03c0 \u2212 beam on a Pb target, showing a significant spin-exotic J PC = 1 \u2212+ resonance at around 1660 MeV/c 2 , COM-PASS collected high statistics with negative and positive 190 GeV/c hadron beams on a proton (H 2 ) and nuclear (Ni, Pb) targets in 2008 and 2009. We give a selected overview of the newest results and discuss the status of various ongoing analyses.",

Such states are beyond the simple Constituent Quark Model (CQM), however, they are allowed and even predicted within Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). Their existence has been speculated about almost since the introduction of colour [2,3] and the experimental proof would be a fundamental confirmation of QCD. Even though several candidates have been reported in the past by various experiments, especially their resonance nature is still highly disputed in the community, a recent overview is given by [4].",

With the high statistics data COMPASS collected in 2008 using a 190 GeV/c negative pion beam scattered off a liquid hydrogen (proton) target, we have access to all relevant decay channels in which hybrid candidates were reported in the past, see e.g. [6]. Especially the fact that COMPASS measures not only charged final state particles but also neutral particles, like \u03c0 0 , \u03b7, and \u03b7 , is of great advantage, allowing for independent confirmation of new states within the same experiment.",

A significant dependence on the target material for the production strengths of partial-waves with spin projection M=0 versus M=1 has been found comparing the (3\u03c0) \u2212 PWA results for the 2004 Pb (charged) and the 2008 (charged and neutral) proton target data. The production strength of M=1 waves is observed to be suppressed on a proton as compared to the heavier nuclear Pb target and vice versa for M=0 waves, whereas the corresponding spin totals (fitted intensities summed up for both spin projections M), do not show any significant difference. These observations are re-confirmed in the 2009 Pb target data (charged mode) [10,11], again in comparison to the 2008 proton target data results (to compensate for the different statistics collected and analysed, all those comparisons were consistently done after normalisation to the well-known and narrow a 2 (1320) resonance).",

Going to the 5\u03c0 system is the natural step. As charge conversion reactions at COMPASS energies (190 GeV/c beam momentum) are strongly suppressed, a final state produced in diffractive pion dissociation is also negatively charged. Any 4\u03c0 final state therefore contains at least one \u03c0 0 . For the 2004 data limited in statistics (especially for final states involving neutral particles like \u03c0 0 due to the significantly lower detection efficiencies), the next simple fully charged final state populated contains five charged pions. Even though we do not expect to find spin-exotic 5\u03c0 resonances in the low momentum transfer range of 0 < t < 0.005 analysed from the 2004 data [12] discussed here, the PWA results on diffractive dissociation into 5\u03c0 final states allow for precise study of various resonances not only in the light meson sector, but also exceeding 2 GeV/c 2 . The present status of determined mass and width parameters are shown in Fig. 2. These results are also under preparation to be published soon.",

They show significant contributions that can be attributed to the a 2 (1320) (D+ wave) and the a 4 (2040) (G+ wave) resonances. The spin-exotic P+ wave, however, appears differently: The contribution in \u03b7 \u03c0 \u2212 is much enhanced as compared to \u03b7\u03c0 \u2212 , inline with the observations by the VES collaboration [13]. In particular the extracted phase motion (still to be taken with caution, as more systematic studies are ongoing) is found similar but stronger for \u03b7\u03c0 \u2212 (Fig. 3, bottom/centre). The relative strengths of the a 2 (1320) and of the a 4 (2040) are consistent with theoretical predictions (\u03b7\u2212\u03b7 mixing). For a more detailed discussion, see [14]. To summarise, COMPASS basically reproduces the results on \u03b7\u03c0 \u2212 and \u03b7 \u03c0 \u2212 as found by previous experiments.",

A first event selection of the centrally produced (\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) system, on which a first model to describe the data in terms of partial-waves is being developed. First fits to the 2009 pp data based on this ansatz deliver promising PWA results of the two-pseudoscalar final state consistent with those found by a previous experiment, namely the Omega Spectrometer at CERN (WA91) [18]. For the first results and details on the very preliminary analysis, we refer the interested reader to a recent conference contribution [19]. The natural next step here will be the analysis of the K + K \u2212 system, worth mentioning are also further channels available in the COMPASS 2009 pp data such as K s K s , \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 and \u03b7\u03b7 -COMPASS aims to shed new light also to this physics sector, improving the results by previous experiments in terms of statistics and resolution.

Inline with the priorities, the focus has been given to the hadron spectroscopy programme in terms of PWA results in the context of the search for spin-exotic mesons. Especially the status of the search for the \u03c0 1 (1600) in the 2008 COMPASS hadron beam data has been discussed, confirming the (3\u03c0) \u2212 PWA results published from the 2004 data (3 charged pion final states) in two different decay modes (charged and neutral) on the 2008 proton target data, and extending the search to further decay channels, such as \u03b7\u03c0, \u03b7 \u03c0 and f 1 \u03c0. Even though not relevant for the search for spin-exotic mesons, the first COMPASS PWA results on kaon diffraction should be mentioned [24], and also further physics measurements of interest are carried out at COMPASS, like e.g. the measurement of OZI violation in \u03c9 versus \u03a6 production, showing a OZI violation of about a factor of 3 to 4 (depending on x F ), these results are reported in a dedicated contribution at this conference [25].",
