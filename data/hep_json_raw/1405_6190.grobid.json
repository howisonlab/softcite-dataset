The observed rate is 582 \u00b1 94 (kton-days) \u22121 , which corresponds to a 862 keV 7 Be solar neutrino flux of (3.26 \u00b1 0.52) \u00d7 10 9 cm \u22122 s \u22121 , assuming a pure electron-flavor flux. Comparing this flux with the standard solar model prediction and further assuming three-flavor mixing, a \u03bde survival probability of 0.66 \u00b1 0.15 is determined from the KamLAND data. Utilizing a global three-flavor oscillation analysis, we obtain a total 7 Be solar neutrino flux of (5.82 \u00b1 1.02) \u00d7 10 9 cm \u22122 s \u22121 , which is consistent with the standard solar model predictions.",

The observation of anti-neutrino flavor oscillations by the KamLAND experiment [11], having mixing parameters consistent with those needed to explain the solar data, showed neutrino mixing to be responsible for what had been known as the Solar Neutrino Problem.",

The necessity of a large detector is evident considering the small ES cross section, which gives, for the KamLAND scintillator, an expected interaction rate of 500 (kton-days) \u22121 including neutrino flavor conversion. The ES induced recoil electrons have to be measured without the benefit of a convenient event tag. Here lies the main difficulty of these experiments: the low-energy backgrounds of a kiloton-size detector have to be sufficiently suppressed to allow the observation of a signal composed of only few events, a non-trivial task. In the current work this is achieved by comparing detector background models with and without a solar recoil signal to the data. The presence of such a signal is then inferred from the data by means of a chi-square statistical analysis.",

Based on extensive small-scale laboratory studies, large scintillator distillation and nitrogen purge systems were constructed underground. Two purification campaigns were performed in 2007 and 2008-2009. During the purification campaigns the old LS was drained from the detector and simultaneously filled with recycled, purified LS such that the LS mass supported by the balloon remained constant. To maximize the efficiency of purification, the temperature and density of the purified LS was carefully controlled in order to maintain a boundary between the old and purified LS. By the end of both campaigns more than five detector volume exchanges were performed, resulting in a substantial reduction of the background-creating impurities. The overall reduction factors for rates of 85 Kr, 210 Bi, and 210 Po, were about 6 \u00d7 10 \u22126 , 8 \u00d7 10 \u22124 , and 5 \u00d7 10 \u22122 , respectively. This dramatic reduction allowed the primary trigger threshold to be lowered from 180 PMT hits to 70 PMT hits (the latter value corresponds to a threshold of \u223c0.4 MeV), and thus extended KamLAND's sci-  The event position and energy are reconstructed based on the time and charge of photon-hits recorded by the PMTs. The KamLAND coordinate system utilizes the horizontal equatorial plane as its xy-plane; the z-axis points up. The reconstruction is calibrated using gamma sources deployed periodically in the detector -namely 7 Be (0.478 MeV), 60 Co (2.506 MeV), 68 Ge (1.022 MeV), 85 Sr (0.514 MeV), 137 Cs (0.661 MeV), and 203 Hg (0.279 MeV). The effects of scintillation quenching, Cherenkov light production, and PMT dark hits on the energy scale non-linearity are determined from this calibration data. They are corrected for in the spectral analysis discussed later. The observed vertex resolution is \u223c13 cm/ E(MeV), and the energy resolution (\u03c3 E /E) is (6.9 \u00b1 0.1)%/ E(MeV). The deviation of the position dependent energy from the center of the detector is evaluated as +0.3% to \u22121.5% inside of the \u22124.5 < z < 4.5 m region shown in Figure 2. The majority of the calibrations were performed by moving the sources to specific points along the central vertical detector axis using the deployment system described in Ref. [17]. In order to constrain deviations from rotational symmetry after scintillator purification, a full 3Dcalibration was performed using an off-axis system described in Ref. [18].",

This is attributed to 210 Bi supplied from the balloon surface by irregular LS convection currents, followed by its decay with T 1/2 = 5.01 days. This interpretation is supported by the observation that around the balloon surface, the spectrum is dominated by electrons from 210 Bi decays, and \u03b1-particles from 210 Po decays, consistent with the hypothesis that the balloon film is contaminated with \u223c200 Bq of 210 Pb, a 222 Rn daughter introduced during detector construction.

Due to the fluid circulation during LS purification, 238 U, 232 Th, and 40 K may have non-uniform spatial distributions. The long-lived radioactive noble gas, 85 Kr, was the major source of low-energy background prior to scintillator purification. The present background model includes this component to deal with any leftover activity. 39 Ar is included as a potential source in the background model, its abundance constrained by the ratio of 85 Kr and 39 Ar found in the atmosphere. From the spectral fit we find its contribution to the background is negligible. This is consistent with the pre-purification spectral analysis results. For volume ranks 1 through 6 the 85 Kr specific activity varies between 4.1 \u00b5Bq/m 3 and 19.2 \u00b5Bq/m 3 . For the highest background partitions -those with rank 7 -the fit only yields an upper limit for the activity. After LS purification, we collected samples from a location within the fiducial volume at z = +1.5 m. These samples were analyzed for their Kr con-tent using a helium purge, a cold trap to retain the Kr, and a residual gas analyzer to measure its partial pressure. Based on these measurements, the 85 Kr decay rate was estimated at 8.3 \u00b1 4.2 \u00b5Bq/m 3 , assuming a recent isotopic ratio of 85 Kr in air [19]. As a third cross check for the 85 Kr content of the LS, a 85 Kr-85m Rb delayed coincidence analysis was performed, utilizing the beta decay into the metastable, 514 keV excited state of 85 Rb. This analysis yielded 17.3 \u00b1 5.9 \u00b5Bq/m 3 , averaged over the entire FV. 85 Kr undergoes a unique first forbidden beta decay. The beta spectrum contained in the background model was calculated using a relativistic Fermi function plus a shape correction accounting for the forbiddenness following the procedure outlined in Ref.

Data collected with the full volume calibration system showed vertex reconstruction deviations of less than 5 cm. This corresponds to a FV uncertainty of 3.4%. The FV event selection inefficiency due to vertex misreconstruction was established with source calibrations and is less than 0.5% in the analysis energy region, confirmed by the source calibrations.",

The correction for the non-linearity of the energy scale for each particle type (\u03b3, e \u2212 and e + ) is performed by varying the energy response parameters in the \u03c7 2 -fit. The fit model, on which the solar neutrino analysis is based, uses free-floating energy scales with constraints from calibration data in the form of penalty terms. As such, the fit uncertainty already includes the energy scale uncertainty. In order to quantify the contribution of the energy scale uncertainty as a separate item in the error budget, we repeat the fit with the energy scale parameters fixed. The energy scale error is stated as the quadratic difference between the errors obtained from free-floating and fixed parameter fits. This method implies a 7.9% uncertainty on the best-fit 7 Be rate due to the uncertainty of the energy scale. To check the possibility of the energy scale varying with the rank we compared the fit result for two extreme cases, namely fully correlated and fully independent energy scale between ranks. We adopt the deviation of the best-fit 7 Be as an estimate of the associated systematic uncertainty. To propagate the 0.1%/ E(MeV) uncertainty of the energy resolution we repeat the analysis varying the detector resolution within this uncertainty. We find that this causes the best-fit 7 Be rate to vary by 3.4%. The definition of rank boundaries (Table I) and their effect on the best-fit 7 Be rate was also studied. It is important to note that the fit sensitivity to the solar signal comes from ranks 1 and 2 where the signal-to-background is largest, hence changing the boundary definitions of the other ranks has negligible effect. The fitting procedure was repeated while varying the boundary between ranks 1 and 2 from 3 \u00d7 10 \u22126 to 7 \u00d7 10 \u22126 events/(m 3 s). The choice of 5 \u00d7 10 \u22126 events/(m 3 s) as the boundary was found to have the highest fit probability, quantified by \u03c7 2 /n.d.f, and is used in the final analysis presented here. Furthermore, we find the best-fit rate for all rank boundaries considered were consistent with each other to within 5% and conclude that the choice of boundary does not bias the result.",

            "text": "The systematic uncertainties due to the 238 U and 232 Th series and other solar neutrinos are evaluated by the deviation of the 7 Be solar neutrino rate on varying their rates within \u00b11\u03c3. The 7 Be solar neutrino rate is estimated by a likelihood fit to the binned energy spectra of candidate events with visible energy between 0.5 and 1.4 MeV. The background contributions from 210 Bi, 85 Kr, 40 K, and 7 Be EC are free parameters and their normalizations are left unconstrained in the fit. The contributions from the 222 Rn-210 Pb and 228 Th-208 Pb chains, and 11 C are allowed to vary but their normalizations are constrained by independent KamLAND measurements, as outlined in Section V. Distributions with different background rank are fitted simultaneously. The background rates, derived from the fit normalizations, are summarized in Table III. The backgrounds from external gamma-rays, and pile-up events are constrained by the MC study. The model parameters of the detector response are also constrained, as discussed in Section VI. Figure 5 shows the result of this procedure: the best-fit spectrum for the rank-1 data-set which is lowest in background, and therefore, most sensitive to the solar neutrino signal. The inset shows the background subtracted energy distribution, which exhibits the shape of the best-fit 7 Be neutrino signal extracted from the analysis. The backscattering edge is visible and located at the correct energy. The \u03c7 2 /d.o.f. comparing the binned data and the best-fit model is found to be 635.3/589 using data of all ranks. The \u03c7 2 /d.o.f. of the lowest background rank-1 data is 80.1/90. As can be seen from the data in Table III the solar-signal to background ratio is estimated to be 1:5.5 for rank 1 data (0.5 < E < 0.8 MeV). This relatively low signal to background ratio naturally invites the question whether a statistically significant 7 Be solar neutrino signal is really present in the data. The fit to the data was also performed assuming the absence of a solar neutrino signal, but minimizing all other background components within their constraints as before. The observed increase in the fit \u03c7 2 leads us to reject the no-solar signal hypothesis at 8.2\u03c3 CL. To understand whether the solar recoil signal, preferred by the data and shown in the inset of Figure 5, is a unique solution or whether other continuous distributions yield equally good fits, the neutrino energy (assuming a mono-energetic source) and interaction rates were floated and the fit \u03c7 2 -profile determined under their variation. The result of this procedure is shown in Figure 6. The KamLAND data clearly prefer the presence of an edge at an energy that coincides with that expected for solar 7 Be neutrino induced electron recoils. Assuming that the edge is indeed solar neutrino induced, we determine the solar neutrino energy to be E \u03bd = 862 \u00b1 16 keV. This is the first direct spectroscopic determination of the solar 7 Be neutrino energy.",

This result is in agreement with the latest interaction rate reported by the Borexino experiment: [12]. The rate difference (R KL \u2212 R B ) deviates by 1.3\u03c3 from zero. Differences in the chemical composition of the liquid scintillators used in both experiments result in a 3.6% difference of the rates.

Performing this difficult measurement required an extensive purification campaign, reducing the scintillator's radio-impurity content by several orders of magnitude The measured 7 Be solar neutrino rate in KamLAND is R KL = 582 \u00b1 94 (kton-days) \u22121 , which corresponds to a flux of (5.82 \u00b1 1.02) \u00d7 10 9 cm \u22122 s \u22121 under the assumption of KamLAND's 2013 best-fit oscillation parameters. The statistical significance of this signal is estimated to be 8.2\u03c3 and provides the first independent verification of the only prior measurement of this quantity, performed by Borexino. The solar neutrino flux derived from the KamLAND data agrees with the solar model values, but is not accurate enough to shed light on the question of solar metallicity.",
