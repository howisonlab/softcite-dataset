            "text": "A search for resonances and quantum black holes is performed using the dijet mass spectra measured in proton-proton collisions at ffiffi ffi s p \u00bc 8 TeV with the CMS detector at the LHC. The data set corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb \u22121 . In a search for narrow resonances that couple to quark-quark, quarkgluon, or gluon-gluon pairs, model-independent upper limits, at 95% confidence level, are obtained on the production cross section of resonances, with masses above 1.2 TeV. When interpreted in the context of specific models the limits exclude string resonances with masses below 5.0 TeV; excited quarks below 3.5 TeV; scalar diquarks below 4.7 TeV; W 0 bosons below 1.9 TeV or between 2.0 and 2.2 TeV; Z 0 bosons below 1.7 TeV; and Randall-Sundrum gravitons below 1.6 TeV. A separate search is conducted for narrow resonances that decay to final states including b quarks. The first exclusion limit is set for excited b quarks, with a lower mass limit between 1.2 and 1.6 TeV depending on their decay properties. Searches are also carried out for wide resonances, assuming for the first time width-to-mass ratios up to 30%, and for quantum black holes with a range of model parameters. The wide resonance search excludes axigluons and colorons with mass below 3.6 TeV, and color-octet scalars with mass below 2.5 TeV. Lower bounds between 5.0 and 6.3 TeV are set on the masses of quantum black holes.",

The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb \u22121 collected with the CMS detector at the CERN LHC in 2012. This analysis extends the search for new phenomena presented in previous CMS [1][2][3][4][5][6] and ATLAS [7][8][9][10][11] publications. A review of experimental searches for new particles in the dijet mass spectrum is presented in Ref. [12]. Many extensions of the standard model (SM) predict the existence of new massive particles that couple to quarks or antiquarks (q) and gluons (g). These new particles could produce resonant bumps in the dijet invariant mass distribution associated with strong interaction processes. A similar signature could be produced by quantum black holes (QBH) that decay primarily to dijet final states.",

The dijet mass spectrum for QBHs is characterized by a peaking structure, as a result of the opening of the QBH production threshold for parton center-of-mass energies above the minimum mass M min QBH of QBHs and the steeply falling parton luminosity at higher center-of-mass energies. This shape differs from a resonance line shape and is almost independent of both the number of extra dimensions n and the scale M D .",

Within the field volume are located the silicon pixel and strip tracker and the barrel and endcap calorimeters; a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter. An iron/quartz-fiber calorimeter is located in the forward region, outside the field volume. For triggering purposes and to facilitate jet reconstruction, the calorimeter cells are grouped into towers projecting radially outward from the center of the detector. Events are filtered using a two-tier trigger system: a hardware-based first level (L1) and a software-based high-level trigger (HLT). The information from the individual detectors is combined in a global view of the event, the particle-flow (PF) event reconstruction [33,34], which attempts to identify all the particles detected in a collision and to measure their momenta. A more detailed description of the CMS detector, together with a definition of the coordinate system used and the relevant kinematic variables, can be found in Ref. [32].",

Resonances containing gluons, which are more susceptible to radiation than quarks, have a more pronounced tail. For high-mass resonances, there is also another significant contribution depending on both parton distributions and the natural width of the Breit-Wigner resonance shape: when the resonance is produced by interaction of nonvalence partons in the proton, the low-mass component of the Breit-Wigner resonance shape is amplified by a larger parton probability at low fractional momentum, producing a large tail at low-mass values.",

Figure 5 shows the expected limits and their uncertainty bands for qq, qg, and gg resonances compared to both observed limits and model predictions. For the RS graviton, which couples either to a pair of gluons or to a qq pair, the model-dependent cross section limits are obtained using a weighted average of the qq (where q \u00bc u, d, c, s, and b, excluding the top quark) and gg dijet mass shapes. The weight factors of about 0.5 correspond to the relative branching fractions for these two final states derived from Ref. [26]. Figure 6 shows a similar plot for an excited b quark. The observed upper limits are reported in Tables I and II for the inclusive and b-enriched analyses, respectively.

            "text": "In the previous sections we have described a search for narrow dijet resonances, where the intrinsic resonance width is negligible compared to the experimental dijet mass resolution. In order to quantify the impact of this search on models with wide resonances, we consider the case of a RS graviton produced via qq and gg annihilation and decaying, respectively, to qq and gg final states. Samples are generated with PYTHIA scanning the plane defined by the graviton mass M and the coupling parameter k=M Pl . For resonances with mass at the TeV scale, the width-to-mass ratio of the resonance is \u0393=M \u2248 1.4\u00f0k=M Pl \u00de 2 [26]. The excluded signal cross section is presented as a function of the resonance mass and width, separately for the qq and gg final states, in order to allow for the interpretation of the results in a generic model. The (M, k=M Pl ) scan is performed using events generated with PYTHIA 8.153 and a parametric, fast simulation of the CMS detector [57]. The predicted signal distribution is corrected for the difference in the JES between the fast simulation and the GEANT4-based CMS simulation. Figure 7 shows the corrected dijet mass distributions for several different values of resonance mass M and width-tomass ratio \u0393=M. a function of the resonance mass is shown in Fig. 8 for different values of \u0393=M. At resonance masses around 1-2 TeV, the value of the excluded cross section slightly increases with the resonance width, as expected from the gradual widening of the core of the resonance approximately independent of the tail. For large resonance masses, the exclusion limit for wide resonances is worse than the narrow resonance limits by at least one order of magnitude. This different behavior is caused by the enhancement in the low-mass tail of the dijet mass signal shape from partons with low fractional momentum, which is more important for high-mass resonances. Nevertheless, the analysis TABLE IV. Observed 95% C.L. upper limits on \u03c3BA as a function of resonance mass for several values of the width-to-mass ratio \u0393=M, computed for qq \u2192 G \u2192 qq and gg \u2192 G \u2192 gg. The missing entries correspond to the region where the two conditions for the validity of the wide resonance analysis are not satisfied (see text).  Table IV for qq and gg final states. The limits are quoted for a range of masses and widths that satisfies two conditions: (i) at low resonance mass, the core of the signal shape is preserved after the trigger selection m jj > 890 GeV, (ii) at high resonance mass, the presence of the low-mass tails in the signal shape does not significantly affect the limit value. This latter condition is enforced by requiring that the expected limit derived for a truncated signal shape is close to that derived for the full shape, within the typical uncertainty of 30% in the expected limits. The truncated shape is cut off at 85% of the nominal resonance mass, and the corresponding limit corrected for the difference in acceptance because of the truncation. We present below an example, illustrating how to use these generic upper limits on the cross section to set lower mass limits for specific models of wide resonances. The axigluon/coloron and S8 resonances represent good benchmark models for this study, having relative widths \u0393=M equal to \u03b1 S and 5=6\u03b1 S , respectively (where \u03b1 S is the SM strong coupling evaluated at an energy scale equal to the resonance mass). \u0393=M is therefore between 5% and 10%, slightly decreasing with the increase in the resonance mass because of the running of the strong coupling constant. New cross section upper limits for axigluon/ coloron and S8 resonances are produced, which are, respectively, a linear interpolation between the \u0393=M \u00bc 5% and 10% qq and gg limits reported in Table IV. The resulting cross section upper limits are shown in Fig. 9 where they are compared to theoretical predictions to extract the lower mass limits on axigluon/coloron and S8 resonances reported in Table III. More details on the cross section calculations for wide resonances are reported in the Appendix. ",

The dijet invariant mass distribution expected from QBH decays is used here, in place of the resonance line shape employed in the other analyses. The required mass shapes are modeled using the QBH (v1.07) matrix-element generator [58] with the CTEQ6L1 PDF set [48], followed by the parton showering simulation with PYTHIA 8 and a parametric, fast simulation of the CMS detector [57]. The signal is characterized by a peak in the reconstructed dijet mass spectrum, as shown in Fig. 10. The peak position is related to the minimum mass of QBHs, M min QBH . The relatively narrow shape is a consequence of the convolution of the thresholdlike production behavior for QBHs with the steeply falling parton luminosity as a function of the subprocess center-of-mass energy. The low-mass dijet tails are due to detector resolution effects.  V. Observed 95% C.L. upper limits on \u03c3BA for QBHs from the inclusive analysis.

The inclusive search has been conducted for narrow resonances and, for the first time, for wide resonances with relative widths up to 30% of the resonance mass. No evidence for new particle production is found. Upper limits at 95% C.L. on the product of the cross section, branching fraction into dijets, and acceptance are provided for all generic searches. Specific lower limits are set on the masses of string resonances, excited quarks, axigluons, colorons, color-octet scalar resonances, scalar diquarks, W 0 and Z 0 bosons, and RS gravitons. For the first time, an exclusion limit is set for excited b quarks. The lower mass limits reach up to 5 TeV, depending on the model, and extend previous exclusions based on the dijet mass search technique. Quantum black holes up to a mass ranging from 5.0 to 6.3 TeV are also excluded at 95% C.L., depending on the model.",

The s-channel process, the annihilation of two initial state partons into the resonance, is usually the most significant contribution and is the process searched for by this analysis. The s-channel cross section is evaluated by replacing the delta function in Eq. (A1) with a full relativistic Breit-Wigner resonance shape, before integrating over the PDFs. The t-channel process, where the new particle is exchanged between the incoming partons, often has an appreciable contribution to the cross section but it does not peak sharply in diparton mass and may be absorbed into the background shape during a search. The interference process, including interference between the multijet background processes and both the sand t-channel signal processes, could often significantly modify the resonance shape far off the resonance pole. Interference contributions depend on the type of resonance considered and are not included in the resonance shape used in our search. Our calculation of the wide resonance cross section is an approximation that considers only the s-channel term, to which limits from our search should be compared.",

(A4) significantly affects the resonance shape far away from the resonance pole, suppressing the tail at low diparton mass. This term is appropriate for resonances that have a width proportional to the cube of the resonance mass, like the RS graviton or the color-octet scalar. Even with this suppression, the enhancement at low dijet mass due to convolution of the tail with PDFs is visible in Fig. 7 for resonances with the highest widths and masses. We calculate the full wide resonance cross section from s-channel production by integrating the Breit-Wigner resonance shape defined by Eqs. (A2)-(A4), over the PDFs. Table VII shows the full cross section divided by the cross section in the narrow-width approximation as a function of the resonance mass and width, for both qq and gg resonances. This ratio is close to unity for narrow resonances, for which the full cross section and the narrowwidth approximation cross section are naturally the same. For wide resonances at high resonance mass this ratio can be significantly greater than 1, because the convolution of the PDFs with the low mass tail of the Breit-Wigner result in a large cross section at low diparton mass. For wide resonances the values reported in Table VII can be applied as a multiplicative correction to the narrow-width approximation cross sections to get an appropriate resonance cross section to compare with our experimental upper limits on cross section. This is done in Fig. 9 to obtain the model cross section presented and to set mass limits for axigluons/ colorons and color-octet scalars. The correction factor for axigluons, which are qq resonances of width \u0393 R \u00bc \u03b1 S M X , is 1.1 at a mass of 3.5 TeV. The correction factor for coloroctet scalars, which are gg resonances of width \u0393 R \u00bc 5\u03b1 S M X =6, is 1.1 at a mass of 2.5 TeV. So for these resonances, at mass values close to our mass limit, the full cross section is close to the cross section calculated in the narrow-width approximation. We recommend the same procedure, using Table VII, for users of our limits on the wide-resonance cross section, as this will ensure that the resonance shape used to calculate the cross section matches the resonance shape we used to set limits.",

This shape at low dijet mass would be largely absorbed into the multijet background definition of our search. Like the multijet background, the full cross section for this wide shape is mainly determined by the lowest diparton mass considered. This shape is therefore difficult to use in a well-defined fashion in a search that sets upper limits on a resonance cross section, because the cross section is only weakly dependent on the resonance pole mass. Thus, we have limited the wide resonance search to the shape defined by Eq. (A4). Our wide resonance search results are still applicable for a range of resonance widths and masses even for resonances that have a shape defined by Eq. (A5). As long as the full cross section for the true resonance line shape integrated over the mass interval of the CMS search is not larger than about 20 times the narrow-width approximation cross section, the results of the CMS search are approximately valid and applicable. This approximate range of validity is derived by comparing Table IV with VII. The boundary of validity of the limits shown in Table IV has an average ratio value of about 20 in Table VII. Note that our limits are valid if the condition reported in Sec. VI holds so that the low mass tail does not significantly affect the shape analysis. Thus, to first approximation, only this comparison of the full resonance cross section to the narrow width cross section matters in determining validity of our limits, independent of the shape of the low mass tail.",
