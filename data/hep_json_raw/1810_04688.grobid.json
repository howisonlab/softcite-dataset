            "text": "The GlueX experiment in Hall D at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility was designed to further understand the nature of confinement in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). The main avenue toward this goal is a careful mapping of the light-quark meson spectrum. It is believed that the soft gluon field in QCD can give rise to \"hybrid\" mesons in which the glue is excited to carry part of the quantum numbers (J PC ) of the states [1,2]. This would be revealed by either an overpopulation of particular spin-parity multiplets, or by the observation of quantum states excluded in the standard quark picture based on flavor-spin-rotation symmetry and the standard model gauge symmetries of S U(3) \u00d7 S U(2) \u00d7 U (1).",

Angular correlations of the produced pairs may offer clues to their production process, and momentum or invariant mass distributions of the produced pairs in their pair rest frames may lead to insight about their interaction potentials. For instance, looking for \"baryonium\" in the pp system has a long history at CERN and elsewhere [3], albeit with no continuum quasi-bound states found. We will have the possibility of looking for structure in the \u039b\u039b and p\u039b systems. The self-analyzing weak decay of the hyperons will allow investigations of the spin correlations in the produced pairs, something that is not practicable in the proton-anti-proton case. There seems to be very little theoretical work done on photoproduction of eitherpp or\u039b\u039b pairs. At GlueX energies one expects that most reactions proceed through a peripheral process dominated by t-channel exchange of mesons, Pomerons, or some sort of Reggeons. This is illustrated in Fig. 1 for the case of hyperon pair production. We refer the reader to Gutsche et al. [4] for the only model calculations available at this time. It allows both vector (\u03c1, \u03c9) and axial vector (b 1 , h 1 ) mesons as well as Reggeons in the t-channel. It further assumes that the baryon pair is the decay product of intermediate scalar mesons f 0 (1370), f 0 (1500) and f 0 (1710) at the upper vertex shown in Fig. 1. The two reactions are treated in the same way, apart from the couplings to the final state baryons, leading to very similar predictions for the t dependence of the cross section and the beam spin asymmetry, \u03a3. The posited intermediate scalars are all sub-threshold for the two reactions, which suggests that there could be, or ought to be, more intermediate states at higher masses. Experiment will tell. Thus, at the present time it is not known what the production mechanism is, including whether the hyperon pair is produced in the decay of intermediate mesonic state(s) at the upper vertex. If they were produced from the decay of intermediate state(s), then indeed it would be of interest to look at all available spin observables. This includes the beam spin asymmetry, \u03a3, that is accessible with linearly polarized photons. This is determined using the azimuthal event asymmetry around the plane of photon polarization. The first publication by GlueX was reported by Al Ghoul et al. [5], a measurement of the \u03a3 observable for \u03c0 0 and \u03b7 production with about 100 times the statistics of the only previous measurements at SLAC, from decades ago. This observable can also be measured for the hyperon reaction; we are not presenting preliminary results for this observable here, however, since event statistics are not yet sufficient.",

Strong CP invariance demands that the weak decay asymmetries of the pair are opposite: \u03b1 = \u2212\u1fb1. CPT invariance requires the lifetimes of the pair to be equal: \u03c4 \u039b = \u03c4\u039b.

For these measurements, an 11.6 GeV electron beam impinges on a diamond radiator which produces a \"coherent\" Bremsstrahlung real photon beam with a substantial linear polarization in a narrow energy range peaking at 9 GeV. After collimation, the degree of polarization in the coherent peak is about 40%, while the rest of the energy spectrum is unpolarized. Recoiling electrons are analyzed using a dipole \"tagging\" magnet and a fine-grained hodoscope scintillator array to define the photon energy. The beam quality, flux, and polarization are monitored upstream of the main detector using an e + e \u2212 pair spectrometer and a triplet polarimeter (not shown). A \u223c30 cm liquid hydrogen physics target is located in the 2 Tesla solenoidal magnetic field. Charged particles produced in this fixed-target setup are mostly forward-directed in the laboratory frame. Charged particles are tracked by a straw-tube central drift chamber with axial geometry but including small-angle (6 \u2022 ) \"stereo\" layers. Planar drift chambers in the forward direction further track charged particles. The time of flight (TOF) of forward-going charged massive particles is measured using a scintillator Start Counter that surrounds the target combined with a forward TOF scintillator wall. Photons and electrons are detected in a lead/scintillator fiber Barrel Calorimeter inside the magnet and a lead-glass Forward Colorimeter. These latter two detectors also detect the arrival of charged particles; the trigger for the event readout requires a minimum summed energy to be deposited in the two calorimeters.",

Kinematic fitting was used on all possible particle identification combinations of these tracks and using all in-time photons in the tagger.

The first constrained overall energy and momentum conservation and had constraints on the primary and secondary (decay) vertices. The second fit likewise constrained overall energy and momentum in the event, the three vertices, but in addition constrained the hyperon masses. After the kinematic fitting, further particle identification (PID) cuts were made on individual tracks to separate pions from protons. These included dE/dx cuts in the central drift chamber, where pions and protons could be separated up to about 1 GeV/c. Timing cuts between the target and TOF wall were made, where pions and protons could be separated up to about 5 GeV/c. The four nanosecond photon arrival-time microstructure of the CEBAF beam in Hall D was used to help select the best beam photon candidate for each event. The distributions of invariant masses for the reconstructed \u039b \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 p and the\u039b \u2192 \u03c0 +p states are shown in Fig. 3. At this stage, all dE/dx and timing cuts were applied to individual tracks and a 1% confidence level cut was made on the kinematic fit result.

Separate \"\u00b13 sigma\" cuts on each state were made, or 18 MeV in total, but the remaining background under the states due to beam-tagging and hadronic particle mis-identification has not been subtracted in the subsequent plots.

The two distributions would look the same if the diagram in Fig. 1 were the whole story: the hyperons would be produced \"symmetrically\" in their pair rest frame, due to parity conservation, and projected into the CM frame with the same angular distribution. Instead, both distributions have a forward peak, but the \u039b distribution has a second peak at back angles. A caveat here is that these spectra have not yet had beam-tagging accidentals removed (which is thought not to affect the spectral shapes), nor has the \"sideband\" background seen in FIGURE 4. The overall center-of-mass frame angular distribution of events of the \u039b particles (left) and the corresponding distribution for the\u039b particles (right). One notes that both hyperons are forward peaked, but that the \u039b particles also have a peak in the backward direction. These spectra have not been acceptance corrected or background subtracted. Fig. 3 been carefully removed (as mentioned above). However, we have checked (not shown here) that the background under the hyperon signal is not backward peaked. This difference hints that at least two reaction mechanisms are in play in this reaction. Further evidence of this is provided by the CM angular distribution of the remaining final-state proton, which is shown in Fig. 5(left). These protons are backward peaked with a second peak in the forward direction, mirroring the \u039b distribution in Fig. 4. Indeed, the backward protons are correlated with the forward \u039b particles, as seen in Fig. 5 (right).",

In the first instance, a non-strange exchange occurs in the t channel, possibly including the Pomeron, \u03c0, and \u03c1. This creates the hyperon and anti-hyperon together at the upper vertex which, as a pair, would be dominantly seen at low t and be symmetrically distributed. In the second instance, a strange exchange occurs in the t channel, which converts the target proton into a recoiling \u039b that appears at back angles in the CM frame. Meanwhile, at the top vertex a p\u039b pair is created at low t that appears at small CM angles. We have checked that the t dependence of the respective pairs looks exponential, i.e. goes as e bt , but before proper background subtraction and acceptance corrections we do not show these distributions here. It would be very interesting to have model predictions to test this phenomenology. Figure 7 shows the photon energy distribution for all events in the final \u039b\u039b spectra.

It has been shown that the hyperon angular distributions indicate that more than one distinct reaction mechanism is at work, and that we believe the evidence points to non-strange and strange meson exchange in the t channel. However, presently no substantive theoretical effort has been made to support this inference. All spectra shown here are very preliminary, having yet to undergo careful background subtraction and acceptance correction. Using the capabilities of the Hall D polarized beam and the GlueX detector, we expect to produce differential cross sections and various spin observables. The hyperons' self-analyzing weak decays will allow various tests of the production mechanism. Comparison to the pp reaction will be made over the same ranges of energy and angle: the event statistics are several orders of magnitude greater, but no spin information other than \u03a3 can be obtained. We hope to have stimulated some interest from the theory community to examine this reaction in detail.",
