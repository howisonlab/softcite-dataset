The final state studied consists of a merged jet pair and a \u03c4 pair resulting from the decays of Z and H bosons, respectively. The analysis is based on a data sample of proton-proton collisions at a center-ofmass energy of 8 TeV, collected with the CMS experiment in 2012, and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb \u22121 . In the resonance mass range of interest, which extends from 0.8 to 2.5 TeV, the Z and H bosons are produced with large momenta, which implies that the final products of the two quarks or the two \u03c4 leptons must be detected within a small angular interval. From a combination of all possible decay modes of the \u03c4 leptons, production cross sections in a range between 0.9 and 27.8 fb are excluded at 95% confidence level, depending on the resonance mass.",

            "text": "Very recently, the validity of the standard model (SM) of particle physics has been confirmed by the discovery of a Higgs boson with mass near 125 GeV by the ATLAS and CMS experiments [1,2]. Though the SM successfully describes a broad range of high energy phenomena, the solution to remaining problems with the structure of the SM, particularly the hierarchy problem, leads naturally to the introduction of physics beyond the standard model (BSM), possibly at the TeV scale [3][4][5][6][7][8]. Many of the BSM models predict the existence of heavy resonances with masses of the order of a TeV, which may have sizable couplings to the gauge and Higgs boson fields of the SM [9][10][11][12]. We consider here one important family among these models, which incorporate composite Higgs bosons [11,12]. In these models, the Higgs boson is a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson of a broken global symmetry. Other composite bound states beyond the Higgs boson are expected to exist and could be experimentally observed.",

The cross sections and branching fractions (B) for the heavy triplet model depend on the new physics scenario under study and can be characterized by three parameters in the phenomenological Lagrangian: the strength of the couplings to fermions c F , to the Higgs c H , and the self-coupling g V . In the case of a strongly coupled sector, the new heavy resonance has larger couplings to the W, Z, and H bosons, resulting in larger branching fractions for the diboson final states.

The transverse energy of a jet is defined as the reconstructed energy multiplied by the sine of the polar angle of the jet axis. Using events selected by less restrictive, pre-scaled triggers, it has been verified that the efficiency of this trigger after applying the offline event selection is above 99%. The difference from 100% is considered as a systematic uncertainty.",

In these algorithms the original jets are re-clustered by removing pileup and underlying-event particles at low-p T and large angle. The term pileup refers to additional interactions occurring in the same LHC bunch crossing. We define m P jet as the invariant mass of the jet constituents after the pruning procedure. This invariant mass provides good discrimination between Z-jets and quark/gluon-jets since it tends to be shifted towards the energy scale at which the jet was produced. We also define a quantity called \"N-subjettiness\", \u03c4 N , that is sensitive to the different jet substructure characteristics of quark/gluon and Zjets, as [44]: (1) where N is the number of subjets in which the original jet can be reclustered with the k T algorithm [45,46]; the index k runs over the PF constituents of the jet; p T,k is the transverse momentum of the kth constituent;",

At the next-to-last step of the clustering algorithm, there are two subjets, which are ordered by mass. If both have p T > 10 GeV and the mass of the leading subjet is smaller than 2/3 of the mass of the original merged jet, the two objects are used as seeding jets for \u03c4 lepton reconstruction via the \"hadron-plus-strips\" technique. If any of the criteria above fail, the procedure for one of the subjets is performed again for a maximum of four iterations. The efficiency for finding subjets with this method in signal events is 92%, independent of p T , for \u03c4 h with p T > 40 GeV. In the lowest bin investigated (p T between 20 and 40 GeV) the efficiency is around 80%.",

For the all-leptonic and semileptonic channels, additional uncertainties come from the procedure of removing nearby tracks and leptons used in the hadronic \u03c4 reconstruction, and from the isolation variable computation in the case of boosted topologies. The inefficiency resulting from these procedures, as measured in signal simulation, is assigned as a systematic uncertainty, corresponding to 1-16% for \u03c4 reconstruction and 1-21% for isolation. In the all-hadronic analysis, a constant uncertainty of 10% is assigned for the application of the \u03c4 reconstruction procedure to collimated subjets, comparing the performance for isolated and non-isolated \u03c4 leptons in simulation. The jet trigger efficiency has an uncertainty of <1%, as determined from a less selective trigger. Following the method derived for vector boson identification in merged jets [58], a scale factor of 0.94 \u00b1 0.06 is used for the efficiency of the pruning and subjet searching techniques applied on the CA jet, where the uncertainty is included in the estimation of the overall systematic uncertainty. For the b tagging, data-to-MC corrections derived from several control samples are applied and the uncertainties on these corrections are propagated as systematic uncertainties in the analysis (2-6%). The procedure used to derive the b-tagging systematic uncertainties is described in Ref. [54].",
