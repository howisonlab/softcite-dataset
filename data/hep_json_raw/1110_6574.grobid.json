The MiniBooNE experiment is a short baseline neutrino oscillation experiment [1,2] at Fermilab. At MiniBooNE NCE interactions account for 17% of total events in the \u03bd mode and around 14% in\u03bd mode. In MiniBooNE, neutrino interactions are simulated with the NUANCE-v3 event generator [3] where a relativistic Fermi gas (RFG) model of Smith and Moniz [4] is used to characterize the NCE process. Within this model, two parameters are employed: the nucleon axial mass M A and the NCE scattering strange quark contribution to the axial form factor, \u2206s. Nuclear effects can make the axial mass an \"effective\" value and not the same as scattering from individual nucleons. MiniBooNE can run in both \u03bd or\u03bd modes by virtue of a magnetic horn which sign selects charged mesons.",

Even though the ratio \u03bd p \u2192 \u03bd p to \u03bdn \u2192 \u03bdn (n being neutron) is more sensitive to \u2206s [7], in MiniBooNE a neutron can only be detected if it has a further strong interaction with a proton, which at low energies is difficult to distinguish from single proton events. Hence a sample of single protons above 350 MeV (the Cerenkov threshold for protons in MiniBooNE) was used and the ratio of \u03bd p \u2192 \u03bd p to \u03bdN \u2192 \u03bdN (N being nucleon) as a function of reconstructed nucleon energy from 350 MeV to 800 MeV was studied to measure \u2206s (Fig. 3). Additionally looking at such a ratio reduces the effect of FSIs and also some systematic errors. Assuming M A = 1.39 \u00b1 0.11 GeV the \u03c7 2 tests of \u2206s to MiniBooNE measured \u03bd p \u2192 \u03bd p/\u03bdN \u2192 \u03bdN gives: \u2206s = 0.08 \u00b1 0.26 with \u03c7 2 min /DOF=34.7/29. This is consistent with the BNL E734 measurement [8]. To facilitate a comparison between the MiniBooNE CCQE differential cross section [6] and the NCE measurement, a NCE/CCQE ratio as a function of Q 2 QE was extracted. MiniBooNE measures the two cross sections differently-in case of CCQE, Q 2 QE is defined from outgoing muon kinematics and assuming a stationary neutron. The ratio measurement also reduces the flux uncertainties. Fig. 4(left) shows the measured ratio with the MC prediction for the same. This is the first time such a ratio measurement has been made.   Fig. 4(right) shows the NCE-like/CCQE-like ratio which is a more model independent comparison made by not subtracting the non-elastic backgrounds from the signal in both measurements in the ratio. Also shown is the MC prediction with different values of M A and \u03ba.",
