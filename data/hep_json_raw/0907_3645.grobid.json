One angle, \u03c6 1 (or \u03b2 ) 1 , has been measured with high precision at BaBar and Belle experiments, the B factories operated at the e + e \u2212 colliders with the center-of-mass energy at \u03d2(4S) resonance. The measurements of the angle \u03c6 2 /\u03b1 is more difficult due to theoretical uncertainties in the calculation of the penguin diagram contribution. Precise determination of the third angle, \u03c6 3 /\u03b3, is possible, e.g., in the decays B \u00b1 \u2192 DK \u00b1 . Although it is theoretically clean due to the absence of loop contributions, it requires a lot more data than for the other angles. This report summarizes the most recent progress in measuring the angle \u03c6 3 /\u03b3.",

To suppressed the increased background a high momentum lepton is required in the event. This lepton also provides the information about the flavor and decay vertex of the tagging B meson, which is necessary for the time-dependent analysis. The vertex of the signal B is reconstructed using 'fast' pion only. The fit results using the partial reconstruction method are: ",
