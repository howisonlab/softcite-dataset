The ICAL experiment will be able to determine the precision of atmospheric neutrino mixing parameters and neutrino mass hierarchy using atmospheric muon neutrinos through the earth matter effect. In this paper, we report on the sensitivity for the atmospheric neutrino mixing parameters (sin 2 \u03b8 23 and | m 2 32 |) and octant sensitivity for the ICAL detector using the reconstructed neutrino energy and muon direction as observables. We apply realistic resolutions and efficiencies obtained by the ICAL collaboration with a GEANT4-based simulation to reconstruct neutrino energy and muon direction. Our study shows that using neutrino energy and muon direction as observables for a \u03c7 2 analysis, the ICAL detector can measure sin 2 \u03b8 23 and | m 2 32 | with 13 % and 4 % uncertainties at 1\u03c3 confidence level and can rule out the wrong octant of \u03b8 23 with 2\u03c3 confidence level for 10 years of exposure.",

In the standard framework of oscillations, the neutrino flavor states are linear superpositions of the mass eigenstates with well defined masses:",

The atmospheric oscillation parameters m 2 32 and \u03b8 23 were first constrained by the Super-Kamiokande [1] experiment.

Recently, the DAYA Bay [19], RENO [20], MINOS [24] and T2K [25] experiments have measured the third mixing angle \u03b8 13 .

India-based Neutrino Observatory (INO) is an approved project to construct an underground laboratory to be located at Theni district in southern India. The ICAL detector at INO will study mainly the atmospheric muon neutrinos and antineutrinos. Because of being magnetised, the ICAL detector can easily distinguish between atmospheric \u03bd \u03bc and\u03bd \u03bc by identifying the charge of muons produced in Charged-Current interactions of these neutrinos in the detector. Reconfirmation of atmospheric neutrino oscillations, precision measurement of oscillation parameters and the determination of neutrino mass hierarchy through the observation of earth matter effects in atmospheric neutrinos are the primary physics goals of the INO-ICAL experiment. Matter effects in neutrino oscillations are sensitive to the sign of m 2 32 . Though the ICAL experiment is insensitive to \u03b4 [37], it has been observed that INO mass hierarchy results together with other experiments can help to determine the value of \u03b4 [38].",

The sensitivity of the ICAL experiment for these oscillation parameters has already been studied by binning the events in the muon energy and muon angle, using realistic muon resolutions and efficiencies [39]. Here, however, we use a different approach to determine the sensitivity of the ICAL detector for the atmospheric neutrino mixing parameters. When an atmospheric \u03bd \u03bc (\u03bd \u03bc ) interacts with the ICAL detector, it pro-duces a \u03bc + (\u03bc \u2212 ) and a shower of hadrons. In order to extract the full information about the parent neutrino, information of muons along with that of hadrons is used in the analysis. Recently, it has been shown that including hadron information together with the muon events improves the ICAL potential for the measurement of neutrino mass hierarchy [40,41]. Since the neutrino energy cannot be measured directly, therefore, in the analysis presented here, the neutrino energy is obtained by adding the energy deposited by the muons and hadron inside the ICAL detector. We then use this neutrino energy (E \u03bd ) and muon angle (cos \u03b8 \u03bc ) as observables for the \u03c7 2 estimation. An earlier analysis have used hadron information, but with constant resolutions to obtain the neutrino energy [42]. In the present work, we show the ICAL potential for the neutrino oscillation parameters using effective realistic ICAL detector resolutions.",

ICAL consists of 151 horizontal layers of 5.6 cm iron plates with 4 cm of gap between two successive iron layers. Gaseous detectors called Resistive Plate Chambers (RPCs) of dimension 2 m \u00d7 2 m will be used as active detector elements and will be interleaved in the iron layer gap. RPC detectors are known for their good time resolution (\u223c1 ns) and spatial resolution (\u223c3 cm). The RPCs provide two dimensional readouts through the external copper pick up strips placed above and below the detector. Total mass of the detector is approximately 50 kt which will provide the statistically significant data to study the weakly interacting neutrinos. A magnetic field of upto 1.5 T will be generated through the solenoidal shaped coils placed around the detector [45,46].

The interactions of atmospheric muon neutrino and anti-neutrino fluxes with the detector target are simulated by the NUANCE neutrino generator for 1000 years of exposure of the 50 kt ICAL detector. For the purpose of quoting the final sensitivity we normalise the 1000 years data to 10 years of exposure to keep Monte Carlo fluctuations under control; following a similar approach used in the earlier ICAL analyses [37,39]. The ICAL is highly sensitive to charged-current (CC) interactions where charged muons produced along with the hadron shower can be identified clearly though the RPC detectors. Since the resolutions and efficiencies studies for such events have been done by the INO collaboration [46,48] and are available, only the events generated through CC interactions are considered for the present analysis. It has been estimated that the background from the neutral current (NC) interactions for a magnetised iron neutrino detector (MIND), similar to ICAL, can be reduced to the level of about a percent, and the contribution of \u03bd \u03bc \u2192 \u03bd \u03c4 oscillation background is between 1-4 % [49]. Therefore, we have neglected these effects in the current analysis for the time being. Neutrino oscillations can be incorporated into the NUANCE code to generate the oscillated neutrino flux at the detector for different values of the oscillation parameters. However, this process requires large computational time and resources. Therefore, we simulate the interactions of atmospheric neutrinos with the detector in the absence of oscillations and the effect of oscillations is included by using the re-weighting algorithm described in Refs. [37,39]. For each neutrino event of a given energy E \u03bd and zenith direction \u03b8 z , oscillation probabilities are estimated taking earth matter effects into account. The path length traversed by neutrinos from the production point to the detector, which is needed as an input parameter in the oscillation probability estimation, is obtained as:",

Reconstruction of the neutrino energy requires the reconstruction of muon as well as hadron energy. Once we have the reconstructed muon and hadron energies, we directly add them together to get the final reconstructed neutrino energy. Muon and hadron energy resolutions have been obtained by the INO collaboration as a function of true energies and true directions of muons or hadrons using a GEANT4 [44] based code [39,46]. Muons give a clear track of hits inside the magnetised detector, therefore the energy of muons can be reconstructed easily using a track fitting algorithm. It was observed that the muons energy reconstructed by the ICAL detector follows a Gaussian distribution for E \u03bc \u2265 1 GeV whereas it follows a Landau distribution for E \u03bc < 1 GeV. On the other hand, hadrons do not travel too far in the ICAL and hence they feel a negligible effect of the magnetic field before depositing their energies in a shower like pattern [48]. The total energy deposited by the hadron shower (E had = E \u03bd \u2212 E \u03bc ) has been used to calibrate the detector response. It has been found that hadron hit patterns follow a Vavilov distribution [50]. The hadron energy resolution has been fitted as a function of E had [48]. In the present analy- sis, muon energy and angular resolutions are implemented by smearing the true muon energy and direction of each \u03bc + and \u03bc \u2212 event using the ICAL muon resolution functions [46]. True hadron Energies are smeared using the ICAL hadron resolution functions [48]. Reconstructed neutrino energy is then taken as the sum of smeared muon and hadron energy. Figure 1 shows the true and reconstructed neutrino and antineutrino energies obtained from the \u03bd \u03bc \u2192 \u03bd \u03bc channel while Fig. 2 shows the same for \u03bd e \u2192 \u03bd \u03bc channel. It can be seen that at lower incoming neutrino energies (E \u03bd \u2264 1), reconstruction of neutrino energy at ICAL is poor due to the effect of detector resolutions in this range.",

The current study shows that ICAL is capable of measuring the atmospheric mixing angle sin 2 \u03b8 23 with a precision of 13, 21 and 27 %, at 1\u03c3 , 2\u03c3 and 3\u03c3 confidence levels respectively. The atmospheric mass square splitting | m 2 32 | can be measured with a precision of 4, 8 and 12 % at 1 \u03c3 , 2 \u03c3 and 3 \u03c3 confidence levels respectively. These numbers show an improvement of 20 and 23 % on the precision measurement of sin 2 \u03b8 23 and | m 2 32 | parameters respectively at 1\u03c3 level over muon energy and muon direction analysis [39]. These results shows that the inclusion of hadron information together with muon information significantly improves the capability of the ICAL detector for the estimation of oscillation parameters. These results may further be improved by including the neutrino direction in the \u03c7 2 definition, a work under progress in the INO collaboration.  Figure 5 show the \u03c7 2 plot for the identification of octant sensitivity for different true values of sin 2 \u03b8 23 assuming Normal hierarchy. It can be seen from this figure that using neutrino energy and muon direction as two dimensional observables, ICAL can identify the lower octant when sin 2 \u03b8 23 < 0.46 (sin 2 \u03b8 23 < 0.40) with 1\u03c3 (2\u03c3 ) confidence levels. Similarly, the higher octant can be identified when sin 2 \u03b8 23 > 0.58 (sin 2 \u03b8 23 > 0.63) with 1\u03c3 (2\u03c3 ) confidence levels. It has also been observed that the ICAL sensitivity deteriorates on approaching the \u03b8 23 closer to its maximal mixing value (sin 2 \u03b8 23 = 0.5).",

We have studied the ICAL detector capability for the precise measurement of atmospheric neutrino oscillation parameters using neutrino energy and muon angle as observables. A Monte Carlo simulation using NUANCE generated neutrino data for 10 years exposure of the ICAL detector has been carried out. The analysis has been performed in the framework of three neutrino flavor mixing and by taking the earth matter effect into account. A marginalised \u03c7 2 analysis in fine bins of reconstructed neutrino energy and muon angle has been performed. Realistic detector resolutions and efficiencies, generated from ICAL detector simulation have been utilised. The effect of various systematic uncertainties have also been included in the analysis.",

The octant sensitivity study shows that ICAL is able to discrimante the octant of \u03b8 23 with a significance of 2\u03c3 for 10 year exposure.
