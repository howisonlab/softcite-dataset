The \u03a5 mesons are reconstructed in the decay mode \u03a5 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 . The differential production cross-sections times the dimuon branching fractions are measured as a function of the \u03a5 transverse momentum, p T , and rapidity, y, over the range 0 < p T < 30 GeV/c and 2.0 < y < 4.5. The ratios of the cross-sections with respect to the LHCb measurement at \u221a s = 8 TeV are also determined. The measurements are compared with theoretical predictions based on NRQCD.",

            "text": "The study of heavy quarkonium (cc and bb) production in high-energy hadron collisions provides important information to better understand quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Thanks to theoretical and experimental efforts in the past forty years, the comprehension of hadronic production of heavy quarkonia has been improved significantly. The production of heavy quarkonium in proton-proton (pp) collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is expected to start with the production of a heavy quark pair, QQ, followed by its hadronization into a bound state. The heavy quark pair QQ is produced mainly via Leading Order (LO) gluon-gluon interactions. Several models have been proposed to describe the underlying dynamics, such as the colour-singlet model (CSM) [1][2][3][4][5][6][7] and non-relativistic QCD (NRQCD) [8][9][10]. In the CSM the intermediate QQ state is supposed to be colourless and has the same quantum numbers as the quarkonium final state, while in NRQCD the calculations also include the colour-octet contribution. However, at present no model can describe both the heavy quarkonium production cross-section and polarisation simultaneously.",

The detector includes a high-precision tracking system consisting of a silicon-strip vertex detector surrounding the pp interaction region [27], a large-area silicon-strip detector located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4 Tm, and three stations of silicon-strip detectors and straw drift tubes [28] placed downstream of the magnet. The tracking system provides a measurement of momentum, p, of charged particles with a relative uncertainty that varies from 0.5% at low momentum to 1.0% at 200 GeV/c. The minimum distance of a track to a primary vertex, the impact parameter, is measured with a resolution of (15 + 29/p T ) \u00b5m, where p T is expressed in GeV/c. Different types of charged hadrons are distinguished using information from two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors [29]. Photons, electrons and hadrons are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad (SPD) and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter and a hadronic calorimeter. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers [30].",

The online event selection is performed by a trigger system [31] that consists of a hardware stage selecting dimuon candidates with the product of the transverse momenta of the muons greater than (1.3 GeV/c) 2 , followed by a two-stage software selection based on the information available after full event reconstruction. In the software trigger, two muons with p > 6 GeV/c, p T > 300 MeV/c are selected to form a \u03a5 candidate. These two muon candidates are required to form a common vertex [32] with an invariant mass M > 4.7 GeV/c 2 . To reject high-multiplicity events with a large number of pp interactions, a set of global event requirements [31] is applied, which includes the requirement that the number of hits in the SPD subdetector be less than 900. In between the first and second stages of the software trigger, the alignment and calibration of the detector is performed nearly in real-time [33] and updated constants are made available for the trigger. The same alignment and calibration information is propagated to the offline reconstruction, ensuring",
