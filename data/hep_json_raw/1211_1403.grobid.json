However, experimental results from direct Dark Matter searches, (e.g. DAMA/LIBRA) [1][2][3][4] and other experimental observations that may be interpreted as deviations from the Standard Model (e.g. g-2 [5]), can be explained in the Dark Matter (DM) models by the inclusion of an additional interaction, a dark U(1) interaction [6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16]. This interaction, which is mediated by a dark U (1) boson, also known as the \"Dark Photon\", typically has very small couplings to Standard Model particles.",

The decay length of the dark photon is a function of the dark photon coupling strength to Standard Model fermions and is proportional to the inverse of the square of the dark photon coupling. The decay length of the dark Higgs varies for m h \u2032 > 2m A between being prompt and one meter. In the Higgs-strahlung channel, two couplings are involved: the electromagnetic coupling of the dark photon to the Standard Model fermions, \u03b1 \u2032 ; and the dark photon coupling to the dark Higgs, \u03b1 D . KLOE and BaBar reported their searches on the dark photon and the dark Higgs [25] and [26] (see also contribution of B. Oberhof to these proceed-ings [27]). KLOE focused their search on m h \u2032 < m A and BaBar on m h \u2032 > 2m A (and with A and h \u2032 prompt), but no signal was found. Only BaBar could set limits for the highest mass range, 0.8 < m h \u2032 < 10.0 GeV/c 2 and 0.25 < m A < 3.0 GeV/c 2 . BaBar looked at two types of final states, fully reconstructed (3l + l \u2212 , 2l + 2l \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and 2\u03c0 + 2\u03c0 \u2212 l + l \u2212 where l = e, \u00b5); and partially reconstructed (2\u00b5 + 2\u00b5 \u2212 X and e + e \u2212 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 X, where X denotes any final state other than a pair of pions or leptons). The reason to look for partially reconstructed final states is that above m A > 1 GeV/c 2 , final states with hadrons dominate assuming BF(A \u2192 e + e \u2212 ) + BF(A \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) + BF(A \u2192 hadrons) = 1 and that BF(A\u2192hadrons) BF(A\u2192\u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) = R, where R is the hadronic cross section ratio, R = \u03c3(e + e \u2212 \u2192hadrons)",

An iron flux-return (KLM) located outside the coil is optimized to detect K 0 L mesons and to identify muons. A detailed description can be found in [35].
