The available experimental results of the analysis of final states including most of the possible two-object combinations of W and Z bosons, photons, Higgs bosons, and gluons place stringent constraints on a variety of theoretical ideas that extend the standard model, pushing into the multi-TeV region the scale of allowed new physics phenomena.",

            "text": "Our current understanding of subnuclear physics is enshrined in the standard model (SM) , a theoretical construction based on the SU (3) C \u00d7 SU (2) L \u00d7 U (1) Y gauge group. The SM describes in detail electromagnetic, weak, and strong interactions of elementary fermions, and allows for the self-interaction of some of the interaction carriers, according to the structure of the relative gauge groups. The model, first constructed in the sixties of the past century [1,2,3,4,5,6], includes a scalar field that enables the spontaneous breaking of electroweak symmetry, thus allowing for non-zero mass terms for a triplet of weak bosons in the Lagrangian density [7,8,9]. After the proof of its renormalizability [10] and the discovery of weak neutral currents [11], the model was accepted as the standard theory of electroweak interactions. Following a string of increasingly accurate verifications of theory predictions in the description of the physics of subnuclear collisions , which confirmed its validity, the SM was finally crowned by the 2012 discovery of a heavy scalar particle by the ATLAS [12] and CMS [13] experiments at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) . That particle, now commonly called the Higgs boson 1 , has since then been the subject of a broad range of experimental studies which have so far confirmed all SM predictions for its intrinsic properties (see e.g. [14] and references therein).",

            "text": "Despite its huge successes in explaining the phenomenology of subnuclear physics from low-energy interactions all the way to the TeV scale, the SM is today considered at most an effective theory, one which should eventually break down when higher-energy reactions are studied, to become a lowenergy approximation of a larger and more comprehensive theory [15]. There are multiple reasons for this belief. First of all, the SM manifestly fails to include a description of gravity. Secondly, it does not yield a description of the properties of non-massless neutrinos, in particular an explanation of the smallness of their masses. Yet the most compelling argument demanding some more fundamental theory to replace the SM is the fact that the size of quantum corrections to the Higgs boson mass arising from the contribution of virtual loops involving SM particles exceed the observed value by many orders of magnitude in the absence of new physics below the Planck scale: the physical mass of the Higgs boson, which results from the addition and subtraction of those large contributions, appears exceptionally finetuned, ending up to be unnaturally light and close to the electroweak scale [16,17,18]. To the above list of clear shortcomings one could add the absence in the SM of other desirable features of a final theory -an explanation, e.g., of the hierarchy of fermion masses, of the weakness of gravity with respect to the other forces, of the observed abundance of dark matter, and of the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe; or the lack of a common unification scale of running couplings at high energy.",

Notable examples of the former kind are supersymmetry (SUSY) models [19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28] which radically solve the fine-tuning of the Higgs mass by introducing an automatic cancellation of its quantum corrections through a symmetry of bosons and fermions; and large extra dimension theories [29,30,31] which directly explain the weakness of gravity by allowing for its dispersion outside of the (3+1)dimensional subspace where the SM lives. Examples of the latter include technicolour [32] and other ideas like theories with a composite Higgs [33,34,35,36,37,38,39], and grand-unification theories based on larger gauge groups that include the SM one [40,49,41,42].",

In many cases the mass scale at which these particles should make their presence felt cannot much exceed the one accessible by the LHC experiments, lest the involved models become less compelling as an explanation of the observed shortcomings of the SM at the electroweak scale. This is the case, e.g., of new U (1) groups occurring in models of dynamical symmetry breaking, Little Higgs (LH) models, or the above mentioned models with large extra dimensions at scales of the order of O(1/ TeV). This has led the LHC experiments to carry out an extensive campaign of searches for localized excesses of observed event rates over SM predictions in all the accessible final states of heavy resonance decays. Among those searches, the ones focusing on pairs of gauge bosons have recently polarized the attention of experimentalists, thanks to two independent encouragements of different origin: first and foremost, the successful observation of three different diboson final states (W W , ZZ, \u03b3\u03b3) of the SM Higgs scalar, which gave additional motivation to the development of new experimental techniques to improve signal detection and to tame the relevant backgrounds; and second, the recent breakthroughs in the identification of highly-boosted hadronic decays of W , Z, and Higgs bosons within individual \"fat jets\". Furthermore, the inclusion of the Higgs as a confirmed elementary boson has brought new entries in the list of final states considered in the class of diboson searches: ones including a vector boson and a Higgs boson, and the one consisting in Higgs boson pairs. These have widened the experimental reach in the parameter space of some of the new physics models, especially ones extending the Higgs sector. The null results obtained by all LHC searches performed so far have been turned into severe bounds on the phase space allowed to models predicting the existence of resonances with calculated cross sections above the observed limits, which in some cases extend down into the sub-femtobarn range.",

The bosons we consider are elementary, and we somewhat limit the range of the related theoretical models by only focusing on SM bosons: the four electroweak vectors, the 125 GeV Higgs scalar, and the gluon. We however make an exception or two by including in our review the search for H \u2192 aa decays and H \u2192 ZA decays arising in extended Higgs sector theories, because of their connection to related signatures of interest here. The specified criterion excludes as a studied resonance signal the 125 GeV scalar discovered in 2012, as we consider it to genuinely belong to the SM. Although it may feel strange to not include in this report the one and only resonant signal we have so far been able to discover in diboson final states, a careful treatment of that topic would require too much space; there are a number of excellent reviews that cover the topic in detail (see e.g. [43,44]), to which we refer the interested reader. However, we do discuss results of ATLAS and CMS searches for Higgs-like resonances in their mass spectra of W W , ZZ, and \u03b3\u03b3 pairs, as those searches are sensitive to additional Higgs bosons arising in Two-Higgs-Doublet Models (2HDM) and other SM extensions: besides the intrinsic interest of their target, they have directed a large experimental effort into the optimization of the necessary techniques, as discussed in detail in Sec. 5. Those techniques have found application in a host of other studies.",

Rather, the emphasis of this review will be on the techniques more than on the actual search results, especially given that the latter are only constituted by exclusion limits, and there are no exciting hints of possible new discoveries awaiting to be confirmed.

Following a two-year shutdown to allow for important upgrades to the accelerating complex and to the detectors, Run 2 started in 2015 and is currently still ongoing. The center-of-mass energy of proton-proton collisions has been increased to 13 TeV, providing large increases in the experimental sensitivity to massive new particles. While a full picture of the reach for new resonances from the full Run 2 statistics will only be drawn from the year 2019 onwards, when a new long shutdown of the LHC is planned, a few experimental results based on up to 40 inverse femtobarns of integrated luminosity collected until recently at 13 TeV are already available in refereed journals at the time of writing this review.

Section 5 offers an overview of the experimental techniques and the statistical methods employed in the extraction of results. After a brief summary of diboson resonance searches performed at past accelerator facilities, Section 6 presents the LHC results, divided in subsections that deal with four non-overlapping categories of final state signatures: ones involving only W and Z bosons, ones including at least one photon, ones including at least one Higgs boson, and ones involving gluon pairs. Section 7 finally offers a discussion of the general picture resulting from the described studies, as well as a brief overview of the future prospects of diboson searches.

An attractive alternative to this modus operandi is to consider simplified models which make generic predictions on specific observable processes.

A number of different benchmarks have been examined in detail, and the resulting literature is quite extended. One model considered in a number of LHC searches, in particular by the ATLAS collaboration, is the \"extended gauge model\" (EGM) [52], where the coupling of a heavy W boson to SM W and Z bosons is equal to the W W Z coupling strength in the SM. This can be generalized by scaling the new particle coupling by a factor c EGM \u00d7 (m W /m W ) 2 , which has the consequence that the W will exhibit a partial width scaling linearly with m W , in contrast with the SSM where the width has a steep m 5 W dependence. For both SSM and EGM, the produced W and Z bosons emitted in the W decay are expected to be longitudinally polarized. Direct experimental searches at the Tevatron, LEP, and LEP-II, as well as the more recent LHC ones which are the real focus of this review, have specifically targeted some of those scenarios, placing limits to the allowed regions of their parameter space. Indirect constraints on the models arise instead essentially from the implication on mass and couplings of the extra resonance of LEP precision measurements at the Z pole and LEP-II off-pole measurements [53].",

Perhaps the most important feature of the new resonance, besides its mass and width, is the helicity of its couplings to SM fermions, as this is either purely left-or right-handed in most scenarios, with small mixing effects [55]. The classical examples are the left-right symmetric model first discussed in [56,57], and the alternate left-right model [58], where the new W boson only couples to SM fermion-new fermion pairs. In general, W bosons are a common product of a wide class of new physics models, including the Randall-Sundrum (RS) model with bulk gauge fields [59,60,61,62,63,64,65,66,67,68], theories with universal extra dimensions [69,70], and LH models [71,72]. A useful simplified model for the interpretation of experimental searches for heavy new gauge bosons W and Z , which summarizes many different versions of similar constructions, is the Heavy Vector Triplet (HVT) model proposed in [73]. The HVT model can be described with a small number of parameters which determine the main observable features of heavy vector boson production. The g V parameter governs the strength of the new vector boson interaction; the coupling of the new bosons to SM fermions is determined by the coefficient c F , and their coupling to the Higgs boson and to longitudinally-polarized W and Z bosons is determined by the coefficient c H . The phenomenology ends up being almost completely described in terms of the combination g 2 c F /g V and g V c H (where g is the SU(2) coupling), along with the mass scale M V of the practically degenerate heavy vector triplet.",

In model A the coupling strength g V is set to 1.0, and the branching fractions of the new resonances to SM fermions and bosons are comparable. The model describes heavy vectors emerging from an underlying weakly-coupled extensions of the SM gauge group [74], such as in the sequential standard model [52]. A second model (\"model B\") describes the triplet resulting from a non-linearly-realized SO(5)/SO(4) global symmetry, where g V is set to 3.0. In this case the new bosons have dominant branching fractions into SM bosons; however, they are still produced mainly by the Drell-Yan mechanism, as the vector-boson fusion (VBF) production process remains sub-dominant for reasonable values of the parameters. Also, large values of g V lead to broad resonances, with a widthto-mass ratio exceeding 0.1, which cannot be easily constrained by experimental searches for localized bumps in mass distributions. Model B corresponds to a strongly-coupled composite Higgs scenario [36]. The ATLAS and CMS collaborations have started to use the HVT model benchmarks, especially model B, in reporting their search results for resonances sought in W W and W Z final states relevant to this review. Those results are reported in Sec. 6.2.",

That idea was resuscitated 20 years ago to provide a possible explanation of the so-called hierarchy problem of the SM. The hierarchy of scales -the large disparity between the electroweak scale, O(TeV), and the Planck scale, M P l \u223c O(10 16 TeV)-is the origin of the unnatural fine-tuning of the Higgs boson mass, and is arguably the most compelling argument calling for a SM extension. The model put forth in 1999 by Randall and Sundrum [29] attempts to generate a large difference between the electroweak and the Planck scale by introducing a fifth space-time dimension between two subspaces (\"branes\", a shorthand for membranes), separated by a 5-dimensional \"bulk\". SM particles are confined in the TeV brane, but gravity is produced at the Planck scale and can extend into the bulk. This automatically explains the weakness of gravity in the TeV brane, as the wavefunction of its interaction carrier has a small overlap with the region where matter fields live. The Planck brane generates the scale of physical phenomena on the TeV brane by a warp factor",

In order to explore the phenomenology of the RS model, it is advantageous to consider two direct observables which are a function of the R c and k parameters: the mass of the lightest Kaluza-Klein (KK) excitation M 1 , and the dimensionless coupling parameterk = k/M P l . The fine-tuning of the Higgs mass is then eliminated if 0.01 <k < 0.1 and M 1 is at the TeV scale; larger values ofk would make the theory non-perturbative [78]. RS graviton states are predicted to have s-wave decays to photon pairs and p-wave decays to lepton pairs; the former have a favourable branching ratio [79]. They can also have a significant decay rate into gluon pairs [80], in which case they can be searched for in high-mass jet-pair (dijet) events. In a version generically called \"bulk RS graviton\" model, the constraints coming from the flavour structure of the SM are addressed by a localization of fermion fields in the warped extra dimension. In the bulk graviton model the decay G * bulk \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 and the one to light fermions are suppressed by a factor proportional to the volume of the extra dimension [81]. As a consequence of the reduced fermion coupling, production through gluon-fusion diagrams are favoured. This leads to a difference in the polarization of weak bosons produced in G * and G * bulk : a transverse polarization is favoured in the former case, a longitudinal polarization in the latter. Bulk graviton models have been increasingly considered in the searches using weak boson final states (W W , ZZ), once the decays to photon or lepton pairs ruled out their accessible parameter space.",

Indeed, the verification of all SM predictions for its properties has left little doubt on its identity. Irrespective of the above, the investigation of the Higgs sector is by no means finished business, as a whole class of models that extend the SM by including more complex scalar doublets predict more physical states, and allow one of them to be identical to the particle predicted by the minimal SM. So, e.g., this is the case in the so-called \"decoupling limit\" [86,87]. More in general, the existence of a richer spectrum of Higgs-like particles is an open experimental and theoretical issue. The obvious, and minimal, extension of the SM Higgs sector is constituted by so-called two-Higgs doublet models [88], that introduce a second complex doublet of scalars in the Lagrangian and predict the existence of five new scalars. Like the Higgs boson of the SM, these result from the eight degrees of freedom of the two doublets, after spontaneous symmetry breaking uses three of them to provide W and Z bosons with longitudinal-polarization degrees of freedom. The most general form of the 2HDM scalar potential is described by 14 parameters, however some simplifying assumptions are usually made to exclude CP non-conservation and spontaneous breaking effects, as well as the absence in the potential of odd quartic terms in the doublets. The potential then contains the following terms:",

The experimental investigation of 2DHM scenarios therefore benefits from the focusing on well-specified benchmarks. Within 2HDMs, one may generally distinguish a few specific situations, which address differently the problem of avoiding tree-level FCNC potentially arising from the non-flavour-diagonal nature of the Yukawa couplings. Glashow and Weinberg showed [89] how, to ensure the absence of FCNC, it is sufficient that all fermions of a given gauge representation acquire mass through couplings to only one Higgs doublet. This leads to four main possibilities for 2HDMs. In the first one, called \"Type-I 2HDM\", all fermions couple to only one Higgs doublet, while in the second, \"Type-II 2HDM\", up-and down-type quarks couple to different doublets. The precise definition of the other two types of models is not univocal in the literature, and they are not frequently used as benchmarks for LHC searches so we omit their definition here. The class of Type-II 2HDMs includes the well-known \"Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model\" (MSSM) [90,91,92,93,94,95], along with a number of variants that allow for additional freedom to escape tight direct and indirect experimental bounds. The MSSM is a valid setup which allows to define the general features of the Higgs sector in 2DHM models by using five main parameters: tan \u03b2, the Higgsino mass parameter \u00b5, the mass of the A boson M A , and the common masses of scalars and gauginos at the GUT scale, M 0 and M 1/2 . The Higgs sector in generic Type-II 2HDM is less constrained than in the MSSM, as the parameter \u03b1 in the former is not constrained by the value of tan \u03b2 and by the scalar and pseudoscalar masses as in the latter; in addition, the charged and pseudoscalar masses are not necessarily very similar in generic Type-II models, allowing for a richer spectrum of decays. A few searches consider the model called hMSSM [96,97], where the \"h\" stands for habemus; there, the light CP-even Higgs boson mass is fixed to 125 GeV throughout the space of model parameters. This is possible with a high SUSY-breaking scale, by making assumptions on the structure of the Higgs sector in terms of radiative corrections and couplings.",

If the two-body decay of stop quarks to flavour-preserving states is disallowed, the stop may be able to hadronize, creating an \u03b7-like state of quantum numbers J P C = 0 ++ and width in the tens of MeV range. Such a particle would decay primarily into a pair of SM fermions or bosons, or into a pair of neutralinos. Finally, also models that predict the existence of a hidden sector of particles mixing with the observed Higgs boson [108,109] must be cited as a possible source of resonant Higgs boson pairs. As far as production of an A boson is concerned, there are no couplings to vector boson pairs to consider. However, the possibility of decays A \u2192 Zh must be studied, if the mass of the A boson is below the top pair threshold of 350 GeV, above which the A \u2192 tt decay dominates. The Zh decay rate is proportional to cos 2 (\u03b1\u2212\u03b2).

The introduced interaction is invariant under a SU (N T ) T gauge group; for N T = 3 one has a new QCD-like interaction at a higher energy scale. Technicolour theories mimicking QCD have been strongly constrained by electroweak precision fits, in particular by the measurement of the S and T parameters [110]. Low-scale technicolour theories (LSTC) [111,112] offer an escape to electroweak as well as FCNC constraints by introducing a \"walking gauge coupling\" and calling for a large number of new fermion doublets. In this scheme the \u03c9 T , \u03c1 T , and a T masses are lower than twice the mass of the lowest-mass \u03c0 T , and thus only decay by electroweak interactions, mostly to photons and gauge bosons, with narrow widths. The \u03c1 T and a T are nearly degenerate [112]; the experimental signature of those two particles is therefore unable to distinguish them; they would appear together as a single bump in the W Z mass distribution in fully reconstructed final states, or as a broader feature in modes including neutrinos. However, the branching fraction to W Z pairs is smaller than 10% if the \u03c1 T mass is smaller than twice the \u03c0 T mass, when the decay \u03c1 T \u2192 \u03c0 T W is the most frequent [111,113].",

            "text": "The spontaneous breaking of electroweak symmetry has also been combined with TeV-scale strong dynamics by a number of theories that extend the SM. The new strong sector might result from a new interaction [16,32,18] or from composite Higgs bosons [114,115,116]. In all cases new heavy particles are called for, which usually decay to pairs of SM vector bosons. The specific class of models called Little Higgs [117,71,118,119] foresees that the Higgs boson arises as a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson in a spontaneously broken global symmetry; this idea was first brought forth by Georgi and Kaplan [120,121] in their \"composite Higgs\" model, and was later resurrected to solve its fine-tuning problems [72]. The name \"little Higgs\" is due to the fact that in these models the Higgs boson is much lighter than all other pseudo-Goldstone bosons in the theory. These theories imply the existence of new heavy bosons with the same quantum numbers of the electroweak ones of the SM, W \u00b1 H , Z H and A H , as well as a heavy charge +2/3 singlet (usually called a \"top partner\") and a scalar triplet [72,122]; these particles are the minimum extension of the SM that allows to cancel the leading quadratic divergence in the Higgs mass at one-loop level, eliminating the problem of fine tuning between widely different energy scales. A new discrete symmetry T is required [123,124] in order to bring the mass of the new particles below the TeV; SM particles and the heavy singlet are even under T, while the new bosons are T-odd. A sub-class called \"littlest Higgs\" models also include the existence of \"mirror fermions\", one for each SM fermion, which have negative T-parity [125]. For what concerns resonant diboson signatures of relevance to this review, mention must be made of the scalar triplet \u2206 \u2212\u2212 , \u2206 \u2212 , \u2206 0 of Georgi and Machacek [126,127]; the doubly charged scalar, which can be produced by vector boson fusion mechanisms at the LHC, is a smoking gun of this model, but its most promising signature involves decays to same-sign lepton pairs, while the branching fraction to W pairs is typically below 10% [128,129]. The Higgs triplet model [126] has been studied by ATLAS (see infra, Sec. 6.2.2). In that framework a parameter s 2 H governs the phenomenology through the definition of the fraction of the squared masses of gauge bosons generated by the new Higgs triplet, when 1 \u2212 s 2 H is the fraction attributed to the SM Higgs doublet. The cross section and width of the new Higgs particles result proportional to the value of s H .",

The possibility of resonant decays to gluon pairs arises in models predicting string resonances [130,131,132,133]. Fundamental strings may have a mass at the TeV scale in models with large extra dimensions; this may allow the production of Regge excitations of quarks and gluons. One assumes that the theory is weakly coupled, such that reliance can be made on perturbation theory to compute scattering amplitudes; this also implies that the energy scale of strong gravity effects is higher, leaving the lowest Regge excitations unaffected by their complex phenomenology. The cross section and natural width of the Regge excitations are independent on the details of the compactification; the cross section may however depend on the colour factors and spin of the excited states [134,130].",

To perform those tasks, the accelerator is endowed with four main experiments built inside underground caverns where beams are brought to intersect: the all-purpose ATLAS and CMS detectors, plus a B-physics-oriented detector studying highly-asymmetric collisions, LHCb, and a detector optimized for the study of heavy ion collisions, ALICE. Originally targeting in particular the discovery of the Higgs boson, a goal achieved in 2012, the LHC is now expected to bring in a deeper knowledge of the SM, in particular in the electroweak and Higgs sector. Yet it is hoped to also enable the discovery of new physics beyond the SM, in the form of new high-mass particles and interactions. The bending of the beams in the synchrotron ring is produced by 1232 14-m-long superconducting magnets, cooled by superfluid helium at the temperature of 1.9K to provide in their interior a dipole field of up to 8.3 Tesla. Dipoles contain the two beams in a single magnetic structure. A lattice of additional superconducting magnets producing quadrupole and higher-order fields provides strong focusing and squeezing of the transverse dimensions of the beams in coincidence with the interaction regions. The LHC receives proton beams from the SpS accelerator at 450 GeV and accelerates them in 28 minutes to the final collision energy (up to 4 TeV during Run 1, and up to 6.5 during the ongoing Run 2) with two independent sets of radiofrequency cavities operating at 400 MHz. Protons in the beams are bunched into up to 2808 equally-spaced packets, providing a nominal interaction rate of 40 MHz in the core of the ATLAS and CMS detectors. At the design instantaneous luminosity of 10 34 cm \u22122 s \u22121 each bunch crossing results on average in about 25 inelastic proton-proton collisions.While most of these are low-energy interactions that do not yield interesting physics processes, they make the reconstruction of physics objects produced in the hard interactions of interest considerably more difficult. In addition, particles such as neutrons produced in a bunch crossing may also contribute to detector signals in subsequent ones. These effects are collectively addressed as \"pile-up\". A careful accounting of pile-up contributions to the measurements performed by the detectors is required in order to retain the detectors performance in terms of resolution and calibration.",

Due to the complex tuning procedures of the accelerator complex, the integrated luminosity acquired during 2010 only amounted to 45pb \u22121 in ATLAS and 43pb \u22121 in CMS; the corresponding datasets were mainly used for a few pilot measurements and calibrations. In 2011 the larger number of bunches and bunch densities allowed the accelerator to deliver over 6f b \u22121 of integrated luminosity to the experiments; a total of 5.1f b \u22121 were acquired by ATLAS and 5.5f b \u22121 by CMS; of these, respectively 4.7f b \u22121 and 5.1f b \u22121 were declared good for physics analysis. Those 7-TeV datasets allowed to produce, among a host of other physics measurements, a number of searches for resonances in diboson final states.

Muon stations embedded in the steel flux-return yoke outside the solenoid are equipped with gas detectors using three technologies: drift tubes, cathode strip chambers, and resistive-plate chambers. They provide coverage in the region |\u03b7| < 2.4. For muons whose trajectory is measured both in the inner tracker and in the muon stations, the transverse momentum resolution ranges between 1% and 5% for transverse momenta up to 1 TeV [147].",

An extension of the triggering capabilities of CMS comes from the recently developed technique called data scouting [148]. This consists in the storing of a limited amount of information from each event in a dedicated stream. To be meaningful, the information must include an online treatment of the calibration and cleanup procedures usually applied in offline analysis.

A fourth measuring station was added to each muon endcap, complemented by the installation of 125-ton composite shielding at each end of the detector. A pixel luminosity telescope was installed at each side of the central detector around the beam pipe. A further upgrade was carried out after the end of 2016 data taking to install a fourth layer of silicon pixel sensors in close proximity to the beam.

The reconstruction flow allows for a considerable interplay between the various steps -e.g., a primary event vertex must be located before the measurement of neutral energy deposits can be turned into precise four-momentum estimates, as well as prior to any attempt at identifying secondary decay vertices from long-lived hadrons. A separate discussion of the identification and measurement of each of the \"high-level objects\" through which different final states can be categorized is nonetheless the easiest way to describe the procedures. Once individual particles such as electrons, muons, and \u03c4 lepton candidates, photons and isolated hadrons, as well as collective phenomena like hadronic jets, b-tags, and missing transverse energy are measured, their four-momenta must be corrected to account for known biases of various nature. These range from effects dependent of running conditions (e.g. the instantaneous luminosity at the moment when the event was collected) to shifts related to measurement procedures, detector non-linearities, or specific properties of the measured objects. Dedicated working groups within the experiments monitor the functioning of the sub-detector elements, and continuously update calibration constants and procedures in order to optimize the resolution of energy and momentum measurements throughout data taking.

A set of criteria based on the observed characteristics of the cluster and the track are devised to reduce the background from jets with a leading track and high electromagnetic component. Analyses targeting the decay of W and Z bosons usually also require the electron candidates to have transverse energy E T above 25 or 30 GeV; the associated track is required to be consistent with the identified primary vertex using impact parameter significance criteria in the transverse plane as well as the spatial difference between the track extrapolation and the primary vertex along the beam axis. The isolation of electrons from other objects is usually imposed by requiring that the sum of calorimeter energy not attributed to the electron shower within a cone of radius R = 0.3 in (\u03b7, \u03c6) space be smaller than some threshold (typically 4 to 6 GeV) [151]. Photon candidates are reconstructed from fixed-size clusters of cells in the electromagnetic (EM) calorimeter, using the cluster shape as a selection criterion [152]. Photons of relevance in searches for decays of massive resonances are usually required to be located inside the precision region of the EM calorimeter (|\u03b7| < 1.37 or 1.52 < |\u03b7| < 2.37, excluding the transition region between barrel and endcap calorimeters) [153]. To increase the purity of photon candidates, ATLAS searches require isolation criteria based on both calorimeter and tracking information. Contributions from pile-up and underlying event to the calorimeter isolation are subtracted on an event-by-event basis [154,155,156]. Energy scale corrections are applied to the measured electron energy in order that data and Monte Carlo (MC) match in the reconstructed peak of well-identified Z \u2192 ee events [157]. A multivariate regression algorithm [158] was also developed to improve the calibration of the estimate of electron and photon energy, based on Run 1 data. The uncertainty in the energy scale of energetic photons varies in the range 0.5-2% as a function of pseudorapidity. CMS also starts the identification procedure of electron and photon candidates from clusters in the electromagnetic calorimeter [159]. First, groups of clusters are used to form superclusters. In the barrel region these are formed from five-cristal strips in pseudorapidity, centered around the seed crystal. The extension in azimuth accounts for the effects of the magnetic field on electrons resulting from photons starting their shower before the ECAL. In the endcap calorimeters the clusters are formed from 5x5 matrices of crystals. Electron candidates are reconstructed from superclusters with a matched track. The transverse momentum of the electron is estimated from a fit to the track trajectory that employs a Gaussian-sum filter algorithm [160]. The algorithm accounts for the multiple bremsstrahlung of soft photons by the electron crossing the layers of silicon sensors in the tracker. Electron selections differ based on the specific needs of the different analyses; use is commonly made of the profile of the energy deposit in the calorimeter, as well as the fraction of energy deposited in the hadronic calorimeter behind the electron cluster. To increase the purity of the selected candidates, the number of missed hits in the pixel tracker and other track quality criteria are also used. Electrons from vector boson decays are required to be isolated from other energy deposits or track activity. The variable I rel is computed as the sum of transverse momenta of Particle Flow (PF) [161, 162, 163, 164] candidates (both charged and neutral) within a radius of 0.3 around the electron direction, divided by the electron p T and corrected on an event-by-event basis for pile-up effects [165]. For photons a variable called R 9 , computed as the fraction of cluster energy contained in the innermost 3x3 matrix of crystals, is sensitive to the degradation of the E T resolution caused by the effects of the magnetic field when the showers are initiated in the tracker. To compute their four-momenta with precision, photon candidates are associated to the primary vertex having the largest sum of p 2",

A fine-tuning of the calibration developed for h \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 searches, where photon energy measurements are crucial, is then operated by reconstructing as photons the electron showers from Z \u2192 ee decays, when no tracking information is used except for the vertex position in the measurement of the mass of the electron pairs. The comparison of the mass distribution observed in real data to that obtained in simulated events allows to account for slight underestimations of the energy resolution. The uncertainty in the energy scale of photons after the above calibrations amounts to 0.25% for photons of E T > 20 GeV.",

            "text": "ATLAS reconstructs muons within the |\u03b7| < 2.7 acceptance of its muon system. Muon candidates are obtained from one of three main reconstruction methods [170,171]: a combined fit, segment tagging, or calorimeter tagging. The combined muon reconstruction starts with independent tracks fits in the inner detector and in the muon stations. A combination is performed by an outside-in fit that starts with the track in the muon stations and extrapolates it inward to the inner detector track matching it. During the procedure, hits in the muon stations can be added or removed to improve the fit quality. When a muon station candidate is absent (either because the muon has insufficient momentum to cross more than one muon layer, or because it crosses regions of the muon stations with reduced acceptance) segment-tagged muons can still be constructed by tracks in the inner detector that extrapolate to at least one local track segment in the drift tubes or cathode strip chambers. To further extend acceptance, calorimeter-tagged muons can be reconstructed from inner tracks that match to a calorimetric deposit compatible with the passage of a minimum ionizing particle. Muon candidates employed in most physics analyses must then pass several quality requirements, including e.g. the number of missed hits in the inner tracker and the value of the fit \u03c7 2 , to suppress backgrounds from pion and kaon decays and to ensure a good momentum measurement; depending on their quality, they are classified as loose, medium, or tight muons. The misidentification probability is monitored using a unbiased sample of K 0 decays to charged pion pairs in real data collected with calorimeter-based triggers, while the identification efficiency is measured with the tag-and-probe method [171] in Z \u2192 \u00b5\u00b5 and J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u00b5\u00b5 decays. To select muons coming from the decay of W and Z bosons, isolation criteria are added to the list of requirements. ATLAS analyses use a track-based isolation variable obtained by constructing the sum of transverse momenta of tracks with p T > 1 GeV collected within a cone of muon-p T -dependent radius, or a calorimeter-based isolation constructed with the energy of topological clusters [172] in a cone of radius R = 0.2 around the muon candidate, after subtracting the expected muon and pile-up contributions. The momentum scale of muons is corrected with a parametrization determined by a likelihood fit to Z and J/\u03c8 dimuon candidates; after the calibration residual scale uncertainties are estimated to range between 0.05% and 0.1% for Z-decay muons. The relative momentum resolution ranges between 1.7% and 2.9%, mostly depending on muon pseudorapidity. In CMS, most high-p T analyses consider muon candidates reconstructed in the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 2.4 by a combined fit performed outside-in with the Kalman filter technique [173]. The fit considers both tracker and muon detector hits; the latter improve the momentum resolution of muons with p T > 200 GeV [174,175]. These \"global muons\" must have at least one hit in the pixel tracker, six in the strip layers, and two segments reconstructed in the muon detector planes. In addition, global muon candidates must fulfill other selection criteria, including impact parameter and momentum measurement requirements [176]. \"Tracker muons\", that only require a track matched to a single segment in the muon system, extend the acceptance to momenta below 5 GeV. To be considered in offline analysis, muons must typically fulfill several additional requirements based on the quality of the track fit and the matching of muon chambers segments to the trajectory measured in the silicon tracker, as well as on the impact parameter of the track. For muons coming from the decay of heavy objects, isolation requirements are also applied. The typical requirement is that the sum of p T of all tracks in a cone of R = 0.3 around the muon candidate does not exceed 10% of the muon p T . The identification efficiency is measured like in ATLAS using the tag-and-probe technique [177] on clean samples of Z \u2192 \u00b5\u00b5 and J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u00b5\u00b5 decays. The fake rate corresponding to the chosen muon selection criteria is measured for pions, kaons, and protons using large samples of K 0 \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0, \u039b \u2192 \u03c0p, and \u03c6 \u2192 KK decays. For tight identification criteria fake rates are usually below 0.1% [176]. Muon scale calibration parameters are extracted with a likelihood technique that models the biases as a function of individual muon kinematic characteristics, using as a reference the Z \u2192 \u00b5\u00b5 and J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u00b5\u00b5 mass distributions. The momentum scale after calibration is known to better than 0.2% accuracy. The relative momentum resolution of calibrated muons, integrated in \u03c6 and \u03b7, ranges from 1.8% to 2.3% for Z-decay muons.",

Tracks are associated to the calorimetric deposits if they pass quality criteria based on impact parameter and number of hits, and have p T > 1 GeV. The reconstruction of the individual charged and neutral hadrons in \u03c4 decays helps in the calculation of the visible energy from \u03c4 decay and in the classification of the decay mode. The higher resolution of the inner tracker improves the energy measurement with respect to estimates exclusively based on calorimeter deposits. A final \u03c4 -specific calibration, obtained from MC, corrects for effects such as energy lost out of the narrow cone, the underlying event, and pileup contributions. A boosted decision tree is trained to discriminate \u03c4 candidates from hadronic jets using the calorimeter cluster shape and the track multiplicity. A veto is also applied to a likelihood value designed to flag electron candidates.

Four-momenta are obtained from the energy of clusters, assuming they are massless. For jets with a transverse momentum below 50 GeV a requirement is applied on the output of a multi-variate discriminant [182] to reject jets largely contributed by pileup, based on tracking and vertex information. Jets withstand corrections that address the pile-up contributions and the calorimetric response [183,184,155]. The calibration of the energy response depends on jet p T and \u03b7 and is performed with factors extracted from MC simulation and with the combination of a number of in situ techniques [185], which exploit the p T balance between a jet and a reference object (photon, Z boson, jets system) recoiling against it. A further calibration designed to reduce flavour-dependent response is also derived [186]. An uncertainty in the jet energy scale of less than 1% was estimated for |\u03b7| < 1.2 and jets of 55 < p T < 500 GeV in Run 1 [187]; the value was confirmed for jets of 100 < p T < 500 GeV using Run 2 data [188]. In the study on Run 1 (Run 2) data the uncertainty was estimated in the central region to be of 3% (4.5%) at low-p T , where pile-up corrections have a larger impact. For jets in the region |\u03b7| > 0.8, dijet balancing techniques allowed to estimate a jet energy scale uncertainty below 2% for p T > 80 GeV.",

The four-momenta of all identified PF candidates are clustered by the anti-k T algorithm [189,190] or the Cambridge-Aachen (CA) recombination algorithm [191,192] as implemented in the FastJet package [193]. The k T algorithm [194,195] is used to recluster wide jets in the calculation of the variable called \"Nsubjettiness\" used to identify boosted objects (see infra, Sec. 4.5). Charged hadrons that do not originate from the event vertex produced by the hard subprocess of interest are subtracted from the list of clustered particles; a further mitigation of pile-up effects is operated by an average neutral-energy density subtraction [155]. Jet energies are corrected as a function of transverse momentum and pseudorapidity using MC simulations and data in dijet, multijet, \u03b3+ jet, and leptonic Z+jet events [196,197]; noiseoriginated jets, as well as ones not originated from the studied hard interaction, are eliminated by specific jet identification criteria [198]. For jets of 100 GeV (1 TeV) the energy resolution is of about 10% (5%) [199]. The jet energy scale of CMS jets after all calibrations is known with an accuracy of less than 3% overall, and better than 1% for jets of p T > 30 GeV in the barrel region |\u03b7| < 1.3 [199].",

If the decaying particle is highly boosted, however, the final state quarks are emitted with small spatial separation, and the streams of hadrons resulting from quark fragmentation partly overlap in (\u03b7, \u03c6) space. In such conditions it proves advantageous to first reconstruct the event with a clustering algorithm using a large radius parameter, and successively examine the substructure of the resulting jets in detail. The field of \"boosted objects tagging\" (or \"V-tagging\" when W and Z bosons are the explicit target) has boomed in the last decade, with the development of a number of techniques that allow the identification of vector bosons and top quarks within high-p T wide jets, allowing to overcome the otherwise enormous QCD backgrounds in the identification of hadronic decays of heavy objects.",

A local cluster-weighting algorithm [200] is used to calibrate the energy of their constituents and a reclustering is then performed by the k T algorithm with a R = 0.2 parameter; such sub-jets are removed from the list if they contain less than 5% of the large-R jet. The four-momentum of the large-R jet is then recomputed using the resulting sub-jets momenta. Finally, jet energy and mass can be calibrated to match the particle-level originating jet using MC simulation information [201,202]. Another approach combines topological clusters reconstructed in the calorimeter and undergoing a local calibration [203,204] into jets, using the CA algorithm with a R = 1.2 parameter. The iterative combination allows to identify the two last sub-jets as possible candidates of decay of bosons (W , Z, h). A cleanup [205,206] can then be applied to reduce noise and pile-up contributions, and avoid the consequent degradation in resolution.",

A number of techniques exist for this task. A jet pruning algorithm [208,209] used by many analyses reclusters jets with the CA algorithm, iteratively discarding their soft components during the recombination procedure, identified by angular and transverse momentum requirements. Finally the pruned mass of the jet, as computed from the fourmomenta of the components that have survived the pruning phase, is used to identify decay candidates of heavy objects. The technique significantly reduces the jet mass in single-quark-and gluon-originated jets [210]. Recently further advanced techniques for handling pile-up subtraction have been devised by the experiment. The algorithm called PUPPI [211] (from \"Pile-Up Per Particle Identification\") combines tracking information with the event pile-up properties into a four-momentum-rescaling weight assigned to charged and neutral candidates. The weight accounts for the likelihood that the particles originate from pile-up. Another algorithm, called \"soft-drop\" [212,213] can be used with jets whose momenta have been recomputed with PUPPI, to remove contributions from soft radiation. Corrections are finally applied to remove jet p T dependences in the measured jet mass [214]. The resolution in the jet mass after these corrections is typically of 10%.",

            "text": "The identification of heavy quarks as originators of hadronic jets is a very important tool in the search for new physics. b-quark-originated jets arise in over 99% of top quark decays, and are also the most frequent final state of Higgs boson decays, as the h \u2192 bb branching fraction is about 58% [218]; in addition, b-tagging can increase the purity of hadronic decays of the Z boson, because of the relative rarity of b-quark production in QCD backgrounds. Theoretical prejudices pointing at the top quark as a possible door to physics beyond the SM, together with the importance of Higgs and weak bosons as possible final states of new higher-mass states, make b-quark jets a crucial signature at the LHC. For those reasons, the ATLAS and CMS collaborations devoted extreme care in the construction of high-resolution tracking detectors capable of measuring the impact parameter of charged particle tracks with resolutions of the order of 10\u00b5m, with the main goal of enabling a high-efficiency identification of b-quark-originated jets. This exploits the O(ps) lifetime of B hadrons, which results in secondary decay vertices originating particles whose back-propagated tracks do not intersect the primary vertex position. The upgrades operated to the pixel detectors of the two experiments mentioned in Sec. 3, as well as the future ones designed for the high-luminosity phase of the LHC, had indeed the goal of improving, or at least securing, the performance of the experiments' near-vertex tracking capabilities in the increasingly complex environment of LHC collisions. The large amount of information that needs to be considered in the identification of b-quark jets makes the task a quite complex one. The strongest indicium of a heavy flavour decay is the presence of a secondary vertex reconstructed from charged tracks in the jet, displaced from the primary vertex and not compatible with being the result of two-body decays of neutral hadrons such as K s or \u039b, or photon conversions. Useful information is also contained in the composition of the jet and its fragmentation properties, as well as the presence of electron or muon candidates of small transverse momentum (\"soft leptons\"). Over the course of the past few years the experiments have therefore devised increasingly refined multi-variate techniques to produce effective b-tagging algorithms, improving their efficiency for a given fake rate along the way.",

Of relevance to this review are the most performant ones, which have been applied to searches involving heavy bosons decays to b-quark pairs. The first one, called CSV (for \"Combined Secondary Vertex\"), combines the information of identified secondary vertices in the jets with other individual and collective properties of tracks with large impact parameter, such that even when no secondary vertex can be directly fit, the information can still be effectively used to discriminate heavy-quark jets from ones originated from light-quark or gluons. The combination is performed using a likelihood ratio in an earlier version, and with an artificial neural network in the version used more recently. A second algorithm, called CMVA (for \"Combined Multi-Variate Algorithm\") [223,224], further combines two different versions of the CSV discriminant output with information coming from jet-probability tagging (which uses the probability of tracks being originated from the primary vertex) and from two algorithms searching for soft electrons and muons inside jets. The combination is performed with a boosted decision tree based on the scikit-learn package [225].",

MC simulations of b-enriched final states such as top-pair decays are used along with real top-enriched and multi-jet events in data. Correction factors depending on jet p T are applied to scale the MC-measured efficiencies to what is observed in real data [226]. The experiments set the working point of their algorithms by specifying reference values of the rate of b-tagging light-quark and gluon jets. In CMS the \"loose\" operating point corresponds to a 10% rate of spurious tags, and is employed in searches where signal efficiency is more important than background rejection; a \"medium\" working point is defined by a 1% rate on light-quark and gluon jets; and a \"tight\" working point corresponds to 0.1% rate of spurious tags. To those values correspond typical b-tagging efficiencies of \u223c 85%, \u223c 70% and \u223c 50%, respectively; these numbers are weakly dependent on p T over a wide range of jet momenta, and typically decrease for very large-p T jets. In ATLAS the working points of the MV2 algorithm in Run 2 correspond to efficiencies of 85%, 77%, 70% and 60% for light-jet mistagging rates of 3%, 0.8%, 0.3%, and 0.08% respectively.

The measurement of their longitudinal momentum is prevented at the LHC because of the unknown boost of the reaction center-of-mass in the laboratory frame and of the incomplete hermeticity of the detectors close to the beam axis, but their transverse momentum can be inferred by momentum conservation. This allows the reconstruction of transverse W boson mass in W \u2192 l\u03bd decays, as well as the detection of a signal of Z \u2192 \u03bd\u03bd decays in many topologies. The missing transverse momentum in ATLAS is calculated from all reconstructed jets and leptons as the negative of their vectorial sum in the transverse plane [229,230]. Calorimeter objects in the calculation are calibrated to the electromagnetic energy scale. Muons in the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 2.7 are considered separately and corrected for by accounting for the energy deposit they left in the calorimeter, when they are isolated. For non-isolated muons the momentum determined in the muon spectrometer, after the calorimeter energy loss, is added to the calculated missing transverse energy vector. Corrections are also applied to account for soft tracks associated to the primary event vertex. After all calibrations, the resolution in the missing transverse energy is well parametrized by the form \u03c3 = k E T with k = 0.4 \u2212 0.5 GeV \u22120.5 , where E T is the sum of transverse energies of detected objects in the event.",

A less used definition, called \"calo-MET\" [232], considers all calorimetric deposits and a correction for identified muon candidates. The resolution of missing transverse energy is improved by correcting all identified jets to match the energy of particle-level jets. Pile-up contributions add little unbalancing to the transverse energy flow as they very seldom produce energetic neutrinos; however the fluctuation of neutral components originated from pile-up, combined with calorimeter non-linearities in the response to neutral and charged hadrons, requires a correction that is operated using the vectorial sum of all particles associated to pile-up vertices. Residual azimuthal dependences of the missing transverse energy due to imperfect detector alignment, \u03c6-dependent calibrations, and other small effects is also corrected for. A more recent calculation of the missing transverse energy in CMS, developed to address high-luminosity running conditions [231], employs a multivariate algorithm to reconstruct the missing transverse energy vector. The algorithm performs a regression with boosted decision trees trained with simulated Z \u2192 \u00b5\u00b5 decays and \u03b3 + jet events, to improve the measurement of the missing E T in high-pile-up conditions. The regression targets the hadronic recoil computed from PF inputs in two successive regression steps.

In many situations a good model of some of the background processes is offered by control samples of experimental data, or by other data-driven techniques that e.g. precisely estimate the misidentification rates of the employed algorithms. These techniques are the preferred option for the study of instrumental backgrounds arising when one or more of the final state particle signals are spurious: the detailed modeling by computer simulations of the reconstructed properties of the physics objects can be challenging, hence reliance on parametrizations of the fake rate in real data is warranted in these cases. An example is the signature of an energetic photon, which can be faked by a neutral pion or by an hadronic jet; a study of the fake rate as a function of the observed properties of the identified photon cluster can be performed in independent datasets and provide a satisfactory model of the effect. Another example is the signature of a b-tag in a jet, which is subjected to a contamination from light quarks and gluons; experimental techniques that assess the number of b-tags due to those contaminations in a given collected dataset usually rely on parametrizations of the fake rate as a function of the jet properties.",

In many of the searches for narrow resonances described in this review, however, the modeling of backgrounds with either MC simulations or datadriven techniques would not be precise enough, due to systematic uncertainties of various nature. In those cases reliance is made on the empirical parametrization of the studied distributions with smooth functions of several parameters. A rigorous a priori definition of the classes of functions used for the parametrization, as well as a prescription for the recipe selecting the proper number of parameters of the function, is then essential to constrain experimental biases.",

The implementation of the most advanced methods has however lagged behind in particle physics, despite the extremely good match that high-energy physics (HEP) problems offer to the classical use cases of those methods. So, for instance, while already in 1992 neural networks (NN) were tested in tough classification problems such as quarkgluon discrimination at the Tevatron [261], the diffusion of NN for particle searches and measurements is only becoming significant now. The reason for the slowness of large particle physics experiments in adopting MVA techniques was the general preference of sound, well-tested and old-fashioned analysis methods which, while suboptimal, were not perceived as dangerous as MVAs, which could instead be thought to potentially introduce \"unknown unknowns\" in the extraction of the wanted results. Of particular concern of this conservative groupthink was the fact that the algorithms lend themselves to be used as black boxes, with little or no human intervention; the decision boundaries of MVA algorithms used in classification problems are typically quite hard, if not close to impossible, to fully decrypt and make sense of. The fact that decision trees (see infra) are on the easier side and neural networks on the harder side along this metric is a reason why the latter have been the latest to be adopted and trusted in HEP applications.",

In the first case the goal is to construct a function of the data features that takes on different, discrete values for recognizable different classes. In the second case, the output of the function must instead predict a continuous variable. Broadly speaking, in searches for new physics processes the crucial issue is the classification of events based on their observed features and kinematics, as any final state can be contributed by a number of different background sources in addition to the searched signal. There exist a number of classification tools that allow for the separation of data in disjunct classes based on their features: the most widely known are nearest neighbours, support vector machines, decision trees, random forests, and neural networks. These methods belong to the category of statistical learning methods called \"supervised learning\" ones, as before being applied to classify the data under study they rely on a training stage where they learn to distinguish the features of the various event classes. In HEP analysis boosted decision trees (BDT) were the first MVA algorithm to know a rapid diffusion, starting a few years after the turn of the century. While a decision tree is a simple structure where a succession of one-dimensional boundaries on each available feature are defined to best separate two classes of events, BDTs are large collections of such structures randomly created from training data, used collectively to improve the classification accuracy through \"boosting\" techniques designed to optimize a differentiable loss function. The most used implementation of BDTs in HEP was for a long time the one available in the TMVA package [168], but recently LHC experiments have started to publish results based on other implementations [225,262] which may offer better performance and flexibility. Other methods are also offered within the TMVA package, and have slowly also found their way to scientific publications of physics results; in the last few years neural networks, particularly in their \"deep\" form (DNN, for \"deep neural network\") have started to be used for LHC searches. Frequently used implementations are ones based the Keras library [263] or the package called TensorFlow [264]. Neural networks are built out of several layers of nodes. In a first input layer the network receives the value of each of the features that define the object under evaluation. Each additional layer contains nodes that combine the inputs using custom activator functions; the nodes output the result to selected nodes of the next layer. A final output layer produces, in the simplest two-class implementation, a binary output. Deep networks have tens, or even hundreds of internal \"hidden\" layers. Some examples of the use of DNN architectures for LHC results are mentioned in Sec. 6.",

The need to combine many partly independent searches, each affected by uncertainties related to channelspecific features, as well as by uncertainties partly or fully correlated with those of other channels, has led to intensive studies by an inter-experimental working group [265], and to the production of custom routines implementing the agreed-upon analysis procedures [266]. In synergy with those activities, some significant breakthroughs have been achieved in practical statistical tools. One of them enabled the use of approximate formulae for confidence intervals, significantly easing the task of scanning largedimension parameter spaces in new physics searches [267]. A second study provided a simple method to estimate the significance of a departure of data from the \"null hypothesis\" -the one according to which data are sampled from a background-only model-in the context of \"simple versus composite\" hypothesis tests, i.e. in the presence of a nuisance parameter defined only in the \"alternative hypothesis\" -the one defined by a signal-plus-background model [268]; the classical example of this setup is the search for a new particle in a mass distribution, where the unknown particle mass plays the role of the nuisance parameter. HEP physicists have dubbed the inflation of the estimated signal significance as \"Look-Elsewhere Effect\" (LEE) . The method devised in [268] enables a non-CPU-intensive evaluation of the \"global significance\" of an observed effect, accounting for the multiplicity of ways by which the signal may appear in the search. One should however note that only the local significance of a signal search may be well-defined, given the arbitrariness intrinsic in the definition of the range of variability allowed to the nuisance parameter describing the composite alternative hypothesis [269].",

            "text": "The treatment of systematic uncertainties in new particle searches by ATLAS and CMS is similar, in the sense that the two experiments usually employ the same analysis techniques to search for signals and set upper limits on signal strength parameters. In fact, those techniques have been largely developed through a common effort, as is the case of the very important methodology and corresponding algorithms originally used for the Higgs boson searches and measurements [265] but now also commonly employed for Beyond-the-Standard Model (BSM) searches, or tweaked to reflect an agreed-upon consensus and to establish useful standards in inter-experimental working groups. The benefit of this similarity is a much easier combination of the experimental results; e.g. the consistent treatment of common sources of uncertainty allows for a correct treatment of correlations. Combination procedures have however limited application in the case of new resonance searches, as the collaborations have less interest in combining null results than to collaborate in producing a more credible and robust signal when the chance arises to do so. Unfortunately, the latter situation has not arisen so far, except of course in the case of the Higgs boson discovery and the measurement of its parameters [82,83]. Within each collaboration the combination of search results of different final states of the same production process is more common, and there the common breakdown of the various sources of systematic uncertainty into the independent contributions eases significantly the task of a proper statistical treatment. It is important to note, though, that systematic uncertainties in new physics searches are often sub-dominant with respect to statistical ones; combined with the accelerating speed at which the LHC has been producing data in the past eight years, this reduces the importance and the impact of a careful assessment of all sources of systematics. The construction of a complete likelihood function which incorporates the effect of a variation of nuisance parameters is the typical modus operandi of statistical inference at the LHC. Effects that impact the normalization of background processes are usually modeled by Log-normal or Gamma priors, while systematic sources that produce smearings due to the combined effect of many small shifts are of course modeled by Gaussian priors. In frequentist treatments such as the one designed for the Higgs search already mentioned supra, systematic effects are assessed by expressing the related nuisance parameters as a function of the parameters of interest, evaluating the so-called \"profile likelihood\". This is typically done through the generation of a large number of pseudo-experiments; one important detail is that in the generation of the pseudo-experiments the value of all the nuisance parameters should be varied within their assumed probability density functions, rather than kept fixed. In Bayesian calculations, the treatment of nuisance parameters is operated with a marginalization, by integrating over their PDF [275,273].",

When functional forms are used to parametrize the background shape as discussed supra (Sec. 5.2), a common procedure consists in fitting various different functions to the data, determining the variation in the parameter of interest that results from different plausible fits. However, the arbitrariness intrinsic in the choice of the functional forms considered in these procedure is difficult to handle. A recent technique to assess in a consistent way the systematic uncertainty in such cases has been proposed in [276]. The idea is to associate to the choice of background model a discrete nuisance parameter, which can be profiled in the likelihood maximization similarly to continuous nuisances. In this case one does not rely on any single well-determined model for the interpretation of the background shape, but rather uses all models together. The technique has been successfully used by CMS measurements of Higgs boson properties based on the h \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 decay mode [277]. An open issue in the application of the discrete profiling method is the choice of penalty term that should be added to the likelihoods employing functions that use a larger number of parameters. This can be operated using the Akaike information criterion [278], or by using the p-value of the resulting fits.",

In searches that involve final state including hadronic jets, the jet energy scale is usually one of the dominant sources of uncertainty; in dijet mass spectra, in particular, the QCD background falls very steeply with increasing dijet mass, so even a small uncertainty in the energy scale may turn into a large rate uncertainty.

When the final states are purely leptonic other uncertainties may instead dominate, such as the lepton identification and trigger efficiency, as well as uncertainties related to the knowledge of the momentum scale (for muons) or energy scale (for electrons). In all cases the presence of an explicit jet veto in the data selection may affect significantly the precision of signal efficiency, as was recognized recently after a discrepancy in W W production cross section with SM predictions was back-traced to imprecise estimates of soft QCD effects [284]. Other theoretical uncertainties affecting the signal rate include the knowledge of the PDF in the relevant kinematic range of production of the resonance, as well as systematics related to the modeling of initial and final state radiation, and the factorization and renormalization scale. Sources of uncertainty affecting background estimates produced by MC simulation include the knowledge of the theoretical cross sections, initial and final state radiation modeling, choice of scales and the choice of generator used for the modeling, as well as the choice of the PDF model. When backgrounds are estimated with data-driven techniques many of the above sources do not apply, and the typical leading uncertainty is then related to the finite statistics of the employed control regions (in case those are used for the extraction of fake rates or shape extrapolations), or the above mentioned choice of the functional form used to model the background shape.",

In the following few years of running, the SppS collider provided UA1 and UA2 [291] with proton-antiproton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 630 GeV. Signatures of pairs of weak bosons (W W and W Z) were sought for in final states with multiple leptons or two leptons and two hadronic jets. Indeed, in 1987 the UA1 experiment reported observing two events containing the signature of a high-transverse-momentum W boson decaying to lepton-neutrino pair accompanied by two recoiling hadronic jets from a luminosity of 0.7 pb \u22121 collected between 1982 and 1985 at center-of-mass energies of 546 and 630 GeV [292]. The unavailability of reliable calculations of QCD radiation processes in those years allowed for speculations on the possible origin of those events from the decay of a heavier resonance; it later became clear that better simulations of W + jets processes needed to be used to interpret the data, and that the occurrence of energetic gluon radiation was not as rare as until then thought in electroweak production processes.",

In addition to the higher energy than the Tevatron collider, the LHC experiments soon reaped benefits from the newly developed sub-jet vector-boson tagging techniques in high-p T wide jets, which added a new dimension to the quest. Due to the large branching fraction of W and Z bosons to jet pairs, the addition of mixed topologies (e.g. one hadronic and one leptonic decay) or fully-hadronic final states significantly enhanced the experimental sensitivity to new high-mass particles. In this section we review the published results by grouping them by the bosonic final state they considered.",

CMS produced a search for RS gravitons along with several other resonances in [325], by considering the all-hadronic final state of vector boson pairs; they could not place mass limits due to the high-mass region investigated in the study, which considered sub-jet tagging of high-p T wide jets.

The HVT model was considered by one ATLAS analysis [323] and two CMS analyses [328,329] studying the W W final state. ATLAS considered both model A and model B with narrow widths for the heavy bosons. The lower limit at 95% C.L on the mass of the resonance for the latter was set at 2.6 TeV by combining W Z and W W final states. In the first analysis targeting heavy-vector triplet bosons [328], CMS set 95% CL limits on model A and B by considering singlet and triplet resonances, also combining the results of the W W channel with those of the search in the W Z final state. In the singlet case W bosons were excluded below 2.0 or 2.2 TeV and Z bosons with masses below 1.6 and 1.7 TeV for models A and B, respectively, and in the triplet hypothesis, spin-1 resonances were excluded with masses below 2.3 and 2.4 TeV, respectively. The second CMS study [329] slightly tightened the above bounds to 2.3 TeV for a singlet W , 2.2 and 2.3 TeV for a singlet Z in model A and model B respectively, and 2.4 TeV for heavy triplets in both models, again by combining different channels and including signatures other than the W W one.",

Heavy Higgs bosons were considered in the ATLAS search described in [321]. That study considered three different scenarios: heavy neutrals with a narrow natural width, ones with an intermediate width \u0393 H in the range 0.2 < \u0393 H /\u0393 H SM < 0.8, and ones with a lineshape predicted by a model called \"complex pole scheme\" (CPS) [332,333,334], and width corresponding to the one predicted for the SM Higgs. The CPS produces a precise determination of the lineshape of Higgs bosons; for masses below 400 GeV the difference with a Breit-Wigner distribution is however negligible. 95% CL upper limits on the production cross section of a heavy Higgs state multiplied by its branching fraction to W W pairs were separately obtained for the gluon-gluon fusion production and the vector-boson fusion production hypotheses, for Higgs masses ranging from 300 to 1500 GeV. In the ATLAS search on Run 2 data already mentioned above [323], a heavy CP-even scalar singlet model was also considered [335]. Scalar resonances were excluded for masses below 2.65 TeV. In the CMS search reported in [324], a fermiophobic Higgs boson was considered. In fermiophobic Higgs models, the Higgs boson decays to vector bosons are strongly enhanced, making the searches more sensitive. CMS combined the result of searches in the W W , ZZ, and \u03b3\u03b3 final states, including a total of 32 independent sub-channels. The mass region between 110 and 300 GeV was investigated, and an exclusion of the mass range  GeV obtained at 95% CL.",

The statistical significance of the largest signals was assessed at the level of two standard deviations after accounting for the trials factors resulting from the multiplicity of independent locations where fluctuations could arise in the considered distributions. Most of the excesses were inconsistent across different channels and did not raise particular interest, but one excess found in the invariant mass of dijet-tagged wide-jet pairs by ATLAS [320] was considered more seriously by the theoretical physics community, with suggested explanations ranging from bulk gravitons [320], to composite particles [336,337,338,339,340,341], to W or Z bosons [342,343,344,345,346,347,348,349,350,351,352,353]. All three selections of W W , W Z, and ZZ event candidates showed hints of a signal in the 2 TeV mass region, with local significances evaluated respectively at the level of 2.6\u03c3, 3.4\u03c3, and 2.9\u03c3. About 20% of the events included in the three selections were common to all, and the global significance of the combined dataset was estimated at 2.5\u03c3. The observed effect did not increase when the dijet-tagged search was combined with results of analysis of the leptonic decay modes in [322]. CMS saw a very mild excess of events at slightly lower mass (1.9 TeV) in a search in the same all-hadronic final state [326], but the effect (a local significance of about 1.5\u03c3) was found most prominent in the \"single-V-tagged\" selection targeting excited quark decays q * \u2192 qV . Eventually, later searches did not confirm the effect, which was finally assessed as a statistical fluctuation.",

            "text": "As is evident in Table 6.2.2, the extended gauge model was considered as a benchmark by most ATLAS searches for resonances decaying to W Z pairs, and often also by CMS. ATLAS excluded at 95% CL W bosons with masses below 0.76 TeV in an early search in the leptonic final state [354], then below 0.95 TeV in a mixed final state with W \u2192 l\u03bd decays and non-boosted jets [318], and below 1.52 TeV in an 8-TeV search again using the leptonic signature [355]. A 1.59 TeV limit was soon therafter obtained in the llqq final state in the same dataset [356], using both resolved and merged jets from W decay; the same methodology, but employing W \u2192 l\u03bd decays and Z \u2192 qq ones, obtained a slightly lower exclusion at 1.49 TeV [319]. In the fully-hadronic search [320], as mentioned supra (Sec. 6.2.1) ATLAS saw a 3.4\u03c3 excess of events in the 2-TeV region of their W Z selection (see Fig. 2), and excluded W bosons in the 1.3-1.5 TeV range. The strongest limit came from the combination of search channels reported in [322], which excluded EGM W bosons below 1.81 TeV (see Fig. 3, left). The CMS experiment considered explicitly the EGM model in only one search in 8-TeV data [360], which used a fully leptonic final state and obtained a 95% CL lower limit at 1.55 TeV on W bosons. In the other cases the SSM was considered, with lower mass limits set at 1.14 TeV in a fully leptonic search in 7-TeV data [358], and at 0.94 TeV in a semileptonic search with W bosons decaying into a wide jet [359]. The search reported in [325] targeted high W masses with V-tagged dijet events, and obtained tight cross section limits but did not explicitly exclude a mass range for the resonance; the same final state was considered in data collected at 8 TeV, when a lower mass limit for a heavy W  [329] boson was set at 1.7 TeV [326]. Several searches that targeted the W Z signature also set limits on the HVT. ATLAS obtained 95% CL limits at 1.49 TeV for model A and 1.56 TeV for model B using the fully leptonic final state [355]; those limits got significantly extended to 2.35 and 2.6 TeV, respectively, by a combined search employing 13-TeV data collected in 2015 [323]. CMS excluded W singlets in the HVT below masses of 2.0 (2.2) TeV for model A (B) in a search combining the fully-hadronic and the semileptonic final states in 2015 data [328]. A more recent combination using both 8-and 13-TeV datasets allowed to extend the limits to 2.3 (2.4) TeV, respectively [329]. Results of the ATLAS and CMS searches in 13-TeV data collected in 2015, in the parameter space of the HVT, are compared in Fig. 4.",

The final states with four charged leptons are the cleanest, with backgrounds mainly due to Z pair production and other minor electroweak contributions; however they have a very small branching ratio overall, so they do not offer themselves to searches for rare processes at high invariant mass; that role is better covered by the final states including highlyboosted jets with substructure. ATLAS and CMS have pursued all the available signatures, combining results and obtaining stringent limits on resonances that may decay to Z boson pairs. Table 6.2.3 contains a summary of the relevant searches, the considered new physics models, and the references.",

            "text": "The reference for most LHC searches in the ZZ final state is the Randall-Sundrum model with bulk gravitons. The 95% CL exclusion limits obtained by ATLAS on the rate of ZZ resonances, interpreted as upper bounds on the production cross section for G * bulk states, were turned into constraints of the graviton mass. The range 325-845 GeV was excluded by the early analysis reported in [364]; the bound m * G < 740 (540) GeV was obtained by the search for ZZ \u2192 llqq candidates in the full 8-TeV dataset [356] by consideringk = 1.0 (0.5), respectively. In the same data sample, the analysis of the fully-hadronic final state [320] resulted in tight cross section bounds for masses above 1.3 TeV but no mass range exclusion. Finally, the already reported combination of multiple searches in 8-TeV data [322] resulted in a lower limit at 810 GeV; a combination of results of searches in the 2015 dataset of 13- Figure 4: 95% CL exclusion contours in the HVT parameter space obtained by the ATLAS analysis reported in [323] for resonances of mass 1.2 TeV, 2 TeV and 3 TeV. Points of parameter space in the hatched area correspond to widths of the resonance above 5% of its mass, which were not directly tested by the search. Right: the corresponding result obtained by the CMS analysis [328], which considered resonance masses of 1.5, 2.0, and 3.5 TeV. Again, the hatched area corresponds to \u0393 W /m W values above 0.05, which would modify the signal shape and change the experimental results.  [329] TeV collisions [323] produced a 95% CL exclusion of masses below 1.1 TeV, as already reported supra (Sec. 6.2.1). CMS sought for RS gravitons in six analyses; the first three, using data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of about 5 f b \u22121 of 7-TeV collisions 5 , considered the original RS model; the latter three considered the bulk graviton version. In the first study [366], based on 7-TeV data, an exclusion at 95% CL of gravitons with mass m G * < 945 GeV (< 720 GeV and in the range 760-850 GeV) was obtained by assumingk = 0.1 (0.05), respectively. In the second one [359], limits were presented for both a LO calculation and the inclusion of NLO effects [367,368]; the latter significantly increases the predicted cross section. Fork = 0.05 masses below 803 (879) GeV were excluded at NLO (LO). As already reported supra (Sec. 6.2.1), the fully-hadronic search of [325] could not exclude any mass range, although it could obtain stringent cross-section limits for very high graviton masses. For bulk gravitons, the 8-TeV and 13-TeV analyses reported in [327,328,329] were already mentioned in Sec. 6.2.1.",

For the new resonance search they based their signal model on the \"technicolour strawman model\" of [370], implemented in the Pythia package [237]. They considered neutral and charged technimesons, with four technicolours and a mass splitting between the new particles given by m a T = 1.1m \u03c1 T = 1.1m \u03c9 T and m \u03c1 T \u2212 m \u03c0 T = m W , in accordance to searches for low-scale technicolour [111,112] previously performed in W Z and dilepton decay modes. With these choices for the relationship among the technihadron masses, all searched for resonances have widths narrower than the experimental resolution. The signals of \u03c9 T \u2192 Z\u03b3 and a T \u2192 W \u03b3 were parametrized by a Crystal Ball function, with a Gaussian component added to the \u03c9 T shape. The fits of observed mass distributions to SM backgrounds and the signal templates produced cross section limits which, once compared to the considered technicolour model, were turned into 95% CL lower limits on the mass of \u03c9 T at 494 GeV, and on the mass of a T at 703 GeV. The same final state was later considered for a search in the full 2012 dataset of 8-TeV collisions, corresponding to a luminosity of 20.3 f b \u22121 [371]. The a T technihadron decay to W \u03b3 was excluded at 95% CL for masses below 960 GeV, and the \u03c9 T was excluded for all masses in the range  GeV (except for the region 700-750 GeV), by searching for its Z\u03b3 decay. Two benchmarks of the composite scalar model [372,373] were also studied with the Z\u03b3 final state: a first one with couplings suggested by a \"naive dimensional analysis\" [374] and a second with larger couplings to electroweak gauge bosons [375,376,373]. No exclusion was obtained in the first benchmark, while in the second one masses of the heavy composite scalar were excluded in most of the range below 1180 GeV.",

The first one was based on the study of a total luminosity of 19.7 f b \u22121 of 8-TeV collisions and 2.7 f b \u22121 of 13-TeV collisions, acquired respectively in 2012 and 2015, and considered final states produced by Z boson decays to electron-positron or muon pairs [380]. By collecting events with photon candidates associated with a high-p T lepton pair allowed to select data mostly constituted by electroweak Z boson production with hard photon radiation from the initial state, with some residual contamination from Z+jet production with misidentified photons. The background was collectively parametrized by the sum of three exponential functions. No significant signal was observed in the investigated spectra, and 95% CL limits were extracted on the product of cross section times branching fraction of the heavy resonance to Z\u03b3 in the range from 280 to 20 f b for values of m X in the 200-2000 GeV range. The most recent result [379] was based on the analysis of the same integrated luminosity of the previously mentioned search, but considered decays of the Z boson into both light-quark pairs and bb quark pairs, by using jet substructure techniques to identify the Z decay products inside jets reconstructed with a R = 0.8 cone. The search investigated the mass range from 650 GeV to 3 TeV, using photon plus wide-jet events selected by requiring photons of p T > 170(180) GeV and jets with p T > 170 (200) GeV for the analysis of 8-TeV (13-TeV) data. Two non-overlapping event categories were considered to be sensitive separately to generic hadronic Z decays or ones to bb pairs. The Z \u2192 bb selection required that at least one b-tag were found by the CSV algorithm above its medium-purity working point in one of the narrow-cone jets identified within the wide jets, when the other jet also passed the loose working point of the CSV algorithm. The search did not find any excess over a smooth background parametrization in the two event classes. Limits on the resonance cross section times its branching fraction into Z\u03b3 final state were obtained by combining the results with those of the previous search for Z\u03b3 using leptonic Z decays [380]. The 95% CL limits ranged from 300 f b to 3.5 f b for resonance masses in the interval 200-3000 GeV (see Fig. 5).",

Higher-spin parents are also possible, although not considered fashionable by existing literature. The fact that the 125 GeV Higgs boson displays couplings resembling those predicted in the SM means that in the context of 2HDMs the favoured parameter space region is close to the alignment limit \u03b1 = \u03b2.

While the 7-and 8-TeV searches produced null results in the investigated mass spectra, the first analysis of 2015 data by ATLAS reported a peaking excess of events at a mass of about 750 GeV, with a local statistical significance exceeding three standard deviations. In conjunction, the CMS experiment also reported a similar effect at the same diphoton mass, with a lower significance. The reported anomalies, jointly made public in an end-of-the-year seminar at CERN in December 2015, caused an explosion of theoretical interest in potential new physics models that could produce the observed effect. Over the course of the following six months more than 600 articles were submitted to the Cornell arXiv [392]. That enthusiasm was however soon dampened by the sobering results of searches that included the larger 2016 datasets, which basically killed the earlier signal, ascertaining its statistical nature of an upward fluctuation. A part of the large body of produced literature in that short time span is still very useful as it offers creative new mechanisms for new physics beyond the SM, and it provides a demonstration of how diboson signatures may be a versatile investigative tool.",

The signal had a broad Gaussian-like shape, of width of about 50 GeV, centered at a mass of 750 GeV. Two different methods for the prediction of the background shape, a first one based on a functional parametrization and a second one based on a MC simulation of photon pair production at next-to-leading order using Diphox [393] and a data-driven model of spurious backgrounds from photon+jet and dijet events, returned similar results. The local significance of the signal was estimated at 3.8\u03c3 or 3.9\u03c3, depending on the tested signal hypothesis (spin-2 or spin-0, respectively); once corrected for the LEE the significance was estimated at 2.1\u03c3. In the case of a narrow signal, the local significance estimates decreased to 3.3\u03c3 and 2.9\u03c3 for the spin-2 and spin-0 hypothesis, respectively. The mass distribution of photon pairs reported by ATLAS in [390] is shown in Fig. 6 (left). As previously mentioned, preliminary results from the first half of 2016 data were sufficient to disprove the existence of a resonance at 750 GeV; ATLAS waited for the collection of the full 2016 dataset before producing a new publication [391]. Due to its relevance we report it here although it is only available as a preprint at the time of writing. The reported study includes a total luminosity of 36.7 f b \u22121 of 13-TeV collisions. An improved calibration procedure of photons brought the reanalysed 2015 data to show a smaller signal component in the mass range where the original effect had been located: significances for the two signal hypotheses (spin-2 and spin-0) were now estimated at 3.3\u03c3 and 3.2\u03c3, respectively. The combination of the 2015 and 2016 datasets produced results in better agreement with the background-only hypothesis, with global significances of the largest deviations well below the 1\u03c3 level. The analysis allowed to exclude at 95% CL gravitons with mass below 4.1 TeV in the RS model withk = 0.1.",

In the first one [383] they reported on the analysis of a luminosity of 2.2 f b \u22121 of 7-TeV protonproton collisions. The search considered both the RS graviton and the ADD model, setting 95% CL limits in the range 0.86-1.84 TeV as a function of the normalized coupling strengthk. For the ADD model the limits ranged in the 2.3-3.8 TeV. The second study considered the full integrated luminosity collected at 8 TeV in 2012 [384], amounting to 19.7 f b \u22121 , and produced a search for X \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 resonances in the mass range 150-850 GeV, targeting both spin-0 and spin-2 resonances of natural widths in the 0.1 GeV to 0.1 m X range. Events were categorized into four classes of different purities depending on the pseudorapidity of the photons and the value of the variable R 9 (see Sec. 4.1), and the four searches were then combined. The data were found to be in good agreement with a smooth data-driven background model in all classes, and a 95% CL upper limit on the signal cross section times resonance branching fraction to photon pairs was extracted as a function of the resonance mass. The results were also interpreted in the context of the 2HDM in the (tan \u03b2, cos(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1)) plane.",

The 2015 data considered were both ones taken with the central solenoid at its nominal field of 3.8 Tesla, and ones taken when the magnet was de-energized for servicing; four classes of events were studied separately as in the previous publication, to improve the sensitivity of the search. A modest excess over background predictions was observed in the vicinity of 750 GeV, with a local (global) statistical significance of 3.4\u03c3 (1.6\u03c3). The search also set 95% upper  [390]. The background is fit with a smooth functional form and is subtracted in the lower inset. Right: 95% CL upper limits on the 13-TeV cross section of diphoton resonances times branching fraction to photon pairs produced by CMS using 8-and 13-TeV data [386], as a function of the resonance mass m X . The grey and green curves show the exclusion limits for the scalar and RS graviton, respectively. From top to bottom, the limits refer to values of the dimensionless couplingk = 0.01,k = 0.1, andk = 0.2. limits on RS graviton production, from which lower limits at 95% CL could be extracted for gravitons at masses of 1.6, 3.3, and 3.8 TeV for values ofk = 0.01, 0.1, and 0.2, respectively. Finally, in [386] CMS produced a search in a data sample corresponding to 12.9 f b \u22121 of 13-TeV collisions collected in 2016, and combined those results with the analysis of the datasets already reported earlier [385]. The search did not find any significant signal in the investigated mass spectrum, and set limits at 95% confidence level on the mass of spin-2 RS gravitons at 1.95 to 4.45 TeV depending on the values of the dimensionless coupling parameterk in the range 0.01 -0.2, as well as limits on the mass of scalar resonances produced by gluon-gluon fusion (see Fig. 6, right).",

The full 20.3 f b \u22121 of 8-TeV collisions acquired in the 2012 run was considered for the search. For the decay mode including \u03c4 leptons, all three combinations of observable \u03c4 decays to hadrons or leptons were considered (\u03c4 h \u03c4 h , \u03c4 h \u03c4 l , and \u03c4 l \u03c4 l ); the resonance mass was estimated by computing the combination m 4 = m ll\u03c4 \u03c4 \u2212 m ll \u2212 m \u03c4 \u03c4 + m Z + m h , which increases the resolution by using known mass values for the Z and h bosons. In the llbb category, two b-tagged jets were required, and additional criteria were imposed to reject the background from top pair production. In the \u03bd\u03bdbb search several kinematic criteria were imposed to reduce QCD backgrounds. No significant signal was observed in any of the search categories, and upper limits were set at 95% CL on the product of A boson cross section times the branching fraction of the A \u2192 Zh decay times the branching fraction of the Higgs boson to bb or \u03c4 \u03c4 .

Events were required to contain two jets, either or both b-tagged by the MV2 algorithm [219]; the invariant mass of the jet pair was required to be in the 105-145 GeV range. Further channel-specific selection cuts were applied in the three considered leptonic decay categories. All backgrounds were estimated with MC simulations of the relevant processes, except the one arising from QCD multijet production, estimated with data-driven methods. All search channels were found in agreement with background predictions in the four-body mass distributions (the transverse mass was used in the \u03bd\u03bdbb channel).

One of the W bosons was required to decay to an electron-neutrino or muon-neutrino pair, and the other to a pair of jets.

The number of b-tags (one or two) and the number of leptons (zero, one, or two) allowed to define six categories, where resonant signals were sought for by studying the four-body mass or the transverse mass (in the zero-lepton cases) distribution. The absence of any significant signal was turned into upper limits on the production cross section of the considered resonances times branching fractions of h \u2192 bb or cc (the ratio of branching fraction of h to the two heavy quark pairs was considered fixed); for the W limits the 0-and 1-lepton categories were fit together, and for Z limits the 0-and 2-lepton categories were used. Using model A of the HVT scenario with g V = 1, ATLAS excluded at 95% CL a W boson with mass in the 200-1750 GeV range and a Z of mass in the 200-1490 GeV range; using model B and g V = 3, the exclusions were respectively in the range 200 < m W < 2220 GeV and 200 < m Z < 1580 GeV; those limits were obtained by fixing the Higgs branching fraction to heavy quarks to its SM value [218]. Considering the two heavy bosons degenerate in mass, and fitting all data categories together, the limit was set at 1730 GeV (2310 GeV) for model A and B, respectively. The search in Run 2 data collected in 2015 and 2016, corresponding to a total of 36.1 f b \u22121 of integrated luminosity of 13-TeV collisions reported in [404], is the most recent result by ATLAS on V h resonances at the time of writing. The analysis considered the all-hadronic decay mode of the SM bosons. Events containing two R = 1.0 anti-k T jets with transverse momentum thresholds p T > 450 (250) GeV on the leading (sub-leading) jet were considered, searching for narrow R = 0.2 k T jets within the wide jet cones. Jets were trimmed by discarding narrow k T jets with a p T of less than 5% of the total p T of the wide jet; the jet mass was recomputed after trimming using both tracking and calorimeter information, to improve the mass resolution [405]. b-tagging optimized to boosted jets [403] was applied on track-jets inside the wide cones to identify the h \u2192 bb decay candidate. Vector boson candidate jets were identified by 50%-efficient substructure criteria [406]. The events were finally divided in four classes depending on the number of b-tags and on whether the vector-boson wide jet were compatible with a W or Z decay candidate. A statistical analysis was used to test different mass hypotheses for heavy bosons in the HVT model. A signal with a local significance of 3.3 standard deviations was obtained at a mass of 3 TeV from the fit of the Zh final state data categories; the global significance of the excess was estimated at 2.1\u03c3. Fig. 7 shows the data in the four considered search categories. Finally, 95% CL limits were set on the parameter space of the HVT, and for the considered model B W bosons were excluded in the mass region 1.1-2.5 TeV, and Z bosons in the mass region 1.1-2.6 TeV.",

On-shell Z \u2192 ee and Z \u2192 \u00b5\u00b5 decays of the Z boson were considered, while the Higgs boson was sought in its bb decay mode. In 2HDM theories the A boson can be effectively sought for in the considered final state if its mass is above m h + m Z \u223c 216 GeV and below the A \u2192 tt threshold; in addition, within a wide range of parameter space the h \u2192 bb decay has a large branching fraction [408]. Events were selected to contain a leptonic Z boson decay and two jets with a CSV b-tag, one above the tight working point of the algorithm and the other above the loose one (see Sec. 4.6). A kinematic fit was performed to the signal hypothesis by constraining the Z and h masses to their known values; the fit produced a narrow four-body distribution for the signal templates, as shown in Fig. 8. Background contributions were mainly due to electroweak production of vector bosons and jets, along with top pair-production; they were estimated from MC simulations and their rates validated with control samples enriched in each of the main components. Three disjunct mass regions were studied independently, and for each a BDT classifier was trained to separate the signal from backgrounds. The resulting mass distributions in high-BDT events did not show excesses above predicted backgrounds, and 95% CL limits were set on the A cross section (Fig. 8, right). The limits were interpreted as exclusions of the (tan \u03b2, cos(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1)) parameter space of Type-I and Type-II 2HDM.",

In both considered final states, the lighter scalar was sought for in its decay to a pair of b-quarks or a \u03c4 \u03c4 pair, while the Z boson was identified through its decay to an ee or \u00b5\u00b5 pair.

The pruned mass of the wide jets was used, along with the \u03c4 21 and \u03c4 42 subjettiness variables, to reduce the overwhelming QCD background. While \u03c4 21 can distinguish how well a single jet conforms to the hypothesis of being produced by the hadronization of two separate, energetic quarks emitted from a boosted vector boson decay, \u03c4 42 provides information on the validity of the hadronic W W decay hypothesis altogether. The h \u2192 bb decay was identified by requiring that the sub-jets associated to h decay in a wide jet had a CSV b-tagging value above its loose working point when they had an angular separation above \u2206R > 0.3; for narrower pairs, the b-tagging requirement was applied to the wide CA jet. The mass distribution of W h candidates in the data was fit by parametrizing the background, predominantly constituted by QCD multijet production, with a smooth four-parameter function, and the signal with a Gaussian shape of 5%-10% relative resolution. The absence of any significant signal in the investigated mass range was used to set upper limits on the cross section of a heavy W or Z boson in the context of the HVT model. The resulting 95% CL excluded mass ranges were 1.0 < m Z < 1.1 TeV and 1.3 < m Z < 1.5 TeV for a Z boson, and 1.0 < m W < 1.6 TeV for a W boson; a mass-degenerate state of W and Z In a fourth study of the same 2012 dataset [415], CMS considered the W \u2192 W h \u2192 l\u03bdbb decay chain, using the same analysis method of their search for high-mass W W resonances already discussed supra [324], and including b-tagging to identify the Higgs decay in the boosted jet as they did in their fully-hadronic W h search [414]. The study reported observing three events in the e\u03bdbb topology with a mass of about 1.8 TeV, where backgrounds yielded an estimated 0.3 events (see Fig. 10). No similar excess was observed in the \u00b5\u03bdbb channel, and the significance of the data was estimated at the level of 1.9\u03c3 once accounting for the LEE. A limit was set at 95% CL on the cross section of W production in HVT and LH models; once converted into lower mass limits, a W boson of mass below 1.4 TeV was excluded in the LH model, and below 1.5 TeV in HVT model B [73], which mimics the properties of a composite Higgs scenario; in the latter case, a combination with the fully hadronic CMS search in the same dataset allowed to extend the lower mass limit to 1.8 TeV.",

A dataset corresponding to a luminosity of 2.2 to 2.5 f b \u22121 of 13-TeV collisions acquired in 2015 was used [328] to search for leptonic W and Z decays accompanied by a high-p T wide jet with substructure, tagged to be originated by h \u2192 bb decay. Both the W \u2192 l\u03bd, the Z \u2192 \u03bd\u03bd, and the Z \u2192 ll final states of vector boson decays were considered, with l = e, \u00b5. The search allowed to extend the lower mass limit on heavy vector bosons in HVT model B, considered in their previous publication [414], to 2 TeV. A search in the fully-hadronic topology of V h decays was performed [416] using 35.9 f b \u22121 of 13-TeV collisions, targeting the still untested high-mass region. At variance with  [414]. The data (points with 68% CL uncertainty bars) are compared with estimated backgrounds from W +jets and tt production; the expected shape of a HVT W signal with a mass of 1.5 TeV is overlaid. Right: observed exclusion limit on the HVT parameter space for three different values of the heavy boson mass (1.5, 2.0, and 3.0 TeV) obtained by the CMS analysis in [416]. Models A and B are represented by a cross and a point, respectively. In the shaded area outside the oval in the graph, the narrow-width approximation is inapplicable.",

The interest of that process, which will likely require the full integrated luminosity collected during the future high-luminosity program of the LHC to be put in evidence, stems from the direct access that the triangle diagram provides to the measurement of the Higgs self-coupling parameter \u03bb of the SM Lagrangian, and consequently to the test of possible SM extensions with anomalous couplings. Yet the final state of two Higgs bosons can also naturally arise in new physics models that predict the decay of a heavy narrow resonance (denoted by the letter X in the following, when no specific model is referred to in particular). The cross section of that process could be large enough to be testable with the datasets currently available. Examples of classes of theories that can be probed are the singlet model [419,420,421], the 2HDM [88], the MSSM [90,91,92,93,94,95], and models with warped extra dimensions [330,422].",

Because of that, fully reconstructed final states like bbbb and bb\u03b3\u03b3 turn out to be comparatively more sensitive than partly-reconstructed ones, such as those including e.g. one h \u2192 W W decay with leptonic W final states. In addition, jet substructure techniques have proven able to significantly increase the sensitivity by allowing the identification of h \u2192 bb decays in high-momentum jets of high visible mass [423].The LHC experiments have produced a number of searches for resonances decaying into hh pairs, leveraging on those ideas.

They found an excess event rate above predicted backgrounds in the signal region with a local significance of 3.0 standard deviations. The impact of the LEE was estimated with pseudo-experiments, by considering the whole search region; this allowed the estimate of a global significance of 2.1 standard deviations. In the hypothesis of no signal in the data, ATLAS extracted upper limits at 95% CL on the product of resonance cross section times branching fraction into Higgs boson pairs at 3.5 to 0.7 pb for X masses ranging from 260 to 500 GeV. They compared their upper limits on signal cross section to predictions by a representative Type-I 2HDM model [425,426] not excluded by the data, obtained by setting cos(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1) = \u22120.05 and tan \u03b2 = 1, with mass-degenerate heavy H and A bosons, and with the light state h corresponding to the 125 GeV scalar. A second ATLAS study [427] of the same 2012 data sample considered the fully hadronic final state of two wide jets of high momentum, searching for the signature of two narrow b-tagged jets (the \"resolved\" analysis) or a wide jet with track-based b-tags within its area (the \"boosted\" search); the resolved analysis considered resonances of mass in the range 500-1500 GeV, while the boosted analysis could extend the sensitivity to 2000 GeV. In both cases a constraint on the reconstructed mass of the b-jet pair (in the resolved case) or of the trimmed fat jet (in the boosted case) to the mass of the 125 GeV Higgs boson helped increase the resolution on the mass of the four-body system. The absence of any significant signal in the data led to set constraints on several benchmark models: the bulk RS model withk = 1.0, 1.5, or 2.0, and 2HDM models with CP-conserving scalar potentials under the condition m H = m A = m + H , choosing a mixing parameter between the doublets such that m 12 = m 2 A tan \u03b2/(1 + tan 2 \u03b2) [428], and interpreting the results in the (tan \u03b2, cos(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1)) plane.",

The natural width of the heavy scalar is always smaller than the mass resolution on the Higgs pair system in the considered models, so no accounting was made for it. The cross section of the heavy Higgs was computed using SusHi 1.4.1 [411,412,413], and branching ratios were calculated with Hdecay [431] for the hMSSM, and with FeynHiggs [432,433,434] for the low-tb-high scenario.",

Three models were considered for the resonant search: spin-2 Kaluza-Klein gravitons withk = 2 andk = 1, and heavy Higgs-like spin-0 particles. The analysis employed a number of kinematical requirements on the four b-tagged jets selected for the resolved hh search, reducing backgrounds from QCD multijet production (modeled using data failing the b-tag requirement in one jet in each Higgs decay pair) and tt production (with shape modeled with MC). In the boosted topology two wide jets were selected with 250 < p T < 1500 GeV; at least three b-tags in R = 0.2 subjets within the R = 1.0 wide jets were required, defining two orthogonal categories depending on the b-tag properties of the fourth sub-jet. Backgrounds were estimated similarly to the resolved analysis. The searches did not return any significant signal in the investigated range of Higgspair masses, and upper limits in the cross section of the considered resonances were extracted with a profile likelihood technique, using the CL s criterion. For heavy spin-0 Higgs-like particles H a limit on the cross section times branching fraction squared of h \u2192 bb was set in the range from 30 to 300 f b for masses between 500 and 3000 GeV. For gravitons, the cross section limits were translated into restrictions on their mass ranges: in the case ofk = 2, an exclusion of the range 480 < m * G < 965 GeV; and assuming insteadk = 1 an exclusion of the range 480 < m * G < 770 GeV. CMS reported searching for a signal of H \u2192 hh \u2192 bb\u03c4 \u03c4 as well as A \u2192 Zh \u2192 ll\u03c4 \u03c4 decays using data corresponding to a luminosity of 19.7f b \u22121 of 8-TeV proton-proton collisions acquired in 2012, reporting the null results as model-independent 95% CL limit of \u223c 0.2pb on \u03c3(gg \u2192 H \u2192 hh) \u00d7 B(hh \u2192 bb\u03c4 \u03c4 ) for 260 < m H < 350 GeV and of 17 to 5 f b on \u03c3(gg \u2192 A \u2192 Zh) \u00d7 B(Z \u2192 ll) \u00d7 B(H \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 ) for 220 < m A < 350 GeV. These were turned into parameter space limits in the low-tan \u03b2 scenario of the MSSM [430], as well as in generic Type-II 2HDM models.",

Data were selected by a trigger collecting events containing at least four jets with p T > 30 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.4, two of which with p T > 80 GeV, and two jets b-tagged by a online CSV algorithm. Offline, the p T threshold was increased to 40 GeV, and events with four b-tagged jets were selected. Higgs decay candidates were reconstructed from pairs of b jets if |M bb \u2212 125| < 35 GeV. Since the kinematics of a heavy particle decay to four jets strongly depends on its mass, the selection criteria were further optimized with kinematic cuts in three separate search regions: 270 < M X < 450, 450 < M X < 730, and M X < 1100; for larger masses the b quarks from h decay merge into single jets, making the search method ineffective. CMS relied on a data-driven background-estimation technique to reduce the overwhelming background from QCD multijet processes, extrapolating the four-body mass distribution from events falling into quadrants of an annular region constructed around the signal region in the plane described by the two Higgs candidate masses (see Fig. 11, left). The procedure was validated using as a target events with both dijet masses around 90 GeV. The four-body mass distribution was then fit with a binned maximum likelihood technique as the sum of the data-driven background template, a top-pair background model extracted from MC, and a radion signal template obtained from a Madgraph simulation [439]. Limits to the mass of the radion from 350 to 1100 GeV were set at 95% CL in the scenario of zero mixing with the Higgs boson, considering a product of the warp factor k and the half-length of the extra dimension L set to 35, and a radion decay constant \u039b R = 1 TeV, using the theoretical cross section in [440]. For a spin-2 graviton a mass exclusion region was obtained between 380 and 830 GeV.",

The first one was produced by CMS using the final state including two b quarks, two charged leptons, and neutrinos, which may arise both from hh \u2192 bbW W and from hh \u2192 bbZZ decays [441]. Events were collected from a dilepton trigger, and required to contain two opposite-charge electrons or muons with 12 < m ll < M Z \u2212 15 GeV, a criterion aimed at reducing quarkonia decays, semileptonic B-hadron decays, and the high-tails of tt Figure 11: Left: kinematic regions defined in the (m h 1 , m h 2 ) plane of the reconstructed masses of the two h \u2192 bb decays, used to construct and validate the model of QCD backgrounds in the CMS search for X \u2192 hh \u2192 bbbb search [438].

Jets reconstructed with the anti-k T algorithm from PF candidates using a radius of 0.4 were required to have a CMVA value of b-tagging above the medium working point of the algorithm [223,224]. A deep neural network from the Keras package [263] was trained to distinguish signal events from the irreducible background arising from top quark pair production. Binned-likelihood fits to the DNN output discriminant in three different ranges of dijet mass were fit to extract upper limits on the signal component (see Fig. 12). The data allowed to set 95% CL limits to the cross section times branching ratio of narrow spin-zero resonances as well as spin-two resonances with minimal gravity-like couplings, in the mass range 260 < m X < 900 GeV. The limits range respectively from 430 to 17f b and from 450 to 14f b, as shown in Fig. 13.",

Anti-k T jets were obtained by clustering PF candidates within a cone of radius R = 0.5, and considered if they were well-separated in angle (\u2206R > 0.5) from photon candidates. At least one jet must contain a medium CSV b-tag; the pair of jets with highest combined p T was retained as product of Higgs decay. Events were then categorized according to the number of b-tags in the Higgs candidate jets. A kinematic fit was applied to the four Higgs decay products to improve the resolution on m X in the X \u2192 hh \u2192 bb\u03b3\u03b3 hypothesis. The search for the resonant signal distinguished a low-mass (260 < m X < 400 GeV) from a high-mass (400 < m X < 1100 GeV) region. In the background-rich low-mass region, for each m X hypothesis events were selected in a narrow interval of the four-body mass distribution, and the m \u03b3 1 \u03b3 2 and m bb distributions were searched for a signal component. In the high-mass region, where backgrounds were smaller, the m bb\u03b3 1 \u03b3 2 distribution was searched directly for a resonant signal. No significant signal was found in the data. Using theoretical predictions for the cross sections of the new resonances [109,440,444,443], an exclusion at 95% CL on the radion hypothesis with an ultraviolet cutoff scale \u039b R = 1 TeV was obtained for masses below 980 GeV; for \u039b R = 3 TeV the exclusion reduced to the mass region 200-300 GeV.

The bb\u03c4 \u03c4 decay mode has a combined branching fraction of 7.3% in the SM; the considered decay modes of \u03c4 lepton pairs were ones with one \u03c4 decaying to \u03bd \u03c4 plus hadrons, and the other decaying to either the same final state or to e\u03bd e \u03bd \u03c4 or \u00b5\u03bd \u00b5 \u03bd \u03c4 ; overall these combinations cover 88% of the possible decay modes of the \u03c4 lepton pairs. The mass of \u03c4 lepton pairs was computed with a dynamical likelihood technique [409]. Jets were reconstructed by identifying particles with the PF algorithm and clustering them with the anti-k T algorithm using jet radii of 0.4 and 0.8. The jet mass was computed for the larger cone radius jets using the soft-drop grooming algorithm [205]. A wide jet was classified as a boosted dijet candidate if it had a mass is larger than 30 GeV and was made by two subjets each geometrically matched to jets reconstructed with the anti-k T algorithm using the radius parameter R = 0.4. Events were divided in a high-and a low-purity category depending on having two or only one b-tagged jet. A four-body mass was finally obtained with a kinematic fit [446]. Backgrounds arising from Z\u03b3 \u2192 ll and W \u2192 l\u03bd in association with jets (with l = e, \u00b5, \u03c4 ), diboson (W W , ZZ, and W Z), and SM single Higgs boson production were simulated with Madgraph 5 [236], while the single top and tt backgrounds were simulated at NLO precision with POWHEG 2.0. The NNPDF3.0 [248] PDF set was used. The search sets model-independent cross section limits on the production of a narrow resonance decaying to Higgs pairs. In the context of the hMSSM scenario these correspond to a 95% CL exclusion of the region in parameter space 230 < m A < 360 GeV for tan \u03b2 < 2 (see Fig. 11, right).",

Before the LHC, searches for these light pseudoscalars targeting masses above the \u03c4 -pair production threshold were performed both at the Tevatron and at LEP II. ALEPH set a limit m H > 107 GeV searching for H \u2192 aa decays and assuming a branching fraction of unity for the decay [450]; DZERO also set limits on H \u2192 aa by searching in the \u00b5\u00b5\u03c4 \u03c4 final state [451]. At the LHC, the ATLAS collaboration sought for the signature of decays of the 125 GeV scalar into two a bosons in \u03c4 \u03c4 \u00b5\u00b5 and in bbbb final states; the present precision on the allowed branching fraction into undetected final states of Higgs decays still leaves considerable room for these possibilities. The first study was performed on 20.3 f b \u22121 of 8-TeV proton-proton collisions data collected in the 2012 run [452]. Events were selected to contain a muon pair plus an additional signature of \u03c4 lepton decays; the mass distribution of the muon pair assigned to the decay of an a boson was sought for narrow bumps. The absence of detected signals was turned into exclusion limits on the product of cross section of Higgs bosons times their branching fraction to a boson pairs, normalized to the SM production of Higgs bosons by gluon fusion; limits on the heavy-H mass were also obtained, in the hypothesis of m a = 5 GeV. A second search in a dataset corresponding to 3.2 f b \u22121 of 13-TeV collisions considered Higgs bosons produced in association with a W boson, and targeted the range 20 < m a < 60 GeV with both a bosons decaying to b quarks [453]. The experimental signature included an electron or muon and missing transverse energy from the decay of the W boson, and multiple hadronic jets from the a bosons decay; the leptons provided efficient triggers for the search. The data were selected to contain at least three jets, two or more b-tagged by a multi-variate discriminant using secondary vertex and soft lepton information; a further BDT discriminant was employed to separate the signal from the dominant background coming from tt decays. The search did not return any significant signal; ATLAS thus set 95% CL limits on the cross section of W H production times the branching fraction of the Higgs boson to an a pair and the squared branching fraction of a \u2192 bb. The limits range from 6.2 to 1.5 pb in the investigated interval of m a values.",

In a search on 19.7 f b \u22121 of 8-TeV collisions [454], they considered a bosons in the 2m \u00b5 \u22122m \u03c4 range in the context of the NMSSM and dark sector models [455,456,457,458]. Events with four muons were selected from data collected by a dimuon trigger, and a signal was sought in the plane defined by the invariant masses of muon pairs. Backgrounds from bb production and from prompt-and non-prompt-production of J/\u03c8 meson pairs were estimated with data-driven techniques. One event with the required characteristics was found in the search region, compatible with the estimated background of 2.2 \u00b1 0.7 events (see Fig. 14). The resulting rate limits were provided in a model-independent way and interpreted in the context of the NMSSM. A second search in the 2012 dataset was also performed for pairs of NMSSM bosons a 1 or h 1 produced in the decay of the Higgs boson, looking for the final state of four \u03c4 leptons [459]. This study focused on very light states, from 4 to 8 GeV. Events were selected by a dimuon trigger and required to contain a pair of same-sign muons, each accompanied by another isolated track identified as a one-prong \u03c4 decay candidate. The plane defined by the invariant masses of the two track-muon pairs, used as a discriminant of the diboson signal from QCD backgrounds, was fit with a binned likelihood technique to extract information on a possible signal component. The data were found to be well-modeled by backgrounds alone; this resulted in the setting of 95% CL upper limits on the product of production cross section times branching fraction of the Higgs boson into the pair of light bosons, times the squared branching fraction of the latter into \u03c4 lepton pairs. These vary from 4.5 to 10.3 pb in the considered mass range. Finally, the most recent publication by CMS [460] on the considered h \u2192 aa signature was based on the same dataset as the one above. It considered the higher mass range 5.0-62.5 GeV, and three different signatures of aa decay: the 4\u03c4 mode, the \u00b5\u00b5bb mode, and the \u03c4 \u03c4 \u00b5\u00b5 mode. Upper limits at 95% CL on the Higgs production cross section times branching fraction of h \u2192 aa, divided by the SM prediction for the Higgs cross section, were obtained by the searches down to values of 17%, 16% and 4% using the three decay modes.",

Here we however discuss only a subset of those results, focusing on searches for resonances decaying to gluon pairs, which rightfully belong to the class of diboson final states object of this review. While the signature of energetic quarks and gluons cannot be distinguished well enough to allow for an advantageous experimental categorization of dijet events as the result of the qq, qg, or gg final states, all models that predict the existence of a new particle undergoing X \u2192 gg decay foresee that the natural width \u0393 X is sizable. Due to the steep decrease of parton distribution functions as a function of Bjorken-x at large x values, the mass distribution of the resonance at particle level assumes a quite non-Gaussian shape, with long tails toward masses much smaller than m X . This peculiarity makes the search for gluon-pair resonances rather different from the search of generic narrow states decaying to jet pairs, and the result of the latter not usable to extract precise information on models predicting gg resonances.",

            "text": "The search reported in [473], which employed 1f b \u22121 of proton-proton luminosity of 7-TeV collisions, was the first ATLAS result considering the S8 model. They scanned with the Bumphunter technique [256,257] the mass distribution for a signal modeled with Madgraph 5 at leading order, interfaced to Pythia with CTEQ6L1 PDFs, with the ATLAS MC09 tune [474] and passed through a full detector simulation. The wider shape of the S8 model clearly impacted the sensitivity of the search, which reported cross section times acceptance limits that were indeed two to 10 times worse than those set on excited quarks in the mass range from 1 to 4 TeV (see Fig. 15, left). The resulting 95% CL lower limit on the mass of colour-octet scalars was set at 1.92 TeV. The study also provided cross section times acceptance limits for generic signals producing a Gaussian mass distribution, assuming that the detector reconstructed the final state with a 4% resolution. In a repetition of the same search, using the full 7 TeV dataset corresponding to 4.8f b \u22121 of integrated luminosity collected in 2011 [475], ATLAS could only report a limit at 1.86 TeV because of a 1-sigma upper fluctuation of the data for masses of about 2 TeV. In that study they also set for the first time 95% CL limits on the mass of string resonances at 3.61 TeV. Successively, using 20.3 f b \u22121 of 8-TeV collisions collected in 2012, AT-LAS could significantly increase the lower limit on the mass of S8 resonances to 2.70 TeV [476]. In that study a more complete treatment of generic dijet mass resonance shapes was also applied, using a non-relativistic approximation of the Breit-Wigner resonance shape convoluted with parton distribution functions, non-perturbative effects, and a Gaussian detector resolution model. The worsening of the sensitivity as the relative width \u0393/m increases was found significant for resonance masses of 2.0 (3.5) TeV, where expected upper limits on the cross section times acceptance increase by a factor of two (ten), respectively. The same generic search was also performed in [477], using data corresponding to 3.6 f b \u22121 of luminosity collected in 2015 at 13-TeV proton-proton collisions, and in [478], which added to that dataset the one collected in 2016, searching in a total luminosity of 37 f b \u22121 of Run 2 collisions. The last study did not set explicit limits on gg-decaying resonances but provided and improved folding procedure of detector and physics effects of the generic search for Gaussian signals. The extraction of precise information on the existence of gg-decaying resonances from those results is however not straightforward. Figure 15: Left: 95% CL upper limit on the product of cross section and acceptance of a colour-octet scalar as a function of the particle mass obtained by ATLAS [473]. The coloured bands indicate the expected range of upper limits at 68% and 95% given the search sensitivity; the points are the actual excluded values. The predicted cross section times acceptance of a S8 colour-octet scalar is also shown as a dashed curve. Right: 95% CL upper limits obtained by the CMS search described in [480]  The CMS collaboration devoted great attention to the study of dijet events, producing a number of searches for high-mass states which could become manifest in that signature. Again, we report here only studies which resulted in the extraction of information on models predicting resonances decaying to gluon pairs. The experiment uses PF objects clustered in \"wide jets\" to perform these searches, as a larger cone radius reduces sensitivity to systematic effects and improves the mass reconstruction; a selection of the data to require a pseudorapidity separation |\u2206\u03b7| < 1.3 between the two jets is also usually applied to reduce QCD backgrounds. The CMS collaboration produced an early search for dijet resonances employing only 2.9 pb \u22121 of 7-TeV proton-proton collisions [479], and a more sensitive result using a larger data sample corresponding to a luminosity of 1 f b \u22121 [480], reporting upper limits on the product of cross section times branching fraction times acceptance for a number of dijet-decaying resonances (see Fig. 15, right). Those searches could not limit the mass range of models predicting new Z or G * resonances decaying to gg pairs; the search however set a lower limit on the string resonance mass at 4.0 TeV. A search later reported in [481] considered 4.0 f b \u22121 of 8-TeV collisions and searched for qq, qg, and gg resonances in the mass range from 1.0 to 4.8 TeV. The data were found to be well described by the four-parameter function",

            "text": "with x = m jj / \u221a s, and upper limits on the strength of the three different resonance shapes were extracted at each mass point with a Bayesian technique [273]. Limits on the mass of a S8 colour-octet scalar were set at 2.79 TeV. For gravitons described by the Randall-Sundrum model, the limit was obtained by considering in the signal-extraction fit a weighted average of the expected signal shape of gg and qq decaying states, to account for the possible decay modes of the searched state; the lower limit was set at 1.45 TeV. The study of [482] considered a luminosity of 12.9 f b \u22121 of 13-TeV proton-proton collisions, extending a previous search [483] on a smaller Run 2 dataset. The search was performed separately in two different mass regions: together with regular high-energy dijet events collected by the HLT system, for which the trigger selection was fully efficient for dijet masses above 1.1 TeV, events were also collected in a separate data path by reconstructing jets online with simplified \"calorimeter-based\" algorithm, and storing only calorimeter information, thus allowing for lower E T thresholds. This way, the low-mass search could extend from 0.6 to 1.6 TeV, while the high-mass search covered the rest of the spectrum up to 7.5 TeV (the highest-mass event had m jj = 7.7 TeV). To test the scalar colour-octet model a value of the squared anomalous coupling k 2 s = 1/2 was used [484]. This implies a reduction of both natural width and cross section by a factor of two with respect to the values assumed in the previous search [483]. The data were observed to be well described by a QCD-inspired four-parameter functional form, as shown in Fig. 16 (left), and limits were set on the mass of resonances for a number of models; in particular, for what concerns gg resonances, 95% CL lower limits on the new particle mass were set at 3.0 TeV for colour-octet scalars. A lower limit on the mass of RS gravitons was also set by considering a 60% branching fraction of the graviton to quark pairs and 40% to gluon pairs; that result excluded the region m * G < 1.9 TeV, again at 95% CL (Fig. 16, right). In the search described in [485] CMS exploited the technique called \"data scouting\" to collect events with hadronic jets at trigger level with a rate of 1 kHz, by storing a reduced amount of information on the online-reconstructed jets subjected to a calibration procedure; this allowed the high-statistics investigation of the mass range from 400 to 1850 GeV, enhancing the sensitivity to resonances with reduced couplings to quarks and gluons. The data corresponded to an integrated luminosity of 18.8 f b \u22121 and were collected at a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV during 2012. The extracted cross section times acceptance limits on narrow resonances decaying to gluon pairs were used to obtain mass limits on RS gravitons, considered as a benchmark. The mass region 500 < m G * < 1000 GeV was excluded by averaging the observed limits for qq and gg resonances, a technique which we stigmatize as improper although in the considered case it is probably a reasonable approximation. Figure 16: Left: Mass distribution of jet pairs from the CMS analysis of data corresponding to 12.9 f b \u22121 of 13-TeV proton-proton collisions reported in [482]. A background-only fit is overimposed to the data; sample signal shapes for gg, qg, and qq resonances of mass respectively of 2.0, 4.0, and 6.0 TeV are also shown. The lower panel shows the data minus fit residuals, normalized by their statistical uncertainty. Right: 95% CL upper limits on the product of cross section times branching fraction times acceptance (\u03c3BA) of resonances decaying to jet pairs, obtained by CMS in the same analysis [482]. The three thick curves refer to qq-, qg-, and gg-decaying resonances; the graph includes the predicted dependence of the product \u03c3BA on resonance mass for a number of considered models. Table 5 offers a summary of the results obtained by the LHC experiments in their searches for resonances decaying to gluon pairs. We omit to report the result of searches for generic Gaussian signals by ATLAS, which we consider not relevant for the gg final state. 7 Summary and Outlook 7.1 Summary of LHC Searches",

The resulting datasets allow the production of a wealth of measurements. Most notably, the Higgs boson was studied in great detail, obtaining cross section measurements in all the main production modes and estimates of the Higgs branching fraction to five different final states, all of which were found in excellent agreement with SM predictions. The Higgs boson mass is now known with a precision of a fraction of a percent, and a vigorous campaign of measurements has started to close in on some of its most detailed properties, like the intrinsic width and the self-coupling constant. In parallel, detailed measurements of other SM observables allowed a qualitative step forward in the area of precision physics. From the viewpoint of experimental studies the standard model is in a quite healthy state, with measurement precisions of O(10 \u22124 ) on the W mass and O(10 \u22123 ) on the top quark and Higgs boson masses still perfectly matching the indirect experimental inputs on electroweak observables produced at the Z pole and in other precision measurements [486].",

The search for those new effects by the LHC experiments has been arguably even more intense than the measurement campaign targeting the Higgs boson or other SM physics, as is testified by the fact that the exotica groups of the two collaborations are the most prolific ones in terms of published results. Yet no anomaly has been detected yet. This dearth of hints that we might ever be getting close to the breaking point of the SM is a sobering input, as the LHC will only be able to increase its center-of-mass energy by 7% in the near future, with a resulting limited increase of parton luminosities for very-high-energy collisions. The discovery potential of new massive states which constitute the most straightforward and cleanest way to detect physics beyond the SM is thus only going to be driven by increases in the total integrated luminosity. As a result, the lack of a first evidence of new effects in those 100 inverse femtobarns of luminosity collected so far guarantees that no new discovery is behind the corner. To this bleak picture one must add the notion that even in case an evidence of something new should appear in the latest analyzed data, consumers of LHC results should be advised to take a wait-and-see attitude rather than starting to produce tentative models that explain the effect in the context of beyond-the-standard-model concoctions. The hundreds of considered final states, the testing of dozens of differential distributions in wide ranges of the relevant variables, and the multiple iteration of the same testing procedures as more data is collected, all together in fact imply that occasional threesigma, and even four-and five-sigma effects due to statistical fluctuations or imperfect assessment of systematic uncertainties are bound to arise sooner or later. A demonstration of this simple observation was given in December 2015 by the appearance of the infamous \"gamma-gamma\" resonance spotted at 750 GeV as a small bump in an otherwise smooth mass distribution of photon pairs by ATLAS and CMS. The resulting explosion of published theoretical models capable of incorporating the diphoton decay of a massive resonance without affecting the observed agreement of other observables with SM predictions is not necessarily nocuous; it has actually been argued to be beneficial for the field [487]; nonetheless, it might also be taken as an advice for the LHC experiments to be even more careful in the presentation of their results.",

Since the signatures to be considered to search for diboson-decaying resonances are not as complex and multiform as those e.g. required to investigate the parameter space of SUSY theories, they enable an economical investigation of multiple theoretical models. The recent approval of the future high-luminosity program of the Large Hadron Collider imply that its experiments studying the high-energy frontier will continue to search for resonant signals in their mass distributions for many years to come.

            "text": "Whatever machine will inherit the LHC leadership at the high-energy frontier, it will highly benefit from the phenomenological and experimental studies and from the analysis techniques that have been developed there over the course of the past decade for the production of results such as those described in this review. We find of particular significance those belonging to five macro-areas of research. The first is the development of new calculational tools that have allowed for more precise predictions of the phenomenology of parton collisions, in particular in complex final states with many hadronic jets. The baseline for most processes is now the next-to-leading order, with many processes computed and modeled to Next-to-Next-to-Leading Order (NNLO), and some even to three-loop accuracy [498]; parton-level MC programs that include those calculations have greatly improved the understanding of experimental data and supported all BSM searches. The second is constituted by statistical methods devised to extract inference on the presence of small localized signals from likelihood fits to smooth mass distributions, when account needs to be taken of a large number of nuisance parameters. The third area, which is undergoing an explosive expansion inside and outside HEP, is the one of machinelearning methods which lend themselves excellently to the challenging classification and regression use cases that are common in particle physics research. The fourth is represented by particle-flow-based reconstruction techniques of high-level objects, which has proven crucial for the precise measurement of hadronic jets in high-pile-up circumstances, as well as for the high-efficiency identification of difficult signatures such as hadronically-decaying \u03c4 leptons. The fifth area includes all procedures that allow the tagging of heavy objects within wide hadronic jets of very high energy, by pruning calorimeter clusters of their soft contributions and extracting information on their origin from their substructure. Guidance on the design requirements of the next generation of particle detectors will come in particular from the latter two macro-areas above, as they call for both very high granularity and redundant detection of energy deposits in the calorimeters, as well as a precise tracking in very strong magnetic fields capable of \"fanning out\" the soft components of hadronic jets.",

No significant departure from the background model was observed, and 95% CL limits were extracted on the cross section of the new particle times its branching fraction to a Z\u03b3 pair. The limits varied between 88 f b and 2.8 f b for spin-0 resonance masses in the 250 -2400 GeV range in the hypothesis of gluon fusion production, and from 117 (94) f b to 3.7 (2.3) f b for a spin-2 resonance produced via gluon-gluon fusion (respectively quark-antiquark annihilation).",
