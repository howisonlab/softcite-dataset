The full data set recorded by the CMS experiment during the LHC run 1 is used, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of up to 5.1 fb \u22121 at a center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV and up to 19.7 fb \u22121 at 8 TeV. A wide range of spin-two models is excluded at a 99% confidence level or higher, or at a 99.87% confidence level for the minimal gravitylike couplings, regardless of whether assumptions are made on the production mechanism. Any mixed-parity spin-one state is excluded in the ZZ and WW modes at a greater than 99.999% confidence level. Under the hypothesis that the resonance is a spin-zero boson, the tensor structure of the interactions of the Higgs boson with two vector bosons ZZ, Z\u03b3, \u03b3\u03b3, and WW is investigated and limits on eleven anomalous contributions are set. Tighter constraints on anomalous HVV interactions are obtained by combining the HZZ and HWW measurements. All observations are consistent with the expectations for the standard model Higgs boson with the quantum numbers J PC \u00bc 0 \u00fe\u00fe .",

The results showed that the spin-parity properties of the new boson are consistent with the expectations for the scalar SM Higgs boson. In particular, the hypotheses of a pseudoscalar, vector, and pseudovector boson were excluded at a 99.95% confidence level (CL) or higher, and several spin-two boson hypotheses were excluded at a 98% C.L. or higher. The investigated spin-two models included two bosons with gravitonlike interactions and two bosons with higherdimension operators and opposite parity. The spin-zero results included the first constraint of the f a3 parameter, which probes the tensor structure of the HZZ interactions and is defined as the fractional pseudoscalar cross section, with f a3 \u00bc 1 corresponding to the pure pseudoscalar hypothesis. The ATLAS experiment has also excluded at a 98% C.L. or higher the hypotheses of a pseudoscalar, vector, pseudovector, and graviton-inspired spin-two boson with minimal couplings and several assumptions on the boson production mechanisms [22].",

The study focuses on testing for the presence of anomalous effects in HZZ and HWW interactions under spin-zero, -one, and -two hypotheses. The HZ\u03b3 and H\u03b3\u03b3 interactions are probed for the first time using the 4l final state. Constraints are set on eleven anomalous coupling contributions to the HVV interactions, where V is a gauge vector boson, under the spin-zero assumption of the Higgs boson, extending the original measurement of the f a3 parameter [11,12]. The exotic-spin study is extended to the analysis of mixed spin-one states, beyond the pure parity states studied earlier [12,14], and ten spin-two hypotheses of the boson under the assumption of production either via gluon fusion or quark-antiquark annihilation, or without such an assumption. This corresponds to thirty spin-two models, beyond the six production and decay models studied earlier [11,12,14]. The H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 decay channel is also studied in the context of exotic spin-two scenarios, and the results presented in Ref. [15] are combined with those obtained in the H \u2192 ZZ and H \u2192 WW channels [12,14].",

The analysis is based on theoretical and phenomenological studies that describe the couplings of a Higgs-like boson to two gauge bosons. They provide techniques and ideas for measuring the spin and CP properties of a particle interacting with vector bosons . Historically, such techniques have been applied to the analysis of meson decays to four-body final states [58][59][60][61][62].",

In the following, the spin-parity state is generically denoted as J P , with J \u00bc 0; 1, or 2, while the quantum numbers of the SM Higgs boson are expected to be J PC \u00bc 0 \u00fe\u00fe .

In gluon fusion, about 10% of H \u2192 ZZ and H \u2192 WW events are produced off-shell, with a Higgs boson invariant mass above 150 GeV [72]. A similar effect appears in VBF production [13], while it is further suppressed for other production mechanisms. However, this off-shell contribution depends on the width of the Higgs boson [73]. A relative enhancement of the off-shell with respect to the on-shell production is expected in models with anomalous HVV couplings [13,57]. Therefore, it is possible to study anomalous HVV interactions using the kinematics of the Higgs boson produced off-shell, including relative off-shell enhancement. However, such a study requires additional assumptions about the width of the Higgs boson, its production mechanisms, and the extrapolation of the coupling constants in Eqs. 1, (8), and (11) to q 2 H values significantly larger than 100 GeV. Therefore, the study of anomalous HVV couplings with the off-shell Higgs boson is left for a future work. Instead, the H \u2192 ZZ events with an invariant ZZ mass above 140 GeV are not considered, effectively removing off-shell effects and associated model dependence. In the H \u2192 WW analysis, the event selection discussed below reduces the off-shell contribution to less than 2%. Even though this contribution may increase with anomalous HVV couplings, no such enhancement has been observed in the H \u2192 ZZ study [13], which limits it to be less than 5 times the SM expectation at a 95% C.L. This constraint is expected to be further improved with more data and additional final states studied. In the present analysis, any off-shell contribution in the study of the on-shell production and H \u2192 WW decay is neglected.",

It is also found that the NLO QCD effects that are relevant for the analysis of a spin-zero state are well approximated with the combination of leading-order (LO) QCD matrix elements and parton showering [31]. Therefore, JHUGEN at LO QCD is adopted for the simulation of anomalous interactions in all the other production processes where it is important to model the correlations between production and the kinematics of the final-state particles, such as in VBF and VH production of a spin-zero state, qq \u2192 X production of a spin-one state, and qq and gg \u2192 X production of a spin-two state. In the case of a spin-two X boson, the LO QCD modeling of production avoids a potentially problematic p T spectrum of the X boson appearing at NLO with nonuniversal Xqq and Xgg couplings [54] allowed in this study. In all cases, the decays H=X \u2192 ZZ=Z\u03b3 \u00c3 =\u03b3 \u00c3 \u03b3 \u00c3 \u2192 4l, H=X \u2192 WW \u2192 l\u03bdl\u03bd, and H=X \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 are simulated with JHUGEN, including all spin correlations in the production and decay processes and interference effects between all contributing amplitudes.",

The e\u03bc pair is required to have an invariant mass above 12 GeV, and a p T above 30 GeV. Events are also required to have projected E miss T above 20 GeV, as defined in Ref. [14].",

The selection requires a loose calorimetric identification based on the shape of the electromagnetic shower and loose isolation requirements on the photon candidates. For the spin-parity studies, the \"cut-based\" analysis described in Ref. [15] is used. This analysis does not use multivariate techniques for selection or classification of events, which allows for a categorization better suited for the study of the Higgs boson decay kinematics. The cosine of the scattering angle in the Collins-Soper frame, cos \u03b8 \u00c3 , is used to discriminate between the spin hypotheses. The angle is defined in the diphoton rest frame as that between the collinear photons and the line that bisects the acute angle between the colliding protons. To increase the sensitivity, the events are categorized using the same four diphoton event classes used in the cut-based analysis but without the additional classification based on p T used there. Within each diphoton class, the events are binned in j cos \u03b8 \u00c3 j to discriminate between the different spin hypotheses. The events are thus split into 20 event classes, four \u00f0\u03b7; R 9 \u00de [15] diphoton classes with five j cos \u03b8 \u00c3 j bins each, for both the 7 and 8 TeV data sets, giving a total of 40 event classes. In Table V, the number of estimated background and signal events and the number of observed candidates are given after the final selection in an m \u03b3\u03b3 range centered at m H \u00bc 125 GeV and corresponding to the full width at half maximum for the signal distribution for each of the four \u00f0\u03b7; R 9 \u00de categories.

As a result, a nontrivial correlation of the kinematic distributions of production and sequential decay is observed for a resonance with nonzero spin, while there is no such direct correlation due to polarization for a spin-zero resonance. Furthermore, the kinematics and polarization of the vector bosons in the H \u2192 VV process depend on the initial polarization of the resonance and the tensor structure of the HVV interactions, and this affects the kinematics of the leptons in the VV \u2192 4l or l\u03bdl\u03bd decay. The analysis of the HVV interactions requires the study of the kinematic distributions of the Higgs boson decay products compared to the prediction of the corresponding models. In the case of the H \u2192 VV \u2192 4l decay, the full kinematic information can be reconstructed with small experimental uncertainties. In the case of the H \u2192 WW \u2192 l\u03bdl\u03bd decay, the two missing neutrinos lead to a loss of kinematic information, but in some cases the V-A nature of the W \u2192 l\u03bd coupling, compared to a different V-A coupling in the Z \u2192 ll decay, leads to more pronounced kinematic effects.

Its goal is to reduce the number of observables to be manageable in the following analysis, while retaining full information for the measurements of interest. A maximum likelihood fit employs the template parametrization of the probability distribution of the kinematic observables using full simulation of the processes in the detector. This method is validated with the analytic parametrization of some of the multidimensional distributions using a simplified modeling of the detector response in the H \u2192 ZZ \u2192 4l channel.

The observables with their correlations are used in the analysis to establish the consistency of the spin and parity quantum numbers and tensor structure of interactions with respect to the SM predictions.

            "text": "A comprehensive analysis of the kinematics of the decay of a Higgs boson would include up to eight observables, as discussed above. In such an analysis, it is required to have a parametrization of the multidimensional distributions as a function of the parameters of interest. However, it becomes challenging to describe all the correlations of the observables and detector effects. It is possible to reduce the number of observables and keep the necessary information using the matrix element likelihood approach. In this approach, the kinematic information is stored in a discriminant designed for the separation of either background, the alternative signal components, or interference between those components. The parametrization of up to three observables can be performed with full simulation or data from the control regions. This approach is adopted in the H \u2192 VV \u2192 4l analysis. A similar approach is also possible in the H \u2192 WW \u2192 l\u03bdl\u03bd channel, but the construction of the discriminants is more challenging because of the presence of unobserved neutrinos. Therefore, a simpler approach with the two observables defined above is used in this case. The use of kinematic discriminants in Higgs boson studies was introduced in previous CMS analyses [2,[11][12][13] and feasibility studies [29,31], and here it is extended both to a number of new models and to new techniques. The construction of the kinematic discriminants follows the matrix element likelihood approach, where the probabilities for an event are calculated using the LO matrix elements as a function of angular and mass observables. In this way, the kinematic information, which fully characterizes the 4l event topology of a certain process in its center-of-mass frame, is condensed to a reduced number of observables.",

The probabilities P int J P parametrize interference between contributions from the SM and anomalous couplings, where J P refers to a spin-zero tensor structure of interest, and they are allowed to have both positive and negative values. In the calculation of the mixed amplitude used for P kin SM\u00feJ P , the same coupling strengths are used as in the individual probabilities P kin SM and P kin J P , and these couplings are required to provide equal cross sections for the two individual processes. The quantity P int\u22a5 J P is constructed in the same way as P int J P except that the phase of the J P amplitude is changed by \u03c0=2. The matrix element calculations in Eq. 17are also used for the reweighting of simulated samples, as discussed in Sec. III.",

Both approaches are found to give consistent expected results and unbiased parameter estimates in the fit for anomalous couplings for the full spectrum of measurements listed in Table VI. These tests rely on the proper simulation of the signal and background processes, and further studies propagate any systematic uncertainties in the simulation to the final results, which are specific to each final state.

The shape uncertainty is taken into account by considering the difference between the Z \u00fe X and qq \u2192 ZZ distributions for a particular final state, which was found to cover any potential biases in Z \u00fe X parametrization.

For the measurements presented in Sec.

The transfer functions are constructed from the fully simulated samples for both signal and background. Because of the excellent angular resolution of the CMS tracker, for the purpose of this measurement, the effect of the resolution on the direction of each lepton is negligible compared with the effect of the momentum resolution. As a result, the effect of the direction is neglected, and only the p T response of the leptons is modeled. It is also assumed that the detector response for each lepton is independent of the other leptons so that the transfer function can be written as a product of the transfer functions for each individual lepton. Furthermore, an overall efficiency factor to account for inefficiencies in the lepton selection requirements is applied. The transfer functions are validated by comparing the full detector simulation with the generator-level samples, where track parameters are convolved with these functions.",

Instead, the likelihood is calculated by filling a multidimensional template histogram using very large samples of generator-level PYTHIA and MCFM events, respectively, with parton showering modeled by PYTHIA. These samples are smeared with transfer functions to account for detector effects. This approach is validated using the qq \u2192 ZZ=Z\u03b3 \u00c3 analytic description and the corresponding templates, which have been confirmed to have a sufficient accuracy for the description of these backgrounds. The remaining discrepancies observed between the Z \u00fe X background templates and the control regions used in the template analysis [12] are covered by assigning a corresponding systematic uncertainty. The systematic uncertainties in the lepton momentum scale and resolution are propagated using alternative parametrizations generated through variations of the transfer function for both signal and background. The sizes of these variations were determined to be consistent with the size of the lepton momentum and resolution systematic uncertainty in Ref. [12]. A systematic uncertainty in the production spectrum of the signal is included using variation of the p T spectrum of the four-lepton system when averaging over the production spectrum.

Mixed spin-one state hypotheses, as well as the spin-two models listed in Table VI, are examined. In addition, the fractional presence of J P models of a state nearly degenerate in mass with the SM state are tested. In all cases, the template method is employed as discussed in Sec. IV D. The X \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 decay channel is also studied in the context of the exotic spin-two scenarios, and the results presented in Ref. [15] are combined with those obtained in the X \u2192 ZZ and WW channels [12,14]. All spin-one and spin-two scenarios studied are excluded, which motivates the detailed study of the spin-zero scenario in Sec. VI. All studies in this paper are presented under the hypothesis of a boson mass of m H \u00bc 125.6 GeV, which is the combined value in the H \u2192 ZZ and WW channels [12,14]. The only exception is the analysis of the X \u2192 ZZ, WW, and \u03b3\u03b3 channels combined that is performed with the m H \u00bc 125.0 GeV hypothesis, which is the combined value for the three channels [12,14,15].

The input observables are \u00f0D bkg ; D 1 \u2212 ; D 1 \u00fe \u00de. It has been demonstrated in the context of this study that the distributions of these observables are not sensitive to the phase between the b 1 and b 2 coupling parameters in Eq. 8, and therefore the results of the f b2 scan are valid for any value of the phase term in the interference. The spin-one hypothesis is tested for two scenarios, qq production and using only decay information. The latter requires the input observables \u00f0D dec bkg ; D dec 1 \u2212 ; D dec 1 \u00fe \u00de. Figure 5 (left) shows the distribution of the test statistic q \u00bc \u22122 ln\u00f0L J P =L 0 \u00fe \u00de for a SM Higgs boson and for the J P \u00bc 1 \u00fe hypothesis. The expected and observed separations of spin-one models from the test statistic distributions are summarized in Table VII and in Fig. 6. The expected separation between the alternative signal hypotheses is quoted for two cases. In the first case, the expected SM Higgs boson signal strength and the alternative signal cross section are the ones obtained in the fit to the data. The second case assumes the nominal SM Higgs boson signal strength (defined as \u03bc \u00bc 1), while the cross section for the alternative signal hypothesis is taken to be the same as for the SM Higgs boson (the 2e2\u03bc channel at 8 TeV is taken as a reference). Since the observed signal strength is very close to unity, the two results for the expected separations are also similar. Figure 5 (right) also shows an example of the likelihood scan, \u22122\u0394 ln L, as a function of f\u00f0J P \u00de for the qq produced 1 \u00fe model, where the fractional cross section of a second overlapping but noninterfering resonance f\u00f0J P \u00de is defined in Eq.

The ratio \u00f02=a 1 \u00de 2 scales this measurement with respect to the H \u2192 ZZ coupling and is expected to be 1.0 in the SM. As can be seen in Table XVII, the constraints presented on these ratios (<170 for ja Z\u03b3 2 j or <730 for ja \u03b3\u03b3 2 j at 95% C.L.) are about 1 or 3 orders of magnitude higher than from the analyses of the direct H \u2192 Z\u03b3 (\u03bc < 9.5 at 95% C.L.

Therefore, the constraints presented on f Z\u03b3 a2 , f Z\u03b3 a3 , f \u03b3\u03b3 a2 , f \u03b3\u03b3 a3 are not competitive compared with the direct cross-section measurements in H \u2192 Z\u03b3 or \u03b3\u03b3 decays. However, eventually with sufficiently large integrated luminosity, it might be possible to measure f V\u03b3 a2 and f V\u03b3 a3 separately in the H \u2192 VV \u2192 4l decay, allowing for measurements of the CP properties in these couplings [56,64]. The H \u2192 Z\u03b3 or \u03b3\u03b3 measurements with on-shell photons are sensitive only to the sum of the two crosssection fractions f V\u03b3 a2 and f V\u03b3 a3 and therefore cannot distinguish the two. Moreover, the f Z\u03b3 \u039b1 measurement is not possible with on-shell photons.",

This yield relationship is possible if either the fraction of VBF and VH production is known or reconstruction efficiency for these and gluon fusion production mechanisms is the same.

The fraction of VBF and VH production has been found to be small and consistent with the SM expectation of 12% [21]. However, this constraint is performed under the assumption of the SM kinematics of associated particles. While it is possible to obtain similar constraints on associated Higgs boson production with anomalous couplings, that analysis is beyond the scope of this paper. Therefore, we assume that the gluon fusion production dominates and the fraction of VBF and VH production is not larger than expected in the SM. This leads to potential uncertainty on the yield relationship of about 3%, which we neglect.
