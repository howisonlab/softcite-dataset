            "text": "Neutrino oscillations indicate that at least two of the known neutrinos are massive, requiring the original Standard Model to be expanded. The existence of additional heavy neutrinos (mostly sterile, without direct coupling in weak interactions) is still an open question. A wide range of motivations [1] for sterile neutrinos come from cosmological and astrophysical arguments of baryoge-nesis [2], large scale structure formation [3] and big bang nucleosynthesis [4], and from the tension in the Hubble constant [5]. In the Neutrino Minimal Standard Model (\u03bdMSM) three sterile neutrinos are introduced which include a stable dark matter candidate [6]. MeV neutrinos could be accommodated in the \u03bdMSM to explain the 7 Li abundance [7] or, with the addition of a MeV scalar, to obtain consistent results for anomalies in neutrino experiments [8]. In many scenarios, the mass scale of sterile neutrinos is not constrained to be light [9,10], opening up many possibilities and potential observables in particle physics, astrophysics and cosmology.",

[11] measured the kinetic energy of muons from the decay \u03c0 + \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bd (kinetic energy T \u03bc = 4.1 MeV for a massless neutrino), and searched for low-energy peaks due to heavy neutrinos. Upper limits on |U \u03bci | 2 for the 5-30 MeV/c 2 region were set at a level of 10 \u22122 -10 \u22125 ; the experiment was limited by accidental background. Heavy neutrinos in the mass region 30-33.9 MeV/c 2 were also sought in pion decay by Bryman and Numao [12], providing upper limits of 10 \u22123 -10 \u22124 ; this search was limited by background coming from pion decays in flight (\u03c0 DIF). Daum et al. [13] employed a similar technique but with excellent energy resolution (\u223c 10 keV) using a Germanium detector; the search region was 1-20 MeV/c 2 with a sensitivity level of 10 \u22125 , which was limited by statistics. A dedicated magnetic spectrometer experiment [14]  When a pion is stopped in a thick plastic scintillator all decay vertices are contained; the first signal is from the kinetic energy of the incident beam pion, the second from the muon in \u03c0 + \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bd decay, and the third from the positron in \u03bc + \u2192 e + \u03bd\u03bd decay (\u03c0 + \u2192 \u03bc + \u2192 e + decay); the positron usually escapes in the case considered here. In the present study, the leading backgrounds arising from accidental particles and \u03c0 DIF were suppressed using waveform and tracking information to identify extra activity in the detector system, and the statistics were improved by an order of magnitude over previous experiments.",
