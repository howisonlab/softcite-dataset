This is the first time a cryogenic receiver has been used in the search for HP-CDM. Such use helps reduce thermal noise. We recorded data for 9.3 hours using an effective aperture area of 14.8 cm 2 . No signal was found in the data. We set upper limits for the parameter of mixing between the photon and HP-CDM in the mass range from 115.79 to 115.85 \u00b5eV, \u03c7 < 1.8-4.3 \u00d7 10 \u221210 , at a 95% confidence level. This is the most stringent upper limit obtained to date in the considered mass range.",

We understand that the gravity of galaxies is dominated by CDM. However, we do not know whether CDM interacts with standard-model particles except through gravity. A weakly interacting massive particle is a popular candidate of CDM, and it is expected to have heavy mass (more than a GeV in typical models). Many experiments have made efforts towards its detection. However, there has not yet been any conclusive result [1][2][3][4][5][6]. In recent years, another theoretical candidate, the weakly interacting slim particle, has been suggested. The weakly interacting slim particle is expected to have a very small mass [7,8]. The hidden photon (HP) is a candidate weakly interacting slim particle and is a U(1) gauge boson that kinetically mixes with ordinary photons [9]. The effective Lagrangian in this model is",

The HP as CDM (hereafter HP-CDM) has been searched for via the kinetic mixing term (i.e., the third term in the above equation). Thus far, experiments conducted using cavities have given strong upper limits at a mass below 20 \u00b5eV [10]. A methodology of searching for HP-CDM in the higher mass region has been suggested [11]. Kinetic mixing converts HP-CDM into the electromagnetic waves (i.e., photons) at the surface of a metal plate. The frequency of the conversion photon (\u03bd 0 ) represents the mass of the HP (m \u03b3 ),",

We validate the analysis procedure adopting a \"null sample\" method. We randomly divide the calibrated data for each run into two data sets, and we create subtracted data samples for each region (named null samples). No signal is contained in a null sample because signals in each data set cancel out. We check whether the mean value of the fitting results for null samples (P \u03b3 null ) is consistent with a value of zero. We also check for analysis bias between the fitting error (\u2206P \u03b3 null ) and a standard deviation of fitting results. Figure 5 shows the distribution of P \u03b3 null /\u2206P \u03b3 null .

However, we understand that the error used in the signal extraction should be corrected using a multiplication factor of 1.12.

This efficiency loss is . Systematic uncertainty in A eff is determined by the calibration error described in section 4. We understand that the receiver gain is stable compared with the uncertainty in CDM density (7.7%) as described in section 4. The frequency stability is examined using a vector network analyzer (VNA, Agilent, N5224A) as a microwave source. The VNA generates a monochrome wave with a frequency of 28.003 GHz, and the signal analyzer measures the wave. We confirm that the fluctuation of the frequency peak position is below 1 kHz even if we change the temperature of the signal analyzer from 27.8 \u2022 C to 40.3 \u2022 C. This effect corresponds to a tiny efficiency loss of 0.9%. A possible fitting bias due to the frequency bin is estimated using the Monte Carlo simulation: 4.8%. The total systematic uncertainty is assigned to be 11.3% for signal detection. Figure 6 shows the extracted power (P \u03b3 ) and statistical error (\u2206P \u03b3 ) as functions of frequency. Local p-values, (1 \u2212 erf(P \u03b3 /\u2206P \u03b3 / \u221a 2))/2, are also shown.

We determine the number of independent frequency windows (1.0 \u00d7 10 3 ) by conducting Monte Carlo simulations. The probability of exceeding p min in any frequency bin is estimated as 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 p min ) 1.0 \u00d7 10 3 = 0.12 (1.2\u03c3).",
