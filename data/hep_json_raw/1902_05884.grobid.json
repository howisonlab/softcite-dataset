The measurement is based on a sample of pp-collision data, collected at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV with the LHCb detector and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2 fb \u22121 . The amplitude analysis of this decay is performed with the isobar model and a phenomenological model based on an effective chiral Lagrangian. In both models the S-wave component in the K \u2212 K + system is dominant, with a small contribution of the \u03c6(1020) meson and a negligible contribution from tensor resonances. The K + K \u2212 scattering amplitudes for the considered combinations of spin (0,1) and isospin (0,1) of the two-body system are obtained from the Dalitz plot fit with the phenomenological decay amplitude.",

            "text": "The theoretical treatment of weak decays of charm mesons is very challenging. The charm quark is not light enough for the reliable application of chiral perturbation theory, which is successfully applied in predictions of kaon decays. The charm quark is also not heavy enough for the reliable application of the factorisation approach and heavy-quark expansion tools, as used in predictions of properties of b hadrons. The description of charm meson decays relies on approximate symmetries and phenomenological models. For such models, the knowledge of branching fractions and the resonant structures, in the case of multi-body JHEP04(2019)063 decays, are key inputs. In this paper, the first determination of the resonant structure of the doubly Cabibbo-suppressed decay D + \u2192 K \u2212 K + K + is presented. 1 The analysis is based on a data sample of pp collisions collected with the LHCb detector, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2 fb \u22121 at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV. The determination of the resonant structure of this decay is complementary to the recent LHCb measurement of its branching fraction [1], based on the same data set.",

Most information currently available on \u03c0\u03c0 and K\u03c0 scattering is obtained indirectly from meson-nucleon interactions [4][5][6]. In the regime where the momentum transferred to the nucleon is small enough, the interaction is assumed to be dominated by the one-pion-exchange amplitude. The asymptotically free incoming meson interacts with a virtual pion, resulting in what is generally referred as \u03c0\u03c0 and K\u03c0 scattering data. The resulting \u03c0\u03c0 \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0 and K\u03c0 \u2192 K\u03c0 phase shifts are affected by ambiguities and large systematic uncertainties.

Large data sets from the B-factories and LHCb exist for these decays. However, it is necessary to isolate the physics of two-body systems from the rich dynamics of three-body decays, which involve the weak decay of the c quark, the formation of the mesons and their FSI. This is achieved with the Triple-M decay amplitude, in which these three stages are included. The FSI are described in terms of the K + K \u2212 scattering amplitudes for the considered spin-isospin combinations, allowing the determination of these amplitudes from a fit to the D + \u2192 K \u2212 K + K + Dalitz plot.",

As the f 0 (1370) state has large uncertainties on its mass and width [23], these parameters are allowed to float in the fit. Its contribution can also be interpreted, within the isobar formalism, as an effective representation for the overlap of two or more broad structures at high K \u2212 K + invariant mass. Further addition of scalar states does not improve the fit quality significantly, creates more complex interference effects, and provides a very similar description of the lineshape and phase behaviour of the total S-wave. For example, in model B, a constant nonresonant contribution is added to the resonant amplitudes of model A. The resulting fit quality is essentially unchanged, with the total \u03c7 2 /ndof being 1.15 and 1.14 for models A and B, respectively. A similar situation occurs in model C, which has the same amplitudes as in model B plus the a 0 (980)K + component. In this model, the contribution of the f 0 (1370) is found to be negligible and the value of \u03c7 2 /ndof is 1.16. Table 1 summarizes the fit results for these three models. The total S-wave fit fraction includes the interference terms between the various S-wave components. In all cases, the total S-wave in the K + K \u2212 system is dominant, a notable feature also observed in other three-body D decays with a pair of identical particles in the final state, such as the D + \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + and D + (s) \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + decays [23]. The contribution from the f 2 (1270)K + component is also tested and found to be consistent with zero in all models.  Since model A is the simplest model describing all the general features of the observed Dalitz plot distribution, it is chosen as the baseline result for the fit with the isobar model. The projections of the Dalitz plot, with the model A fit result overlaid, are shown in figure 6. The green dashed line represents the phase-space distribution, weighted by the efficiency, evidencing the presence of at least one broad, scalar contribution not consistent with a uniform distribution. The squared modulus and phase of the S-wave amplitude from model A are shown in figure 8 as a function of the K + K \u2212 mass, with total uncertainties represented as bands. For comparison, the corresponding central results for models B and C are overlaid.

They are summarized in tables 5 and 6, respectively. There is an additional source of systematic uncertainties on the results of the fit with the isobar model due to the uncertainties on the parameters defining the f 0 (980) lineshape, which are fixed in the fit. This additional uncertainty, quoted separately from the experimental uncertainties, is estimated by repeating the fit varying the parameters g \u03c0 , g K and m 0 of eq. (A.4) by one standard deviation, one at a time, and taking the largest deviation as the systematic uncertainty. The radii of the Blatt-Weisskopf form factors are also fixed in the fit.

The tested values of the radii are 4 and 6 GeV \u22121 , for F L D , and 1 and 3 GeV \u22121 , for F L R . Since no significant deviation from the baseline fit is observed, no systematic uncertainty is assigned. Two types of systematic uncertainties due to the background are investigated. First, the background level is varied according to the uncertainty from the fit to the K \u2212 K + K + invariant mass. The data is fitted changing the fraction of the background by \u00b11\u03c3.

The background model is built from inspection of the sidebands of the D + \u2192 K \u2212 K + K + signal. It is a combination of a peaking structure and a smooth component. The smooth component corresponds to 80% of the background and is modelled by a sum of a constant term and an f 0 (980)K + contribution, in equal proportions. A systematic uncertainty due to the modelling of the background is assigned by varying the relative fractions of these two components, fitting the data with these alternative background models and taking the largest variation as systematic uncertainty.",

            "text": "In this paper, the first Dalitz plot analysis of the doubly Cabibbo-suppressed decay D + \u2192 K \u2212 K + K + is performed. The two goals of the analysis are the determinations of the resonant structure of the decay and the K + K \u2212 scattering amplitudes. The resonant structure is studied with two different approaches. In the fit with the isobar model, several variations of the decay amplitude are tested. The Dalitz plot analysis is also performed with the Triple-M [3], which is a model derived from a chiral effective Lagrangian. The Triple-M amplitude has a nonresonant component plus the minimal SU(3) content corresponding to four states, the \u03c6(1020), the a 0 (980) and two isoscalar states, identified with the f 0 (980) and f 0 (1370) resonances. A good description of the data is achieved with both approaches. The resonant structure of the D + \u2192 K \u2212 K + K + is largely dominated by the S-wave, with a approximately 7% contribution from the \u03c6(1020)K + component. The dominance of the S-wave contribution is also observed in other three-body D + (s) decays with a pair of identical particles in the final state, such as the D + \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + and D + (s) \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + decays [23]. The possibility of determining the individual components of the S-wave, however, is limited by the lack of structures in the Dalitz plot, other than that from the \u03c6(1020) resonance, and by the fact that the f 0 (980) and a 0 (980) mesons poles lie below the K + K \u2212 threshold. In all the models tested, large interference between the various S-wave components is observed. In the fit with isobar model, different combinations of scalar resonances and nonresonant amplitudes yield fits of same quality and a very similar S-wave amplitude. In the fit with the Triple-M, a large a 0 (980) contribution is observed, with a large destructive interference with the f 0 (980) component that yields an S-wave fraction of about 94%. The separation between the f 0 (980) and a 0 (980) contributions could better achieved with a simultaneous analyses of the D + \u2192 K \u2212 K + K + , D + \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + and D + \u2192 \u03b7\u03c0 + \u03c0 0 decays.",

The form factors F L D and F L R , for the D + and the resonance decay, respectively, are parameterized by the Blatt-Weisskopf penetration factors [26], and depend on L, the orbital angular momentum involved in the transition. Since both the initial state (the D + meson) and the final state (three kaons) have spin 0, L is equal to the spin of the resonance. In the rest frame of a resonance formed by particles 1 and 2, R 12 , q is the modulus of the momentum of particle 1 or 2 (the decay momentum), q 0 is the decay momentum when s 12 = m 2 R (m R being the nominal resonance mass), and d is a measure of the effective radius of the decaying meson, fixed in this work to 5.0 GeV \u22121 for the D meson and 1.5 GeV \u22121 for the resonance. Defining z = (qd) 2 and z 0 = (q 0 d) 2 , the Blatt-Weisskopf barrier factors are usually written with two different formulations, F L and F L [23], given in table 7. The F L formulation is used in this analysis, consistent with the energy dependent width given below in eq.
