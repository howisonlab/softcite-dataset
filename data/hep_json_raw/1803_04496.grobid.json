            "text": "Proton-proton collisions at the LHC provide for the first time the conditions to study the production of particles with masses at the electroweak scale via photon-photon fusion [1,2]. Although the production of high-mass systems in photon-photon collisions has been observed by the CMS and ATLAS experiments [3][4][5], no such measurement exists so far with the simultaneous detection of the scattered protons. This paper reports the measurement of the process pp \u2192 p + \u2212 p ( * ) in pp collisions at \u221a s = 13 TeV, where a pair of leptons ( = e, \u00b5) with mass m( + \u2212 ) > 110 GeV is reconstructed in the central CMS apparatus, one of the protons is detected in the CMS-TOTEM precision proton spectrometer (CT-PPS), and the second proton either remains intact or is excited and then dissociates into Figure 1. Production of lepton pairs by \u03b3\u03b3 fusion. The exclusive (left), single proton dissociation or semiexclusive (middle), and double proton dissociation (right) topologies are shown. The left and middle processes result in at least one intact final-state proton, and are considered signal in this analysis. The rightmost diagram is considered to be a background process. a low-mass state, indicated by the symbol p * , and escapes undetected. Such a final state receives contributions from exclusive, pp \u2192 p + \u2212 p, and semiexclusive, pp \u2192 p + \u2212 p * , processes (figure 1 left, and center). Central exclusive dilepton production is interesting because deviations from the theoretically well-known cross section may be an indication of new physics [6][7][8], whereas central semiexclusive processes constitute a background to the exclusive reaction when the final-state protons are not measured.",

The left and center diagrams result in at least one intact final-state proton, and are considered as signal in this analysis. The CT-PPS acceptance for detecting both protons in \"exclusive\" pp \u2192 p + \u2212 p events (the left diagram) starts only above m( + \u2212 ) \u2248 400 GeV, where the standard model cross section is small. By selecting events with only a single tagged proton, the sample contains a mixture of lower mass exclusive and single-dissociation (pp \u2192 p + \u2212 p * , \"semiexclusive\") processes with higher cross sections. The right diagram of figure 1 is considered background, and contributes if a proton from the diffractive dissociation is detected, or if a particle detected in CT-PPS from another interaction in the same bunch crossing (pileup), or from beam-induced background is wrongly associated with the dilepton system. A pair of leptons from a Drell-Yan process can also mimic a signal event if detected in combination with a pileup proton.",

The pots as well as the sensors have been extensively used by the TOTEM experiment and are described in refs. [16,19]. The TOTEM silicon strip sensors were not designed to sustain exposure to the high radiation doses of the standard high-luminosity LHC fills. As expected, a first set of such planes suffered severe radiation damage after about 10 fb \u22121 , and was replaced by a set of spares. In order to operate at high instantaneous luminosity, the RPs have been equipped with special ferrite shielding, so as to reduce their electromagnetic impedance, and hence limit their impact on the LHC beams. The timing detectors are housed in low-impedance, cylindrical RPs specially built for CT-PPS, located at 215.7 m from the IP. They were equipped with diamond detectors for the last part of the run to complement the tracking silicon strip detectors. They are not used for the analysis discussed here. In its final configuration, CT-PPS will use 3D silicon pixel sensors for tracking and diamond sensors for timing.",

The search is performed independently in each of the two strip orientations (with angles of +45 \u2022 and \u221245 \u2022 with respect to the bottom of the RP); hits in at least 3 out of 5 planes are required.

Figure 7 shows a typical distribution of the track impact points in the (x, y) plane for a RP at 15 \u03c3 from the beam. When there is more than one pattern in any strip orientation, a unique association is not possible and no track is reconstructed. The inefficiency due to multiple tracks depends on the pileup, and ranges between 15 and 40% in the 2016 data used in this analysis.

The event is accepted if no additional tracks are found in the region within the veto distance around the dilepton vertex. No explicit requirement is made on the p T or on the quality of these extra tracks. In addition, the dilepton acoplanarity (a = 1 \u2212 |\u2206\u03c6( + \u2212 )|/\u03c0) is required to be consistent with the two leptons being back-to-back in azimuth \u03c6. The dilepton acoplanarity versus the distance between the closest extra track and the dilepton vertex is shown in figure 8 for muons (left) and electrons (right), for the simulated signal (blue and green dots) and double-dissociation and Drell-Yan backgrounds (red and yellow dots). Based on these distributions, an extra-track veto region distance of at least 0.5 mm around the vertex is required, along with a < 0.009 for the muons and a < 0.006 for the electrons. The acoplanarity requirements are chosen such that the signal to background ratio predicted by the simulation is above unity before any matching of the leptons with RP tracks. The size of the extra-track veto region is smaller than suggested by the simulation, reflecting the fact that the distribution of primary vertices in z is narrower in the data than in the simulation. Because of the high pileup rate, the selection is based on information from reconstructed tracks alone, without using information from the calorimeters. This results JHEP07 2018  Figure 8.

This suppresses the region around the Z boson mass, which is expected to be dominated by Drell-Yan production. Figure 9 shows the distributions of the dimuon and dielectron invariant mass and rapidity y, after all the central detector requirements just described are applied. The Monte Carlo (MC) predictions are normalized to the total integrated luminosity. In addition, for the lpair predictions, rapidity gap survival probabilities of 0.89, 0.76, and 0.13 are applied to the exclusive, the single dissociative, and the double dissociative processes, respectively. The rapidity gap survival probability quantifies the fraction of events in which no extra soft interactions occur between the colliding protons. These soft interactions produce extra final-state particles, and thereby suppress the visible (semi)exclusive cross section. The values used are calculated from modified photon parton distribution functions in the proton that are compatible with Run 1 LHC measurements. In the case of the proton dissociation processes, these values represent a mix of the incoherent and QCD evolution terms calculated in ref. [37]. This choice of rapidity gap survival probabilities leads to a fair description of the data for y around zero, but overestimates the results at more forward/backward rapidities, as is clear from the bottom panels of figure 9. A y dependence of the rapidity gap survival probability is expected in several models [38,39].",

The formula is exact for exclusive events, but holds also for the single-dissociation case, as illustrated with lpair simulated events in figure 10; in this case only one of the two possible solutions will correspond to the direction of the intact proton. Studies with lpair indicate that a mass of the dissociating system larger than about 400 GeV is needed in order to produce a deviation comparable to the expected \u03be( + \u2212 ) resolution of about 3% (4%) for dimuons (dielectrons). The latter is obtained from simulation, with an additional smearing to account for residual data-simulation differences. The lpair simulation also indicates that the minimum mass of the dissociating system required to generate activity in the CMS tracker is about 50 GeV; the fraction of dissociative events above this threshold is of a few percent. = 13 TeV s CMS+TOTEM Simulation, Figure 10.

In the calculation, the uncertainty on the integrated luminosity and that on the rapidity gap survival probability are assumed to be fully correlated between the two channels. All other sources are taken as independent. Of the 20 total events selected, 13 have a track in both the near and far RPs. In these events, the two independent \u03be measurements agree within 4%.",

The Roman Pot alignment and LHC optics corrections have been determined using a high statistics sample of forward protons. A total of 12 \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 and 8 \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 e + e \u2212 events are observed with dilepton invariant mass larger than 110 GeV, and a forward proton with consistent kinematics. This corresponds to an excess larger than five standard deviations over the expected background from double-dissociative and Drell-Yan dilepton processes. The result represents the first observation of proton-tagged \u03b3\u03b3 collisions at the electroweak scale. The present data demonstrate the excellent performance of CT-PPS and its potential for high-mass exclusive (proton-tagged) measurements. With its 2016 operation, CT-PPS has proven for the first time the feasibility of continuously operating a near-beam proton spectrometer at a high-luminosity hadron collider.",
