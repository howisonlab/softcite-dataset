            "text": "Baryon number seems to be a conserved quantity in order to explain the stability of matter, yet baryon number must be violated to explain the predominance of matter over antimatter in the universe [1]. Single nucleon decay processes that violate baryon number by one unit but conserve \u2206|B \u2212 L| (where B is baryon number and L is lepton number) have been studied extensively at Super-Kamiokande [2][3][4][5][6] in the context of Grand Unified Theories (GUTs) that predict an unstable proton. Lower limits on proton decay modes such as p \u2192 e + \u03c0 0 of 1.2 \u00d7 10 34 years [7] have ruled out the simplest GUTs, such as minimal SU (5) [8]. Other processes, such as those that violate B by two units, are of great theoretical interest although not necessarily predicted by GUT-inspired models. Searches for such processes constitute an important subset of searches for baryon number violation, both in their own right and given the continued nonobservation of single nucleon decay. Discovery of such a process would be a spectacular revelation of new physics, while non-observation provides important constraints on the theories which predict them. Dinucleon decay -the simultaneous decay of two bound nucleons into leptons or mesons -constitutes such a process. In this paper we search for the processes 16 O(pp) \u2192 14 C\u03c0 + \u03c0 + , 16 O(pn) \u2192 14 N\u03c0 + \u03c0 0 , and 16 O(nn) \u2192 14 O\u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 (abbreviated throughout to pp \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + , pn \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 0 , and nn \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 ).",

The experimentally accessible processes of this kind are dinucleon decay and neutron-antineutron oscillation (n-nbar). The latter process may also be pursued in experiments with free neutrons [10], whereas dinucleon decay requires the close overlap of bound nucleons. The tree-level Feynman diagram for n-nbar and dinucleon decay to pions is the same, with two spectator quarks in the latter case. An example of a dinucleon decay diagram from one of the models discussed in [9] is shown in Fig. 1. The expected time scale for dinucleon decay to pions can be related to the time scale for n-nbar, if the same operator is dominant for each process. This is discussed further in Appendix A. * Deceased.",

Inwardfacing, 20-inch photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) collect Cherenkov light in the ID, while light from penetrating particles (typically cosmic-ray muons) is detected by 8inch, outward-facing PMTs in the OD. The fiducial volume of the ID is defined as the cylindrical volume with surfaces two meters inward from the ID wall. This corresponds to 22.5 ktons, and 7.5 \u00d7 10 33 oxygen nuclei. SK has had four data-taking periods. It began taking data in April 1996, with 11,146 PMTs covering 40% of the ID surface. The first data-taking period, called SK-I, continued until July 2001, totaling 1489.2 livetime days, or 91.7 kton-years. An accident occurred in November 2001, which caused the implosion of about half of the ID PMTs. The remaining 5,182 PMTs were re-distributed uniformly on the surface of the ID, providing 19% photocoverage. To prevent such accidents in the future, each PMT has been enclosed in acrylic and fiber-reinforced plastic cases. The second data-taking period, which used this decreased photo-coverage, lasted from December 2002 until October 2005, and is called SK-II. This lasted 798.6 livetime days, or 49.2 kton-years. Replacement PMTs were produced and the photo-coverage was returned to 40% in 2006. The third data-taking period, from July 2006 until September 2008, is called SK-III, comprising 518.1 livetime days (31.9 kton-years). The detector was upgraded in the summer of 2008, with improved electronics that record all PMT hit information without dead time [14]  [15]. This is the current configuration of the detector, called SK-IV. In this paper, SK-IV data are used up to March 2014, which comprises 1775.6 livetime days (109.3 kton-years). The total SKI-IV dataset is 282.1 kton-years.",

Since each of the four SK data-taking periods have different detector configurations, separate sets of MC for both the dinucleon decay signal and the atmospheric neutrino background are used for each period. The dinucleon decay MC is based on single nucleon decay MC used for previous SK analyses [2][3][4][5][6]. The atmospheric neutrino MC is the same MC sample used in other SK analyses, as described in detail in [16].",

Reference [18] estimates that 10% of single nucleons that undergo decay have wavefunctions that are correlated with other nucleons in the nucleus; we assume the same level of correlation for dinucleon decay pairs. Such correlated decay events typically have a lower total invariant mass, due to the momentum of the correlated nucleon, which is below Cherenkov threshold (Fig. 2). The positions of the decaying nucleons in 16 O are approximated using the Woods-Saxon nuclear density model [19]. Dinucleon decay leaves the remaining nucleus in an excited state from which it de-excites by the emission of gamma rays. However, the de-excitation gamma rays are on the order of a few MeV, while the pions are on the order of a GeV, so the extra light coming from the gamma rays is negligible relative to the pions. The main difference in dinucleon decay simulation from single-nucleon decay is the available phase space. For dinucleon decay, the initial total momentum and energy are summed over both nucleons (or three nucleons, if there is a correlated decay). Pion-nucleon interactions in the nucleus are simulated using NEUT [20]. The interactions modeled include quasielastic scattering, in which the incoming and outgoing pion have the same charge, but there is some energy loss; charge exchange (e.g. \u03c0 + + n \u2192 \u03c0 0 + p); absorption (e.g. \u03c0 + + n \u2192 p); and hadron production (e.g. \u03c0 + + p \u2192 \u03c0 + + \u03c0 0 + p). Quasielastic scattering is relevant at all pion momenta, as is charge exchange, although it has a lower overall cross-section. Absorption has a sizable cross-section in the pion momentum range 100-300 MeV/c range, but is negligle elsewhere. Hadron production is relevant for pion momentum greater than 500 MeV/c, and is therefore relevant for most pions im-mediately after the decay. With these effects taken into account, less than half of the generated events in each mode escape the nucleus in the original pion configuration (Table I).",

Thus, the time period 800-1200 ns after the main event was excluded from the Michel electron search. The improved electronics of SK-IV eliminated this signal reflection, and as a result the tagging efficiency has improved from 80% to 96% for \u00b5 + decays and 63% to 83% for \u00b5 \u2212 decays between SK-I-III and SK-IV.

The characterization of such events is made difficult due to the interactions of charged pions in both the residual oxygen nucleus and the water. Interactions in the water lead to truncated Cherenkov light signatures, which typically lead to poor momentum reconstruction. Thus, for modes involving at least one \u03c0 + (pp \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + and pn \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 0 ), simple selection criteria based on kinematic variables such as the total momentum and invariant mass that are used in other nucleon decay analyses do not give optimal sensitivity. For these modes, a multivariate method is applied to statistically identify events with some, but perhaps not all, of the expected characteristics that differentiate signal and background. Specifically, a boosted decision tree (BDT) method is used. The method is implemented in the ROOT-based TMVA [31] analysis library. This was also used in the dinucleon decay analysis in [11].",

(a2) The ratio of charge carried by the highest-energy ring to the total charge of all rings. This is expected to be smaller for signal, since the pions are expected to have roughly equal energy. By contrast, we expect most of the energy from a chargedcurrent (CC) atmospheric neutrino event to be in the charged lepton ring. (a3) The total visible energy. This has a broad distribution up to 1600 MeV for the signal, but peaks at a lower value for the background around 200 MeV. (a4) The maximum distance between a Michel electron vertex and the primary event vertex. We expect this to be larger for energetic muons than for pions, since the muons penetrate water without sudden hadronic interactions. Muons above Cherenkov threshold sometimes appear in the signal (about 9% of the time), but are much more common in the background, due to charged-current \u03bd \u00b5 interactions such as single pion production. (a5) The maximum angle between any \u00b5-like ring direction vector, and any Michel electron vertex vector (as pointed to from the primary vertex). Similar to (a1), this is designed to look for \"back-to-back\" events, and is an additional check on the topology of the \u00b5-like rings. (a6) The magnitude of the vector sum of corrected charge associated with all rings, where the corrections are applied for various factors, as described in Section IV. This is similar to the total momentum, since the corrected charge associated with each ring is used to determine its momentum. Due to typically poor momentum resolution from hadronic energy losses, it is preferable to use this variable instead of the total momentum. (a7) The number of Cherenkov rings. Though we are trying to isolate two pions, they typically interact in the water, often producing visible secondary tracks, so that the number of rings distribution peaks at three. By contrast, the Cherenkov ring spectrum for the background falls with increasing ring number. (a8) The number of Michel electrons. Naively we would expect two Michel electrons from two charged pions. However, the pions could undergo charge exchange or absorption, leading to zero or one Michel electrons. Though the signal and background distributions both peak at one decay electron, this variable is relatively independent of most of the other variables, which depend on Cherenkov ringcounting.

Table VII shows values of the BDT input variables for each candidate, compared to the means of the signal and background distributions. While both candidate events appear signal-like in some variables, particularly the angle between \u00b5-like rings (both candidates) and energy variables (SK-IV candidate), the candidates are consistent with the expected background rate for each SK period (Table V), as well as the total background rate of 4.5 expected across SKI-IV.

The dominant systematic uncertainty for all modes come from pion final state interaction (FSI) uncertainties. To estimate this, we generated separate sets of dinucleon decay MC for 24 parameter variations consisting of 1-sigma changes in pion-nucleon cross-sections, corresponding to uncertainties determined from fits to pion scattering data. This is the same set of variations used in the T2K \u03bd e appearance result [30]. The variations affect the cross section for both low-energy (charge exchange, absorption, quasi-elastic scattering) and high-energy (hadron production) interactions. These variations were propagated through all stages of the analysis. For the pp \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + and pn \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 0 modes, each set of MC was processed with the trained, unvaried BDT used for the data and analysis MC. The systematic error is conservatively taken to be the largest percentage change in efficiency across all variations upon applying all of the analysis selection criteria. Other significant simulation systematic uncertainties come from Fermi motion (\u223c20%) and correlated decay (\u223c10%). These are not passed through the BDT, but estimated through a simple re-weighting method of the final event sample. For Fermi motion, the re-weighting comes from differences between the Fermi momentum simulation for dinucleon decay and the Fermi gas model. For correlated decay, the effect is not well understood, and so a conservative 100% uncertainty is placed on the detection efficiency of events with a correlated decay, which is 10% at the simulation stage and still about 10% in the final event sample.",

This is mainly due to a 40% uncertainty in the \u03c0 0 /\u03c0 + production ratio. Other simulation systematic uncertainties due to pion FSI and neutrino flux are also considered. The most important reconstruction systematic uncertainty for both dinucleon decay and atmospheric neutri-nos comes from the energy scale. The energy scale uncertainty is determined from comparing the absolute momenta of data and MC for several control samples, such as cosmic ray muons, their resulting decay electrons, and \u03c0 0 's from neutral current interactions. Time variation in the reconstructed momenta of the control samples is also taken into account in the uncertainty calculation. The energy scale uncertainty is estimated to be 1.1%, 1.7%, 2.7%, and 2.3% for SK-I, II, III, and IV, respectively [5]  [30]. This uncertainty is propagated into all energy-dependent variables, and is propagated through the trained, unvaried BDT used for the data and analysis MC for pp \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + and pn \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 0 .
