No signal is observed, and we set an upper limit on the branching fraction of B(B 0 \u2192 \u03c6\u03b3) < 1.0 \u00d7 10 \u22127 at 90% confidence level.

These amplitudes are proportional to the small Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa [2] matrix element V td and thus are highly suppressed. The branching fraction has been estimated based on naive QCD factorization [3] and perturbative QCD [4] and found to be in the range 10 \u221212 to 10 \u221211 . However, the internal loop can also be mediated by non-SM particles such as a charged Higgs boson or supersymmetric squarks, and thus the decay is sensitive to new physics (NP). It is estimated that such NP could enhance the branching fraction to the level of 10 \u22129 to 10 \u22128 [3]. Experimentally, no evidence for this decay has been found, and the current upper limit on the branching fraction is 8.5 \u00d7 10 \u22127 at 90% confidence level (C.L.) [5]. Here, we present a search for this decay using the full Belle data set of 711 fb \u22121 recorded on the \u03a5(4S) resonance. This integrated luminosity corresponds to (772 \u00b1 11) \u00d7 10 6 BB pairs, which is more than six times the amount of data used previously to search for this mode. The Belle experiment ran at the KEKB asymmetricenergy e + e \u2212 collider located at the KEK laboratory [6]. The detector is a large-solid-angle magnetic spectrometer consisting of a silicon vertex detector (SVD), a 50-layer central drift chamber (CDC), an array of aerogel thresh-oldCerenkov counters (ACC), a barrel-like arrangement of time-of-flight scintillation counters (TOF), and an electromagnetic calorimeter (ECL) comprising CsI(Tl) crystals. These detector components are located inside a superconducting solenoid coil that provides a 1.5 T magnetic field. An iron flux-return located outside the coil (KLM) is instrumented to detect K 0 L mesons and to identify muons. Two inner detector configurations were used: a 2.0 cm beampipe and a three-layer SVD were used for the first 140 fb \u22121 of data, while a 1.5 cm beampipe, a four-layer SVD, and a small-cell inner drift chamber were used for the remaining 571 fb \u22121 of data. The detector is described in detail elsewhere [7,8].",
