The data analyzed were collected in 2016 with the CMS detector at the LHC and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 . The measured fiducial inclusive product of cross section and branching fraction agrees with next-to-next-to-leading order quantum chromodynamics calculations. Differential cross sections of the transverse momentum p T , the optimized angular variable \u03c6 * \u03b7 , and the rapidity of lepton pairs are measured. The data are corrected for detector effects and compared to theoretical predictions using fixed order, resummed, and parton shower calculations. The uncertainties of the measured normalized cross sections are smaller than 0.5% for \u03c6 * \u03b7 < 0.5 and for p Z T < 50 GeV.",

The large cross section and clean experimental signature allow precision tests of the standard model (SM), as well as constraints on the parton distribution functions (PDFs) of the proton. In addition, a measurement of the Z production process can set stringent constraints on physics beyond the standard model. Moreover, dilepton events are valuable for calibrating the detector and monitoring the LHC luminosity. The Z/\u03b3 * \u2192 + \u2212 process, where is a muon or an electron, is referred to as the Z boson process in this paper.",

This is due to the intrinsic p T of the initial-state partons inside the proton, as well as initial-state radiation of gluons and quarks. Measurements of the p T distribution of the Z boson probe various aspects of the strong interaction. In addition, an accurate theoretical prediction of the p T distribution is a key ingredient for a precise measurement of the W boson mass at the Tevatron and LHC.",

The y Z distribution in pp collisions is strongly correlated with the longitudinal momentum fraction x of the initial partons and provides constraints on the PDFs of proton. The precision of the Z boson p T measurements is limited by the uncertainties in the p T measurements of charged leptons from Z boson decays. The observable \u03c6 * \u03b7 [38,39] is defined by the expression 1) where \u2206\u03b7 and \u2206\u03c6 are the differences in pseudorapidity and azimuthal angle, respectively, between the two leptons. In the limit of negligible lepton mass rapidity and pseudorapidity are identical. The variable \u03b8 * \u03b7 indicates the scattering angle of the lepton pairs with respect to the beam in the boosted frame where the leptons are aligned. The observable \u03c6 * \u03b7 follows an approximate relationship \u03c6 * \u03b7 \u223c p Z T /m , so the range \u03c6 * \u03b7 \u2264 1 corresponds to p Z T up to about 100 GeV for a lepton pair mass close to the nominal Z boson mass. The measurement resolution of \u03c6 * \u03b7 is better than that of p T since it depends only on the angular direction of the leptons and benefits from the excellent spatial resolution of the CMS inner tracking system. The Z boson \u03c6 * \u03b7 distribution was previously measured by the D0 [37], ATLAS [21], CMS [40], and LHCb [32] Collaborations.",

Only charged hadrons originating from the primary vertex are included in the sum. Collision events are collected using single-electron and single-muon triggers that require the presence of an isolated lepton with p T larger than 24 GeV, ensuring a trigger efficiency above 96% for events passing the offline selection. The event selection aims to identify either \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 or e + e \u2212 pairs compatible with a Z boson decay. Therefore, the selected Z boson candidates are required to have two oppositely charged same-flavor leptons, muons or electrons, with a reconstructed invariant mass within 15 GeV the nominal Z boson mass [56]. In addition, both leptons are required to have |\u03b7| < 2.4 and p T > 25 GeV.

Leptons are required to have p T > 25 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.4, and a dilepton invariant mass |m \u2212 91.1876 GeV| < 15 GeV. A small fraction (3%) of selected signal events do not originate from the fiducial region because of detector effects. This contribution is treated as background and subtracted from the data yield. The measured distributions, after subtracting the contributions from the background processes, are corrected for detector resolution effects and inefficiencies due to so-called dressed lepton kinematics. The dressed leptons at generator level are defined by combining the four-momentum of each lepton after the final-state photon radiation (FSR) with that of photons found within a cone of \u2206R = 0.1 around the lepton. By using this definition, the measured kinematic distributions for Z boson decays to the muon final state and to the electron final state agree to better than 0.1%. The rapidity measurement is restricted to |y Z | < 2.4. The p T and \u03c6 * \u03b7 measurements are restricted to p T < 1500 GeV and \u03c6 * \u03b7 < 50, respectively. There are less than 0.001% of events with p T > 1500 GeV and less than 0.02% with \u03c6 * \u03b7 > 50. The efficiencies for the reconstruction, identification, and isolation requirements on the leptons are obtained in bins of p T and \u03b7 using the \"tag-and-probe\" technique [58]. Scale factors are applied as event weights on the simulated samples to correct for the differences in the efficiencies measured in the data and the simulation. The combined scale factor for the reconstruction, identification, and isolation efficiencies for leptons ranges from 0.9 to 1.0, with an uncertainty of about 0.4 (0.7)% for muons (electrons). Momentum scale corrections are applied to the muons and electrons in both data and simulated events [59].",

The electroweak corrections are important at high p T with expected correction factors of up to 0.9 at p T = 500 GeV and 0.8 at p T = 1000 GeV [6,7]. They are not included in the predictions shown in figure 7. Figure 8 shows the measured absolute cross sections in bins of \u03c6 * \u03b7 . The measurements are compared to the predictions from MadGraph5 amc@nlo, PB TMD, and powheg-MINLO. The predictions are consistent with the measurements within the theoretical uncertainties and describe data well at low p T . As expected the PB TMD predictions deviate from data at high p T .   \u03b7 for the dimuon (upper) and dielectron (middle) final states, and for the combination (lower).
