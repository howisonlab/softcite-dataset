These Sakharov conditions [6] are necessary to generate the baryon asymmetry when assuming symmetric initial conditions and CPT conservation. Neither the CP-violation nor the out-of-equilibrium condition can be accomodated without extending the SM in some way.

The stability of spiral galaxies, and their observed rotation curves require an additional (cold) matter component to be clustered on galactic scale. This additional component contains a significant fraction of the total mass of the Galaxy and has a greater spatial extent than the visible galactic matter. Observations of the CMB tell us about the average properties of the Universe that these microwave photons have passed through since the epoch of decoupling. Again this tells us that, on average, SM matter can only account for approximately 5% of the Universe that we see, and that there is an additional 25% of our current universe which appears to be cold and dark nonrelativistic matter.

The canonical example involves a heavy particle with mass between 100 and 1000 GeV interacting through the weak force (WIMPs), but so far no WIMP has been observed. However a thermal origin is equally compelling even if DM is not a WIMP: DM with any mass from a MeV to tens of TeV can achieve the correct relic abundance by annihilating directly into SM matter. Thermal DM in the MeV-GeV range with SM interactions is overproduced in the early Universe so viable scenarios require additional SM neutral mediators to deplete the overabundance [12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20]. The sub-GeV range for the DM mediators can additionally provide a solution to some outstanding cosmological puzzles including an explanation of why the mass distribution at the center of a galaxy is smoother than expected.

If this condition is relaxed the theory can be generalized to one of axion-like-particles (ALPs) and such a generalization may also be motivated from string theory. The search for axions and ALPs in the sub-eV mass range comprises a plethora of different experimental techniques and experiments as haloscopes, solar helioscopes and pure laboratory experiments among which, for example, regeneration or light-shining-through a wall (LSW) experiments.

Such particles are thought to be linked to a so called hidden sector. Given the exceptionally low-couplings, a high intensity source is necessary to produce them at a detectable rate: this can be astrophysical sources, or powerful lasers, or highintensity accelerator beams.

Taking a single pseudoscalar field a one can write a set of its couplings to photons, quarks, leptons and other fields of the SM. In principle, the set of possible couplings is very large and in this study we consider only the flavor-diagonal subset\u02dc\u02dc( The DS Lagrangian may contain new states that provide a UV completion to this model (for the case of the QCD axion they are called the Peccei-Quinn sector).

The IAXO magnet will be a superconducting magnet following a large multi-bore toroidal configuration, to efficiently produce an intense magnetic field over a large volume. The design is inspired by the ATLAS barrel and end-cap toroids, the largest superconducting toroids ever built and presently in operation at CERN. Indeed the experience of CERN in the design, construction and operation of large superconducting magnets is crucial for the project. IAXO will also make extensive use of novel detection concepts pioneered at a small scale in CAST. This includes x-ray focussing and low background detectors. The former relies on the fact that, at grazing incident angles, it is possible to realize x-ray mirrors with high reflectivity. IAXO envisions newly-built optics similar to those used onboard NASA's NuSTAR satellite mission, but optimized for the energies of the solar axion spectrum. Each of the eight \u223c60 cm diameter magnet bores will be equipped with such optics. For BabyIAXO, using existing optics from the ESA's XMM mission is being considered. At the focal plane of each of the optics, IAXO will have low-background x-ray detectors. Several technologies are under consideration, but the most developed one are small gaseous chambers read by pixelised microbulk Micromegas planes. They involve low-background techniques typically developed in underground laboratories, like the use of radiopure detector components, appropriate shielding, and the use of offline discrimination algorithms. Alternative or additional x-ray detection technologies are also considered for IAXO, like GridPix detectors, magnetic metallic calorimeters, transition edge sensors, or silicon drift detectors. All of them show promising prospects to outperform the baseline Micromegas detectors in aspects like energy threshold or resolution, which are of interest, for example, to search for solar axions via the axion-electron coupling, a process featuring both lower energies that the standard Primakoff ones, and monochromatic peaks in the spectrum.",

They include about \uf0a075 physicists at the moment. It is likely that this list will increase with new members in the near future. A Collaboration management is already defined and actively implementing steps towards the BabyIAXO design and construction. The experiment will likely be sited at DESY, and it is expected to be built in 2-3 years, entering into data taking in 3-4 years. The Collaboration already nicely encompasses all the know-how to cover BabyIAXO needs, and therefore a distribution of responsibilities in the construction of the experiment exists already. The magnet of (Baby)IAXO is of a size and field strength comparable to that of large detector magnets typically built in high energy physics. For this IAXO relies on the unique expertize of CERN in large superconducting magnets. The CERN magnet detector group has led all magnet design work so far in the IAXO CDR. The technical design of the BabyIAXO magnet, for which CERN has allocated one Applied Fellow, has started in January 2018. Further CERN participation is expected in terms of, at the least, allocation of expert personnel to oversee the construction of the magnet, as well as the use of existing CERN infrastructure. Other groups with magnet expertize in the Collaboration are CEA-Irfu and INR. The groups of LLNL, MIT and INAF are experts in the development and construction of x-ray optics, in particular in the technology chosen for the IAXO optics. Detector expertize exists in many of the Collaboration groups, encompassing the technologies mentioned above. Experience in general engineering, large infrastructure operation and management is present in several groups and in particular in centers like CERN or DESY. Many of the groups have experience in axion phenomenology and the connection with experiment, and more specifically experience with running the CAST experiment.

In fact, while a multi-year R&D effort has been in place for ADRIANO and for the fiber tracker, very little has been done for the moment towards the development of an optical-TPC (O-TPC) prototype. The latter is conditional to the availability of R&D funding which, at present, is still not in place. The Collaboration is meanwhile considering, to launch a simulation campaign to understand if alternative, more conventional solutions could be found that can sustain the event rate expected at REDTOP.",

The M2 line, currently serving the COMPASS experiment, is able to provide muons with momentum of ;(100-160) GeV/c, and intensity up to \u223c10 8 \u03bc/spill. The detector setup follows closely the one currently operating with e \u2212 beam: an active (muon) target followed by a large hadron calorimeter located in a magnetic field, which is used both to measure the outgoing muon momentum and to veto events with associated hadrons. The signal consists of a muon with outgoing momentum significantly lower than the incoming one and no energy deposition in the rest of the detector. A key issue is the purity of the incoming muon beam: a background study performed in 2017 shows that the level of the hadron contamination in the muon beam can be reduced down to the negligible level 10 \u22126 by using nine Be absorbers. Another key issue is the precise measurement of the momentum of the outgoing muon and its identification with high purity.",

Reaching the full potential of the missing-momentum technique places demanding constraints on the experiment and the beamline supporting it. A high repetition rate of electrons is required (as much as \u223c10 9 electrons-on-target (eot) per second) in order to reach the envisaged integrated luminosities of 10 14 -10 16 eot, while keeping an extremely low electron density per bunch ( -e 1 5 /bunch). This requires a fast detector that can individually resolve the energies and angles of incident electrons, while simultaneously rejecting a variety of potential background processes that vary in rate over many orders of magnitude. The LDMX design makes use of a low-mass, silicon-based tracking system in a 1.5\uf0a0T dipole magnet to measure the momentum of the incoming electrons, and to cleanly reconstruct electron recoils, thereby providing a measure of missing momentum. A high-speed, high-granularity SiW calorimeter with MIP sensitivity is used to reject potential high rate bremsstrahlung background at trigger level, and to work in tandem with a scintillator-based hadron calorimeter to veto rare photo-nuclear reactions. The design leverages new and existing calorimeter technology under development for the HL-LHC, as well as existing tracking technology and experience from the HPS experiment [80].

The connection to the SPS has been linked to Long Shutdown 3 (i.e. for LHC 2024-2026) but requires that the stop of the North Area is extended by one year (2025-2026). The schedule requires preparation of final prototypes and the TDRs for both the detector and the facility by beginning 2022, and construction and installation between 2023 and beginning 2027.",

To exploit both of these properties, FASER is to be located along the beam collision axis, 480 m downstream from the ATLAS interaction point (IP). At this location, FASER and a larger successor, FASER2, will enhance the LHC's discovery potential by providing sensitivity to dark photons, dark Higgs bosons, HNLs, ALPs, and many other proposed new particles.

Two private foundations contribute to support FASER's construction and operation costs.  The updated status of the Collaboration and experiment are available at: https://twiki. cern.ch/twiki/bin/viewauth/FASER/WebHome. FASER has submitted also a separate document 49 for the next ESPP update. 14 TeV HL-LHC collisions, with lifetimes much greater than the size of the main detectors and up to the BBN constraint of \u223c0.1 s, with the peak sensitivity near \u03b2c\u03c4 \u223c 100 m. MATHUSLA also has a secondary physics case as a cosmic ray telescope.",

The MATHUSLA detector is essentially a large tracker, situated above an air-filled decay fiducial volume on the surface above ATLAS or CMS, that is able to robustly reconstruct displaced vertices (DVs) from the decay of neutral LLPs into two or more charged particles. The tracker should have on the order of five planes to provide robust tracking with \u223c ns timing and cm spatial resolution. This is vital for rejecting cosmic ray (CR) and other backgrounds, and allows for the reconstruction of multi-pronged DV for LLPs with boost up to \u223c10 3 , corresponding to minimum LLP mass of ( \uf04f 10 MeV) if the LLP is produced in exotic B-meson decays and ( ) -\uf04f 0.1 1 GeV for weak or TeV scale production [109]. Analyzing the geometry and multiplicity of the DV final states also allows the LLP decay mode and mass to be determined in many scenarios [102]. A layer of detectors in the floor is also considered, since this will improve LLP reconstruction and provide additional veto capabilities that may be necessary to reject upwards-going backgrounds like high-energy muons from the HL-LHC.",

MATHUSLA requirements on resolution and rate are significantly lower compared to past experiments using similar detector technologies. The scale of the detector area is a further opportunity for cost optimization by employing mass production techniques. The detector size and location are currently being optimized to take into account land constraints and opportunities, with the hope to be able to reduce the size while keeping similar sensitivity. The detector design is modular for a staged implementation. The total cost will be driven by civil engineering and the large area tracking detectors. The Collaboration is investigating low-cost solutions with the challenging goal to keep the overall cost of the full size detector below 100\uf0a0MCHF. (2) Background: As was argued in detail in [97], it is crucial for the projected sensitivities that MATHUSLA can search for LLP decays without backgrounds. The surface location shields MATHUSLA from ubiquitous QCD backgrounds from the LHC collision. It was quantitatively demonstrated that muon and neutrino backgrounds from the IP can be sufficiently rejected. Extremely stringent signal requirements and 4-dimensional DV reconstruction would limit the probability of cosmic rays to fake the hadronic or even leptonic LLP decays. Background estimates using a combination of detailed Monte Carlo studies with full detector simulation, the known cosmic ray spectrum, and empirical measurements at the LHC using a test stand detector, are currently in progress. The outcome of these studies will quantitatively determine whether the proposed background rejection strategies are sufficiently effective to reach the zero-background regime. However, to date, no quantitative analysis based on the full GEANT4 simulation of the detector with large Monte Carlo samples has been shown, and, as such, the assumption that MATHUSLA200 is a zero-background experiment is still to be demonstrated.",

The purpose of the detector is to search for new, neutral LLPs which would penetrate the shield and decay in the detector volume. The largest gain in reach is for relatively light LLPs-i.e. m\uf0a0\uf0a010GeV-for which the backgrounds in ATLAS and CMS are prohibitive. The LLPs can be produced from hadron or Higgs decays, or as decay products from other, BSM states. Due to its proximity to the IP, CODEX-b is competitive with MATHUSLA200 in the low lifetime regime, despite its smaller acceptance and luminosity. The close distance to LHCb also means that CODEX-b can be interfaced with the LHCb trigger and reconstruction streams, as a true subdetector of the experiment.",

In particular, the branching fractions (BRs) for the decays pnn \uf0ae K are among the observables in the quark-flavor sector most sensitive to NP. Because they are strongly suppressed and calculated very precisely in the SM, these BRs are potentially sensitive to mass scales of hundreds of TeV, surpassing the sensitivity of B decays in most SM extensions [117]. Observations of lepton-flavor-universalityviolating phenomena are mounting in the B-sector. Measurements of the pnn \uf0ae K BRs are critical to interpreting the data from rare B decays, and may demonstrate that these effects are a manifestation of new degrees of freedom such as leptoquarks [118][119][120]. The KLEVER project aims at measuring the BR of the very rare decays p nn \uf0ae K L 0 with 20% accuracy, assuming the SM branching fraction.

This is a six-fold increase in the primary intensity relative to NA62. The feasibility of an upgrade to provide this intensity on the T10 target is under study in the Conventional Beams working group [75]. Preliminary indications are positive: there is general progress on issues related to the slow extraction of the needed intensity to the North Area (including duty cycle optimization); a workable solution for T4-to-T10 bypass has been identified. The ventilation in the TCC8 cavern appears to be reasonably hermetic, obviating the need for potentially expensive upgrades.

Several efforts (at PSI, ILL, LANL, TRIUMF) will use improved intensities of UCN stored in vacuum and at room temperature. One effort (at SNS) aims at conducting the measurement with UCN inside cold superfluid He (SFHe). The SFHe environment offers advantages [145] of potentially larger numbers of UCN exposed to larger electric fields, however, at the cost of considerable complication of the setup and handling. A first measurement in the cryogenic environment has still to be demonstrated. Beyond 10 years, some proposed or ongoing R&D efforts might succeed with cryogenic setups. Alternatively, also an experiment at a pulsed cold neutron beam of the ESS has been proposed [146]. ( (95% C.L.) [147].

            "text": "necessary. The charm quark as well as the muon might via unexpectedly large EDM give clues on specific flavor structure of new physics. The experiment concept relies on a bent crystal to extract protons from the LHC beam halo. These protons will then hit a dense target and produce charged heavy and strange baryons that will then be channeled in bent crystals positioned in front of the detector. The intense electric field between the crystal atomic planes is able to induce a sizeable spin precession during the lifetime of the particle. The EDM, along with the magnetic dipole moment [159] can be determined by analyzing the angular distribution of the decay particles. Recently, the possibility to use the same technology for measuring the EDM (and MDM) of the tau lepton has been discussed in [160,161]. The LHC interaction point IP8, where the LHCb detector [162,163] sits, has been identified as a suitable location of the experiment. A main challenge is represented by the limited coverage of the detector in the very forward region, requiring a secondary crystal with a large bending exceeding 15 mrad. A W target of \u22482 cm thickness hit by a proton flux of \u224810 7 protons s \u22121 is the upper limit for a parallel detector operation. R&D is ongoing to assess the feasibility of the secondary crystal along other challenges of the proposal, which include the compatibility with the machine, its operation mode, maximum reachable proton flux and the design of the absorber downstream the detector. About2.4 10 14 protons on target could be reached in Run 3 with three years of data taking after the installation during an LHC technical stop, either with two weeks per year of a dedicated detector running at 10 8 \uf0a0proton s \u22121 or with a parallel detector operation at 10 7 \uf0a0proton s \u22121 . This would lead to EDM sensitivities of about 10 \u221217 ecm for charm baryons. Extending the detector coverage down to 10 mrad along with an increase of the proton flux during LHC Run\uf0a04 and Run\uf0a05, either at LHCb or at a dedicated experiment would improve sensitivity by about one order of magnitude. Figure 14 shows the EDM sensitivity for different baryons in two different scenarios, scenario 1 (S1) corresponds to data collected at the LHCb interaction point in a first phase at low luminosity (about 2\uf0a0\u00d7\uf0a010 14 pot); scenario 2 (S2) corresponds to data collected at a possible next-generation experiment at higher luminosity (\u223c10 17 ) and enhanced coverage.",

The spin analysis in this case is achieved by a newly developed deuteron polarimeter. Numerous preparations including polarimetry and spin manipulation are already being studied by the JEDI Collaboration. The COSY experiment is an indispensable proof of principle at \u223c10 \u221224 ecm sensitivity for a ring experiment using a dedicated magnetic storage ring for deuterons (or protons) at CERN, which is needed to observe or establish a limit on the deuteron EDM at the level of 10 \u221229 ecm. For a deuteron experiment at CERN a new magnetic storage ring is required with some 80 m circumference to store polarized deuterons and observe the time evolution of their polarization. The precursor experiment at COSY is expected to develop all required detectors with sufficient sensitivity and to test the viability of the approach for hadrons. Both the muon and deuteron EDM experiment concepts take advantage of the fact that the magnetic anomaly is rather small and therefore magnetic spin precession in a magnetic storage ring can be compensated effectively by radial electrostatic fields.",

For sensitivity 10 \u221229 ecm it exploits a proton beam of 233 MeV energy. The device needs provision for clockwise and counter-clockwise particle injection to minimize systematics. External magnetic fields at the experimental site need to be compensated to some 10\uf0a0nT all over the particle storage volume and through the experimental running time. The substantial necessary expenses require a full structured program of stepwise testing of all essential concepts and necessary devices. The proton EDM project at CERN is a joint effort of the proton and deuteron EDM communities. It appears that a small size proof of principle experiment would be indispensable. An experiment on the proton EDM tests to a large part the same speculative models as the neutron EDM, except for those constructed with isospin dependence. Therefore a proton EDM experiment will need to exceed the prospected future sensitivity values expected for neutron experiments in order to justify the expenditures. Here, one expects some 10 \u221227 ecm by 2025 and 10 \u221228 ecm by 2030. Note that, for the deuteron an EDM can arise from either a proton or a neutron EDM (or both) and in addition an EDM may be due to CP violating parts in the proton-neutron interaction of the deuteron binding. Both experiments, once they have proven sufficient sensitivity, are therefore strongly motivated and they have robust discovery potential.

Large volume magnets are therefore a primary ingredient for such a research. By using a prototype LHC dipole magnet with 9\uf0a0T magnetic field along 9.3 m length, CAST for the first time was able to explore solar axion in the QCD model range, in the mass region 0.1-1 eV. To maximize observing efficiency, the magnet was supported by a structure capable to track the Sun for a sizeable fraction of the day. The last CAST result [169] set the current best limit on the axion-photon coupling strength (0.66\uf0a0\u00d7 10 \u221210 GeV \u22121 at 95% confidence level), thus competing with the most stringent limits from astrophysics on this coupling. CAST has also searched for other axion production channels in the Sun, enabled by the axion-electron or the axion-nucleon couplings. The project is now over, and the magnet may be utilized for building a haloscope (project RADES [171]). Most of the CAST Collaboration will be entering IAXO. Among the key elements of the CAST apparatus were the use of x-ray focusing optics and very low background micromegas detector. Figure 15.

            "text": "(2) ADMX Axion or ALPs can be the main component of the dark matter halo of our galaxy and produce measurable signals in a suitable terrestrial detector. Such a detector usually exploits the long coherence length of these low mass particles, inside the galactic halo, in such a way to obtain detectability in spite of their very weak interactions with ordinary matter. Under the assumption that the searched for particle is the only constituent of the DM halo, limits on the coupling can be obtained in the absence of a detected signal. Strictly speaking, the limit is on the product between the coupling and the fraction of the local DM density in the case of a subdominant component. The oldest strategy to search for axions is the Sikivie or Primakoff haloscope [40], which has given almost all current limits for direct detection of dark matter in the sub eV range. In a Sikivie type detector, a high Q tunable microwave resonator is immersed in a strong static magnetic field. DM axions can be converted into real photons via a Primakoff process and deposit energy into the resonant mode of the cavity. In the last two decades the Axion dark matter experiment-ADMX-has implemented this method for cavities in the GHz range. Under the assumption of dominant DM component for the axion, ADMX has excluded the KSVZ axion in the 1.91-3.69 \u03bceV mass range [170], and very recently the DFSZ one in the 2.66-2.81 \u03bceV range [164]. The apparatus is based on a large volume high Q tunable copper cavity, operated in the sub-K temperature range and read by a SQUID based detection chain. Coverage of masses up to 40 \u03bceV (10 GHz) is envisioned for the near future by combining the outputs of multiple co-tuned cavity resonators in the current 8 T superconducting magnet.",

In addition, this is compared to the physics reach in the same mass range of several proposed experiments at the LHC interaction points. In this section their physics reach is presented, compared against each other and put in the worldwide context. The presentation of the results follows the scheme outlined in section 2.1 where 11 benchmark cases were identified as theoretically well motivated target areas to explore. The 11 benchmark cases do not pretend to be exhaustive, but only to provide a common ground to compare different sensitivities from different experiments. These benchmark cases should be considered as the starting point towards a comprehensive investigation of hidden sector models in the MeV-GeV mass range that could be performed in the future. The results are shown in the next sections as 90% CL exclusion limits and compared to the existing bounds and the physics reach of other similar initiatives proposed worldwide on the same timescale.",

New, but already consolidated projects (as, e.g. LDMX and SHiP) can profit from detailed Monte Carlo simulations and a thorough level of understanding of possible background sources. More recent proposals, instead, are in the process of implementing a full simulation and for this study they have evaluated their physics reach mostly based on toy Monte Carlo or fast simulation.

While a full simulation of the detector is still do be done, a preliminary study with FLUKA has shown that possible backgrounds of high-energy (>100 GeV) particles and radiation levels at the FASER location are very low.

The backgrounds considered were: neutrinos produced through the initial collision that undergo deep inelastic scattering anywhere in the SHiP facility producing V 0 s; muons deflected by the shield that undergo deep inelastic scattering in the experimental hall or anywhere within the decay volume producing V 0 s; muons in coincidence from the same spill (combinatorial muons) escaping the shield; cosmic muons interacting anywhere in the decay volume or with experimental hall. The rate and momentum spectrum of the muon halo obtained with the full simulation is being calibrated using data from a dedicated 1 month long run performed in July 2018 where a smaller replica of the SHiP target was exposed to \u223c5\uf0a0\u00d7 10 11 400 GeV protons. All samples relied on GEANT4 to simulate the entire SHiP target, muon shield, detector, and experimental hall (walls, ceiling, floor). In addition, neutrino interactions were simulated through GENIE.

These projects will be competing with other initiatives in the same timescale, as for example SeaQuest, HPS and LHCb, as shown in figure 18. The physics reach of PBC projects on a 10-15 year timescale is shown in figure 20. On this timescale several projects could be ready and operated, such as REDTOP, SHiP, FASER2, MATHUSLA200, AWAKE, and LDMX. The sensitivity for dark photons decaying in visible final states will be dominated by SHiP, while FASER2, LDMX and AWAKE will be directly competing with SeaQuest, LHCb, HPS, and others as shown in figure 18. MATHUSLA200 in this scenario is however not competitive, mostly due to the fact that the dark photon is produced in the forward direction. Figure 19.

Among the accelerator-based experiments, there are BDX at JLab [227], MiniBooNE at FNAL [228] and COHERENT at ORNL [229], as explained below.  A detector placed \u223c20 m downstream of the Hall-A beam-dump at Jefferson lab is expected to identify a dark matter scattering by measuring a electromagnetic shower produced by the DM interaction with atomic electrons of the detector. The BDX detector is composed by a \u223cGeV electromagnetic calorimeter surrounded by two layers of active plastic scintillator vetos. The calorimeter re-uses \u223c800 CsI(Tl) crystals formerly used in the BaBar EM Cal, upgraded with SiPM-readout and triggerless data acquisition. The experiment makes use of the high energy (\u223c10 GeV) and high intensity (\u223c100 \u03bcA) electron beam available in Hall-A running in parallel (parasitically) with the scheduled hadron physics program. BDX has been approved with the maximum scientific rating (A) by the JLab PAC and granted with 285 PAC-days of data taking, corresponding to an integrated yield of 10 22 eot. The BDX Collaboration is currently seeking for funds to build the new experimental hall that will host the BDX detector. The experiment is expected to be deployed and take data in 2-3 years from now [227]. (2) MiniBooNE @ FNAL (proton beam dump): neutrino detector at the 8 GeV Booster Neutrino Beamline at FNAL.

Couplings between \u03bd R generally violate CP, and the interactions of the \u03bd R in the early universe can potentially generate a matter-antimatter asymmetry in the primordial plasma. At temperatures above T sphaleron \uf0a0=\uf0a0130 GeV [263] this asymmetry can be converted into a net baryon number by weak sphalerons [264]. This process called leptogenesis can either occur during the 'freeze-out' and decay of the \u03bd R [265] ('freeze-out scenario') or during their production [11,266,267] ('freeze-in scenario'). It is one of the most promising explanations for the baryon asymmetry of the Universe (BAU), which is believed to be the origin of baryonic matter in the present day universe, see [268] for a discussion.  HNLs have been studied in connection to large scale structure formation [269], BBN [270], CMB, diffuse extragalactic background radiation, and supernovae [271]. In general, the scale of the HNL masses is entirely unknown; different choices can have a wide range of implications for particle physics, astrophysics and cosmology, see e.g. [272] for an overview. In the neutrino minimal standard model (\u03bdMSM) [11] two HNLs are expected to be in the range MeV-GeV while a third HNL is a DM candidate and can have a mass as low as a few keV. This model is particularly interesting from a phenomenological viewpoint because it is feasible for masses of as low as 10MeV [273], which are well within reach of acceleratorbased experiments.",

The same mass range could also be probed by a FASER2 [85], CODEX-b [115] and MATHUSLA200 [97]. Above the B-meson mass, displaced vertex searches at high energy hadron [86,[283][284][285][286][287] or lepton [284,288] colliders would be more sensitive, see e.g., [287] for a summary. Neutrinos that are heavy enough to decay promptly can leave distinct lepton number and flavor violating signatures in high energy collisions, see [289,290] for a recent review. Current bounds, experimental landscape and PBC projects on 5 year timescale Current bounds and the future experimental landscape in the next \u223c5 years, including some PBC projects, are shown in figure 30 for the case of HNLs with couplings only to the first lepton generation and masses in the MeV-GeV range.",

The background evaluation for MATHUSLA200, CODEX-b and FASER2 is still work in progress and will be carried on in the coming years. Figure 31 shows also projections from the LBNE near detector as 5-year sensitivity corresponding to an exposure of 5 \u00d7 10 21 protons on target for a detector length of Figure 31. BC6: sensitivity to heavy neutral leptons with coupling to the first lepton generation only.

Therefore it is timely and well-motivated to search for further light scalar or pseudoscalar particles. Pseudo-scalar particles can arise as pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone bosons of a spontaneously broken U(1) symmetry at a scale f A . The principal example of very light pseudo-Goldstone bosons is the axion [35][36][37]300] introduced to solve the strong CP problem in QCD. Natural extensions of the axion paradigm bring a wide range of interesting pseudoscalar particles which typically have very similar interactions as the axion, but without a strict relation between the mass and the coupling, the Axion-Like Particles or ALPs.",

            "text": "ALPs also provide an interesting connection to the puzzle of dark matter, because they can mediate the interactions between the DM particle and SM states and allow for additional annihilation channels relevant for the thermal freeze-out of DM. In fact in presence of an additional pseudoscalar particle that mediates the interactions of DM with the SM sector [301,302], constraints from direct detection experiments [303][304][305][306] and invisible Higgs width [307,308] on the scalar portal can be easily evaded [301,302]. Moreover, if the pseudoscalar mass is in the sub-GeV range it can furthermore evade detection at the LHC, as, e.g. in monojet searches [309]. Another advantage of a very light pseudoscalar a is that it allows for the possibility that DM can obtain the correct relic density from thermal freeze-out even if it is very weakly coupled to SM particles. This is due to the fact that, provided the pseudo-scalar mass is less than twice the mass of the DM particle \u03c7, the annihilation process cc \uf0ae aa, followed by decays of the pseudoscalars into SM particles, allows for a highly efficient annihilation of DM particles. The only important constraint is that such pseudoscalar particles must decay before BBN. As explained in section 2.1, ALPs can mediate interactions between DM and the SM sector via three different couplings: photon-, gluon-, and fermion-coupling. ) parameter space. Current bounds and near future experimental landscape The current bounds for ALPs with photon coupling are shown in figure 36, left. A zoom on the region of interest for experiments at accelerators is shown in the right panel and covers a range of masses between MeV and GeV. We note that this is also the mass region of interest in models where ALPs serve as mediators to a DM sector.",

Since the center of mass energy in the collisions for the PBC experiments is small compared to the LHC experiments, this sensitivity comes through modifications of known particle properties through virtual exchanges of New Physics particles. In some cases, when new physics violates exact or approximate symmetries of the SM (such as CP symmetry, and/or lepton flavor), the SM backgrounds are very low. As a result precision measurements can be sensitive to NP in the multi-TeV range.",

One of the key puzzles of the SM, the smallness of CP-violation in the QCD sector, originates from the tight bounds on neutron and atomic EDMs. The axion solution to this strong CP problem implies the existence of heavy Peccei-Quinn sectors at high-energy scales that cannot be directly accessed in high-energy experiments, and so an alternative approach is needed to understand the solution to this problem. New physics at the weak scale (or more generically, TeV scale and beyond) can also induce EDMs. Famously, the Kobayashi-Maskawa CP violation mechanism does not induce neutron or proton EDMs abovee 10 cm",
