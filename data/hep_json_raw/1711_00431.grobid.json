The search is based on the 2016 data sample of proton-proton collisions recorded with the CMS experiment at \u221a s = 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 . The results of this search are interpreted in terms of a simplified model of dark matter production via spin-0 or spin-1 mediators, a scenario with a standard-model-like Higgs boson produced in association with the Z boson and decaying invisibly, a model of unparticle production, and a model with large extra spatial dimensions. No significant deviations from the background expectations are found, and limits are set on relevant model parameters, significantly extending the results previously achieved in this channel.",

The final state considered in this analysis is the production of a pair of leptons ( + \u2212 , where = e or \u03bc), consistent with originating from a Z boson, together with large missing transverse momentum ( p miss T ). This final state is well-suited to probe such beyond the SM (BSM) scenarios, as it has relatively small and precisely known SM backgrounds.",

            "text": "One of the most significant puzzles in modern physics is the nature of dark matter (DM). In the culmination of over a century of observations, the \"\u039b CDM \" standard model of cosmology has established that, in the total cosmic energy budget, known matter only accounts for about 5%, DM corresponds to 27%, and the rest is dark energy [1]. Although several astrophysical observations indicate that DM exists and interacts gravitationally with known matter, there is no evidence yet for nongravitational interactions between DM and SM particles. While the nature of DM remains a mystery, there are a number of models that predict a particle physics origin. If DM particles exist, they can possibly be produced directly from, annihilate into, or scatter off SM particles. Recent DM searches have exploited various methods including direct [2] and indirect [3] detection. If DM can be observed in direct detection experiments, it must have substantial couplings to quarks and/or gluons, and could also be produced at the LHC [4][5][6][7][8][9].",

The study presented here considers one possible mechanism for producing such particles at the LHC [10]. In this scenario, a Z boson, produced in proton-proton (pp) collisions, recoils against a pair of DM particles, \u03c7 \u03c7. The Z boson subsequently decays into two charged leptons, producing a low-background dilepton signature, together with p miss T due to the undetected DM particles. In this analysis, the DM particle \u03c7 is assumed to be a Dirac fermion. Four simplified models of DM production via an s-channel mediator exchange are considered. In these models, the mediator has a spin of 1 (0) and vector or axialvector (scalar or pseudoscalar) couplings to quarks and DM particles. The free parameters of each model are the masses m med and m DM of the mediator and DM particle, respectively, as well as the coupling constant g q (g DM ) between the mediator and the quarks (DM particles). The vector coupling model can be described with the following Lagrangian:",

Example diagrams of DM production via spin-1 and spin-0 mediators are shown in Fig. 1 (upper left and right, respectively). A primary focus of the LHC physics program after the discovery of a Higgs boson (H) [12][13][14] by the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations is the study of the properties of this new particle. The observation of a sizable branching fraction of the Higgs boson to invisible states [15][16][17] would be a strong sign of BSM physics. Supersymmetric (SUSY) models embodying R-parity conservation contain a stable neutral lightest SUSY particle (LSP), e.g., the lightest neutralino [18], leading to the possibility of decays of the Higgs boson into pairs of LSPs. Certain models with extra spatial dimensions predict graviscalars that could mix with the Higgs boson [19]. As a consequence, the Higgs boson could oscillate to a graviscalar and disappear from the SM brane. The signature would be equivalent to an invisible decay of the Higgs boson. There could also be contributions from Higgs boson decays into graviscalars [20]. With the same effect as the simplified DM models presented earlier, \"Higgs portal\" models [21][22][23] construct a generic connection between SM and DM particles via a Higgs boson mediator. This analysis considers decays into invisible particles of an SM-like Higgs boson produced in association with a Z boson, as shown in Fig. 1 (lower left).",

This model predicts graviton (G) production via the process qq \u2192 Z+G. The graviton escapes detection, leading to a mono-Z signature (Fig. 1, lower right). In the ADD model, the apparent Planck scale in four spacetime dimensions is given by M 2 Pl \u2248 M n+2 D R n , where M D is the true Planck scale of the full n+4 dimensional space-time and R is the compactification radius of the extra dimensions. Assuming M D is of the same order as M EW , the observed large value of M Pl points to an R of order 1 mm to 1 fm for 2 to 7 extra dimensions. The consequence of the large compactification scale is that the mass spectrum of the Kaluza-Klein graviton states becomes nearly continuous, resulting in a broad Z boson transverse momentum ( p T ) spectrum.",

In the high-energy regime, a new, scale invariant Banks-Zaks field with a nontrivial infrared fixed point is introduced [27]. The interaction between the SM and Banks-Zaks sectors is mediated by particles of large mass scale M U , below which the interaction is suppressed and can be treated via an effective field theory (EFT). The low-energy regime will include unparticles, which have phase space fac-tors equivalent to those of a noninteger number of ordinary particles [28][29][30]. In this analysis, the emission of spin-0 unparticles from SM quarks is considered. Because of the weakness of the unparticle interactions with the SM fields, the unparticle evades detection. The EFT Lagrangian used to interpret the results is defined as follows:",

In order to ensure the validity of the EFT, the signal is truncated for\u015d > M 2 D , where\u015d is the center-of-mass energy squared of the incoming partons. Events above this threshold are suppressed by an additional weight of M 4 D /\u015d 2 . In general, this procedure has a larger effect for large values of n, for which the distribution of\u015d is shifted towards higher values [53]. For the unparticle case, samples are generated for scaling dimensions d U between 1.01 and 2.2, with the cutoff scale \u039b U set to 15 TeV and the coupling \u03bb set to 1. Since both \u039b U and \u03bb modify the cross sections of the signal prediction, but not its kinematic distributions [54], a simple rescaling of cross sections is performed to obtain signal predictions for alternative values of these parameters. No truncation is performed for the unparticle signal so that the results can be compared with those of previous searches.",

The contribution to the isolation from the lepton candidate itself is removed. For muons, the isolation sum is required to be smaller than 15% of the muon p T . For electrons in the ECAL barrel (endcap), the limit on this isolation sum is 6.9 (8.2)% of the electron p T . In order to mitigate the dependence of the isolation variable on the number of pileup interactions, charged hadrons are included in the sum only if they are consistent with originating from the selected primary vertex of the event. To correct for the contribution to the isolation sum of neutral hadrons and photons from pileup interactions, different strategies are adopted for electrons and muons. For electrons, a median energy density (\u03c1) is determined on an event-by-event basis using the method described in Ref. [65]. The contribution of the pileup particles is then estimated as a product of \u03c1 and the effective area of the isolation cone and is subtracted from the isolation sum. For muon candidates, the correction is performed instead by subtracting half the sum of the p T of the charged-hadron candidates in the cone of interest, which are not associated with the primary vertex. The factor of one half corresponds to the average ratio of neutral to charged particles in pileup interactions.",

In this column the number in parentheses shows the impact on the BDT-based analysis, if different from that for the p miss T -based analysis. The last part of the this procedure is obtained by varying the event-by-event weight by \u00b11 standard deviation (s.d.).

Upper limits on the contribution of events from new physics are computed by using the modified frequentist approach C L s [88,89] based on asymptotic formulas [90,91], via a simultaneous maximum likelihood fit to the SR and the CRs. The expected numbers of background events and signal events, scaled by a signal strength modifier, are combined in a profile likelihood test statistic, in which the systematic uncertainties are incorporated as nuisance parameters. For the dominant backgrounds in the SR, additional parameters are introduced to link the background expectations in the SR to their respective contributions in the CRs discussed in Sect. 8. To compute limits in all models, a binned likelihood test statistic is employed, based on the p miss T distribution in Fig. 4 and also on the BDT classifier distribution in the case of invisible decays of the SM Higgs boson. Limits from the CRESST-II [92], CDMSLite [93], PandaX-II [94], LUX [95], and XENON1T [96] experiments are shown for the spin-independent case (vector couplings).

The limits consider only quark-induced Higgs boson production. In addition, for the SM (125 GeV) Higgs boson, the limit on branching fraction assuming SM production rate (considering also gluon fusion) is presented. The vertical gray line indicates that the result at m H = 125 GeV should not be read from the plot, as the gluon contribution is known for that point pseudoscalar scenarios. In Fig. 7, limits on the DM-nucleon scattering cross section are set at 90% CL as a function of the DM particle mass and compared to selected results from direct detection experiments. Both spin-dependent and spinindependent cases are considered. In both cases, couplings g q = 0.25 and g DM = 1 are used.",
