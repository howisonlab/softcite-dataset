One primary goal is the search for new hadronic states, in particular spin-exotic mesons and glueballs. We present recent results of partial-wave analyses of (3\u03c0) \u2212 and \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b7 \u2032 final states based on a large data set of diffractive dissociation of a 190 GeV/c \u03c0 \u2212 beam on a proton target in the squared four-momentum-transfer range 0.1 < t \u2032 < 1 (GeV/c) 2 . We also show first results from a partial-wave analysis of diffractive dissociation of K \u2212 into K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 final states are presented.",

It is a two-stage high-resolution spectrometer that covers a wide range of scattering angles and particle momenta. The spectrometer is equipped with hadronic and electromagnetic calorimeters so that final states with charged as well as neutral particles can be reconstructed. A Ring Imaging Cherenkov Detector (RICH) in the first stage can be used for particle identification. It is able to separate kaons from pions up to momenta of 50 GeV/c. The target is surrounded by a Recoil Proton Detector (RPD) that measures the time of flight of the recoil protons using two scintillator barrels. COMPASS is connected to the M2 beam line of the SPS which can deliver secondary hadron beams with a momentum of up to 300 GeV/c and a maximum intensity of 5 \u2022 10 7 s \u22121 . The negative hadron beam that was used for the analyses presented here has a momentum of 190 GeV/c and consists of 96.8 % \u03c0 \u2212 , 2.4 % K \u2212 , and 0.8 % p at the target. Two ChErenkov Differential counters with Achromatic Ring focus (CEDAR) upstream of the target are used to identify the incoming beam particles.",

Events with charged particle trajectories outside the spectrometer acceptance and those, where the beam particle traversed the target unscattered, were vetoed. In the offline data selection events were required to have a well-defined primary interaction vertex inside the target volume. Diffractive events were enriched by an exclusivity cut around the nominal beam energy.

The X \u2212 with quantum numbers J PC and spin projection M \u03b5 is assumed to decay into a di-pion resonance, the so-called isobar, and a bachelor pion. The isobar has spin S and a relative orbital angular momentum L with respect to \u03c0 \u2212 bachelor . A partial wave is thus defined by J PC M \u03b5 [isobar]L, where \u03b5 = \u00b11 is the reflectivity [5]. The spin-density matrix is determined by extended maximum likelihood fits performed in 20 MeV/c 2 wide bins of the three-pion invariant mass m X . In these fits no assumption is made on the produced resonances X \u2212 other than that their production strengths are constant within a m X bin. The PWA model includes five \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 isobars [2]: (\u03c0\u03c0) S-wave , \u03c1(770), f 0 (980), f 2 (1270), and \u03c1 3 (1690). They were described using relativistic Breit-Wigner line shape functions including Blatt-Weisskopf barrier penetration factors [6]. For the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 S-wave we use the parametrization from [7] with the f 0 (980) subtracted from the elastic \u03c0\u03c0 amplitude and added as a separate Breit-Wigner resonance. In total the wave set consists of 52 waves plus an incoherent isotropic background wave. Mostly positive reflectivity waves are needed to describe the data which corresponds to production with natural parity exchange. A rank-two spin-density matrix was used in order to account for spin-flip and spin-non-flip amplitudes at the target vertex.",

This is consistent with the results obtained from a PWA of the pilot-run data taken with a Pb target [2]. The bump around 1.2 GeV/c 2 is still being investigated.

            "text": "Compared to the total number of events the intensity of the spin-exotic 1 \u2212+ wave is on the percent level. In order to extract such small contributions reliably via PWA an excellent Monte-Carlo description of the spectrometer acceptance is required. In this regard the analysis of the isospin-partner final state \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 , although having a significantly lower reconstruction efficiency, is interesting [9]. Since the reconstruction of the \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 (\"charged\") and the \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 (\"neutral\") final states relies on different parts of the apparatus, the results can be used for internal consistency checks. By na\u00efve application of just isospin Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, one expects that an isovector state should decay  equally into charged and neutral (3\u03c0) \u2212 states, if the decay proceeds via an isobar with isospin 1, whereas for an isoscalar isobar the intensity in the neutral decay channel should be half of that in the charged one. This pattern is observed in the data. Some examples are shown in Fig. 2. The two data sets are normalized to the narrow a 2 (1302) resonance in the 2 ++ 1 + [\u03c1\u03c0]D wave. Even though no acceptance correction was applied yet to the neutral-channel data, the intensity sums of all \u03c1\u03c0 waves are in good agreement, whereas the intensity sums of all f 2 \u03c0 waves exhibit the expected suppression factor of two in the neutral channel. This is also true for the major waves (not shown) as well as for small-intensity waves like the two 4 ++ waves shown in Fig. 2c and d. These waves contain the a 4 (2040) resonance and illustrate the ability of COMPASS to reconstruct resonances even in waves with percent-level intensity.",

However, the resonant nature of the observed signals is still controversial [14]. COMPASS performed an analysis of the \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b7 \u2032 final state which is reconstructed from the decay chain \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b7, \u03b7 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3. This is illustrated in Fig. 3 which shows the \u03b7(548) peak in the \u03b3\u03b3 invariant mass spectrum. The reconstructed \u03b7 are then combined with a \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 pair yielding a narrow \u03b7 \u2032 (958) peak in the respective invariant mass distribution. The final \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b7 \u2032 invariant mass spectrum contains 35 000 events and exhibits a peak from the a 2 (1320) resonance. The performed PWA [15] follows previous analyses and includes S, P, and D waves with M \u2264 1 and both natural and unnatural parity exchange. In addition a 4 ++ 1 + and a background wave were included. The top row of Fig. 4 shows the intensities of the major waves. The 2 ++ 1 + (D + ) wave exhibits a peak of the a 2 (1320) and the 4 ++ 1 + (G + ) wave a clear signal of the a 4 (2040). The most intense wave, however, is the spin-exotic 1 \u2212+ 1 + (P + ) wave which has a broad structure around 1.6 GeV/c 2 , consistent with previous experiments.

            "text": "Although there are no spin-exotic strange mesons, because these states are not G-or C-parity eigenstates, the spectrum of strange mesons is still interesting as it contains many states that need confirmation. There are also open questions about the interpretation of some states. Since most of the available data are from the 70s and 80s, COMPASS takes the opportunity to remeasure some final states with a state-of-the-art apparatus. An interesting channel is the K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 final state which was studied by several experiments in the past [16]. The measurement [17] exploits the fact that the negative hadron beam of the M2 beam line contains a 2.4 % admixture of K \u2212 . These beam kaons were tagged by two CEDAR detectors located 30 m upstream of the target. The final-state kaons were identified using the RICH detector. After all cuts a sample of 270 000 K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 events was obtained. Figure 5 shows the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 invariant mass spectrum which exhibits structures from \u03c1(770), f 0 (980), and f 2 (1270). The corresponding \u03c0 + K \u2212 spectrum shows peaks from K * (892) and K * 2 (1430). Also the m K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 distribution shows significant structures. A PWA using a model with 19 waves plus a background wave together with a rank-2 spin-density matrix was performed in 20 MeV/c 2 wide mass bins. Some of the most prominent waves are shown in Fig. 6. A clear K * 2 (1430) peak is seen in the 2 + 1 + [K * (892)\u03c0]D wave. The 1 + 0 + [K * (892)\u03c0]S wave shows two peaks that probably belong to the K 1 (1270) and the K 1 (1400). As expected the K 1 (1400) peak is absent in the corresponding 1 + 0 + [\u03c1K]S wave (not  shown). Similarly the broad structure in the 2 \u2212 0 + [K * 2 (1430)\u03c0]S wave, which could be due to K 2 (1770) and K 2 (1820), becomes narrower in the 2 \u2212 0 + [ f 2 (1270)K]S wave (not shown). More information on these and other states will be extracted by fitting the mass dependence of the spin-density matrix.",

            "text": "First partial-wave analyses of the large data set of diffractive dissociation events that COMPASS has collected show interesting results in various channels. Structures around 1.6 GeV/c 2 are observed in spin-exotic J PC = 1 \u2212+ waves in the \u03c1\u03c0 and the \u03c0\u03b7 \u2032 decay channels. The resonant nature of these bumps, however, still has to be verified by massdependent fits. The same is true for some structures seen in the K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 final state. With further improved analyses COMPASS will make a significant contribution to the study of the light-quark meson spectrum.",
