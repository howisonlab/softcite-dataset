Events are selected by requiring the presence of an electron-muon pair with large transverse momentum p T (\u00b5 \u00b1 e \u2213 ) > 30 GeV, and no associated charged particles detected from the same vertex. The 8 TeV results are combined with the previous 7 TeV results (obtained for 5.05 fb \u22121 of data). In the signal region, 13 (2) events are observed over an expected background of 3.9 \u00b1 0.6 (0.84 \u00b1 0.15) events for 8 (7) TeV, resulting in a combined excess of 3.4\u03c3 over the background-only hypothesis. The observed yields and kinematic distributions are compatible with the standard model prediction for exclusive and quasi-exclusive \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 W + W \u2212 production. Upper limits on the anomalous quartic gauge coupling operators a W 0,C (dimension-6) and f M 0,1,2,3 (dimension-8), the most stringent to date, are derived from the measured dilepton transverse momentum spectrum.",

Such deviations from the SM may be quantified through anomalous quartic gauge couplings (AQGC) of operators of dimension-6 or -8 [6,7]. Specific models including anomalous gauge-Higgs couplings [8,9], as well as composite Higgs [9][10][11] or warped extra dimensions [10] scenarios, will also result in deviations from the SM predictions for the \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 W + W \u2212 (differential and/or integrated) cross sections. Prior to the LHC, limits on AQGC were obtained through triboson (Z\u03b3\u03b3 and W + W \u2212 \u03b3) production, and WW \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 scattering at LEP [12][13][14][15][16][17][18], and through \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 W + W \u2212 scattering at the Tevatron [19]. Anomalous quartic gauge couplings have been explored at the LHC through triboson (W\u03b3\u03b3 or WV \u03b3, where V is a W or Z boson) production [20,21], and same-charge WW \u2192 WW scattering [22,23].",

The signal topology considered is pp \u2192 p ( * ) W + W \u2212 p ( * ) , where the p ( * ) indicates that the final state protons either remain intact (\"exclusive\" or \"elastic\" production), or dissociate into an undetected system (\"quasi-exclusive\" or \"proton dissociation\" production). The W + W \u2212 \u2192 \u00b5 \u00b1 e \u2213 (plus undetected neutrinos) channel is the final state used to search for a signal, as the backgrounds due to Drell-Yan (DY) and \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 + \u2212 production are smaller than in the same-flavor final states. Events in which one or both of the W bosons decay into a tau lepton, with a subsequent decay of the tau to a muon or electron and neutrinos, are also included in the signal. In contrast to exclusive production, inclusive W + W \u2212 production is always accompanied by underlying event activity originating from semihard multiple-parton interactions and from softer \"spectator\" partons at forward rapidities. This will almost always result in the production of additional detectable charged particles from the \u00b5 \u00b1 e \u2213 vertex. The experimental signature for the signal therefore consists of a muon-electron pair with large transverse momentum p T (\u00b5 \u00b1 e \u2213 ), the vector p T sum of the pair, originating from a common primary vertex with no additional charged particles detected.",

In contrast, effective field theories can be constructed to quantify potential deviations from the SM by introducing genuine AQGCs through dimension-6 operators that are not related to the SM triple or quartic couplings [26]. By imposing U(1) EM and global custodial SU(2) C symmetries, and further requiring charge-conjugation and parity to be separately conserved, two such operators are allowed with couplings denoted a W 0 /\u039b 2 and a W C /\u039b 2 , where \u039b is the energy scale for new physics.

Within the field volume are the silicon pixel and strip tracker, the crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) and the brass-scintillator hadronic calorimeter (HCAL). Muons are measured in gas-ionization detectors embedded in the steel flux-return yoke of the solenoid. The momentum resolution for electrons with p T \u223c 45 GeV from Z \u2192 ee decays ranges from 1.7% for nonshowering electrons in the barrel region to 4.5% for showering electrons in the endcaps [37]. The calorimeter cells are grouped in projective towers, of granularity \u2206\u03b7\u00d7\u2206\u03c6 = 0.087\u00d70.087 (where \u03c6 is the azimuthal angle in radians) in the pseudorapidity region |\u03b7| < 1.5, and increasing to 0.175\u00d70.175 in the region 3 < |\u03b7| < 5. The silicon tracker covers a range of |\u03b7| < 2.4, and consists of three layers made of 66 million 100\u00d7150 \u00b5m 2 pixels followed by ten microstrip layers, with strips of pitch between 80 and 180 \u00b5m. The silicon tracker is used to detect charged particles as tracks. Muons are measured in the window |\u03b7| < 2.4, with detection planes made of three technologies: drift tubes, cathode strip chambers, and resistive-plate chambers. Thanks to the strong magnetic field, 3.8 T, and to the high granularity of the silicon tracker, the transverse momentum, p T , of the muons matched to silicon tracks is measured with a resolution better than 1.5%, for p T smaller than 100 GeV . The resolution of z 0 , the point of closest approach of the track to the beam direction z, for a 1 (10) GeV pion is 100-300 \u00b5m (30-60 \u00b5m) in the central region and 300-1000 \u00b5m (60-150 \u00b5m) in the forward region [38]. The ECAL provides coverage in a range of |\u03b7| < 1.48 in a barrel region, and 1.48 < |\u03b7| < 3 in two endcap regions (EE). A preshower detector consisting of two planes of silicon sensors interleaved with a total of 3 radiation lengths of lead is located in front of the EE. The first level of the CMS trigger system, composed of custom hardware processors, uses information from the calorimeters and muon detectors to select (in less than 4 \u00b5s) the most interesting events. The high-level trigger processor farm further decreases the event rate from 100 kHz to a few hundred Hz, before data storage.",

For tt production the yields are normalized to the next-to-next-to-leadingorder (NNLO) plus next-to-next-to-leading-logarithmic cross section prediction obtained with Top++2.0 [45]. For inclusive diboson and W+jets production the yields are normalized to the NNLO and next-to-leading-order cross section predictions, respectively, and are obtained with mcfm v6.6 [46]. Inclusive Drell-Yan samples are simulated with powheg v1.0 [47][48][49]. The outgoing partons from the matrix element calculation in both Mad-Graph and powheg are matched to parton showers from the pythia v6.4.26 [50] with the Z2* tune [51] for the analysis of the 8 TeV data and with the Z2 tune [52] for the analysis of the 7 TeV data. The simulated inclusive W + W \u2212 sample does not include events generated in diffractive topologies, in which one of the incoming protons remains intact. While diffractive W + W \u2212 production is expected to be small compared to the rate of inclusive W + W \u2212 production, the mean multiplicity of charged particles in diffractive events will be smaller, thus enhancing the contribution of diffractive production to the exclusive signal region. The contribution from diffractive W + W \u2212 production is simulated with pompyt v2.6.1 [53], using diffractive parton distribution functions obtained from the H1 fit B to diffractive deep inelastic scattering data [54]. In practice, the diffractive W + W \u2212 background may be suppressed by a \"gap survival probability\" factor, representing the effect of rescattering interactions that will lead to additional hadronic activity in the event. As this factor is not precisely predicted or measured at LHC energies [55], a very conservative 100% gap survival probability (meaning no correction due to rescattering interactions) is assumed. Gluon-induced central exclusive production of W + W \u2212 pairs, with an additional \"screening\" gluon emission to cancel the color flow, is expected to be heavily suppressed [56] and is neglected in the current analysis. Electroweak production (at order \u03b1 5 EW or \u03b1 6 EW for real W + W \u2212 emission) of W + W \u2212 pairs, including WW \u2192 WW scattering, is also not included in the simulated inclusive W + W \u2212 sample. We use a sample generated with MadGraph, which describes well the electroweak production of Zqq (where 'q' indicates a quark jet) at \u221a s = 8 TeV [57], to esti-",

Primary vertices are identified by clustering tracks according to a deterministic annealing algorithm, and subsequently performing a fit to the clustered tracks [38]. The \"tight\" muon identification includes requirements on the minimum number of muon detector planes hit, the minimum number of hits in the pixel detector and of layers hit in the silicon strip detector, the goodness of the global fit to the muon track, and the transverse impact parameter with respect to the primary vertex. An additional requirement that the longitudinal impact parameter be at most 5 mm is added for the 8 TeV analysis and was not present in the 7 TeV analysis. This requirement is added to suppress cosmic muons, muons from decays in flight of charged mesons, and tracks from pileup. The \"medium\" identification criteria for electrons combines information from the ECAL, HCAL, and silicon tracker. This includes selections on the azimuthal angle and pseudorapidity differences between the tracks and ECAL deposits associated to the electron candidate, the ratio of energy deposited in the HCAL to that in the ECAL, the shower shape of the ECAL deposits, and the compatibility of the energy deposited in the ECAL with the momentum of the associated track. The efficiency of the \"tight\" muon identification is estimated to be \u226596% for muons with p T > 20 GeV, with a hadron misidentification probability of <0.5%. The efficiency of the \"medium\" electron identification rises from \u223c60% for electrons with p T = 20 GeV, reaching a plateau at \u226580% for electrons with p T > 55 GeV . The misidentification probability is estimated to be <4% for the \"medium\" electron identification. In addition, the electrons are required to satisfy relative isolation criteria, based on the global particle-flow algorithm [61,62]. The invariant dilepton mass is also required to satisfy m( + \u2212 ) > 20 GeV in order to remove any potential background due to low-mass resonances, which is particularly relevant in the \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 and e + e \u2212 final states.",

These consist in requiring a small acoplanarity, |1 \u2212 \u2206\u03c6( + \u2212 )/\u03c0| < 0.01 where \u2206\u03c6( + \u2212 ) is the difference in azimuthal angle between the two leptons, and an invariant mass incompatible with Z \u2192 + \u2212 decays (m( + \u2212 ) < 70 GeV or m( + \u2212 ) > 106 GeV). The leptons from elastic pp \u2192 p + \u2212 p events have small acoplanarity because the very small virtuality of the exchanged photons results in a dilepton pair produced with p T ( + \u2212 ) \u223c 0. The acoplanarity and invariant mass requirements result in a sample expected to contain a negligible contribution from inclusive backgrounds, but some contamination from \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 + \u2212 events where one or both of the protons dissociate. In this control sample we find a deficit in the data compared to the theoretical prediction for events with zero additional tracks associated to the dilepton vertex (figure 2). We have verified that this is due to the fact that the efficiency of the additional-track veto is overestimated in the simulation. To numerically calculate the data-to-simulation ratio, we use a tighter acoplanarity requirement (|1 \u2212 \u2206\u03c6( + \u2212 )/\u03c0| < 0.001, corresponding to >3\u03c3 in terms of the experimental resolution on the acoplanarity) to further reduce the contamination from \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 + \u2212 events where one or both of the protons dissociate. The data-to-simulation ratio is 0.63 \u00b1 0.04 in the \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 channel and 0.63 \u00b1 0.07 in the e + e \u2212 channel. By comparing the shapes of the \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 + \u2212 distributions we find a good data-to-theory agreement, apart from the overall difference in normalization (figures 2 and 3). We therefore apply this ratio, averaged over the \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 and e + e \u2212 samples, as a track veto efficiency correction to the \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 W + W \u2212 signal.",

Figure 4 shows the dilepton invariant mass distribution for events with no additional tracks at the dilepton vertex. The theoretical double-dissociation contribution (blue dotted line on top of the sum of all other simulated data samples in figure 4) is much larger than the data, because the value of the gap survival probability factor is too high in the calculations, whereas at high dilepton mass the data are consistent with a very low survival probability for this contribution. For a 100% gap survival probability in both single-and double-dissociation processes, the scale factor to correct the elastic prediction would be F = 7.71 \u00b1 0.57, by applying the same procedure described above but using the single-and double-dissociation simulated samples.

We combine the 7 and 8 TeV results, treating all systematic uncertainties as fully uncorrelated between the two measurements, with the exception of the 5% uncertainty from the use of the equivalent photon approximation in the generation of signal samples, which is treated as fully correlated between the two JHEP08 2016  analyses.

In the 7 TeV analysis, where the number of expected and observed events was near zero, the inclusion of systematic uncertainties in the background estimate resulted in a shortening of the 95% confidence interval. Therefore a conservative procedure of integrating the systematic uncertainties out, reproducing the method advocated by Cousins and Highland [67], was used. In the 8 TeV analysis and in the 7+8 TeV combination, no such effect is observed, therefore the systematic uncertainties are included as log-normal nuisance parameters in the limit calculation. As in the case of the combined significance calculations, the systematic uncertainties are treated as uncorrelated between the two data sets, except for the EPA uncertainty, which is fully correlated. Table 3 summarizes all of the limits on the dimension-6 and dimension-8 AQGC parameters obtained from the 7 and 8 TeV \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 W + W \u2212 data separately, and from the combination of the two. The 7 TeV dimension-6 results are taken from ref. [5], and translated into the dimension-8 formalism as described in section 2, using eq. (1). For these limits all parameters except the one shown are fixed to zero (the value expected in the standard model). The 8 TeV results are an improvement over previously published values with \u039b cutoff = 500 GeV [5,19,21], of which the CMS 7 TeV limits of 1.5 \u00d7 10 \u22124 GeV \u22122 and 5 \u00d7 10 \u22124 GeV \u22122 on a W 0 /\u039b 2 and a W C /\u039b 2 , respectively, are the most stringent. These limits are also approximately two orders of magnitude more stringent than those obtained at LEP [12][13][14][15][16][17][18], where unitarity was approximately preserved without form factors, due to the lower \u221a s of e + e \u2212 collisions. By combining the 7 and 8 TeV data sets, we find upper limits at 95% CL that are \u223c10% more restrictive than the 8 TeV results alone, for the case of a dipole form factor with \u039b cutoff = 500 GeV.",

In the signal region with p T (\u00b5 \u00b1 e \u2213 ) > 30 GeV and no additional charged particles associated with the \u00b5 \u00b1 e \u2213 vertex, we observe 13 (2) events with an expected background of 3.9 \u00b1 0.6 (0.84 \u00b1 0.15) events in the 8 (7) TeV data. The observed yields and kinematic distributions are consistent with the SM prediction, with a combined significance over the background-only hypothesis of 3.4\u03c3. No significant deviations from the SM are observed in the p T (\u00b5 \u00b1 e \u2213 ) distribution, and the combined 7+8 TeV limits are interpreted in terms of improved constraints on dimension-6 and dimension-8 anomalous quartic gauge operator couplings.

The areas outside the solid contours are excluded by each measurement at 95% CL.
