            "text": "The violation of CP symmetry, i.e., the noninvariance of fundamental forces under the combined action of the charge conjugation (C) and parity (P) transformations, is well established in the K 0 and B 0 meson systems [1][2][3][4]. Recent results from the LHCb collaboration have also provided evidence for CP violation in the decays of D 0 mesons [5]. Consequently, there now remains only one neutral heavy meson system, the B 0 s , where CP violation has not yet been seen. All current experimental measurements of CP violation in the quark flavor sector are well described by the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa mechanism [6,7] which is embedded in the framework of the standard model (SM). However, it is believed that the size of CP violation in the SM is not sufficient to account for the asymmetry between matter and antimatter in the Universe [8]; hence, additional sources of CP violation are being searched for as manifestations of physics beyond the SM.",

            "text": "LHCb is a forward spectrometer covering the pseudorapidity range 2 < < 5, designed to perform flavor physics measurements at the LHC. A detailed description of the detector can be found in Ref. [17]. The analysis is based on pp collision data collected in the first half of 2011 at a center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 0:35 fb \u00c01 . The polarity of the LHCb magnetic field is reversed from time to time in order to partially cancel the effects of instrumental charge asymmetries, and about 0:15 fb \u00c01 were acquired with one polarity and 0:20 fb \u00c01 with the opposite polarity. The LHCb trigger system comprises a hardware trigger followed by a high level trigger (HLT) implemented in software. The hadronic hardware trigger selects high transverse energy clusters in the hadronic calorimeter. A transverse energy threshold of 3.5 GeV has been adopted for the data set under study. The HLT first selects events with at least one large transverse momentum track characterized by a large impact parameter, and then uses algorithms to reconstruct D and B meson decays. Most of the events containing the decays under study have been acquired by means of a dedicated two-body HLT selection. To discriminate between signal and background events, this trigger selection imposes requirements on the quality of the online-reconstructed tracks ( 2 per degree of freedom), their transverse momenta (p T ), and their impact parameters (d IP , defined as the distance between the reconstructed trajectory of the track and the pp collision vertex), the distance of closest approach of the decay products of the B meson candidate (d CA ), its transverse momentum (p B T ), its impact parameter (d B IP ), and the decay time in its rest frame (t , calculated assuming the decay into \u00fe \u00c0 ). Only B candidates within the invariant mass range 4:7-5:9 GeV=c 2 are accepted. The mass hypothesis is conventionally chosen to select all charmless two-body B decays using the same criteria.",

K decays, a tighter selection is needed because the probability for a b quark to decay as B 0 s ! K is about 14 times smaller than that to decay as B 0 ! K [18], and consequently a stronger rejection of combinatorial background (Comb. bkg.) is required. The two samples passing the event selection are then subdivided into different final states using the particle identification (PID) provided by the two ring-imaging Cherenkov (RICH) detectors. Again two sets of PID selection criteria are applied: a loose set optimized for the measurement of A CP \u00f0B 0 ! K\u00de and a tight set for that of A CP \u00f0B 0 s ! K\u00de. To estimate the background from other two-body B decays with a misidentified pion or kaon (cross-feed background), the relative efficiencies of the RICH PID selection criteria must be determined. The high production rate of charged D \u00c3 mesons at the LHC and the kinematic characteristics of the D \u00c3\u00fe ! D 0 \u00f0K \u00c0 \u00fe \u00de \u00fe decay chain make such events an appropriate calibration sample for the PID of kaons and pions. In addition, for calibrating the response of the RICH system for protons, a sample of \u00c3 ! p \u00c0 decays is used. PID information is not used to select either sample, as the selection of pure final states can be realized by means of kinematic criteria alone. The production and decay kinematics of the D 0 ! K \u00c0 \u00fe and \u00c3 ! p \u00c0 channels differ from those of the B decays under study. Since the RICH PID information is momentum dependent, the distributions obtained from calibration samples are reweighted according to the momentum distributions of B daughter tracks observed in data.",

The quantity A I \u00f0K\u00de does not change its value by reversing the magnetic field, as the difference in the interaction lengths seen by the positive and negative particles for opposite polarities is small. By contrast, A R \u00f0K\u00de changes its sign when the magnetic field polarity is reversed. The factor \u00f0K\u00de accounts for different signal yields in the data sets with opposite polarities, due to the different values of the corresponding integrated luminosities and to changing trigger conditions in the course of the run. It is estimated by using the yields of the largest decay mode, i.e., B 0 ! K, determined from the mass fits applied to the two data sets separately. We obtain \u00f0K\u00de \u00bc \u00c8\u00bdN up \u00f0B 0 ! K\u00de; N down \u00f0B 0 ! K\u00de \u00bc \u00c00:202 AE 0:011, where ''up'' and ''down'' denote the direction of the main component of the dipole field. The instrumental asymmetries for the final state K are measured from data using large samples of tagged D \u00c3\u00fe ! D 0 \u00f0K \u00c0 \u00fe \u00de \u00fe and D \u00c3\u00fe ! D 0 \u00f0K \u00c0 K \u00fe \u00de \u00fe decays, and untagged D 0 ! K \u00c0 \u00fe decays. The combination of the integrated raw asymmetries of all these decay modes is necessary to disentangle the various contributions to the raw asymmetries of each mode, notably including the K instrumental asymmetry as well as that of the pion from the D \u00c3\u00fe decay, and the production asymmetries of the D \u00c3\u00fe and D 0 mesons. In order to determine the raw asymmetry of the D 0 ! K decay, a maximum likelihood fit to the K \u00c0 \u00fe and K \u00fe \u00c0 mass spectra is performed. For the decays D \u00c3\u00fe ! D 0 \u00f0K \u00c0 \u00fe \u00de \u00fe and D \u00c3\u00fe ! D 0 \u00f0K \u00c0 K \u00fe \u00de \u00fe , we perform maximum likelihood fits to the discriminating variable m \u00bc M D \u00c3 \u00c0 M D 0 , where M D \u00c3 and M D 0 are the reconstructed D \u00c3 and D 0 invariant masses, respectively. Approximately 54 \u00c2 10 6 D 0 ! K \u00c0 \u00fe decays, 7:5 \u00c2 10 6 D \u00c3\u00fe !D 0 \u00f0K \u00c0 \u00fe \u00de \u00fe and 1:1\u00c210 6 D \u00c3\u00fe ! D 0 \u00f0K \u00c0 K \u00fe \u00de \u00fe decays are used. The mass distributions are shown in Figs. 2(a)-2(c). The D 0 ! K \u00c0 \u00fe signal component is modeled as the sum of two Gaussian functions with the common mean convolved with a function accounting for final state radiation [19], on top of an exponential combinatorial background. The D \u00c3\u00fe ! D 0 \u00f0K \u00c0 \u00fe \u00de \u00fe and D \u00c3\u00fe ! D 0 \u00f0K \u00c0 K \u00fe \u00de \u00fe signal components are modeled as the sum of two Gaussian functions convolved with a function taking account of the asymmetric shape of the measured distribution [5]. The background is described by an empirical function of the form 1 \u00c0 e \u00c0\u00f0m\u00c0m 0 \u00de= , where m 0 and are free parameters. Using the current world average of the integrated CP asymmetry for the D 0 ! K \u00c0 K \u00fe decay [21] and neglecting CP violation in the Cabibbo-favored D 0 ! K \u00c0 \u00fe decay [22], from the raw yield asymmetries returned by the mass fits we determine A I \u00f0K\u00de \u00bc \u00f0\u00c01:0 AE 0:2\u00de \u00c210 \u00c02 and A R \u00f0K\u00de \u00bc \u00f0\u00c01:8 AE 0:2\u00de \u00c2 10 \u00c03 , where the uncertainties are statistical only. The possible existence of a B 0 -\" B 0 production asymmetry is studied by reconstructing a sample of B 0 ! J=c K \u00c30 decays. CP violation in b ! c \" cs transitions, which is predicted in the SM to be at the 10 \u00c03 level [23], is neglected. The raw asymmetry A raw \u00f0B 0 !J=c K \u00c30 \u00de is determined from an unbinned maximum likelihood fit to the J=c \u00f0 \u00fe \u00c0 \u00deK \u00c30 \u00f0K \u00fe \u00c0 \u00de and J=c \u00f0 \u00fe \u00c0 \u00de \" K \u00c30 \u00f0K \u00c0 \u00fe \u00de mass spectra. The signal mass peak is modeled as the sum of two Gaussian functions with a common mean, whereas the combinatorial background is modeled by an exponential. The data sample contains approximately 25 400 B 0 ! J=c K \u00c30 decays. The mass distribution is shown in Fig. 2(d). To determine the production asymmetry we need to correct for the presence of instrumental asymmetries. Once the necessary corrections are applied, we obtain a value for the B 0 production asymmetry A P \u00f0B 0 \u00de \u00bc 0:010 AE 0:013, where the uncertainty is statistical only.",

Since the B 0 s meson has no valence quarks in common with those of the incident protons, its production asymmetry is expected to be smaller than for the B 0 , an expectation that is supported by hadronization models as discussed in Ref. [24]. Even conservatively assuming a value of the production asymmetry equal to that for the B 0 , owing to the small value of s the effect of A P \u00f0B 0 s \u00de is negligible, and we find A \u00c1 \u00f0B 0 s ! K\u00de \u00bc 0:010 AE 0:002. The systematic uncertainties on the asymmetries fall into the following main categories, related to (a) PID calibration, (b) modeling of the signal and background components in the maximum likelihood fits, and (c) instrumental and production asymmetries. Knowledge of PID efficiencies is necessary in this analysis to compute the number of cross-feed background events affecting the mass fit of the B 0 ! K and B 0 s ! K decay channels. In order to estimate the impact of imperfect PID calibration, we perform unbinned maximum likelihood fits after having altered the number of cross-feed background events present in the relevant mass spectra according to the systematic uncertainties affecting the PID efficiencies. An estimate of the uncertainty due to possible imperfections in the description of the final state radiation is determined by varying, over a wide range, the amount of emitted radiation [19] in the signal line shape parametrization. The possibility of an incorrect description of the core distribution in the signal mass model is investigated by replacing the single Gaussian with the sum of two Gaussian functions with a common mean. The impact of additional three-body B decays in the K spectrum, not accounted for in the baseline fit-namely B ! where one pion is missed in the reconstruction and another is misidentified as a kaon-is investigated. The mass line shape of this background component is determined from Monte Carlo simulations, and then the fit is repeated after having modified the baseline parametrization accordingly. For the modeling of the combinatorial background component, the fit is repeated using a first-order polynomial. Finally, for the case of the cross-feed backgrounds, two distinct systematic uncertainties are estimated: one due to a relative bias in the mass scale of the simulated distributions with respect to the signal distributions in data, and another accounting for the difference in mass resolution between simulation and data. All the shifts from the relevant baseline values are accounted for as systematic uncertainties. Differences in the kinematic properties of B decays with respect to the charm control samples, as well as different triggers and offline selections, are taken into account by introducing a systematic uncertainty on the values of the A \u00c1 corrections. This uncertainty dominates the total systematic uncertainty related to the instrumental and production asymmetries, and can be reduced in future measurements with a better understanding of the dependence of such asymmetries on the kinematics of selected signal and control samples. The systematic uncertainties for A CP \u00f0B 0 ! K\u00de and A CP \u00f0B 0 s ! K\u00de are summarized in Table II.",
