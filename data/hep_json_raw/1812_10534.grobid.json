The measurement uses the tt all-jets final state. A kinematic fit is performed to reconstruct the decay of the tt system and suppress the multijet background. Using the ideogram method, the top quark mass (m t ) is determined, simultaneously constraining an additional jet energy scale factor (JSF). The resulting value of m t = 172.34 \u00b1 0.20 (stat+JSF) \u00b1 0.70 (syst) GeV is in good agreement with previous measurements. In addition, a combined measurement that uses the tt lepton+jets and all-jets final states is presented, using the same mass extraction method, and provides an m t measurement of 172.26 \u00b1 0.07 (stat+JSF) \u00b1 0.61 (syst) GeV. This is the first combined m t extraction from the lepton+jets and all-jets channels through a single likelihood function.",

Precise measurements of m t can be used to test the internal consistency of the SM [3][4][5] and to search for new physical phenomena. Since the top quark dominates the higher-order corrections to the Higgs boson mass, a precise m t determination is crucial to put constraints on the stability of the electroweak vacuum [6,7].",

Each tt event can be classified through the decays of the W bosons. Events in the all-jets final state correspond to those that have both W bosons decaying further into qq pairs, while events in the lepton+jets final state have one W boson decaying to a charged lepton and a neutrino. e-mail: cms-publication-committee-chair@cern.ch This paper presents a measurement of m t obtained in the tt all-jets decay channel using proton-proton (pp) collision data taken in 2016 by the CMS experiment at a center-ofmass energy of \u221a s = 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 .

The most precise one of these has been obtained by CMS at \u221a s = 8 TeV, resulting in a mass of m t = 172.32\u00b10. 25  The top quark mass has been measured for the first time with pp data at \u221a s = 13 TeV, using the lepton+jets channel [17], yielding a value of m t = 172.25 \u00b1 0.08 (stat+JSF) \u00b1 0.62 (syst) GeV. A measurement using both tt all-jets and lepton+jets events is presented here. This is possible since the two measurements use the same mass extraction method, so a single likelihood can be used, rather than just combining the two results statistically. With this approach, no assumptions on correlations between different uncertainties of the measurements have to be made. This is the first report of a combined m t measurement in the lepton+jets and all-jets final states using a single likelihood function.",

Underlying event measurements are used to tune the parameters of all models [32,33]. The largest shifts induced by the variations are assigned as the CR uncertainty.

The difference between the results obtained with the two generators is \u03b4m hyb t = + 0.31 \u00b1 0.52 for the hybrid method in the all-jets channel.

            "text": "The systematic uncertainties are evaluated as described above for the all-jets channel. For the pseudo-experiments, the systematic uncertainty sources are varied simultaneously for both channels. An exception are uncertainties that only affect a single channel. These uncertainty sources are only varied for the corresponding channel. For the all-jets channel, these are the background and trigger uncertainties. In addition, uncertainties specific to the lepton+jets channel are introduced, including the background and trigger uncertainties, as well as the uncertainties arising from the lepton isolation and identification criteria, and are described in Ref.  Fig. 4 Difference between extracted and generated top quark masses (upper panel) and JSFs (lower panel) for different input masses and JSFs after the single-channel calibrations for the combined measurement. The values are extracted using the 2D method [17]. The complete list of uncertainties is shown in Table 2. A comparison of the hybrid mass uncertainties can be found in Table 3 for the all-jets and lepton+jets channels as well as for the combination. In general, the uncertainties for the combination are smaller than those for the all-jets channel and are close to the lepton+jets uncertainties, as expected because the combination is dominated by this channel. The total uncertainty for the combination is slightly smaller than that for the lepton+jets channel. The combined measurement yields for the 1D and hybrid fits. The likelihood contours for \u22122\u0394 ln L = 2.3, corresponding to the 68% confidence level, in the m t -JSF plane are shown in Fig. 5 for the hybrid measurement results for the all-jets and lepton+jets channels, as well as for the combination. Additionally, the likelihood profiles are displayed as a function of m t . Both channels are in statistical agreement with each other. The result of the combination is closer to the lepton+jets channel, as expected. Just as for the single-channel results, the hybrid measurement provides the best precision and is considered the main result. This is the first top quark mass measurement using the tt lepton+jets and all-jets final states combined in a single likelihood function. The largest uncertainty contribution is related to the modeling of color reconnection, as it was observed for the all-jets channel and the lepton+jets channel before using the same CR models. Accordingly, the quoted systematic uncertainty is larger than those reported in the most precise combination reported by the CMS Collaboration [12], and comparable to the value reported by the ATLAS Collaboration [50].",
