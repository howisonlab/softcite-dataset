The CDF collaboration conducted such a study for the mean transverse momentum p T , as illustrated on Fig 1. An important raise of p T is seen as a function of multiplicity. This can result from several elementary multiple interactions occurring in parallel in growing multiplicity events. In these events, one can also expects non trivial phenomenon, such as collective effects, as mentioned later. Thus, there is no theoretical clear picture for the explanation of p T versus multiplicity, but multiple interactions clearly play an important role. Another feature that helps to understand the importance of multiple interactions, is the fact that, for protonproton collisions, the jet cross section computed in the framework of perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (pQCD), becomes larger than the total cross section:",

These event generator is based on pQCD and assume the factorization scheme. At the time the CDF data, Run I, was released, none of the models were able to describe the data [6]. After improving its treatment of multiple interactions, PYTHIA finally describes better these data with the tune\u00c2 (p \u22a5 = 1.5) [4]. A good understanding of high multiplicity phenomena is thus important to completely describe events with hard and soft components, and possible interactions between the two. It is to be noted that collective effects in proton-proton collisions can also contribute to explaining this observable, as for instance accounted in the EPOS event generator [7].",

Hard processes can be understood in the framework of pQCD, where in the limit of high momentum transfer Q 2 , a hard component (2 \u2192 2 or 2 \u2192 1 processes) can be factorized out from the soft component, as predicted by the factorization theorem [9,10]. J/\u03c8 are very particular among the hard probes, because they first imply the production of a massive charm quark-antiquark pair, followed by its binding into a charmonia (cc) state. Nowadays, the exact charmonia production scheme is not clear and is debated within the community (for reviews on this aspect, see [1,2]). Furthermore, no models describe the underlying event associated to a J/\u03c8 production, and one needs to be aware of this lack of description, when dealing with event generators. This problem was for instance raised in February 2010 during a workshop on quarkonia production at CERN [11]. New observables are then needed to start understanding and constraining the interplay of soft and hard aspects of proton-proton collisions, the importance of multiple interactions in the production of hard processes and the possibility of new phenomena such as collective effects.",

Quite unexpected is the shape of the strongly decreasing curves we observe, especially in the most modern tunes. It is to be noted that the multiple interactions scheme in PYTHIA is still under study and the production of quarkonia is not well constrained, especially with the final state radiation, and the production mechanism.",

One can also think to look at different p T classes of the J/\u03c8 to look for eventual modification of the trend looking at hardest particles. Finally, in a more general study, we would recommend to look at any observable, one could think of, as a function of multiplicity. Taking hadrons or jets for example, one then could use another event generator than PYTHIA, with a different feature of multiple interactions, and collective phenomenon, and here, one could think of EPOS [13], that does not include, massive quarks and quarkonia production.",

Our recommendation is to perform this study with the new LHC data at 7 TeV in proton-proton collisions. The ALICE, ATLAS, CMS and LHCb experiments have complementary acceptance. For instance, CMS can measure J/\u03c8 with |y| < 2.4 but missing the lower p T part of the spectrum at midrapidity, while AL-ICE will measured J/\u03c8 in rapidity ranges of |y| < 0.8 and 2.5 < y < 4, at all p T . This measurement should be performed in the four experiments and compared. More generally, a detailed study for all observables should be performed regarding the multiplicity.",
