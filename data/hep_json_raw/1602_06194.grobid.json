Events with large numbers of jets, together with missing transverse momentum from unobserved particles, are selected. The data analysed were recorded by the ATLAS experiment during 2015 using the 13 TeV centre-of-mass proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider, and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 3.2 fb \u22121 . The search selected events with various jet multiplicities from \u2265 7 to \u2265 10 jets, and with various b-jet multiplicity requirements to enhance sensitivity. No excess above Standard Model expectations is observed. The results are interpreted within two supersymmetry models, where gluino masses up to 1400 GeV are excluded at 95% confidence level, significantly extending previous limits.",

            "text": "New strongly interacting particles, if present at the TeV energy scale, may be produced in high-energy proton-proton (pp) collisions and decay to final states with large jet multiplicities. If their decay produces stable particles which only interact weakly, it will also result in a momentum imbalance in the plane transverse to the beam ( E miss T ). Such particles are present in supersymmetry (SUSY) [1][2][3][4][5][6], a theoretically favoured extension of the Standard Model (SM) that predicts partner fields for each of the SM particles. These fields combine into physical superpartners of the SM particles. The scalar partners of quarks and leptons are known as squarks (q) and sleptons (\u02dc ). The fermionic partners of gauge and Higgs bosons are the gluinos (g), the charginos (\u03c7 \u00b1 i , with i = 1, 2) and the neutralinos (\u03c7 0 i with i = 1, 2, 3, 4), with \u03c7 \u00b1 i and \u03c7 0 i being the mass eigenstates, ordered from the lightest to the heaviest, formed from the linear superpositions of the SUSY partners of the Higgs and electroweak gauge bosons.",

            "text": "Under the hypothesis of R-parity conservation [7], SUSY partners are produced in pairs and decay to the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP), which is stable and in a large variety of models is assumed to be the lightest neutralino (\u03c7 0 1 ), which escapes detection. The undetected \u03c7 0 multiple jets and possibly leptons and/or photons. The strongly interacting gluinos and squarks can have large production crosssections at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), but no evidence of their existence has been observed to date. This paper presents the results of a search for new phenomena, such as supersymmetry, in final states with large jet multiplicities (from \u22657 to \u226510 jets) in association with E miss T . This signature is exhibited, for example, by squark and gluino production followed by cascade decay chains, and/or decays to heavy SM particles, such as top quarks or W , Z or Higgs bosons, each of which can produce multiple jets in their decays. In contrast to many other searches for the production of strongly interacting SUSY particles, the requirement made here of large jet multiplicity means that the requirement on E miss T can be modest. Previous searches [8][9][10] in similar final states have been performed by the ATLAS Collaboration at the lower centre-of-mass energies of \u221a s = 7 TeV and 8 TeV, with integrated luminosities up to 20.3 fb \u22121 . The larger energy of the present dataset provides increased sensitivity, particularly to particles with higher masses. This paper closely follows the strategy of those previous studies. In particular, data are collected using an online selection relying only on high jet multiplicity and the signal regions (SR) are designed such that the dominant multijet background can be determined from the data using regions of lower E miss T and/or lower jet multiplicity.",

Fifteen different SRs are defined, providing wide-ranging sensitivity to models with different final states and mass spectra. There are three different triplets of regions defined in terms of the jet multiplicity n 50 and two different triplets of regions defined in terms of n 80 . Within each triplet, different requirements are made on n b-jet , from no requirement to the requirement of at least two b-jets. In all cases the final selection is on the ratio of E miss T to \u221a H T , with the choice of a threshold at 4 GeV 1/2 being a good balance between background rejection and signal efficiency while maintaining the effectiveness of the background estimation. Events containing electron or muon candidates with p T > 10 GeV are vetoed to reduce background from SM processes.",

This generator uses the four-flavour scheme for the next-to-leading order (NLO) matrix element calculations together with the fixed four-flavour PDF set CT10f4 [33]. For this process, the top quarks are decayed using MadSpin [34] preserving all spin correlations, while for all processes the parton shower, fragmentation, and the underlying event are simulated using PYTHIA v6.428 [35] with the CTEQ6L1 PDF sets [36] and the corresponding Perugia 2012 tune (P2012) [37]. The top quark mass is set to 172.5 GeV. The EvtGen v1.2.0 program [38] models the bottom and charm hadron decays, as it does for all non-SHERPA-simulated processes mentioned below. The tt simulation is normalised to the cross-section calculated to next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in perturbative QCD, including soft-gluon resummation to next-to-next-to-leadinglog (NNLL) accuracy [39].",

For each SR jet selection, an appropriate E miss T / \u221a H T distribution template is normalised to the data in a further CR having the same jet multiplicity as the SR but with E miss T / \u221a H T < 1.  When constructing and normalising the E miss T / \u221a H T templates, the same lepton veto is used as for the signal regions. However, some leptonic background contributions persist, and so the expected leptonic backgrounds to those templates (normalised according to their theoretical cross-sections, as described in Section 4.1) are subtracted from the data distributions. The uncertainties associated with the leptonic backgrounds are included in the systematic uncertainty in the prediction. Non-stochastic contributions to calorimeter resolution, which lead to a residual dependence of the E miss T H T invariance is tested with data, using a series of validation regions (VR) with smaller jet multiplicities or smaller E miss T / \u221a H T (between 1.5 GeV 1/2 and 3.5 GeV 1/2 ) than the SRs, or both. These VRs are found to be described by the templates, constructed as described above, mostly to within 10%-20%. However, for the tightest regions (with very few events) the discrepancy reaches 60%. The tests are performed separately for each of the three b-jet requirements, and the largest difference for each set, including VRs with jet multiplicity up to and including that of the SR in question, is included as an overall 'closure' systematic uncertainty associated with the method.",

All uncertainties on the Standard Model expectation are considered, including those which are correlated between signal and background (for instance jet energy scale uncertainties) and all, except theoretical cross-section uncertainties (PDF and scale), on the signal expectation. The resulting exclusion regions, shown in Fig. 5, are obtained using the CL s prescription [67]. For each signal model point, the signal region with the best expected limit is used. Signal regions defined by n 50 and those defined by n 80 both contribute to the best expected limit.

The increase in the LHC centre-of-mass energy provided increased sensitivity to higher-mass sparticles compared with previous searches. Further sensitivity was gained by considering separately final states with \u2265 0, \u2265 1 and \u2265 2 b-tagged jets. The Standard Model predictions are found to be consistent with the data. The results are interpreted in the context of a simplified supersymmetry model, and a slice of the pMSSM, each of which predict cascade decays of supersymmetric particles and hence large jet multiplicities. The data exclude gluino masses up to 1400 GeV at the 95% CL in these models, significantly extending previous bounds.
