The results are interpreted in the context of the benchmark Sequential Standard Model (SSM), i.e. the extended gauge model described in Ref. [1], in which the couplings of the W SSM to fermions are assumed to be identical to those of the SM W boson. The decay of the SSM W to SM bosons is not allowed and interference between the SSM W and the SM W boson is neglected.

It consists of an inner tracking detector (ID) surrounded by a thin superconducting solenoid providing a 2 T axial magnetic field, electromagnetic (EM) and hadronic calorimeters, and a muon spectrometer (MS). The inner tracking detector covers the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 2.5. It 1 ATLAS uses a right-handed coordinate system with its origin at the nominal interaction point (IP) in the centre of the detector and the z-axis along the beam pipe. The x-axis points from the IP to the centre of the LHC ring, and the y-axis consists of a silicon pixel detector including the newly installed insertable B-layer [5,6], followed by silicon microstrip, and transition radiation tracking detectors. Lead/liquid-argon (LAr) sampling calorimeters provide EM energy measurements with high granularity. A hadronic (steel/scintillator-tile) calorimeter covers the central pseudorapidity range (|\u03b7| < 1.7). The endcap and forward regions are instrumented with LAr calorimeters for both the EM and hadronic energy measurements up to |\u03b7| = 4.9. The muon spectrometer surrounds the calorimeters and is based on three large air-core toroid superconducting magnets with eight coils each. The field integral of the toroids ranges between 2.0 and 6.0 Tm for most of the detector. It includes a system of precision tracking chambers, over |\u03b7| < 2.7, and fast detectors for triggering, over |\u03b7| < 2.4. A two-level trigger system is used to select events. The first-level trigger is implemented in hardware and uses a subset of the detector information. This is followed by a software-based trigger system that reduces the accepted event rate to about 1 kHz.",

The same setup is used for the neutral-current DY (qq \u2192 Z /\u03b3 * \u2192 ) process. In both cases, samples for all three lepton flavours are generated, and the final-state photon radiation (QED FSR) is handled by Photos [10]. The DY samples are normalised as a function of mass to a next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) perturbative QCD (pQCD) calculation using VRAP [11] and the CT14NNLO PDF set [12]. In addition, NLO electroweak (EW) corrections beyond QED FSR are calculated with Mcsanc [13,14] at LO in pQCD as a function of mass. In order to combine the QCD and EW terms, the so-called additive approach is used where the EW corrections are added to the NNLO QCD cross-section prediction.",

In addition, tight identification criteria [19] need to be satisfied. The identification uses a likelihood discriminant based on measurements of calorimeter shower shapes and measurements of track properties from the ID. To ensure that the electrons originate from the primary vertex, the transverse impact parameter significance must be below five. Furthermore, calorimeter-and track-based isolation criteria, tuned for an overall efficiency of 98%, independent of p T , are applied. The sum of the calorimeter transverse energy deposits in the isolation cone of size R = 0.2 (excluding the electron itself) divided by the electron p T is used in the discrimination criterion. The track-based isolation is determined similarly to that for muons. The scalar sum of the p T of all tracks in a cone around the electron, divided by the electron p T has to be below a given value.",

Instead of calculating only one overall PDF uncertainty based on the full set of 56 eigenvectors, this analysis uses a reduced set of seven eigenvectors with a mass dependence similar to the one provided by the authors of the CT14 PDF using MP4LHC [27,28]. Their sum in quadrature is shown as \"PDF variation\" in Table 2. An additional uncertainty is assigned to account for potential differences when using the MMHT2014 [29] or NNPDF3.0 [30] PDF sets. Of these, only the central values for NNPDF3.0 fall outside the \"PDF variation\" uncertainty at large m T . Thus, an envelope of the \"PDF variation\" and the NNPDF3.0 central value is formed, where the former is subtracted in quadrature from this envelope, and the remaining part, which is only non-zero when the NNPDF3.0 central value is outside the \"PDF variation\" uncertainty, is quoted as \"PDF choice\". Uncertainties in the higher order electroweak corrections are determined as the difference between the additive approach and a factorised approach, which approximately span the range allowed for mixed EW and QCD contributions. Uncertainties due to higherorder QCD corrections on the charged-current DY are estimated using VRAP by varying the renormalisation and factorisation scales simultaneously up and down by a factor of two and are found to be negligible.

The observed upper limits are derived by comparing data to the expected background, using templates for the shape of the simulated m T distributions for different signal masses. Similarly, the expected limit is determined using pseudo-experiments obtained from the estimated background distributions, instead of the actual data. The pseudo-experiments result in a distribution of limits, the median of which is taken as the expected limit, and \u00b11\u03c3 and \u00b12\u03c3 bands are defined as the ranges containing respectively 68% and 95% of the limits obtained with the pseudo-experiments. The limit setting is based on a Bayesian approach detailed in Ref. [37], using the Bayesian Analysis Toolkit [38], with a uniform positive prior probability distribution for \u03c3 \u00d7 B. Fig. 2 presents the expected and observed limits separately for the electron and muon channels. Fig. 3 shows their combination, taking into account that the theoretical uncertainties as well as the systematic uncertainties in the E miss T , jet energy resolution and luminosity are correlated between the channels. The expected upper limit on \u03c3 \u00d7 B is stronger in the electron channel due to the larger acceptance times efficiency and the better momentum resolution (see Section 4). The difference in resolution can be seen in Fig. 1 when comparing the shapes of the three reconstructed W SSM signals. For both channels and their combination, the observed limit does not deviate above the 2\u03c3 band of expected limits for all m W .",

Interference effects between the W and the SM W boson are neglected. In this model the branching ratio to a charged lepton and a neutrino is 8.2% in the entire mass range considered in this search. The decay W \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd, where the \u03c4 lepton subsequently decays leptonically is not treated as part of the signal. If included, this decay would constitute a very small contribution. The signal samples are normalised to the same mass-dependent NNLO pQCD calculation as used for the DY process. The EW corrections beyond QED FSR are not applied to the signal samples because they depend on the couplings of the new particle to W and Z bosons, and are therefore model-dependent. The resulting cross-section times branching ratio for W SSM masses of 2, 3 and 4 TeV are 153, 15.3 and 2.25 fb, respectively.",
