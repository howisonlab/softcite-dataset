The analysis strategy for the extraction of the D 0 and D + signals out of the large combinatorial background from uncorrelated tracks is based on the reconstruction and selection of secondary vertex topologies with significant separation (typically a few hundred micrometer) from the primary vertex. The Time Projection Chamber (TPC) and the Inner Tracking System (ITS) detectors provide a spatial resolution on the track position in the vicinity of the primary vertex of the order of few tens of microns at sufficiently high p t [7]. Tracks displaced from the primary vertex are selected to reconstruct D meson candidates. Good alignment between the reconstructed meson momentum and the flight direction between the primary and secondary vertex is also required. The identification of the charged kaon in the TPC and Time Of Flight detectors provides additional background rejection. A particle identification strategy that preserves most of the D meson signal was adopted. Similar analyses were performed on pp and Pb-Pb data, with a tighter selection in the latter case, dictated by the higher combinatorial background. To extract the signal, a fit to the invariant mass distribution is performed, using a Gaussian function for the signal peak and an exponential function for the background. Figure 1 (left) shows the invariant mass distribution of D 0 candidates for p t > 2 GeV/c, obtained from the analysis of \u2248 3 \u00d7 10 6 Pb-Pb events in the 0 \u2212 20% centrality range. The 'raw' signal is corrected for acceptance and efficiency using Monte Carlo simulations based on Pythia (Perugia-0 tuning) and HIJING event generators. The contribution of D mesons from B decays was evaluated relying on the FONLL prediction, which describes well bottom production at the Tevatron [8] and at the LHC [9,10]. In the Pb-Pb case, the FONLL prediction of secondary D mesons production in pp collisions is multiplied by N coll \u00d7 R B",

The systematic error due to the FONLL theoretical uncertainty on beauty prediction was estimated from the spread of the results recovered using the minimum and maximum predictions for secondary D production. As reported in [11], the D meson production cross-sections in pp collisions at \u221a s = 7 TeV are well described by predictions based on pQCD calculations as FONLL [8] and GM-VFNS [12]. and D + signals were measured in the 2 < p t < 8 GeV/c range. While the accumulated statistics did not allow for determining a pp reference over the whole momentum range, it served as an important cross check of the theoretical scaling procedure in the momentum range where the data sets overlap. Considering only the statistical errors, the ratio between the cross-section measured at 2.76 TeV and that obtained from the scaling of the measurement at 7 TeV is compatible with 1 within 1\u03c3 for the D + while, for the D 0 , within 1\u03c3 above 4 GeV/c and within 2\u03c3 for 2 < p t < 4 GeV/c. A further 20% asymmetric contribution to the systematic error in the 2 < p t < 4 GeV/c range has been added on the D 0 cross-section at 2.76 TeV used as the pp reference in the R AA calculations. Figure 1 (right) shows the D 0 p t spectra measured in central (0 \u221220%) and peripheral (40 \u2212 80%) Pb-Pb collisions, compared to their respective reference spectra.",
