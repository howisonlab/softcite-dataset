            "text": "Heavy quarks are produced in the early stages of ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions, and their number is preserved throughout the subsequent evolution of the system. Therefore, they constitute ideal probes for characterising the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) medium and for the study of its transport properties. In particular, heavy quarks interact with the partonic constituents of the plasma, losing energy, and are expected to be sensitive to the medium collective motion induced by its hydrodynamical evolution. In pp collisions, the measurement of heavy-flavour hadron production provides a reference for heavyion studies, and allows also testing perturbative QCD calculations in a wide range of collision energies. Similar studies in p-Pb collisions help in disentangling cold nuclear matter effects from modifications induced by the presence of a QGP medium, and are also useful to investigate the possible existence of collective phenomena also in this system. The ALICE detector provides excellent performances in terms of particle identification and vertexing capabilities. Hence, it is fully suited for the reconstruction of charmed mesons and baryons and of electrons from heavy-flavour hadron decays at central rapidity. Furthermore, the ALICE muon spectrometer allows reconstructing heavy-flavour decay muons at forward rapidity. A review of the main ALICE results on open heavy flavour production in pp, p-Pb and Pb-Pb collisions is presented. Recent, more differential measurements are also shown, including azimuthal correlations of heavy-flavour particles with charged hadrons in p-Pb collisions, and D-meson tagged-jet production in p-Pb and Pb-Pb collisions.",

A positive v 2 was already measured by AL-ICE for light-flavour hadrons at midrapidity [9], and its interpretation, either as a final-state or initial-state effect, is currently debated, evidencing the need of additional measurements also in the heavy-flavour sector. Another recent differential study is the measurement of the production cross section of jets with a D-meson constituent (D-jets), in all collision systems. This measurement provides a closer access to the parton kinematics with respect to the study of the D-meson cross section. In addition, comparing the momentum fraction of the jet carried by the D meson in pp and Pb-Pb collisions provides information on the modification of the heavy-quark fragmentation in a QGP medium.",

This suppression can be ascribed to final-state effects, since in p-Pb collisions the equivalent observable R pPb was found to be compatible with unity within uncertainties over the full p T range [13]. In both panels, ALICE measurements are compared with model predictions based on heavy-quark transport in a viscous hydrodynamic medium, which provide a description for both observables. Models in which charm quarks pick up collective flow via recombination or subsequent elastic collisions and include radiative energy loss in an expanding medium better reproduce the two observables. Anyway, a simultaneous description of both observables over the full p T range remains a challenging task, and these measurements are able to set strong constraints to models. The best v 2 description is provided by models predicting a charm thermalisation time of \u03c4 c = 3 \u2212 14 fm/c. This is of the same order of the QGP decoupling time, implying a certain degree of thermalisation of charm quarks in the medium. ",

The light hadron production does not scale with the average number of binary collision N coll for p T \u2264 3GeV/c; a different energy scale from heavy-and light-flavour hadrons to corresponding partons could enter in play due to the different fragmentation of the latter, and the initial p T spectrum is not the same for light and heavy partons; finally, the radial flow contribution could affect differently lightand heavy-flavour mesons.",

            "text": "The left panel of Figure 4 shows the azimuthal correlation distribution between heavy-flavour decay electrons with 2 < p T < 4 GeV/c and charged particles with 0.3 < p T < 2 GeV/c, in p-Pb collisions at \u221a s NN = 5.02 TeV, normalised by the number of heavy-flavour decay electrons [21]. Two different multiplicity ranges, 0-20% (red points) and 60-100% (black points), classified using the signal amplitude in the V0-A detector, were considered. The correlation distributions are shown after the subtraction of a 'baseline' term, evaluated via a fit with a constant to the three lowest points of the distribution. An enhancement of the peaks at \u2206\u03d5 \u2248 0 and \u2206\u03d5 \u2248 \u03c0 can be observed for high-multiplicity collisions. The jet contribution is assumed comparable for the two multiplicity classes and removed by subtracting the lowmultiplicity from the high-multiplicity distribution. This allows extracting the v 2 coefficient of heavy-flavour decay electrons via a fit to the subtracted correlation distribution with a Fourier decomposition in \u2206\u03d5.",

            "text": "The values of the elliptic-flow coefficient are shown in the right panel of Fig. 4 as a function of the electron transverse momentum. A positive v 2 is measured for the range 1.5 < p T < 4 GeV/c with a significance of 5.1\u03c3. The values of heavy-flavour decay electron v 2 are generally lower, though still comparable, than those measured for charged particles, dominated by light-flavour hadrons. An interpretation of this comparison is anyway not immediate, since the transverse-momentum distribution of heavy-flavour hadrons from which the electrons originate is considerably broader than that of light-flavour hadrons, as well as EPJ Web of Conferences 192, 00016 (2018) https://doi.org/10.1051/epjconf/201819200016 QCD@Work 2018 having a larger average value. The v 2 of heavy-flavour decay electrons has a similar trend of that of inclusive muons, measured by ALICE at forward and backward rapidity [22] and dominated by heavy-flavour decay muons for p T > 2 GeV/c. Drawing conclusions from this comparison is not straightforward because of the different cold-nuclear-matter effects affecting heavy flavours in different rapidity ranges. ALICE has measured the p T -differential production cross section of prompt D 0 -jets in p-Pb and Pb-Pb collisions at \u221a s NN = 5.02 TeV. Jets were reconstructed in the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 0.6, using the FASTJET [23] package with the anti-k T algorithm, after substituting the daughters tracks of the D 0 with the D 0 particle. The feed-down contribution to the D 0 -jet spectrum was subtracted exploiting POWHEG+PYTHIA [24,25] simulations. Detector effects and background fluctuations were corrected for with a Bayes unfolding procedure [26].",

Data are compared to POWHEG+PYTHIA predictions, which are found to be compatible with ALICE measurements within uncertainties, dominated by the theory uncertainty band. In the right panel of the same figure, the nuclear modification factor of D 0 -jets in 0-20% central Pb-Pb collisions is presented for 5 < p T (jet) < 20 GeV/c, showing a strong suppression by a factor \u2248 5-6. D 0 -jet R AA is compared with the inclusivejet R AA , dominated by gluon and light-flavour jets. A stronger suppression seems to occur for D 0 -jets, though the non-overlapping p T ranges of the two measurements prevent drawing firm conclusions. D 0 -jet R AA is also compared with the average of non-strange D-meson R AA [12], showing a similar suppression in the common p T range. This could signal that the D 0 -jets energy loss could be dominated by the energy loss of their leading particle, although the different energy scale for the charm quark transverse momentum in the two cases has to be accounted for.",
