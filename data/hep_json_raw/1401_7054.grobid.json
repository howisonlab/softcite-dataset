Four-momentum transfers defined as Q 2 (4 mom) = q 2 (3 mom) space \u2212 (energy) time (1) can be positive and spacelike, or negative and timelike. I am going to talk about form factors for timelike momentum transfers as measured via the reactions e + e \u2212 \u2192 hadron-antihadron. In 1960, the first proposals for electron-positron colliders were being considered at SLAC and Frascati. In anticipation of these, Cabibbo and Gatto wrote two classic papers [1] pointing out that these colliders would provide the unique opportunity to measure timelike form factors of any hadrons, mesons and baryons. Only 50 years later, we are now realizing the full promise of the vision of Cabibbo and Gatto in the measurements I am reporting here.",

Quarks were not even invented when Cabibbo and Gatto suggested that measurement of hyperon form factors would be interesting. In the present context of QCD and the quark-gluon structure of hadrons, it is particularly interesting to measure form factors of hyperons which may be expected to reveal the effects of SU (3) breaking, as successively one, two, and three of the up/down quarks in the nucleon are replaced by strange quarks in ( , ), , and , respectively. The interest is further enhanced at large momentum transfers at which deeper insight is obtained into possible short-range correlations between the quarks. As Wilczek [4] has pointed out, \"several of the most profound aspects of low-energy QCD dynamics are connected to diquark correlations,\" and the differences in quark-quark configurations between different hyperons make them an ideal laboratory to study diquark correlations.",

Clear peaks are seen for each decay mode with yields ranging from 105 for 0\u00af 0 to 3 for \u2212\u00af \u2212 . The few events seen in the neighborhood of X \u2248 0.98 are consistent with being from the decay of (2S) populated by initial state radiation (ISR). The number of events, N ff , in the region X(B) = 0.99 \u2212 1.01, are used to calculate the cross sections as, 0 (e + e \u2212 \u2192 BB) = N ff /(1 + ) B L(3770), where B are the MC-determined efficiencies at \u221a s = 3770 MeV, (1 + ) = 0.77 is the radiative correction, and L(3770) = 805 pb \u22121 is the luminosity at \u221a s = 3770 MeV.",

This results in a significantly larger cross section for the formation of 0 than 0 , as anticipated by Selem and Wilczek [11]. We measure ( 0 )/ ( 0 ) \u2248 3, and this results in the factor 1.66 larger form factor for 0 than 0 . We believe that our observation of the large difference in the form factors of 0 and 0 is indeed due to significant \"good\" diquark correlation in 0 , and it constitutes an important example of significant diquark correlations in baryons.",

Clearly, larger statistics measurements of the form factors would be highly desirable. (b) As illustrated in Fig. 3 (right), the measured values of |G B M | vary rather smoothly by approximately a factor two, except for G M ( 0 ). (c) It is common practice to quote spacelike form factors for protons as G p M (s)/ p , based on normalization at |Q 2 | = 0. We note that there is no evidence for the proportionality of G B M (s) to B for hyperons. As listed in Table 3, G B M (s)/ B vary by more than a factor 4 for the different baryons.",

We note that 0 and 0 differ in their isospin, with I ( 0 ) = 1, and I ( 0 ) = 0. Since only up and down quarks carry isospin, this implies that the pair of up/down quarks in 0 and 0 have different isospin configurations. This forces different spin configurations in 0 and 0 . In 0 the ud quarks have antiparallel spins coupled to S = 0, whereas in 0 they couple to S = 1. The spatial overlap in the S = 0 configuration in 0 is stronger than in the S = 1 configuration in 0 , and our measurement at large |Q 2 | is particularly sensitive to it.",
