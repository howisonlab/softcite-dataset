The analysis includes the full 2010 data set, collected with a low rate of multiple proton-proton collisions in the accelerator, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36 pb \u22121 . Inclusive jet cross sections in Z/\u03b3 * events, with Z/\u03b3 * decaying into electron or muon pairs, are measured for jets with transverse momentum p T > 30 GeV and jet rapidity |y| < 4.4. The measurements are compared to next-to-leading-order perturbative QCD calculations, and to predictions from different Monte Carlo generators implementing leading-order matrix elements supplemented by parton showers.",

Moreover, since these processes form important backgrounds for searches of new physics, their detailed measurement is a first step in the discovery program at LHC. This contribution presents a review of the measurements of jet production in events with a Z/\u03b3 * boson using 36 pb \u22121 of data collected by the ATLAS experiment [1] in 2010 at \u221a s = 7 TeV. During this period, the luminosity of the machine has grown roughly exponentially with running time up to 2.1 \u00d7 10 32 cm \u22122 s \u22121 . The ATLAS detector performed well throughout the 2010 run and its response was quickly understood. The measurements, described in detail in [2], are compared with the available next-to-leading-order (NLO) pQCD calculations, providing a validation of the theory in the new kinematic regime, and with the Monte Carlo (MC) predictions that include leading-order (LO) matrix elements supplemented by parton showers. The latter are affected by large scale uncertainties and need to be tuned and validated using data.",

Events are selected with a Z/\u03b3 * boson decaying into a pair of electrons (e + e \u2212 ) or muons (\u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ). In both cases a single lepton trigger, electron or muon, is employed. In the electron channel, a e-mail: evelin.meoni@cern.ch the events are selected to have two oppositely charged reconstructed electrons with transverse energy E T > 20 GeV, pseudorapidity in the range |\u03b7 e | < 2.47 (where the transition region between calorimeter sections 1.37 < |\u03b7 e | < 1.52 is excluded). In the muon channel, the events are selected to have two oppositely charged reconstructed muons with transverse momentum p T > 20 GeV, pseudorapidity in the range |\u03b7 \u00b5 | < 2.4. In both cases, a dilepton invariant mass in the range 66 GeV< m ll < 116 GeV is required. Jets are reconstructed using the anti-kt algorithm [3] with a distance parameter R=0.4. The inputs to the anti-kt jet algorithm are clusters of calorimeter cells seeded by cells with energy that is significantly above the measured noise. The measured jet transverse momentum p T is corrected to the particle level scale using an average correction, computed as a function of jet transverse momentum and pseudorapidity, and extracted from MC simulation. In this analysis, jets are selected with corrected p T > 30 GeV and |y| < 4.4 separated from each of the two leptons by a \u2206R >0.5. The background contamination is estimated using MC simulated samples, except for the QCD multijet contribution, where a data-driven method is employed for each channel. A template fit is used in the electron channel, whereas the di-muon mass versus the muon isolation plane is employed in the muon case. In the electron channel, the total background increases from 5% to 17% as the inclusive jet multiplicity (N jet ) increases and is dominated by multijet processes, followed by tt and diboson processes. In the muon channel, the background increases from 2% to 10% as N jet increases, dominated by tt and diboson processes.",

This observable cancels part of the systematic uncertainty and constitutes an improved test of the Standard Model. The data indicate that the cross sections decrease by a factor of approximately five with the requirement of each additional jet in the final state. The inclusive jet differential cross section as a function of p T is presented in Fig. 3 in events with at least one jet in the final state for the electron channel. The cross sections are divided by the corresponding inclusive Z cross section times branching ratio with the aim of canceling systematic uncertainties related to lepton identification and the luminosity. The cross sections decrease by more than two orders of magnitude as p T increases in the explored range. Fig. 4 shows the measured differential cross section as a function of the rapidity separation of the jets for the muon channel. The combination of electron and muon results has also been performed by extrapolating the measurements of the two channels to a common lepton kinematical region : p T > 20 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.5 as defined at the vertex of the Z boson. The electron and muon results are combined using the BLUE (Best Linear Unbiased Estimate) [9] method.  rections, as well as by predictions of LO matrix elements of up to 2 \u2192 5 parton scatters, supplemented by parton showers, as implemented in the ALPGEN and Sherpa MC generators.
