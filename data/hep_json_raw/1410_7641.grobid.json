The properties of the Y\u00f04360\u00de and Y\u00f04660\u00de states are determined. Fitting the mass spectrum of \u03c0 \u00fe \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c8\u00f02S\u00de with two coherent Breit-Wigner functions, we find two solutions with identical mass and width but different couplings to electron-positron pairs: M Y\u00f04360\u00de \u00bc \u00f04347 AE 6 AE 3\u00de MeV=c 2 , \u0393 Y\u00f04360\u00de \u00bc \u00f0103 AE 9 AE 5\u00de MeV, M Y\u00f04660\u00de \u00bc \u00f04652 AE 10 AE 8\u00de MeV=c 2 , \u0393 Y\u00f04660\u00de \u00bc \u00f068 AE 11 AE 1\u00de MeV;",

Some are good candidates for conventional charmonium states, while others exhibit unusual properties consistent with expectations for exotic states such as tetraquarks, molecules, hybrids, hadrocharmonia, or glueballs [1,2]. The initial state radiation (ISR) technique has played a very important role in the discovery and studies of a number of the charmonium and charmoniumlike states. The J PC quantum numbers of the final states accompanying the ISR photon(s) are restricted to J PC \u00bc 1 \u2212\u2212 and so favor this technique for the study of vector particles.",

Moreover, Belle reported a broad structure near 4.0 GeV that they dubbed the Y\u00f04008\u00de. In an analysis of the e \u00fe e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b3 ISR \u03c0 \u00fe \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c8\u00f02S\u00de process, BABAR found a structure near 4.32 GeV [6], while Belle observed two resonant structures at 4.36 and 4.66 GeV [7]. Recently, both BABAR and Belle updated their results on e \u00fe e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b3 ISR \u03c0 \u00fe \u03c0 \u2212 J=\u03c8, which still show differences in the 4.008 GeV=c 2 mass region [8,9]; the latest e \u00fe e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b3 ISR \u03c0 \u00fe \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c8\u00f02S\u00de analysis from the BABAR experiment with its full data sample confirmed the existence of the Y\u00f04660\u00de state [10]. However, in an ISR study of e \u00fe e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b7J=\u03c8 by Belle, only the well-established \u03c8\u00f04040\u00de and \u03c8\u00f04160\u00de charmonium states, but no Y states, are observed [11]. A better understanding of the structures observed in these final states would benefit from improved measurements.",

If a charged structure in \u03c0 AE \u03c8\u00f02S\u00de exists (cf. Sec. VI), it may affect the determination of the resonant parameters. A test fit to \u03c0 \u00fe \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c8\u00f02S\u00de invariant-mass spectra is tried. Two components of Y\u00f04360\u00de decays are included in the fit, one decaying to \u03c0 \u00fe \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c8\u00f02S\u00de according to three-body phase space (50%) and the other decaying to \u03c0 AE Z \u2213 c (50%). Since the statistical errors of Z c mass and width are large, the mass is fixed to be 4.05 GeV=c 2 when the two-body phase space is calculated. No Z c substructure is included in Y\u00f04660\u00de decays. Fit with either Y\u00f04360\u00de \u00fe Y\u00f04660\u00de or Y\u00f04260\u00de \u00fe Y\u00f04360\u00de \u00fe Y\u00f04660\u00de does not result in significant change in the resonant parameters of the Y\u00f04360\u00de and Y\u00f04660\u00de. Since the charged structure is not significant (cf. Sec. VI), the effect due to possible existence of the Z c states is not considered. The factor M i =M\u00f0\u03c0 \u00fe \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c8\u00f02S\u00de\u00de in Eq. 1is removed in the fit when estimating the uncertainties from resonance parametrization. Half of the difference on each fit result with and without this factor is taken as the systematic error of resonance parametrization. In addition, systematic-error contributions are determined when the fit range is changed from \u00bd4.0; 5.5 GeV=c 2 to \u00bd4.0; 5.3 GeV=c 2 and, separately, the background shape is changed from a first-order polynomial to a constant.",

In the simulation, the mass of Z AE is 4050 MeV=c 2 and the width is 40 MeV. A fit to the simulated M max \u00f0\u03c0 AE \u03c8\u00f02S\u00de\u00de distribution yields M \u00bc \u00f04056 AE 1\u00de MeV=c 2 and \u0393 \u00bc \u00f040.8 AE 2.2\u00de MeV. The shift in the mass is due to the fact that the reflection of the signal may have a larger \u03c0 AE \u03c8\u00f02S\u00de mass than the proper combination, thus biasing M max \u00f0\u03c0 AE \u03c8\u00f02S\u00de\u00de. We shift the measured mass by \u0394M \u00bc \u22126 MeV=c 2 to account for this effect and assign 1 MeV=c 2 as its systematic error. \u0394\u0393 \u00bc 3.0 MeV is taken as the systematic error of the measured width.  After the bias correction based on MC simulation, we obtain a mass of \u00f04054 AE 3\u00f0stat\u00de AE 1\u00f0syst\u00de\u00de MeV=c 2 and a width of \u00f045 AE 11\u00f0stat\u00de AE 6\u00f0syst\u00de\u00de MeV for the Z AE structure in the \u03c0 AE \u03c8\u00f02S\u00de system. The systematic uncertainties from the parametrization of the resonances, the phase-space factor due to the J P assignment of the structure, the fit range, and the background shape are considered. The lowest statistical significance of the signal is 3.5\u03c3 when comparing without the Breit-Wigner component. Figure 14 shows the scatter plots of M \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c8\u00f02S\u00de versus M \u03c0 \u00fe \u03c8\u00f02S\u00de and the one-dimensional projections in the Y\u00f04660\u00de subsample.
