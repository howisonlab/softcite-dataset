The analysis uses a data sample collected at a centre-of-mass energy of 2.76 TeV with the CMS experiment at the LHC. The UE activity is measured as a function of p jet T in terms of the average multiplicity and scalar sum of transverse momenta (p T ) of charged particles, with |\u03b7| < 2 and p T > 0.5 GeV, in the azimuthal region transverse to the highest p T jet direction. By further dividing the transverse region into two regions of smaller and larger activity, various components of the UE activity are separated. The measurements are compared to previous results at 0.9 and 7 TeV, and to predictions of several Monte Carlo event generators, providing constraints on the modelling of the UE dynamics.",

            "text": "Hadron production in high-energy proton-proton (pp) collisions originates from multiple scatterings of the partonic constituents of the protons at central rapidities, and from \"spectator\" (noncolliding) partons emitted in the very forward direction. The produced partons reduce their virtuality through gluon radiation and quark-antiquark splittings, and finally fragment into hadrons at scales approaching 0.2 GeV (\u039b QCD ). Usually, one separates the produced hadrons into two classes: those coming directly from the fragmentation of partons resulting from the scattering with the largest momentum transfer (hard scattering) in the event, and the rest (underlying event, or UE). The UE thus consists of hadrons coming from (i) initial-and final-state radiation (ISR, FSR) from the hard scattering, (ii) softer partonic scatters in the same pp collision (multiple parton interactions, or MPI) possibly with their own initial-and final-state radiation, and (iii) proton remnants concentrated along the beam direction. An accurate understanding of the UE is required for precise measurements of standard model processes at high energies and searches for new physics. Indeed, the UE affects measurements of isolated high transverse momentum p T leptons or photons, and it dominates most of the hadronic activity from the overlapping pp collisions taking place in a given bunch crossing (pileup) at the high luminosities achieved by the CERN LHC. The semi-hard and low-momentum partonic processes, which dominate the UE, cannot be adequately calculated with perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (pQCD) methods alone, and require a phenomenological description containing parameters that must be tuned to data.",

            "text": "The topological structure of pp interactions with a hard scattering can be used to define experimental observables sensitive to the UE. One example is the study of particle properties in regions away from the direction of the products of the hard scattering. At the Tevatron, the CDF experiment measured UE observables using inclusive jet and Drell-Yan (DY) events in pp collisions at centre-of-mass energies \u221a s = 0.63, 1.8, and 1.96 TeV [1][2][3]. In pp collisions at the LHC, the ALICE, ATLAS, and CMS experiments have carried out UE measurements at \u221a s = 0.9 and 7 TeV using events containing a leading (highest p T ) charged-particle jet [4][5][6] or a leading charged particle [7,8], or a DY lepton pair [9]. In this paper, we study the UE activity in pp collisions at \u221a s = 2.76 TeV by measuring the average multiplicity and scalar transverse momentum sum (\u03a3p T ) densities of charged particles in the azimuthal region orthogonal to the direction of the leading charged-particle jet, referred to as the transverse region.",

On average, increasingly hard parton interactions result from pp collisions with decreasing impact parameters between the two protons, which in turn enhance the overall hadronic activity originating from MPI until a saturation is reached for central collisions with maximum overlap [10,11]. At the same time, the activity related to the ISR and FSR components also increases with the hard scale. For events with the same hard scale, probed by the p T of jets or DY pairs, the MPI activity rises with \u221a s, as more partons are expected in the protons at increasingly smaller parton fractional momenta 10,11]. Hence, studying the UE as a function of the hard scale at several centre-of-mass energies provides an insight into the UE dynamics and its evolution with the collision energy, further constraining the model parameters.",

There are various tunable parameters that control the behaviour of this regularisation, the matter distribution of partons in the transverse plane within the hadrons, and the final-state colour reconnection effects among the produced partons. When QCD radiation is modelled via a p T -ordered evolution, the MPI and parton showers are interleaved in one common sequence of decreasing p T values [15]. For the latest version of pythia6 only ISR showers and MPI are interleaved, while in pythia8 FSR showers are also included.

The frequency of MPI is then generated by assuming a Poissonian distribution of the number of elementary partonic interactions over the overlapping pp volume, with the average number depending on the impact parameter of the hadronic collision [10,11]. The MPI cross section is dominated by scatterings with semi-hard momentum transfers, O(1-2 GeV), involving low-x partons, and thus shows a stronger dependence on the evolution of the low-p T infrared cutoff, and on the incoming parton densities than the single hard-scattering interactions [10,11]. In pythia6, pythia8 and herwig++, the energy dependence of MPI is mostly controlled by the energy evolution of the low-p T infrared cutoff parameter ,which follows a (tunable) power law dependence on the centre-of-mass energy [12][13][14]. The UE activity accompanying various types of hard scattering processes is well described by MC event generators, [4,5,[7][8][9], illustrating the universality of MPI in different event topologies and hard-scattering production processes. Such a universality is confirmed by the similarity between the UE activity measured in DY [9] and jet-dominated events [4,5,7,8], despite their different underlying parton radiation patterns.",

In addition, CUETP6S1 tune also included CDF data [21] at 0.3, 0.9, and 1.96 TeV, while CUETP8S1 tune used 0.9 and 1.96 TeV data for tuning. The UE-EE-5C was tuned with the ATLAS UE data at 0.9 and 7 TeV [7] and CDF UE data at 0.3, 0.9, and 1.96 TeV [21]. None of the tunes make use of data at 2.76 TeV, making this a good test of interpolation between other centre-of-mass energies. The detector response was simulated in detail by using the geant4 package [22], and simulated events were processed and reconstructed in the same manner as collision data.",

Within the solenoid volume there are several complementary detectors: a silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter, and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter, each composed of a barrel and two endcap sections. The silicon tracker measures charged particles within the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 2.5. For non-isolated particles of 1 < p T < 10 GeV and |\u03b7| < 1.4, the track resolutions are typically 1.5% in p T , and 25-90 (45-150) \u00b5m in the transverse (longitudinal) impact parameter [23]. Two of the CMS subdetectors acting as LHC beam monitors, the Beam Scintillation Counters (BSC) and the Beam Pick-up Timing for the eXperiments (BPTX) devices, are used to trigger the detector readout. The BSC are located along the beam line on each side of the Interaction Point (IP) at a distance of 10.86 m and cover the range 3.23 < |\u03b7| < 4.65. The two BPTX devices, located inside the beam pipe at distances of 175 m from the IP, are designed to provide precise information on the bunch structure and timing of the incoming beams, with a time resolution better than 0.2 ns. A more detailed description of the CMS detector, together with a definition of the coordinate system used and the relevant kinematic variables, can be found in ref. [24].",

In 6.2% of the events there is an extra (pileup) pp collision, corresponding to an average of 0.12 overlapping pp collisions. Minimum bias events were recorded by requiring activity in both BSC counters in coincidence with signals from both BPTX devices (in contrast to ref. [5], where only one of the BPTX devices is required). To reduce the statistical uncertainty for the highly prescaled minimum bias trigger at large p jet T , single-jet triggers based on information from the calorimeters, with p T thresholds at 20 and 40 GeV, were also used to collect data (differently from ref. [5], where thresholds of 30 and 50 GeV are used). Events identified as originating from beamhalo background were removed from the sample [25]. The event selection requires exactly one primary vertex with more than four degrees of freedom (approximately 4 particles) and located no more than \u00b110 cm from the centre of the luminous region (beamspot) in the z-direction.",

Tracks not corresponding to actual charged particles (misreconstructed tracks) are suppressed by imposing the high-purity selection criteria [23]. Secondary decays are suppressed by requiring that the impact parameter significance d 0 /\u03c3(d 0 ) (measure of the distance between the track and the primary vertex in the xy-plane) and the significance in the z-direction d z /\u03c3(d z ) to be each less than 3. In order to remove tracks with poor momentum measurement, we require the relative uncertainty in the momentum measurement \u03c3(p T )/p T to be less than 5%. The average reconstruction efficiency for the selected tracks is about 85% and drops to 75% for tracks with p T \u2248 0.5 GeV and |\u03b7| \u2248 2, while the track misreconstruction rate is about 2%, increasing to about 8% for tracks with p T \u2248 0.5 GeV and |\u03b7| \u2248 2.

The use of track jets makes the transition of leading tracks to leading jets more continuous and extends the p T coverage to larger values. These jets are reconstructed from tracks with p T > 0.5 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.5 using the Seedless Infrared-Safe Cone (SISCone) [27] algorithm with distance parameter of 0.5. Although anti-k T [28] is now the preferred algorithm at the LHC, the SISCone algorithm is chosen in this analysis for compatibility with previous results [5]. Furthermore, a comparison of the UE activity obtained at generator level using SISCone and anti-k T algorithms has been performed, finding differences of only a few percent for p jet T \u2264 20 GeV. From all reconstructed track jets with |\u03b7| < 2 and p T > 1.0 GeV, the one with the largest p jet T is selected. Only events containing at least one track jet fulfilling these criteria are considered for this analysis. Jets are reconstructed with a matching efficiency of 80% at p jet T \u2248 1 GeV and up to 95% for p jet T > 20 GeV. Trigger conditions are chosen to keep the trigger efficiency as uniform as possible and close to 100%. For the p jet T ranges in [1,25), [25,50), and [50, 100) GeV, we use the minimum-bias and the two single-jet samples, respectively, corresponding to about 11M, 50k, and 23k selected events.",

Charged-particle jets and charged particles produced at central pseudorapidity (|\u03b7| < 2) with p T > 1 and 0.5 GeV, respectively, are used to study the UE properties. The direction of the leading charged-particle jet in the event is used to select charged particles in the transverse region defined by 60 \u2022 < |\u2206\u03c6| < 120 \u2022 , where \u2206\u03c6 is the relative azimuthal distance between a charged particle and the leading jet. The UE is measured in terms of particle and \u03a3p T densities, as a function of the leading p jet T , which is used as an estimate for the hard scale of the interaction. The particle density ( N ch / [\u2206\u03b7\u2206(\u2206\u03c6)]) and \u03a3p T density ( p T / [\u2206\u03b7\u2206(\u2206\u03c6)]) are computed, respectively, as the average number of primary charged particles, and the average of their scalar p T sum, each per unit of \u03b7 and of \u2206\u03c6.",

These measured observables are corrected for detector effects and selection efficiencies to reflect the primary charged-particle activity using a 2dimensional, iterative unfolding technique [30] based on response matrices that correlate the generated and reconstructed level observables. These matrices are constructed from the generator level and reconstructed level UE and p jet T observables for pythia6 Z2 events; this procedure accounts for detector effects and inefficiencies. The unfolding matrices are applied to a pythia8 4C sample to estimate the systematic uncertainties related to the correction procedure. These vary between 0.2% and 4%, depending on the observable, region and p jet T . Several other sources of systematic uncertainties may affect the results. These include the implementation of the simulation of the track and vertex selection criteria, tracker alignment and material content, background contamination, trigger conditions, and pileup contributions. The uncertainty in the simulation of the track selection is evaluated by applying various sets of selection criteria and comparing their effects on the data and on the simulated events. The impact parameter significance ranges are varied by one unit around the nominal window resulting in an effect on the densities of 0.6-4%. Replacing the highpurity selection by the simpler requirement N layers \u2265 4 and N pixel layers \u2265 2 for the silicon strip and pixel detector layers, respectively, has an effect of up to 0.8%. Varying the fraction of misreconstructed tracks by 50% affects the densities by 0.4-0.6%. The description of inactive tracker material in the simulation is adequate within 5% [4], and increasing the material densities by 5% in the simulation induces a change in the observables of 1%. The effects of tracker misalignment, precision in the IP position, and dead channels, evaluated by varying the detector conditions in the MC simulation, are each found to change the results by 0.1-0.3%. The effect of varying the trigger and vertex efficiencies within their uncertainties, as well as the effect of pileup contributions, all lead to a negligible effect.",

A steep rise of the underlying event activity in the transverse region is seen up to p jet T \u2248 8 GeV, followed by a \"saturation\" (plateau-like) region, with nearly constant multiplicity and small \u03a3p T density increase. In figure 2, the (left panes) particle and (right panes) \u03a3p T densities after unfolding are shown as a function of p jet T in the transverse region with maximum and minimum activities (transMAX and transMIN), respectively. In the transMIN region, the amount of UE activity is roughly half that in the transMAX region. The p jet T dependences observed in the two regions are also quite different. At high p T , the distributions show a slow rise in the transMAX region, while for transMIN the flattening of the UE activity as a function of p jet T is more pronounced. The corresponding distributions in the difference JHEP09(2015)137 between the transMAX and transMIN regions (transDIF) are presented in figure 3. The particle and \u03a3p T densities both show a rise with p jet T , and the plateau-like region above p jet T \u2248 8 GeV-seen for distributions in the individual transMAX and transMIN regionsis replaced by an increase as a function of p jet T . The rapid increase of the UE activity with p jet T in the region below \u223c8 GeV is mainly attributed to the increase of MPI activity as the hard scale of the interaction increases [11]. This fast rise is followed by a saturation region (for the transverse and especially transMIN distributions), with nearly constant multiplicity and small \u03a3p T density increase. This behaviour is expected as a consequence of a nearly full overlap of the colliding protons in interactions yielding the hardest parton-parton scatterings. When pp collisions occur for very small impact parameter, the amount of MPI activity saturates [10,11]. Such a distinct p jet T -dependent pattern in the amount of UE activity (sharp rise followed by a plateau above the p jet T \u2248 8 GeV transition) is clearly seen for all the observables presented, especially in the transMIN region. In contrast, the transMAX and transDIF distributions show a continuous rise with p jet T also in the high-p T regime. This is expected to be caused by contributions from initial-and final-state radiation in the transverse region [29]. Following such an interpretation, the present results provide constraints on the modelling of the different UE components.",
