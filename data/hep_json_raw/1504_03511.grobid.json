The Z boson is identified via its decay to a pair of muons. The measurement provides a precision test of quantum chromodynamics over a large region of phase space. In addition, due to the small experimental uncertainties in the measurement the data has the potential to constrain the gluon parton distribution function in the kinematic regime important for Higgs boson production via gluon fusion. The results agree with the next-to-next-to-leading-order predictions computed with the fewz program. The results are also compared to the commonly used leading-order",

            "text": "The production of lepton pairs in proton-proton collisions is dominated by the Drell-Yan (DY) process, i.e. the production of an intermediate \u03b3 * /Z boson by the incoming partons. Measurements of the cross sections as a function of the mass of the intermediate boson (hereafter referred to as the 'Z boson'), rapidity, and transverse momentum provide a very sensitive test of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Precise measurement of the differential cross section also allows comparisons to calculations employing different parton distribution functions (PDF) and underlying theoretical models. Finally, the understanding of DY lepton pair production is important in the study of several physics processes, such as diboson and tt production, as well as in searches for new resonances decaying to dileptons in models of physics beyond the standard model. Differential measurements of Z boson production at the LHC have already been performed [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8].",

The analysis uses the data sample of pp collisions collected with the CMS detector at the LHC in 2012, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb \u22121 . We present the absolute fiducial cross section and the fiducial cross section normalised to the inclusive E-mail address: cms-publication-committee-chair@cern.ch. fiducial cross section. The measurement probes the production of Z bosons up to high transverse momenta, q T \u223c 100 GeV, a kinematic regime where the production is dominated by gluon-quark fusion. The precision of this measurement leads to experimental uncertainties smaller than or similar to the uncertainties of the gluon PDF in the kinematic region that is relevant to the production of the Higgs boson via the gluon fusion mechanism. Using the Z boson production process to constrain the gluon PDF [9] in the future would be complementary to other processes such as direct photon production [10] and top-quark pair production [11] that constrain the gluon PDF in this regime. Moreover, several of the experimental systematic uncertainties in the DY measurement are uncorrelated with these other processes. The latter have more complex topologies and thus have complementary and potentially larger systematic uncertainties.",

            "text": "A more detailed description of the CMS detector, together with a definition of the coordinate system and the relevant kinematic variables, can be found in Ref. [12]. The central feature of the CMS apparatus is a superconducting solenoid of 6 m internal diameter, providing a magnetic field of 3.8 T. Within the solenoid volume are a silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead tungsten crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL), and a brass/scintillator hadron calorimeter (HCAL), each composed of a barrel and two endcap sections. Muons are measured in gas-ionisation detectors embedded in the steel flux-return yoke outside the solenoid.

This is an open access article under the CC BY license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). Funded by SCOAP 3 . calorimetry complements the coverage provided by the barrel and endcap detectors. Muons are measured in the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 2.4, with detection planes made using three technologies: drift tubes, cathode strip chambers, and resistive-plate chambers. Matching muons to tracks measured in the silicon tracker results in a relative p T resolution of 1.3-2.0% in the barrel and better than 6% in the endcaps, for muons with 20 < p T < 100 GeV. The p T resolution in the barrel is better than 10% for muons with p T up to 1 TeV [13]. The particle-flow event reconstruction [14,15] is used in this analysis. It works by reconstructing and identifying each particle with an optimised combination of all subdetector information. The energy of photons is directly obtained from the ECAL measurement, corrected for zero-suppression effects. The energy of electrons is determined from a combination of the track momentum at the main interaction vertex, the corresponding ECAL cluster energy, and the energy sum of all bremsstrahlung photons. The energy of muons is obtained from the corresponding track momentum. The energy of charged hadrons is determined from a combination of the track momentum and the corresponding ECAL and HCAL energies, corrected for zero-suppression effects, and calibrated for the nonlinear response of the calorimeters. Finally, the energy of neutral hadrons is obtained from the corresponding calibrated ECAL and HCAL energies. The first level of the CMS trigger system, composed of custom hardware processors, uses information from the calorimeters and muon detectors to select the most interesting events in a fixed time interval of less than 4 \u03bcs. The high-level trigger processor farm further decreases the event rate from around 100 kHz to around 400 Hz before data storage.",

The efficiencies for the tracking, the trigger, the muon isolation and identification are determined via a \"tag-and-probe\" method [34]. The tracking efficiency is measured in bins of \u03b7. The trigger efficiency is measured in bins of muon p T and \u03b7 for positive and negative muons separately. The identification efficiency is measured in bins of p T and \u03b7. In particular phase space regions, especially for higher q T , the second muon can often point opposite to the Z boson in the azimuthal plane. In that direction, the hadronic activity from the recoil of the Z boson is enhanced. Thus the second muon is often less isolated than the leading muon and the isolation depends on the event kinematics. For that reason, the requirement for the isolation of the second muon is looser than the requirement for the leading muon, and the efficiency is measured in variables reflecting the second muon direction with respect to the Z boson. Three variables for the second muon are chosen to measure this effect on the efficiency in data: the transverse momentum of the dimuon system q T , the cosine of the polar angle cos \u03b8 * and the azimuthal angle \u03c6 * . The two angles are measured in the Z boson rest frame, where the z axis is the Z boson flight direction. For cos(\u03b8 * ) = \u22121 the leptons are more likely to be close to the hadronic recoil. The azimuthal angle is chosen to be zero for the proton closest to the z axis in this frame. The isolation efficiency for the leading muon is measured in bins of p T and \u03b7.

The e\u03bc-channel selection uses the same trigger as the final sample, thus the same trigger efficiency scale factor is used. In addition, the tracking, the identification, and the isolation efficiency scale factors for the leading muon are applied. Electrons are selected if they have p T (e) > 20 GeV and |\u03b7(e)| < 2.1, which is similar to the fiducial regions of the muon selection. No data-to-simulation correction factors are applied to the electron identification since the effect on the final results is negligible. In order to enhance the statistical precision, the invariant mass range of the e\u03bc pairs is increased to [60, 120] GeV.

The jump in the size of the scale uncertainty between the first and the second bins in q T can be understood as a consequence of reducing the order of the calculation to NLO when the Z boson is produced in combination with a jet, which is the dominant process for q T > 20 GeV. While the scale uncertainties are smaller at low q T , the shape is not expected to match the data well since multiple soft gluon emissions are not modelled.
