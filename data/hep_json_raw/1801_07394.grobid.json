At high energies, in addition to the electromagnetic (photon) exchange, the electroweak bosons play important roles; the \u03b3/Z exchange induces neutral current (NC) DIS, while the W exchange results in charged current (CC) DIS, in which the outgoing neutrino is undetected and leaves a missing energy signature. The scattering is described by two kinematic variables, Q 2 , the squared momentum transfer between the lepton and hadron, and Bjorken x, the fraction of the nucleon momentum carried by the scattering parton.",

At very low-x below 10 \u22124 , there is no data to constrain the gluon distribution, which is expected to saturate somewhere. Also a lot of diffractive measurements can be done, using rapidity gap events or installing roman-pot type forward proton spectrometers 13 .",

A design of an ERL with 60 GeV electron beam is at an advanced state, and a demonstrator PERLE is proposed. An ep/eA energy frontier machine, with 100 times Q 2 reach and 1000 times integrated luminosity compared to HERA, will bring a rich physics program which is complementary to, and strengthens, the discovery programs at HL-LHC and FCC-hh. It has a different physics objectives from the Electron Ion Collider 15 (EIC) in US, which is a lower energy machine and focuses on spin and medium-x structure of nucleon and nuclei.",
