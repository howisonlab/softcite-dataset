            "text": "Ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions are used to study the nuclear matter at high temperature and pressure where the formation of the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP), a state of matter which consists of asymptotically free quarks and gluons, occurs. Open heavy flavours and quarkonia are produced at the early stages of the collision and might interact with the deconfined medium, making them ideal probes of the QGP. It was indeed predicted that in hot nuclear matter, charmonia are suppressed due to color screening of the heavy quarks potential [1]. Quarkonia can also be suppressed in absence of the QGP formation by Cold Nuclear Matter (CNM) effects. Proton-Nucleus collisions (pA or Ap), which are interesting by themselves, are therefore essential to interpret Nucleus-Nucleus data in order to disentangle QGP effects from CNM effects in those collisions. The main CNM effects affecting quarkonium production include initial-state nuclear effects on the parton densities (shadowing) [2], the initial-state parton energy loss and final-state energy loss (coherent energy loss) [3], the finalstate absorption of the pre-resonant heavy quark pair by the spectator nucleons (nuclear absorption) albeit small at LHC [4] and the final-state interaction of the quarkonium with the produced medium (comovers) [5]. Proton-nucleus collisions are also useful for the determination of nuclear parton distribution functions (nPDF) [6]. The measurement of the Z electroweak boson in pA and Ap collisions in the LHCb acceptance permits to probe low x A values 1 (2 \u00d7 10 \u22124 -3 \u00d710 \u22123 ) in the forward case, and high x A value (0.2-1.0) in the backward case for an energy scale Q 2 = M 2 Z . Such a measurement (the first performed at the LHC in pA collisions) should offer large constraining power to nPDF fits especially at small x A . Finally, two-particle angular correlations are interesting tools to probe collective effects in the dense environment of high-energy collisions. Thanks to the high particle density and multiplicities reached in pA collisions, of similar size to that of non central nucleus-nucleus collisions (AA), LHCb can investigate at forward rapidity the long-range correlation on the near side (ie the so-called ridge [7]) which was already observed in proton-proton (pp), proton-lead (pPb) and lead-lead (PbPb) collisions at mid-rapidity.",

The yields of prompt charmonia and charmonia from b-hadron decays are obtained, in each kinematic bin, from a simultaneous fit of the dimuon invariant mass and pseudo-proper time distributions (see Fig. 1 for the \u03c8(2S) signal). An unbinned extended maximum likelihood fit to the dimuon invariant mass of the \u03a5 candidates was performed to determine the signal yields of \u03a5(1S), \u03a5(2S) and \u03a5(3S).

The results are compared to several theoretical calculations of parton shadowing and of coherent energy loss with or without shadowing [2][3][4]16]. A strong suppression of prompt J/\u03c8 is observed at the forward rapidity which is compatible with most of the theoretical predictions. The comparison of prompt J/\u03c8 and \u03c8(2S) R pPb suggests that \u03c8(2S) are more suppressed than J/\u03c8, especially in the backward region. Models describing the J/\u03c8 data might still be able to describe the forward \u03c8(2S) suppression but are not able to reproduce the suppression in the backward region. This intriguing result could be a first indication that another CNM effect is at play. Recently, a theoretical calculation based on comovers scenario [5] tries to explain this behaviour. Figure 2 right shows the R pPb of J/\u03c8 and \u03c8(2S) from b-hadrons in the rapidity ranges -4.0 < y < -2.5 and 2.5 < y < 4.0. J/\u03c8 from b are slightly suppressed in the forward region and both models including the shadowing effect can describe the data. This is the first indication of the b-hadron production in pPb collisions. In the backward region, J/\u03c8 from b are slightly less suppressed than prompt J/\u03c8 as expected from the models, however models are in worse agreement with the J/\u03c8 from b data. Given the large experimental uncertainties on the \u03c8(2S) from b measurement, no conclusions can be made on the comparison of the \u03c8(2S) from b suppression with respect to the J/\u03c8 from b suppression.   3 left shows the measurement of R pPb for \u03a5(1S) as a function of rapidity [17] compared with the R pPb measurement of prompt J/\u03c8 and J/\u03c8 from b. \u03a5(1S) is suppressed in the forward region while there is an indication for an enhancement of \u03a5(1S) production with respect to pp in the backward region, which could be attributed to anti-shadowing. The R pPb measurement of \u03a5(1S ) agrees within uncertainties (albeit large in the backward region) with the R pPb measurement of J/\u03c8 from b, reflecting the fact that CNM effects affect the b-hadrons production. \u03a5(1S) data agree with coherent energy loss model including nuclear shadowing as parametrized with EPS09 [3]. A comparison with more models is available in Ref. [17]. Figure 3 right shows the forward-backward production ratio R FB as a function of rapidity for \u03a5(1S), prompt J/\u03c8 and J/\u03c8 from b. A smaller forward-backward asymmetry is observed for J/\u03c8 from b with respect to prompt J/\u03c8. The forward backward asymmetry measurement of \u03a5(1S) and prompt J/\u03c8 agree with theoretical calculation of coherent energy loss with nuclear shadowing parametrized with EPS09 [3].",

They were studied in event-activity classes, which are defined as fractions of the VELO hit-multiplicity distributions in a minimum bias sample. In events with high event-activity a longrange correlation on the near side, the so-called ridge, is observed both in the forward and backward configurations, for 1 < p T < 2 GeV/c, while it is not observed in the 50-100% event-activity class (see Fig. 4 for the backward case). It was also observed that when probing identical absolute activity ranges in the pPb and Pbp configurations, the observed long-range correlations are compatible with each other (albeit there is a shift of one unit in rapidity coverage between both configurations).",

The production of prompt J/\u03c8, \u03c8(2S ), J/\u03c8 and \u03c8(2S) from b and \u03a5 has been measured in pPb collisions at \u221a s NN = 5 TeV. J/\u03c8 from b and \u03a5(1S) are less affected by cold nuclear matter effects than prompt J/\u03c8 which exhibits a stronger suppression. Prompt \u03c8(2S) seems even more suppressed than prompt J/\u03c8, especially in the backward region. Models of coherent energy loss with and without nuclear shadowing effects give a good description of the data, except for the production of \u03c8(2S) in the backward region. The prompt \u03c8(2S) data suggest that another CNM effect could be at play in the backward region. LHCb also performed the first measurement of Z production in pPb collisions at the LHC and the current analysis with limited statistical precision, will highly benefit from the larger statistics data sample which will be collected during run 2. Thanks to two-particle correlation analysis, LHCb observed for the first time the ridge in the forward region, in pPb collisions, thus complementing measurement at midrapidity from other experiments. The LHCb dectector will also collect for the first time PbPb data at \u221a s NN = 5 TeV at the end of 2015. LHCb will thus lead a rich physics program covering heavy flavour physics, electroweak physics, soft QCD physics and Quark Gluon Plasma studies. It is expected to collect L int \u2248 50-80 \u03bcb\u00af1 at the end of 2015. In addition, LHCb is in the unique position at the LHC to perform fixed target physics. Thanks to its System for Measuring Overlap with Gas (SMOG), initially used as luminosity monitor, noble gases can be injected inside the inner tracker of LHCb. With the proton and lead beams delivered by the LHC, and the various species of gas which can be injected in LHCb, a large number of fixed target configurations can be studied. LHCb already successfully collected proton-helium, proton-neon, proton-argon, lead-neon data and a lead-argon data taking is foreseen in parallel of the 2015 PbPb data taking. The highest center-of-mass energy which can be achieved in proton-gas collisions is \u221a s NN = 115 GeV while in lead-gas collision it is \u221a s NN = 72",

The results are compared to several theoretical calculations of parton shadowing and of coherent energy loss with or without shadowing[2][3][4]16]. A strong suppression of prompt J/\u03c8 is observed at the forward rapidity which is compatible with most of the theoretical predictions. The comparison of prompt J/\u03c8 and \u03c8(2S) R pPb suggests that \u03c8(2S) are more suppressed than J/\u03c8, especially in the backward region. Models describing the J/\u03c8 data might still be able to describe the forward \u03c8(2S) suppression but are not able to reproduce the suppression in the backward region. This intriguing result could be a first indication that another CNM effect is at play. Recently, a theoretical calculation based on comovers scenario[5] tries to explain this behaviour.Figure 2right shows the R pPb of J/\u03c8 and \u03c8(2S) from b-hadrons in the rapidity ranges -4.0 < y < -2.5 and 2.5 < y < 4.0. J/\u03c8 from b are slightly suppressed in the forward region and both models including the shadowing effect can describe the data. This is the first indication of the b-hadron production in pPb collisions. In the backward region, J/\u03c8 from b are slightly less suppressed than prompt J/\u03c8 as expected from the models, however models are in worse agreement with the J/\u03c8 from b data. Given the large experimental uncertainties on the \u03c8(2S) from b measurement, no conclusions can be made on the comparison of the \u03c8(2S) from b suppression with respect to the J/\u03c8 from b suppression.Figure",
