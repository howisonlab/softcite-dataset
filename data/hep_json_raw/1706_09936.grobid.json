A data sample of proton-proton collisions at \u221a s = 13 TeV, collected with the CMS detector at the LHC and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 is used. The signal strength modifier \u00b5, defined as the ratio of the observed Higgs boson rate in the H \u2192 ZZ \u2192 4 decay channel to the standard model expectation, is measured to be \u00b5 = 1.05 +0.19   \u22120.17 at m H = 125.09 GeV, the combined ATLAS and CMS measurement of the Higgs boson mass. The signal strength modifiers for the individual Higgs boson production modes are also measured. The cross section in the fiducial phase space defined by the requirements on lepton kinematics and event topology is measured to be 2.92 +0.48   \u22120.44 (stat) +0.28 \u22120.24 (syst) fb, which is compatible with the standard model prediction of 2.76 \u00b1 0.14 fb. Differential cross sections are reported as a function of the transverse momentum of the Higgs boson, the number of associated jets, and the transverse momentum of the leading associated jet. The Higgs boson mass is measured to be m H = 125.26 \u00b1 0.21 GeV and the width is constrained using the on-shell invariant mass distribution to be \u0393 H < 1.10 GeV, at 95% confidence level.",

Collision events are selected by high-level trigger algorithms that require the presence of leptons passing loose identification and isolation requirements. The main triggers of this analysis select either a pair of electrons or muons, or an electron and a muon. The minimal transverse momentum with respect to the beam axis of the leading electron (muon) is 23 (17) GeV, while that of the subleading lepton is 12 (8) GeV. To maximize the signal acceptance, triggers requiring three leptons with lower p T thresholds and no isolation requirement are also used, as are isolated singleelectron and single-muon triggers with the thresholds of 27 GeV and 22 GeV, respectively. The overall trigger efficiency for simulated signal events that pass the full selection chain of this analysis (described in section 4) is larger than 99%. The trigger efficiency is measured in data with a method based on the \"tag-and-probe\" technique [29] using a sample of 4 events collected by the single-lepton triggers. Leptons passing the single-lepton triggers are used as tags and the other three leptons are used as probes. The efficiency in data is found to be in agreement with the expectation from simulation.",

The expression d\u03b7 J P VBF is the integral of the two-jet VBF matrix element probability density discussed above over the \u03b7 J values of the unobserved jet with the constraint that the total transverse momentum of the H + 2 jets system is zero. By construction, all discriminants defined in eqs. (5.1) and (5.2) have values bounded between 0 and 1. The uncertainty in the momentum measurement can be predicted for each lepton. For muons, the full covariance matrix is obtained from the muon track fit, and the directional uncertainties are negligibly small. For the electrons, the momentum uncertainty is estimated from the combination of the ECAL and tracker measurements, neglecting the uncertainty in the track direction. The uncertainty in the kinematics at the per-lepton level is then propagated to the four-lepton candidate to predict the mass uncertainty (D mass ) on an event-by-event basis. For FSR photons, a parametrization obtained from simulation is used for the uncertainty in the photon p T . The per-lepton momentum uncertainties are corrected in data and simulation using Z boson events. Events are divided into different categories based on the predicted dilepton mass resolution. A Breit-Wigner parameterization convolved with a double-sided Crystal Ball function [59] is then fit to the dilepton mass distribution in each category to extract the resolution and compare it to the predicted resolution. Corrections to the lepton momentum uncertainty are derived through an iterative procedure in different bins of lepton p T and \u03b7. After the corrections are derived, a closure test of the agreement between the predicted and fitted 4 mass resolution is performed in data and in simulation, in bins of the predicted 4 mass resolution, confirming that the calibration brings it close to the fitted value. A systematic uncertainty of 20% in the 4 mass resolution is assigned to cover the residual differences between the predicted and fitted resolutions.",

The shape of the m 4 distribution for the reducible background is obtained by combining the prediction from the OS and SS methods and fitting the distributions with empirical functional forms built from Landau [68] and exponential distributions. The dominant systematic uncertainty in the reducible background estimation arises from the limited number of events in the control regions as well as in the region where the misidentification rate is applied. Additional sources of systematic uncertainty, estimated using simulated samples, come from the fact that the composition of the regions used to JHEP11(2017)047 compute the misidentification rates typically differs from that of control regions where they are applied. The subdominant systematic uncertainty in the m 4 shape is determined by taking the envelope of differences among the shapes from the OS and SS methods in the three different final states.

Each parameter of the double-sided Crystal Ball function is given a linear dependence on m H for a total of 12 free parameters. Of these parameters, 10 are left free in the simultaneous fits.

The systematic uncertainty is then taken as the difference in quadrature between the total uncertainty and the statistical uncertainty.

The WH and ZH processes are merged, and then split based on the decay of the associated vector boson into either hadronic decays (VHhad) or leptonic decays (VHlep). The results are reported in figure 8 (top right) and compared to the expected signal strength modifiers in table 3. The expected uncertainties are evaluated by generating an Asimov data set [73], which is a representative event sample that provides both the median expectation for an experimental result and its expected statistical variation, in the asymptotic approximation. The coverage of the quoted intervals has been verified for a subset of results using the Feldman-Cousins method [74]. The low observed signal strengths for the VBF, VH, and ttH processes can be explained by the mild excess in the untagged category, which leads to a higher than expected signal strength for the gg \u2192 H process that contributes significantly to the total signal yield in categories that are based on the hadronic activity in the event. In the categories that are not based on hadronic event activity, events with m 4 near 125 GeV have low D kin bkg values, and are therefore more compatible with the background than the signal hypothesis.",

The separation of the production processes is achieved through the categorization of events described in section 6. This measurement corresponds to the 'stage-0' simplified template cross sections from ref. [34]. This approach allows one to reduce the dependence of the measurements on the theoretical uncertainties in the SM predictions, avoiding extrapolation of the measurements to the full phase space which carries nontrivial or sizeable theoretical uncertainties. The measured cross sections, normalized to the SM prediction [34], which is denoted as \u03c3 theo , are shown in figure 9. The dominant sources of experimental systematic uncertainty are the same as in the measurement of the signal strength modifier, while the dominant theoretical source is the uncertainty in the category migration for the gluon fusion process. The cross section for the production and decay pp \u2192 H \u2192 4 in a tight fiducial phase space is also presented. This measurement has minimal dependence on the assumptions of the relative fraction or kinematic distributions of the separate production modes. The definition of the generator-level fiducial volume, chosen to match closely the reconstructionlevel selection, is very similar to the definition used in ref. [22]. The differences with respect to ref. [22] are that leptons are defined as \"dressed\" leptons, as opposed to Born-level leptons, and the lepton isolation criterion is updated to match the reconstruction-level selection. Leptons are \"dressed\" by adding the four-momenta of photons within \u2206R < 0.3 to the bare leptons, and leptons are considered isolated if the scalar sum of transverse momenta of all stable particles, excluding electrons, muons, and neutrinos, within \u2206R < 0.3 from the lepton is less than 0.35p T (GeV).

The nominal result for JHEP11(2017)047 the mass measurement is obtained from the 3D fit with the m(Z 1 ) constraint, for which the fitted value of m H in the three subchannels is m 4\u00b5 H = 124.94 \u00b1 0.25 (stat) \u00b1 0.08 (syst) GeV, m 4e H = 124.37 \u00b1 0.62 (stat) \u00b1 0.38 (syst) GeV, and m 2e2\u00b5 H = 125.95 \u00b1 0.32 (stat) \u00b1 0.14 (syst) GeV leading to a combined value m H = 125.26\u00b10.20 (stat)\u00b10.08 (syst) GeV. The systematic uncertainty in the mass measurement is completely dominated by the uncertainty in the lepton momentum scale. The expected uncertainty in the mass measurement using the 3D fit with the m(Z 1 ) constraint is evaluated with two Asimov data sets. The \"prefit\" expected uncertainty is \u00b10.24 (stat) \u00b1 0.09 (syst) GeV. Here m H = 125 GeV, \u00b5 = 1, and all nuisance parameters are fixed to their nominal values. The \"postfit\" expected uncertainty with m H , \u00b5, and all nuisance parameters fixed to their best-fit estimates from the data is \u00b10.23 (stat) \u00b1 0.08 (syst) GeV. The probability of the \"prefit\" uncertainty being less than or equal to the observed value is determined from an ensemble of pseudo-experiments to be about 18%. The mutual compatibility of the m H results from the three individual channels is tested using a likelihood ratio with three masses in the numerator and a common mass in the denominator, and thus two degrees of freedom. The signal strength is profiled in both the numerator and denominator. The resulting compatibility, defined as the asymptotic p-value of the fit, is 2.5%. The tension between the three individual channels is driven by the difference between the 4\u00b5 and 2e2\u00b5 channels, where the compatibility of the 1D mass measurements without the m(Z 1 ) constraint is 8%. In the 1D mass measurement the main potential source of systematic bias is the lepton momentum scale; this possibility is disfavored by the fact that the measured mass in the 2e2\u00b5 channel is not in between the measurements in the 4e and 4\u00b5 channels. This bias has also been checked by performing the 1D mass measurements without the m(Z 1 ) constraint using Z \u2192 4 events, and the resulting mass is measured to be m 4\u00b5 Z = 90.85\u00b10.27 (stat)\u00b10.04 (syst) GeV, m 4e Z = 90.85\u00b10.74 (stat)\u00b10.28 (syst) GeV, and m 2e2\u00b5 Z = 90.61\u00b10.48 (stat)\u00b10.10 (syst) GeV leading to a combined value m Z = 90.84 \u00b1 0.23 (stat) \u00b1 0.07 (syst) GeV. The compatibility with the nominal Z-boson mass from ref. [57] is 14% and the mutual compatibility between the three individual channels is 90%. The modelling of the event-by-event mass uncertainties is a possible source of systematic bias in the 2D and 3D measurements. It is checked by performing a Kolmogorov-Smirnov compatibility test of the expected and observed distributions in an expanded m 4 range yielding p-values of 10% for the 2e2\u00b5 channel, 55% for the 4e channel, and 94% for the 4\u00b5 channel.",
