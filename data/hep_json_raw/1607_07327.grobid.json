In the sensitive band of AURIGA, some 100 Hz at around 1 kHz, the expected signal, with a Q = f f \u223c 10 6 , is a narrow peak, f \u223c 1 mHz. Here the detector strain sensitivity is hs \u223c 2 \u00d7 10 \u221221 Hz \u22121/2 , within a factor of 2.

AURIGA represents the state-of-art in the class of gravitational wave cryogenic resonant-mass detectors. It is located at INFN National Laboratory of Legnaro (Italy) and has been in continuous operation since year 2004. The detector is based on a 2.2 \u00d7 10 3 kg, 3 m long bar made of low-loss aluminum alloy (Al5056), cooled to liquid helium temperatures. The fundamental longitudinal mode of the bar, sensitive to the moduli induced oscillation, has an effective mass M = 1.1 \u00d7 10 3 kg and a resonance frequency \u03c9 B /2\u03c0 900 Hz. The bar resonator motion is detected by a displacement sensor with a sensitivity of order several 10 \u221220 m \u2022 Hz \u22121/2 over a \u223c 100 Hz bandwidth. The spectral noise floor in the relative deformation for the fundamental longitudinal mode, for the frequency interval of maximum sensitivity is given in fig. (2). This sensitivity is accomplished by a multimode resonant capacitive transducer [5] combined with a very low noise dc SQUID amplifier [6]  (Fig. 1). In this scheme, the bar resonator is coupled to the fundamental flexural mode of a mushroom-shaped lighter resonator, with 6 kg effective mass and the same resonance frequency. As the mechanical energy is transferred from the bar to the lighter resonator, the motion is magnified by a factor of roughly 15. A capacitive transducer, biased with a static electric field of 10 7 V/m, converts the differential motion between bar and mushroom resonator into an electrical current, which is finally detected by a low noise dc SQUID amplifier through a low-loss high-ratio superconducting transformer [7]. The transducer efficiency is further increased by placing the resonance frequency of the electrical LC circuit close to the mechanical resonance frequencies [5], at 930 Hz. The detector can then be simply modeled as a system of three coupled resonators: its dynamics is described by three normal modes at separate frequencies, each one being a superposition of the bar and transducer mechanical resonators and the LC electrical resonator [8].",

A calibration function obtained by a thorough mechanical characterization of the system [8] is then used to convert data from electrical potential difference to relative deformation h of the AURIGA bar length.

Computed power spectrums are averaged to reduce the noise standard deviation and achieve a better sensitivity. If N is the number of averaged power spectrums, the variance of the noise is N 1/2 [9], and the corresponding standard deviation on h decreases with the number of averages as N 1/4 . Thus, a good sensitivity on the moduli signal is already achieved with few weeks of data.

AURIGA detector has been running in stable conditions during this period: stability of the detector is inferred by the stable frequencies and shape of the three main detector's modes, checked by studying the evolution of the detector power spectrum on the analyzed dataset. Spikes in time due to energetic background events could hide a possible signal from moduli and must be removed from the dataset: for each data stream in the time domain the rms is computed, obtaining a distribution of the rms value for the whole dataset; data affected by energetic background lie in the high value tail of the distribution.

(9) are ordered following a specific ordering function, as reported in [10], in order to avoid problems on the parameter estimation near the physical bounds of such parameters. Eq. (9) states that for a fixed hypothetical signal strength \u00b5, the observed value of the bin contentx falls within the interval (x 1 (\u00b5), x 2 (\u00b5)) with a probability equal to \u03b1. Thus, for each measured value ofx the upper and lower limits on the measured signal strength, containing the true value \u00b5 with a 95% probability, is obtained by inversion of the constructed confidence belt. We set a threshold,x th , corresponding to a maximum false alarm probability of finding a signal, which is not actually there, equal to 3 standard deviations away from the background only hypothesis. For observed values ofx belowx th we set an upper limit on the signal strain. Values above the threshold x th would correspond to an observed signal. Since in our measurement in fig. (2) we do not observe values exceeding the threshold, we set upper limits on h at 95% confidence level. Interpreting these upper limits as given by moduli through eq. 5, we convert these values in upper limits on the moduli coupling d me to ordinary matter. To improve the upper limits, we exploited the noise curve obtained adding the thermal noise prediction from Fluctuation-Dissipation theorem and the noise contribution from the SQUID. By performing a least squares fit of data in fig. (2), we obtained the upper limits at 95% C.L. from the \u03c7 2 distribution. This allows to get better upper limits by taking into account a more precise estimation of errors from the fit. Further improvement is obtained by averaging bins in groups of 10 for data in fig. (2), since the signal would be distributed around \u223c 10 bins, as shown by fig. (3).",

The upper limits set on the moduli coupling to ordinary matter are better then d i 10 \u22125 in the sensitive band of AURIGA, f = [850, 950] Hz, and explore an interesting physical region of the parameter space, within the natural parameter space for moduli [1]. With this result we prove that AURIGA, a gravitational wave resonant detector, would be capable to detect light DM candidates with an interesting sensitivity within its bandwidth. We point out that this level of sensitivity can be achieved only by resonant mass detectors, and not by modern laser interferometers developed for gravitational wave detection, such as LIGO [11] and Virgo [12], even if these have better sensitivity than resonant mass detectors for gravitational waves and recently observed the first event due to a gravitational wave signal [13]. In fact, because of the monopole nature of the expected moduli strain, we do not expect an interference signal as output from the interferometer due to moduli. Instead, since ultralight scalars can mediate Yukawa forces between objects, one can explore which is the expected effect on the relative position between mirrors within an interferometer arm [14]. The moduli signal could be measured as a difference in the travel time between the mirrors. It turns out that the sensitivity is masked by detector noise, therefore resulting in a lower searching power with respect to resonant mass detectors.",
