            "text": "We report the result from the first search for D 0 decays to invisible final states. The analysis is performed on a data sample of 924 fb \u22121 collected at and near the \u03a5(4S) and \u03a5(5S) resonances with the Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric-energy e + e \u2212 collider. The absolute branching fraction is determined using an inclusive D 0 sample, obtained by fully reconstructing the rest of the particle system including the other charmed particle. No significant signal yield is observed and an upper limit of 9.4 \u00d7 10 \u22125 is set on the branching fraction of D 0 to invisible final states at 90% confidence level. In the Standard Model (SM), heavy (D or B) meson decay to \u03bd\u03bd is helicity suppressed [1] with an expected branching fraction of B(D 0 \u2192 \u03bd\u03bd) = 1.1 \u00d7 10 \u221230 [2], which is beyond the reach of current collider experiments. The branching fraction may be enhanced by non-SM mechanisms such as the decay of D and B mesons to dark matter (DM) final states with and without an additional light meson in the final states, as estimated in Ref. [1]. With several DM candidates [3,4], the branching fraction of D 0 to invisible final states could be enhanced to O(10 \u221215 ).",

Large Monte Carlo (MC) samples for signal and several backgrounds are generated with EvtGen [18] and simulated with GEANT3 [19] with the configurations of the Belle detector. These samples are used to obtain expected distributions of various physical quantities for signal and background, to optimize the selection criteria, and to determine the signal selection efficiency.

The four types of D tag are reconstructed using 23 decay modes. (D * tag candidates are described later.)

However, possible imperfection of functional form and the correlation between M D 0 and E ECL PDFs may cause systematic bias in the signal yield. The uncertainty due to such a possible yield bias is estimated by an MC ensemble test with an assumed branching fraction of zero. The uncertainties due to the shape-fixed PDF in the fit are obtained from the signal yield change when varying the PDF shape. For the signal PDF in E ECL , the histogram PDF is varied by the data-MC difference in the E ECL distribution of the D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + control sample. For the D 0 background PDF in E ECL , we vary the first-bin content of the histograms by \u00b11\u03c3 of the branching fraction of the D 0 decay modes, where \u03c3 denotes the measurement error on the branching fraction. For the non-D 0 background PDF in E ECL , we find that the MC can describe data well in the region M D 0 < 1.855 GeV/c 2 , and the histogram PDF is also varied by the data-MC difference in the E ECL distribution in this region. For the signal PDF in M D 0 , we vary the shape parameters by \u00b11\u03c3, where \u03c3 denotes standard deviation of the shape parameters obtained by the fit on M D 0 distribution of the inclusive D 0 sample. For the non-D 0 background PDF in M D 0 , we float the end-point in the fit and the signal yield variation is found to be negligible. Since the observed yield for D 0 \u2192 invisible is not significant, we calculate a 90% confidence level Bayesian upper limit on the branching fraction (B UL ) [22]. The upper limit is obtained by integrating the likelihood function: where L(B) denotes the likelihood value.
