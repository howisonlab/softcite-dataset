Particle identification is performed using the specific energy loss in the inner tracking silicon detector and the time projection chamber. In addition, time-of-flight information is used to identify hadrons at higher momenta. Finally, the distinctive kink topology of the weak decay of charged kaons is used for an alternative measurement of the kaon transverse momentum (p t ) spectra. Since these various particle identification tools give the best separation capabilities over different momentum ranges, the results are combined to extract spectra from p t = 100 MeV/c to 2.5 GeV/c. The measured spectra are further compared with QCD-inspired models which yield a poor description. The total yields and the mean p t are compared with previous measurements, and the trends as a function of collision energy are discussed. ",

            "text": "In pp collisions at ultra-relativistic energies the bulk of the particles produced at mid-rapidity have transverse momenta, p t , below 1 GeV/c. Their production is not calculable from first principles via perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics, and is not well modelled at lower collision energies. This low p t particle production, and species composition, must therefore be measured, providing crucial input for the modelling of hadronic interactions and the hadronization process. It is important to study the bulk production of particles as a function of both p t and particle species. With the advent of pp collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN a new energy regime is being explored, where particle production from hard interactions which are predominantly gluonic in nature, is expected to play an increasing role. Such data will provide extra constraints on the modelling of fragmentation functions. The data will also serve as a reference for the heavy-ion measurements.",

The ITS is also used as a stand-alone tracker to reconstruct charged particles with momenta below 200 MeV/c that are deflected or decay before reaching the TPC, and to recover tracks crossing dead regions of the TPC. A detailed description of the three sub-systems can be found in [3]. The dE/dx measurement in the SDD and SSD has been calibrated using cosmic ray data and pp events [5]. The 2198 ITS modules have been aligned using survey information, cosmic-ray tracks and pp data with the methods described in [6].

In order to reduce the extrapolation and thus the systematic uncertainty on the normalization, the sample of selected events used for normalization includes triggered events without reconstructed tracks or vertices. Those events still contain a small contamination from very low multiplicity beam-induced background or accidentals from the trigger, which are not rejected by the selections described above. This contamination is of the order of 4% and is subtracted using the control triggers. From the analysis of empty bunch events the random contribution from cosmic rays is found to be negligible. The number of selected events is then converted to the number of inelastic collisions after correcting for the trigger efficiency, which is determined from the Monte-Carlo simulation, scaling the cross section for diffractive processes to the measurements of UA5 [14]. The subtraction of beam-gas events and the efficiency correction partially compensate each other: the overall correction factor is about 5% with a systematic uncertainty of about 2%, coming mainly from the uncertainties in the modelling of diffraction in the event generators.",

To ensure high tracking efficiency and dE/dx-resolution, while keeping the contamination from secondaries and fakes low, tracks are required to have at least 80 clusters, and a \u03c7 2 of the momentum fit that is smaller than 4 per cluster. Since each cluster in the TPC provides two degrees of freedom and the number of parameters of the track fit is much smaller than the number of clusters, the \u03c7 2 cut is approximately 2 per degree of freedom. In addition, at least two clusters in the ITS must be associated to the track, out of which at least one is from the SPD. Tracks are further rejected based on their distance-ofclosest approach (DCA) to the reconstructed event vertex. The cut is implemented as a function of p t to correspond to about seven (five) standard deviations in the transverse (longitudinal) coordinate, taking into account the p t -dependence of the impact parameter resolution. These selection criteria are tuned to select primary charged particles with high efficiency while minimizing the contributions from weak decays, conversions and secondary hadronic interactions in the detector material.

This compensates for the very steep slope of the Bethe-Bloch in the 1/\u03b2 2 region which would make the dE/dx-distribution in a simple p t or p-slice non-Gaussian.

For each track, dE/dx is calculated using a truncated mean: the average of the lowest two points in case four points are measured, or a weighted sum of the lowest (weight 1) and the second lowest point (weight 1/2), in case only three points are measured. Figure 1 shows the truncated mean dE/dx for the sample of ITS stand-alone tracks along with the PHOBOS parametrization of the most probable value [23]. For the ITS stand-alone track sample, the histograms are fitted with three Gaussians and the integral of the Gaussian centered at zero is used as the raw yield of the corresponding hadron species. In a first step, the peak widths \u03c3 of the peaks are extracted as a function of p t for pions and protons in the region where their dE/dx distributions do not overlap with the kaon (and electron) distribution. For kaons, the same procedure is used at low p t , where they are well separated. The p t -dependence of the peak width is then extrapolated to higher p t with the same functional form used to describe the pions and protons.

Efficiency correction The raw hadron spectra are corrected for the reconstruction efficiency, shown in Fig. 6, determined by doing the same analysis on Monte-Carlo events. The efficiency is calculated by comparing the number of reconstructed particles to the number of charged primary particles from PYTHIA in the chosen rapidity range. For transverse momenta above 800 MeV/c the efficiency saturates at roughly 80%. For kaons, the decay reduces the efficiency by about 30% at 250 MeV/c and 12% at 1.5 GeV/c. The range with a reconstruction efficiency lower than 60% (for pions and protons) is omitted for the analysis corresponding to a low-p t cut-off of 200 MeV/c for pions, 250 MeV/c for kaons, and 400 MeV/c for protons. Protons are corrected for the contamination of secondaries from material and of feed down from weak decays. The feed down was determined by two independent methods. Firstly, the contamination obtained from Monte-Carlo simulation was scaled such that it corresponds to the measured yield of \u039bs in the data [24]. Secondly, the shape of the impact parameter distribution was compared to the Monte-Carlo simulation. Weak decays produce a non-Gaussian tail in the distribution of primary particles whereas secondaries from material generate a flat background [22]. The remaining difference between the methods is included in the systematic error. The correction for weak decays amounts to up to 14% and the correction for secondaries from material up to 4% for protons with 400 MeV/c < p t < 600 MeV/c. For other particle species and other transverse momenta the contamination is negligible.",

Using this procedure, the start-time has been improved for 44% of the tracks having an associated TOF signal and is rather independent on the momentum of the tracks. In this way the precision on the event start-time is about 85 ps on average. Finally, tracks whose particle identity as determined from the TOF information is not compatible with the one inferred from the dE/dx signal in the TPC within five \u03c3 have been removed.

The analyses from the different detectors use a slightly different sample of tracks and have largely independent systematics (mainly coming from the PID method and the contamination from secondaries). The spectra have been averaged, using the systematic errors as weights. From this weighted average, the combined, p t -dependent, systematic error is derived.

            "text": "Our values on yield and p t given in Tables 4 and 5 agree well with the results from pp collisions at the same \u221a s [31]. Figure 15 compares the p t with measurements in pp collisions at \u221a s = 200 GeV [32,33] and in pp reactions at \u221a s = 900 GeV [31]. The mean p t rises very little with increasing \u221a s despite the fact that the spectral shape clearly shows an increasing contribution from hard processes. It was already observed at RHIC that the increase in mean p t at \u221a s = 200 GeV compared to studies at \u221a s = 25 GeV is small. The values obtained in pp collisions are lower than those for central Au+Au reactions at \u221a s = 200 GeV [32]. The spectra presented in this paper are normalized to inelastic events. In a similar study by the STAR Collaboration the yields have been normalized to NSD collisions [32]. In order to compare these two results, the yields in Table 4 have been scaled to NSD events, multiplying by 1.185 (see Sect. 2.2). The yields of pions increase from \u221a s = 200 GeV to 900 GeV by 23%, while K + rises by 45% and K \u2212 by 48%. Fig. 15 (Color online) Mean p t as a function of the mass of the emitted particle in pp collisions at 900 GeV (ALICE, red solid circles, statistical and systematic errors) compared to results at \u221a s = 200 GeV (star markers, average values of the results from the STAR and the PHENIX Collaborations [32,33]) and pp reactions at \u221a s = 900 GeV [31] (open squares). Some data points are displaced for clarity Figure 16 shows the K/\u03c0 ratio as a function of \u221a s both in pp (full symbols, [32,34,35]) and in pp (open symbols, [36][37][38]) collisions. For most energies, (K + + K \u2212 )/ (\u03c0 + + \u03c0 \u2212 ) is plotted, but for some cases only neutral  [37] and at the TEVATRON by E735 [36,38]) mesons were measured and K 0 /\u03c0 0 is used instead. The p t -integrated (K + + K \u2212 )/(\u03c0 + + \u03c0 \u2212 ) ratio shows a slight increase from \u221a s = 200 GeV (K/\u03c0 = 0.103 \u00b1 0.008) to \u221a s = 900 GeV (K/\u03c0 = 0.123 \u00b1 0.004 \u00b1 0.010) [32], yet consistent within the error bars. The results at 7 TeV will show whether the K/\u03c0 ratio keeps rising slowly as a function of \u221a s or saturates. Protons and antiprotons in Table 4 have been corrected for feed down (mainly from \u039b), while the results from the STAR Collaboration are not. The proton spectra measured by PHENIX, on the other hand, have a lower p t -cut of 0.6 GeV/c. This makes a direct comparison with RHIC data difficult. Figure 17 shows a comparison of the measured pion, kaon and proton spectra with several tunes of the PYTHIA event generator [15] and with PHOJET [18]. The PYTHIA CSC 306 [39] tune provides a very poor description of the particle spectra for all species. Similar deviations were already seen for the unidentified charged hadron spectra [13]. The other PYTHIA tunes, Perugia0 [30] and D6T [16], and PHOJET give a reasonable description of the charged pion spectra, but show large deviations in the kaon and proton spectra. The measured kaon p t -spectrum falls more slowly with increasing p t than the event generators predict. A similar trend is seen for the proton spectra, except for PYTHIA tune D6T, which describes the proton spectra reasonably well.",

            "text": "The upper panel of Fig. 18 shows the p t -dependence of the K/\u03c0 and also the measurements by the E735 [36] and STAR Collaborations [32]. It can be seen that the observed increase of K/\u03c0 with p t does not depend strongly on collision energy. A comparison with event generators shows that at p t > 1.2 GeV/c, the measured K/\u03c0 ratio is larger than any of the model predictions. It is interesting to note that while the spectra in the CSC tune are much steeper than the other tunes, the p t -dependence of the K/\u03c0 ratio is very similar. In the models, the amount of strangeness production depends on the production ratios of gluons and the different quark flavours in the hard scattering and on the strangeness suppression in the string breaking. The latter could probably be tuned to better describe the data. A similar disagreement between measured strangeness production and PYTHIA predictions was found at RHIC energies [40].",

Both measurements are feed-down corrected. At low p t , there is no energy-dependence of the p/\u03c0 ratio visible, while at higher p t > 1 GeV/c, the p/\u03c0 ratio is larger at \u221a s = 900 GeV than at \u221a s = 200 GeV energy. Event generators seem to separate into two groups, one with high p/\u03c0 ratio (PYTHIA CSC and D6T), which agree better with the data and one group with a lower p/\u03c0 ratio (PHOJET and PYTHIA Perugia0), which are clearly below the measured values. These comparisons can be used for future tunes of baryon production in the event generators.",
