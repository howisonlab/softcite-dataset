            "text": "We are at the dawn of a new era in the study of hadronic nuclear physics. The non-Abelian nature of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) and the resulting strong coupling at low energies represent a significant challenge to nuclear and particle physicists. The last decade has seen the development of new theoretical and experimental tools to quantitatively study the nature of confinement and the structure of hadrons comprised of light quarks and gluons. Together these will allow both the spectrum and the structure of hadrons to be elucidated in unprecedented detail. Exotic mesons that result from excitation of the gluon field will be explored. Multidimensional images of hadrons with great promise to reveal the dynamics of the key underlying degrees of freedom will be produced. In particular, these multidimensional distributions open a new window on the elusive spin content of the nucleon through observables that are directly related to the orbital angular momenta of quarks and gluons. Moreover, computational techniques in Lattice QCD now promise to provide insightful and quantitative predictions that can be meaningfully confronted with, and elucidated by, forthcoming experimental data. In addition, the development of extremely high intensity, highly polarized and extraordinarily stable beams of electrons provides innovative opportunities for probing (and extending) the Standard Model, both through parity violation studies and searches for new particles. Thus the 12 GeV upgrade of the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF) at Jefferson Lab will enable a new experimental program with substantial discovery potential to address these and other important topics in nuclear, hadronic and electroweak physics.",

Although lower luminosity beams of electrons and photons in the energy range of the upgraded CEBAF have been previously available, the new facility at Jefferson Lab capitalizes on remarkable developments in experimental techniques over the last decade. Even at the advent of CEBAF operations in 1995, one could only dream of the availability of highly polarized (86%) continuous wave (CW) beam with intensities up to 180 \u03bcA, as have been delivered during the last year. The revolutionary construction and operation of the CEBAF Large Acceptance Spectrometer (CLAS) has proved that large acceptance devices can be successfully operated in the environment of an external CW electron beam, and the advent of new detector technologies and high rate electronics offer a powerful combination of experimental tools that far exceed the capability of previous experiments and facilities.",

The PAC was charged to only approve proposals that were considered to be rated in the top 50% of anticipated experiments, so the approved program represents an above average standard. Interest in the 12 GeV science program has been tremendous, and there are presently 52 approved proposals, each with a scientific rating and recommended allocation of beam time (see Appendix B for a list). This set of approved experiments will require more than 6 years of running the upgraded facility at near-full efficiency, extending scientific productivity well into the 2020's. The PAC continues to meet on an annual basis to consider new proposals. In addition, the user community is considering various additions to the experimental equipment under construction, and these are also briefly discussed in Appendix A.",

Driven by the inadequacies of previous treatments and by recent experimental data, we are now moving beyond the simple one dimensional parton distribution functions of the past. The pioneering efforts of HERMES and COMPASS, together with the 6 GeV Jefferson Lab, have demonstrated the feasibility of studying Transverse Momentum Distributions (TMDs) as well as Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering (DVCS) measurements that offer access to Generalized Parton Distributions (GPDs). Indeed, recent measurements using the 6 GeV CEBAF have demonstrated that high quality CW polarized electron beams with a combination of large acceptance and precision detectors are powerful tools to attack these new observables. We can now be confident that the extended kinematic range and new experimental hardware associated with the Jefferson Lab 12 GeV Upgrade will provide access to these fundamental underlying distributions and reveal new aspects of nucleon structure. It is quite possible that much of the remaining nucleon spin will be found in the orbital motion of the valence quarks.",

Unlike in atomic physics where electron excitation will eventually lead to ionization, the excited state spectrum of QCD continues to be expressed solely in terms of hadrons and never free quarks or gluons.

The same non-perturbative physics is believed to cause the dressing of these very light quarks into quasi-particle 'constituent' quarks with mass scale in the hundreds of MeV region. Such effective degrees-of-freedom were proposed long before QCD as a way to describe the systematics of the observed meson (and baryon) spectra. The experimental spin and parity distribution of states, and the lack of meson states with isospin or strangeness beyond one unit, suggests that mesons can be described simply in terms of a constituent quark and antiquark. The coupling of the spin-\u00bd quark and antiquark, allowing for orbital angular momentum between them, yields a clear prediction of the spin and parity quantum numbers of the meson states.",

But this surely is not the only role the gluonic field plays within the hadron spectrum. As a strongly coupled system the gluonic field should have its own excitation spectrum that should manifest itself as states beyond the constructions discussed above. Even in a theory without quarks, there would exist bound-states made purely of glue, the 'glueballs'. With quarks present, the glueball basis states can mix strongly with isoscalar states of the same and this has stymied attempts to extract clear information about glueballs from the experimental meson spectrum [2-2, 2-3].",

An explanation of this spectrum is provided by the lowest-energy gluonic excitation being of chromomagnetic character -heavier exotic states, are also observed, and appear to correspond to quark orbital excitation in addition to the same chromomagnetic gluonic excitation. (There are also strong suggestions that the same gluonic excitation plays the dominant role in determining the hybrid baryon spectrum [2-8]). The spectrum shown in (Figure 2.2) is obtained from a calculation where the light-quark masses are larger than their true physical values, but the qualitative features of the hybrid spectrum do not appear to change as the light quark mass is varied, as shown in the inset in Figure 2.2. Computations at lighter quark masses will be required to confidently estimate the mass scale, but it is clear from the trends observed that much, if not all, of this spectrum will be within the energy reach of the Jefferson Lab 12 GeV Upgrade in the GlueX experiment.",

Not only is this favored in a number of phenomenological calculations [2-9, 2-10, 2-11, 2-12], but lattice calculations that accurately reproduce the radiative decay of charmonium states also indicate that the radiative couplings of hybrid mesons are not small [2-13]. GlueX will use the coherent bremsstrahlung technique to produce a linearly-polarized real photon beam. A solenoid-based hermetic detector will collect data on meson resonance production through decays to charged and neutral final state particles. Statistics after the first full year of running will increase the current world photoproduction database from a few thousand events per final state to millions of events. This improvement by several orders of magnitude will provide a new window on mesons in the 1.8 to 2.7 GeV mass range.",

They offer a unique opportunity for a momentum tomography of the nucleon, complementary to the spatial tomography of GPDs.

They describe unpolarized quarks in a transversely polarized nucleon, and transversely polarized quarks in an unpolarized nucleon, respectively. The Sivers transverse-momentum distribution function has been recently used [3-5] to infer the GPD E in the collinear limit in order to estimate the angular momentum carried by quarks in the nucleon. The results of this study are shown in Figure 3.2; though they depend on a relation, inspired by spectator models, between the Sivers function and the GPD E, the consistency with constraints arising from DVCS measurements is encouraging. In SIDIS this function is also responsible for an effect known as \"color lensing\", which describes the overall color attraction between a struck quark on its way to becoming a hadron and the remnant system [3-9].

The Excited Baryon Analysis Center, established at Jefferson Lab, has developed the tools for performing a dynamical coupled-channel analysis and applied those techniques to world pion-and photoproduction data to provide unprecedented information on the spectrum of N* resonances. Recent lattice calculations suggest a spectrum of baryons at least as rich as that of the constituent quark model [3-63], and the presence of predominantly \"hybrid\" baryons with a gluonic excitation scale comparable to that expected for hybrid mesons [3-64] described in section 2a.

Due to its simple quark-antiquark valence structure, the pion lends itself as a benchmark for QCD calculations, and to revealing its underlying dynamics. In QCD, the mass of quarks is dynamically generated, and the quark's effective mass depends on its momentum. Changing the spatial resolution with which one probes the pion effectively probes this behavior. As a result, the measurement of the electromagnetic form factor of the pion is the best hope for gauging our understanding of the expected transition from the large-distance scales with confinement-dominated dynamics at modest Q 2 to the short-distance scales with perturbative-dominated dynamics at high Q 2 . This measurement is very timely given the experimental and theoretical controversy over the large Q 2 results for the \u03c0\u03b3*\u03b3 form factor [3-33, 3-39] that has refocused attention on the need to understand the distribution of momentum between the valence quark and antiquark. With the 12 GeV Upgrade, the pion form factor can be accurately mapped in Hall C up to momentum transfers of 6 GeV 2 [3-40], as illustrated in Flavor structure at large-x The ratio of the down to up quarks in a proton, d(x)/u(x), is a particularly sensitive measure of models of the nucleon, ranging from zero in models in which a scalar diquark dominates to one half in those with spin-flavor symmetry. Determining this ratio requires the measurement of both the neutron and the proton structure functions; obtaining the former is impeded by the lack of a free neutron target and the consequent need to disentangle the nuclear effects. The BoNuS experiment [3-34] at 6 GeV has demonstrated how the observation of the spectator proton in scattering from a deuterium target provides a powerful constraint on these nuclear corrections that will be exploited in the deep valence region at 12 GeV. A dedicated theoretical effort to quantify these effects has been established and the implications are ",

Deep inelastic scattering at high ( where m is the nucleon mass) corresponds to scattering from a single quark, where x B is a measure of the quark's momentum fraction.

The first evidence for nucleon structure modification was the EMC effect [4-3], in which deep-inelastic scattering from nuclear quarks is significantly different than from quarks inside a \"free\" nucleon (see Figure 4.1a). The per-nucleon DIS cross section ratio of nucleus A to deuterium decreases approximately linearly for 0.3 < x B < 0.7. The slope of this ratio in this region increases with A but does not scale simply with average nuclear density (see Figure 4.2). Despite a world-wide effort in experiment and theory, the origins of the EMC effect remain unclear. The 12 GeV experimental program will measure the EMC effect in a wide range of nuclei to help unravel the mystery [4-24, 4-25].",

However, when an electron strikes a quark in deep inelastic scattering, the quark can be knocked out from its parent nucleon. As the quark propagates, it will interact with the nucleus and pairs will tunnel out of the vacuum. Eventually, fully formed hadrons emerge. By changing the energy and momentum transferred to the struck quark we can vary the distance over which the quark forms hadrons (hadronizes). In addition, choosing different targets allows us to vary the nuclear distance that the propagating quark traverses. At 12 GeV we will measure how the production of hadrons varies with kinematics and nuclear sizes to learn how the color field of the hadron is restored [4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17].",

The propagating quark is expected to undergo multiple soft scatterings mediated by gluon emission.

This will be a clear way to differentiate quark/color interactions from purely hadronic interactions.",

Color transparency predicts that three quarks in a color singlet state, each of which (alone) would have interacted very strongly with nuclear matter, can form an object that passes undisturbed through the nucleus. A similar phenomenon occurs in QED, where a small-size pair has a small electric dipole moment and hence a small cross section. In QCD, a small-size or qqq system should have a small color dipole or tripole moment, and thus should have a small cross section due to cancelation of the color fields of the quarks. While color transparency is somewhat analogous to the QED example, color transparency in the qqq case would be one of the rare demonstrations of the SU(3) nature of the underlying color degrees of freedom. However, we do expect to observe color transparency at lower momentum transfers than qqq color transparency, since it is easier to produce a small-size two-quark system than a three-quark system. ",

In contrast, our knowledge of neutron densities is much less precise because it comes primarily from hadron scattering experiments involving the non-perturbative strong interaction. However, the weak charge of the neutron is much larger than that of the proton. This means that the measurement of the parity violating asymmetry, A PV , in elastic scattering of polarized electrons provides a model-independent probe of neutron densities, free from most strong interaction uncertainties. The first measurement using a 208 Pb target was recently carried out in Hall A [4-16]. The measurement corresponds to a difference between the radii of the neutron and proton distributions of about 0.3 fm (see Figure 4.5). This is the first electroweak observation of the neutron skin in a heavy, neutron-rich nucleus.  ",

With the resulting ability to achieve part per billion precision and sub-1% normalization accuracy on A PV measurements, it has now become possible to probe for extensions of the Standard Model of electroweak interactions, which may for example involve the interactions of new massive (M > M Z ) bosons that couple to electrons and/or quarks, or other similar process [5-1].",

The most promising method for accurate determinations of the axial-quark couplings is to carry out more precise measurements of the same quantity. The use of a deuterium target minimizes the uncertainties due to quark distribution functions and the measurement is sensitive to the couplings (2C 1u \u2212 C 1d ) and (2C 2u \u2212C 2d ), where the relative weight depends on the details of the kinematics, but is different from the combination accessed by the Qweak experiment. At the level of precision envisioned, small corrections to A PV also arise from strange quark distribution functions, possible charge symmetry violation, and higher twist effects. The optimum strategy would achieve simultaneous A PV measurements in narrow (x B , Q 2 ) bins to provide precision measurements of the C iq combinations, while simultaneously providing new insights into nucleon structure in the valence region. Figure 5.3 shows the projected improvements in the determination of C iq 's; this is particularly remarkable for the axial-vector quark couplings. The proposed SoLID [5-8] project will improve the determination of (2C 2u \u2212C 2d ) by a factor of 6 to 8 over the 6 GeV initial measurement. The Jefferson Lab program will thus improve the current world data by more than a factor of 30. Quite apart from unambiguously establishing a non-zero value for a C 2q combination for the first time, the measurement has complementary sensitivity to new TeV-scale physics. One example [5-11] is due to the sensitivity via radiative corrections to the so-called leptophobic Z\u02b9.

These experiments include the A\u02b9 Experiment (APEX), the Heavy Photon Search (HPS), and Detecting A Resonance Kinematically with Electrons Incident on a Gaseous Hydrogen Target (Dark Light). We briefly review the theory and motivation for heavy photons, before discussing the rich experimental program planned at Jefferson Lab to search for them.",

This A\u02b9 mass range is particularly intriguing. An A\u02b9 could explain the discrepancy between the measured and calculated value of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon . This long-standing discrepancy provides a particularly compelling experimental \"target\" shown with a green band in Figure 5.6. It could also explain some of the data of cosmic-ray, balloon-borne, or terrestrial dark matter experiments . Dark matter, which consists of some unknown particle(s) and makes up 80% of the matter density in our Universe, could be part of a hidden sector and couple to an A\u02b9. This would produce new dark matter interactions with ordinary matter and might explain some of the observed data \"anomalies\". For example, a rise in the observed number of cosmic-ray positrons  at energies of ~ 10 GeV and higher, above what is naively expected from astrophysical background sources suggests a contribution from dark ",

Hall A will also be used for special setup experiments, such as the M\u00f8ller experiment and the SoLID experiment. The upgraded Hall B spectrometer will be suited in particular for understanding nuclear structure via generalized parton distributions and for studying propagation of quarks in (cold) nuclear matter. These measurements require detection of several final state particles and good missing-mass resolution or observation of exclusive final states, accomplished by the very large acceptance of the Hall B multi-particle spectrometer which spans laboratory polar angles from 5 to 140 degrees. In Hall C the coincidence magnetic spectrometer setup supports high-luminosity experiments detecting reaction products with momenta up to the full beam energy, a virtue well matched for making precision determinations of the valence quarks in nucleons and nuclei. The new Hall D and its dedicated spectrometer are designed to search for QCD-predicted hybrid mesons using photoproduction via linearly polarized photons, which in turn enables a partial wave analysis of any new observed states to determine whether they have allowed or exotic quantum numbers.

The central field is uniform to 10 -4 in order to operate with a polarized target. The target is surrounded by a four-layer silicon-strip vertex tracker (SVT) arranged in a barrel configuration. Outside the SVT is a 48-element central TOF array, read out from both ends by photomultiplier tubes mounted on long light guides. Radial space and some downstream axial space in the solenoid bore is reserved for foreseen upgrades involving neutron detection and in particular additional tracking to identify detached vertices from hyperon decays. The space between the solenoid and the torus is occupied by a new Cerenkov detector. Particles passing to the forward spectrometer must traverse the thin mirror of this high-threshold Cerenkov counter (HTCC), with the entire HTCC contained in a thin-walled vessel operating at atmospheric pressure. A heavy tungsten M\u00f8ller shield, which is supported from the torus, in combination with the 5T solenoid field prevents M\u00f8ller electrons from overwhelming the spectrometer.",

This pair of heavily shielded magnetic spectrometers allows for high-precision measurements of neutrino-like cross sections to map valence quarks in nucleons and nuclei. The optical configuration of both magnetic spectrometers is similar, being QQQD for the HMS and being supplemented by a horizontal bender to reach angles as small as 5.5 degrees for SHMS, resulting in DQQQD. The main Dipole bends vertically and transports accepted particles to a detector package in a heavily-shielded area on the spectrometer platform. The shield includes inner linings of lead and boron-carbide to suppress neutrons and gamma rays, all encased in heavy concrete walls. The boron carbide is included as a 'sand' in a pourable concrete form developed and patented at Jefferson Lab. All five magnets are superconducting, bath-cooled by liquid helium, and with custom designs. An overall layout for the SHMS is shown in Figure 6.6. The foreseen detector package for SHMS mimics that of HMS. Upon exit from the main dipole magnet particles traverse a noble-gas Cerenkov counter filled with Ar or Ne, then pass through a set of x-y drift chambers, then transit the first of two x-y scintillator hodoscopes used for rough trajectory determination plus triggering. They next pass through a heavy gas Cerenkov counter, filled with C 4 F 8 O, then transit a second pair of x-y trigger hodoscopes, and finally end in an electromagnetic calorimeter including a pre-shower and shower section, both of lead glass blocks. The downstream 'Y' hodoscope plane is made of cast quartz. In between the downstream hodoscope pair and the pre-shower detector a space is reserved for specific detectors, most notably a pair of aerogel-based Cerenkov counters for kaon identification. The entire detector package sits on an optical bench to align it with the magnetic optical axis of the dipole. The hodoscopes, Cerenkov counters, and calorimeters are read out by PMTs, while the drift chambers are read out by a standard electronics chain including amplifier, discriminator and TDC. The readout uses the pipelined ADCs developed for Hall D. Space is reserved in the detector 'stack' for future detectors, notably an aerogel-based Cerenkov counter. It is possible to remove some of the detectors and insert a proton polarimeter, for instance, as experiment needs dictate.",

A cylindrical tracking chamber is placed around the target and works in tandem with planar tracking chambers placed downstream. Both sets of chambers are enclosed by an annular Barrel electromagnetic Calorimeter, comprised of thin lead sheets interleaved with axial scintillating fibers.

MOLLER will benefit from the steady improvement in the techniques employed to measure parity-violating asymmetries to sub-ppb systematic precision and to achieve normalization control at the sub-% level. Two redundant continuous monitors of electron beam polarization would be employed to achieve normalization control at 0.4%. Auxiliary detectors would track individual particles at low rates to measure the absolute value of Q 2 to 0.5%. Very forward angle detectors downstream of the main detectors would monitor potentially fatal luminosity fluctuations due to jitter in electron beam properties and target density.

Valence quarks are the irreducible kernel of each hadron, responsible for its charge, baryon number and other macroscopic quantum numbers.While deep inelastic scattering and other experiments have provided a detailed map of the nucleon's quark distributions at x < 0:5, there has there never been an experimental facility capable of accurately measuring the cross sections throughout the \"deep valence region\" (x > 0.5), where the three basic valence quarks of the proton and neutron predominate. Thus the large-x region provides an ideal theater in which to explore the dynamics of the quarks in a nucleon. Moreover, an accurate knowledge of the distributions in the deep valence region has an important impact on hadronic cross sections at the small values of x and large values of Q 2 relevant for the LHC, and can affect searches for new physics beyond the Standard Model [3-47, 3-48].",
