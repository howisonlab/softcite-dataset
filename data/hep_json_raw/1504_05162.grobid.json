This article presents the results of a search for events containing at least one long-lived particle that decays at a significant distance from its production point into two leptons or into five or more charged particles. This analysis uses a data sample of proton-proton collisions at ffiffi ffi s p \u00bc 8 TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb \u22121 collected in 2012 by the ATLAS detector operating at the Large Hadron Collider. No events are observed in any of the signal regions, and limits are set on model parameters within supersymmetric scenarios involving R-parity violation, split supersymmetry, and gauge mediation. In some of the search channels, the trigger and search strategy are based only on the decay products of individual long-lived particles, irrespective of the rest of the event. In these cases, the provided limits can easily be reinterpreted in different scenarios.",

            "text": "Several extensions to the Standard Model (SM) predict the production at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) of heavy particles with lifetimes of order picoseconds to nanoseconds (e.g., see Ref. [1] and references therein). At the LHC experiments, the decay of a long-lived particle (LLP) with lifetime in this range could be observed as a displaced vertex (DV), with daughter particles produced at a significant distance from the interaction point (IP) of the incoming proton beams. Particle decays may be suppressed by small couplings or high mass scales, thus resulting in long lifetimes. An example of a small-coupling scenario is supersymmetry with R-parity violation (RPV) [2,3]. The present (largely indirect) constraints on RPV couplings allow the decay of the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) as it traverses a particle detector at the LHC. In general gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking (GGM) scenarios [4], the next-to-lightest supersymmetric particle (NLSP) decays into an SM particle and the LSP, which is a very light gravitino. The NLSP width is suppressed by the large supersymmetry-breaking scale, and may be such that its decay leads to the formation of a DV. Within split supersymmetry [5,6], gluino (g) decay is suppressed by the high mass of the squarks. Long-lived gluinos then hadronize into heavy \"R-hadrons\" that may decay at a detectable distance from their production point. Additional scenarios with LLPs include hidden-valley [7], dark-sector gauge bosons [8], and stealth supersymmetry [9]. Some of the models are disfavored [10] by the recent observation of a Higgs boson at m H \u2248 125 GeV [11,12].",

Two types of signatures are considered. In the dilepton signature, the vertex is formed from at least two lepton candidates (with \"lepton\" referring to an electron or a muon), with opposite electric charges. In the multitrack signature, the DV must contain at least five charged-particle tracks. This signature is divided into four different final states, in which the DV must be accompanied by a hightransverse-momentum (high-p T ) muon or electron candidate that originates from the DV, jets, or missing transverse momentum (E miss T ). These signatures are labeled DV \u00fe muon, DV \u00fe electron, DV \u00fe jets, and DV \u00fe E miss T , respectively. In all signatures, at least one DV is required per event. In all cases, the expected background is much less than one event.",

At small radii, silicon pixel layers and stereo pairs of silicon microstrip detectors provide highresolution position measurements. The pixel system consists of three barrel layers, and three forward disks on either side of the IP. The barrel pixel layers, which are positioned at radii of 50.5 mm, 88.5 mm, and 122.5 mm, are of particular relevance to this work. The silicon microstrip tracker (SCT) comprises four double layers in the barrel and nine forward disks on either side. The radial position of the innermost (outermost) SCT barrel layer is 30.3 cm (52.0 cm). A further tracking system, a transition-radiation tracker (TRT), is positioned at larger radii, with coverage up to j\u03b7j \u00bc 2.0. This device has two hit thresholds, the higher of which is used to assist in the identification of electrons through the production of transition radiation within the TRT.",

After the application of detector and data-quality requirements, the integrated luminosity of the data sample is 20.3 fb \u22121 . The uncertainty on the integrated luminosity is AE2.8%. It is derived following the same methodology as that detailed in Ref. [32]. With respect to the origin of the ATLAS coordinate system at the center of the detector, the mean position of the pp collision, averaged throughout the collected data sample, is hxi \u00bc \u22120.3 mm, hyi \u00bc 0.7 mm, hzi \u00bc \u22127.7 mm. The root-mean-square spread of the z distribution of the collisions is \u03c3 z \u00bc 47.7 mm, and the spreads in the x and y directions are less than 0.1 mm. Samples of simulated Monte Carlo (MC) events are used to study the reconstruction and trigger efficiency for signal events within RPV, split supersymmetry, and GGM scenarios. In each simulated event, two gluinos or two squarks are created in the pp collision. Both of these primary particles undergo decay chains described by the same set of effective operators. In the simulated GGM and RPV scenarios, the LLP is the lightest neutralino\u03c7 0 1 . In the split-supersymmetry scenario, the LLP is the gluino. Diagrams representing the simulated processes are shown in Fig. 1.",

This is referred to as the accidental-crossing background. (ii) A much smaller background contribution is due to merged vertices. In this case, two low-m DV vertices are less than 1 mm apart, and thus may be combined by the vertex-reconstruction algorithm into a single vertex that satisfies the N tr and m DV criteria. The expected background levels from the two sources are estimated from the data. In order for the background estimate to have high statistical precision, it is performed with a large sample containing all events that have undergone retracking. This includes the events selected for this search, as described in Sec. IV C, as well as events used for other ATLAS analyses. The sample is divided into three subsamples, referred to as the muon stream, the electron stream, and the jets \u00fe E miss T stream, with the name  indicating the type of trigger used to select the events. The background level is estimated separately in each of these streams with the methods described below, and the results are used for the DV \u00fe muon, DV \u00fe electron, and DV \u00fe jets and DV \u00fe E miss T signal regions, respectively. To obtain the final background estimate in the signal region, the background estimate in each stream is multiplied by a final-selection scale factor F stream , which is the fraction of events in the given stream that satisfy the final event-selection criteria, other than the DV selection criteria. The values of these fractions are 0.08%, 5.0%, 1.45%, and 0.04%, for the DV \u00fe muon, DV \u00fe electron, DV \u00fe jet, and DV \u00fe E miss T searches, respectively. This use of F stream assumes that the average number of vertices per event, N DV ev , is independent of the selection criteria. Based on the change in N DV ev when the final selection criteria are applied, an upward bias correction of 60% is applied to the estimated background level in the DV \u00fe electron channel (the correction is included in the F stream \u00bc 5.0% value quoted above).

It is observed that the method correctly predicts the accidental-crossing background to within about 10%. The background-estimation method is tested also on pairs of tracks in the data, excluding pairs of lepton candidates, with a variety of selection criteria. The predicted and observed numbers of background vertices are again found to agree to within 10% for all selection criteria. The method also reproduces well the distributions of m DV , r DV , z DV ,d \u2022p, and the azimuthal angle between the two lepton candidates, in both MC simulation and data. As an example, Fig. 8 shows the m DV and r DV distributions observed for data vertices composed of two nonlepton tracks and the distributions predicted by pairing two tracks in different events. Some differences between the model and the data are seen at certain radii (e.g., r DV < 50 mm and 250 < r DV < 270 mm), but these do not substantially affect the total number of DVs and are covered by the assigned systematic uncertainty (see Sec.
