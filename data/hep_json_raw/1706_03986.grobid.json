Requirements on additional leptons, jets, jets identified as originating from b-quarks, and missing transverse momentum are imposed to target the other decay products of the top squark pair. The analysis is performed using proton-proton collision data at \u221a s = 13 TeV collected with the ATLAS detector at the LHC in 2015-2016, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb \u22121 . No excess is observed in the data with respect to the SM predictions. The results are interpreted in two sets of models. In the first set, direct production of pairs of lighter top squarks (t 1 ) with long decay chains involving Z or Higgs bosons is considered. The second set includes direct pair production of the heavier top squark pairs (t 2 ) decaying viat 2 \u2192 Zt 1 ort 2 \u2192 ht 1 . The results exclude at 95% confidence levelt 2 andt 1 masses up to about 800 GeV, extending the exclusion region of supersymmetric parameter space covered by previous LHC searches.",

            "text": "Supersymmetry (SUSY) [1][2][3][4][5][6] is one of the most studied extensions of the Standard Model (SM). It predicts new bosonic partners for the existing fermions and fermionic partners for the known bosons. If R-parity is conserved [7], SUSY particles are produced in pairs and the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) is stable, providing a possible dark-matter candidate. The SUSY partners of the charged (neutral) Higgs bosons and electroweak gauge bosons mix to form the mass eigenstates known as charginos (\u03c7 \u00b1 k , k = 1, 2) and neutralinos (\u03c7 0 m , m = 1, . . . , 4), where the increasing index denotes increasing mass. The scalar partners of right-handed and left-handed quarks,q R andq L , mix to form two mass eigenstates, q 1 andq 2 , withq 1 defined to be the lighter of the two. To address the SM hierarchy problem [8][9][10][11], TeV-scale masses are required [12,13] for the supersymmetric partners of the gluons (gluinos,g) and the top squarks [14,15]. Furthermore, the higgsino is required not to be heavier than a few hundred GeV.",

Although the pair production oft 1 has a cross-section larger than that of th\u1ebd t 2 , and their decay properties can be similar, searches for the latter can provide additional sensitivity in regions where thet 1 falls in a phase space difficult to experimentally discriminate from the background due to the similarities in kinematics with tt pair production, such as scenarios where the lighter top squark is only slightly heavier than the sum of the masses of the top quark and the lightest neutralino (\u03c7 0 1 ).",

Cross-sections calculated at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) including resummation of next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic (NNLL) soft-gluon terms are used for top quark production processes. For production of top quark pairs in association with vector and Higgs bosons, cross-sections calculated at next-to-leading order (NLO) are used, and the event generator cross-sections from Sherpa (at NLO for most of the processes) are used when normalising the multi-boson backgrounds. In all MC samples, except those produced by Sherpa, the EvtGen v1.2.0 program [38] is used to model the properties of the bottom and charm hadron decays.",

The normalisation of the main backgrounds (ttZ, multi-boson) is obtained by fitting the yield to the observed data in two control regions, then extrapolating this yield to the SRs as described above.

Two types of lepton identification criteria are defined for this evaluation: \"tight\" and \"loose\", corresponding to the signal and candidate electrons and muons described in Section 4. The leading lepton is considered to be prompt, which is a valid assumption in more than 95% of the cases according to simulations. The method makes use of the number of observed events with the second and third leading leptons being loose-loose, loose-tight, tight-loose and tight-tight in each region. The probability for prompt leptons satisfying the loose selection criteria to also satisfy the tight selection is measured using a data sample enriched in Z \u2192 + \u2212 ( = e, \u00b5) decays. The equivalent probability for fake or non-prompt leptons is measured using events with one electron and one muon with the same charge. The number of events with one or two fake or non-prompt leptons is calculated from these probabilities and the number of observed events with loose and tight leptons. The modelling of the background from fake or non-prompt leptons is validated in events passing a selection similar to the SRs, but removing the E miss T requirements and inverting the m requirements.",

For each signal hypothesis, the background fit is redone taking into account the signal contamination in the CRs, which is found to be below 15% for signal models close to the Run-1 exclusion limits. All uncertainties in the SM prediction are considered, including those that are correlated between signal and background (for instance, jet energy scale uncertainties), as well as all uncertainties in the predicted signal, excluding PDF-and scale-induced uncertainties in the theoretical cross-section. Since the three SRs are not orthogonal, only the SR with best expected sensitivity is used for each signal point. \"Observed limits\" are calculated from the observed event yields in the SRs. \"Expected limits\" are calculated by setting the nominal event yield in each SR to the corresponding mean expected background.  Table 9: Observed and expected numbers of events in the six signal regions. The nominal predictions from MC simulation are given for comparison for those backgrounds (ttZ, multi-boson for the 3 1b selection and tt for the 1 4b selection) that are normalised to data in dedicated control regions. For SR 3 1b A , SR 3 1b B and SR 3 1b C , the \"Others\" category contains the contributions from tth, ttWW, ttt, tttt, Wh, and Zh production. For SR 1 4b A , SR 1 4b B and SR 1 4b C , the \"Others\" category contains the contributions from ttWW, ttt, tttt, tZ, and tWZ production. Combined statistical and systematic uncertainties are given. Signal model-independent 95% CL upper limits on the visible BSM cross-section (\u03c3 vis ), the visible number of signal events (S 95 obs ), the number of signal events (S 95 exp ) given the expected number of background events (and \u00b11\u03c3 variations of the expected background), and the discovery p-value (p(s = 0)), all calculated with pseudo-experiments, are also shown for each signal region.

Good agreement is found between the yield of observed events and the SM predictions. Modelindependent limits are presented, which allow the results to be reinterpreted in generic models that also predict similar final states in association with invisible particles.

They are determined using a combination of simulated and data samples, through measurements of the jet response asymmetry in dijet, Z+jet and \u03b3+jet events[91]. Uncertainties associated with the modelling of the b-tagging efficiencies for b-jets, c-jets and light-flavour jets [92, 93] are also considered. The systematic uncertainties related to the modelling of E miss T in the simulation are estimated by propagating the uncertainties in the energy and momentum scale of all identified electrons, photons, muons and jets, as well as the uncertainties in the soft-term scale and resolution [85]. Other detector-related systematic uncertainties, such as those in the lepton reconstruction efficiency, energy scale and energy resolution, and in the modelling of the trigger [76], are found to have a small impact on the results. The uncertainties in the modelling of the tt and single-top backgrounds in simulation in the 1 4b selection are estimated by varying the renormalisation and factorisation scales, as well as the amount of initial-and final-state radiation used to generate the samples [34]. Additional uncertainties in the parton-shower modelling are assessed as the difference between the predictions from Powheg showered with Pythia and Herwig, and due to the event generator choice by comparing Powheg and MadGraph5_aMC@NLO [34], in both cases showered with Pythia. The diboson background MC modelling uncertainties are estimated by varying the renormalisation, factorisation and resummation scales used to generate the samples [94]. For ttZ, the predictions from the MadGraph5_aMC@NLO and Sherpa event generators are compared, and the uncertainties related to the choice of renormalisation and factorisation scales are assessed by varying the corresponding event generator parameters up and down by a factor of two around their nominal values [95].",
