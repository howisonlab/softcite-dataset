            "text": "The identity of the nucleon comes from the valence quarks, 2 up and a down for a proton, 2 down and an up for neutron. But high energy scattering processes such as deep inelastic scattering (DIS) and hadronic reactions, e.g. Drell-Yan (DY) and jet production, reveal that, in addition, there is a sea of quarks, anti-quarks and gluons residing in the nucleon. Moreover the distributions of these change with the scale or momentum transfer of the scattering. Much of this conference is devoted to reports on understanding how the spin of the nucleon is assembled from the intrinsic spin and orbital motion of these partons. One important aspect of this quest is separating how the various flavors of the quarks and anti-quarks differ in their contributions and exploring whether something more might be learned beyond the distributions themselves.",

            "text": "Simplified pictures of the origin of anti-quarks in the nucleon give dramatically different expectations for the ratios of\u016b tod quarks in a proton. In perturbative QCD they arise in quark/anti-quark pair creation and, since the\u016b andd masses are small, one would expect roughly equal numbers. On the other hand, if one considers the long range nuclear force mediated by pions, the proton has a component that is made of a neutron and a \u03c0 + resulting in an expected excess ofd quarks. (For a general overview see Ref. [1].) The E886 DY experiment by the NuSea collaboration has generated significant interest by demonstrating clear asymmetries in the momentum fraction (x) dependent distributions of\u016b andd [2]. Corrections to pQCD models for generating the sea accounting for Pauli blocking effects have not been able to explain the data. A number of models, some related to quark bag models, and some chiral symmetry motivated are consistent with the unpolarized data. However they tend to make different predictions for the helicity dependence of the flavor asymmetry, with chiral quark soliton models predicting larger asymmetries for the polarized distributions than the bag models [3].",

The production mechanism is primarily through the channel where a u quark combines with ad anti-quark to produce a W + and likewise a d with a\u016b to produce a W \u2212 . In addition, the V-A coupling of the weak interaction allows only left-handed quarks to combine with right-handed anti-quarks providing a maximal parity violating signal and thus the necessary spin determination. Finally, the handedness of the neutrinos in the W decay results in a partial transfer of the initial state kinematics, q andq relative momentum fractions, into the final state decay products. The required measurements consist of determining A L , the change in cross section with a single beam spin helicity flip, for W + and W \u2212 for flip of each beam independently. The two W + measurements provide sensitivity to two linear combinations of \u2206u(x) and \u2206d(x) and the two W \u2212 measurements to \u2206d(x) and \u2206\u016b(x).

The STAR detector [7] covers a full 2\u03c0 in azimuth and is embedded in a solenoidal magnet with field strength of 0.5 T. A major portion of the internal volume is occupied by a large time projection chamber (TPC) to track charged particles over a radius from 0.6m to 1.9m. The existing tracking should be sufficient for pseudo-rapidity (scattering angle) | \u03b7 |< 1 (\u03b8 > 37 \u2022 ).

The calorimeters each have longitudinal segmentation to help in providing background rejection as will be discussed below. These include separate read out of the first few layers of the calorimeters to provide a preshower signal and fine position resolution shower maximum detectors to measure the transverse shower profile. In addition, the endcap calorimeter has a separately read out final layer to provide a post-shower signal.",

The primary backgrounds are QCD jets which happen to have a particle that deposits a similarly high p T in an electromagnetic calorimeter. The STAR detector is not sufficiently hermetic to reconstruct the neutrino with missing transverse energy. Thus we employ three classes of cuts to reject background while preserving the signal. The first is isolation around the electron candidate. Tracks and hits in the calorimeter within r<0.45 in \u03b7-\u03c6 space are used to reject backgrounds based on the accompanying jet particles. The second class rejects events with tracks and calorimeter energy opposite in \u03c6 from the candidate, as most jets will have its partner of the dijet within the acceptance. Finally details of the candidate interaction in the detector are used, such as the transverse profile at the shower maximum detector and energy in the pre-and post-shower detectors. The calorimeters are only one hadronic interaction length long so most hadrons do not deposit a large fraction of their energy in the calorimeter. Mesons, such as \u03c0 0 s, which decay electromagnetically need to be rejected by a lack of hits in the tracking system. Up to 30% conversions are allowed while still giving the background rejection considered here and sets a requirement on material in front of the tracking system. Together these cuts reduce the original background by up to a factor of 1000 while preserving over 80% of the signal and we find that for p T >28 GeV/c the signal to background is better than 1:1.",
