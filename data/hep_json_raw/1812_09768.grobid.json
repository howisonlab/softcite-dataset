The data sample was collected in 2016 and corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 . Final states studied for TT production include those where one of the T quarks decays via T \u2192 tZ and the other via T \u2192 bW, tZ, or tH, where H is a Higgs boson. For the BB case, final states include those where one of the B quarks decays via B \u2192 bZ and the other B \u2192 tW, bZ, or bH. Events with two oppositely charged electrons or muons, consistent with coming from the decay of a Z boson, and jets are investigated. The number of observed events is consistent with standard model background estimations. Lower limits at 95% confidence level are placed on the masses of the T and B quarks for a range of branching fractions. Assuming 100% branching fractions for T \u2192 tZ, and B \u2192 bZ, T and B quark mass values below 1280 and 1130 GeV, respectively, are excluded.",

            "text": "The standard model (SM) has been outstandingly successful in describing a wide range of fundamental phenomena. However, one of its notable shortcomings is that it does not provide a natural explanation for the Higgs boson (H) [1][2][3] observed at 125 GeV [4,5] having a mass that is comparable to the electroweak scale. The suppression of divergent loop corrections to the Higgs boson mass requires either fine-tuning of the SM parameters or new particles at the TeV scale. Many theories of beyond-the-SM physics phenomena that attempt to solve this hierarchy problem predict new particles, which could be partners of the top and bottom quarks and thus cancel the leading loop corrections. Vector-like quarks (VLQs) represent one class of such particles among those that have fermionic properties. Their left-and right-handed components transform in the same way under the SM symmetry e-mail: cms-publication-committee-chair@cern.ch group SU(3) C \u00d7SU(2) L \u00d7U(1) Y [6]. This property allows them to have a gauge-invariant mass term in the Lagrangian of the form \u03c8\u03c8, where \u03c8 represents the fermion field; hence, their masses are not determined by their Yukawa couplings to the Higgs boson. These quarks are not ruled out by the measured properties of the Higgs boson. They are predicted in many beyond-the-SM scenarios such as grand unified theories [7], beautiful mirrors [8], models with extra dimensions [9], little Higgs [10][11][12], and composite Higgs models [13], as well as theories proposed to explain the SM flavor structure [14] and solve the strong CP problem [15].",

Another characteristic of the VLQs is their flavor-changing neutral current decay, which distinguishes them from chiral fermions.

The strictest lower limits on the T and B quark masses range between 790 and 1350 GeV, depending on the decay mode studied. The mass range for the T and B quarks studied in this analysis is 800-1500 GeV. The central feature of the CMS apparatus is a superconducting solenoid of 6 m internal diameter, providing a magnetic field of 3.8 T. Within the solenoid volume are a silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL), and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter (HCAL), each composed of a barrel and two endcap sections. Forward calorimeters extend the pseudorapidity (\u03b7) coverage provided by the barrel and endcap detectors. Muons are detected in gas-ionization chambers embedded in the steel flux-return yoke outside the solenoid. A more detailed description of the CMS detector, together with a definition of the coordinate system used and the relevant kinematic variables, can be found in Ref. [24].",

Throughout the paper this background will be referred to as DY+jets. Other backgrounds, such as diboson, tZq, tWZ, and ttW production, are considerably smaller. The DY+jets simulated background samples are generated in different bins of the Z boson transverse momentum p T , using the mc@nlo [32] event generator at NLO precision with the FxFx jet-matching scheme [33]. The tt+jets events are generated using the powheg 2.0 [34][35][36] generator. The generated events are interfaced with pythia 8.212 [28] for shower modeling and hadronization, using the underlying event tune CUETP8M2T4 [37] for tt+jets simulation and CUETP8M1 [29] for the DY+jets process. The SM diboson events are also produced using the same standalone pythia 8.212 generator. The production of rare single top processes tZq and tWZ, as well as a tt pair in association with a Wor Z boson, are simulated with up to one additional parton in the matrix element calculations using the Mad-Graph5_amc@nlo 2.3.3 [26] generator at LO precision and matched with the parton showering predictions using the MLM matching scheme [38].",

The energy of charged hadrons is determined from a combination of their momentum measured in the tracker and the matching ECAL and HCAL energy deposits, corrected for zero-suppression effects and for the response function of the calorimeters to hadronic showers. Finally, the energy of neutral hadrons is obtained from the corresponding corrected ECAL and HCAL energies. To suppress the contribution from pileup, charged particles not originating from the primary vertex are removed from the jet clustering. An event-by-event jet-area-based correction [52,53] is applied to subtract the contribution of the neutral-particle component of the pileup. Residual corrections are applied to the data to account for the differences with the simulations [54].",

In order to account for the difference in the jet shower profile of V \u2192 qq and H \u2192 bb decays, a correction factor to the H jets mass scale and resolution [64] is measured by comparing the ratio of H and V jet efficiencies using the pythia 8.212 [28] and herwig++ [65] shower generators.

All these corrections are propagated to V, top quark and H jets, respectively. For top quark jets, the corrections to the \u03c4 32 selection efficiency are measured between data and simulation [63] using softdrop groomed jets. To account for the misidentification of boosted V-, H-, and t-tagged jets in the background samples, mistagging scale factors are derived from a region in the data enriched in Z+jets events, which is constructed using the selection criteria listed in Table 1, with the exception that events must have zero b jets.

The fraction of the signal identified by the jet substructure and resolved taggers depends on the T quark mass. For masses below 1200 GeV, the two taggers are equally efficient in identifying signal events for all the channels. For T quark masses above 1200 GeV, the jet substructure tagger becomes more efficient.

Scale factors listed in Table 4 are determined using the CR0b control region, which is enriched with Z+jets events. After applying these corrections, the distributions of kinematic variables in the control regions from the background simulations are in agreement with the data, as shown for example in Fig. 2 for the S T distributions. Table 3 The first four columns show different event categories used for the BB search, classified according to the number of AK4 b-tagged jets N b and the number of V \u2192 qq, H \u2192 bb, and t \u2192 qq b candidates in the event, N V , N H , and N t , respectively, identified using the jet substructure algorithm. The last three columns show the relative signal acceptance for a B quark of mass 1200 GeV for decay channels bZbZ, bZbH and bZtW as described in text  The effect on the signal and background acceptance uncertainties due to the renormalization and factorization scale (\u03bc f and \u03bc r ) uncertainties and the PDF choices in the simulations are taken into account in the statistical analysis. The influence of \u03bc f and \u03bc r scale uncertainties are estimated by varying the default scales by the following six combinations of factors, (\u03bc f , \u03bc r ) \u00d7 (1/2, 1/2), (1/2, 1), (1, 1/2), (2, 2), (2, 1), and (1, 2). The maximum and minimum of the six variations are computed for each bin of the S T distribution, producing an uncertainty \"envelope\". The uncertainties due to the PDF choices in the simulations are estimated using the PDF4LHC procedure [27,[70][71][72], where the root-meansquare of 100 pseudo-experiments provided by the PDF sets represents the uncertainty envelope. The background and signal event counts are then varied relative to their nominal values up and down by a factor of two times the uncertainty envelopes. The impacts of these variations on the background and signal shape are also taken into account. The effect of the \u03bc f and \u03bc r scale uncertainties on the TT and BB signal yield is < 1%. However, this has the largest effect, amounting to as much as 36% on the background yield. The effect due to PDF choices amounts to a 3.2-9.5% change in the signal and background yields. The effect of the uncertainty in the pileup determination is estimated by varying the nominal pp inelastic cross section by 4.6% [42], which has an impact of 1.5-3.6% on the signal yields. Differences between simulation and data in the jet multiplicity distributions in DY+jets background events, derived in the CR0b region as shown in Table 4, are taken as an estimate of the associated systematic uncertainty, which ranges from 4.0-11.5%",

All uncertainties affect the normalizations of the S T distributions. The tick mark indicates the uncertainties that also affect the shape, and the uncertainty range accounts for their effects on the expected yields across all the TT groups or BB categories.

The systematic uncertainties due to the jet shower profile differences between the jets in the W \u2192 qq and H \u2192 bb processes are estimated from the difference observed between results obtained with the pythia 8 and herwig++ generators and are applied to the V-and H-tagged jets.

The uncertainties in the misidentification rates of boosted jets are 5, 14, and 7% for the W-, H-, and t-tagged jets, respectively. They are used to derive the uncertainties in the estimates of the numbers of mistagged jets in the signal and background simulated events, which result in uncertainties in the BB signal yields of up to 14%. The uncertainties in the b tagging efficiency scale factors are propagated to the final result, with the uncertainties in the b-and c-flavored quark jets treated as fully correlated. These uncertainties are in the range 2-5% for b-flavored jets, a factor of two larger for c-flavored jets, and \u224810% for light-flavored jets. The uncertainties due to heavy-and light-flavored jets are considered uncorrelated. Table 5 summarizes the systematic uncertainties in the background and signal yields in the TT and BB searches.

The BB search looks for events in which one B quark decays via B \u2192 bZ and the other via B \u2192 tW, bZ, or bH. Events with two oppositely charged electrons or muons, consistent with coming from the decay of a Z boson, and jets are investigated, and are categorized according to the numbers of top quark and W, Z, and Higgs boson candidates.

Upper limits at 95% confidence level on the TT and BB production cross sections are obtained from a simultaneous binned maximumlikelihood fit to the observed distributions for the different event categories, under the assumption of various T and B quark branching fractions. Comparing these upper limits to the theoretical predictions for the TT and BB cross sections as a function of the T and B quark masses, lower limits on the masses at 95% confidence level are determined for different branching fraction scenarios. In the case of a T quark decaying exclusively via T \u2192 tZ, the lower mass limit is 1280 GeV, while for a B quark decaying only via B \u2192 bZ, it is 1130 GeV. These lower limits are comparable with those measured by the ATLAS Collaboration [20], also using the Table 8 The numbers of observed events and the predicted number of SM background events in the BB search for the five event categories using Z \u2192 e + e \u2212 channel.
