The current situation is expected to be significantly improved by a new experiment with polarized beams at the NICA accelerator complex. The proton-proton and proton-nucleon collisions will be collected by the Spin Physics Detector (SPD) [1]. The CMS energy for proton-proton collisions at NICA varies from 10 GeV to 27 GeV.",

            "text": "There are several physical tools to probe the internal structure of the nucleon: the Drell-Yan process, prompt photons, charmonia production, and inclusive hadron production. Here the physics with charmonia is considered. On the parton level, the J/\u03c8 production is expected to be dominated by gluon-gluon fusion but the contribution of quark-antiquark annihilation may be significant in some kinematic regions. This makes inclusive charmonia production complementary to prompt photons and Drell-Yan studies. From the experimental point of view, the simplest charmonia state to study is J/\u03c8 due to a large production cross-section and a clean experimental signature in the dimuon decay mode. It has the same observables as the Drell-Yan process. For the unpolarized case, they are the total cross-section, the J/\u03c8 p T and x F spectra and polarization. For polarized hadron collisions, the transverse structure of hadrons can be probed by measuring spin asymmetries of the J/\u03c8 production or studying the cross-section angular modulations. In particular, the transverse single spin asymmetries (TSSA) are associated with the Sivers effect for gluons (e.g. see [2]). Probing quark transverse momentum dependent parton distribution functions through J/\u03c8 spin asymmetries might be also possible (similarly to what is suggested in Ref. [3] for the pp collisions) but depends on the relative contribution of the quark-antiquark annihilation process. The challenging part is the interpretation of experimental results due to the lack of theoretical understanding of the charmonia production process. The interpretation is further complicated due to the fact that about 40% J/\u03c8 mesons are produced not directly in parton-parton interaction but through so-called \"feed-down\" decays of \u03c7 c1,c2 \u2192 \u03b3J/\u03c8 and \u03c8(2S) \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0J/\u03c8.",

It is designed as an open spectrometer with a high momentum resolution and allows studying J/\u03c8 alongside with \u03c7 c1 , \u03c7 c2 and \u03c8(2S). Moreover, the high expected statistics should allow for a precise measurement of \u03c8(2S) production properties, that does not suffer from the feed-down contributions, as well as provide an improved measurement of J/\u03c8 TSSA. In general, the experiment is expected to validate current theoretical approaches and use them to interpret observables for polarized beams.

An important consequence of this factorization is the process independence for LDME (e.g. in hadron collisions, photoproduction, e + e \u2212 annihilation). The second point is that there is a hierarchy of LDME O H n with respect to v (v 2 \u223c 0.2 \u2212 0.3) -typical velocity of heavy quark in the charmonium system. The color-octet LDME are obtained from fits to the data. The model predicts the full spectra of observables including J/\u03c8 polarization. Verification of the LDME universality in different J/\u03c8 production processes is one of the direct tests of NRQCD. The Ref. [18] reviews NLO NRQCD fits to different data sets, that include the p T distribution in proton-proton collisions (ATLAS, CDF), the same distribution in photoproduction at H1, the polarization data (CDF) and the J/\u03c8 production in e + e \u2212 annihilation at Belle showing that all available data sets can not be described simultaneously by one set of LDME. Inability to simultaneously describe p T spectra and polarization may be related to the so-called \"polarization puzzle\" -NRQCD difficulties to describe the observed weak J/\u03c8 polarization. One of the possible solutions to the puzzle is significant contribution of the feed-down decays. It is based on the observed difference in polarization between \u03a5(1S) and its radial excitations \u03a5(2S) and \u03a5(3S) measured by E866 [19]. For charmonia Ref. [20] suggests cancellation of \u03c7 c1 and \u03c7 c2 contributions as a possible explanation, while \u03c7 c1 production cross-section is usually strongly underpredicted in NRQCD. New experimental data on \u03c7 cJ contributions and their polarization, as well as polarization measurements for \u03c8(2S) are necessary to verify these ideas. Another problem of the reviewed fits can be fitting of low-p T data, where collinear factorization may not be applicable (typically p T spectra are fitted above 3 GeV or larger cut-off values).",

The description of this kinematics is challenging from the theoretical point of view and requires taking into account transverse momentum of partons. There are several approaches within the framework of NRQCD, that may be suitable for SPD. Firstly, it is Parton Reggeization Approach [21], which is capable of describing the whole J/\u03c8 p T spectra in high energy experiments and has preliminary predictions for SPD. Secondly, there is a set of works applying k T -factorization to charmonia production (see Ref. [22] and following works of the authors). It is important to outline that both these approaches have nontrivial implications for other observables like J/\u03c8 polarization. It has also been a recent attempt to significantly improve color evaporation model [23,24]. Despite good p T description, it fails to describe J/\u03c8 polarization measured at HERA-B [10]. The final detector set-up has not been completed yet (see Ref. [25] for the details and the designed performance). One of its possible configurations is shown in Fig. 4. The detector has close to 4\u03c0 geometrical acceptance and consists of a vertex detector, a straw tracker, an electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) and a range system (RS) for muon identification. The magnet field is provided by the hybrid magnetic system, which is toroidal in the barrel part and solenoidal in the endcaps. The detector is expected to have an average momentum resolution of about 1-2% and the designed energy resolution of ECAL is 5%/ \u221a E. The experiment is expected to accumulate about 20 million J/\u03c8 events during one year of smooth data taking.",

This experimental input would be crucial for the validation of theoretical models (like CEM and NRQCD) and proper factorization approaches at SPD energies. In case of polarized beams, the high statistics and good detector performance will allow for a precise measurement of spin asymmetries.
