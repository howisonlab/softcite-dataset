In this contribution, we present the measurements of the p T spectra of \u039b baryons and K 0 S mesons produced in charged jets in Pb-Pb collisions at \u221a s NN = 2.76 TeV and in p-Pb collisions at \u221a s NN = 5.02 TeV. The results are obtained with the ALICE detector at the LHC, exploiting the excellent particle identification capabilities of this experiment. Baryon-to-meson ratios of the spectra of strange particles associated with jets are studied in central collisions and are compared with the inclusive ratios.",

The effect was first observed at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider [1,2,3] and later at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) as well [4]. The ratio of the inclusive p T spectrum of \u039b baryons to the spectrum of K 0 S mesons measured in lead-lead (Pb-Pb) collisions with the ALICE experiment increases strongly with centrality and, for the most central collisions, reaches a maximum three times higher than the ratio obtained for pp collisions. A smaller but still significant enhancement is manifest in proton-lead (p-Pb) collisions as well [5]. This phenomenon is not understood yet and various mechanisms have been proposed to explain it.",

Jet fragmentation denotes the process of hadron production from a parton with large momentum produced in a hard scattering. The energetic parton undergoes parton showering followed by hadronisation which gives origin to a collimated spray of hadrons called a jet. The process might be sensitive to interactions of fragmenting partons with the stronglyinteracting matter created in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Such interaction might modify properties of the resulting jet, including p T spectra of the hadrons which constitute the jet.",

The mean density of background contributing to the reconstructed jet momenta is estimated in each event from clusters reconstructed with the k t algorithm [13]. The corresponding momentum is then subtracted for each reconstructed jet. In order to increase the probability of selecting a hard scattering in Pb-Pb collisions, thresholds are imposed on jet p T (p > 20 GeV/c. Neutral strange particles (V 0 ) are reconstructed using the topology of their most probable weak decays into charged particles, namely K 0 S \u2192 \u03c0 + + \u03c0 \u2212 , \u039b \u2192 p + \u03c0 \u2212 and \u039b \u2192 p + \u03c0 + . Combinatorial background from fake V 0 candidates is strongly suppressed by cuts applied on parameters of the decay and the signal yields are extracted from the resulting invariant-mass distribution. Spectra of \u039b baryons are analysed separately from those of \u039b baryons and combined into the baryon-to-meson ratio as (\u039b + \u039b)/2K 0 S . If a V 0 candidate fulfils the selection criteria, the angular distance between its momentum vector and the axis of each selected jet in the event is calculated. A jet is considered for matching with V 0 candidates only if its cone is fully contained within the acceptance of V 0 particles: |\u03b7 jet,ch | < |\u03b7 V 0 | max \u2212 R.

Then, spectra of particles in the underlying event are subtracted from spectra of particles in jet cones. The resulting spectra still contain a contamination from decays of jet constituents. The corresponding fraction is subtracted by applying a correction for feed-down from decays of \u039e 0 and \u039e \u2212 baryons (\u039e 0,\u2212 ) into \u039b baryons. Since the spectra of \u039e 0,\u2212 baryons in jets have not been measured yet, the feed-down fraction of inclusive \u039b baryons is used as the default option. To estimate the related systematic uncertainty, we use spectra of hyperons in jets in simulated pp collisions at \u221a s = 2.76 TeV or 5.02 TeV generated by PYTHIA 8, tune 4C [14,15]. Figure 1 shows the ratio of the p T spectra of \u039b and \u039b baryons to that of K 0 S mesons measured in charged jets in high-multiplicity p-Pb collisions for two p jet,ch T thresholds. The ratio is compared with the measured inclusive ratio and with ratios obtained from simulations performed with PYTHIA 8. The measured baryon-tomeson ratio in jets in p-Pb collisions is below the inclusive ratio i) measured in p-Pb collisions, ii) measured in pp collisions [16] (not shown) and iii) obtained with PYTHIA simulations. Moreover, the measured ratio exhibits a surprising similarity with ratios of particles in jets simulated in PYTHIA and does not evince any significant dependence on R or p production in charged jets in p-Pb compared to pp and the enhancement of the baryon-to-meson ratio thus seems to be due to effects of the underlying event. Figure 2 shows the p T dependence of the \u039b/K 0 S ratio measured in charged jets in central Pb-Pb collisions, compared with the inclusive ratio measured in centrality range 0-5 %. The ratio measured for particles in jets  is significantly lower than the inclusive ratio at intermediate p T without exhibiting any dependence on the p jet,ch T threshold. The ratio in jets and the inclusive ratio meet at higher p T where production by jet fragmentation starts to be the dominant hadronisation process.",
