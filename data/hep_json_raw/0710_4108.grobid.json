The charge asymmetry is the first direct measurement, which uses a new technique to reconstruct the W rapidity by constraining its mass; the result will further constrain Parton Distribution Functions in future fits. The width measurement relies on a fit to the W transverse mass distribution. We measure \u0393W = 2032 \u00b1 71 MeV which is in good agreement with the Standard Model prediction.",

            "text": "1. Introduction W bosons are produced at the Tevatron proton-antiproton collider via quark-antiquark annihilation. They quickly decay into two fermions which, due to the large mass of the W , typically have a high momentum in the direction transverse to the beam, p T . The leptonic decay channels have a clean experimental signature and can therefore be utilised to make precision measurements of W properties, such as its width (\u0393 W ) and mass (M W ), and to probe the quantum-chromodynamic (QCD) aspects of the production mechanism. This document describes a measurement of the W charge asymmetry made in the e\u03bd decay channel and \u0393 W , made in the e\u03bd and \u00b5\u03bd decay channels, using 350 pb \u22121 of CDF Run II data.",

This distribution is a convolution of A(y W ) and the W \u2192 e\u03bd angular decay structure and places a less strong constraint on PDFs than A(y W ). This analysis extracts A(y W ) by constraining M W = 80.4 GeV/c 2 , giving two possible solutions for p \u03bd z . Each solution receives a probability weight according to the decay structure and \u03c3(W \u00b1 ). The W charge asymmetry is then extracted after correcting for detector effects. The process is iterated to eliminate any dependence of the weighting factor on the asymmetry itself. The measured W charge asymmetry is compared to the prediction from PDFs using CTEQ5L and the corresponding error from the CTEQ6.1 [1] error sets in Figure 1. The experimental uncertainties are lower than the uncertainties from the PDFs indicating that they will help to constrain the PDFs in future fits.  Figure 1.

The electron energy is measured in the calorimeter and the momentum is measured in the drift chamber 1 . The well calibrated momentum measurement can therefore be used to calibrate both the calorimeter scale and resolution, using the ratio between the electron energy measured in the calorimeter and the track momentum (E/p) in W \u2192 e\u03bd events. The scale and resolution are also obtained from the Z \u2192 ee resonance peak and the results are combined. The neutrino p T is determined from the missing transverse energy, E / T , in the detector. A recoil vector, U , is defined as the vector sum of the transverse energy in all calorimeter towers, excluding those surrounding the lepton. The E / T is then defined as -( U + p T ). The recoil is represented by a parameterised model, which is tuned to Z \u2192 events.",

This result reduces the world average central value by 44 MeV and uncertainty by 22%. CDF has also made an indirect measurement of \u0393 W , obtained from a measurement of the ratio of the cross-section times branching ratio for leptonically decaying W 's and Z's [5].
