Data collected during 2015 and 2016 by the ATLAS experiment from 13 TeV proton-proton collisions at the LHC corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb \u22121 are used. Two channels are considered, depending on the leptonic or the hadronic decays of the W boson from the top quark. The obtained results are interpreted in the context of simplified models for dark-matter production and for the single production of a vector-like T quark. In the absence of significant deviations from the Standard Model background expectation, 95% confidence-level upper limits on the corresponding production cross-sections are obtained and these limits are translated into constraints on the parameter space of the models considered.",

            "text": "One argument supporting the idea that new particles beyond the SM might exist arises from astrophysical measurements, such as the rotational speed of stars in galaxies and gravitational lensing [1][2][3]. These observations point to the existence of non-light-emitting matter, a dominant fraction of which is of non-baryonic form, usually referred to as dark matter (DM). Even if there are no viable candidates in the SM for particles which could explain DM, proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) may possibly produce new particles that couple both to SM particles and to these DM candidates. While such candidates are not expected to interact significantly with detectors, the SM particles JHEP05(2019)041 produced in association with the unobserved DM particles could allow these processes to be detected. Search strategies depend on the type of particle or system that is recoiling against the unseen particle. Both ATLAS and CMS have carried out searches for invisible particles produced in association with jets [4][5][6][7], photons [8,9], W or Z bosons [5,10,11] and Higgs bosons [12][13][14][15], significantly constraining the allowed parameter space for different classes of models predicting DM candidates.",

Such a final state, commonly referred to as \"mono-top\", is characterised by a top-quark and significant missing transverse momentum, which is due to the undetected particles. Background contributions from SM processes [16] are expected to be small. In addition, this search is sensitive to specific DM models, since the presence of top-quarks in the final state constrains the flavour structure of the considered couplings [17,18]. Similar searches were previously conducted by the CDF Collaboration using 7.7 fb \u22121 of Tevatron pp collisions at \u221a s = 1.96 TeV [19] and by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations using \u221a s = 8 TeV [20,21] and \u221a s = 13 TeV [22] LHC data. Searches for new phenomena in events with same-charge leptons and b-tagged jets [23] provide information complementary to the results from mono-top searches and exclude new vector resonances with masses up to 3 TeV, assuming a dark-sector coupling of 1.0 and a coupling to SM particles above 0.3.",

            "text": "A final state with a top-quark and missing transverse momentum can also originate from the single production of new vector-like quarks if these decay into a top-quark and a Z boson that decays invisibly into two neutrinos. Vector-like quarks are colour-triplet spin-1/2 fermions in which, in contrast to the SM quarks, the left-and right-handed components have the same properties under transformations of the electroweak symmetry group SU(2) L \u00d7 U(1) Y . Such new particles are predicted in SM extensions, such as Little Higgs [24,25] and Composite Higgs [26,27] models, and are expected to mix with SM quarks [28]. In order to preserve gauge invariance, only a limited set of possible representations exist [29,30] and their electric charge can be +2/3e (T quark), \u22121/3e (B quark), +5/3e (X quark) or \u22124/3e (Y quark), with e being the elementary charge. In this paper, only the single production of vector-like T quarks (VLT) via an electroweak interaction is considered. Although couplings of T quarks to first-and second-generation SM quarks are not excluded [31,32], it is common to assume that they couple exclusively to third-generation SM quarks [33]. Such couplings can be described in terms of sin \u03b8 L [34], where \u03b8 L is the mixing angle of the T quark with the top-quark, or in terms of a generalised coupling \u03ba T [35,36]. The T quarks can decay either via the charged current, i.e. T \u2192 W b, or via flavour-changing neutral currents [37], i.e. T \u2192 Zt and T \u2192 Ht. The T \u2192 Zt \u2192 \u03bd\u03bdW b decay is considered in the present search.",

Searches at 13 TeV have aimed at final states with leptons, targeting the T \u2192 Zt decay [42,43], the T \u2192 W b decay [44,45], as well as general single-lepton and fully hadronic final states with boosted bosons [46,47] and multiple b-JHEP05(2019)041 tagged jets [46,48,49]. The most stringent mass limit for an isospin singlet T is 1.3 TeV [50]. For such large T masses, the cross-section for single T production may be larger than the pair-production cross-section because of the larger available phase space. Nonetheless, the comparison of single-and pair-production cross-sections depends on the assumed coupling to the SM quarks. Single production of T quarks was sought at 8 TeV [40,51,52] by the ATLAS Collaboration. At 13 TeV, the ATLAS and CMS collaborations have sought the decays T \u2192 W b [53,54], T \u2192 Ht [55,56] and T \u2192 Zt [43, 57,58].",

However, ZT t production is suppressed because of the required top quark in the initial state. For this reason, ZT t production is not considered in this analysis and single VLT production refers to T production via the W T b vertex throughout this paper. The T quarks can decay into bW , tH and tZ, with the corresponding branching ratios (B) depending on the specific model considered [33,36]. The specific case of single production of vector-like T quarks decaying into tZ, followed by the Z boson decaying into neutrinos, results in a mono-top signature. As can be seen in JHEP05(2019)041 figure 1(d), one important difference between DM production and vector-like T -quark production is the presence of additional quarks in the single production of T quarks, which will lead to at least one jet being detected at a small angle relative to the beam line. Similarly to the DM case, the topology of the VLT signal has a distinctive signature, characterised by the presence of a top-quark and missing transverse momentum, arising from the Z \u2192 \u03bd\u03bd decay (and from the t \u2192 bW \u2192 \u03bd decay in the single-lepton channel case).",

Lead/liquid-argon (LAr) sampling calorimeters provide electromagnetic (EM) energy measurements with high granularity for |\u03b7| < 3.2. A steel/scintillator-tile hadron calorimeter covers the central pseudorapidity range (|\u03b7| < 1.7). The endcap and forward regions are instrumented with LAr calorimeters for both the EM and hadronic energy measurements up to |\u03b7| = 4.9. The outer part of the detector includes a muon spectrometer with high-precision tracking chambers providing coverage up to |\u03b7| = 2.7, fast detectors for triggering over |\u03b7| < 2.4, and three large air-core toroidal superconducting magnets with eight coils each. A two-level trigger system [64], using custom hardware followed by a software-based trigger level, is used to select events of interest at an average rate of 1 kHz.",

Such generation was done at leading order (LO) using the NNPDF3.0LO [69] parton distribution function (PDF) set. Parton showering, hadronisation and underlying-event modelling were handled using the Pythia 8.212 [70] event generator with the A14 [71] set of tuned parameters, using the NNPDF2.3LO PDF set [72]. Signal samples for the resonant model were generated assuming a DM mass of m \u03c7 = 10 GeV and a range of the new scalar masses, m \u03c6 , between 1 TeV and 5 TeV, representing two different kinematic regimes. The kinematic distributions predicted by the model have only a small dependence on the coupling parameters and therefore all samples were generated using a coupling constant of \u03bb = 0.2 and a mixing parameter of y = 0.4. The remaining kinematic dependence on the different couplings and masses was accounted for by means of a reweighting procedure (see section 8 for details). Similarly, the signal samples for the non-resonant model were generated for values of m V between 500 GeV and 3 TeV, corresponding to the expected sensitivity of the analysis, and a benchmark DM mass m \u03c7 = 1 GeV. The values of the couplings were set to a = 0.5 and g \u03c7 = 1.0. The kinematic effect of changing the coupling values was taken into account by using the previously mentioned reweighting procedure. The samples were normalised to the theoretical LO cross-sections, computed with MadGraph5 aMC@NLO.",

Since the current analysis targets a final state with large missing transverse momentum, only the T \u2192 Zt decay, with Z decaying invisibly, was considered, as represented in figure 1(d). Samples were generated for T masses in the range from 700 to 2000 GeV with a benchmark coupling of \u03ba T = 0.5 in the W T b production vertex. Additional samples were generated with alternative values of \u03ba T = 0.1 and 1.0 in order to study the effect of a varying T -quark width on kinematic distributions. The samples were normalised to the nextto-leading-order (NLO) cross-section by correcting the LO cross-sections calculated with MadGraph5 aMC@NLO for the difference between the NLO and LO cross-sections reported for the neutral single-T production process via a ZT t coupling [36]. For large values of the coupling the narrow-width approximation used in the cross-section calculation does not apply, so the cross-sections were corrected to include width effects, using a reweighting procedure similar to that previously mentioned, in order to account for the corresponding kinematic effects.",

In the leptonic channel the multijet background originates from either misidentification of a jet as a lepton candidate (fake lepton) or from the presence of a non-prompt lepton (e.g., from a semileptonic b-or c-hadron decay) that passes the isolation requirement. The shape and the normalisation of the relevant distributions in multijet events and related systematic uncertainties are estimated using a matrix method in the electron channel and the anti-muon method in the muon channel [117]. The matrix method exploits differences in efficiencies to pass loose or tight quality requirements [98] between prompt leptons, obtained from W and Z decays, and non-prompt or fake lepton candidates, from the misidentification of photons or jets. These efficiencies are measured in dedicated control regions. The prompt lepton efficiencies are measured as a function of the p T of the leading jet and the angular distance between the lepton and its nearest jet, while the non-prompt or fake efficiencies are parameterised in terms of the p T of the leading jet, the angle in the transverse plane between the lepton and the E miss T and the b-tagged jet multiplicity. Multijet background events containing nonprompt muons are modelled with the anti-muon method using a sample of events enriched in non-isolated muons [117]. Most of these events originate from b-or c-hadron decays in jets. These events pass the kinematic requirements of the selections described in section 5. Only some of the muon identification criteria are modified, ensuring there is no overlap with the signal selection. The normalisation is determined using a binned maximum-likelihood fit to the number of events observed in data in a control region dominated by multijet events. This region is defined with the preselection criteria, but removing the requirement on E miss T and requiring m W T < 60 GeV. In the hadronic channel the estimation of the multijet background is performed using a set of control regions (B,C and D) dominated by multijet background and defined to be orthogonal to the considered signal region (0L-DM-SR or 0L-VLT-SR).

Since the W /Z + jets background is constrained by a control region with a veto on b-tagged jets, an additional uncertainty related to the b-flavour content in the W /Z + jets background is taken into account by varying the number of events containing b-hadrons by 50% [124,125].

For the testing of the non-resonant DM signal, both the 1L and 0L regions are used simultaneously in the fit (two signal regions and four control regions). For the resonant DM and VLT tests the fits are performed in the corresponding 0L regions, one signal region and two control regions for each fit. Uncertainties due to the limited size of the simulated samples are taken into account in each bin of the fitted distributions. Nuisance parameters accounting for systematic uncertainties are not considered in the fit if they have an impact on either normalisation or shape which is below 1%.  and also smoothed if the bin-to-bin statistical variation is significant. Most uncertainties are found to be neither significantly constrained nor pulled from their initial values.

The observed (expected) 95% CL upper limit contours for the signal strength \u03c3/\u03c3 theory are shown in figures 5(a)-5(c) for the non-resonant model, in which \u03c3 is the observed (expected) limit on the model crosssection at a given point of the parameter space and \u03c3 theory is the predicted cross-section in the model at the same point.

This can be seen in figure 6(a), which shows the expected and observed 95% CL upper limits on c W , taken as the sum in quadrature of the left-and right-handed couplings c L,W and c R,W , as a function of the VLT mass. Nonetheless, the sensitivity remains approximately constant for masses up to 1.4 TeV. A singlet T , which corresponds to B(T \u2192 Zt) \u2248 25% over the mass range studied in this analysis, was assumed. The obtained limits on c W can also be translated into expected and observed 95% CL upper limits for the mixing angle of a singlet T with the SM top-quark, as shown in figure 6(b). For these results, a signal reweighting procedure was adopted in order to take into account the width effects induced by the variation of the c W coupling. The systematic uncertainty in the signal normalisation was estimated to be 3% from dedicated MC samples and was considered when deriving the limits shown in figure 6. In the range m(T ) > 1.1 TeV, the obtained exclusion limit on the c W coupling improves on the previous results [43].",
