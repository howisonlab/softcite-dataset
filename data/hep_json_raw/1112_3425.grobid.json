This is    about two thirds of the corresponding SK-I value. The main contributions to the improvement are the vertex shift, angular resolution, and event selection uncertainties. The total live time for solar neutrino analysis in SK-III is 548 days for E total \u2265 6.5 MeV, and 289 days for E total < 6.5 MeV. The recoil electron's total energy range used for this analysis is from 5.0 to 20 MeV. The observed 8 B solar neutrino flux via the ES reaction is 2.32 \u00b1 0.04(stat.) \u00b1 0.05(syst.)

The two flavor analysis for the determination of the solar oscillation parameters, \u03b8 12 and \u2206m 2 12 was performed with the combined SK-I, II and III data. In this analysis, the total 8 B flux is constrained by the averaged NC flux from SNO NCD [6] and LETA [7] (= (5.14 \u00b1 0.21) \u00d7 10 6 /cm 2 /s). The result is shown in the left side in Figure 7. As shown in the left figure, the LOW solution is excluded and the LMA solution is only allowed to explain the solar neutrino oscillation. We have also done a preliminary global oscillation analysis with other solar experiments. In this analysis, the following observation results are used; SNO total CC rates observed in the 306-day pure D 2 O phase (SNO-I) [8], 391-day salt phases (SNO-II) [9], and 385-day NCD phase (SNO-III) [6], the combined NC rates of LETA [7] and SNO-III, the predicted day-night asymmetry for SNO-I and II, 7 Be solar neutrino flux from Borexino [10], Homestake [11], GALLEX-GNO [12], and SAGE [13]. The result is shown in the right side in Figure 7. The best-fit parameter set is tan 2 \u03b8 12 = 0.42 +0.04 \u22120.02 and \u2206m 2 21 = (6.2 +1.1 \u22121.9 ) \u00d7 10 \u22125 eV 2 . In addition, combining the above and Kam-LAND data [14], the best-fit parameter set becomes tan 2 \u03b8 12 = 0.44\u00b10.03 and \u2206m 2 21 = (7.6\u00b10.2)\u00d710 \u22125 eV 2 . We also performed a preliminary 3-flavor oscillation analysis. In the 3-flavor analysis, the calculation of oscillation probability is based on reference [15]. The probability can be calculated with three parameters: \u03b8 12 , \u03b8 13 , and \u2206m 2 12 , assuming \u2206m 2 12 \u2206m 2 23 \u223c \u2206m 2 13 . We fixed \u2206m 2 23 = 2.4 \u00d7 10 \u22123 eV 2 and the normal hierarchy is assumed. For the solar neutrino oscillation, the other mixing parameters are irrelevant, but we set \u03b8 23 = \u03c0/4 and \u03b4 CP = 0 in our calculation.",
