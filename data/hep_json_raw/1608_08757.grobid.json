The combined analysis of the e + e \u2212 \u2192 K + K \u2212 and e + e \u2212 \u2192 K S K L cross sections and the spectral function in the \u03c4 \u2212 \u2192 K \u2212 K 0 \u03bd \u03c4 decay allows to test the conserved-vector-current hypothesis, as well as to separate isovector and isoscalar parts of the \u03b3 * \u2192 KK amplitude.

The main part of the detector is a three-layer electromagnetic calorimeter [4] consisting of 1640 NaI(Tl) crystals. The total thickness of the calorimeter is 13.4 radiation lengths. Its energy resolution for photons is \u03c3 E /E = 4.2%/ 4 E(GeV), and the angular resolution is \u03c3 \u03c6 , \u03c3 \u03b8 \u2243 1.5 \u2022 . The solid-angle coverage of the calorimeter is about 95% of the 4\u03c0. Inside the calorimeter, a nine-layer drift chamber [5] is installed, which is used for measurement of directions and production points of charged particles. Charged particle identification is based on information from the system of threshold aerogel Cherenkov counters (ACC) [6]. It consists of 9 counters, which form a cylinder located directly behind the drift chamber. The thickness of the aerogel is about 30 mm. The counters cover the polar angle range 50 \u2022 < \u03b8 < 132 \u2022 . The Cherenkov light is collected using wavelength shifters located inside the aerogel radiator. In the data analysis, the coordinates of the particle entrance to ACC are calculated. Information from ACC is used only if the particle track extrapolates to the ACC active area that excludes the regions of shifters and gaps between counters. The active area is 81% of the ACC area. There are two ACC options, with a refractive index of 1.05 and 1.13. At energies above the threshold of kaons production ACC with the higher refractive index is used, and a kaon is identified by the requirement of no Cherenkov signal in ACC. For pions, the threshold momentum is about 265 MeV/c.",

Such a distribution for selected data events from the energy range \u221a s = 1.4 \u2212 1.6 GeV is shown in Fig. 1. The dashed lines indicate the boundaries of the conditions on \u2206\u03c6 and \u2206\u03b8. The central box in the plot is a signal region corresponding to the standard selection criteria for e + e \u2212 \u2192 K + K \u2212 candidates. The peak of signal and background collinear processes is clearly seen in the center of the signal region. Noncollinear processes is expected to have a flat \u2206\u03c6 vs \u2206\u03b8 distribution. The number of noncollinear background events in the signal region (n bkg ) is estimated from the number of events in four regions located in the corners of the two-dimensional plot (n \u2032 bkg ) as n bkg = \u03b1 bkg n \u2032 bkg . The value of the \u03b1 bkg coefficient is estimated from Monte Carlo (MC) simulation of the main noncollinear background processes e + e \u2212 \u2192 3\u03c0, e + e \u2212 \u2192 4\u03c0, e + e \u2212 \u2192 K + K \u2212 \u03c0 0 , e + e \u2212 \u2192 K + K \u2212 \u03b7 and found to be equal to unity with 10% uncertanty. Figure 2 shows the distribution of the normalized total energy deposition in the calorimeter E tot / \u221a s for data events from the signal region. The shaded histogram shows the contribution of noncollinear background events estimated using the procedure described above. In further analysis, the noncollinear background is subtracted from the number of events in the signal region. Its fraction changes slowly from 3% at 1.1 GeV to 5% at 1.65 GeV, and then increases up to 40% at \u221a s > 1.8 GeV.",

It should be noted that the requirement of no ACC signal for one of the charged particles suppresses e + e \u2212 \u2192 e + e \u2212 and e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 events by a factor of about 300. Background from the e + e \u2212 \u2192 pp process is completely rejected by the selection criteria used, in particular, the requirement on dE/dx. The E tot / \u221a s distribution for e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 events is close to that for kaons. Their fraction under the kaon peak calculated using MC simulation decreases from 5% at 1.2 GeV to 0.1% at \u221a s = 1.6 GeV, and then increases reaching about 8% at 1.8 GeV. The calculation uses the e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 cross section measured in Ref. [16]. The accuracy of the e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 simulation and, in particular, the probability for a pion to not produce a signal in ACC are tested in the energy range 1.05 \u2265 \u221a s \u2264 1.15 GeV, where the cross section of this process is relatively high. The standard criteria are applied to select e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 events, except the condition on (dE/dx), which is inverted to suppress events with kaons: are suppressed by the requirement E tot / \u221a s < 0.7, while e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 and cosmic background is rejected by the muon-system veto and the condition that the energy deposition in the upper half of the calorimeter is outside the range of the peak from minimum-ionizing particles. The number of selected e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 events coincides with the number expected from simulation within 10%. This value is taken as an estimate of the systematic uncertainty on the pion background calculation.",

The distributions for background processes are obtained from data. A practically pure sample of e + e \u2212 \u2192 e + e \u2212 events is selected by the requirement that one of the particles in an event passes through the ACC active area and produces a Cherenkov signal. The muon distribution is obtained using events selected with the requirement that the muon system fires. The E tot / \u221a s distribution for such events is shown in Fig. 3. It is seen that the muon peak survives, while kaon and electron events are strongly suppressed. To study the distribution for cosmic muons, the condition on the parameters d i is modified: 0.25 < |d 1,2 | < 0.5. This allows to reject e + e \u2212 annihilation events and obtain a pure spectrum of cosmic muons. It is found that the muon distribution consist of two components. One of the components, with higher energy deposition, contains e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 events and events with energetic cosmic muons. The other component contains cosmic muons with momentum less than the threshold momentum for muons in ACC.

The identification correction is determined as follows. The cross section for e + e \u2212 \u2192 K + K \u2212 is measured for two sets of selection criteria. In the first set it is required that both particles pass through the active ACC area, but only one of them is identified as a kaon (no signal in ACC).

The systematic uncertainties associated with the subtraction of the noncollinear and e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 backgrounds are discussed in Sec. IV. Accuracy of the subtraction of the muon and electron backgrounds in the fit to the E tot / \u221a s distribution is tested by the comparison of the cross sections measured on events with one and two identified kaons. The ratio of the cross sections is described by the coefficient c id . Since both electron and muon contributions to the E tot / \u221a s spectra with these two selections are strongly different (see Fig. 2 and 4) and the c id value is consistent with unity, we do not introduce an additional systematic uncertainty associated with the fit to the E tot / \u221a s distribution. A part of kaon events is lost due to the kaon nuclear interaction in the material before the drift chamber. Its thickness is about 0.5% of the nuclear interaction length. Taking into account that the cross sections for the charged kaon nuclear interactions are well known, we estimate that the systematic uncertainty associated with the kaon nuclear interaction does not exceed 0.1%. The theoretical uncertainty on the radiative correction calculation is less than 0.1% [17].",
