            "text": "We report a measurement of the ratio of branching fractions of the decays B AE ! J=c AE and B AE ! J=c K AE using the CDF II detector at the Fermilab Tevatron Collider. The signal from the Cabbibosuppressed B AE ! J=c AE decay is separated from B AE ! J=c K AE using the B AE ! J=c K AE invariant mass distribution and the kinematical differences of the hadron track in the two decay modes. From a sample of 220 pb \u00c01 of p p collisions at ffiffi ffi s p \u00bc 1:96 TeV, we observe 91 AE 15 B AE ! J=c AE events together with 1883 AE 34 B AE ! J=c K AE events. The ratio of branching fractions is found to be B\u00f0B AE ! J=c AE \u00de=B\u00f0B AE ! J=c K AE \u00de \u00bc \u00f04:86 AE 0:82\u00f0stat\u00de AE 0:15\u00f0syst\u00de\u00de%. The B AE ! J=c AE decay is a Cabibbo-suppressed mode proceeding via a b ! c cd transition. If the leading-order tree diagram is the dominant contribution, its branching fraction is expected to be % 5% of that of the Cabibbo-favored mode B AE ! J=c K AE . Detailed predictions of the ratio are obtained using the hypothesis of factorization of the hadronic matrix elements [1,2], a theoretical approach widely used in the treatment of nonleptonic decays of B mesons. However, the absence of strong theoretical arguments supporting factorization and the use of phenomenological models, which are a source of theoretical uncertainties, weaken the reliability of those predictions, which need to be accurately tested on data. Until now, the measurements on the B AE ! J=c AE decay were performed by many experiments. The BABAR collaboration reported B\u00f0B AE ! J=c AE \u00de=B\u00f0B AE ! J=c K AE \u00de \u00bc \u00f05:37 AE 0:45\u00de% with 244 AE 20 B AE ! J=c AE events [3]. The Belle collaboration reported B\u00f0B AE ! J=c AE \u00de \u00bc \u00f03:8 AE 0:6\u00de \u00c2 10 \u00c05 [4]. A previous study of the B AE ! J=c AE decay was also performed by the CLEO collaboration [5]. The result of this analysis supersedes the previous CDF result [6].",

Trajectories are reconstructed from hits in the silicon microstrip detector [9] and the central outer tracker (COT) [10] which are immersed in a 1.4 T solenoidal magnetic field. The silicon microstrip detector consists of five concentric layers made of double-sided silicon detectors with radii between 2.5 and 10.6 cm, each providing a position measurement with 15 m resolution in the r \u00c0 plane. The COT is an open-cell drift chamber with 96 measurement layers, between 40 and 137 cm in radius, organized into eight alternating axial and AE2 stereo superlayers. The transverse momentum (p T ) resolution is p T =p T ' 0:15%p T \u00f0GeV=c\u00de \u00c01 . Muon detectors consisting of multilayer drift chambers are located radially around the outside of the calorimeter [11]. The central muon detector (CMU) covers a range in the pseudorapidity of jj < 0:6. The central muon extension (CMX) extends the pseudorapidity coverage to 0:6 < jj < 1:0.",

At the first trigger level, muon candidates are identified by matching track segments in the CMU and CMX to coarsely reconstructed COT tracks obtained with the extremely fast tracker [12]. Dimuon triggers use combinations of CMU-CMU and CMU-CMX muons with p T > 1:5\u00f02:0\u00de GeV=c for CMU (CMX) muons. For the data presented here, no additional requirements are made at the second level.

After a J=c candidate is identified, any other charged track is assumed to be a kaon and is combined with the J=c candidate to make a B AE candidate. The tracks of the kaon and two muons are then fitted to a common three dimensional vertex (3D) while constraining the invariant mass of two muons to the world average J=c mass [14].

To reduce prompt background, the transverse decay length (L xy ) of the B AE is required to exceed 200 m, where L xy is defined as the vector from the primary vertex to the B AE decay vertex projected onto the p T of the B AE candidate. To further reduce combinatorial background, we require p T > 6:5 GeV=c for the B AE candidate and p T > 2:0 GeV=c for the hadron from the B AE decay.

            "text": "Since both decay modes of interest have almost identical decay topology and kinematics, most systematic uncertainties cancel in this ratio measurement, including uncertainties in total integrated luminosity and trigger and reconstruction efficiencies. Remaining systematic uncertainties come from the uncertainties in the shapes of the mass distribution, the parametrized PDFs in the variable, and from the determination of the relative reconstruction efficiency. The largest systematic uncertainty originates from the unknown shape of the combinatorial background in the mass distribution. To estimate this effect, a second order polynomial function is considered as an alternative model for the shape of the background mass distribution. The modeling of the width of the invariant mass distribution is determined from momentum scale resolution studies [13]. An alternative model from a simple Gaussian is to include an additional Gaussian for potential different momentum resolutions of tracks reconstructed in different detector geometry coverage. We replace a Gaussian with a double Gaussian for modeling each signal mass distribution and fit again to evaluate the uncertainty coming from the non-Gaussian tails in the B AE ! J=c K AE mass distri-  bution. The uncertainties in the function parameters describing the PDFs, in Eqs. (3) and 4, generate an uncertainty for the ratio measurement. The contribution of this uncertainty is estimated by performing the fit by varying the parametrzation variables of the PDFs by the AE1, obtained from Monte Carlo simulation. The uncertainty in rel originates from the uncertainties of the nuclear interaction and the material description in the detector simulation. The GEANT simulation calculates nuclear interaction probabilities of % 4% for \u00fe , \u00c0 and K \u00c0 , and % 3% for K \u00fe . We then assign a 25% uncertainty to the calculated nuclear interaction probabilities as the uncertainty of the detector material description in the detector simulation and take the resulting uncertainty in rel as a systematic uncertainty. We determine the total systematic uncertainty of 3.0% on the measurement by adding the individual uncertainties in quadrature, and the contributions from each source are summarized in Table I. From Eq. 1, we derived the ratio of branching fractions, B\u00f0B AE ! J=c AE \u00de B\u00f0B AE ! J=c K AE \u00de \u00bc \u00f04:86 AE 0:82\u00f0stat\u00de AE 0:15\u00f0syst\u00de\u00de%;",

There are three components in the distribution of the M J=c K variable: the B AE ! J=c K AE signal, the B AE ! J=c AE signal, and the combinatorial background. As demonstrated in the high statistics D and B mass reconstructions with similar decay topology, the invariant mass distribution of B AE ! J=c K AE decay at CDF is well described by a Gaussian function with a width determined by CDF's tracking resolution [13,15,16]. Therefore, we model the B AE ! J=c K AE signal as a Gaussian centered at the mass of B AE (M B ) with a width K . If the pion mass were assigned to the hadron track originating from the B AE ! J=c AE decay, the resulting spectrum would also be a Gaussian centered at M B . However, assigning the kaon mass to this track produces a spectrum partially overlapping the B AE ! J=c K AE and shifted in the positive direction. The shifted invariant mass of B AE ! J=c AE can be calculated by an approximation, which has a good agreement with the exact value [17],",
