LbL scattering processes are selected in events with just two photons produced, with transverse energy E \u03b3 T > 2 GeV, pseudorapidity |\u03b7 \u03b3 | < 2.4; and diphoton invariant mass m \u03b3\u03b3 > 5 GeV, transverse momentum p \u03b3\u03b3 T < 1 GeV, and acoplanarity (1 \u2212 \u0394\u03c6 \u03b3\u03b3 /\u03c0) < 0.01. After all selection criteria, 14 events are observed, compared to 11.1 \u00b1 1.1 (theo) and 3.8 \u00b1 1.3 (stat) events expected for signal and background processes respectively. The significance of the signal excess over the background-only hypothesis is 4.1\u03c3. The measured fiducial LbL scattering cross section, \u03c3 fid (\u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3) = 122 \u00b1 46 (stat) \u00b129 (syst) \u00b14 (theo) nb is consistent with the standard model prediction.",

            "text": "Elastic light-by-light (LbL) scattering, \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3, is a pure quantum mechanical process that proceeds, at leading order in the quantum electrodynamics (QED) coupling \u03b1, via virtual box diagrams containing charged particles (Fig. 1, left). In the standard model (SM), the box diagram involves leptons, quarks, and W \u00b1 bosons. Its direct observation in the laboratory remains elusive still today due to a very suppressed production cross section proportional to \u03b1 4 \u2248 3 \u00d7 10 \u22129 . In Ref. [1], it was proposed to observe the LbL process at the LHC via ultraperipheral heavy-ion interactions, with impact parameters larger than twice the radius of the nuclei, exploiting the very large fluxes of quasi-real photons emitted by the nuclei accelerated at TeV energies [2]. For lead (Pb) nuclei with radius R \u2248 7 fm, the quasi-real photon beams have virtualities \u2212Q 2 \u2248 1/R < 10 \u22123 GeV 2 , and since each photon flux scales as the square of the ion charge Z 2 , \u03b3\u03b3 scattering cross sections in PbPb collisions are enhanced by a factor of Z 4 5 \u00d7 10 7 compared to similar proton-proton (pp) or e + e \u2212 interactions. A first evidence of \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 has been reported by the ATLAS experiment [3] with a signal significance of 4.4\u03c3 (3.8\u03c3 expected). The study of the \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 process at the LHC has also been proposed for searches of physics beyond the SM, such as axions [4], or Born-Infeld extensions of QED [5].",

The dominant backgrounds are the QED production of an exclusive electron-positron pair (\u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 e + e \u2212 , Fig. 1 center) where the e \u00b1 are misidentified as photons, and gluon-induced central exclusive production (CEP) [6] of a pair of photons ( Fig. 1, right). Simulations of the light-by-light signal are generated with madgraph v.5 [7] Monte Carlo (MC) generator, modified [1,8] to include the nuclear \u03b3 fluxes and the elementary LbL scattering cross section [9]. Background QED e + e \u2212 events are generated with starlight v2.76 [10]. The CEP process, gg \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3, is simulated with superchic 2.0 [11], where the computed pp cross section [6] is conservatively scaled to the PbPb case by multiplying it by A 2 R 4 g , where A = 208 is the lead mass number and R g \u2248 0.7 is a gluon shadowing correction in the relevant kinematical range [12], and where the rapidity gap survival factor is taken as 100%. Given the large theoretical uncertainty of the CEP process for PbPb collisions, the absolute normalization of this MC contribution is directly determined from a control region in the data.",

Exclusive diphoton candidates are selected with a dedicated level-1 trigger that requires at least two electromagnetic (e.m.) clusters with E T above 2 GeV and at least one HF detector with total energy below the noise threshold. Offline, photons and electrons are reconstructed with the particle flow algorithm [14]. In the case of photons, to keep to a minimum the e \u00b1 contamination, we require them to be fully unconverted. Additional particle identification (ID) criteria are applied to remove \u03b3 from high-p T \u03c0 0 decays, based on a shower shape analysis. Electron candidates are identified by the association of a charged-particle track from the primary vertex with clusters of energy deposits in the ECAL.

Nonexclusive backgrounds, characterized by a final state with larger transverse momenta and larger diphoton acoplanarities, A \u03c6 = (1 \u2212 \u0394\u03c6 \u03b3\u03b3 /\u03c0), than the back-to-back exclusive \u03b3\u03b3 events, are eliminated by requiring the transverse momentum of the diphoton system to be p \u03b3\u03b3 T < 1 GeV, and the acoplanarity of the pair to be A \u03c6 < 0.01. The same analysis carried out for the LbL events is done first on exclusive e + e \u2212 candidates, with the exception that exactly two opposite-sign electrons, instead of exactly two photons, are exclusively reconstructed. Figure 2 (top left) shows the acoplanarity distribution measured in exclusive QED e + e \u2212 events passing all selection criteria (circles) compared to the starlight MC expectation (histogram). A good data-simulation agreement is found, thereby confirming the quality of the e.m. particle reconstruction, of the exclusive event selection criteria, as well as of the UPC MC predictions [1,10]. Small data-MC differences seen in the m e + e \u2212 tail -due to the presence of slightly acoplanar events in data, likely from \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 e + e \u2212 events where one (or both) electrons radiate an extra soft photon, that are not explicitly simulated-have no impact on the final extracted cross sections integrated over the whole distribution. The QED dielectron background is then directly estimated from the starlight MC simulation by counting the number of e + e \u2212 events that pass all LbL scattering selection criteria. The charged exclusivity condition, requiring no track in the event above the p T = 0.1 GeV threshold, is successful in removing it almost entirely (Fig. 2, top-right). The simulated CEP gg \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 events, with large theoretical uncertainties, plus any other residual backgrounds resulting in non-fully back-to-back photons for which we do not have a simulated sample available, are normalized to match the data in the region A \u03c6 > 0.02, where the contribution from \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 is negligible (Fig. 2, top-right). The CEP MC background normalization factor is f norm nonacoplanar = 0.95 \u00b1 0.36 (stat). The final requirement on diphoton acoplanarity (A \u03c6 < 0.01) leads to a significant reduction of CEP photon pairs that are produced in diffractive-like processes [6,11] with larger momentum exchanges, leading to a pair distribution peaking at p \u03b3\u03b3 T \u2248 0.5 GeV, and have moderately large tails in their azimuthal acoplanarity. After all cuts, we observe 14 LbL scattering candidates, to be compared with 11.1 \u00b1 1.1 (theo) expected from the LbL scattering signal, 2.7\u00b11.1 (stat) from CEP plus any residual \u03b3\u03b3 backgrounds, and 1.1\u00b10.6 (stat) from misidentified QED e + e \u2212 events. Figure 2 (bottom) shows the \u03b3\u03b3 invariant mass (left) and p \u03b3\u03b3 T (right) measured in data (squares) compared to MC expectations. Both the measured total yields and kinematic distributions are in accord with the combination of the LbL scattering signal plus exclusive QED e + e \u2212 and CEP+other backgrounds. The compatibility of the data with a background-only hypothesis is evaluated from the measured acoplanarity distribution (Fig. 2, top-right), using a profile-likelihood ratio as a test statistic. The observed (expected) signal significance is 4.1 (4.4) standard deviations. The ratio R of cross sections of the light-by-light scattering over the QED e + e \u2212 processes is determined from the expression: R = \u03c3 fid (\u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3) \u03c3(\u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 e + e \u2212 , m e + e \u2212 > 5 GeV) = N \u03b3\u03b3,data \u2212 N \u03b3\u03b3,bkg C \u03b3\u03b3 \u00d7 C e + e \u2212 \u00d7 Acc e + e \u2212 N e + e \u2212 ,data \u00d7 P ,",

Fourteen LbL scattering candidate-events with just two photons produced have been observed passing all kinematical selection requirements: single-photon E \u03b3 T > 2 GeV, pseudorapidity |\u03b7 \u03b3 | < 2.4; and diphoton invariant mass m \u03b3\u03b3 > 5 GeV, transverse momentum p \u03b3\u03b3 T < 1 GeV, and acoplanarity (1 \u2212 \u0394\u03c6 \u03b3\u03b3 /\u03c0) < 0.01. Both the measured total yields and kinematic distributions are in accord with the expectations from the LbL scattering signal plus small residual backgrounds, mostly from misidentified exclusive dielectron, \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 e + e \u2212 , and gluon-induced central exclusive, gg \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3, processes. The observed (expected) significance of the LbL scattering signal over the background-only expectation is 4.1 (4.4) standard deviations. The measured fiducial light-by-light scattering cross section, \u03c3 fid (\u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3) = 122 \u00b1 46 (stat) \u00b1 29 (syst) \u00b1 4 (theo) nb, is consistent with the standard model prediction.",
