The measurement was performed on a liquid-hydrogen target using a 5.75 GeV electron beam. The complete five-fold differential cross sections were measured over a wide kinematic range including the complete range of azimuthal angles between hadronic and leptonic planes, , enabling us to separate the -dependent terms. Our measurements of the -independent term of the cross section at low Bjorken x were found to be in fairly good agreement with pQCD calculations. Indeed, the conventional current fragmentation calculation can account for almost all of the observed cross section, even at small \u00fe momentum. The measured center-of-momentum spectra are in qualitative agreement with highenergy data, which suggests a surprising numerical similarity between the spectator diquark fragmentation in the present reaction and the antiquark fragmentation measured in e \u00fe e \u00c0 collisions. We have observed that the two -dependent terms of the cross section are small. Within our precision the cos2 term is compatible with zero, except for the low-z region, and the measured cos term is much smaller in magnitude than the sum of the Cahn and Berger effects.",

In the deep inelastic scattering (DIS) regime the semi-inclusive leptoproduction of hadrons can be described by perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD) combining nonperturbative distribution/fragmentation functions. Semiinclusive leptoproduction of hadrons in DIS (SIDIS) can occur through current or target fragmentation [1] (see Fig. 1). Current fragmentation is the hadronization of the struck quark, while target fragmentation is hadronization of the spectator. Both nonperturbative, soft fragmentation mechanisms factorize from the hard virtual-photon/parton scattering amplitude in pQCD (see Ref. [2] for the current fragmentation and Refs. [3,4] for the target fragmentation).",

The leptoproduction of hadrons in the current fragmentation region combines these two and provides additional information about hadronization and nucleon structure. In fact, for DIS, semi-inclusive measurements provide new information about the transverse momentum distribution (TMD) of partons, which is important for understanding the role of orbital angular momenta of quarks and gluons [5]. Furthermore, the detection of a hadron in SIDIS introduces a flavor selectivity for the observed parton distributions. In contrast, target fragmentation is described by fracture functions, present only in the semi-inclusive reactions.",

Measurements of unpolarized semi-inclusive leptonnucleon scattering have been performed at several facilities such as CERN (EMC [6]), Fermilab (E655 [7]), DESY (H1 [8], ZEUS [9], HERMES [10]), SLAC [11], Cornell [12][13][14] and Jefferson Lab (Hall C) [15,16]. The last two experiments covered a kinematical region similar to the present measurement. Despite all of these measurements, open questions remain about the target fragmentation mechanism and the physics behind the azimuthal distributions. The measurements at high beam energies (EMC, E655, H1 and ZEUS) covered a broad kinematic range, but lacked particle identification and the statistics to look at differential cross sections in more than two kinematic variables (the latter applies also to HERMES). Experiments at lower energies (SLAC, Cornell and Hall C of Jefferson Lab) using classical spectrometers measured cross sections only at a few kinematic points. To improve the current knowledge of semi-inclusive lepton-nucleon scattering one has to combine the broad coverage of high-energy experiments with high luminosity and particle identification in order to measure the fully differential cross section for a specified hadron.",

The average luminosity was 10 34 cm \u00c02 s \u00c01 . CLAS is based on a six-sector torus magnet with its field pointing azimuthally around the beam direction. The torus polarity was set to bend negatively charged particles toward the beam line. The sectors delimited by the magnet coils are individually instrumented to form six independent magnetic spectrometers. The particle detection system includes drift chambers (DC) for track reconstruction [45], scintillation counters (SC) for time-of-flight measurements [46], Cherenkov counters (CC) for electron identification [47], and electromagnetic calorimeters (EC) for electron-pion separation [48]. The CLAS can detect and identify charged particles with momenta down to 0:2 GeV=c for polar angles between 8 and 142 , while the electron-pion separation is limited up to about 50 by the CC acceptance. The total angular acceptance for electrons is about 1.5 sr.

At low hadron momenta the TOF system is able to distinguish pions from kaons, but above jp h j % 1:2 GeV=c the peaks of the two particles begin to mix. However, large hadron momenta make two-kaon production less likely due to the correspondingly high-energy threshold, and therefore most of the background comes from single kaons associated with \u00c3 and AE 0 production. In order to suppress the kaon contamination we applied two cuts: a kinematical cut that removes \u00c3, AE 0 and \u00c3 \u00c3 \u00f01520\u00de, and a TOF cut M 2 h < m 2 \u00fe 2 M 2 \u00f0TOF\u00de that suppresses low-momentum kaons. The mass resolution of the TOF system was determined by fitting the width of the pion peak, which yielded M 2 \u00f0TOF\u00de \u00bc 0:022jp h j\u00c2 exp\u00f00: 6 ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi ffi jp h j p \u00de, where p h is given in GeV=c and M 2 \u00f0TOF\u00de in \u00f0GeV=c 2 \u00de 2 . Corrections for the remaining kaons from semi-inclusive production above the two-kaon threshold were made using the ratio of K \u00fe to \u00fe semi-inclusive cross sections obtained from a pQCD-based Monte Carlo (MC) event generator (see the following section), weighted with the kaon/pion rejection factor obtained from the simulation itself. Kaons from the MC were propagated through the entire chain of the reconstruction procedure exactly in the same way as was done for pions, and the fraction f\u00f0K \u00fe \u00de of kaons reconstructed as pions was obtained. This number was normalized to the fraction f\u00f0 \u00fe \u00de of simulated pions reconstructed by the procedure. This kaon/pion rejection factor was parametrized as a function of the hadron momentum. The contribution from the K \u00fe background varied from 0 to 20% with an average of 1%, and our procedure reduced the kaons by a factor of 2 at 2:3 GeV=c with an increasing reduction factor at lower hadron momenta.",

The total charge collected on the empty target is an order of magnitude smaller than the one for the full target data. In order to increase the statistics of the empty target distributions, we made the assumption that the ratio of full to empty target event rates factorizes as a function of all variables. Thus one can obtain the ratio of empty to full target rates (ranging from 0 to 18% with an average value of 4.7%) for the five-fold differential cross section as a product of one-fold differential ratios. The contribution of empty target is typically smaller than the total systematic uncertainty, reaching its maximum at the two pion threshold.",

These next-to-leading order (NLO) calculations include a systematic uncertainty due to arbitrary factorization/renormalization scale variations [62], indicating the size of possible higher-order effects. This was evaluated by variation of each scale by a factor of 2 in both directions and the obtained differences for all  scales were summed in quadrature. NLO calculations within their uncertainty lie closer to the data in the low-z region than leading-order ones. The difference between the data and NLO pQCD is at most about 20%. At low x and z < 0:4 the data are higher than NLO calculations, while at largest x both the LO and NLO calculations lie above the data. The multiplicity ratio H 2 =F 2 shown in Fig. 21 demonstrates the same level of agreement between data and pQCD calculations as H 2 alone.

In analogy with vector meson photoproduction measurements, a contribution from target fragmentation may come from u-channel exchange [67] by a particle or a set of particles (see Fig. 22). In this case the cross section would be proportional to the structure function of the exchanged particle (e.g. a neutron) or set of particles [68]. In this case one would expect a peak at jtj \u00bc jtj max , in addition to the dominant peak at jtj \u00bc jtj min due to Regge exchange in the t-channel. This u-channel production can be called the ''leading-particle'' contribution in the target fragmentation region because the produced hadron carries almost all of the spectator momentum. However, the measured t-distribution shown in Fig. 23  evidence of the second peak at jtj \u00bc jtj max . In Fig. 23 the solid line shows an expected u-channel exchange contribution assumed to be 1% of the t-channel term. As one can see this assumption is not supported by the data. This observation is in agreement with a known phenomenological rule that a particle not present in the initial state cannot be the leading particle in a target jet [69].",

Such behavior is in good agreement with that observed in semiinclusive \u00fe production by a muon beam at much higher energies [70].

The theory describes approximately the x F > 0 behavior beginning from the x F $ 0 peak. At negative x F values the theoretical curve is almost constant and deviates strongly from the data.

By simply using the fragmentation function D\u00f0z G \u00de in Eq. (29) for both forward and backward regions, one obtains a qualitative agreement between theoretical and experimental x F distributions (see Fig. 25). Hence the target fragmentation term in Eq.

It is also related to the dominance of the favored u-quark fragmentation in \u00fe , since the two valence u-quarks in the proton are likely to be evenly distributed between current and target fragments.

These predictions are generally in agreement with our data. The data points at large p T and low z lie above the theoretical curves, this difference reaches 2-3 systematic deviations.   Tables IX and  X. We notice that the use of the weighted average technique is not strictly justified over the entire range of z and p T . In some points, in particular, in the low-z region, the data show a clear x and/or Q 2 -dependence leading to an underestimation of the averaged statistical uncertainties. Although, the full uncertainty on the averaged data is in any case dominated by the systematic uncertainty. Not averaged data obtained from the two methods are statistically compatible. The comparison with higher energy data from Ref. [72] shown in Fig. 30 reveals the striking difference between the two measurements of H 3 , whereas both measurements of H 4 at large and small Q 2 are compatible with zero. At large Q 2 the absolute values of the ratio H 3 =H 2 reach 0.05-0.1 and seem to follow the expected 1=Q 2 behavior. However, our data at lower Q 2 do not follow this trend having values compatible with zero. The strong suppression of H 3 at Q 2 ' 2 \u00f0GeV=c\u00de 2 with respect to the data at Q 2 ' 30-60 \u00f0GeV=c\u00de 2 does not seem to be related to the threshold effect due to the phase space shrinkage at lower energies discussed in Ref. [73]. To account for it, the ratios of the Gaussian model integrals over the allowed kinematical region:",

(iii) The comparison of the measured structure function H 2 to the current fragmentation LO and NLO pQCD calculations shows that the difference between the data and calculations reaches 20% at the low-x limit of the z < 0:4 region, which is compatible with systematic uncertainties in the calculations due to higher-order corrections and the favored fragmentation assumption. (iv) The separation of the current and soft target fragmentation processes in the CM frame shows a sym- metry about x F \u00bc 0, which suggests the presence of an intriguing numerical equality between the fragmentation of the spectator diquark in the target region of SIDIS and the fragmentation of the antiquark in e \u00fe e \u00c0 collisions. (v) The precision of the data does not allow us to obtain information about the contribution of the Boer-Mulders function, which is expected to be smaller than our estimated systematic uncertainties [34,74]. (vi) The H 4 structure function is compatible with zero within our precision, except for the low-z region where it is positive. The H 3 structure function appears to be somewhat better determined than H 4 and is in strong disagreement with the predictions of the Cahn effect. Inclusion of the Berger effect does not change significantly the disagreement in H 3 .",
