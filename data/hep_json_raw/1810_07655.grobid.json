The \u03a5 (nS) mesons are reconstructed through their decays into two opposite-sign muons. The measurements comprise the differential production cross-sections of the \u03a5 (1S) and \u03a5 (2S) states, their forward-to-backward ratios and nuclear modification factors. The measurements are performed as a function of the transverse momentum p T and rapidity in the nucleon-nucleon centre-of-mass frame y * of the \u03a5 (nS) states, in the kinematic range p T < 25 GeV/c and 1.5 < y * < 4.0 (\u22125.0 < y * < \u22122.5) for pPb (Pbp) collisions. In addition, production cross-sections for \u03a5 (3S) are measured integrated over phase space and the production ratios between all three \u03a5 (nS) states are determined. Suppression for bottomonium in proton-lead collisions is observed, which is particularly visible in the ratios. The results are compared to theoretical models.",

            "text": "Existing experimental results in collisions of ultra-relativistic heavy nuclei are consistent with the formation of a deconfined state of hot partonic matter, referred to as Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) [1,2]. One of the signatures of QGP is the suppression of heavy-quarkonia production in the collisions of heavy nuclei (AA collisions) with respect to pp collisions, an effect that is enhanced for states with lower binding energies, such as the \u03a5 (3S) meson [3]. However, the suppression of heavy-quarkonia production can also occur in the collisions of protons with heavy nuclei (pA collisions), where traditionally it was assumed that there was no QGP created.",

            "text": "In pA collisions, this suppression is caused by nuclear phenomena unrelated to deconfinement, commonly called cold nuclear matter (CNM) effects. The CNM effects that are expected to affect quarkonia production are of two types, \"initial-state\" effects happening at a early stage of the collision, such as nuclear effects on parton densities [4][5][6][7] or coherent energy losses [8][9][10], and \"final-state\" effects, as quarkonia absorption by nucleons [11], expected to be negligible at LHC energies [12][13][14][15]. Another final-state effect is the breaking of the qq pair caused by collisions with comoving particles with similar rapidities (the so-called \"comovers\" model [16][17][18][19][20]), whose density is determined from the particle multiplicity measured in that region of rapidity. This model could explain the relative suppression observed among the \u03a5 (nS) states both in AA [21] and in pA collisions [22]. The size of nuclear effects can be quantified by measuring the nuclear modification factor R pA , which is defined as the ratio of the cross-section in pA collisions to that in pp collisions scaled by the number of nucleons in the nucleus. In the absence of modifications, R pA is unity.",

Using a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of about 1.5 nb \u22121 , the LHCb collaboration measured the production of \u03a5 (nS) mesons in pPb collisions at a per-nucleon centre-of-mass energy of \u221a s NN = 5 TeV [28]. Moreover, the measurement of nuclear modification and forwardbackward production ratios for \u03a5 (1S), as well as \u03a5 (nS) to \u03a5 (1S) ratios, were performed. In this paper, the production of \u03a5 (nS) mesons is studied in pPb collisions using data collected at \u221a s NN = 8. 16 TeV with the LHCb detector, corresponding to a total integrated luminosity of 31.8 nb \u22121 . This dataset has been used already for the study of the production of prompt J/\u03c8 and J/\u03c8 coming from b-hadron decays (called nonprompt J/\u03c8 in the following) [29]. The measurements presented in this work comprise the differential production cross-sections of the \u03a5 (1S) and \u03a5 (2S) states, their forward-to-backward ratios and nuclear modification factors, and the production ratios between all three \u03a5 (nS) states. In addition, the ratio of \u03a5 (1S) to nonprompt J/\u03c8 cross-sections is determined as a function of proton-nucleon centre-of-mass rapidity, y * , integrated over the transverse momenta, p T , of the mesons, a measurement that allows direct comparison of open heavy-flavour and quarkonia production in the environment of heavy-nuclei collisions.",

Photons, electrons and hadrons are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter and a hadronic calorimeter. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers [35]. The trigger [36] consists of a hardware stage, based on information from the calorimeter and muon systems, followed by a software stage, in which all charged particles with p T > 300 MeV/c are reconstructed. The alignment and calibration of the detector is performed in near real-time [37]. This alignment is also used later in the offline reconstruction, ensuring consistent and high-quality particle identification (PID) information in the online and offline processing. The identical performance of the online and offline reconstruction offers the opportunity to perform physics analyses directly using candidates reconstructed in the trigger [36,38] as well as storing information about all reconstructed particles in the event [39]. The storage of only the triggered candidates enables a reduction of the event size by an order of magnitude.",

The energy of the proton beam is 6.5 TeV, while that of the lead beam is 2.56 TeV per nucleon, resulting in a centre-of-mass energy of the proton-nucleon system of 8.16 TeV . Since the energy per nucleon in the proton beam is significantly larger than that in the lead beam, the proton-nucleon centre-of-mass system has a rapidity in the laboratory frame of +0.465 (\u22120.465) for pPb (Pbp) collisions, resulting in a shift of the effective detector acceptance. In this analysis, \u03a5 (nS) mesons are measured in the kinematic range of p T < 25 GeV/c, and 1.5 < y * < 4.0 for pPb forward and \u22125.0 < y * < \u22122.5 for pPb backward collisions. This is the first measurement of \u03a5 (3S) production in pPb collisions in this kinematic range. The data samples correspond to an integrated luminosity of 12.5 \u00b1 0.3 nb \u22121 in the forward configuration and 19.3 \u00b1 0.5 nb \u22121 in the backward JHEP11(2018)194 configuration.

The difference in efficiencies as a function of rapidity is largely due to acceptance effects. 6 Systematic uncertainties Table 2 summarises the systematic uncertainties, which are different for each of the \u03a5 (nS) states. The finite size of the simulation samples leads to an uncertainty on the efficiency estimation, which is uncorrelated among bins and \u03a5 (nS) states and contributes to the uncertainties in acceptance, offline selection and trigger efficiencies. These uncertainties are small compared to the other systematic uncertainties and barely affect the overall systematic uncertainty. All other uncertainties are correlated among bins. The choice of the fit model for the mass distributions affects the signal yields. The uncertainty associated with the choice of the fit functions is estimated using different functions (single Crystal Ball functions for signal, and a second-order polynomial for background), and by modifying the fit range for the signal fit to account for the uncertainty due to the radiative tail. The uncertainty due to the choice of the fit models is estimated to be 5.7%.",

The measurements and the calculations are shown in figures 6 and 7. For the \u03a5 (1S) state the nuclear modification factor is about 0.5 (0.8) at low p T in the forward (backward) region, and is consistent with unity for p T larger than 10 GeV/c, as predicted by the models. As a function of rapidity, R pPb is consistent with unity in the Pbp region at negative |y * |, while a suppression is observed in the pPb region, where it averages around 0.7, consistent with the models analysed. The nuclear modification factor for \u03a5 (2S) is smaller than \u03a5 (1S), which is consistent with the comovers models. The corresponding numerical results can be found in appendix C. The same trend as for the \u03a5 (1S) state is observed for the \u03a5 (2S)state, although the suppression seems more pronounced for the \u03a5 (2S) state, as already observed by other experiments [22], especially in the backward region.",

The cross-sections, nuclear modification factors and forward-backward ratios are measured double-differentially (\u03a5 (1S)) and single-differentially (\u03a5 (2S)). The ratios of the production cross-sections of the different \u03a5 (nS) states are also measured as functions of transverse momentum and rapidity in the nucleon-nucleon centre-of-mass frame. The results are consistent with previous observations and with the theoretical model calculations, indicating a suppression of \u03a5 (nS) production in proton-lead collisions up to about 40%, more pronounced for the excited \u03a5 states, particularly in the region of negative rapidity.",
