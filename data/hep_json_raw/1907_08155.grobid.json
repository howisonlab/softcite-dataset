At leading order in pQCD, direct photons are produced mainly through quark-gluon scattering (qg \u2192 q\u03b3) with smaller contributions from quark antiquark annihilation (qq \u2192 g\u03b3). Photons can also be produced via fragmentation of the final state partons. These latter photons are typically accompanied by other partons, and their contributions can be experimentally suppressed by requiring the photons to be isolated from other energy depositions in the calorimeters. A good understanding of isolated photon production also indirectly impacts all jet measurements at the LHC, because photon+jet events are commonly used to determine the absolute jet energy-scale. This process also constitutes a main background in important standard model (SM) processes, such as H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3, as well as in searches for physics beyond the SM.",

The identification and energy measurement of muons, electrons, photons, hadronic jets as well as the missing transverse momentum come from particle-flow objects. In addition, the isolations of identified leptons and photons are measured using the p T of particle-flow charged hadrons, photons, and neutral hadrons. Jets are reconstructed using the anti-k T algorithm with a distance parameter of \u0394R = 0.5 [14], where R determines the size of the jet in \u03b7-\u03c6 space and \u03c6 is measured in radians. Corrections are applied to the jet energy as functions of jet \u03b7 and p T to account for contributions from additional inelastic proton-proton interactions in the same or neighboring bunch crossings (pileup), and for the nonuniform and nonlinear response of the detectors [15]. Jets are further required to have at least minimal energy depositions in the tracker, HCAL, and ECAL to reject spurious jets associated with calorimeter noise as well as those associated with muon and electron candidates that are either mis-reconstructed or isolated [16]. Jets have typical energy resolutions of 15-20% at 30 GeV, 10% at 100 GeV, and 5% at 1 TeV [13].",

This threshold is p T > 20 or 22 GeV, and is raised to 30 GeV at high luminosity to keep trigger rates at manageable levels. The CMS high-level trigger (HLT) applies a more complicated ECAL energy clustering algorithm than that of level-1, and requires additional p T trigger thresholds ranging from 30 to 150 GeV. HLT triggers with thresholds below 90 GeV have additional loose calorimetric identification requirements, based on the electromagnetic (EM) shower, and are prescaled such that only a fraction of events satisfying the trigger requirements are recorded. Since the trigger rates for lower p T threshold triggers are controlled by applying larger prescale factors, the effective luminosity is smaller for the lower p T regions.

There-  fore, dijet events where a photon is radiated in a parton shower are included. The dominant background originates from the decays of neutral hadrons, such as \u03c0 0 and \u03b7 mesons, into photon pairs with small angular separation. To separate signal photons from this background, photons are selected by requiring a narrow transverse shower shape in the ECAL (in the \u03b7 coordinate), no matching reconstructed track candidates (except for electron tracks from photon conversion), and minimal energy measured in the HCAL region matched to the ECAL shower. Photon candidates are further required to be isolated from nearby particle-flow candidates, such as charged hadrons and photons, after removing those consistent with pileup [17]. A photon candidate is defined as isolated from charged hadrons Bias corrected Purity",

The statistical (systematic) uncertainties are shown as error bars (color bands) if the sum of the p T of the charged hadron particle-flow candidates in a cone of radius \u0394R < 0.3 around its direction is less than 5 GeV. To limit correlations of the selected photon candidate's shower energy with other photon quantities, an area in the vicinity of the photon candidate is eliminated in the calculation of the photon isolation (calculated simi-larly to charged hadron isolation but from the p T sum of the photon particle-flow candidates), leading to smaller correlation overall. Because of the pileup subtraction, the final photon isolation may be negative as calculated. Final photon candidates are required to have less than 0.0 GeV for |\u03b7| < 1.44, \u22120.5 GeV for 1.5 < |\u03b7| < 2.1, and \u22121.0 GeV for 2.1 < |\u03b7| < 2.5. Several quantities related to the shape of the EM shower are then used in a boosted-decision-tree (BDT) [25] to discriminate between direct photons and photons from hadronic activity. These quantities include the transverse width of the cluster in the \u03b7 and \u03c6 coordinates in the ECAL, the calorimetry-based likelihood of this shower to come from a conversion, the pseudorapidity of the cluster, and the average pileup energy density of the event. Simulated samples of photons originating from photon+jet events, where the reconstructed photons are matched to the generated photon, are used as training samples for the signal. Samples of sim- ulated QCD multijet events selected at generation level as containing electromagnetically decaying final particles are used for background training. The background contribution from electrons misidentified as photons is determined from simulation, using W \u2192 e\u03bd sample, and found to be many orders of magnitude smaller than the QCD multijet background. Therefore, this background is not considered in the BDT training. The output from this BDT is then used to statistically quantify the fraction of true photons in the candidate sample.",

Using a mixture of simulated events containing both dijets and pho-ton+jets, a range of isolation windows are examined. For T , a range of sideband windows are used to generate background templates by varying the candidate photon isolation constraint to an upper bound determined by data set size (nominally 4.5-5 GeV). Based on the observed data sample size, template shapes are generated randomly from the simulated shapes and then are used to perform a fit to a separate mixture of simulation with a known signal fraction. Based on these generated shapes, the bias between the known signal fraction and the signal fraction from the fit is determined using 500 trials, and the central value of this distribution is taken as the bias induced by the residual correlations.

The uncertainty in this measured purity is estimated from sample distributions generated by varying the signal and background fit templates within their respective uncertainties. For the signal template, where the uncertainty contribution is from differences between simulation and detector response, the shapes of sample distributions are obtained by simultaneous variations across different bins of the BDT template.

Therefore, the sample distributions for the background template are created by allowing the adjacent bins to vary independently of each other.

            "text": "Measurements of the triple-differential inclusive isolated-photon+jet cross section were performed as a function of photon transverse momentum ( p \u03b3 T ), photon pseudorapidity (\u03b7 \u03b3 ), and jet pseudorapidity (\u03b7 jet ). The measurements were carried out in pp collision at \u221a s = 8 TeV using 19.7 fb \u22121 of data collected by the CMS detector covering a kinematic range of |\u03b7 \u03b3 | < 1.44 and 1.57 < |\u03b7 \u03b3 | < 2.50, |\u03b7 jet | < 2.5, 40 < p \u03b3 T < 1000 GeV, and jet transverse momentum, p jet T , >25 GeV. The photon purity was estimated using a combination of templates from data and simulation, based on a multivariate technique. The measured cross sections are in good agreement with the next-to-leading order perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD) prediction, and the experimental uncertainties are comparable or smaller than the theoretical ones. These measured cross sections, in different combinations of photon and jet pseudorapidities, probe pQCD over a wide range of parton momentum fractions. Inclusion of such gluon-sensitive data into the global parton distribution function (PDF) fit analyses has the potential to constrain the gluon PDFs, particularly in the regions where the measured uncertainties are smaller than the uncertainty bands of theoretical predictions. accelerator departments for the excellent performance of the LHC and thank the technical and administrative staffs at CERN and at other CMS institutes for their contributions to the success of the CMS effort.
