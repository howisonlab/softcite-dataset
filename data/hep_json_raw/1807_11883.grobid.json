No significant excess is found and limits are set on vector-like quark, fourtop-quark, and same-sign top-quark pair production. The observed (expected) 95% CL mass limits for a vector-like T -and B-quark singlet are m T > 0.98 (0.99) TeV and m B > 1.00 (1.01) TeV respectively. Limits on the production of the vector-like T 5/3 -quark are also derived considering both pair and single production; in the former case the lower limit on the mass of the T 5/3 -quark is (expected to be) 1.19 (1.21) TeV. The Standard Model fourtop-quark production cross-section upper limit is (expected to be) 69 (29) fb. Constraints are also set on exotic four-top-quark production models. Finally, limits are set on samesign top-quark pair production. The upper limit on uu \u2192 tt production is (expected to be) 89 (59) fb for a mediator mass of 1 TeV, and a dark-matter interpretation is also derived, excluding a mediator of 3 TeV with a dark-sector coupling of 1.0 and a coupling to ordinary matter above 0.31.",

            "text": "One of the primary goals of the ATLAS experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is to search for physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM). The existence of dark matter, the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the universe, and the high degree of fine tuning required to stabilise the Higgs boson mass at 125 GeV are among the motivations for the existence of BSM physics. In this analysis, events with two leptons of the same electric charge or three leptons and at least one jet identified as originating from a bhadron are considered. This is a promising final state to search for new phenomena, since the backgrounds from known processes are small. In addition to the lepton requirements, kinematic criteria are imposed to select events containing objects with large transverse momenta to further suppress the background. After applying these criteria, the largest background sources are ttW , ttZ, ttH, and diboson production. There is also substantial",

Three potential BSM sources of events in this final state are considered: production of vector-like quarks (VLQ), anomalous four-top-quark production (tttt), and same-sign top-quark pair production (tt). Four-top-quark production in the context of the Standard Model (SM) is also studied, since this process has not yet been observed. Throughout this paper, 'lepton' is taken to mean electron or muon and is denoted by in formulae and tables, and a particular set of electrons and muons in the final state is referred to as a 'lepton flavour combination'.",

An earlier ATLAS analysis using this signature at \u221a s = 8 TeV [1] placed limits on the models considered in this paper, including m B > 0.62 TeV and m T > 0.59 TeV in the context of the singlet model of ref. [2], where B and T indicate the VLQ with the same charges as the SM b-and t-quarks, respectively. That analysis also placed an upper limit of 70 fb on the cross-section of fourtop-quark production with SM kinematics. Limits on same-sign top-quark pair production were also set; in the context of a flavour-changing neutral current (FCNC) model with a mediator similar to a Higgs boson of mass 125 GeV the cross-section for uu \u2192 tt was found to be < 35 fb. In addition, there have been prior searches for BSM effects in similar final states at \u221a s = 13 TeV: ref. [3] reports an ATLAS search in the context of supersymmetric (SUSY) models, and ref. [4] reports a search by the CMS Collaboration where SUSY models and other BSM models are considered. The CMS Collaboration performed searches for pair production of the vector-like T 5/3 quark, which has charge 5/3, using events with either a single lepton or a same-charge lepton pair [5], resulting in limits of m T 5/3 > 1.02 TeV (0.99 TeV) for right-handed (left-handed) couplings. The CMS Collaboration reported on a search for SM four-top-quark production in ref. [6], resulting in a measured cross-section of 16.9 +13.8 \u221211.4 fb and a limit on the Yukawa coupling between the top quark and the Higgs boson of less than 2.1 times its expected SM value.",

The luminosity and its uncertainty are derived, following a methodology similar to that detailed in ref. [32], from a calibration of the luminosity scale using x-y beam-separation scans. In this dataset the average number of simultaneous pp interactions per bunch crossing in addition to the triggered hard-scatter interaction, pile-up, was approximately 24. Data-quality requirements were applied to ensure that events were selected only from periods where all subdetectors were operating at nominal conditions, and where the LHC beams were in stable-collision mode. The events used in the analysis were required to have at least one primary vertex formed from at least two charged-particle tracks with transverse momentum p T > 0.4 GeV, and to have been triggered either by two leptons or a single high-p T lepton. Only triggers with loose lepton quality and isolation requirements were used, since tight requirements at the trigger level would complicate the estimation of the background originating from fake or non-prompt leptons. The dilepton triggers provide sensitivity at low lepton p T values, and the single-lepton triggers provide additional efficiency for high-p T leptons. The p T thresholds for the dilepton triggers varied from 8 to 24 GeV depending on the lepton flavours and the year in which the event was recorded. The single-muon trigger had a p T threshold of 50 GeV; the corresponding single-electron trigger had a p T threshold of 24 GeV for data recorded in 2015 and 60 GeV for data recorded in 2016. The trigger efficiency depends on the lepton flavour combination, but in all cases is > 95% for events of interest in this analysis.  Table 1. Summary of object identification and definition. 'ID quality' refers to the identification criteria used for each object type. For electrons, 'mediumLH' and 'tightLH' refer to the likelihood medium and tight requirements defined in ref. [33]; for muons the criteria for 'medium' ID quality are defined in ref. [34]. For jets, 'cleaning' means applying a procedure to reduce contamination from spurious jets [36], and 'JVT' means applying criteria to select jets that are consistent with being produced at the primary vertex rather than from pile-up [37]. For b-jets, 'MVA77' refers to placing a requirement on the multivariate discriminant defined in ref. [38] that is 77% efficient for b-jets in simulated tt events.",

An operating point is defined by a threshold in the range of discriminant output values, and is chosen to provide specific b-, c-, and light-jet efficiencies in simulated tt events.

There are two primary mechanisms by which the electron charge can be misidentified: the first is the 'trident' process in which an electron emits an energetic bremsstrahlung photon, which subsequently produces an e + e \u2212 pair. This can result in a track of the incorrect charge being associated with the electron. The second is the mismeasurement of the curvature of the electron track. The probability for an electron to have its charge incorrectly reconstructed is measured using a sample of dielectron events with invariant mass consistent with the Z boson. The trident process can result in misidentified charge for an electron that is also likely to be considered fake/non-prompt due to the presence of nearby charged tracks. To avoid double-counting the background contribution from such electrons, the matrix method is used to subtract the fake/non-prompt electron yield from the Z sample. The charge misidentification probability is calculated in bins of electron |\u03b7| and p T , using a likelihood fit that adjusts these binned probabilities to find the best agreement with the observed numbers of same-charge and opposite-charge electron pairs. The charge misidentification probability varies from 2 \u00d7 10 \u22125 (for electrons at low p T and small |\u03b7|) to 10 \u22122 for electrons at high p T and |\u03b7| near the edge of the barrel calorimeter; for electrons with larger values of |\u03b7| the probability can reach 10%.",

The first uncertainty is estimated by modifying the selection criteria for the control samples. The modified sample for measuring r for electrons requires E miss T > 175 GeV, the modified sample for measuring f for electrons requires E miss T < 20 GeV, the modified sample for measuring r for muons requires m T (W ) > 110 GeV, and the modified sample for measuring f for muons requires E miss T < 20 GeV and E miss T + m T (W ) < 60 GeV. The second uncertainty is estimated by dividing the control samples randomly into four subsamples, computing the efficiencies in each of them, and observing the variation in the fake/non-prompt lepton yield. This variation is then divided by two since each of the subsamples has only one fourth of the statistics of the full sample. This procedure accounts for any correlations in the efficiencies. The third uncertainty is estimated by varying the normalisation of the MC subtraction in the fake control sample by 10%. The resulting uncertainty depends on the region the fake/non-prompt lepton background is estimated in, since the fake sample can vary kinematically, but is generally around 40-50% of the expected fake/non-prompt lepton yield for the dominant uncertainty in the signal regions.

There are no statistically significant differences between the event yields and the expected background, although in two of the signal regions, SR3b2 L and SR3b3 L, the event yield exceeds the background by 1.7 and 1.8 standard deviations, respectively. The resulting combined significance depends on the signal being considered, reaching 3.0 standard deviations for SM four-top-quark production (where this contribution is not included among the backgrounds), while a significance of 0.9 standard deviations is expected. More than half of the excess is observed in events with two muons, three btagged jets and H T around 700 GeV. The largest significance for any of the BSM models  considered is 2.3 standard deviations, which is obtained for the 2HDM model. Therefore no evidence of BSM signals is found, and limits are set as detailed below. Several studies were done to validate the background estimate. One potential issue was noted when applying the matrix method for muons to the same sample of events used to calculate the fake/non-prompt muon efficiency, where the predicted yield was observed to deviate from data at the level of 1.2 standard deviations near \u2206R(\u00b5, jet) = 1.0. Applying a two-dimensional parameterisation of the efficiencies in p T,\u00b5 \u00d7 \u2206R(\u00b5, jet) substantially improves the level of agreement, and the background in the signal regions was recomputed with this parameterisation. In addition, the prompt-and fake-lepton efficiencies used in the estimation of the fake/non-prompt lepton background were recomputed using different requirements for the number of b-tagged jets in the control regions (this test is especially important for electrons, where the fraction of candidates arising from photon conversion versus heavy-flavour decay varies strongly with the presence or absence of a b-tagged jet), and also using a completely different set of control regions (dilepton events where a tag-andprobe procedure was applied). The fake/non-prompt lepton background was also estimated using the fake-factor method [61] instead of the matrix method.

The resulting 95% CL upper limits on the production cross-section as a function of the VLQ mass are shown in figure 8. Lower limits on the B-and T -quark masses are extracted from these crosssection limits, resulting in observed (expected) excluded mass m B < 1.00 TeV (1.01 TeV) and m T < 0.98 TeV (0.99 TeV). The expected and observed limits agree well in spite of the observed excesses in some signal regions because the expected yield of VLQ in those regions is small. In the second scenario, no assumptions are made about the branching ratio, and  Figure 8.

Several BSM processes are considered that could enhance the yield of such events over the small expected background. The search is performed in the context of BSM models, with signal regions defined for different models. No significant excess over the expected background is observed.  95% confidence level.
