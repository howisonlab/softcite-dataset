Using 454.3 fb \u22121 of data collected around a center-of-mass energy of \u221a s = 10.58 GeV by the BABAR experiment at SLAC, approximately 150 000 signal events are obtained. The corresponding non-radiative cross section is measured with a relative uncertainty of 3.6 % in the energy region around 1.5 GeV, surpassing all existing measurements in precision. Using this new result, the channel's contribution to the leading order hadronic vacuum polarization contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon is calculated as (g \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 2\u03c0 0 \u00b5 \u2212 2)/2 = (17.9 \u00b1 0.1stat \u00b1 0.6syst) \u00d7 10 \u221210 in the energy range 0.85 GeV < ECM < 1.8 GeV. In the same energy range, the impact on the running of the fine structure constant at the Z 0 -pole is determined as \u2206\u03b1 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 2\u03c0 0 (M 2 Z ) = (4.44 \u00b1 0.02stat \u00b1 0.14syst) \u00d7 10 \u22124 . Furthermore, intermediate resonances are studied and especially the cross section of the process e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c9\u03c0 0 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 2\u03c0 0 is measured.",

            "text": "The anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, g \u00b5 \u2212 2, exhibits a discrepancy of more than three standard deviations [1] between experiment and theory, making it one of the most interesting puzzles in contemporary particle physics. New experiments to improve the measurement of g \u00b5 \u2212 2 are starting operation at Fermilab [2] and J-PARC [3]. On the theoretical side [4], the QED and weak contributions account for the largest contribution to g \u00b5 \u2212 2 and have been calculated with precision significantly exceeding the experiment. The theoretical prediction is limited by the hadronic contributions, which cannot be calculated perturbatively at low energies. Therefore, measured cross sections are used in combination with the optical theorem to compute the hadronic part of g \u00b5 \u2212 2. This leads to the dominant uncertainty in the standard model prediction of g \u00b5 \u2212 2, which is comparable to the experimental precision. Hence, in order to improve the theoretical prediction, accurate measurements of all hadronic final states are needed. In this paper, we present a new measurement of one of the least known cross sections, e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 2\u03c0 0 . This measurement supersedes a preliminary analysis [5] from BABAR on the same final state. The earlier measurement was performed on approximately half of the BABAR data set. Additionally, the new analysis improves the systematic uncertainties of the detection efficiency and of the background subtraction.",

Events where the photon is emitted as final-state radiation (FSR) can be neglected since their produced number is extremely low and the FSR photon rarely is sufficiently energetic.

In this analysis, the full data set around the \u03a5 (4S) is used, amounting to an integrated luminosity of 454.3 fb \u22121 [10]. The BABAR detector is described in detail elsewhere [11,12]. The innermost part of the detector is a silicon vertex tracker (SVT), surrounded by the Drift Chamber (DCH), both operating in a 1.5 T magnetic field. Together, the SVT and DCH provide tracking information for charged particles. Neutral particles and electrons are detected in the electromagnetic calorimeter (EMC), which also measures their energy. Particle identification (PID) is provided by the information from the EMC, SVT, and DCH combined with measurements from the internally reflecting ring-imaging Cherenkov detector (DIRC).

In order to subtract this contribution, a simulation based on the JETSET generator [17] is used after modifications discussed below to make it more precise.

As the remaining continuum MC-sample does not contain ISR events, a photon from a \u03c0 0 decay must be misidentified as an ISR photon for the event to pass the selection criteria. Since the relative fraction of low-multiplicity events in the continuum simulation is rather unreliable, the continuum sample is normalized by comparing the \u03c0 0 peak in the invariant \u03b3 ISR \u03b3 mass to data (considering all \u03b3 ISR \u03b3 combinations, where \u03b3 ISR is the selected ISR photon and \u03b3 corresponds to any photon not already assigned to a \u03c0 0 ). The normalization scales the number of continuum events down by approximately a factor of three compared to the prediction by the generator (with a relative uncertainty of the normalization of roughly 20 %) and is applied as a function of the invariant mass M (\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 2\u03c0 0 ) to give a precise result over the full energy range.

The result is subsequently divided by the number of events before selection, yielding the global efficiency shown in Fig. 6. The sharp drop observed at low invariant masses is due to the kinematics of the ISR process. Low invariant masses correspond to a very high energetic ISR photon. Momentum conservation then dictates that the hadronic system must be emitted in a relatively small cone in the opposite direction of the ISR photon. Therefore, at small hadronic invariant masses the inefficiency due to overlapping tracks or photons is increased. Because ISR photons are radiated mostly at small polar angles, the probability of losing part of the hadronic system to the non-fiducial volume of the detector is significantly enhanced at small invariant masses.

The AfkQed generator used in combination with the detector simulation contains corrections for NLO-ISR collinear to the beam as well as FSR corrections implemented by PHO-TOS [18]. The NLO-ISR correction is calculated by comparing the generator with PHOKHARA [8], which includes the full ISR contributions up to NLO. An effect of (0.8 \u00b1 0.1 stat \u00b1 0.5 syst ) %, constant in M (\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 2\u03c0 0 ), is observed and subsequently corrected for. Final-state radiation shifts events towards smaller invariant masses. Therefore, a mass-dependent correction is applied corresponding to the relative change in the content of each mass bin. This is calculated by dividing the simulated event rate with FSR by the event rate without FSR, as shown in Fig. 8. The measured event distribution is then divided by the phenomenological fit function to reverse the effect of FSR. Besides radiative effects, the mass resolution is considered in the cross section measurement. The invariant mass M (\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 2\u03c0 0 ) has a resolution of 15 MeV/c 2 in the range of interest. Since the cross section is given in bins of 20 MeV/c 2 , events with nominal bin-center mass are distributed such that 50 % will lie in the central bin, 23 % in each neighboring bin, and 2 % in the next bins. The effect of the mass resolution has been studied by performing unfolding procedures based on singular value decomposition [23] and Tikhonov regularized \u03c7 2 minimization with L-curve optimization [24]. It is observed that the effect of the mass resolution is consistent with zero with a systematic uncertainty of 0.3 %. Once all corrections are applied and the efficiency is determined (including data-MC differences from photon, track and \u03c0 0 detection), Eq. (3) is employed to calculate the non-radiative cross section \u03c3, displayed in Fig. 9 and listed in Table I.",

These shed light on the production process of hadrons and can probe theoretical models or provide input for the latter [39]. In Ref. [34] it is suggested that the channel e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 2\u03c0 0 is described completely by the intermediate states a 1 \u03c0 and \u03c9\u03c0 0 in the energy range 0.98 GeV < E CM < 1.38 GeV. Furthermore, the authors do not observe a \u03c1 0 signal in their data, consistent with earlier measurements [40]. In this work, a study of the a 1 \u03c0 intermediate state is undertaken but due to the large width of the a 1 resonance it is not possible to quantify the a 1 \u03c0 contribution. The role of the \u03c9\u03c0 0 substructure and a possible \u03c1 0 contribution are investigated in this work over a wider energy range than in previous measurements. A complete study of the dynamics of this process would require a partial wave analysis, preferably in combination with the channel e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 . Since this is beyond the scope of this analysis, only selected intermediate states are presented here. The efficiency as function of the mass of the sub-system is calculated using AfkQed by dividing the mass distribution after \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 2\u03c0 0 \u03b3 selection and detector simulation by the distribution of the generated mass. Furthermore, unless stated otherwise no background subtraction is applied to data when graphing the mass distribution of a subsystem.",

Fitting a Voigt profile plus a normal distribution (for the radiative tail) to the efficiency corrected M (\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 ) distribution, as shown in Fig. 12, results in an \u03c9\u03c0 0 production fraction of (32.1 \u00b1 0.2 stat \u00b1 2.6 syst ) % over the full invariant mass range. The systematic uncertainty is determined as the difference from an alternative fit function. The same fitting procedure is applied in narrow slices of the invariant mass M (\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 2\u03c0 0 ). The resulting number of events is divided by the ISR-luminosity in each mass region, yielding the cross section \u03c3(e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c9\u03c0 0 \u03b3 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 2\u03c0 0 \u03b3) as a function of the CM-energy of the hadronic system listed in Table III and shown in Fig. 13 in comparison to existing data [41][42][43][44]. In this case, possible background processes are removed by the fit function. The \u03c9\u03c0 0 production fraction dominates at low masses, then decreases rapidly, such that it is on the level of 10 % already at M (\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 2\u03c0 0 ) \u2248 1.8 GeV/c 2 , decreasing further towards higher masses.
