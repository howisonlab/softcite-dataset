The data were collected with the CMS detector at the CERN LHC and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 2.2 fb \u22121 . The observations are in agreement with standard model predictions. An upper limit at 95% confidence level on the product of the production cross section and branching fraction into tau lepton pairs is calculated as a function of the resonance mass. For the sequential standard model, the presence of Z bosons decaying into tau lepton pairs is excluded for Z masses below 2.1 TeV, extending previous limits for this final state. For the topcolor-assisted technicolor model, which predicts Z bosons that preferentially couple to third-generation fermions, Z masses below 1.7 TeV are excluded, representing the most stringent limit to date.",

Nevertheless, it cannot be an ultimate theory of nature since it fails, for instance, to provide an explanation for the mass of neutrinos and lacks a particle candidate for dark matter. Many models of physics beyond the SM have therefore been proposed. Such models often predict new heavy particles that could be observed at the CERN LHC.",

Individual hadronic \u03c4 decay modes are reconstructed separately. The signatures distinguished by the algorithm are: a single charged hadron, a charged hadron plus up to two neutral pions, and three charged hadrons. Reconstructed \u03c4 h leptons are required to be isolated to reduce background from misidentified light-quark or gluon jets. The isolation criterion for \u03c4 h leptons is based on the scalar p T sum S \u03c4 of charged and neutral PF candidates within a cone of radius \u2206R = 0.5 around the \u03c4 h direction, excluding the \u03c4 h candidate and charged tracks from pileup. The contribution of neutral particles from pileup is accounted for by subtracting from S \u03c4 the scalar p T sum of charged particles from pileup interactions that appear within a cone of radius \u2206R = 0.8 around the \u03c4 h candidate, multiplied by a factor of 0.2 [19]. The factor of 0.2 is chosen to render the \u03c4 h identification efficiency insensitive to the level of pileup. The isolation criterion is S \u03c4 < 0.8 GeV. The \u03c4 h candidates are further distinguished from electrons and muons using dedicated algorithms, referred to as discriminators. The algorithm to discriminate a \u03c4 h lepton from an electron utilizes observables that quantify the compactness and shape of energy deposits in the ECAL, to distinguish electromagnetic from hadronic showers, in combination with observables that are sensitive to the amount of bremsstrahlung radiation emitted along the highest p T track of the \u03c4 h candidate, and observables that are sensitive to the overall particle multiplicity. The discriminator against muons requires that no hits in the muon system be matched to the \u03c4 h candidate. For a \u03c4 h with p T > 20 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.1, the identification efficiency is approximately 55%. The probability for a JHEP02 (2017)048light-quark or gluon jet, electron, and muon to be misidentified as a \u03c4 h is approximately 1%, 0.2%, and 0.03%.",

In order to tag jets from b quark decays, the combined secondary vertex (CSVv2) algorithm at the loose working point is used [22,23]. This algorithm is based on the reconstruction of secondary vertices, together with track-based lifetime information. For b quark jets with p T > 30 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.4, the identification efficiency is approximately 85%, while the probability for a light-quark or gluon (charm quark) jet to be misidentified as a b quark jet is approximately 10% (20%).",

Although the Drell-Yan background peaks around the Z pole mass, its tail extends into the high-mass region where a signal might be present.

Background from tt events contains one or two b quark jets, in addition to isolated \u03c4 or \u03c4 h candidates. Background from diboson events produces isolated leptons if the gauge bosons decay leptonically. Should the gauge bosons decay hadronically, one of the jets may be misidentified as a \u03c4 h lepton.

The Drell-Yan, W+jets, and tt processes are generated with the Mad-Graph5 amc@nlo program [25]. The pythia 8.2 program is used to generate the diboson and signal events [26]. The signal events are generated with Z masses ranging from 0.5 to 3.0 TeV, with a step size of 0.5 TeV. The expected signal yields are rescaled to next-to-leading order (NLO) accuracy using a K-factor of 1.3 [10]. The electroweak NLO corrections are small in the range of masses considered. The SM samples are normalized using the most accurate cross section calculations currently available [25,[27][28][29][30][31][32][33][34][35][36][37], generally with NLO or next-to-next-leading order (NNLO) accuracy. The NNPDF 3.0 [38] parton distribution functions (PDF) are used, and all simulated samples use the pythia program with the CUETP8M1 tune [39] to describe parton showering and hadronization. The simulation of pileup is performed by superimposing minimum bias interactions onto the hard -4 -JHEP02 (2017)048scattering process, matching the pileup profile in data. The mean number of interactions in a single bunch crossing in the analysed data set is approximately 14. The MC-generated events are propagated through a Geant4-based simulation [40] of the CMS apparatus.",

The strategy when using such a technique is to modify the standard event selection requirements in order to define samples enriched with events from specific sources of background. These control regions are used to model the m(\u03c4 1 , \u03c4 2 , p miss T ) shape of the backgrounds and to measure the probability for an event to satisfy the selection requirements. Contributions from additional background sources in a given control region are subtracted using their predictions from simulation. The background estimation methods based on data control regions are validated by determining the ability of the method, applied to simulated samples, to predict correctly the true number of background events and the shape of the m(\u03c4 1 , \u03c4 2 , p miss T ) distribution. In some cases, for backgrounds with misidentified leptons, the background estimation methods are also validated with the data. In such tests, the agreement between the relevant quantities is always within the statistical uncertainties, and is at the level of 20% or better, depending on the channel. In cases where an approach based on a data control region is not possible, or for backgrounds with small expected contributions, we rely on simulation. For the most relevant SM contributions evaluated from simulation, we verify that the MC prediction is in agreement with the data in background-enhanced regions.",

            "text": "The main source of systematic uncertainty is the uncertainty in the estimation of the background, due to the limited number of events in the data control regions. This results in uncertainties ranging from 8% for the contribution from dominant backgrounds such as that from W+jets events in the \u03c4 \u03c4 h channels, to 68% for the small contribution of QCD multijet events in the \u03c4 \u00b5 \u03c4 h channel. Nondominant backgrounds in the control regions, including the resulting uncertainties in the control sample purities, make a minor contribution to the overall systematic uncertainty. The efficiencies for electron and muon reconstruction, identification, and triggering have an uncertainty of approximately 2%, measured using Z \u2192 + \u2212 events [15,17]. For the uncertainty in the description by the simulation of the identification efficiency for high-p T electrons (muons), an uncertainty of 6% (7%), independent of p T , is assigned, as described in ref. [10]. The systematic uncertainty on \u03c4 h trigger efficiency is 5% per \u03c4 h candidate, as measured with Z \u2192 \u03c4 \u00b5 \u03c4 h events triggered by single-muon triggers. Systematic effects associated with \u03c4 h identification are measured using the visible \u03c4 \u03c4 mass distribution around the Z boson peak as well as off-mass-shell virtual W bosons selected with a single \u03c4 h candidate and large E miss T [19]. The resulting uncertainty is 6% per \u03c4 h candidate. An -7 -JHEP02(2017)048 additional systematic uncertainty, which dominates for high-p T \u03c4 h candidates, is related to the confidence that the MC simulation correctly models the identification efficiency, and is validated with high-p T jet and electron candidates that produce \u03c4 h -like signatures in the detector. This additional uncertainty increases linearly with p T and amounts to 20% per \u03c4 h candidate at p T = 1 TeV (correlated between both candidates in the \u03c4 h \u03c4 h channel), resulting in an uncertainty of 4% (10%) for a reconstructed mass of 0.5 TeV in the \u03c4 \u03c4 h (\u03c4 h \u03c4 h ) channel, and 12% (25%) for a mass of 2 TeV. The uncertainty in the integrated luminosity measurement is 2.7% [42]. Uncertainties that affect the m(\u03c4 1 , \u03c4 2 , p miss T ) mass shape include the electron, muon, and \u03c4 h energy scales, and the jet and E miss T energy scales and resolutions. The uncertainty in the probability for a light quark or gluon jet to be misidentified as a b quark jet (20%) is also considered, and has a \u223c3% effect on the signal acceptance and a negligible effect on the m(\u03c4 1 , \u03c4 2 , p miss T ) mass shape. The uncertainty in the signal acceptance associated with the PDFs is evaluated in accordance with the PDF4LHC recommendations [43] and amounts to a few percent.",

The upper limit on the cross section times branching fraction \u03c3(pp \u2192 Z ) B(Z \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 ) corresponds to the point where the observed limit crosses the theory curve. In the TAT model the gauge group structure is characterized by a reduced coupling to light fermions (1 st and 2 nd generations) and an enhanced coupling to heavy fermions (3 rd generation). Because light quark annihilation (e.g. uu \u2192 Z ) is the dominant Z production mechanism at the LHC, the cross section \u03c3(pp \u2192 Z ) in the TAT model is suppressed (relative to that in the SSM model) because of the reduced coupling to light quarks. On the other hand, the -9 - branching fraction B(Z \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 ) in the TAT model is enhanced as a result of the stronger coupling to \u03c4 leptons. With the TAT parameters in refs.

Overall, the product of the cross section and branching fraction \u03c3(pp \u2192 Z ) B(Z \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 ) in the TAT model is approximately one-third of the value in the SSM model.

            "text": "A search for heavy resonances decaying to a tau lepton pair has been performed by the CMS experiment, using a data sample of proton-proton collisions at \u221a s = 13 TeV collected in 2015, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.2 fb \u22121 . The tau leptons are reconstructed in their decays to an electron (\u03c4 e ) and muon (\u03c4 \u00b5 ), and in their hadronic decays (\u03c4 h ). The observed invariant mass spectra in the \u03c4 \u00b5 \u03c4 h , \u03c4 e \u03c4 h , \u03c4 h \u03c4 h , and \u03c4 e \u03c4 \u00b5 channels are measured and are found to be consistent with expectations from the standard model. Upper limits at 95% confidence level are derived for the product of the cross section and branching fraction for a Z boson decaying to a tau lepton pair, as a function of the Z mass. The presence of Z bosons decaying to a tau lepton pair is excluded for Z masses below 2.1 TeV in the sequential standard model. This is the first search for heavy resonances decaying to a tau lepton pair using events from proton-proton collisions at \u221a s = 13 TeV, already extending previous limits [6][7][8] for this final state using the data sample collected in 2015. In the topcolor-assisted technicolor model, which predicts Z bosons that exhibit enhanced couplings to third-generation fermions, the presence of Z bosons decaying to a tau lepton pair is excluded for Z masses below 1.7 TeV, resulting in the most stringent limit to date.",
