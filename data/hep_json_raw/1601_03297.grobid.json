A channel that is expected to be sensitive to new physics contributions is the decay B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c6. CP violation in the B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c6 decay occurs due to interference between direct decays and decays with B 0 s -B 0 s mixing. The oscillation frequency of B 0 s meson mixing is characterized by the mass difference \u2206m s of the heavy (B H ) and light (B L ) mass eigenstates. The CP violating phase \u03c6 s is defined as the weak phase difference between the B 0 s -B 0 s mixing amplitude and the b \u2192 ccs decay amplitude. In the absence of CP violation, the B H state would correspond to the CP -odd state and the B L to the CP -even state. In the SM the phase \u03c6 s is small and can be related to Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) quark mixing matrix elements via the relation \u03c6 s \u22122\u03b2 s , -1 -",

In addition, each event must contain at least one reconstructed primary vertex, formed from at least four ID tracks, and at least one pair of oppositely charged muon candidates that are reconstructed using information from the MS and the ID [17]. A muon identified using a combination of MS and ID track parameters is referred to as a combined-muon. A muon formed from a MS track segment that is not associated with a MS track but is matched to an ID track extrapolated to the MS is referred to as a segment-tagged muon. The muon track parameters are determined from the ID measurement alone, since the precision of the measured track parameters is dominated by the ID track reconstruction in the p T range of interest for this analysis. Pairs of oppositely charged muon tracks are refitted to a common vertex and the pair is accepted for further consideration if the quality of the fit meets the requirement \u03c7 2 /d.o.f. < 10. The invariant mass of the muon pair is calculated from the refitted track parameters. In order to account for varying mass resolution in different parts of the detector, the J/\u03c8 candidates are divided into three subsets according to the pseudorapidity \u03b7 of the muons. A maximum-likelihood fit is used to extract the J/\u03c8 mass and the corresponding mass resolution for these three subsets. When both muons have |\u03b7| < 1.05, the dimuon invariant mass must fall in the range 2.959-3.229 GeV to be accepted as a J/\u03c8 candidate.

Each of the four tracks is required to have at least one hit in the pixel detector and at least four hits in the silicon microstrip detector. The fit is further constrained by fixing the invariant mass calculated from the two muon tracks to the J/\u03c8 mass [18]. A quadruplet of tracks is accepted for further analysis if the vertex fit has a \u03c7 2 /d.o.f. < 3, the fitted p T of each track from \u03c6 \u2192 K + K \u2212 is greater than 1 GeV and the invariant mass of the track pairs (assuming that they are kaons) falls within the interval 1.0085 GeV < m(K + K \u2212 ) < 1.0305 GeV. If there is more than one accepted candidate in the event, the candidate with the lowest \u03c7 2 /d.o.f. is selected. In total, 375,987 B 0 s candidates are collected within a mass range of 5.150-5.650 GeV.",

The acceptance systematic uncertainty is small and therefore regardless of what value of \u03c1 acc is chosen the combination stays the same. For the 8 TeV measurement, electron tagging is added, therefore the systematic uncertainty is not 100% correlated. For \u03c1 tag = 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 there is negligible difference between the results. The fit model was changed between the 7 TeV and 8 TeV measurement, the most significant change is that the mass uncertainty modelling was removed and the event-by-event Gaussian error distribution was replaced with a sum of three Gaussian distributions.
