            "text": "Lepton flavor violation (LFV) in charged lepton decays is forbidden in the Standard Model (SM) and highly suppressed even if neutrino mixing is taken into account. On the other hand, extensions of the SM, such as supersymmetry, leptoquark and many other models [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8], predict LFV with branching fractions as large as 10 \u22128 , which are accessible in current B-factory experiments. We search for neutrinoless lepton-flavor-violating \u03c4 \u2212 \u2192 \u2113 \u2212 h + h \u2032\u2212 decays and lepton-number-violating \u03c4 \u2212 \u2192 \u2113 + h \u2212 h \u2032\u2212 decays [ * ] , where \u2113 is an electron or muon and h ( \u2032 ) is a charged pion or kaon. We analyse a 854 fb \u22121 data sample collected with the Belle detector [9] at the KEKB asymmetric-energy e + e \u2212 collider [10] at center-of-mass (CM) energies at or below the \u03a5(4S) and \u03a5(5S) resonances.

In the two-dimensional distribution of M \u2113hh \u2032 versus \u2206E, signal events should have M \u2113hh \u2032 close to the \u03c4 -lepton mass (m \u03c4 ) and \u2206E close to zero. From MC simulations, the dominant background for the \u03c4 \u2192 \u00b5hh \u2032 modes is from continuum and generic \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 processes, while that for the \u03c4 \u2192 ehh \u2032 modes is from two-photon processes. Therefore, the event selection is optimized mode-by-mode since the backgrounds are mode dependent. This analysis includes 27% more data than in the previous one [11]. We reoptimized the selection criteria by reblinding the whole data set in the signal region until all selection criteria are finalized. The selection criteria are determined so that the figure of merit (FOM), defined by FOM=(Signal detection efficiency)/ \u221a No. of expected background events, is maximized.

If the track on the tag side is a hadron, we also require cos \u03b8 CM tag\u2212miss < 0.85 for the \u03c4 \u2192 \u00b5hh \u2032 modes. This requirement reduces continuum background with missing energy due to neutrons or K 0 L 's since the masses of the neutron and K 0 L are larger than that of the neutrino. We also require that cos \u03b8 CM tag\u2212miss < 0.96 for \u03c4 \u2192 ehh \u2032 modes. This requirement reduces Bhabha, inelastic vector meson-photoproduction, and two-photon background, since these processes produce electron in the tag-side in many cases and the electron can produce the radiated photons which result in missing momentum if they overlap with the ECL clusters associated with the tag-side track [20]. In addition, in order to ensure that the missing particles are neutrinos rather than photons or charged particles that leave the detector acceptance, we impose requirements on p miss : We require that |p t miss |, the magnitude of the transverse component of p miss , be greater than 0.5 GeV/c (0.7 GeV/c) for the \u03c4 \u2192 \u00b5hh \u2032 (ehh \u2032 ) modes, and that its direction point into the fiducial volume of the detector. For the \u03c4 \u2212 \u2192 e \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 mode only, we apply the tighter selection requirement |p t miss | > 1.5 GeV/c.

Therefore, we apply a kaon veto, P(K/\u03c0) < 0.6, for muon candidate tracks if the tag side track is a hadron (see Fig. 1 (a)).

The value N \u03c4 \u03c4 = 782 \u00d7 10 6 is obtained from the integrated luminosity and the cross section of \u03c4 -pair production, which is calculated in KKMC [23] to be \u03c3 \u03c4 \u03c4 = 0.919 \u00b1 0.003 nb and \u03c3 \u03c4 \u03c4 = 0.875 \u00b1 0.003 nb for 782 fb \u22121 at \u03a5(4S) and 72 fb \u22121 at \u03a5(5S), respectively. Table III summarizes the results for all modes. The upper limits for the \u03c4 \u2192 ehh \u2032 modes are in the range (2.0 \u2212 3.7) \u00d7 10 \u22128 while those for the \u03c4 \u2192 \u00b5hh \u2032 modes are in the range (2.1\u22128.6)\u00d710 \u22128 . These results improve upon our previously published upper limits [11] by factors of about 1.8 on average. This improvement results both from using a larger data sample and from the introduction of an improved rejection of specific backgrounds, such as di-baryon production in the continuum for the \u03c4 \u2192 \u00b5hh \u2032 modes, and improved kinematic event selections, for example, the M \u03c0\u03c0\u03c0 requirement for the \u03c4 \u2192 \u2113\u03c0K modes.",
