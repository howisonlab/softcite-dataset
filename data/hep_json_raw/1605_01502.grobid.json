Around that time, atmospheric and accelerator neutrino experiments, e.g. Super-K [1] and K2K [2], have determined the oscillation parameters \u03b8 23 and |\u2206m 2 32 | whereas solar and reactor neutrino experiments, such as SNO [3] and KamLAND [4], measured \u03b8 12 and \u2206m 2 21 . However, the mixing angle \u03b8 13 , the CP violating phase \u03b4 CP , and the sign of \u2206m 2 32 (aka the mass hierarchy) were unknown. In addition, \u03b8 13 , unlike the other two mixing angles, was expected to be small [5,6].",

If it is too small, current technologies may not be able to determine \u03b4 CP and the mass hierarchy. The mixing angle \u03b8 13 can be measured by accelerator-based or reactorbased experiments. However, the appearance probability of \u03bd \u00b5 \u2192 \u03bd e in an accelerator neutrino experiment also depends on the yet unknown \u03b4 CP and the mass hierarchy. Hence, this type of experiments can only provide evidence for a non-zero \u03b8 13 but cannot measure its value unambiguously. On the other hand, reactor-based experiments can unambiguously determine \u03b8 13 via measuring the survival probability of the electron antineutrino \u03bd e at short distance (O(km)) from the reactors.

All six cores are functionally identical pressurized water reactors, each with a maximum of 2.9 GW of thermal power. The last core started commercial operation on 7 August 2011, a week before the start-up of the Daya Bay experiment. The distance between the cores for each pair is 88 m. The Daya Bay cores are separated from the Ling Ao cores by about 1100 m, while the Ling Ao-II cores are around 500 m away from the Ling Ao cores. The Daya Bay experiment consists of three underground experimental halls (EHs) connected with horizontal tunnels. The overburden for the Daya Bay near hall (EH1), the Ling Ao near hall (EH2) and the far hall (EH3) are 250, 265, and 860 equivalent meters of water, respectively. Eight antineutrino detectors (ADs) are installed in the three halls, with two in EH1, two in EH2, and four in EH3. Each AD has 20-ton target mass to catch the reactor antineutrinos.

With all 217 days of data acquired in the first phase, a spectral and rate analysis improved the precision of \u03b8 13 and measured the effective mass splitting \u2206m 2 ee for the first time [20]. A new analysis with 621 days of data, including the 6-AD phase and the full 8-AD configuration, was released recently; the measured sin 2 2\u03b8 13 has reached a precision of 6% [21]. These results are summarized in Table 1. Daya Bay has accumulated the largest reactor antineutrino sample in the world, which enables many precision measurements. The most precise reactor antineutrino spectrum has been measured [22]. A search for a sterile neutrino has significantly extended the exclusion area in the low-mass region of the sin 2 2\u03b8 14 -\u2206m 2 41 parameter space [23]. Many exotic searches are ongoing. The Daya Bay experiment plans to operate until 2020. A 3%-precision measurement on both sin 2 2\u03b8 13 and \u2206m 2 ee is expected.",

Such exposure corresponds to about 8 years for Daya Bay. Therefore, for most cases, the rate deficit will dominate the sensitivity, and related systematic uncertainties, including the detection efficiency, target proton number, and backgrounds, should be controlled to 0.5% to measure sin 2 2\u03b8 13 to 0.01 at 90% confidence level.",

In this case, the reactor-related uncertainties cannot be completely cancelled by the near-far relative measurement. Moving the near site farther away from the cores will improve the cancellation but lose sensitivity due to an increase in the oscillation effect. To obtain the best sensitivity, Daya Bay is configured with one far site for observing the maximal oscillation effect, and two near sites for determining the flux of the reactor antineutrinos from the Daya Bay and Ling Ao NPPs. The best locations of the three halls were determined with a \u03c7 2 method [25], with the projected uncertainties and estimated background at the candidate sites derived from geological survey information. For the optimal configuration, the uncertainty related to the reactors is reduced to 5% of the uncorrelated uncertainty of a single core (0.8%), which is totally insignificant.",

            "text": "Each AD has three nested cylindrical volumes separated by concentric acrylic vessels as shown in Fig. 2. Serving as the target for the inverse betadecay reaction, the innermost volume holds 20 t of gadolinium-doped liquid scintillator (Gd-LS) with 0.1% Gd by weight [27,28,29,30]. The middle volume is called the gamma catcher and is filled with 20 t of undoped liquid scintillator (LS) for detecting gamma-rays that escape the target volume. The outer volume contains 37 t of mineral oil (MO) to provide optical homogeneity and to shield the inner volumes against radiation from the detector components. There are 192 20-cm PMTs (Hamamatsu R5912) installed in the MO volume and around the circumference of the stainless steel vessel (SSV). The top and the bottom surfaces are not instrumented with PMTs; instead, there are two highly reflective panels. The PMTs are recessed in a 3-mm-thick black cylindrical shield located at the equator of the PMT bulb. In each hall, the ADs are submerged in a water pool that provides at least 2. The multiple-module scheme is the most prominent feature of Daya Bay. The current generation of reactor neutrino experiments for determining \u03b8 13 planned to achieve a relative detector uncertainty of (0.38-0.6)%. Such uncertainties need very careful validation. With at least two ADs in each experimental hall, comparison of performance among the ADs at the same site can actually \"measure\" the relative uncertainty between them. By comparing the components of the detector responses, the relative uncertainty of two ADs was found to be 0.2% [16]. The measured ratio of the antineutrino rates in two ADs was 0.981 \u00b1 0.004 (1.019 \u00b1 0.004) while the expected ratio was 0.982 (1.012) for the Daya Bay (Ling Ao) near site [21], validating the uncertainty estimation. The deviation from unity is due to slightly different baselines of the two ADs to the reactor cores. Furthermore, the uncertainties of the ADs are found to be largely uncorrelated. Therefore, the total relative detector uncertainty is statistically reduced by 1/ \u221a N , where N is the number of ADs at a given site.",

The electronic components or connections on the base of the Hamamatsu PMT may occasionally discharge and produce a flash of light. The detected energy of these faked events ranges from sub-MeV to a hundred MeV in Daya Bay. Although only a small fraction of the PMTs spontaneously discharge infrequently, these flasher events significantly increase the accidental-coincidence background. With the black shield, the flasher events always appear as a characteristic PMT-hit pattern; thus they can be easily identified and rejected [18].

This exponential form of the electronics response is motivated by Monte Carlo (MC) and data; it has been confirmed with an independent FADC measurement.

The quantity w i is a weight that accounts for the differences between the near-and far-site measurements. In this method, the flux and spectrum of the antineutrinos at the reactor play a negligible role [21]. The results from the fit shown in the sin 2 2\u03b8 13 -\u2206m 2 ee plane are depicted in Fig. 3. Daya Bay has also accumulated an IBD sample with neutron capture on hydrogen (nH) which has comparable statistics to that of neutron capture on gadolinium (nGd). Since the delayed signal of 2.2 MeV falls into the energy region totally dominated by natural radiation, the coincidence background is huge. By requiring the reconstructed distance between the positron and delayed-neutron vertices be < 50 cm, 98% of this background can be rejected while losing 25% of the signal. A spectral subtraction is further needed to remove the accidental backgrounds. An analysis using the 217-day data set yielded sin 2 2\u03b8 13 = 0.080 \u00b1 0.018. Since the IBD sample and the systematic uncertainties are largely independent from the nGd analysis, the nH analysis provides an independent measurement of \u03b8 13 .

With the nonlinearity model described in Sec. 4, Daya Bay has measured the prompt-energy spectrum with a precision ranging from 1.0% at 3.5 MeV to 6.7% at 7 MeV. An excess of about 10% at \u223c 5 MeV compared with expectations is observed, leading to a discrepancy of up to 4 \u03c3.",
