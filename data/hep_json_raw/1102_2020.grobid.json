The event sample, recorded with the CMS detector, corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 36 pb \u00c01 . The data are found to be in good agreement with the predictions of perturbative QCD, and yield no evidence of quark compositeness. With a modified frequentist approach, a lower limit on the contact interaction scale for left-handed quarks of \u00c3 \u00fe \u00bc 5:6 TeV (\u00c3 \u00c0 \u00bc 6:7 TeV) for destructive (constructive) interference is obtained at the 95% confidence level.",

            "text": "In the standard model, pointlike parton-parton scatterings in high energy proton-proton collisions can give rise to final states with energetic jets. At large momentum transfers, events with at least two energetic jets (dijets) may be used to confront the predictions of perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD) and to search for signatures of new physics. In parton-parton scattering, the angular distribution of the outgoing partons, d=d cos \u00c3 , is directly sensitive to the spin of the exchanged particle, where is the parton-level cross section and \u00c3 is the polar scattering angle in the parton-parton center-of-mass (c.m.) frame. While QCD predicts a noticeable deviation of the dijet angular distribution from Rutherford scattering, at small c.m. scattering angles the angular distribution is proportional to the Rutherford cross section, d=d cos \u00c3 $ 1=\u00f01 \u00c0 cos \u00c3 \u00de 2 , characteristic of spin-1 particle exchange. The dijet angular distributions do not strongly depend on the details of the parton distribution functions (PDFs), since the angular distributions for the underlying processes, qg ! qg, qq 0 ! qq 0 , and gg ! gg, are similar.",

The rapidity is related to the jet energy E and the projection of the jet momentum on the beam axis p z by y \u00bc 1 2 ln\u00bd\u00f0E \u00fe p z \u00de=\u00f0E \u00c0 p z \u00de. The variable dijet \u00bc exp\u00f02y \u00c3 \u00de is used to measure the dijet angular distribution, which for collinear massless-parton scattering takes the form dijet \u00bc \u00f01 \u00fe j cos \u00c3 j\u00de=\u00f01 \u00c0 j cos \u00c3 j\u00de. This choice of dijet , rather than \u00c3 , is motivated by the fact that d dijet =d dijet is flat for Rutherford scattering. It also allows signatures of new physics that might have a more isotropic angular distribution than QCD (e.g., quark compositeness) to be more easily examined as they would produce an excess at low values of dijet . The quantity studied in this analysis is \u00f01= dijet \u00de\u00f0d dijet =d dijet \u00de, for several ranges of the dijet invariant mass M jj . Previous searches for quark compositeness using the dijet angular distribution or related observables in pp and p \" p collisions have been reported at the Sp\" pS by the UA1 Collaboration [1], at the Fermilab Tevatron Collider by the D0 [2,3] and CDF Collaborations [4], and at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) by the ATLAS Collaboration [5]. The CMS Collaboration has also published a search on quark compositeness with a smaller data sample using the dijet centrality ratio [6]. In this Letter, we present the first measurement of dijet angular distributions from CMS in pp collisions at ffiffi ffi",

The ECAL is made up of lead-tungstate crystals, while the HCAL is made of layers of plates of brass and plastic scintillator. These calorimeters provide coverage in pseudorapidity up to jj 3, where \u00bc \u00c0 ln tan\u00f0=2\u00de and is the polar angle relative to the counterclockwise proton beam direction. An iron or quartz-fiber \u010c erenkov hadron calorimeter (HF) covers pseudorapidities 3 < jj < 5. In addition, a preshower detector made of silicon sensor planes and lead absorbers is located in front of the ECAL at 1:653 < jj < 2:6. The calorimeter cells are grouped in projective towers of granularity in pseudorapidity and azimuthal angle of 0:087 \u00c2 0:087 at central pseudorapidities, with coarser granularity at forward pseudorapidities. Muons are measured in gas-ionization detectors embedded in the steel magnetic field return yoke. A detailed description of the CMS detector can be found elsewhere [7].",

The jets at L1 and HLT were reconstructed using energies measured by the ECAL, HCAL, and HF, and were not corrected for the jet energy response of the calorimeters. All except the highest-threshold jet trigger were prescaled as the LHC instantaneous luminosity increased during the course of data taking. In each case, the trigger efficiency was measured as a function of dijet invariant mass M jj using events selected by a lower-threshold trigger. For the analysis, M jj and dijet regions were chosen such that the trigger efficiencies exceeded 99%.",

The correction factors were determined using two independent Monte Carlo (MC) samples: PYTHIA 6.422 [14] with tune D6T [15] and HERWIG\u00fe\u00fe 2.4.2 [16]. The four-momentum, rapidity, and azimuthal angle of each generated jet were smeared to reproduce the measured resolutions. The ratio of the two dijet angular distributions (the generated distribution and the smeared one) determined the unfolding correction factors for a given MC sample and for each M jj range. The average of the correction factors for each M jj range from the two MC samples formed the final unfolding correction applied to the data. The correction factors change the normalized dijet angular distributions for all M jj ranges by less than 3%. For each M jj range, the systematic uncertainty associated with each correction factor was set at 50% of its value. This approach covers the variations of the unfolding correction factors determined from HERWIG\u00fe\u00fe and different PYTHIA tunes (D6T and Z2 [17]) that vary on their modeling of the jet kinematic distributions. The use of a parametrized model to simulate the finite jet p T and position resolutions of the detector, to determine the unfolding correction factors, resulted in a systematic uncertainty. This was estimated to be less than 1% for all M jj ranges and was added in quadrature to the unfolding uncertainties.",

This approach is more conservative than a pure frequentist approach (Neyman construction) and prevents an exclusion claim when the data may have little sensitivity to new physics [26]. Systematic uncertainties were introduced via Bayesian integration [27] by varying them as nuisance parameters in the ensembles of pseudoexperiments according to a Gaussian distribution convoluted with the shape variation induced to the dijet distributions. We consider the QCD\u00feCI model to be excluded at the 95% confidence level if CL s < 0:05. CI scale \u00c3 \u00fe . From this we determine the lower limit on \u00c3 \u00fe to be 5.6 TeV. The observed limit agrees within 1.4 standard deviations with the expected limit of 5.0 TeV, which was evaluated at the median of the test statistics distribution of the QCD model. The observed limit is slightly higher than the expected one because, for the range M jj > 2:2 TeV, the measured dijet angular distribution at low dijet is lower than, although statistically compatible with, the QCD prediction. The limit for the CI scale was also extracted using an alternate procedure in which the data were not corrected for detector effects and instead the MC predictions were resolution smeared. The limit obtained was found to agree with the quoted one within 0.4%. The corresponding observed and expected limits on \u00c3 \u00c0 are 6.7 and 5.8 TeV, respectively.",

The dijet distributions are found to be in good agreement with NLO pQCD predictions, and are used to exclude a range of a color-and isospin-singlet contact interaction scale \u00c3 for a left-handed quark compositeness model. With a modified frequentist approach, a lower limit on the contact interaction scale of \u00c3 \u00fe \u00bc 5:6 TeV (\u00c3 \u00c0 \u00bc 6:7 TeV) for destructive (constructive) interference at the 95% confidence level is obtained, which may be compared with a limit of 5.0 TeV (5.8 TeV) expected for the number of events recorded. These are the most stringent limits on the contact interaction scale of left-handed quarks to date.
