The smallness and precision of these predicted branching fractions provide a favourable environment for observing contributions from new physics: significant deviations from SM predictions could arise in models involving non-SM heavy particles, such as those predicted in the Minimal Supersymmetric",

The CMS and LHCb collaborations reported the observation of B 0 s \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 [11,12] and evidence of B 0 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 with combined values B(B 0 s \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) = 2.8 +0.7 \u22120.6 \u00d710 \u22129 and B(B 0 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) = 3.9 +1.6 \u22121.4 \u00d710 \u221210 [13]. The LHCb Collaboration updated its Run 1 result with part of the data collected in Run 2, measuring B(B 0 s \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) = 3.0 \u00b1 0.6 +0.3 \u22120.2 \u00d7 10 \u22129 (where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second systematic) and determining B(B 0 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) < 3.4 \u00d7 10 \u221210 at 95% confidence level (CL) [14]. ATLAS has measured, with the Run 1 dataset [15], B(B 0 s \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) = 0.9 +1. 1 \u22120.8 \u00d7 10 \u22129 , while setting an upper limit on B 0 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 of 4.2 \u00d7 10 \u221210 at 95% CL. This paper reports the result of a search for B 0 s \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 and B 0 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 decays performed using pp collision data corresponding to an effective integrated luminosity of 26.3 fb \u22121 , collected at 13 TeV centre-of-mass energy during the first two years of the LHC Run 2 data-taking period using the ATLAS detector. The analysis strategy follows the approach employed in the previous ATLAS measurement [15], but uses data collected with one rather than three separate sets of trigger thresholds, applies standard ATLAS muon selection criteria (section 3) rather than a dedicated muon multivariate discriminant, and employs an improved statistical treatment of the result (section 10).",

Details of the detector, trigger, data sets, and preliminary selection criteria are discussed in sections 2 and 3. A blind analysis was performed in which data in the dimuon invariant mass range from 5166 to 5526 MeV were removed until the procedures for event selection and the details of signal yield extraction were completely defined. Section 4 introduces the three main categories of background. Section 5 describes the strategy used to reduce the probability of hadron misidentification. The final sample of candidates is selected using a multivariate classifier, designed to enhance the signal relative to the dominant dimuon background component, as discussed in section 6. Checks on the distributions of the variables used in the multivariate classifier are summarised in section 7. They are based on the comparison of data and simulation for dimuon events, for B + \u2192 J/\u03c8 K + candidates and for events selected as B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c6 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 K + K \u2212 , which provide an additional validation of the procedures used in the analysis. Section 8 details the fit procedure used to extract the yield of B + \u2192 J/\u03c8 K + events. The determination of the ratio of efficiencies in the signal and the reference channels is presented in section 9. Section 10 describes the extraction of the signal yield, obtained with an unbinned maximum-likelihood fit performed on the dimuon invariant mass distribution.

A full track reconstruction of the muon candidates is performed by the high-level trigger, where an additional loose selection is imposed on the dimuon invariant mass m \u00b5\u00b5 , accepting candidates in the range 4 GeV to 8.5 GeV. Due to the increased pile-up in 2016 data, an additional selection was added at this trigger stage, requiring the vector from the primary vertex to the dimuon vertex to have a positive component (L xy ) along the dimuon's transverse momentum direction.

Figure 2 shows the distribution of the BDT output variable for simulated signal and backgrounds, separately for continuum background and partially reconstructed events. Also shown is the BDT distribution for dimuon candidates from the sidebands of the invariant mass distribution in data. The BDT output was found to not have any significant correlation with the dimuon invariant mass. The final selection requires a BDT output value larger than 0.1439, corresponding to signal and continuum background efficiencies of 72% and 0.3% respectively. The analysis uses all candidates after this selection; however, accepted events with BDT values close to the selection threshold are effectively only constraining the background models. 4 For this reason, signal and reference channel yields and efficiencies are measured relative to the signal reference selection discussed in section 9, while the events in the final selection with lower BDT values are used to improve the background modelling.  of the BDT output can produce a variation of the background shape in separate BDT bins. The shape parameters and normalisations of the backgrounds are for this reason determined purely from data: the bb \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 X MC simulation is not used for BDT training, computation of efficiencies or normalisation purposes. The only role of the bb \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 X MC is the validation of the functional forms employed to parameterise the backgrounds on data, as discussed in section 10.1. The dependence of the background parameterisation on the BDT output variable was investigated in data and shown to be consistent with simulation, even for lower BDT values where prompt backgrounds contribute significantly. This observation is supported by the fair agreement of the BDT input variables distribution between the simulated bb \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 X background and what observed on data sidebands. Figure 3 compares the distributions of two of the most discriminating variables in the continuum background MC sample with data in the dimuon mass sidebands.

All components other than the last one have shapes constrained by MC simulation as described below, with the data fit including an additional Gaussian convolution to account for possible data-MC discrepancies in mass scale and resolution. The shape of the B + \u2192 J/\u03c8 K + mass distribution is parameterised using a Johnson S U function [32,33]. The final B + \u2192 J/\u03c8 K + yield includes the contribution from radiative effects (i.e. where photons are emitted from the B decay products). The B + \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c0 + decays are modelled by the sum of a Johnson S U function and a Gaussian function, where all parameters except the normalisation are determined from the simulation. The decay modes contributing to the PRD are classified in simulation on the basis of their mass dependence. Each of the three resulting categories contributes to the overall PRD shape with combinations of Fermi-Dirac and exponential functions, contributing differently in the low-mass region. Their shape parameters are determined from simulation. Finally, the non-resonant background is modelled with an exponential function with the shape parameter extracted from the fit. The normalisation of each component is unconstrained in the fit, which is therefore mostly independent of external inputs for the branching fractions. The residual dependence of the PRD model shapes on the relative branching fractions of the contributing decays is considered as a source of systematic uncertainty. The resulting fit, shown in figure 5, yields 334 351 B + \u2192 J/\u03c8 K + decays with a statistical uncertainty of 0.3%. The ratio of yields of B + \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c0 + and B + \u2192 J/\u03c8 K + is (3.71 \u00b1 0.09)% (where the uncertainty reported is statistical only), in agreement with the expectation from the world average [29] of (3.84 \u00b1 0.16)%.",

In the comparison with new-physics predictions, the value of B(B 0 s \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) obtained from this analysis should be corrected by +3.6% or +7.8% respectively for A \u00b5\u00b5 \u2206\u0393 = 0 and \u22121.",

The separation of the candidates according to BDT bins introduces an additional dependence on the relative efficiencies in each BDT bin, and systematic uncertainties in these relative efficiencies must be accounted for. Two different procedures are explored. First, the distribution of the BDT output is compared between MC simulation and background-subtracted data for the reference and control channels. The differences observed in the ratio of data to simulation are described with a linear dependence on the BDT output. The linear dependencies observed for B + \u2192 J/\u03c8 K + and B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c6 are in turn used to reweight the BDT-output distribution in the B 0 (s) \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 MC sample. The maximum corresponding absolute variations in the efficiencies are equal to +1.7% and \u22122.3% respectively in the second and fourth BDT intervals, with the third interval basically unaffected. A second assessment of the systematic uncertainties in the relative efficiency of the BDT intervals is obtained with a procedure similar to the one used for the event selection (section 9). For each discriminating variable, the MC sample is reweighted according to the difference between simulation and data observed in the reference channels. The variation in the efficiency of each BDT interval is taken as the contribution to the systematic uncertainty due to mis-modelling of that variable. The sum in quadrature of the variations due to all discriminating variables is found to be similar in the B + \u2192 J/\u03c8 K + and B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c6 channels. Absolute variations of \u00b11.0%, \u00b12.4% and \u00b14.4% are found in the second, third and fourth BDT intervals respectively. The first of these procedures is used as a baseline for inclusion of Gaussian terms in the signal extraction likelihood to account for the uncertainty in the relative signal efficiency in the three most sensitive BDT bins. Care is taken in constraining the sum of the efficiencies of the three intervals sensitive to the signal, since that absolute efficiency and the corresponding uncertainty are parameterised with the R \u03b5 term. Figure 7 shows the distribution of the BDT output from data and simulation for the reference channels, after reweighting the MC sample. The MC distribution for B 0 (s) \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 events is also shown, illustrating how the linear deviation obtained from the reference channels affects the simulated signal BDT output. When studying these effects, the linear fits to the ratios in figures 7(a) and 7(b) are performed in the range corresponding to the three BDT bins with the highest signal-to-background ratio, since the remaining bin is insensitive to the signal contribution.  and in others from uncertainties determined from data in the sidebands or from simulation (shapes of the background components and their variation across the BDT intervals).",
