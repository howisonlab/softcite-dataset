New physics models, instead, can introduce additional couplings to new heavy mediators at both tree and loop level and these couplings could modify the values of the branching fractions and/or angular observables with respect to the SM predictions. Hence FCNC decays of b-hadrons are a powerful probe of physics beyond the SM that can be at a scale much higher than that currently accessible by direct searches.",

They are related to measurements of branching fractions, [3][4][5][6] ratios of branching fractions, 7,8 and angular distributions. 9,10 These anomalies, together with the observed deviations from \u03c4 /\u00b5 (and \u03c4 /e) universality in b \u2192 c \u03bd charged currents, [11][12][13][14][15][16][17] have triggered several theoretical speculations about possible NP interpretations.  This paper reviews the state-of-the-art of the search for NP in FCNC b\u2212hadron decays mostly at the LHC experiments. The review is organized as follows: in Section 2 a brief summary of the theoretical framework for rare b\u2212hadron decays is presented; recent results on leptonic and semi-leptonic decays mediated by b \u2192 s + \u2212 transitions a are presented in Section 3 and Section 4, respectively. Searches for new very-weakly coupled light particles possibly produced in b\u2212meson decays are discussed in Section 5. Some conclusions are drawn in Section 6 along with an outlook for the results expected in the coming years.",

Hence these modes are particularly sensitive to models with an extended Higgs sector, as in a minimal supersymmetric extension of the SM with two Higgs doublets 50,51 or in supersymmetric models with non-universal Higgs masses. 52 Even in the absence of scalar or pseudoscalar operators, the rare decays B 0 s \u2192 + \u2212 provide strong constraints on models predicting NP contributions in C 10 or a non-zero C 10 , that contribute also to semi-leptonic b \u2192 q + \u2212 transitions. These operators can receive contributions from an effective flavour-changing Z couplings and/or by the exchange of a new heavy neutral vector boson Z 53 or various types of scalar or vector leptoquarks. 54 In the SM, only the heavy state decays to \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 but this condition does not necessarily hold in NP scenarios. 55 The contributions from the two states can be disentangled by measuring the B 0 s \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 effective lifetime which, in the search for physics beyond the SM, is a complementary probe to the branching fraction measurement.",

In fact, at low q 2 SM contribution is dominated by the dipole operator associated to the photon pole and NP effects are expected to be highly reduced in this bin, unless light long-range NP effects are present. 125 Different attempts have been tried to explain this coherent set of anomalies in terms of NP affecting the O 9 and O 10 operators. NP can contribute at tree level, via the exchange of a heavy vector-boson Z , 62,63,121,[126][127][128][129][130][131][132][133][134] or of a scalar or vector lepto-quark, 23,27,28,61,[135][136][137] or at the loop level via box diagrams including new particles [138][139][140] or Z penguin diagrams. 141 A popular category of Z models relies on gauging L \u03c4 \u2212 L \u00b5 lepton number. 63,128,131,142,143 These models are well suited to explain LFU violations in R K and R * K given the vanishing coupling to electrons of the Z . Moreover, the inclusion of the Z into a SU (2) gauge symmetry, allows also to explain the R D and R * D anomalies, via a tree-level exchange of a W \u2212boson in the b \u2192 c \u2212 \u03bd transitions 20,26 If the Z coupling to muons occurs at the loop level, NP contributions responsible of the b \u2192 c + \u2212 anomalies could possibly also explain the (g \u2212 2) \u00b5 anomaly. 141 Models with lepto-quarks that couple leptons to quarks at the tree level intrinsically violate LFU and are therefore excellent candidates to accommodate LFU violating measurements as R K , R K * and R ( * ) D . 23,27,61,[135][136][137] Moreover lepto-quark models induce tree-level transition in b \u2192 s + \u2212 processes and would therefore escape constraints from B 0 s \u2212 B 0 s mixing, where they would contribute only at the loop level. On the other hand direct searches [144][145][146][147][148][149][150] already severely constrain some of these models and more are expected to be challenged in the near future.",
