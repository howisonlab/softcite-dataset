The smuon (muon sneutrino) is expected to decay into a muon and a neutralino (chargino), which will then decay into a second muon and at least two jets. The analysis is based on the 2016 data set of proton-proton collisions at \u221a s = 13 TeV recorded with the CMS detector at the LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 . No significant deviation is observed with respect to standard model expectations. Upper limits on cross sections, ranging from 0.24 to 730 fb, are derived in the context of two simplified models representing the dominant signal contributions leading to a same-sign muon pair. The cross section limits are translated into coupling limits for a modified constrained minimal supersymmetric model with \u03bb 211 as the only nonzero R-parity violating coupling. The results significantly extend restrictions of the parameter space compared with previous searches for similar models.",

The SU (2) L weak isospin and SU (3) C color indices are suppressed. The terms associated with the coupling parameters \u03bb, \u03bb , and \u03ba would lead to lepton number violation, while the one linked to \u03bb would cause baryon number violation. A combination of these terms would lead to a rapid decay of the proton, which is not observed. To preserve the proton stability, additional symmetries are introduced. A common choice is to introduce R-parity conservation (RPC), which forbids all the terms in Eq. (1). The R-parity of a particle is defined as (\u22121) 2s+3(B\u2212L) [8], where s, B, and L denote the spin, the baryon number, and the lepton number of the particle, respectively. However, there are other symmetries that can replace R-parity and keep the proton stable [14,15]. SUSY theories in which R-parity conservation is not imposed are usually called R-parity violating (RPV) models. A detailed review of RPV SUSY can be found in Ref. [16]. In RPC SUSY models, sparticles can only be produced in pairs, and the lightest sparticle (LSP) is stable. If the LSP is neutral (e.g., the lightest neutralino \u03c7 0 1 ), experimental signatures at hadron colliders usually involve a large amount of missing transverse momentum due to undetected LSPs. In RPV SUSY models, the signatures can differ greatly from RPC scenarios. The LSP can decay back into SM particles, and the strong exclusion limits for sparticles from RPC searches do not necessarily apply to RPV models. In addition, RPV models allow for different production mechanisms, such as the resonant production of sleptons from qq collisions, which will be investigated in this paper.",

            "text": "At the CERN LHC, sleptons -the scalar superpartners of leptons -can be produced in qq interactions as s-channel resonances via the trilinear L Q D term of the superpotential. The coupling strength of this interaction is characterized by \u03bb ijk , where i specifies the lepton and j, k the quark generations. For proton-proton (pp) collisions at the LHC, the contributions from the first quark generation (j = k = 1) are dominant. The lepton index determines which sleptons can be produced via this coupling. It also defines the possible decay modes of the LSP, since all decay modes of the LSP into SM particles must involve RPV couplings. Resonant slepton production was first proposed in Refs. [17][18][19] as a viable signature for RPV SUSY at hadron colliders. Detailed studies of resonant slepton production leading to a same-sign (SS) dilepton signature were presented in Refs. [20][21][22]. Resonant slepton production was also suggested as a possible explanation for observed deviations from the SM at the Tevatron and the LHC [23][24][25].",

In the diagrams shown in Fig. 1, a smuon ( \u03bc L ) or a muon sneutrino ( \u03bd \u03bc ) is produced in qq (ud, ud, dd) annihilation and decays into a muon and either the LSP neutralino ( \u03c7 0 1 ) or the lightest chargino ( \u03c7 \u00b1 1 ). The \u03c7 \u00b1 1 will further decay into the LSP and a W boson. All decay chains in Fig. 1 end with the decay of the LSP into a second muon and two light quarks via an off-shell smuon ( \u03bc * L ) in an effective three-body decay. The decay of the \u03bc * L involves the RPV coupling \u03bb 211 , so that R-parity is violated in the production and the decay of the slepton. The probed values of \u03bb 211 are large enough to ensure a prompt decay of the LSP. Because of the Majorana nature of the LSP, the second muon will have the same charge as the first one with a probability of 50%. Same-sign dilepton production is rare in the SM, and is therefore well suited as a signature for new physics searches. For the signal models, a simplified model approach [34,35] is used, where the dominant signal contributions are extracted and simulated as independent signals assuming a branching fraction of 100%. One advantage of this approach is that the final exclusion limits are less model dependent than for one based strictly on the cMSSM, since the sparticle masses can be set to combinations not allowed in the cMSSM, and the signal contributions are split into the different production mechanisms and decay chains. The upper and lower diagrams of Fig. 1 will be called simplified model 1 (SM1) and simplified model 2 (SM2), respectively. Another important contribution to SS muon pair production via \u03bb 211 in the modified cMSSM comes from a process similar to the one Fig. 1 Signal contributions from a modified cMSSM with \u03bb 211 as an additional coupling, which are considered as simplified signal models SM1 (upper) and SM2 (lower) in this search. The charge conjugate diagrams are included as well shown in Fig. 1 (lower). In this process, a \u03bc L is produced and decays as \u03bc L \u2192 \u03c7 0 2 \u03bc (instead of \u03bd \u03bc \u2192 \u03c7 \u00b1 1 \u03bc). The \u03c7 0 2 then decays into a Z boson and the LSP. As long as the W boson from Fig. 1 (lower) and the Z boson decay into quarks, there is no difference in analysis sensitivity between these processes. Therefore, exclusion limits of SM2 will also apply for this additional decay chain. The results of the search are interpreted in terms of SM1 and SM2 as well as the modified cMSSM.",

Within the solenoid volume are a silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL), and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter (HCAL), each composed of a barrel and two endcap sections. Forward calorimeters extend the pseudorapidity (\u03b7) coverage provided by the barrel and endcap detectors. Muons are detected in gas-ionization chambers embedded in the steel flux-return yoke outside the solenoid. A more detailed description of the CMS detector, together with a definition of the coordinate system used and the relevant kinematic variables, can be found in Ref. [36]. Events of interest are selected using a two-tiered trigger system [37]. The first level, composed of custom hardware processors, uses information from the calorimeters and muon detectors to select events at a rate of around 100 kHz within a time interval of less than 4 \u00b5s. The second level, known as the high-level trigger, consists of a farm of processors running a version of the full event reconstruction software optimized for fast processing, and reduces the event rate to around 1 kHz before data storage.",

            "text": "The particle-flow algorithm [38] aims to reconstruct and identify each individual particle in an event, with an optimized combination of information from the various elements of the CMS detector. The energy of electrons is determined from a combination of the electron momentum at the primary interaction vertex as determined by the tracker, the energy of the corresponding ECAL cluster, and the energy sum of all bremsstrahlung photons spatially compatible with originating from the electron track. The energy of charged hadrons is determined from a combination of their momentum measured in the tracker and the matching ECAL and HCAL energy deposits, corrected for zero-suppression effects and for the response function of the calorimeters to hadronic showers. Finally, the energy of neutral hadrons is obtained from the corresponding corrected ECAL and HCAL energies. The missing transverse momentum vector p miss T is defined as the projection onto the plane perpendicular to the beam axis of the negative vector sum of the momenta of all reconstructed particle-flow objects in an event. Its magnitude is referred to as p miss T . Hadronic jets are clustered from these reconstructed particles using the infrared and collinear safe anti-k T algorithm [39,40] with a distance parameter of 0.4. The jet momentum is determined as the vectorial sum of all particle momenta in the jet, and is found from simulation to be within 5-10% of the true momentum over the whole transverse momentum ( p T ) spectrum and detector acceptance [41]. Additional proton-proton interactions within the same or nearby bunch crossings can contribute additional tracks and calorimetric energy depositions to the jet momentum. To mitigate this effect, tracks identified to be originating from pileup vertices are discarded, and an offset factor is applied to correct for remaining contributions. Jet energy corrections are derived from simulation to bring the measured response of jets to that of particle level jets on average. In situ measurements of the momentum balance in dijet, photon+jet, Z +jet, and multijet events are used to account for any residual differences in jet energy scale in data and simulation. Additional selection criteria are applied to each jet to remove jets potentially dominated by anomalous contributions from various subdetector components or reconstruction failures. Jets are classified as originating from a bottom quark (b tagged) if they pass the medium working point requirements from the combined secondary vertex algorithm (v2) [42]. The medium working point is defined to have a misidentification probability of 1% for jets from light quarks or gluons in a simulated multijet sample. For this working point, the b jet identification efficiency is around 63% for b jets with p T > 20 GeV in simulated tt events.",

These events arise mostly from tt production, where one of the muons is produced in the decay of a bottom hadron. The tight-to-loose ratio method has two main steps. First, the ratio of the number of muons passing the tight working point to the number of muons passing the loose one ( TL ) is measured in a CR that is dominated by SM events consisting of jets produced through the strong interaction (QCD multijet events). Here, tight muons are muons fulfilling all selection criteria from Sect. 4, while loose muons have relaxed constraints on the isolation. This measurement region contains events with exactly one loose muon candidate and at least two jets. To reduce the contamination of prompt leptons in the TL measurement (mostly from W \u2192 \u03bc\u03bd), the transverse mass of the lepton and p miss T for events in the CR has to be smaller than 30 GeV. The remaining contribution from prompt leptons is estimated from simulation and subtracted from the numerator and denominator of TL . Typical values for TL are in the range of 0.05-0.07. In the second step, events from application regions are used as a proxy for the nonprompt contributions to the SR. Events in these regions have to pass the same requirements as SR events, with the exception that one or both muons fulfill only the loose, but not the tight, selection criteria. The contributions from events with two prompt muons are removed using simulations. For each muon that is loose but not tight the event is weighted with TL /(1 \u2212 TL ). The measurement of TL is performed as a function of muon \u03b7 and p corr T , which is defined as the muon p T corrected according to the amount of energy in the isolation cone above the tight threshold. This is done to reduce the impact of differences between the measurement region (QCD multijet dominated) and the application regions (tt dominated). A detailed explanation of the tightto-loose ratio method and the definition of p corr T is given in Refs. [31,70].",

If the decay is very asymmetric, only one of the muons will pass the muon p T threshold. Such conversions combined with the production of, e.g., a W boson can contribute to the SR. The performance of the conversion background simulation is validated in a three-lepton CR, where the invariant mass of the opposite-sign muon pair closest to the Z boson mass (m Z ) is smaller than 75 GeV and the invariant mass of the three muons fulfills m \u03bc\u03bc\u03bc \u2212 m Z < 15 GeV.  The resulting yields in data and simulation are consistent within the normalization uncertainty assigned to these processes (see Sect. 6). This background is referred to as \u03b3 + X in the following. The most important backgrounds in the first two SR bins are processes with nonprompt muons followed by VV production. With increasing m(\u03bc 2 j 1 j 2 ) and m(\u03bc 1 \u03bc 2 + jets), the nonprompt background contributions become less relevant, making VV production the most important background for the other SR bins. Nonprompt and VV backgrounds account for 78% of the overall background. The next most important background is tt(V, H) production making up around 10% of the total background. The remaining 12% originates in equal amounts from \u03b3 + X and the rare processes grouped as other backgrounds. Studies based on simulations indicate that the charge misidentification probability is negligible for muons passing the chosen identification criteria.",

These uncertainties are taken into account for both expected signal and background yields. For the integrated luminosity measurement an uncertainty of 2.5% is assigned [73]. The pileup simulation uses the total inelastic cross section, which is varied around its nominal value to obtain an uncertainty estimate. This results in shifts of 0-8% in the expected yields for individual SR bins. The trigger, muon identification, and b tagging efficiencies are measured in data and in simulation. The differences between the two are corrected for by applying scale factors to the simulated events. Uncertainties in these measurements are propagated to the scale factors and used as systematic uncertainties. For the trigger efficiency measured in an independent data set this results in an uncertainty of 2% on the predicted simulation-based background yields. The muon identification uncertainty amounts to 3% per muon, which is based on tag-and-probe measurement techniques. For the b tag-ging efficiency [42], the scale factors vary by 1-2% for b jets and around 10% for light jets. This leads to yield variations between 1 and 2% for simulation-based backgrounds. The jet energy measurement in simulation is corrected to match the energy scale as well as the resolution observed in data. Adding these two uncertainties in quadrature leads to variations between 1 and 8% of the background yields from simulation. For the nonprompt muon background estimate, several uncertainties are taken into account. The statistical uncertainty due to the finite number of events in the tight-toloose ratio measurement region and the application region is propagated to the resulting event yields. In addition, uncer- tainties due to prompt-lepton contamination in the tight-toloose ratio measurement are considered. In total, this results in uncertainties between 32 and 56% for this background. The fit to obtain the normalization of WZ and ttZ processes, described in Sect. 5, results in scale factors with uncertainties of 15% (50%) for the WZ (ttZ) process, which include both statistical and systematic components.",

The asymmetric combinations, where one of the scales is multiplied by a factor of 2 while the other is multiplied by a factor of 0.5, are omitted [74,75]. In addition, the different replicas of the NNPDF3.0 [60] set are used to estimate the uncertainties due to the proton PDFs. This results in normalization uncertainties of 21% (14%) for W \u00b1 W \u00b1 (ttW) production. For WZ and ttZ only the difference in shape is taken into account, since the normalization and its uncertainty are obtained from data. For the less important backgrounds (\u03b3 + X, ttH, other), a flat 50% normalization uncertainty is used instead of the scale and PDF variations for each process group. The uncertainties in the shapes of VV and ttV processes due to scale and PDF variations are below 10%. Based on a comparison of samples from different generators (MadGraph5_amc@nlo, powheg), an additional uncertainty is assigned to the W \u00b1 W \u00b1 background estimate, which amounts to 4-25%. The uncertainty in the third lepton veto efficiency correction for WZ is in the range of 7-24% and obtained from the uncertainty in the scale factors. For all processes, uncertainties due to limited sample sizes are taken into account. These are taken as uncorrelated among the individual SR bins and only affect the shape but not the overall expected yields. Their magnitude is within 3-32%.",

For this benchmark model, the cMSSM parameters are set to tan \u03b2 = 20, \u03bc > 0, and A 0 = 0. Here, tan \u03b2 is the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the neutral components of the two Higgs doublets, \u03bc the SUSY Higgsino mass parameter, and A 0 the universal trilinear coupling. The coupling limits are derived for each mass combination of \u03bc L and \u03c7 0 1 in SM1 where the mass combination corresponds to a valid cMSSM point. The full model cross section times the branching fraction for the decay according to SM1 is equal to the observed SM1 cross section limit at a specific value of \u03bb 211 . This value corresponds to the expected upper bound on the coupling. Full model cross sections have been calculated with Mad-Graph5_amc@nlo for a coupling value of \u03bb 211 = 0.01. All \u03bb 211 coupling values are given at the unification scale. Cross sections for different values of the coupling are extrapolated assuming a scaling of the cross section with \u03bb 2 211 . Signal points where this assumption is not valid are discarded, e.g., for values where the branching fraction of the \u03bc L or \u03bd \u03bc into quarks becomes relevant.

For the cMSSM-like model, no constraint on the Higgs boson mass was imposed. For three chosen values, the parameters corresponding to the mass of the lightest Higgs boson in the model calculated with a top quark mass of 172.5 GeV are shown as dashed lines. Using a similar method, coupling limits are derived for the SM2 points where the three involved masses correspond to a valid cMSSM point. These results are listed in Table 3.

            "text": "A search for resonant production of second-generation sleptons ( \u03bc L , \u03bd \u03bc ) using 35.9 fb \u22121 of proton-proton collisions recorded in 2016 with the CMS detector has been presented. The search targets resonant slepton production via the Rparity violating coupling \u03bb 211 to quarks in final states with two same-sign muons and at least two jets. No significant excess over the background expectation is observed. Upper limits on cross sections are set in the context of two simplified models covering the dominant production mechanisms in a modified constrained minimal supersymmetric model (cMSSM) with \u03bb 211 as an additional coupling. These limits, ranging from 0.24 to 730 fb, are translated into limits on the coupling \u03bb 211 in the modified cMSSM, and represent the most stringent limits on this particular model of R-parity violating supersymmetry. accelerator departments for the excellent performance of the LHC and thank the technical and administrative staffs at CERN and at other CMS institutes for their contributions to the success of the CMS effort.
