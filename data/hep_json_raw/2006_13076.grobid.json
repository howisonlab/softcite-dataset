The dataset corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 139 fb \u22121 . Events with exactly one charged lepton and four or more jets in the final state, with at least one jet containing b-hadrons, are used to determine the tt production cross-section through a profile-likelihood fit. The inclusive cross-section is measured to be \u03c3 inc = 830 \u00b1 0.4 (stat.) \u00b1 36 (syst.) \u00b1 14 (lumi.) pb with a relative uncertainty of 4.6%.",

Studies of top-quark production and decays provide a precise probe of the SM as well as its extensions [3]. At the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC), top quarks are primarily produced in quark-antiquark pairs (tt) and form an important background in many searches for physics beyond the SM. Thus, a precise measurement of the tt cross-section, and comparison with theoretical predictions of high precision, are a critical part of the LHC physics programme.",

The inner tracking detector covers the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 2.5 and is composed of silicon pixel, silicon microstrip, and transition radiation tracking (TRT) detectors. Lead/liquid-argon (LAr) sampling calorimeters provide electromagnetic (EM) energy measurements with high granularity. Hadronic calorimetry is provided by the steel/scintillator-tile calorimeter covering the central pseudorapidity range (|\u03b7| < 1.7). The endcap and forward regions are instrumented with LAr calorimeters for both the EM and hadronic energy measurements up to |\u03b7| = 4.9. The muon spectrometer surrounds the calorimeters and is based on three large air-core toroidal superconducting magnets with eight coils each. The field integral of the toroids ranges between 2.0 and 6.0 Tm across most of the detector. The muon spectrometer includes a system of precision tracking chambers and fast detectors for triggering. A twolevel trigger system is used to select events. The first-level trigger is implemented in hardware and uses a subset of the detector information to keep the accepted event rate below 100 kHz [30]. This is followed by a software-based trigger that reduces the accepted event rate to 1 kHz on average.",

Events are required to pass a single-electron or single-muon trigger with thresholds that were progressively raised during the data collection period to account for the increase of instantaneous luminosity. Monte Carlo (MC) simulations are used to optimise the analysis and to evaluate acceptances, efficiencies and uncertainties in tt signal and all backgrounds except for the multijet background that is estimated using a data-driven technique. The effect of multiple interactions in the same and neighbouring bunch crossings (pileup) was modelled by overlaying the original hard-scattering event with simulated inelastic pp events generated by Pythia 8.186 [32] using the NNPDF2.3 LO set of PDFs [16] and parameter values set according to the A3 tune [33].",

In this analysis, the full difference between the nominal and the reweighted simulated tt sample is taken as a systematic uncertainty and symmetrised. This approach is preferable to applying a correction to the nominal simulation because for some variables the level of agreement between data and prediction deteriorates after applying the correction. To avoid double counting, modelling uncertainties, which are evaluated using alternative samples, are derived as the difference between the nominal and alternative samples, both reweighted to the top-quark p T theory prediction.",

The ranking plot shows that the uncertainty in \u03c3 inc is dominated by the difference in the tt inclusive acceptance and the migration parameter between the nominal and the alternative parton shower and hadronisation model. The NP corresponding to the migration parameter is constrained, indicating that the normalisation effects of the alternative model vary significantly between the three regions. In SR1 (SR3), the alternative model predicts 1.4% (2.3%) larger yield while in SR2 it predicts 7.1% smaller yield than in the nominal tt simulation. These variations are much larger than the data uncertainty and allow the data to constrain this uncertainty. To check that this choice for the parameterisation of the parton shower systematic uncertainty does not affect the result, an alternative parameterisation is implemented with three normalisation and three shape NPs uncorrelated between three signal regions. No change in the central value or total uncertainty is observed, while the parameters show similar level of constraints and pulls as in the baseline fit. Other significant contributions to the uncertainty arise from the modelling of finalstate radiation in SR1 and the top-quark p T model. As expected, the latter is pulled towards the NNLO prediction, which is approximated here by a one-dimensional top-quark p T reweighting. The uncertainty in the integrated luminosity is the highest-ranked experimental uncertainty.",

To examine the disagreement between data and prediction observed in jet p T spectra as illustrated in Fig. 2, the impact of changing the minimum jet p T requirement was studied by repeating the analysis while selecting events with a minimum jet p T of 30 GeV and 35 GeV instead of 25 GeV. In both cases, the measured cross-section changed by less than 2% and did not show a trend depending on the jet p T cut. The approach to performing ME to parton shower matching differs between NLO generators and, in general, can be a source of uncertainty. However, it is not straightforward to separate the effect of the algorithmic difference in the implementation of such matching from other effects when replacing one ME generator by an alternative one, matched to the same parton shower. This may involve changes in the parameters of the parton shower that can lead to a much larger effect than the targeted one. For this reason, the effect of the generator choice is not included in the fit model. However, its impact on the result is checked by comparing two alternative tt samples generated with Powheg-Box v2 and MadGraph5_aMC@NLO, both interfaced to Herwig 7.1.3 [91]. A symmetrised difference between these two samples is applied as an additional systematic uncertainty, correlated between regions.
