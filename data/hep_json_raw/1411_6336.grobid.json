Recently, both BaBar and Belle updated their results with full data sets, and further confirmed the existence of the Y(4260) [4,5]. Since it is produced through ISR in e + e \u2212 annihilation, the Y(4260) has the quantum numbers J P C =1 \u2212\u2212 . However, there seems to be no cc slot available for the Y(4260) in the conventional charmonium family [6]. In addition, a number of unusual features, such as a strong coupling to hidden-charm final states, suggest that the Y(4260) is a non-conventional cc meson. Possible interpretations of this state can be found in Refs. [7][8][9][10][11], but all need further experimental input.",

Except for the clear signal observed in the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8 decay mode, the Belle experiment failed to find evidence of the Y(4260) via the e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b3 ISR \u03b7J/\u03c8 process [12]. Based on 13.2 pb \u22121 of e + e \u2212 data collected at \u221a s = 4.260 GeV, the CLEO experiment investigated fourteen hadronic decay channels, but the only charmonium channels with more than 3\u03c3 statistical significance are \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8, \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 J/\u03c8 and K + K \u2212 J/\u03c8 [13]. The BES Collaboration first observed the process e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b3X(3872) using data samples taken between \u221a s = 4.009 and 4.420 GeV [14], which strongly supports the existence of the radiative transition decays of the Y(4260). To further understand the nature of the Y(4260) state, an investigation into the radiative transitions between the Y(4260) and other lower mass charmonium states, like the \u03c7 cJ (J =0, 1, 2), is important [15,16]. The cross sections of e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b3\u03c7 cJ have been evaluated theoretically within the framework of nonrelativistic quantum chromodynamics (NRQCD) [16]. Experimentally, the only existing investigation comes from the CLEO experiment [13], which did not observe a signal. The large data sample collected with the BES detector provides a good opportunity to deeply investigate these decay modes, which may shed more light on the properties of the Y(4260).",
