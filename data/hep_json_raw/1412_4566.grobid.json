The ratio of the two branching fractions is B(D * 0 \u2192 D 0 \u03c0 0 )/B(D * 0 \u2192 D 0 \u03b3) = 1.90 \u00b1 0.07 \u00b1 0.05, which is independent of the assumption made above. The first uncertainties are statistical and the second ones systematic. The precision is improved by a factor of three compared to the present world average values.",

            "text": "In the framework of QCD, the building blocks of matter, colored quarks, interact with each other by exchanging SU (3) Yang-Mills gauge bosons, gluons, which are also colored. Consequently, the quark-gluon dynamics becomes nonperturbative in the low energy regime. Many effective models (EMs), such as the potential model, heavy quark and chiral symmetries, and QCD sum rules, have been developed to deal with the nonperturbative effects, as described in a recent review [2]. The charmed meson, described as a hydrogen-like hadronic system consisting of a heavy quark (c quark) and a light quark (u, d, or s quark), is a particularly suited laboratory to test the EMs mentioned above. The decay branching fractions of D * 0 to D 0 \u03c0 0 (hadronic decay) and D 0 \u03b3 (radiative decay) have been studied by a number of authors based on EMs [3][4][5][6]. A precise measurement of the branching fractions will constrain the model parameters and thereby help to improve the EMs. On the experimental side, these two branching fractions are critical input values for many measurements such as the open charm cross section in e + e \u2212 annihilation [7] and the semileptonic decays of B \u00b1 [8].",

The energy resolution for 1 GeV photons is 2.5% (5%) in the barrel (end-caps), while the position resolution is 6 mm (9 mm) in the barrel (end-caps).

In modes II and III, after requiring the invariant mass of the two photons be within \u00b115 MeV/c 2 of the nominal \u03c0 0 mass, a \u03c0 0 mass constraint is also included in the fit. The total \u03c7 2 is calculated for the fit, and when there is more than one D 0D0 combinations satisfying the selection criteria above, the one with the least total \u03c7 2 is selected. Figure 1 shows comparisons of some interesting distributions between MC simulation and data after applying the selection criteria above. Reasonable agreement between data and MC simulation is observed, and the differences are considered in the systematic uncertainty estimation. Figure 1(a) shows the total \u03c7 2 distribution; \u03c7 2 less than 30 is required to increase the purity of the signal. Figures 1(b) and 1(c) show the distributions of D 0 momentum andD 0 momentum in the e + e \u2212 center-of-mass system. The small peaks at 0.75 GeV/c are from direct e + e \u2212 \u2192 D 0D0 production. To suppress such background events, we require that the momenta of both D 0 andD 0 to be less than 0.65 GeV/c. Another source of background events is ISR production of \u03c8(3770) with subsequent decay \u03c8(3770) \u2192 D 0D0 , the number of which is obtained from MC simulation. As shown in Fig. 1(d), the right and left peaks in the distribution of the square of the D 0D0 recoil mass correspond to D * 0 \u2192 D 0 \u03c0 0 and D * 0 \u2192 D 0 \u03b3 events respectively; the respective signal regions are defined by [0.01, 0.04] and [\u22120.01, 0.01] (GeV/c 2 ) 2 in the further analysis.",

It should be noted that both the statistical and the systematic uncertainties of these two branching fractions are fully anti-correlated. Taking the correlations into account, the branching ratio B(D * 0 \u2192 D 0 \u03c0 0 )/B(D * 0 \u2192 D 0 \u03b3) = 1.90 \u00b1 0.07 \u00b1 0.05 is obtained. This ratio does not depend on any assumptions in the D * 0 decays, so it can be used in calculating the D * 0 decay branching fractions if more decay modes are discovered. Figure 3 shows a comparison of the measured branching fraction of D * 0 \u2192 D 0 \u03c0 0 with other experiments and the world average value [12]. Our measurement is consistent with the previous ones within about 1\u03c3 but with much better precision. These much improved results can be used to update the parameters in the effective models mentioned above, such as the mass of the charm quark [3,5], the effective coupling constant [4], and the magnetic moment of the charm quark [6]. With these new results as input, the uncertainty in the semileptonic decay branching fraction of B \u00b1 [8] can be reduced, thus leading to a tighter constraint on the standard model (SM) and its extensions.
