The searches were performed by the CMS Collaboration using 1.1-1.7 fb \u22121 of integrated luminosity, depending on the analysis. No excess compatible with a SM Higgs signal has been observed; the largest excursion of the observed data from the expected background has a probability of 0.4 after taking into account the look-elsewhere effect. The SM Higgs boson is excluded at 95% C.L. in three mass ranges 145-216, 226-288, and 310-400 GeV/c 2 , while the expected exclusion range is 130-440 GeV/c 2 .

In the standard model (SM) the electroweak symmetry breaking is described by so-called Higgs mechanism which leads to prediction of one scalar particle -a Higgs boson (H) [1][2][3][4][5][6]. So far, experimental searches for this particle have given negative results allowing to exclude its mass below m H < 114.4 GeV/c 2 (LEP experiments [7]) and for m H \u2208 100-108 GeV/c 2 and m H \u2208 156-177 GeV/c 2 (Tevatron experiments [8]). Indirect searches using fits to precise measurements predict relatively light Higgs boson with m H < 158 GeV/c 2 [9].",

For the low Higgs boson mass range, we observe an excess of events which leads to weaker observed limit than expected in the absence of the SM Higgs boson. The observed local p-value p 0 which quantifies the consistency of the observed excesses with the background-only hypothesis, is shown in Figure 3 (top panel) for the combined search, and split into individual decay modes in Figure 4. A broad offset for low masses, of about 1\u03c3, corresponds to the excesses seen in the H \u2192 WW * \u2192 2\u21132\u03bd channel characterised by poor mass resolution. The excesses observed in the H \u2192 ZZ \u2192 4\u2113 and the H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 channels result two narrow minima of the pvalue. The minimal p-value is p min \u223c 0.01, but after accounting for the look-elsewhere effect which is important for this study, it is reduced to a global probability p global \u223c 0.4. The look-elsewhere effect was esimeted for the whole explored mass range 110-600 GeV/c 2 . The best-fit value of \u03c3/\u03c3 SM is also presented in Figure 3 (bottom panel). The best-fit value is a factor by which the SM Higgs boson cross section has to be rescaled to best describe observed data. In the mass range between 115 and 125 GeV/c 2 the best-fit value agrees within uncertainty with 1 (\u03c3 = \u03c3 SM ), but as discussed above, with the analysed amount of data the excess is not significant. More data will increase the statistical accuracy of the search thus improve its sensitivity. Fig. 3.
