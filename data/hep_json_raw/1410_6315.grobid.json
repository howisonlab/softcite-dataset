Candidate events are selected with exactly two leptons of the same charge, two jets with large rapidity separation and high dijet mass, and moderate missing transverse energy. The signal region is expected to be dominated by electroweak same-sign W-boson pair production. The observation agrees with the standard model prediction. The observed significance is 2.0 standard deviations, where a significance of 3.1 standard deviations is expected based on the standard model. Cross section measurements for W AE W AE and WZ processes in the fiducial region are reported. Bounds on the structure of quartic vector-boson interactions are given in the framework of dimension-eight effective field theory operators, as well as limits on the production of doubly charged Higgs bosons.",

            "text": "Vector boson scattering (VBS) and quartic boson couplings are features of the standard model (SM) that remain largely unexplored by the LHC experiments. The observation of a Higgs boson [1][2][3], in accordance with a key prediction of the SM, motivates further study of the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking through measurements of VBS processes. In the absence of the SM Higgs boson, the amplitudes for these processes would increase as a function of center-of-mass energy and ultimately violate unitarity [4,5]. The Higgs boson actually observed by the LHC experiments may restore the unitarity, although some scenarios of physics beyond the SM predict enhancements for VBS through modifications to the Higgs sector or the presence of additional resonances [6,7]. This Letter presents a study of VBS in pp collisions at ffiffi ffi s p \u00bc 8 TeV. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 19.4 AE 0.5 fb \u22121 collected with the CMS detector [8] at the LHC in 2012. The aim of the analysis is to find evidence for the electroweak production of same-sign W-boson pair events. The strong production cross section is reduced by the same-sign requirement, making the experimental signature of same-sign dilepton events with two jets an ideal topology for VBS studies. Candidate events have exactly two identified leptons of the same charge, two jets with large rapidity separation and dijet mass, and moderate missing transverse energy. The final states considered are \u03bc \u00fe \u03bc \u00fe \u03bd \u03bc \u03bd \u03bc jj, e \u00fe e \u00fe \u03bd e \u03bd e jj, e \u00fe \u03bc \u00fe \u03bd e \u03bd \u03bc jj, and their charge conjugates and \u03c4-lepton decays to electrons and muons. Figure 1 shows representative Feynman diagrams for the electroweak and QCD induced production.",

Evidence for electroweak production has been reported by the ATLAS Collaboration [9]. Various extensions of the SM alter the couplings of vector bosons. An excess of events could signal the presence of anomalous quartic gauge couplings (AQGCs) [10]. Doubly charged Higgs bosons are predicted in Higgs sectors beyond the SM where weak isotriplet scalars are included [11,12]; they can be produced via weak vector-boson fusion (VBF) and decay to pairs of same-sign W bosons [13]. The central feature of the CMS apparatus is a superconducting solenoid, of 6 m internal diameter, providing a magnetic field of 3.8 T. Within the field volume are a silicon pixel and strip tracker, a crystal electromagnetic calorimeter, and a brass or scintillator hadron calorimeter. Muons are measured in gas-ionization detectors embedded in the steel flux-return yoke of the magnet. The first level of the CMS trigger system, composed of custom hardware processors, is designed to select the most interesting events within 3 \u03bcs, using information from the calorimeters and muon detectors. The high level trigger processor farm further reduces the event rate to a few hundred hertz before data storage. Details of the CMS detector and its performance can be found elsewhere [8].",

            "text": "Several Monte Carlo (MC) event generators are used to simulate the signal and background processes. The leadingorder event generator MADGRAPH 5.2 [14] is used to produce event samples of diboson production via diagrams with two or fewer powers of \u03b1 s and up to six electroweak vertices. This includes two categories of diagrams: those with exactly two powers of \u03b1 s which we refer to as quantum chromodynamic (QCD) production and those with no powers of \u03b1 s , which we refer to as electroweak (EW) production. The EW category includes diagrams with WWWW quartic interactions and diagrams where two same-sign W bosons scatter through the exchange of a Higgs boson, a Z boson, or a photon. Double-parton scattering, triboson production, and doubly charged Higgs boson production samples are also generated using MADGRAPH 5.2. Top-quark background processes are generated with the next-to-leading-order event generator POWHEG 1.0 [15][16][17][18]. The set of parton distribution functions (PDFs) used is CTEQ6L [19] for MADGRAPH and CT10 [20] for POWHEG. All event generators are interfaced to PYTHIA 6.4 [21] for the showering of the partons and subsequent hadronization. The PYTHIA parameters for the underlying event were set according to the Z2 \u00c3 tune [22]. The detector response is simulated by the GEANT4 package [23] using a detailed description of the CMS detector. The average number of simultaneous proton-proton interactions per bunch crossing in the 8 TeV data is approximately 21; additional pp interactions overlapping with the event of interest are included in the simulated samples. Collision events are selected by the trigger system requiring the presence of one or two high transverse momentum (p T ) muons or electrons. The trigger efficiency is greater than 99% for events that pass all other selection criteria explained below. A particle-flow algorithm [24,25] is used to reconstruct all observable particles in the event. It combines all the subdetector information to reconstruct individual particles and identify them as charged hadrons, neutral hadrons, photons, and leptons. The missing transverse energy E miss T is defined as the magnitude of the negative vector sum of the transverse momenta of all reconstructed particles (charged and neutral) in the event.",

The nonprompt lepton background originating from leptonic decays of heavy quarks, hadrons misidentified as leptons, and electrons from photon conversions, is suppressed by the identification and isolation requirements imposed on muons and electrons. The remaining contribution from the nonprompt lepton background is estimated directly from data. The efficiency for a predefined loose leptonlike object to pass the full lepton selection, typically called the \"tight-to-loose ratio\" (R TL ), is estimated in a control sample with one additional lepton candidate that passes the standard lepton selection criteria. To account for the dependence on kinematic observables, this ratio is parameterized as a function of p T and \u03b7. Systematic uncertainties are obtained by the application of R TL to other control samples, accounting for the sample dependence in the estimation of R TL . The WZ \u2192 3l\u03bd process is normalized in a data control region by requiring a third fully identified lepton with p T > 10 GeV. The contribution of opposite-sign dilepton events to the signal region is estimated by applying data-to-simulation charge misidentification scale factors to simulated events with two opposite-sign leptons. The charge-misidentification fraction is estimated using Z boson events and is found to be between 0.1% and 0.3% for electrons, while it is negligible for muons.",

The jet energy scale and resolution uncertainties give rise to an uncertainty in the yields of about 5%. The uncertainty in the event selection efficiency for events with neutrinos yielding genuine E miss T in the final state is assessed and leads to an uncertainty of 2%. The uncertainty in the estimated event yields, which is related to the top-quark veto, is evaluated by using a Z=\u03b3 \u00c3 \u2192 l \u00fe l \u2212 sample with at least two reconstructed jets and is found to be about 2%. The statistical uncertainty in the yield of each bin and for each process is also taken into account.

The normalization of the processes with misidentified leptons has a 36% systematic uncertainty [26], which has two sources: the dependence on the sample composition and the method used to estimate it. The WZ normalization uncertainty is 35%, dominated by the small number of events in the trilepton control region. Theoretical uncertainties are estimated by varying the renormalization and factorization scales up and down by a factor of two from their nominal value in the event, and found to be 5% for the signal normalization and 50% for the triboson background normalization. A PDF uncertainty of 6%-8% in the normalization of the signal and WZ processes is included.
