            "text": "The discovery of a new particle at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) [1] in 2012 [2,3], with a measured mass close to 125 GeV [4], opens the question of whether this is the Higgs boson of the Standard Model (SM), or part of an extended scalar sector. Charged Higgs bosons 1 are predicted in several extensions of the SM that add a second doublet [5,6] or triplets [7][8][9][10] to its scalar sector. In CP-conserving Two-Higgs-Doublet Models (2HDMs), the properties of the charged Higgs boson depend on its mass, the mixing angle \u03b1 of the neutral CP-even Higgs bosons and the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two Higgs doublets (tan \u03b2). Although the search for charged Higgs bosons presented in this paper is performed in a model-independent manner, results are interpreted in the framework of the hMSSM benchmark scenario [11,12], which is a type-II 2HDM, where down-type quarks and charged leptons couple to one Higgs doublet, while up-type quarks couple to the other. For H + masses below the top-quark mass (m H + < m top ), the main production mechanism is through the decay of a top-quark, t \u2192 bH + , in a double-resonant top-quark production. In this mass range, the decay H + \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd usually dominates in a type-II 2HDM, although H + \u2192 cs and cb may also become sizeable at low tan \u03b2. For gg \u2192 tbH + (single-resonant top-quark production). Close to the alignment limit, i.e. at cos(\u03b2\u2212\u03b1) 0, the dominant decay is H + \u2192 tb; however the branching fraction of H + \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd can reach 10-15% at large values of tan \u03b2 in a type-II 2HDM. In the intermediate-mass region (m H + m top ), accurate theoretical predictions recently became available for the non-resonant top-quark production [13], which now allows a dedicated comparison of the H + models with data near the top-quark mass. Figure 1 illustrates the main production modes for charged Higgs bosons in proton-proton (pp) collisions.",

More recently, using 3.2 fb \u22121 of data collected at \u221a s = 13 TeV, searches for charged Higgs bosons heavier than m top were performed by ATLAS in the \u03c4 \u03bd decay mode [22]. In addition, H + \u2192 W Z was searched for in the vector-boson-fusion production mode at 8 TeV by the ATLAS Collaboration [23] and at 13 TeV by the CMS Collaboration [24]. No evidence of charged Higgs bosons was found in any of these searches. The ATLAS and CMS Collaborations also searched for neutral scalar resonances decaying to a \u03c4 \u03c4 pair [25,26], to which the hMSSM is also sensitive in some regions of its parameter space.",

Depending on the assumption made for the decay mode of the W boson originating from the top-quark produced together with H + , two channels are targeted: \u03c4 had +jets if the W boson decays into a qq pair, or \u03c4 had +lepton if the W boson decays into an electron or muon and at least one neutrino (directly or via a leptonically decaying \u03c4 -lepton). The data used for this analysis are from pp collisions at \u221a s = 13 TeV, collected with the ATLAS experiment at the LHC in 2015 and 2016, corresponding to integrated luminosities of 3.2 fb \u22121 and 32.9 fb \u22121 , respectively.

Diboson processes (W W , W Z and ZZ) were simulated at NLO using the Powheg-Box v2 generator, interfaced to the Pythia v8.186 parton shower model. The CT10nlo PDF set was used for the hard-scatter process, while the CTEQL1 PDF set was used for the parton shower. The non-perturbative effects were modelled using the AZNLO [61] tune. EvtGen v1.2.0 [62] was used for the properties of bottom-and charm-hadron decays, except in samples generated with Sherpa. All simulated events were overlaid with additional minimum-bias events generated with Pythia v8.186 using the A2 [63] tune and the MSTW2008LO [64] PDF set to simulate the effect of multiple pp collisions per bunch crossing (pile-up). Simulated events were then weighted to have the same distribution of the number of collisions per bunch crossing as the data.

In order to reduce contamination by leptons from hadron decays or photon conversion, isolation requirements are applied.

Only jets with a transverse momentum p T > 25 GeV and within |\u03b7| < 2.5 are considered in the following. A multivariate technique (jet vertex tagger) that allows identification and selection of jets originating from the hard-scatter interaction through the use of tracking and vertexing information is applied to jets with p T < 60 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.4 [71]. In order to identify jets containing b-hadrons (referred to as b-jets in the following), an algorithm is used, which combines impact parameter information with the explicit identification of secondary and tertiary vertices within the jet into a multivariate discriminant [72,73]. Operating points are defined by a single threshold in the range of discriminant output values and are chosen to provide a specific b-jet efficiency in simulated tt events. The 70% working point is used in this analysis. It has rejection factors of 13, 56 and 380 against c-jets, hadronic \u03c4 decays and jets from light quarks or gluons, respectively.",

A normalisation factor is computed for this background by including the control region of the \u03c4 had-vis +lepton channel with an e\u00b5 pair and at least one b-jet as a single-bin distribution in the statistical analysis. Systematic uncertainties in the modelling of the tt background are included. Those due to the choice of parton shower and hadronisation models are derived by comparing tt events generated with Powheg-Box v2 interfaced to either Pythia6 or Herwig++ [84]. The systematic uncertainties arising from additional radiation, which modify the jet production rate, are computed with the same packages as for the baseline tt event generation, by varying the shower radiation, the factorisation and renormalisation scales, as well as the NLO radiation. The uncertainty due to the choice of matrix-element generator is evaluated by comparing tt samples generated with MadGraph5 aMC@NLO or Powheg-Box, both using the CT10 PDF set and interfaced to Herwig++. The impacts of the three systematic uncertainties listed above on the event yield of the tt background are, respectively, 14%, 4%, 13% in the \u03c4 had-vis +jets channel and 13%, 8%, 9% in the \u03c4 had-vis +lepton channel. For the W +jets and Z+jets backgrounds, uncertainties of 35% and 40% based on variations of the scales in Sherpa are considered, respectively. An additional uncertainty in the heavy-flavour jet modelling is derived by comparing the predictions of Sherpa and MadGraph5 aMC@NLO interfaced to Pythia6: it is about 6% in the \u03c4 had-vis +jets channel and 14% in the \u03c4 had-vis +lepton channel. For the small diboson backgrounds, an uncertainty of 50%, arising from the inclusive cross-section and additional jet production, is used [85].",

The largest variation of the signal acceptance is then symmetrised and taken as the scale uncertainty, 4-8% depending on the H + mass hypothesis. The signal acceptances are computed with various PDF sets, following the PDF4LHC prescriptions [86], and their envelope is taken as a systematic uncertainty. The impact of A14 tune variations on the signal acceptance is estimated by adding in quadrature the excursions from a subset of tune variations that cover underlying-event and jet-structure effects, as well as different aspects of extra jet production.

The dataset contains 36.1 fb \u22121 of pp collisions at \u221a s = 13 TeV, recorded with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. The data are found to be in agreement with the background-only hypothesis. Upper limits at the 95% confidence level are set on the H + production cross-section times the branching fraction B(H + \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd) between 4.2 pb and 2.5 fb for a charged Higgs boson mass range of 90-2000 GeV, corresponding to upper limits between 0.25% and 0.031% for the branching fraction B(t \u2192 bH + ) \u00d7 B(H + \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd) in the mass range 90-160 GeV.
