            "text": "Theories of supersymmetry (SUSY) predict the existence of a scalar partner for each standard model (SM) left-handed and right-handed fermion. When the symmetry is broken, the scalar partners acquire a mass different from their SM counterparts, the mass splitting between scalar mass eigenstates being dependent on the mass of the SM fermion. Because of the large mass of the top quark, the splitting between its chiral supersymmetric partners is potentially the largest among all supersymmetric quarks (squarks). As a result the lighter supersymmetric scalar partner of the top quark, the top squark ( t 1 ), could be the lightest squark. The search for a low mass top squark is of particular interest following the discovery of a Higgs boson [1][2][3], as a top squark with a mass in the TeV range would contribute substantially to the cancellation of the divergent loop corrections to the Higgs boson mass. SUSY scenarios with a neutralino ( \u03c7 0 1 ) as lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) and a nearly degenerate-mass t 1 provide one theoretically possible way to produce the observed relic abundance of dark matter [4,5]; this further motivates the search for the t 1 at the LHC.",

The search strategies are therefore tailored to require either one lepton or two leptons, as well as at least one b jet and a minimum amount of transverse momentum imbalance. Throughout this paper the term \"lepton\" refers only to e \u00b1 and \u00b5 \u00b1 . Previous searches for low mass top squarks in leptonic final states have been conducted by the D0, CDF, CMS, and ATLAS collaborations [6][7][8][9][10][11][12]. As shown in table 1, we categorize the decays of the t 1 as 2-body or 3-body processes and as a function of the masses of the involved particles. In all cases we take the lightest neutralino \u03c7 0 1 to be the LSP. For each decay mode we fix the corresponding t 1 branching fraction to unity; the search is in all other respects designed to be as independent as possible of the details of any specific SUSY model. We explore a range of signal mass points for each decay mode under consideration. In the decay mode tt, the unknown masses are those of the t 1 and the \u03c7 0 1 , while in the case of bbWW, a third unknown is the mass of the lightest chargino ( \u03c7 \u00b1 1 ). In the latter case we consider three possible mass assignments, labeled by the parameter x = 0.25, 0.50, 0.75; x is defined by m( \u03c7 \u00b1 1 ) = m( \u03c7 0 1 ) + x m( t 1 ) \u2212 m( \u03c7 0 1 ) .

Since the SM background   dominates the signal by several orders of magnitude and often has similar distributions for individual discriminating variables, a multivariate approach has been developed to exploit differences in the correlations among discriminating variables for signal and SM background. The background determination method has also been improved compared to ref. [12] in order to better control and correct the tail of the key transverse mass distribution. In addition to the single lepton search, we also report on a search in the dilepton mode, where the key discriminating variable is an M T2 variable [13]. The final result is based on a combination of the single lepton and dilepton searches.",

A crystal electromagnetic calorimeter and a brass/scintillator hadronic calorimeter surround the tracking detectors. The calorimeter measures the energy and direction of electrons, photons, and hadronic jets. Muons are measured in gas-ionization detectors embedded in the steel flux-return yoke outside the solenoid.

For the single-electron final state, the online selection requires the electron be isolated and have transverse momentum p T > 27 GeV; in subsequent offline analysis the reconstructed electron p T is required to exceed 30 GeV. For the single-muon final state, two triggers are used, which both require |\u03b7(\u00b5)| < 2.1: a purely leptonic trigger requiring an isolated muon with p T > 24 GeV; and an additional mixed trigger requiring an isolated muon of p T > 17 GeV together with three jets, each having p T > 30 GeV. The first trigger suffices for muons whose offline reconstructed p T exceeds 26 GeV, while the second trigger allows the analysis to use muons with reconstructed p T as low as 20 GeV; the additional jets are required in the analysis in any case. The dilepton triggers require either ee, \u00b5\u00b5, or e\u00b5 pairs. In each case, one lepton must satisfy p T > 17 GeV and the other lepton must satisfy p T > 8 GeV.

Contamination from additional pp interactions (pileup) is mitigated by discarding charged PF candidates that are incompatible with having originated from the estimated proton-proton collision point. The average pileup energy associated with neutral hadrons is computed event-by-event and subtracted from the jet energy and from the energy used when computing lepton isolation, i.e., a measure of the activity around the lepton. The energy subtracted is the average pileup energy per unit area (in \u2206\u03b7 \u00d7 \u2206\u03c6) times the jet or isolation cone area [36,37]. Candidate jets must be separated from selected leptons by \u2206R > 0.4. Relative and absolute jet energy corrections are applied to the raw jet momenta to establish a uniform jet response in |\u03b7| and a calibrated response in jet p T . We require the jets pass p T > 30 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.4. To tag jets originating from the hadronization of b quarks, we utilize the combined secondary vertex algorithm at its 'medium' operating point [38] with a corresponding efficiency for b jets of 65% and a mistag rate for light jets of 1%. Scale factors are applied to simulation samples to reproduce the efficiencies measured in the data.",

Compared to the approach of ref.

Furthermore, because the discriminating power of each input varies across the (m( t 1 ), m( \u03c7 0 1 )) mass plane, the latter is partitioned and a unique BDT is trained in each partition.

Differences in kinematic distributions may also be seen when comparing the tt and bbWW signal decay modes, and when varying the choice of x (x = 0.25, 0.50, 0.75) in the bbWW decay mode. In figure 4 we show distributions of some discriminating variables at the preselection level (but without the restriction on M T ) for both e and \u00b5 final states in data and simulated events. The figure shows good agreement between data and the total simulated background, within the uncertainties of the simulated events, which include the statistical uncertainty in the simulation samples quadratically added to the systematic uncertainty in the jet energy scale (JES). As expected from the distributions shown in figure 3, different selection variables will exhibit different degrees of discriminating power, depending on the decay mode (tt or bbWW) and the relevant mass parameters (\u2206m or x) of the signal. To find the most discriminating variables, we test different sets of candidate BDT input variables, maximizing a figure of merit that compares the expected signal yield to the quadratic sum of the statistical and systematic uncertainties in the expected background yield. To keep the selection tool simple, a new variable is incorporated into the set of input variables only if it leads to a substantial increase in the figure of merit. The training of the BDT, together with this procedure for selecting variables, is then carried out separately for the different decay modes tt and bbWW (x = 0.25, 0.50, 0.75), and across six benchmark kinematic regions, defined  as: \u2206m = (150\u00b125), (250\u00b125), (350\u00b125), (450\u00b125), (550\u00b125), and (650\u00b125) GeV. This partitioning allows us to take into account the evolution of the signal kinematics across the (m( t 1 ), m( \u03c7 0 1 )) plane.

Having been chosen with a quantitative assessment of the discriminating power of each variable, these represent the most reduced, while effective, sets of input variables to the BDT, for each decay mode and kinematic region. This represents a new feature of this search compared to ref. [12], where the BDT was trained with the same set of variables across different kinematic regions. Once the input variables to the BDT are determined, different BDTs are trained in each of the benchmark kinematic regions to build selection tools adapted to a kinematically varying signal. The simulation samples used for finding the best set of variables and training the BDT are statistically independent. This procedure is done for the tt and bbWW (different x values) decay modes. Using a more systematic approach for the definition of signal regions (SRs) than in ref. [12], we first consider which training is the best performing one in the (m( t 1 ), m( \u03c7 0 1 )) plane. We observe that some Jet Multiplicity BDTs are the best over a very limited part of the (m( t 1 ), m( \u03c7 0 1 )) plane, so to simplify the final selection we retain BDT trainings that are observed to be the best performing over a large portion of the mass plane. The resulting SRs, defined as the chosen BDT training in the (m( t 1 ), m( \u03c7 0 1 )) plane, are shown for all considered decay modes in figure 5. With these SRs determined, the final selection is made by applying a minimum threshold to each BDT output as shown in figure 6. The thresholds are determined by minimizing -10 -  the expected upper limit cross section (\u03c3 exp 95 ) obtained from events remaining above the threshold, taking into account the predicted background (section 4.2). The final BDT trainings and selections are reported in figure 5 for all decay modes; within some SRs, the same BDT training is used with different threshold values, thus leading to different selections. On average the BDT selection suppresses the SM background by a factor \u223c10 3 while reducing the signal only by a factor \u223c10; the performance improves monotonically with increasing \u2206m.

The left plot of figure 7 compares the data with background simulation, and shows some disagreement between the two for M T > 100 GeV. To correct this, we follow an approach based on template fits, which allows us to extract different correction factors for the tt \u2192 1 and the W+jets backgrounds, rather than assuming them to be equal as in ref. [12]. The template fit is performed using the invariant mass of the lepton and the jet with the highest b-tag discriminator. This variable, M b , is well modeled by the background simulation (see figure 8, left) and exhibits discriminating power between W+jets and tt \u2192 1 (figure 8, right). The contributions of the tt \u2192 background, the rare backgrounds, and the signal, are taken from simulation and their normalizations are constrained within a 20% uncertainty during the template fit. The normalizations of the tt \u2192 1 and W+jets backgrounds are free parameters expressed in terms of scale factors SF . The fit is performed in a control region with zero b-tag jets, in two separate regions of the M T distribution: the peak defined by 50 < M T < 80 GeV, and the tail defined by M T > 100 GeV. We then extract the normalization independent ratios SF R = SF tail /SF peak for tt \u2192 1 and for W+jets. Without any BDT signal selection and for a case of negligible signal contamination, the fit yields: SF R tt\u21921 = (1.04 \u00b1 0.16) and SF R W = (1.33 \u00b1 0.10).

The efficiencies for the identification and isolation of leptons are observed to be consistent within 5% for data and simulation; we take this difference as an uncertainty. The b-tagging efficiency has been varied within its uncertainties for b, c, and light flavor jets, leading to final yield uncertainties within 3% for all signal mass points. The systematic uncertainty in signal yield that is associated with the JES [41] is obtained by varying the jet energy scale within its uncertainty; the final uncertainties for all signal mass points are within 10%. Systematic uncertainties in the signal efficiency due to PDFs have been calculated [42][43][44], and are constant at \u223c5%. The effect of the systematic uncertainty due to the modeling of ISR jets by the simulation is studied by deriving data/simulation scale factors that depend on N (jets). The maximum size of these uncertainties varies between 8 and 10% for different decay modes.",

The new signal selection presented in this paper leads to the strengthening and further improvement of the results of ref. [12]. We now account for systematic uncertainties due to PDFs, and more thoroughly assess the effects of signal contamination. The combination with the dilepton search extends the sensitivity by \u223c25 GeV in the tt decay mode in the \u2206m m(t) region, and in the bbWW (x = 0.50) decay mode across the m( \u03c7 \u00b1 1 ) \u2212 m( \u03c7 0 1 ) = m(W) region; it very moderately extends the sensitivity in the bbWW (x = 0.75) at both high t 1 and \u03c7 0 1 masses; no gain of sensitivity is observed in the bbWW (x = 0.25) case where the search is limited by the small m( \u03c7 \u00b1 1 ) \u2212 m( \u03c7 0 1 ) mass difference, leaving a rather limited phase space to the decay products of the W boson. The signal contamination (see section 4.4) reduces the sensitivity of the search by 0-30 GeV depending on the decay mode and signal point under consideration.

The background determination method has also been improved compared to ref. [12]. In the dilepton search the signal selection is based on the M T2 variable.
