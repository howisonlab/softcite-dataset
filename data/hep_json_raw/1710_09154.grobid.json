            "text": "A search for new physics is carried out in events with at least three electrons or muons in any combination, jets, and missing transverse momentum. Results are based on the sample of proton-proton collision data produced by the LHC at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV and collected by the CMS experiment in 2016. The data sample analyzed corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 . Events are classified according to the number of b jets, missing transverse momentum, hadronic transverse momentum, and the invariant mass of same-flavor dilepton pairs with opposite charge. No significant excess above the expected standard model background is observed. Exclusion limits at 95% confidence level are computed for four different supersymmetric simplified models with pair production of gluinos or third-generation squarks. In the model with gluino pair production, with subsequent decays into a top quark-antiquark pair and a neutralino, gluinos with masses smaller than 1610 GeV are excluded for a massless lightest supersymmetric particle. In the case of bottom squark pair production, the bottom squark masses are excluded up to 840 GeV for charginos lighter than 200 GeV. For a simplified model of heavy top squark pair production, the t 2 mass is excluded up to 720, 780, or 710 GeV for models with an exclusive t 2 \u2192 t 1 H decay, an exclusive t 2 \u2192 t 1 Z decay, or an equally probable mix of those two decays. In order to provide a simplified version of the analysis for easier interpretation, a small set of aggregate signal regions also has been defined, providing a compromise between simplicity and analysis sensitivity.",

A sample of proton-proton (pp) collision data, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 and collected by the CMS detector at the CERN LHC at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV throughout 2016, is used. Results of this analysis are interpreted in the context of supersymmetric (SUSY) models [26][27][28][29][30][31][32][33][34]. Supersymmetry is an extension of the SM that predicts a SUSY partner for every SM particle by introducing a new symmetry between bosons and fermions. It can potentially provide solutions to questions left open by the SM, such as the hierarchy problem and the nature of dark matter. More specifically, models in which R-parity [31] is conserved, whereby SUSY particles are produced only in pairs, can include a dark matter candidate in the form of a stable and undetectable lightest SUSY particle (LSP). In the models considered in this paper, the LSP is assumed to be the lightest neutralino (a mixture of the superpartners of the Higgs and Z bosons, and of the photon).  Figure 1.

Throughout this paper lepton refers to an electron or a muon. The models under consideration in this analysis feature the pair production of gluinos, g, or third generation squarks, b 1 or t 2 , superpartners of gluons and third generation quarks, respectively, for a wide spectrum of possible masses. A typical process predicted by SUSY models consists of gluino pair production with each gluino decaying to a top quark pair, tt, and an LSP, \u03c7 0 1 (figure 1, upper left), or to a pair of quarks and a neutralino, \u03c7 0 2 , or chargino, \u03c7 \u00b1 1 . The latter would then decay into a Z or W boson, and an LSP (figure 1, upper right). The first model is referred to as T1tttt and the second one as T5qqqqVV throughout this paper. Other models feature bottom squark, b 1 , pair production, with subsequent cascade decays resulting in top quarks, W bosons and LSPs (figure 1, lower left) or pair production of the heaviest of the two top squark states, t 2 , with subsequent decays to top quarks, Higgs or Z bosons, and LSPs (figure 1, lower right). The latter process allows a challenging scenario to be probed in which the mass difference between the lighter top squark, t 1 , and the neutralino, \u03c7 0 1 , is close to the mass of the top quark [36,37]. These two models are denoted as T6ttWW and T6ttHZ, respectively. Through the decays of W, Z or Higgs bosons these processes can result in several leptons. In addition to the presence of multiple leptons, these models predict events with multiple jets and missing transverse momentum, largely induced by the undetected LSPs. The SUSY particles that are not directly included in the diagrams are assumed to be too heavy to be accessible at the LHC. Therefore, the only free parameters in these models are the mass of the produced gluinos or squarks, the masses of the possible intermediate particles in the decay chain, like \u03c7 0 2 or \u03c7 \u00b1 1 , and the mass of the \u03c7 0",

With the data sample collected by the ATLAS experiment and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb \u22121 , gluinos with masses up to 1870 GeV can be excluded [38] assuming the model depicted in figure 1 (upper left). A comparable search at the same center-of-mass energy with the CMS detector in 2015, based on a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.3 fb \u22121 , excluded gluino masses below 1175 GeV [39]. The current analysis improves upon the one performed with the data collected in 2015 with a more advanced strategy that exploits the transverse mass reconstructed with a lepton and the missing transverse momentum vector. Taking into account that approximately 15 times more data were collected in 2016, a new control region dominated by events from the ttZ process and a new interpretation of the results based on a T6ttHZ model also were added.",

            "text": "The CMS detector features a superconducting solenoid with an internal diameter of 6 m that creates a magnetic field of 3.8 T. Inside the magnet volume are a silicon pixel and strip tracker, an electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) made of lead tungstate crystals, and a hadronic calorimeter (HCAL) made of brass and scintillator material, each composed of a barrel and two endcap sections. Forward calorimeters extend the pseudorapidity (\u03b7) coverage for the HCAL. In the barrel section of the ECAL, an energy resolution of about 1% is achieved for unconverted or late-converting photons in the tens of GeV energy range. The remaining barrel photons have a resolution of about 1.3% up to |\u03b7| = 1, rising to about 2.5% at |\u03b7| = 1.4. In the endcaps, the resolution of unconverted or late-converting photons is about 2.5%, while the remaining endcap photons have a resolution between 3 and 4% [40]. When combining information from the entire detector, the jet energy resolution amounts typically to 15% at 10 GeV, 8% at 100 GeV, and 4% at 1 TeV, to be compared to about 40%, 12%, and 5% obtained when the ECAL and HCAL calorimeters alone are used. Muons are measured in the range |\u03b7| < 2.4, with detection planes made using three technologies: drift tubes, cathode strip chambers, and resistive plate chambers. Matching muons to tracks measured in the silicon tracker results in a relative transverse momentum resolution for muons with 20 < p T < 100 GeV of 1.3-2.0% in the barrel and better than 6% in the endcaps, The p T resolution in the barrel is better than 10% for muons with p T up to 1 TeV [41]. The first level of the CMS trigger system [42], composed of specialized hardware processors, uses information from the calorimeters and muon detectors to select the most interesting events in a fixed time interval of less than 4 \u00b5s. The high-level trigger (HLT) processor farm further decreases the event rate from approximately 100 kHz to around 1 kHz, before the storage of the data. A more detailed description of the CMS detector, together with a definition of the coordinate system used and the relevant kinematic variables, can be found in [43].",

The classification of selected events based on the number of b jets creates signal regions with high signal-to-background ratios for events from different signal models. For example, the T1tttt model features several b jets, which would be categorized into signal regions that are almost free of the leptonic WZ background owing to the b jet requirements. Including the 0 b jet signal regions keeps the analysis sensitive to signatures without b jets, such as T5qqqqVV model. Additionally, a categorization in H T and p miss T is useful to distinguish between compressed and noncompressed SUSY spectra, i.e. models with small or large mass differences between the SUSY particles in the decay chain. Table 2 shows the definition of the signal regions (SRs) into which the events passing the baseline selection are subdivided. There are 16 separate off-Z and 16 on-Z SRs.

These SRs are denoted as SR 1-12. Motivated by the low expected yield of events with high b jet multiplicities, one inclusive SR with p miss T < 300 GeV and H T < 600 GeV has been defined for \u22653 b jets (SR 13), and additionally to this three SRs with significant amounts of H T (>600 GeV, SRs 14, 15) or p miss T (>300 GeV, SR 16) have been introduced, since various noncompressed SUSY models yield very high values for these variables. These latter three regions are inclusive in the number of b jets. All of the 0 b jet regions, as well as three regions with high H T and p miss T values, are further split depending whether M T is smaller (designated with the letter \"a\" after the region number) or greater (designated with \"b\") than 120 GeV, leading to a total of 23 regions for each of the off-Z and on-Z categories. In the on-Z regions with 0 or 1 b jet and 60 < H T < 400 GeV, the p miss T lower bound is raised to 70 GeV to completely suppress the contribution from the Drell-Yan process.",

This definition leaves the p T of the leptons satisfying the tight isolation criteria unchanged and modifies the p T of those failing these criteria so that it is a better proxy for the mother parton p T and results in a smaller variation as a function of the mother parton p T . The flavor dependence, which is much more important for the case of electrons, is further reduced by adjusting the loose electron selection to obtain similar f values for nonprompt electrons that originate from light-or heavy-flavor jets.

The WZ control region is defined by the requirement of three leptons satisfying the nominal identification and isolation selections. Two leptons have to form an opposite charge, same flavor pair with |m \u2212 m Z | < 15 GeV, the number of jets and b jets has to be \u22641 and 0, respectively. The p miss T has to be in the range 30 < p miss T < 100 GeV, and M T is required to be at least 50 GeV to suppress contamination from the Drell-Yan process. The purity of the WZ control region is 80%. The orthogonal control region for ttZ is defined similarly to that for WZ, except for a requirement on the number of jets: three leptons satisfying the nominal identification and isolation selection are to be found, two of them forming an opposite charge, same flavor pair with |m \u2212 m Z | < 15 GeV, at least 3 jets, and 30 < p miss T < 50 GeV.

The overall purity of the ttZ process is 20%, increasing to 50% in the bins with at least one b jet. These three bins, together with the WZ control region are used in a simultaneous fit to obtain the scale factors for the normalization of the simulated samples. In the fit to data, the normalization and relative population across all four bins of all the components are allowed to vary according to experimental and theoretical uncertainties. For the WZ process the obtained scale factor is compatible with unity, 1.01 \u00b1 0.07, and no correction is applied to the simulation, while for the ttZ it is found to be 1.14 \u00b1 0.28.

            "text": "The limits are shown in figure 5 for the T1tttt model (left) and for the T5qqqqVV model (right). In the T5qqqqVV model each gluino decays to a pair of light quarks and a neutralino ( \u03c7 0 2 ) or chargino ( \u03c7 \u00b1 1 ), followed by the decay of that neutralino or chargino to a W or Z boson, respectively, and an LSP ( figure 1, top right). The probability for the decay to proceed via the \u03c7 + 1 , \u03c7 \u2212 1 , or \u03c7 0 2 is taken to be 1/3 for each case. In this scenario, the second neutralino \u03c7 0 2 and chargino are assumed to be mass-degenerate, with masses equal to 0.5(m g + m \u03c7 0 1 ). The limits on the bottom squark pair production cross section are shown in figure 6. In this model, the mass of the LSP is set to 50 GeV. Finally, the limits on the t 2 pair production cross section are shown in figure 7. In this scenario, the mass difference between the t 1 and the LSP is set to 175 GeV, the t 1 decays via a top quark to LSP, and the t 2 decays via a Z or Higgs boson to t 1 . We consider the reference values B( t 2 \u2192 t 1 Z) = 0, 50, and 100%; the sensitivity is diminished for the t 1 H final state because of the additional branching factors for Higgs cascade decays to electrons or muons via gauge bosons or tau leptons.   Search regions providing the best sensitivity to new physics scenarios depend on the considered models and their parameters. In the non-compressed scenario of the T1tttt model, the most sensitive region is off-Z SR16b (high p miss T and M T region). When considering the compressed scenario, the contribution from SR16b region remains the largest, up to the most compressed cases where the SR12 off-Z region (2 b jets, medium p miss T and high H T ) starts to contribute significantly. For the T5qqqqVV model in the non-compressed scenario, the most sensitive regions are on-Z SR16b and SR15b (high and medium p miss T , high H T and high M T values). When moving towards more compressed scenarios, the most significant contributions come from the SR16b and SR15b on-Z regions, until reaching the compressed scenario where the most sensitive region is SR4b (medium p miss T , high H T and high M T ). The exclusion limit for T6ttWW model is dominated by both off-Z SR16 regions (high p miss T region). For the T6ttHZ model with B( t 2 \u2192 t 1 Z) = 0%, the limits in the non-compressed scenario are driven by the off-Z SR15a (high H T , medium p miss T , low M T ), while for compressed case by off-Z SR13 (high N b jets , low and medium H T and p miss T ). For B( t 2 \u2192 t 1 Z) = 50% in the non-compressed scenario, the on-Z SR16b region dominates the exclusion limit, while in the compressed scenario the on-Z SR13 (high N b jets ) and SR15b (high H T , medium p miss T , high M T ) give the highest contribution. Finally, for B( t 2 \u2192 t 1 Z) = 100% the on-Z SR16b plays the leading role in both compressed and non-compressed scenarios.       Figure 7. Cross section upper limits at 95% CL in the m t1 versus m t2 plane for T6ttHZ simplified model. Different branching fractions of the decay t 2 \u2192 t 1 Z are considered: 0% (top left), 50% (top right), and 100% (bottom). The mass difference between the lighter top squark ( t 1 ) and a neutralino is close to the mass of the top quark. The descriptions of the excluded regions and color scale are the same as in figure 5.",

The analysis makes use of control regions in data to estimate reducible backgrounds and to validate simulations used to estimate irreducible background processes. To maximize sensitivity to a broad range of possible signal models, 46 exclusive signal regions are defined.
