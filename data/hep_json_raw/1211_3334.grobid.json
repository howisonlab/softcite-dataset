Evidence for this energy loss was first experimentally established through observation of high-p T hadron suppression at RHIC. More recently, measurements of fully reconstructed jets have been performed at the LHC. In this summary the latest experimental results from the ATLAS collaboration on jet suppression are presented. In particular the jet suppression in inclusive jet yields, path length dependence of the jet suppression, photon-jet and Z 0 -jet correlations, heavy flavor suppression, and jet fragmentation are discussed. These results establish qualitative features of the jet quenching mechanism as experimental fact and provide constraints on models of jet energy loss.",

Jets produced in hard scattering are expected to be modified due to the energy loss of outgoing parton traversing the hot QCD medium. This effect is commonly referred to as a jet quenching. Jets therefore represent an important tool for studying both the properties of the deconfined matter and the parton energy loss [1]. In this paper we will provide a status report on jet measurements performed using the 2010 and 2011 Pb+Pb data at \u221a s NN = 2.76 TeVcollected by the ATLAS detector [2].",

In central heavy ion collisions an excess of events with large di-jet asymmetry has been observed when compared to p+p or Pb+Pb Monte Carlo (MC) reference. This asymmetry has been accompanied by a balance in azimuth, that is jets in the di-jet system remain \"back-to-back\" despite to a sizable modification of their energy. This measurement is an observation measurement and by itself it is insufficient to provide detailed information about the parton energy loss. To gain more information we need to ask more detailed questions: We need to know how does the modification of the inclusive jet spectra depend on the jet p T , jet size, or direction of the jet with respect to the reaction plane. We also need to know whether the suppression depends on the flavor of the initial parton. Last but not least we should learn how is the internal structure of jets modified. These questions will be addressed in the sections 4-7. Section 2 summarizes the event selection and centrality definition, section 3 discusses the jet reconstruction performance. 1 A list of members of the ATLAS Collaboration and acknowledgements can be found at the end of this issue.",

Minimum bias Pb+Pb collisions were identified using measurements from the zerodegree calorimeters (ZDCs) and the minimum-bias trigger scintillator (MBTS) counters 2 . In the offline analysis, events were required to have a primary vertex reconstructed from charged particle tracks with p T > 500 MeV. The 2010 data-taking used only the minimum bias trigger whereas the in the 2011 run, events were selected for recording using a combination of the minimum bias trigger and high-level trigger (HLT). The HLT triggered on jets, high-p T photons, electrons, and muons. The centrality of each heavy ion collision is determined using the sum of the transverse energy in all cells in the forward calorimeter (3.1 < |\u03b7| < 4.9), at the electromagnetic scale. The average number of nucleon-nucleon collisions, N coll , and the average number of participating nucleons, N part , were calculated using the standard MC Glauber model [4].",

A good consistency between the results of the fluctuation analysis and the parametrization of the JER has been achieved. Simultaneously, a good agreement between the fluctuations in the data and HIJING has been observed. The jet reconstruction efficiency decreases with decreasing jet E T for E T 50 GeV. The decrease starts at larger E T and decreases more rapidly for larger jet radii and in more central collisions. An independent check of the basic performance has been done by using PYTHIA jets embedded directly to the minimum bias data. The reconstruction efficiency was found to differ between central and peripheral collisions by less then 5% on the rise of the efficiency curve for R = 0.4 jets and the agreement in the JES was found to be better then a 1% between central and peripheral collisions.

Since photons and vector bosons are insensitive to the colored medium they can provide means to calibrate the expected energy of quenched jet in a photon-jet system or in a Z 0 -jet system. The quenching of the jet in the photon-jet sample can be quantified by measuring the jet to photon energy ratio, x J\u03b3 = p T jet /p T \u03b3 . The left panel of Figure 4 shows the integrated per-photon jet yield, R J\u03b3 , evaluated as a function of the number of participants for data and MC. A clear suppression of the jet yield is seen in central compared to peripheral collisions. The measurement is performed for two different jet sizes, R = 0.2 and R = 0.3 providing the same result within the systematic uncertainties. Qualitatively the same result has been obtained also from the Z 0 -jet correlation measurements in which the Z 0 have been identified from the e + e \u2212 and \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 decays. The same trend in the evolution of the jet suppression as a function of centrality has been observed despite to the limited statistics of less then forty Z 0 -jet events. These results provide a starting point for precision measurements of the jet quenching which will be allowed by future high luminosity heavy ion runs at LHC. More details on \u03b3-jet correlations are provided in Ref. [15], details on Z 0 -jet correlations are provided in Ref.",

The measurement was performed over the muon transverse momentum range 4 < p T < 14 GeV. Over this p T range, muon production results predominantly from a combination of charm and bottom quark semi-leptonic decays. The differential yield of muons in a given centrality and p T bin was compared to that in a peripheral bin through the central-to-peripheral ratio, R CP . The right panel of Figure 4 shows a comparison of the muon R CP as a function of centrality for four different p T intervals. One can see a smooth decrease in the R CP with increasing centrality. The suppression does not change with the muon p T while the size of the suppression changes by nearly a factor of two between the most central and the most peripheral bins. A similar size of suppression between the yields of muons from semi-leptonic heavy quark decays and inclusive jet yields together with the R CP of muons being rather flat a as a function of p T suggests no dramatic difference between the light and heavy quark response to the medium.

The fraction of prompt muons was estimated using template fits to the distribution of a quantity capable of distinguishing statistically between signal and background. The pT spectra of signal muons were evaluated in five centrality bins: 0-10%, 10-20%, 20-40%, 40-60%, and 60-80%. The centrality dependence of muon production was characterized using the central-to-peripheral ratio, RCP, calculated using the 60-80% centrality bin as a peripheral reference. The results for RCP indicate a factor of about 2. The picture of the jet fragmentation at high-p T is consistent with both the inclusive jet suppression and suppression of single charged particles reported in Ref. [19]. The charged particle R CP achieves a value of \u2248 0.6, that is a similar value as the R CP of inclusive jets. Since the R CP of inclusive jets is rather flat as a function jet p T and since all the measured charged particles at high-p T should be also measured in jets we can expect no significant modification of yields of high-p T fragments between central and peripheral collisions. This is indeed seen in the measurement of the jet fragmentation.",

We find that the inclusive jet yields are suppressed by approximately a factor of two in central compared to peripheral collisions. This suppression has only a weak dependence on the jet p T . A significant dependence of the jet suppression on the jet size is seenwith increasing jet radius the suppression is weaker. The jet suppression depends on the direction of the jet with respect to elliptic flow event plane. A maximal difference of \u2248 15% in the jet yields for jets produced in plane compared to jets produced perpendicular to the elliptic flow plane is observed. The jet suppression is also observed in \u03b3-jet and Z 0 -jet systems. The measurement of semi-leptonic decays of open heavy flavor hadrons to muons suggests a similar suppression of heavy quark jets and light quark jets. The jet fragmentation function and momentum spectra of charged particles produced inside jets are modified in central compared to peripheral collisions. The yield of low-z fragments is enhanced whereas the yield of intermediate z fragments is suppressed. No sizable difference of high-z fragments is seen.",

The kinematic cuts are:photon 60 < p T \u03b3 < GeV, |\u03b7 \u03b3 | < 1.3, p T jet > 25 GeV, |\u03b7 jet | < 2.1. The azimuthal distance between jet and photon is required to be |\u2206\u03c6 J\u03b3 | > 7\u03c0/8. The error bars represent statistical errors, while the gray bands indicate the systematic uncertainties [15], [16]. Right: Muon R CP as a function of N part calculated for different bins in muon p T . The sets of points for the different p T bins are successively displaced by \u2206N part = 6 for clarity of presentation. The error bars represent combined statistical and systematic uncertainties [17].",
