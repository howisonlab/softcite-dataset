The correlation between the top and antitop quark spins is extracted from dilepton tt events by using the difference in the azimuthal angle between the two charged leptons in the laboratory frame. In the helicity basis the measured degree of correlation corresponds to A helicity \u00bc 0.38 AE 0.04, in agreement with the standard model prediction. A search is performed for pair production of top squarks with masses close to the top quark mass decaying to predominantly right-handed top quarks and a light neutralino, the lightest supersymmetric particle. Top squarks with masses between the top quark mass and 191 GeV are excluded at the 95% confidence level.",

            "text": "Detailed studies of the correlation of the spin of top and antitop quarks in tt events produced at hadron colliders are of great interest; they provide important precision tests of the predictions of the standard model (SM) and are sensitive to many new physics scenarios [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16]. The orientations of the top and antitop quark spins are transferred to the decay products and can be measured directly via their angular distributions [3,17,[17][18][19][20][21][22][23][24][25][26][27][28][29][30][31][32][33][34][35][36]. The strength of their correlation has been studied previously by the CDF and D0 collaborations in proton-antiproton scattering at 1.98 TeV [37][38][39][40] and by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations in proton-proton scattering at 7 TeV [41][42][43].",

Models with light top squarks are particularly attractive since they provide a solution to the hierarchy problem [46][47][48][49]. In such models, the mass m~t 1 of the lighter top squark mass eigenstatet 1 could be close to the mass of the top quark m t [50,51]. If the lightest SUSY particle, the neutralino\u03c7 0 1 (or alternatively the gravitino), is light and the top squark mass is only slightly larger than the top quark mass, two-body decayst 1 \u2192 t\u03c7 0 1 in which the momentum of\u03c7 0 1 is very small can predominate [16]. The masses of all other SUSY particles are assumed to be large. In SUSY models where R parity is conserved, such as the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) [52][53][54][55][56], this could lead to tt\u03c7 0 1\u03c7 0 1 intermediate states, appearing like SM tt production with additional missing transverse momentum carried away by the escaping neutralinos, making traditional searches exploiting kinematic differences as presented in Refs. [57][58][59][60][61][62][63] very difficult.t 1t1 events can be distinguished from SM tt events through an increase of the measured tt cross section as analyzed in Ref. [64], and since top squarks have zero spin, through measuring angular correlations sensitive to spin correlation, as analyzed in this Letter.",

The CTEQ6L1 PDF set [78] is used, and the cross section is normalized to the next-to-next-toleading-order (NNLO) QCD prediction [79]. Parton showering and fragmentation are modeled by HERWIG, and multiparton interactions are simulated by JIMMY [80]. The \"MLM\" parton-jet matching scheme [81] is employed.

Figure 1 shows the reconstructed \u0394\u03d5 distribution for the sum of the three dilepton channels. A binned log-likelihood fit is used to extract the spin correlation from the \u0394\u03d5 distribution in data. This is done by defining a coefficient f SM that measures the degree of spin correlation relative to the SM prediction. The fit includes a linear superposition of the \u0394\u03d5 distribution from the SM tt MC simulation with coefficient f SM , and from the tt simulation without spin correlation with coefficient \u00f01 \u2212 f SM \u00de. The e \u00fe e \u2212 , \u03bc \u00fe \u03bc \u2212 and e AE \u03bc \u2213 channels are fitted simultaneously with a common value of f SM , leaving the tt normalization free with a fixed background normalization. The tt normalization obtained by the fit agrees with the theoretical prediction of the production cross section [71] within the uncertainties. Negative values of f SM correspond to an anticorrelation of the top and antitop quark spins. A value of f SM \u00bc 0 implies that the spins are uncorrelated and values of f SM > 1 indicate a degree of tt spin correlation larger than predicted by the SM.",

The uncertainty due to the parton shower and hadronization model is determined by comparing two tt samples generated by ALPGEN, one interfaced with PYTHIA and the other one interfaced with HERWIG. The uncertainty on the amount of initial-and final-state radiation (ISR and FSR) in the simulated tt sample is assessed by comparing ALPGEN events, showered with PYTHIA, with varied amounts of ISR and FSR. As in Ref. [42], the size of the variation is compatible with the recent measurements of additional jet activity in tt events [103]. The Wt normalization is varied within the theoretical uncertainties of the cross-section calculation [86], and the sensitivity to the interference between Wt production and tt production at NLO is studied by comparing the predictions of POWHEG-BOX with the Observed 60424 ",

[64] and to top squark masses lower than limits from analyses exploring kinematic distributions as presented in Ref. [61]. In conclusion, the first measurement of tt spin correlation in proton-proton scattering at a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV at the LHC has been presented using 20.3 fb \u22121 of ATLAS data in the dilepton decay topology. A template fit is performed to the \u0394\u03d5 distribution and the measured value of f SM \u00bc 1.20 AE 0.05\u00f0stat\u00de AE 0.13\u00f0syst\u00de is consistent with the SM prediction. This represents the most precise measurement to date. The results have been used to search for pair-produced supersymmetric top squarks decaying to top quarks and light neutralinos. Assuming 100% branching ratio for the decayt 1 \u2192 t\u03c7 0 1 , and the production of predominantly right-handed top quarks, top squark masses between the top quark mass and 191 GeV are excluded at 95% C.L., which is an improvement over previous constraints.",
