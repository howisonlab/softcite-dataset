Hadron collisions at these energies provide an opportunity to probe quantum chromodynamics (QCD) under extreme conditions. The distinguishing feature of QCD is the mechanism of color confinement, the physics of which is not fully understood, due in part to its theoretical intractability [2]. The confinement mechanism has a physical scale on the order of the proton radius and is especially important at low momentum.",

            "text": "Bose-Einstein enhancement of identical-pion pairs at low relative momentum was first observed in p \" p collisions by Goldhaber, Goldhaber, Lee, and Pais 50 years ago [3]. Since then, two-pion correlations have been successfully applied to assess the spatial scale of the emitting source in e \u00fe e \u00c0 [4], hadron-hadron and lepton-hadron [5], and heavy-ion [6] collisions. Especially in the latter case, this technique, known as Hanbury Brown-Twiss (HBT) interferometry [7,8] and being a special case of femtoscopy [9,10], has been developed into a precision tool to probe the dynamically generated geometry of the emitting system. In particular, a first order phase transition between the colordeconfined and -confined states was precluded by the observation of short time scales [6]. At the same time, femtoscopic measurement of bulk collective flow, manifesting itself via dynamical dependences of femtoscopic scales (''homogeneity lengths'' [11,12]), provided hints that a strongly self-interacting system was created in the collision. This was further corroborated by the positive correlation between the HBT radius and the multiplicity of the event [6].",

Within this sample, we have selected events based on the measured charged-particle multiplicity M. The three multiplicity classes were M 6, 7 M 11, and M ! 12; about 70% of all events were falling into the first multiplicity class. The tracks used in determining the multiplicity were the same as those used for correlation analysis (see below) except that particle identification cuts were not applied. The measured multiplicity was converted to the charged-particle pseudorapidity density dN ch =d by normalizing it to the pseudorapidity acceptance and by correcting it for the reconstruction efficiency and contamination. The correction factor was determined from a Monte Carlo simulation with the PHOJET event generator [18,19] and with the full description of the ALICE apparatus and is 0.71, 0.78, and 0.81, respectively, for the three multiplicity bins.

            "text": "The ALICE TPC [17] was used to record chargedparticle tracks as they leave ionization trails in the Ne \u00c0 CO 2 \u00c0 N 2 gas. The ionization electrons drift up to 2.5 m to be measured on 159 pad rows; the position resolution is better than 2 mm. Combined with a solenoidal magnetic field of B \u00bc 0:5 T this leads to a momentum resolution $1% for pions with p T < 1 GeV=c. The ALICE inner tracking system (ITS) has also been used for tracking. It consists of six silicon layers, two innermost pixel detectors, two layers of drift detectors, and two outer layers of strip detectors, which provide up to six space points for each track. The tracks used in this analysis were reconstructed using the information from both the TPC (signals from at least 90 pad rows required) and the ITS. Separate studies have been done with TPC-only and ITS-only tracks, and were found to give results consistent with the combined ITS \u00fe TPC analysis. The tracks were required to project back to the primary interaction vertex within 0.2 cm (2.4 cm) in the transverse plane and 0.25 cm (3.2 cm) in the longitudinal direction, if ITS \u00fe TPC (TPC-only) information is used, thereby rejecting most secondary pions from weak decays. The pion tracks used in the correlation analysis had transverse momenta between 0:15 GeV=c and 1:0 GeV=c. ALICE provides excellent particle identification capability. In this analysis the particle identification was achieved by correlating the magnetic rigidity of a track with its specific ionization (dE=dx) in the TPC gas. The dE=dx of the TPC was calibrated using cosmic rays and its resolution was shown to be better than 5.5%, the design value. The contamination of the pion sample is negligible within the momentum range of 0:25 GeV=c < p < 0:65 GeV=c. Below and above this range it is on the order of 5% and is caused by electrons and kaons, respectively.",

The multiplicity binning improved the flatness of the correlation function at q inv > 1:5 GeV=c. Binning events according to their vertex position, on the other hand, had no effect on the correlation function and therefore was not used. Alternatively to event mixing, the denominator can be obtained by rotating one of the two tracks by 180 in azimuth.

Momentum smearing for single particles has a similar effect on the correlation structures in two-particle correlations, i.e., it smears the correlation peak, making it appear lower and wider. We have studied this effect with the Monte-Carlo simulation of the ALICE detector and have found that for the width of the correlation peak expected here the effect is on the order of 1%. Figure 1 presents two-pion correlation functions measured by ALICE in pp collisions at ffiffi ffi s p \u00bc 900 GeV, as a function of event multiplicity and transverse momentum k T . The denominator of the correlation function was obtained via event mixing and normalized such that the numbers of true and mixed pairs with 0:4 GeV=c < q inv < 0:6 GeV=c were equal. The q inv range used for normalization was chosen to be outside of the Bose-Einstein peak but as close as possible to it. The normalized distributions of positive and negative pion pairs were added together before building the ratio of true and mixed pairs. The Bose-Einstein enhancement is manifest at low q inv . A slight decrease of the correlation peak width is seen as multiplicity grows. The k T dependence is less obvious because the correlation baseline-the underlying two-particle correlation without any Bose-Einstein enhancement-is systematically changing its shape between the low and high transverse momenta. The correlation functions were fitted by a function accounting for the Bose-Einstein enhancement and for the mutual Coulomb interaction between the two particles:",

In order to better understand the shape of the correlation baseline we have calculated correlation functions for pp collisions events generated by the model PHOJET and propagated through the ALICE detectors, performing an identical analysis for the simulated events as for the measured ones. The results are shown as open circles in Fig. 1. The model does not contain the Bose-Einstein effect, hence the lack of the peak at low q inv is expected. At low k T and low multiplicity, the model predicts a flat correlation function.

            "text": "An increase of the HBT radius with multiplicity is observed, consistent with the hadron-hadron collision systematics above ffiffi ffi s p $ 50 GeV [13]. While the average transverse momentum is similar in all four data sets, other aspects of the analysis, e.g., the average orientation of the momentum difference vector, can differ so the trends, not the absolute values, should be compared. In heavy-ion collisions, this multiplicity dependence has been associated with the particle composition and overall volume of the final-state system [6,26,27] or with final-state hadronic rescattering [28]. The relation observed in heavy-ion collision data [6], R $ a \u00fe b\u00f0dN ch =d\u00de 1=3 , where a and b are constants, appears to be consistent with our data within our systematic errors. For high-energy pp collisions, it has been suggested that a similar behavior could originate from final-state hadronic rescattering for short hadronization times [29]. In an alternative scenario, the increase of the HBT radius with multiplicity results from the fact that the high multiplicity pp events mostly come from hard parton scattering, and the hadronization length, i.e., the distance travelled by a parton before hadronization, is roughly proportional to the parton energy [30]. The fitted correlation strength is lower than unity, the value expected for the ideal Bose-Einstein case. One reason for this is the non-Gaussian shape of the peak, caused at least partially by pions from decays of short-(\u00c1, ) and long-lived resonances (!, , 0 ). On the detector side, can be reduced by the particle misidentification; this effect is, however, small in our data sample. In ALICE, decreases from 0:37 AE 0:03 to 0:32 AE 0:03 between the lowest and the highest multiplicity, in close agreement with the E735 measurements at Tevatron [25]. A similar trend was observed by UA1 in p \" p collisions at ffiffi ffi s p \u00bc 630 GeV=c [31]; the fact that their values were lower may have to do with the lack of the particle identification and the resulting dilution of the correlation peak. In a final-state hadronic rescattering model [29], a correlation strength dropping with multiplicity in high-energy pp collisions was attributed to the increased contribution from long-lived resonances in higher multiplicity events.",

Taking the baseline shape from the Monte Carlo leads to an HBT radius that is nearly independent of k T (filled black circles and red boxes for PHOJET and PYTHIA, respectively). Assuming a flat baseline, on the other hand, results in a radius falling with k T (green stars).

As with the multiplicity dependence, the systematic error band represents a quadratic sum of the error related to the baseline assumption (0-10%), the fit range (10%), and the denominator construction method (mixing/rotating, 7-17%). The lowest-k T point is significantly below the RHIC and TABLE II. One-dimensional HBT radius in pp collisions at ffiffi ffi s p \u00bc 900 GeV determined using pion pairs with k T \u00bc 0:1-0:55 GeV=c, hk T i \u00bc 0:32 GeV=c, as a function of the charged-particle pseudorapidity density at midrapidity. The radii were obtained using the exponential fit function defined by Eq. 3. Tevatron results. It should be noted that the ALICE analysis was performed on a minimum-bias event sample and the averaged charged-particle pseudorapidity density is hdN ch =di \u00bc 3:6 while the Tevatron events are biased to high multiplicity, hdN ch =di \u00bc 14:4, similar to our highest multiplicity bin. As visible in Fig. 3, the lowest-k T point at the high multiplicity is at R inv % 1:2 fm, approaching the Tevatron points. The STAR results, on the other hand, were obtained from events with hdN ch =di \u00bc 4:3, i.e., similar to the ALICE case and thus a similar reasoning cannot explain the difference. Two tests were performed to make sure that the low HBT radius value at low transverse momenta is not caused by apparatus effects. First, the analysis was repeated using only the ITS and thus reducing the low-momentum cutoff by about 50 MeV=c. This analysis yielded the same HBT radius which demonstrates that the energy loss is not an issue. Second, as seen in Fig. 3 the low-k T point is mostly driven down by the contribution of the low-multiplicity events. Since the vertex resolution in these events is worse this might in principle deteriorate the momentum resolution and smear out the correlation function peak. In order to test this, the analysis was performed without using the event vertex constraint for momentum determination. The results, again, were unchanged. This, and the distinct K 0 S peak in the unlike-sign pion correlation functions in the low-multiplicity low-k T bin of Fig. 2, indicate that the momentum resolution is not spoiled in low-multiplicity events. Even more important than the position of the first point, albeit related to it, is the question of the slope of the points in Fig. 6. Our measured HBT radius is practically independent of k T within the studied transverse momentum range. The slope crucially depends on the baseline shape assumption, as was shown in Fig. 5. The results from the experiments to which we are comparing in Fig. 6 were extracted using a flat background (although the STAR experiment also studied the effects of using other types of backgrounds for their data to account for the nonfemtoscopic effects [14]). Assuming that PHOJET and PYTHIA are correct such a procedure may lead to a misinterpretation of the low-q enhancement of the correlation function, that is coming from long-range correlations (most probably minijet like), as a Bose-Einstein enhancement. As the impact of this may depend on the details of each experiment (certainly on the collision energy) we do not attempt to resolve this question quantitatively. However, we stress again the usefulness of nonidentical-pion correlation in constraining the correlation baseline.",
