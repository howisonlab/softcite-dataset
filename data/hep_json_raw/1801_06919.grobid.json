The experiment provides a scan of measurements of particle spectra and fluctuations in proton-proton, proton-nucleus, and nucleus-nucleus interactions as functions of collision energy and system size, corresponding to a two-dimensional phase diagram (T-\u00b5 B ). New NA61/SHINE results are shown here, including transverse momentum and multiplicity fluctuations in Ar+Sc collisions as compared to NA61 p+p and Be+Be data, as well earlier NA49 A+A results. Recently, a preliminary effect of change in the system size dependence, labelled as the \"percolation threshold\" or the \"onset of fireball\", was observed in NA61/SHINE data. This effect is closely related to the vicinity of the hadronic phase space transition region and will be discussed in the text.",

            "text": "As seen in Figure 3, the phase structure of hadronic matter is involved. Progress in the theoretical understanding of the subject and the collection of more experimental data will allow us to delve further into the subject. While the highest energies achieved at the LHC and RHIC colliders provide data related to the crossover HG/QGP regions, the SPS fixed-target NA61/SHINE experiment is particularly suited to exploring the phase transition line of HG/QGP with the CR included. Heavy ion collision (HIC) experiments reproduce the conditions of the first 10 \u00b5s after the Big Bang, when a phase transition from the QGP to a hadron gas would have taken place [7]. It appears, however, that the QGP can be present in the core of massive neutron stars-particularly those with masses exceeding two solar masses [8,9]. That would correspond to the far lower right part of the phase plot, beyond the (T, \u00b5 B ) range covered by Figure 3. The CR has been long predicted for thermal quantum chromodynamics (QCDs) at finite \u00b5 B /T [10][11][12] although this was not unanimously accepted previously [13]. However, lattice QCD calculations are becoming more and more accurate, leading to the present conclusions that the cross-over region occurs at T c (\u00b5 B = 0) = 154 \u00b1 9 MeV [14] and the location of a CR is not expected for \u00b5 B /T 2 and T/T c (\u00b5 B = 0) > 0.9 [15]. A more detailed exploration of QCD phase diagram would need both new experimental data with extended detection capabilities and improved theoretical models [16].",

In the standard approach, the Big Bang QGP is almost matter-antimatter symmetric and evolves to lower temperatures through the crossover region almost vertically to the temperature axis [18]. Edward Witten, using almost \"back of envelope\" arguments, pointed out the possibility of using the path of universe starting in the QGP phase from the high baryonic chemical potential region reaching almost zeroth temperature, with supercooled QGP. Hadronization then becomes quite an explosive phenomena with a necessary subsequent reheating (see e.g., [19,20]). Corresponding plots, taken from [19], are shown in Figure 4.  Beyond cosmological effects (little/tepid inflation) such a possibility would change also our understanding of the hadronization effect in HIC processes.",
