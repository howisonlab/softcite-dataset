The CP asymmetry in the decay is measured to be (\u22120.363 \u00b1 0.094 \u00b1 0.067)%, which is 3.2 standard deviations away from zero, and is consistent with the expected CP violation due to the neutral kaon in the final state.",

In the SM, CP violation in the charm sector is expected to be very small, O(0.1%) or below [2]. Since the discovery of the J/\u03c8 [3] and the subsequent discovery of open charm particles [4], CP violation in charmed particle decays has been searched for extensively and only recently became experimentally accessible. To date, after the FO-CUS [5], CLEO [6], Belle [7], and BaBar [8] measurements, the world average of the CP asymmetry in the decay D + \u2192 K 0 S \u03c0 + [9] is (\u22120.54 \u00b1 0.14)%, which is the first evidence of CP violation in charmed particles. However, it should be noted that the observed asymmetry is consistent with that expected due to the neutral kaon in the final state and is not ascribed to the charm sector. Recently, LHCb reported \u2206A CP = (\u22120.82 \u00b1 0.21 \u00b1 0.11)%, where \u2206A CP is the CP asymmetry difference between D 0 \u2192 K + K \u2212 and D 0 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decays [10]. This is the first evidence of non-zero \u2206A CP in charmed particle decays from a single experiment.",

The observed K 0 S \u03c0 + final state is a coherent sum of amplitudes for D + \u2192K 0 \u03c0 + and D + \u2192 K 0 \u03c0 + decays where the former is Cabibbo-favored (CF) and the latter is doubly Cabibbo-suppressed (DCS). In the absence of direct CP violation in CF and DCS decays (as expected within the SM), the CP asymmetry in D + \u2192 K 0 S \u03c0 + decay within the SM is AK 0 CP , which is measured to be (\u22120.332 \u00b1 0.006)% [14] from K 0 L semileptonic decays [15]. On the other hand, if processes beyond the SM contain additional weak phases other than the one in the Kobayashi-Maskawa ansatz [1], interference between CF and DCS decays could generate an O(1%) direct CP asymmetry in the decay D + \u2192 K 0 S \u03c0 + [13]. Thus, observation of A CP inconsistent with AK 0 CP in D + \u2192 K 0 S \u03c0 + decay would be strong evidence for processes involving new physics [13,16].",

We form K 0 S candidates from \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 pairs, fitted to a common vertex and requiring the invariant mass of the pair M (\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) to be within [0.4826, 0.5126] GeV/c 2 , regardless of whether the candidate satisfies the standard K 0 S requirements [22] (we refer to the K 0 S candidates not satisfying the standard criteria as \"loose K 0 S \"). The K 0 S and \u03c0 + candidates are combined to form a D + candidate by fitting them to a common vertex and the D + candidate is fitted to the e + e \u2212 interaction point to give the production vertex. To remove combinatorial background as well as D + mesons, which are produced in possibly CP violating B meson decays, we require the D + meson momentum calculated in the CMS (p * D + ) to be greater than 2.5 and 3.0 GeV/c for the data taken at the \u03a5(4S) and \u03a5(5S) resonances, respectively. For the data taken below \u03a5(4S), which is free of B mesons, we apply the requirement p * D + >2.0 GeV/c. In addition to the selections described above, we further optimize the signal sensitivity with four variables: the \u03c7 2 of the D + decay and production vertex fits (\u03c7 2 D and \u03c7 2 P ), the transverse momentum of the \u03c0 + (p T \u03c0 + ), and the angle between the D + momentum vector, as reconstructed from the daughters, and the vector joining the D + production and decay vertices (\u03be) [24]. An optimization is performed by maximizing N S / \u221a N S + N B with the four variables varied simultaneously [25], where N S + N B and N B are the yields in the K 0 S \u03c0 + invariant mass signal ([1.855, 1.885] GeV/c 2 ) and sideband ([1.825, 1.840] and [1.900, 1.915] GeV/c 2 ) regions, respectively. The optimal set of (\u03c7 2 D , \u03c7 2 P , p T \u03c0 + , \u03be) requirements are found to be (<100, <10, >0.50 GeV/c, <160 \u2022 ), (<100, <10, >0.45 GeV/c, <170 \u2022 ), and (<100, <10, >0.40 GeV/c, no requirement) for the data taken below the \u03a5(4S), at the \u03a5(4S), and at the \u03a5(5S), respectively. The D + candidates with the loose K 0 S requirement are further optimized with two additional variables which are the \u03c7 2 of the fit of pions from the K 0 S decay and the pion from the D + meson decay to a single vertex (\u03c7 2 3\u03c0 ), and the an-gle between the K 0 S momentum vector, as reconstructed from the daughters, and the vector joining the D + and K 0 S decay vertices (\u03b6). The two variables are again varied simultaneously and the optimum is found to be \u03c7 2 3\u03c0 >6 and \u03b6<4 \u2022 for all data. The inclusion of D + candidates with the loose K 0 S requirement improves the statistical sensitivity by approximately 5%. After the final selections described above, there remains a background with a broad peaking structure in the K 0 S \u03c0 + invariant mass signal region, due to misidentification of charged kaons from D + s \u2192 K 0 S K + decays. The D + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + background is found to be negligible from simulation [26]. Figure 1 shows the distributions of M (K 0 S \u03c0 + ) and M (K 0 S \u03c0 \u2212 ) together with the results of the fits described below. The D \u00b1 \u2192 K 0 S \u03c0 \u00b1 signals are parameterized as a sum of a Gaussian and a bifurcated Gaussian distribution with a common mean. The combinatorial background is parameterized with the form e \u03b1+\u03b2M(K 0 S \u03c0 \u00b1 ) , where \u03b1 and \u03b2 are free parameters. The shapes and normalizations of the D \u00b1 s \u2192 K 0 S K \u00b1 misidentification backgrounds are obtained with taking the asymmetry in D \u00b1 s \u2192 K 0 S K \u00b1 into account as described in Refs. [7,22]. Both the shapes and the normalizations of the misidentification backgrounds are fixed in the fit. The asymmetry and the sum of the D + and D \u2212 yields are directly obtained from a simultaneous fit to the D + and D \u2212 candidate distributions. Be-sides the asymmetry and the total signal yield, the common parameters in the simultaneous fit are the widths of the Gaussian and the bifurcated Gaussian and the ratio of their amplitudes. The asymmetry and the sum of the D + and D \u2212 yields from the fit are (\u22120.146\u00b10.094)% and (1738\u00b12)\u00d710 3 , respectively, where the errors are statistical. To obtain A \u03c0 + \u01eb we first extract A D 0 \u2192K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 0 rec from a simultaneous fit with the same parameterizations for the signal except for the misidentification background. The values of A D 0 \u2192K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 0 rec are evaluated in 4\u00d74\u00d74\u00d74\u00d74 bins of the five-dimensional (5D) phase space (",
