            "text": "The recently discovered particle with mass close to 125 GeV [1][2][3] has been shown to have properties that are consistent with those of a standard model (SM) Higgs boson [4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14]. Supersymmetric (SUSY) extensions of the SM [15,16] also predict a particle with such properties and resolve some problems of the SM [17]. The minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) [18,19] postulates the existence of two Higgs doublets, resulting in five physical states: two CP-even, one CP-odd, and two charged Higgs bosons. This version of SUSY has been extensively tested using data collected by the ATLAS and CMS experiments at the CERN LHC. However, nonminimal SUSY extensions have received far less attention. One example is the next-to-MSSM (NMSSM), which extends the MSSM by an additional singlet superfield, interacting only with itself and the two Higgs doublets [18,[20][21][22][23][24][25][26]. This scenario has all the desirable features of SUSY, including a solution of the hierarchy problem and gauge coupling unification. In the NMSSM, the Higgs mixing parameter \u00b5 is naturally generated at the electroweak scale through the vacuum expectation value of the singlet field, thereby solving the so-called \u00b5 problem of the MSSM [27].",

These models provide possible signatures that cannot be realized in the MSSM given recent experimental constraints [37]. For example, the decays H(125) \u2192 h 1 h 1 and H(125) \u2192 a 1 a 1 are allowed when kinematically possible. These decay signatures have been investigated in phenomenological studies considering a variety of production modes at the LHC [38][39][40][41][42][43][44][45]. The analysis presented in this paper is motivated by the NMSSM scenarios that predict a very light h 1 or a 1 state with mass in the range 2m \u03c4 < m h 1 (m a 1 ) < 2m b , where m \u03c4 is the mass of the \u03c4 lepton and m b is the mass of the b quark. Such a light state is potentially accessible in final states with four \u03c4 leptons, where H(125) \u2192 h 1 h 1 (a 1 a 1 ) \u2192 4\u03c4 [46,47]. In these scenarios the decay H(125) \u2192 a 2 a 2 is not kinematically allowed.",

The analyses carried out by the OPAL and ALEPH Collaborations at LEP [48,49] searched for the decay of the CPeven Higgs boson into a pair of light CP-odd Higgs bosons, exploiting the Higgs-strahlung process, where the CP-even state is produced in association with a Z boson. These searches found no evidence for a signal, and limits were placed on the signal production cross section times branching fraction. However, searches at LEP did not probe masses of the CP-even state above 114 GeV. A similar study has been performed by the D0 Collaboration at the Tevatron [50], searching for inclusive production of the CP-even Higgs boson in pp collisions followed by its decay into a pair of light CP-odd Higgs bosons. No signal was detected and upper limits were set on the signal production cross section times branching fraction in the mass ranges 3.6 < m a 1 < 19 GeV and 89 < m H < 200 GeV.

These calorimeters cover |\u03b7| < 3.0. A quartz fiber Cherenkov forward hadron detector extends the calorimetric coverage to |\u03b7| < 5.0. Muons are measured in the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 2.4, with detection planes made using three technologies: drift tubes, cathode strip chambers, and resistive-plate chambers.

The H(125) boson p T spectrum from pythia is reweighted to the spectrum obtained from a next-to-leading-order computation with a next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy using the HqT 2.0 program [55,56], which performs the resummation of the large logarithmic contributions appearing at transverse momenta much smaller than the mass of the Higgs boson. For optimisation studies, diboson and quantum chromodynamics (QCD) multijet backgrounds are simulated by pythia. Inclusive Z, W, and tt production are modelled with MadGraph 5.1 [57]. The MadGraph generator is interfaced with pythia for parton showering and fragmentation. The pythia parameters that steer the simulation of hadronisation and the underlying event are set to the most recent pythia Z2* tune.

The invariant mass of each selected muon and the nearby track is reconstructed. The two-dimensional distribution of the invariant mass of each selected muon and the nearby track is used to discriminate between the signal and the QCD multijet background; the signal is extracted by means of a fit to this two-dimensional distribution. The binning of the two-dimensional (m 1 , m 2 ) distributions is illustrated in figure 2. For masses below 3 GeV, bins of 1 GeV width are used for both m 1 and m 2 . For masses in the range 3 < m 1 (m 2 ) < 10 GeV, a single bin is used. This choice avoids poorly populated bins in the two-dimensional (m 1 , m 2 ) distributions in the background control regions used to construct and validate the QCD multijet background model (section 6). For each selected event, the (m 1 , m 2 ) histogram is filled once if the pair of quantities (m 1 , m 2 ) occurs in one of the diagonal bins and twice, once with values (m 1 , m 2 ) and a second time with the swapped values (m 2 , m 1 ), for off-diagonal bins. This procedure insures the symmetry of the twodimensional (m 1 , m 2 ) distribution. To avoid double counting of events, the off-diagonal bins (i, j) with i > j are excluded from the procedure of the signal extraction (the hatched bins in figure 2). Thus, the number of independent bins is reduced from 4 \u00d7 4 = 16 to 4 \u00d7 (4 + 1)/2 = 10.",

The simulation shows that more than 99% of events selected in this control region, hereafter referred to as N 23 , are QCD multijet events. The modelling of the f 1D (m) pdf is based on the assumption that the kinematic distributions for the first muon-track system are not affected by the isolation requirement imposed on the second, and therefore the f 1D (m) pdf of the isolated muon-track system is the same in the signal region and the region N 23 .",

            "text": "A direct test of this assumption, given the limited size of the simulated sample of QCD multijet events, is not conclusive, and a test is therefore performed with an additional control sample. Events are selected in this control sample if one of the muons has at least one track passing the one-prong \u03c4 decay candidate criteria within a \u2206R cone of radius 0.5 around the muon direction, with any number of additional tracks within the same \u2206R cone. As more than one of these tracks can pass the selection criteria for a one-prong \u03c4 decay candidate, we investigate two scenarios. In one scenario, the lowest p T (\"softest\") track passing the one-prong \u03c4 decay candidate criteria is used to calculate the muon-track invariant mass, while in the other scenario the highest p T (\"hardest\") track passing the one-prong \u03c4 decay candidate criteria is used. If only one \u03c4 track is found around the first muon, the track is regarded as both \"hardest\" and \"softest\". For the second muon, two isolation requirements are considered: when the muon is accompanied by only one track passing the one-prong \u03c4 decay candidate criteria (N trk,2 = 1) as in the signal region, or when it is accompanied by two or three tracks (N trk,2 = 2, 3) with p T > 1 GeV and impact parameters smaller than 1 cm relative to the PV as in the region N 23 . The shapes of invariant mass distributions of the first muon and the softest or hardest accompanying track are then compared for the two different isolation requirements on the second muon, N trk,2 = 1 and N trk,2 = 2, 3. The test is performed both on data and on the simulated sample of QCD multijet events. The results of this study are illustrated in figure 3. In all considered cases, the shape of the invariant mass distribution is compatible within statistical uncertainties between the two cases, N trk,2 = 1 and N trk,2 = 2, 3. This observation validates the assumption that the f 1D (m) pdf can be determined in the control region N 23 .    In order to determine the correlation coefficients C(i, j) we define an additional control region A enriched in QCD multijet events. This control region consists of events that contain two same-sign muons passing the identification and kinematic selection criteria -  outlined in section 4. Each muon is required to have two or three nearby tracks within a \u2206R cone of radius 0.5 around the muon direction. One and only one of these tracks must satisfy the criteria imposed on one-prong \u03c4 lepton decay candidates with p T > 2.5 GeV. The additional tracks must have transverse momentum in the range 1 < p T < 2.5 GeV. A total of 9127 data events are selected in this control region. The MC simulation predicts that the QCD multijet background dominates in region A, comprising more than 99% of all selected events. The simulation study also shows that the overall background-to-signal ratio is enhanced compared to the signal region by a factor of 15 to 20, depending on the mass hypothesis m \u03c6 1 . Despite the large increase in the overall background-to-signal ratio, potential signal contamination in individual bins of the mass distributions can be nonnegligible. Bin-by-bin signal contamination in region A is discussed in section 7. For each event in control region A, the pair (m 1 ,m 2 ) of muon-track invariant masses is calculated. This pair is used to build the symmetrized normalized two-dimensional distribution f 2D (i, j) defined in figure 2. Then C(i, j) is obtained according to eq. (6.2) as",

These tests are performed in a control region B, where each muon is required to have at least one track passing the one-prong \u03c4 decay candidate selection criteria, i.e. with p T > 2.5 GeV and impact parameters smaller than 200 \u00b5m and 400 \u00b5m in the transverse plane and along beam axis, respectively. Along with this requirement each muon is allowed to have one or more tracks within a \u2206R cone of radius 0.5 around the muon direction, with p T > 1 GeV and impact parameters smaller than 1 cm. Control region B is characterized by a significantly larger yield of QCD multijet events compared to the signal region and control region A, thus making it possible to perform reliable MC consistency tests and assess the uncertainties in C(i, j). Two scenarios are investigated: 1) muons are paired with the softest one-prong \u03c4 decay candidate and 2) muons are paired with the hardest one-prong \u03c4 decay candidate. If only one oneprong \u03c4 decay candidate is found around a muon, it is regarded as both \"softest\" and \"hardest\". In both scenarios the correlation coefficients computed using the reconstructed four-momenta of muons and tracks are found to be compatible with those computed using generator-level four-momenta, within statistical uncertainties. Furthermore, the correlation coefficients computed with the inclusive QCD multijet sample are found to be compatible with those computed in the exclusive MC sample including only the gg(qq) \u2192 bb production mechanisms. This observation validates the use of the generator-level information and the exclusive bb MC sample to compare C(i, j) between the signal region and control region A. This comparison is presented in figure 6. The uncertainties in C(i, j) represent a quadratic sum of the systematic and MC statistical uncertainties. The systematic uncertainties are derived from the control region B. They take into account 1) any differences in C(i, j) calculated using the inclusive QCD multijet sample compared with the exclusive bb sample and 2) any differences in C(i, j) calculated using full detector simulation and event reconstruction compared with the study using generator-level quantities. Within their uncertainties the correlation coefficients C(i, j) in the signal region and in region A are compatible. We therefore use C(i, j) derived from data in region A to predict the QCD multijet background shape in the signal region according to eq. (6.2).",

For the values of the H(125) boson production cross sections predicted in the SM, the expected contribution from the qqH and VH processes to the final selected sample is estimated to be less than 4% of total signal yield for all tested m \u03c6 1 hypotheses. The shapes of the two-dimensional (m 1 , m 2 ) distributions are found to be nearly indistinguishable among the three considered production modes, making it difficult to extract individual contributions from these processes in a model independent way. In the following these contributions are neglected, resulting in more conservative upper limits on (\u03c3B) sig . Subtraction of the qqH and VH contributions assuming the SM cross sections for the H(125) production mechanisms would decrease the upper limits on (\u03c3B) sig by less than 4% for all tested values of m \u03c6 1 .",

Table 3 presents the number of observed data events, the predicted background yields obtained from a fit under the background-only hypothesis, and the expected signal yields obtained from simulation, for each unique bin in the two-dimensional (m 1 , m 2 ) distribution. The data are well described by the background-only model. The signal cross section times branching fraction is constrained by performing a fit under the signal+background hypothesis, where both the background and signal normalisations are allowed to vary freely in the fit. A representative example of the fit under the signal+background hypothesis at m \u03c6 1 = 8 GeV is presented in figure 7 (right). No significant deviations from the background expectation are observed in data. Only a small excess is found for 6 \u2264 m \u03c6 1 \u2264 8 GeV, with a local significance ranging between 1.2\u03c3 (m \u03c6 1 = 8 GeV) and 1.4\u03c3 (m \u03c6 1 = 6 GeV). Results of the analysis are used to set upper limits on (\u03c3B) sig at 95% CL. The modified frequentist CL s criterion [70,71], implemented in the RooStats package [72], is used for the calculation of the exclusion limits. Figure 8 shows the observed upper limit on (\u03c3B) sig at 95% CL, together with the expected limit obtained under the background-only hypothesis, for m \u03c6 1 in the range from 4 to 8 GeV.
