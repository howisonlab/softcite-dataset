            "text": "We report a measurement of muon annual modulation in a 12-l liquid scintillation detector with a live-time of more than 4 years at the Soudan Underground Laboratory. Muon minimum ionization in the detector is identified by its observed pulse shape and large energy deposition. The measured muon rate in the detector is 28.69 \u00b1 2.09 muons per day with a modulation amplitude of (2.64 \u00b1 0.07)% and a phase at Jul 22 \u00b1 36.2 days. This annual modulation is correlated with the variation of the effective atmospheric temperature in the stratosphere. The correlation coefficient, \u03b1 T , is determined to be 0.898 \u00b1 0.025. This can be interpreted as a measurement of the atmospheric charged kaon to pion (K /\u03c0 ) ratio of 0.094 +0.044   \u22120.061 for E p > 7 TeV, consistent with the measurement from the MINOS far detector. To further constrain the value of K /\u03c0 ratio, a Geant4 simulation of the primary cosmic-ray protons with energy up to 100 TeV is implemented to study the correlation of K /\u03c0 ratio and the muon annual modulation for muon energy greater than 0.5 TeV. We find out that a charged K /\u03c0 ratio of 0.1598, greater than the upper bound (0.138) from this work at the production point 30 km above the Earth surface in the stratosphere cannot induce muon annual modulation at the depth of Soudan.",

            "text": "Energetic muons produced by the decay processes of pions and kaons in the stratosphere can reach deep underground. Numerous underground detectors discovered the annual modulation of muon rates [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13]. This annual modulation is believed to be correlated with a slow temperature variation over seasons in the stratosphere where those muons are produced. Therefore, the muon flux underground has a dependency on the effective temperature of the stratoa e-mail: Dongming. Mei@usd.edu sphere. An increase in the effective temperature in the stratosphere results in a lower density profile, which decreases the probability of pions and kaons interacting with the atmospheric particles. Consequently, more pions and kaons undergo decays, which increases the numbers of muons observed in a detector deep underground. Such a correlation factor, named \u03b1 T , between the measured muon flux modulation underground and the effective temperature variation in the stratosphere was studied by several experiments such as AMANDA [7], Borexino [8], MACRO [6] and MINOS [11]. Since kaons and pions in the primary hadronic interactions of cosmic rays in the stratosphere contribute differently to \u03b1 T due to the different masses and lifetimes, it was suggested that measuring the correlation factor, \u03b1 T , between the annual modulation observed in an underground detector and the temperature variation in the stratosphere can provide the information on the atmospheric charged kaon/pion (K /\u03c0 ) ratio [14]. This is particularly interesting for an underground site where the observed muons from primary cosmic rays can have energies greater than 7 TeV, since the Large Hadron Collider [15] only provides a collision energy of \u223c 7 TeV. Therefore, the phenomenon of the correlation between the muon annual modulation in an underground detector and the temperature variation in the stratosphere deserves more experimental and theoretical investigations to understand the expected local behavior of the atmospheric temperature effect and the difference in the muon flux over a long period of time. Such a strong correlation over a long period of time indicates a stable atmospheric charged K /\u03c0 ratio, which could shed light on the energies of the primary cosmic rays, and opens a new window for high energy cosmic ray astronomy.",

The energy response to the entire energy range is accumulated and shown in Fig. 1. To maintain a stable energy scale over the entire experimental period, the peak position of the muon minimum ionization is closely monitored. Energies are re-calibrated on weekly basis according to the variation of the peak position from the muon minimum ionization along with time. The pedestal value is also monitored and used in the correction of the pulse shapes when calculating energies. The \u03b3 rays from radioactive decays ( 40 K, 232 Th and 238 U) and (\u03b1, \u03b3 ) reactions induced by radon decays are also recorded and analyzed [18]. The energies of \u03b3 rays are significantly below 20 MeV.

The phase t 0 is the time when the signal reaches its maximum. The top plot in Fig. 2   Fig. 2 is the muon variation curve. Data points with energy greater than the muon minimum ionization peak are collected to avoid the gamma ray contamination and any potential energy shift. With the fixed period of 365.1 days, the fitted result gives the variation amplitude of (2.64 \u00b1 0.07)% with the phase at Jul 22 \u00b1 36.2 days. The correlation of the percentage variation in the observed muon rate \u0394I \u03bc / < I \u03bc > correlates with the change in effective temperature \u0394T e f f / < T e f f > is shown in Fig. 3. The fitting result determines the value of \u03b1 T = 0.898 \u00b1 0.025. The error is dominated by the statistical uncertainty, since the systematical uncertainty is negligible. This is because the systematical uncertainty was carefully avoided using weekly calibration and the muon events were selected with energy greater than 20 MeV, which largely excludes gamma-ray (E \u03b3 < 20 MeV) contamination. In addition, the event rate from the muon-induced neutrons is much smaller than the muon event rate detected in the detector.",

In the summer time, the temperature in the stratosphere increases. As a result, the air density decreases. Therefore, more mesons undergo decay processes to produce more energetic muons, which can be observed in a detector underground. In contrast to the summer, the temperature in the stratosphere decreases in the winter time, which increases the air density. Thus, more mesons can interact with air particles to produce muons with lower energies, which have less chance to reach a detector deep underground. This phenomenon is observed as the muon rate annual modulation in a detector underground. Since kaons (K + and K \u2212 have a shorter half-life (12.4 ns) than pions (26 ns for \u03c0 + and \u03c0 \u2212 ) [22], it is expected that this phenomenon is mainly due to the change of the fraction of pions that undergo decays with respect to the interactions with air particles [14] in the stratosphere. Accordingly, the correlation between the observed muon rate annual modulation and the variation of temperature in the stratosphere is sensitive to the K /\u03c0 ratio in the production place. As a result, measuring this correlation provides an indirect way to measure the K /\u03c0 ratio induced by very high energy cosmic rays in the stratosphere. The atmospheric K /\u03c0 ratio was first measured using the MINOS-FD data in 2009 [11]. The measured \u03b1 T , 0.873 \u00b1 0.009(stat) \u00b1 0.010(syst) was used to determine the K /\u03c0 ratio together with the theoretical prediction with large errors up to 40% [23]. The determined atmospheric K /\u03c0 ratio is 0.12 +0.07 \u22120.05 . Utilizing a well-understood 12-l liquid scintillation detector, we have determined \u03b1 T = 0.898\u00b10.025, which corresponds to a K /\u03c0 ratio of 0.094 +0.044 \u22120.061 . To further con-",

Since this K /\u03c0 ratio given by the Geant4 simulation is greater than the upper bound of 0.138 determined by this work. This simulation sheds light on the constrain of the charged K /\u03c0 ratio, which is in favor of the measured value 0.0924 +0.044 \u22120.061 . This lower K /\u03c0 ratio is \u00b1 K \u00b1 \u03c0 Fig. 8 The average energy conversion of parent \u03c0 \u00b1, k\u00b1 versus secondary muons Fig. 9 The expected muon rate annual modulation for muon energy greater than 0.5 TeV. The modulation amplitude is only 0.42%, which is much less than the experimental measurement of 2.64% also consistent with the hypothesis of the muon rate annual modulation is mainly due to the change of the fraction of pions that undergo decays with respect to the interactions with air particles [14] in the stratosphere. A higher K /\u03c0 ratio would reduce the muon rate annual modulation because kaons are not as sensitive as pions to the temperature variation in the stratosphere due to a relatively short half-life. This has been demonstrated by the simulated results in Figs. 9 and 10 where the large scatter of points represents the muons from kaon decays, which are less sensitive to the temperature variation when comparing with pions. Note that the Soudan Underground Laboratory has a flat surface. We used the flat Earth surface approximation to simulation muons traversing The upper bound from a theoretical prediction [14] The central value from a theoretical prediction [14] The lower bound from a theoretical prediction [14] This work",

Data analysis gives a muon flux I \u03bc = (1.65 \u00b1 0.12) \u00d7 10 \u22127 cm \u22122 s \u22121 . Seasonal modulation of muon rates are observed with the percentage amplitude of 2.64% and the phase to be Jul 22\u00b136.2 days. The correlation between atmospheric temperature variations and the changes in the muon rates observed in our detector has been investigated. The temperature coefficient of \u03b1 T = 0.898 \u00b1 0.025 is found for the under-ground depth where our detector is located. This result is in a good agreement with the measurement made by the MINOS-FD (0.873 \u00b1 0.009(stat.) \u00b1 0.010(syst.)). The value of \u03b1 T , 0.898\u00b10.025, implies that the atmospheric K /\u03c0 ratio is 0.094 +0.044 \u22120.061 in the stratosphere determined by this work. Utilizing the Geant4 simulation, we find out a charged K /\u03c0 ratio of 0.1598, greater than 0.138 the upper bound of this work, cannot contribute to the observed the muon annual modulation in our detector at the Soudan Underground Laboratory. If one combines this work with the measurement of MINOS (0.12 +0.07 \u22120.05 ), the charged K /\u03c0 ratio is constrained to a range between 0.07 and 0.0138, as shwon in Fig. 11 determined by the observed muon annual modulation at the depth of Soudan.",
