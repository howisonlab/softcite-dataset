The data were obtained by the COMPASS experiment at CERN using a 160 GeV/c polarised muon beam scattering off a polarised 6 LiD target. The gluon polarisation is evaluated by a Neural Network approach for three intervals of the gluon momentum fraction x g covering the range 0.04 < x g < 0.27 . The values obtained at leading order in QCD do not show any significant dependence on x g . Their average is \u2206g/g = 0.125 \u00b1 0.060 (stat.) \u00b1 0.063 (syst.) at x g = 0.09 and a scale of \u00b5 2 = 3 (GeV/c) 2 .",

            "text": "The spin structure of the nucleon has been studied in polarised Deep Inelastic lepton-nucleon Scattering (DIS) for many years. The experimental observation by EMC [1] that only a small fraction of the nucleon spin is carried by quark spins has strongly influenced more recent developments of spin physics. Several experiments were performed to confirm this result [2][3][4][5][6][7][8]. More measurements are in progress and/or in the data analysis phase: HERMES at DESY, STAR and PHENIX at RHIC, a number of experiments at JLAB, and COMPASS at CERN. Several theoretical ideas were proposed [9] to explain this observation. In order to investigate the origin of the nucleon spin, it is essential to determine the spin fraction carried by gluons. Information about this quantity can be obtained indirectly from scaling violations in the structure function g 1 (see Refs. [8,10,11] and references therein) or from a direct measurement of the gluon polarisation (see Refs. [12][13][14][15][16][17][18]).",

For this process the contribution from the leading order diagram is small because, in the COMPASS kinematic domain, the charm quark content in the nucleon is negligible. Due to the large mass of the charm quark, the contribution from fragmentation processes is also small. However, for the same reason, charm pair production in PGF is suppressed, so that the statistical precision on the gluon polarisation obtained in this way is limited. A way to overcome this limitation is to tag the PGF process leading to light quark pair production by detecting final state hadrons with large transverse momentum, p T , with respect to the virtual photon direction.",

A different situation occurs for QCDC and PGF processes, in which hadrons mainly acquire transverse momentum from the partons produced in the hard process. For this reason the requirement of observing two hadrons with large transverse momentum enhances the contribution of the PGF process in the selected sample [20]. We present hereafter an analysis using this approach for the enhancement of PGF events in light quark production [21,22]. 3 DETERMINATION OF \u2206G/G FROM MEASURED ASYMMETRIES",

Events with y < 0.1 and with y > 0.9 are rejected because the former are more sensitive to experimental biases, while the latter are strongly affected by radiative effects. The above requirements define the inclusive sample. At least two additional charged hadrons associated with the vertex are required for the high-p T sample. In the analysis the two hadrons with the highest p T are selected and the following requirements are applied: p T 1 > 0.7 GeV/c for the leading hadron, p T 2 > 0.4 GeV/c for the sub-leading hadron, x F > 0 for the Feynman variables of both hadrons and z 1 + z 2 < 0.95, where z 1,2 is the ratio of the hadron energy to the virtual photon energy.

The labels LP, QCDC and PGF refer to the processes presented in Fig. 1. The depolarisation factor D is the fraction of the muon beam polarisation transferred to the virtual photon and depends mainly on y. The variables x B j , x g and x C are the quark momentum fraction, the gluon momentum fraction in the PGF process and the quark momentum fraction in the QCDC process, respectively. Equation (1) is valid at LO in QCD assuming spin independent fragmentation. A possible spin dependence of fragmentation discussed in Ref. [25] can be neglected in the COMPASS kinematic region.",

(1) is possible only when the contributions from background processes (LP, QCDC) can be computed and subtracted. In this analysis, the fractions R i and the analysing powers a i LL are extracted from Monte Carlo (MC). Therefore, the analysis requires a precise MC description of the data, so that R i and a i LL can be calculated reliably. The asymmetry A LO 1 can be evaluated from the spin-dependent and spin-averaged PDFs extracted from global fits or by using directly the measured inclusive lepton-nucleon asymmetry A incl LL . In the present analysis we use the second option, which is less dependent on QCD analyses and related assumptions. As there are two unknowns in Eq.

In previous analyses of high-p T events [13,17] only mean values of R i and a i LL /D for the three processes were used and the contribution of the leading process was suppressed by requiring the presence of two hadrons with high transverse momenta. Unfortunately, these requirements lead to a severe loss of statistics. In the present analysis, a Bayesian driven Neural Network (NN) approach for the extraction of \u2206g/g is used. It allows the use of loose p T cuts by dealing simultaneously with the three processes. The NN, trained on a MC sample, assigns to each event a probability to originate from one of these processes, which is then included in the weight w. Events more likely originating from processes other than PGF are kept with a small weight. For a given event, different NNs provide not only the probabilities to originate from a particular process but also the corresponding analysing powers and the momentum fractions x C and x g . This approach makes optimal use of the data and avoids biases which may arise from correlations between analysing power and kinematic quantities used to evaluate the asymmetries. The statistical uncertainty of \u2206g/g is reduced by a factor of three comparing with the method used in [13].",

The impact of this discordance will be taken into account in the evaluation of systematic uncertainties. In order to further improve the agreement with data for the hadron variables, some parameters describing the fragmentation process in LEPTO were tuned (high-p T tuning in Table 1). They correspond to the width of the gaussian p T distribution (PARJ 21), the shape of the non-gaussian tail (PARJ 23, PARJ 24) and the symmetric Lund fragmentation function (PARJ 41, PARJ 42).

Figure 3 displays the corresponding comparison for the hadron variables (total and transverse momenta p 1 , p T 1 of the leading and the sub-leading hadron p 2 , p T 2 and the hadron multiplicity.

In addition to what was already discussed, it is worth mentioning that for 'PS on' and 'PS off' different so-called cut- off schemes were used to prevent divergences in the cross-section calculations in LEPTO (see Ref. [28]). These schemes and their parameters are quite important since their choice does not affect the data-to-MC comparison but changes the fraction of, e.g. PGF events. So, while keeping the default cut-off parameters proposed by the authors of Ref. [28], we tested various cut-off schemes.

The material in u and d cells is polarised in opposite directions. Spin orientations are reversed three times per day in 2002-2004 and once per day in 2006 by rotation of the target magnetic 4 MONTE CARLO OPTIMISATION AND NEURAL NETWORK TRAINING field by 180 \u2022 . Data from before (u, d) and after such a rotation (u \u2032 , d \u2032 ) are combined in a so-called spin configuration, where nucleon spins in u and d \u2032 (d and u \u2032 ) have the same orientation.",
