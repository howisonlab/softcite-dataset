            "text": "Direct photons and dileptons are clean probes to study the fundamental properties of a hot and dense medium created in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Due to minimal interactions with the strongly interacting medium, they can bring the information of the whole time evolution and dynamics of the medium. The PHENIX direct-photon measurements in Au+Au, d+Au and p + p collisions at \u221a s NN = 200 GeV showed that for p T < 4 GeV/c an enhanced yield above the number of binary collision (N coll ) scaled p + p production is observed in Au+Au while there is no similar enhancement in d+Au collisions. In the high p T range, the invariant yield in Au+Au collisions is consistent with N coll scaled p + p production and the NLO pQCD predictions [1,2]. The results from ALICE in Pb+Pb and p + p collisions at \u221a s NN = 2.76 TeV showed an excess in Pb+Pb over the scaled p + p for p T < 4 GeV/c [3] while the yield measured by CMS collaboration in Pb+Pb collisions follows the scaled p + p results and NLO pQCD predictions in the photon transverse energy (E T ) range 20-80 GeV [4]. These measurements indicate that in the low p T range, there are contributions from other sources rather than initial hard parton scattering. The study on direct photons opens two kinematic windows. One is the low p T range for the in-medium effect study. The other one is the high p T range for the hard process research. With the comparison to model prediction, some key parameters of the QGP matter such as initial temperature can be obtained [5]. There are two methods for direct photon measurement. One is the real photon method in which one measures all inclusive photons and then subtracts the hadron decayed photons from them. The other one is the virtual photon method in which one measures the virtual photon by their associate dielectron pairs and then deduces the direct photon from the relationship between virtual photon and direct photon. The latter is used in this article. The dielectron measurement in Au+Au collisions at 200 GeV at STAR from year 2010 data has been published recently [6]. The preliminary results on dielectron production in p + p collisions at 200 GeV from year 2012 can be found in [7]. In this article, we focus on the measurement of direct photon in Au+Au collisions at 200 GeV.",

There are 258 million and 488 million minimum bias (0-80%) events from Run10 and Run11, respectively, passing bad run rejections and vertex selections. The main subsystems used for electron identification are the Time Projection Chamber (TPC) [8] and the Time-of-Flight detector (TOF) [9] for the minimum-bias events. With the requirements on the particle energy loss (dE/dx) measured by TPC close to electron expected dE/dx and time-of-flight measured by TOF close to the speed of light, electron samples can be selected with high purity. The electron purity is about 95% in Au+Au minimum bias collisions. The dielectron invariant mass spectra are obtained separately with Run10 and Run11 datasets. The final results are then combined point-to-point according to their relative statistical uncertainties. To improve the statistics at high p T , we use the Barrel Electro-Magnetic Calorimeter (BEMC) [10] triggered events taken in Run11. The 39 million BEMC triggered events used in this analysis are equivalent to 5389 million minimum bias triggered events. The BEMC trigger significantly enhances the capability of STAR for high p T dielectron measurement. For BEMC triggered electrons, additional requirements on the ratio of momentum measured by the TPC to the energy deposited in the BEMC are utilized. The electron purity can reach about 80% for BEMC triggered electron sample. The dielectron invariant mass spectrum in this paper are within STAR acceptance (p e T > 0.2 GeV/c, |\u03b7 e | < 1, |y ee | < 1) and corrected for efficiency, in which p e T is the electron p T , \u03b7 e is the electron pseudo-rapidity, and y ee is the rapidity of electron-positron pairs. The dielectron invariant mass spectra in different p T ranges are shown in Fig. 1. The results for p T < 5 GeV/c are the combined results from Run10 and Run11 minimum bias data. The results for p T > 5 GeV/c are from the BEMC triggered data. More dielectron analysis details and results can be found in [6,11].",

The d\u03c3 NLO \u03b3 (p T ) is the p T -differential invariant cross section of direct photon obtained from [16]. The N inclusive \u03b3 (p T ) is the STAR measurement which is in form of F/( 2\u03b1 3\u03c0 )/(2\u03c0p T d p T dy), in which F is the normalization factor of f dir . The data show consistency with NLO pQCD calculation within uncertainties at p T > 4 GeV/c. A clear enhancement in data compared to the calculation for 1 < p T < 4 GeV/c is observed. Figure 3 shows the invariant yield of the direct photons in Au+Au collisions at 200 GeV. In the left panel, the open circles are the direct photon invariant yields measured from STAR 200 GeV 0-80% Au+Au collisions. The uncertainty is dominated by systematic uncertainty in the cocktail. The large systematic uncertainties in 1-2 GeV/c are due to the lack of \u03b7 measurement in the corresponding p T range. The \u03b7 dN/dy and p T input for cocktail simulation in this range are based on the extrapolation of the TBW model [17], while at p T > 2 GeV/c, it is constrained by the measurements. The triangles are the invariant cross sections in p + p collisions at 200 GeV measured by PHENIX collaboration. They are parameterized by a power-law function, as shown in dotted line. The parameterized distribution is then scaled by the nuclear overlapping factor T AA = N bin /42mb = 6.95mb \u22121 as shown in dashed line, and compared to the Au+Au results. For 1 < p T < 4 GeV/c, the Au+Au results are clearly higher than the T AA scaled p + p results, while at high p T the Au+Au yield is consistent with the scaled p + p expectation. The right panel shows a comparison between STAR Au+Au data and model calculations done by Ralf Rapp et al. [5,18]. The curves \"QGP\" stands for the contribution from QGP thermal radiation.

The direct photon measurement based on virtual photon method is firstly extended to high p T of 10 GeV/c. In the low p T range 1-4 GeV/c, the production of direct photon can access the thermal radiation from QGP and hadron gas. The direct photon invariant yield in this range shows a clear excess in Au+Au over the number of binary collision scaled p + p results. In the p T range above 4 GeV/c, there is no clear enhancement observed. A model prediction which includes the contributions from thermal radiation and initial hard process is consistent with our direct photon yield within uncertainties.",
