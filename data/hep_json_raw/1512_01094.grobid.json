            "text": "The identification of jets containing b hadrons is an important tool used in a spectrum of measurements comprising the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) physics programme. In precision measurements in the top quark sector as well as in the search for the Higgs boson and new phenomena, the suppression of background processes that contain predominantly light-flavour jets using b-tagging is of great use. It may also become critical to achieve an understanding of the flavour structure of any new physics (e.g. supersymmetry) revealed at the LHC. Several algorithms to identify jets containing b hadrons have been developed, exploiting the long lifetime, high mass and decay multiplicity of b hadrons and the hard b-quark fragmentation function. They range from an algorithm that uses the signed significance of the decay length with respect to the proton-proton collision location, in the following referred to as the primary vertex, of an inclusively reconstructed secondary vertex to more refined algorithms using both secondary vertex properties and the significance of the transverse and longitudinal impact parameters of the charged particle tracks. The most discriminating observables resulting from these algorithms are combined in artificial neural networks. An independent b-tagging algorithm based on reconstructed muons inside jets, exploiting the relatively large fraction of b-hadron decays with muons in the final state, about 20%, and the b-tagging algorithm used for the online trigger selection have also been developed.",

            "text": "To use b-tagging in physics analyses, the efficiency b with which a jet containing a b hadron is tagged by a b-tagging algorithm needs to be measured. Other necessary pieces of information are the probability of mistakenly tagging a jet containing a c hadron (but not a b hadron) or a light-flavour parton (u-, d-, s-quark or gluon g) jet as a b jet. In the following, these are referred to as the c-jet tagging efficiency and mistag rate, respectively. Several methods have been developed to measure the b-jet tagging efficiency, the c-jet tagging efficiency and the mistag rate in data. The b-jet tagging efficiency has been measured in an inclusive sample of jets with muons inside and in samples of tt events with one or two leptons in the final state. The c-jet tagging efficiency has been measured in an inclusive sample of jets associated -1 -to D + mesons as well as in a sample of W + c events. The mistag rate has been measured in an inclusive jet sample. The calibration results are presented as data-to-simulation scale factors, derived from the ratio of the efficiency or mistag rate measured in data to that obtained in simulated events. Where more than one calibration method exists the results from the various analyses have been combined taking into account the statistical and systematic correlation.",

            "text": "This paper is intended to provide a complete description of almost all the b-tagging developments in ATLAS during Run 1 of the LHC in the years 2010 -2012. The results are illustrated with data taken in the year 2011 at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV. As these developments extended over a period of years, there is some variation between the simulated samples and systematic uncertainties used for the data efficiency measurements depending on the chronology. Also, several of the methods developed to measure the tagging efficiency of b jets on the small samples available at the start of Run 1 have meanwhile been abandoned in favour of more precise calibration methods developed later; this is reflected in the choice of results used in the combination of b-jet efficiency measurements made to achieve the ultimate precision. In those methods used previously, quoted values and uncertainties for parameters entering the analysis do reflect the best knowledge at the time. They have not been updated since to benefit from the improved present knowledge on some of the analysis ingredients. Section 2 starts with a discussion of the data and simulated samples used throughout this paper, along with a description of the corrections applied to the simulated samples to reproduce the experimental conditions present in the data. The various b-tagging algorithms are described in sections 3, 4, and 5. Section 6 discusses the effects of pile-up, while section 7 provides a comparison between data and simulated samples of distributions of selected quantities important for b-tagging. Calibrations of the b-jet tagging efficiency and their combination are discussed in sections 8, 9, 10, and 11. Calibrations of the c-jet tagging efficiency are covered in sections 12 and 13, while the mistag rate calibration is discussed in sections 14 and 15.",

The trigger selections used in the different studies are described in the corresponding sections. The key objects for b-tagging are the calorimeter jets, the tracks reconstructed in the Inner Detector and the signal primary vertex of the hard-scattering collision of interest which is selected from the set of all reconstructed primary vertices. Each vertex is required to have two or more tracks. Tracks are reconstructed from clusters of signals in the silicon pixel and microstrip sensors, and drift circles in the straw tube tracker (collectively referred to as \"hits\" in the following). They are associated with the calorimeter jets based on their angular separation \u2206R(track, jet) \u2261 (\u2206\u03b7) 2 + (\u2206\u03c6) 2 . The association \u2206R cut varies as a function of the jet p T , resulting in a narrower cone for jets at high p T which are more collimated. At 20 GeV, it is 0.45 while for more energetic jets with a p T of 150 GeV the \u2206R cut is 0.26. Any given track is associated with at most one jet; if it satisfies the association criterion with respect to more than one jet, the jet with the smallest \u2206R is chosen. The track selection criteria depend on the b-tagging algorithm, and are detailed in section 3.",

The jet reconstruction is done at the electromagnetic scale and then a scale factor is applied in order to obtain the jet energy at the hadronic scale. In the studies based on jets with associated muons, the jet energy is further corrected for the energy of the muon and the average energy of the corresponding neutrino in simulated events, to arrive at the jet energy scale of an inclusive b-jet sample. The measurement of the jet energy and the specific cuts used to reject jets of bad quality are described in ref. [6]. The jets are generally required to have |\u03b7| < 2.5 and transverse momentum p T > 20 GeV. Furthermore, the jet vertex fraction (JVF) is computed as the summed transverse momentum of the tracks associated with a jet consistent with originating from the selected primary vertex (defined as having a longitudinal impact parameter with respect to it less than 1 mm) divided by the summed transverse momentum of all tracks associated with a jet, where only tracks with transverse impact -3 -parameters less than 1.5 mm are considered; it is required to be larger than 0.75. The selection of the primary vertex is described in section 3.1.

The number of reconstructed primary vertices is substantially larger than one in the presence of pile-up interactions: during the highest instantaneous luminosity of the 2011 data taking period, six primary vertex candidates were reconstructed on average. The adopted strategy is to choose the primary vertex candidate that maximises the sum of the associated tracks' p 2 T . The performance of this algorithm depends on the final state and on the pile-up conditions (as will be discussed further in section 6); simulation studies indicate that the probability to choose the correct primary vertex in tt events is higher than 98%, while in lower-multiplicity final states it can be considerably lower.",

Once associated with a jet, tracks are subject to specific requirements designed to select well-measured tracks and to reject so-called fake tracks (in which not all hits used for the track reconstruction originate from a single charged particle) and tracks from long-lived particles (K s , \u039b and other hyperon decays) or material interactions (photon conversions or hadronic interactions). The b-tagging baseline quality level requires at least seven precision hits (pixel or micro-strip hits) on the track, and at least two of these in the pixel detector, one of which must be in the innermost pixel layer. Only tracks with p T > 1 GeV are considered. The transverse and longitudinal impact parameters defined with respect to the primary vertex must fulfil |d 0 | < 1 mm and |z 0 | sin \u03b8 < 1.5 mm, where \u03b8 is the track polar angle (the factor sin \u03b8 serves to make the efficiency for tracks to pass these selection criteria less dependent on their polar angles). This selection is used by all the tagging algorithms relying on the impact parameters of tracks. The average number of b-tagging quality tracks associated to a jet with p T = 50 GeV (200 GeV) is 3.5 (7). In typical tt events, the average number of selected tracks per light-flavour (b quark) jet is 3.7 (5.5) and their average p T is 6.6 GeV (6.3 GeV), respectively. The SV and JetFitter algorithms use looser track selection criteria, in particular to maximise the efficiency to identify tracks originating from material interactions or -5 -decays of long-lived particles; these tracks are subsequently removed for b-tagging purposes. The main differences in the selection cuts for the SV algorithm are: p T > 400 MeV, |d 0 | < 3.5 mm (no cut on z 0 ). The corresponding cuts used by the JetFitter algorithm are: p T > 500 MeV, |d 0 | < 7 mm, |z 0 | sin \u03b8 < 10 mm.

A Kalman filter is used to find a common line in three dimensions JINST 11 P04008 on which the primary vertex and the bottom and charm vertices lie, as well as their positions on this line approximating the b-hadron flight path. With this approach, the band c-hadron vertices are not merged, even when only a single track is attached to each of them. In the JetFitter algorithm, the decay topology is described by the following discrete variables: the number of vertices with at least two tracks, the total number of tracks at these vertices, and the number of additional single track vertices on the b-hadron flight axis. The vertex information is condensed in the following observables, shown in figure 2: the vertex mass (the invariant mass of all charged particle tracks attached to the decay chain), the energy fraction (the energy of these charged particles divided by the sum of the energies of all charged particles associated to the jet), and the flight length significance L/\u03c3 L (the average displaced vertex decay length divided by its uncertainty; the individual reconstructed vertices contribute to the average decay length weighted by the inverse square of their decay length uncertainties). The six JetFitter variables defined above are used as input nodes in an artificial neural network. As the input variable distributions depend on the p T and |\u03b7| of the jets, these kinematic variables are included as two additional input nodes. To ensure that the jet p T and |\u03b7| spectra of the b, c and light-flavour jets in the training sample are not used by the neural network to separate the different jet flavours, a two-dimensional reweighting yielding flat kinematic distributions for all three jet flavours is performed prior to the neural network training. A coarse two-dimensional binning with seven bins in p T and three bins in |\u03b7| is used for the reweighting.

The network topology includes two hidden layers, with 12 and 7 nodes, respectively.

            "text": "The distributions of the correlations between the three input weights are also shown in figure 4, for b jets, c jets and light-flavour jets. These distributions illustrate the potential gain in combining the three weights: it can be seen that the IP3D weight has only limited correlations with the secondary vertex-based weights, while naturally SV1 and IP3D+JetFitter weights are more correlated but the correlation is different in the b-jet, c-jet and light-flavour-jet samples. The MV1 neural network is a perceptron with two hidden layers consisting of three and two nodes, respectively, and an output layer with a single node which holds the final discriminant variable. The implementation used is the MLP code from the TMVA package [20]. The training relies on a back-propagation algorithm and is based on two simulated samples of b jets (signal hypothesis) and light-flavour jets (background hypothesis). Most of the jets are obtained from simulated tt events and their average transverse momentum is around 60 GeV. To provide jets with higher p T for the training, simulated dijet events with jets in the 200 GeV < p T < 500 GeV range are also included. As in the case of the JetFitter neural network, since the tagging performance depends strongly on the p T and, to a lesser extent, on the \u03b7 of the jet, biases may arise from the different kinematic spectra of the two training samples (of light-flavour and b jets). To reduce this effect, weighted training events are used. Each jet is assigned to a category defined by a coarse two-dimensional grid in (p T , \u03b7) with four bins in \u03b7 and ten bins in p T . Jets in the same category are given the same weight, defined according to the overall fraction of all jets in this category, and the jet category is fed to the network as an additional input variable. The MV1 output weight distribution is shown in figure 5 for b, c, and light-flavour jets in simulated tt events. The spike around 0.15 corresponds mostly to jets for which no secondary vertex could be found.",

Since JetFitter relies not only on the long lifetimes of b and c hadrons but also on the full decay topology, it can help to discriminate b jets and c jets, for instance by separating b jets with cascade charm decays (i.e. at least 2 vertices) from single-vertex c jets. The neural network used for the IP3D+JetFitter combination has three output neurons: one for each of the light-quark, b and c hypotheses. The usual IP3D+JetFitter algorithm is built using the LLR of the light-flavour-jet and b-jet outputs. Figure 9 shows the c-jet rejection versus the b-jet tagging efficiency.

However, it can play an important role in topologies with lower transverse momenta of the final state objects or if some high transverse momentum objects are not reconstructed.

Figure 16 shows the rate with which secondary vertices are reconstructed by the SV1 algorithm in jets of different flavour, normalised to the average secondary vertex reconstruction rate. It can be seen that for c and b jets, where the reconstructed secondary vertices are mainly real vertices from decays of long-lived heavy hadrons, the secondary vertex rate is nearly independent of the number of pile-up interactions.

These differences are attributed to residual alignment uncertainties in data not present in simulation, as well as to imperfections in the cluster modelling in the pixel sensors in simulation.",

The p rel T templates for b and c jets are derived from the simulated \u00b5-jet sample, using muons associated with b and c jets, without requiring any b-tagging criteria. It has been verified that the pre-tagged and tagged template shapes agree within statistical uncertainties. The template for light-quark jets is derived from muons in jets in a light-flavour dominated data sample. The sample is constructed by requiring that no jet in the event is b-tagged by the IP3D+SV1 tagging algorithm, using an operating point that yields a b-jet tagging efficiency of approximately 80% in simulated tt events. This requirement rejects most events containing b jets and yields a sample dominated by c and light-flavour jets. The b-jet contamination in this sample varies between 2% and 6% depending on the p T bin. The small bias introduced in the measurement from the b-jet contamination in the light-template is corrected for in the final result.",

To study this effect, an independent jet axis was formed by the vector addition of the momenta of all tracks in the jet. The difference between this track-based and the standard calorimeter-based jet axis in the azimuthal angle \u03c6 and the pseudorapidity \u03b7, \u2206\u03c6(calo, track) and \u2206\u03b7(calo, track), was derived in both data and simulation. The difference between the track-based jet axis direction and the calorimeter-based jet axis direction is observed to be larger in data than in simulation, and the \u03c6 and \u03b7 of the calorimeter-based jet axis in simulation were therefore smeared such that the \u2206\u03c6(calo, track) and \u2206\u03b7(calo, track) distributions agreed better with those from data. No significant p T dependence of the difference between the widhts in data and simulation was observed, and a smearing based on a Gaussian distribution with a width of 0.004 in \u03c6 and 0.008 in \u03b7 was found to give good agreement between data and simulation in all bins of jet p T . The p rel T templates for b and c jets were rederived from this smeared sample, and the p rel T distribution in data was fitted using these altered templates. The difference between using the unsmeared and smeared jet directions is then taken as a systematic uncertainty.",

A systematic uncertainty that applies only to the p rel T analysis is the heavy-flavour contamination in the p rel T light-flavour data control sample, while a systematic uncertainty that only applies to the system8 analysis arises from varying the muon p rel T cut which is used as the soft muon tagging criterion.

This uncertainty on c-jet production is the dominant one for the p rel T analysis at high jet p T because gluon splitting is a larger contribution to the total charm production in this regime. Also, in this region the p rel T variable has a reduced discriminating power and hence the fit becomes more sensitive to a change in the shape of the c-jet template.

The relative fractions of c and light-flavour jets in these samples affect the correction factors related to non-b jets (\u03b1 2 , \u03b1 3 , \u03b1 4 and \u03b1 8 ). In both analyses the impact of the constrained charm-to-light ratio has been addressed by varying the ratio up and down by a factor of two. The charm-to-light ratio variation is one of the dominant systematic uncertainties in the p rel T analysis, especially in the highest p T bin where the band c-jet templates start to look very similar. The system8 analysis, which only relies on the p rel T cut to increase the fraction of b jets in the sample, is less affected.",

This filter suppresses b jets containing a reconstructed muon from other sources compared to those where the muon originated from a b decay (about 30% of the muons in this category, denoted as \"fake\" muons here, are indeed real muons produced by in-flight decays of light mesons; the remainder are not true muons). The fraction of fake muons in this sample is therefore likely to be lower than in data. As this could potentially impact the p rel T b template shapes, the p rel T measurement has been repeated with the fake muon fraction in the b template increased by a factor of three, which was found to have a negligible impact on the final result. In the system8 measurement, the fake muon contribution is varied in both b and c jets, again with a negligible impact on the final result. p rel T light-flavour-template contamination In the p rel T method, the templates for light-flavour jets are obtained from a light-flavour-enriched data sample. A measurement bias can arise from b-jet contamination in the light-flavour template. This b-jet contamination in the light-flavour template is estimated from simulation to be between 4% and 10%, depending on the jet p T bin. The bias introduced by this contamination is corrected for in the final result, and the result of a 25% relative variation of the b-jet contamination is taken as a systematic uncertainty. p rel T cut variation The system8 analysis uses a cut on the p rel T of the muon associated to the jet to arrive at a sample with enhanced heavy flavour content.

The procedure used is analogous to that used for the calibration of the c-jet tagging efficiency, which is described in a more formal way in section 12.5. For the following quantities, the simulation has been adjusted to available measurements [30]: b-hadron production fractions, branching fractions of semileptonic b-hadron decays, relative branching fractions of the dominant exclusive semileptonic b-hadron decays and topological branching fractions of c-hadron decays. These adjustments result in very small shifts (well below 1%) and, given the uncertainties of the measurements, negligible uncertainties on the ratio of tagging efficiencies for jets with semileptonic and inclusive b-hadron decays. The effect of gluon splitting to bb also has a direct impact on the b-jet tagging efficiency as predicted by the simulation. The variation mentioned before (assigning weights of zero or two) results in a small change of the b-jet tagging efficiency in simulation, with some -almost linear -dependence on jet p T . The charged particle multiplicity spectrum of b-hadron decays has a direct impact on the b-jet tagging efficiency, and variations of the charged particle multiplicity spectrum of hadronic b-hadron decays do not cancel in the ratio of relative tagging efficiencies. Since no dedicated measurements of the charged particle multiplicity spectrum of (hadronic) b-hadron decays for an admixture of b hadrons as present in high energy collisions are available,4 the potential effect has been studied by adjusting the charged particle spectrum to the one predicted by E G [32].5 This is the dominant effect on the extrapolation to inclusive b jets; the impact from these variations on the ratio of the relative differences in b-jet tagging efficiencies between semileptonic and hadronic b jets is typically a few percent (depending on the scenario). The jet p T dependence of this effect is negligible. Since these studies do not show a significant jet p T dependence, the uncertainty of 4% from the measurements of data-to-simulation scale factors in jets with and without muons is applied to all jet p T bins.",

The efficiency with which a b jet in data passes such a tagging requirement is determined in a three-step approach. Data-to-simulation scale factors for the efficiency to reconstruct a muon are obtained from a tag-and-probe method, as described in refs. [61,62]. The efficiency with which a reconstructed muon passes the SMT selection criteria is measured using a tag-and-probe method in samples of isolated muons produced in J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u00b5\u00b5 and Z \u2192 \u00b5\u00b5 decays as described in section 11.2. Finally, the probability that a b jet of a certain -64 -2016 JINST 11 P04008 p T and \u03b7 contains a reconstructed muon is derived from the same simulated tt sample used also in the tt-based b-jet efficiency measurements; systematic uncertainties are assigned to account for possible mismodelling of this probability. These three parts are then combined into a measurement of the SMT b-jet tagging efficiency.",

The jet energy in the simulated sample is corrected to match the scale and resolution observed in data, extracted from inclusive dijet samples and \u03b3/Z+jet samples [65]. A correction of the jet energy to account for the momentum of the neutrino and the muon in semileptonic b-hadron decays is also applied, using the same procedure and corrections as in section 8.5. Residual differences in the modelling of b decays (b-quark fragmentation and hadronisation), together with the kinematics of the hard scatter process, are accounted for by assigning systematic uncertainties derived from the comparison between the nominal simulated samples and alternative models.",

These were the transverse energy deposited in the calorimeter in cones of three different sizes (corresponding to opening angles of 0.2, 0.3 and 0.4 radians) around the central muon.7 The other isolation variables are the number of tracks and the summed p T of the tracks found in cones of the same size. While the statistics in the data sample is enough to cover a wide isolation range, the more limited statistics in the simulated sample does not allow to derive data-to-simulation scale factors for muons surrounded by a large amount of transverse energy or a large number of tracks. Within the range studied however, the data-to-simulation scale factor found is consistent with unity, meaning there is no dependence of the muon efficiency on the isolation of the probe muon. Thus no systematic uncertainty from this source has been assigned.",

The experimental uncertainty on each of these values [26] is propagated to the final result. The final uncertainty on the BF rescaling is larger at higher p jet T , due to the larger relative weight of decays through double charm creation (like b \u2192 cc \u2192 \u00b5), whose BF is known with a 30% accuracy. The \u03b7 and p T dependence of the SMT muon efficiency from the tag-and-probe method is shown in figures 40 and 41 for the J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u00b5\u00b5 and Z \u2192 \u00b5\u00b5 analyses respectively. In most of the \u03b7 range the data efficiency is lower than the efficiency predicted by simulation. Only in the range \u03b7 > 2 the simulation efficiency is significantly lower; the reason is a misconfiguration in these simulations. For the Z \u2192 \u00b5\u00b5 sample the SMT efficiency in simulation is otherwise independent of \u03b7 while in data there are variations of up to 8%. While the dependence on the transverse momentum in the -69 - J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u00b5\u00b5 sample is weak, there is a a strong p T dependence of the data-to-simulation scale factors in the Z \u2192 \u00b5\u00b5 sample which is caused by the sensitivity of the \u03c7 2 match cut to residual misalignments of the Muon Spectrometer relative to the inner tracker that are present in the data but not in the perfectly aligned simulation. The scale factors were found to exhibit no strong dependence on \u03c6. The b-jet tagging efficiency of the SMT algorithm as a function of the jet p T is shown in figure 42, where the simulation has been scaled with the muon reconstruction efficiency results from refs. [61,62] and the SMT muon efficiency calibration results from section 11.2. For the latter scaling, the J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u00b5\u00b5 (Z \u2192 \u00b5\u00b5) results are used for muon p T < 12 GeV (p T > 12 GeV). The green area indicates the statistical uncertainty summed in quadrature with the systematic uncertainties from the b-jet modelling presented in section 11.4.2 (with the exception of the uncertainty on the muon reconstruction efficiency) while the hashed area corresponds to the quadrature sum of the statistical uncertainty and the systematic uncertaintes on the muon reconstruction and SMT muon efficiencies. As analyses using the SMT tagging algorithm use the muon-based scale factors rather than the jet-based ones, no jet-based data-to-simulation scale factors are presented here.",

In proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of \u221a s = 7 TeV, the dominant production mechanism is gs \u2192 W \u2212 c and gs \u2192 W +c , where the W boson is always accompanied by a c quark of opposite charge.

An estimate for the scale factor extrapolation factor \u03b4 is then obtained from Given that the b-tagging algorithms exploit track and vertex properties that can specifically be associated with band c-hadron decays, it is important that these are well modelled by MC simulations. This applies in particular to the charged particle decay multiplicity of c-hadron decays. In order to improve its description in the PYTHIA-default simulation the relative branching fractions of the dominant semileptonic decay channels of the abundant D + and D 0 mesons are corrected to match the world average values [30]. The less frequent decay channels of the two mesons, which are known to a lower precision, are adjusted to maintain the overall normalisation. It is found that the relative fractions of D + decays with one and three charged decay products have a noticeable impact on the c-jet tagging efficiency of SMT c jets. Also the hadronic n-prong branching fractions of c hadrons in the PYTHIA-default sample are corrected with a significant impact on the predicted c-jet tagging efficiency of an inclusive c-jet sample. While the corrections in case of the D 0 meson have been inferred from measured inclusive n-prong branching fractions [30], the hadronic n-prong branching fractions of the D + and D s mesons as well as the \u039b + c baryon are re-weighted to the predictions of the E G simulation. A comparison of the PYTHIA-default and E G predictions, as well as the measured values in case of the D 0 meson, reveals large differences in the hadronic nprong distributions. In particular the 2-to-0-prong ratio of the D 0 meson and the 3-to-1-prong ratio of the D + meson are found to have a significant influence on the inclusive c-jet tagging efficiency.",

Signal and background regions are defined as the region within 3\u03c3 of the \u2206m peak value and the region above 150 MeV, respectively. The choice of the \u2206m intervals for the signal and background -83 -regions aims at including almost all the signal events in the signal region and ensuring a negligible fraction of signal events in the background region. For each observable, the data distribution extraction is carried out as follows: the distribution of events from the background region, normalised to the fitted background fraction in the signal region, is subtracted from the corresponding distribution in the signal region. The procedure relies on the assumption that the distribution of the observable of interest is the same for the combinatorial background under the peak and in the sidebands. This assumption has been verified to be valid in simulated events. It is further supported by the observation in data that the distributions obtained from two different contiguous sideband regions (\u2206m \u2208 [150, 160] MeV and \u2206m \u2208 [160, 168] MeV) are compatible with each other within their statistical uncertainty.",

For the SV0 algorithm, which is a basic secondary vertex based algorithm where the tag weight w is the signed decay length significance of the reconstructed secondary vertex, a jet is considered negatively tagged if it contains a secondary vertex with decay length significance w < \u2212w cut rather than decay length significance w > w cut , where w cut is the reference weight cut value for a particular efficiency. For advanced tagging algorithms, based on likelihood ratios or neural networks, the negative tag rate is instead computed in a more complex way, defining a negative version of the tagging algorithm which internally reverses the impact parameter and the decay length selections. For such algorithms, a jet is considered negatively tagged if it has a negative tag weight w neg > w cut rather than the standard w > w cut . Figure 53 shows the tag weight distribution of the SV0 algorithm, as well as the standard and negative weight distributions for the IP3D+JetFitter algorithm. For the SV0 algorithm and for not too large weights (for reference a 50% b-jet efficiency is obtained with a requirement w > 5.65), the tag weight distribution is almost symmetric about zero for light-flavour jets, and the negative side of the tag weight distribution is dominated by light-flavour jets. For the IP3D+JetFitter algorithm, the standard and negative tag weight distributions for light-flavour jets are similar in shape, while the tag weight distributions for b and c jets differ substantially. For reference the weight cut value w for the IP3D+JetFitter algorithm, corresponding to a b-jet efficiency of 70%, is 0.35. The mistag rate \u03b5 l is then approximated by the negative tag rate of the inclusive jet sample, \u03b5 neg inc . The approximation would be exact if the negative tag weight distribution is identical for all jet flavours and is identical to the normal tag weight distribution. In reality, two correction factors are applied to relate \u03b5 neg inc to \u03b5 l . -92 -However, effects like the finite jet direction resolution can flip the sign of the discriminating variable, increasing significantly the negative tag rate for b and c jets.

A higher track multiplicity implies a larger probability of accidentally tagging a light-flavour jet as a b jet for purely combinatorial reasons. The systematic uncertainty in the negative tag analysis due to the track multiplicity is estimated by reweighting the jet sample according to the ratio of distributions of the number of tracks associated to jets in data and simulation. The effect of the track multiplicity reweighting ranges between approximately 5% at low jet p T and over 40% at high jet p T in the forward region. The track multiplicity systematic uncertainty affects the higher jet p T bins more because the discrepancy between data and simulation is larger in this region, presumably due to an imperfect modelling of track reconstruction in the core of high-p T jets in simulated events as well as to an imperfect description of the track multiplicities over a wide range of jet transverse momenta in the generator.",

The most performant single algorithm is based on the complete reconstruction of the b-hadron decay chain involving secondary and tertiary decay vertices. This technique is used for the first time at a hadron collider experiment. To obtain the best possible performance, several b-tagging algorithms have been combined using multivariate analysis techniques like neural networks and boosted decision trees. The choice of a certain working point corresponding to a certain b-jet tagging efficiency and rejection of non-b jets allows to adapt the use of the b-tagging information to the needs of specific physics analyses.

For kinematic properties of jets that are particularly favourable for b-tagging -in the central region of the detector and for jet transverse momenta around 80-150 GeV -the rejection of light-flavour jets reaches values above 300.",

            "text": "To calibrate the efficiency of the lifetime-based tagging algorithms to tag b jets two classes of events have been used. The first one is composed of QCD jet events containing a jet with an identified muon inside. Such a sample is enriched with b jets in which a semileptonic b-hadron decay has occurred. Two methods, p rel T and system8, allow a measurement of the b-jet tagging efficiency of lifetime-based algorithms up to jet transverse momenta of 200 GeV with statistical (systematic) uncertainties in the range of 1.5% to 4% (5% to 7%). The second class of events are selected tt events, which naturally have a high b-jet content, containing either one or two isolated leptons from the decays of W bosons. Several calibration methods are exploited for these samples. The tag counting method is based on the number of identified b jets in each event, while the kinematic selection method exploits the fraction of jets in a b-enriched sample that are identified as b jets. The combinatorial likelihood method increases the precision by exploiting the kinematic correlations between the jets while the kinematic fit method makes use of a kinematic fit to the tt system to identify the b jets. The tt-based measurements allow to extend the calibration -102 -analyses to jet transverse momenta of 300 GeV. Typical statistical (systematic) uncertainties for the combinatorial likelihood method range from 2% to 8% (2% to 8%). The p rel T method has also been applied to tt events, yielding results compatible with those from the method applied to dijet events, albeit with larger statistical and systematic uncertainties.",

The first one is based on a sample where a c jet -identified through a semileptonic decay of a c hadron into a muon -is produced in association with a W boson. Exploiting the correlation of the charges between the muon in the c jet and the W boson provides a c-jet sample with very high purity. The resulting c-jet tagging efficiency scale factors have uncertainties between 5% and 13%, depending on the chosen b-tagging operating point. The second method is based on the exclusive reconstruction of the decay D + \u2192 D 0 (K \u2212 \u03c0 + )\u03c0 + which allows to define a sample of c jets after the subtraction of the b-jet contribution. The statistical and systematic uncertainties on the data-to-simulation scale factors are about 10% and between 10% and 20%, respectively. Since both methods are based on sub-samples of specific c-hadron decays, a consistent procedure has been developed to obtain results valid for an inclusive sample of c jets. These two methods have been adopted for the first time to measure the efficiencies of b-tagging algorithms for c jets.",

By correcting the semileptonic branching fractions of c hadrons to match the world average values[30], also the modelling of the c-hadron composition in the simulated SMT c-jet sample is improved. Comparing the c-hadron fractions in the SMT c-jet sample with the ones in the inclusive c-jet sample shows that the D + -meson component is strongly enhanced in the SMT c-jet sample due to its relatively large semileptonic branching fraction: the SMT c-jet sample consists of a similar amount (\u223c 43 %) of D 0 and D + mesons, while in the inclusive c-jet sample the D 0 meson is clearly the dominant c-hadron type (\u223c 60 %).",
