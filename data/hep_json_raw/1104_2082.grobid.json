Using 5.0 fb \u22121 of data the combined significance of both B \u2212 \u2192 D 0 \u03c0/K signals exceeds 5 sigma. First results in hadron collisions, obtained on 1.0 fb \u22121 of data using the method of Gronau, London and Wyler (GLW) for the Cabibbo suppressed modes are also reported. Both ADS and GLW parameters are determined with accuracy comparable with B factories measurements.",

            "text": "The measurement of the CKM matrix elements plays a central role both to test the Standard Model consistency and to probe New Physics scenarios. In particular the complex phase of the CKM matrix leads to CP violation in weak processes. Conventionally, CP violating observables are written in terms of the angles \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3 of the \"Unitarity Triangle\", obtained from the unitarity condition of the CKM matrix [1]. While the resolution on \u03b1 and \u03b2 reached a good level of precision, the measurement of \u03b3 is still limited by the smallness of the branching ratios involved in the processes [2,3,4]. Written in terms of the CKM elements, \u03b3 is equal to arg(\u2212V ud V * ub /V cd V * cb ) and is related to the element V ub though V ub = |V ub |e \u2212i\u03b3 [5]. Among the various methods for the \u03b3 measurement, those which make use of the tree-level B \u2212 \u2192 D 0 K \u2212 decays have the smallest theoretical uncertanties [6,7,8]. In fact \u03b3 appears as the relative weak phase between two amplitudes, the favored b \u2192 c\u016bs transition of the B \u2212 \u2192 D 0 K \u2212 , whose amplitude is proportional to V cb V us , and the color-suppressed b \u2192 ucs transition of the B \u2212 \u2192 D 0 K \u2212 , whose amplitude is proportional Fig. 1. The interference between D 0 and D 0 , decaying into the same final state, leads to measurable CP violation effects, from which \u03b3 can be extracted. The effects can be also enhanced choosing the interfering amplitudes of the same order of magnitude. According to the final state of the D 0 we can have the following methods:",

The detector [12] is a multipurpose magnetic spectrometer surrounded by calorimeters and muon detectors. The most relevant for B-physics are the tracking, the particle-identification (PID) detectors and the trigger system. The tracking system provides a determination of the decay point of particles with 15 \u00b5m resolution in the transverse plane using six layers of double-sided silicon-microstrip sensors at radii between 2.5 and 22 cm from the beam. A 96-layer drift chamber extending radially from 40 to 140 cm from the beam provides the reconstruction of three-dimensional chargedparticles trajectories and excellent transverse momentum resolution, \u03c3 p T /p 2 T = 0.1% Gev/c 2 . Specific ionization measurements in the chamber allow 1.5\u03c3 separation between charged kaons and pions, approximately constant at momenta larger than 2 GeV/c. A three-level trigger system [11] selects events enriched in decays of long-lived particles by exploiting the presence of displaced tracks in the event and measuring their impact parameter with offline-like 30 \u00b5m resolution. The trigger requires the presence of two charged particles with transverse momenta greater than 2 GeV/c, impact parameters greater than 100 microns and basic cuts on azimuthal separation and scalar sum of momenta.",

For this reason an important point of this analysis is the suppression of the combinatorial background, obtained through a cuts optimization focused on finding a signal of the B \u2192 D DCS \u03c0 mode. Since the B \u2192 D CF \u03c0 mode has the same topology of the DCS one, but more statistic, we did the optimization using signal (S) and background (B) directly from CF data, choosing a set of cuts which maximize the figure of merit S/(1.5 + \u221a B) [13]. The offline cut on the tridimensional vertex quality \u03c7 2 3D and the B isolation are powerful handles among the variables used in the optimization. The first exploit the 3D silicon-tracking to resolve multiple vertices along the beam direction and to reject fake tracks. It allows a background reduction by a factor of two and has small inefficiency on signal (less than 10%). The B isolation corresponds to the fraction of momentum carried by the B meson, which is usually greater than the momentum carried by lighter mesons. Another important cut is on the decay lenght of the D 0 with respect to the B, which allows to reject most of the B \u2192 hhh backgrounds, where h is either \u03c0 or K. All variables and threshold values applied are described in [14].",

We obtained 34 \u00b1 14 B \u2192 D DCS K and 73 \u00b1 16 B \u2192 D DCS \u03c0 signal events. Since K + and K \u2212 have a different probability of interaction in the detector, we evaluated the efficiency using a simulation sample and we corrected the fit results with this value. The final results for the asymmetries are:  ",
