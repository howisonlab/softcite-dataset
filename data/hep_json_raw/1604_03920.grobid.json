A study of K + production is complementary because of differences in the nuclear interaction due to strangeness conservation. Previous measurements of neutrino-induced charged-current K + production have been carried out in bubble chambers with very limited statistics [4][5][6][7]. We report the first high-statistics measurement of this process based on a sample of 1755 selected event candidates, of which 885 are estimated to be charged-current K + events with T K < 600 MeV.",

The simplest minimal supersymmetric models [8,9] give proton lifetimes that have been excluded by experiment. However, other models [10][11][12][13][14][15] allow proton lifetimes greater than 10 34 years, consistent with the current experimental lower bound of 5.6\u00d710 33 years from a 260 kiloton-year exposure by Super-Kamiokande [16]. The K + from proton decay is below Cherenkov threshold in water, but a liquid argon time projection chamber such as DUNE [17] is able to reconstruct the K + momentum precisely. The K + momentum spectrum in p \u2192 K + \u03bd depends on the momentum distribution of the initial-state protons inside the nucleus. A related issue is the extent to which K + mesons born inside the nucleus experience final-state interactions (FSI) as they emerge into the detector medium. Kaons produced by neutrinos are subject to the same interactions. Measuring K + production by neutrinos on carbon is a first step toward understanding the spectrum for p \u2192 K + \u03bd in the argon of the DUNE far detector.",

Absorption is the dominant feature in the pion-nucleus inelastic cross section at pion kinetic energies in the few 100s of MeV. In K \u2212nucleus scattering, the K \u2212 can be absorbed, converting a bound nucleon into a hyperon. The analogous process for K + -nucleus scattering is forbidden because there are no antibaryons in the nucleus. A K + produced inside the nucleus will exit unless it charge exchanges to a K 0 . In addition, K + can be produced in \u03c0 + -nucleus reactions by strong processes such as \u03c0 + n \u2192 K + \u039b. In the Giessen Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck model [18], this kind of reaction gives an enhancement to the K + production cross section at low K + momentum. In genie [19], the event generator used by MINERvA and many other experiments, 13% of K + produced in carbon reinteract before exiting the nucleus, distorting the spectrum toward lower kaon energies. genie does not include K + production either by pions or charge exchange in its FSI model. This paper reports a measurement at high statistics of inclusive charged-current K + production by muon neutrinos, \u03bd \u00b5 CH \u2192 \u00b5 \u2212 K + X. The differential cross section in K + kinetic energy is measured and compared to predictions of current neutrino event generators with and without FSI treatments.",

A parameterization based on Koba-Nielsen-Olese (KNO) scaling [33] is used for 1.7 < W < 2.3 GeV and PYTHIA6 [34] is used for W > 3.0 GeV. In the intermediate region 2.3 < W < 3.0 GeV, the AGKY model [35] governs the transition between KNO and PYTHIA6. Parameters which control the rate of strange particle production in hadronization are tuned such that rates of \u039b and K 0 S production on deuterium and nuclei agree with BEBC [36][37][38][39] and Fermilab 15' [40,41] bubble chamber measurements as a function of W . All events in genie 2.8.4 are \u2206S = 0, so there is always another strange particle in the final state in addition to the K + .",

Scattering on other nuclei in the tracker is reweighted based on the carbon data and A-dependent nuclear effects are not considered.

The reference time is determined by fitting the timing profile of hundreds of hits along the track, and is known to within 1 ns. Corrections are applied to the hit times to account for muon time-of-flight, light time-of-flight in the optical fiber, timing offsets inherent to the electronics, and the expected delay between the energy deposit and the earliest decay of the scintillator and fiber. The probability density functions for hits in three different pulse height bins are shown in Fig. 2. The light time-of-flight correction assumes that the earliest photoelectron is the result of light that traveled directly from the muon energy deposit to the PMT. Especially for low pulse height hits, it is possible that all photoelectrons result from light that first reflected off the mirrored end of the optical fiber. This gives rise to a high-side tail in Fig. 2 that reduces with increasing PE.",

If the K + stops in the hadronic calorimeter, 90% of the energy from its decay products is deposited in passive material and the K + cannot be reliably reconstructed. Non-interacting kaons with more than 600 MeV of kinetic energy typically reach the hadronic calorimeter and cannot be reconstructed using this timing-based technique. High-energy kaons are reconstructed only when they interact inelastically inside the tracker, in which case the range-based kinetic energy measurement is poor. The differential cross section will be presented from 0 to 500 MeV of K + kinetic energy. The timing signature reconstruction begins with a search for activity in the detector that is delayed in time with respect to the neutrino interaction, consistent with the 12.4 ns K + lifetime, and consistent in energy with the products of a K + decay-at-rest. First, we search for a fully-reconstructed K + \u2192 \u00b5 + decay. Using only topological information, we find tracks which kink, using an algorithm described in Ref. [21].",

While the dominant effect is from the overall flux normalization, uncertainties in the flux shape enter the analysis through the background subtraction. The background model uncertainty is dominated by a 100% uncertainty on pion-carbon interactions inside MINERvA that produce kaons, which are simulated by Geant4 and not constrained by external data. The sideband with high hadronic energy constrains these events, together with high-energy K + from signal reactions. An uncertainty arises due to the difference in the relative contribution to the signal region and non-kaon hadronic visible energy sideband region from these types of events, which can be seen in Table III. Uncertainties in the genie FSI model are evaluated by varying its parameters within measured uncertainties [49,50].
