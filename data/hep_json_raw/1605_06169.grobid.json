We observe no deviations from standard neutrino mixing, and thus place constraints on the non-standard interaction matter effect, |\u03b5e\u03c4 |, and phase, (\u03b4CP + \u03b4e\u03c4 ), using a thirty-bin likelihood fit. Results from solar, atmospheric, reactor and accelerator experiments [1][2][3][4][5][6][7] demonstrate that neutrinos undergo flavor change as they propagate. This phenomenon is well described by a quantum mechanical mixing of the neutrino flavors. In the standard three-flavor oscillation model, this process can be parameterized by three angles, \u03b8 12 , \u03b8 13 , \u03b8 23 , and a CP-violating phase, \u03b4 CP [8]. Electron neutrinos and antineutrinos propagating through matter are subjected to the Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein (MSW) effect [9], which arises from forward coherent scattering with electrons in media. While this process itself does not change lepton flavor, the scattering modifies the probabilities for neutrinos to oscillate between flavor states.",

Charged particles are subsequently focused by a pair of currentpulsed aluminum horns, and the decays of these particles in a 675 m decay pipe yield neutrinos. Remaining hadrons are captured by an absorber at the end of the decay pipe, and muons are removed from the beam by 240 meters of rock that separate the absorber from the detector hall.

            "text": "A fast matrix multiplication method was introduced to the \u03bd e analysis software to calculate the exact oscillation probabilities, as opposed to using channel-by-channel approximations. In this paper, we show results in terms of |\u03b5 e\u03c4 | and an effective phase, (\u03b4 CP + \u03b4 e\u03c4 ). The use of this phase was motivated by the MINOS+T2K combined analysis [18], where it was demonstrated that the \u03bd e appearance probability can be represented in terms of (\u03b4 CP + \u03b4 e\u03c4 ) in the limit of \u2206m 2 21 /\u2206m 2 31 \u2192 0. Here, we maintain the use of this phase to simplify the presentation of the results even though we have implemented an exact probability calculation that treats all of the oscillation parameters (including NSI) independently. The results presented here are based upon exposures of 10.6 \u00d7 10 20 protons-on-target (POT) in neutrino mode and 3.3 \u00d7 10 20 POT in antineutrino mode. These data were previously analyzed in the first joint \u03bd e + \u03bd e appearance search [22].",

The cut on \u03b1 LEM was established in [22] through the assessment of different binning schemes and the resulting sensitivities to \u03b8 13 . Assuming a three-flavor neutrino oscillation model that includes the Hamiltonian perturbation from Eq. (1), we probe the |\u03b5 e\u03c4 |, (\u03b4 CP + \u03b4 e\u03c4 ) parameter space by comparing predicted FD event counts with those observed. A simultaneous fit of the neutrino and antineutrino data is performed using a 30 bin scheme. Each configuration is represented by 15 bins with three divisions of \u03b1 LEM > 0.6 and five divisions that span a reconstructed neutrino energy range of 1-8 GeV. Reconstructed energy distributions, shown in Fig. 1, compare three FD Monte Carlo predictions that illustrate standard and non-standard oscillations. Figure 2 shows the reconstructed energy distributions for data, the standard oscillation prediction, and the NSIallowed best-fit prediction. The divisions of \u03b1 LEM , the splitting of neutrino and antineutrino modes, and the reconstructed energy range of the shown histograms are representative of the binning scheme used in the fit.",

All of the produced likelihood surfaces were represented in terms of (\u03b4 CP + \u03b4 e\u03c4 ), and the contours for each hierarchy were generated by sampling the surfaces for different values of \u03b4 CP to determine the most conservative result. Statistical and systematic uncertainties on the FD prediction were taken into account when assessing the contours. In this analysis, the handling of nuisance parameters corresponding to systematic errors and oscillation parameters is identical to the prescription in [22] with one notable exception.   The mean values and uncertainties placed upon the nuisance parameters in the fit, with respective references shown. Oscillation parameters with mass hierarchy dependent selections are designated with (NH) or (IH) for normal or inverted hierarchy, respectively. We conservatively treat the 90% C.L. of the NSI parameters as the uncertainties in our fit. Both \u03b4e\u00b5 and \u03b4\u00b5\u03c4 are explicitly set to zero. The inclusion of negative values of \u03b5 \u03b1\u03b2 is equivalent to shifting the corresponding phases by \u03c0 radians. We note that through this method the fit spans the full range of how these parameters impact the \u03bde and \u03bde appearance rates.  To account for the uncertainties on the oscillation parameters, templates were introduced to the fitting framework that treat \u03b8 23 , \u2206m 2 32 , and five of the NSI \u03b5 \u03b1\u03b2 terms as nuisance parameters. The mean values and uncertainties, taken from external data, of the nuisance parameters used in the fit are included in Table I. The templates were made by storing the changes in the FD prediction induced by \u00b11\u03c3 shifts on the selected oscillation parameters in each bin of reconstructed energy and \u03b1 LEM . These templates cover the range of allowed spectra, including those produced through the interplay of the NSI parameters. The stored predictions improved the efficiency of the fit by shortening the amount of time needed to evaluate the likelihood at each point in the parameter space. Central values and limits were taken from [26] for \u03b8 13 ; from [27] for the other standard oscillation parameters; from [13], for \u03b5 \u00b5\u03c4 ; and from [12] for the other \u03b5 \u03b1\u03b2 coefficients.",
