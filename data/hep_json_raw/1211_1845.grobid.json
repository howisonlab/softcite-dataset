The measurement is done with the KLOE detector at the \u03c6-factory DA\u03a6NE with an integrated luminosity of 0.24 fb \u22121 . The e + e \u2212 \u2192 e + e \u2212 \u03b7 cross section is measured without detecting the outgoing electron and positron, selecting the decays \u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 and \u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 . The most relevant background is due to e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b7\u03b3 when the monochromatic photon escapes detection. The cross section for this process is measured as \u03c3(e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b7\u03b3) = (856 \u00b1 8 stat \u00b1 16 syst ) pb. The combined result for the e + e \u2212 \u2192 e + e \u2212 \u03b7 cross section is \u03c3(e + e \u2212 \u2192 e + e \u2212 \u03b7) = (32.72 \u00b1 1.27 stat \u00b1 0.70 syst ) pb. From this we derive the partial width \u0393(\u03b7 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3) = (520 \u00b1 20 stat \u00b1 13 syst ) eV. This is in agreement with the world average and is the most precise measurement to date.",

            "text": "Photon-photon production of neutral mesons provides basic information on their structure. The strength of the coupling, measured by the partial decay width \u0393(X \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3), is related to the quark content of the meson and gives information on the relations between the hadronic state and its qq representation. For the light pseudoscalar mesons \u03c0 0 , \u03b7 and \u03b7 \u2032 , the coupling to real photons is measured in their \u03b3\u03b3 decays, while the coupling to space-like photons can be measured in \u03b3\u03b3 interactions. This is of particular interest in evaluating the light-by-light contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon [1]. Photonphoton interactions in electron-positron colliders were pioneered at the Frascati collider Adone in the \u2032 70s [2][3][4] and since then have been used to study the production of hadrons in almost all e + e \u2212 colliders in a variety of conditions in low-and high-q 2 processes [5][6][7].",

Figure 3 shows the distribution of \u03c7 2 \u03b7 from the kinematic fit for MC signal events and for data. We require \u03c7 2 \u03b7 < 20 to reduce the \u03b7(\u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 )\u03b3 background. This process has a long tail in the \u03c7 2 \u03b7 distribution due to events with the monochromatic photon in the detector acceptance and one photon from the \u03c0 0 decay undetected, that are not rejected by the \u03c7 2 \u03b3\u03b3 < 8 requirement.  At this stage of the selection, radiative Bhabha scattering, e + e \u2212 \u2192 e + e \u2212 \u03b3, and e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 annihilation followed by photon conversion are still a source of background. Separation of charged pion from electron/positron tracks is done using a likelihood method when a cluster is associated to the track [33]. A cluster is associated if the distance between the centroid and the extrapolation of the track to the calorimeter wall is less than 50 cm. The e-\u03c0 likelihood is based on three variables: i) the difference of time of flight, ii) the energy of the cluster; iii) the fractions of energy deposited in the first and in the fifth calorimeter layers. In this analysis events with a cluster associated to each track and a value of the likelihood estimator log L \u03c0 /L e < 0 for both clusters are rejected. The background from e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 annihilation is reduced requiring that the most energetic cluster satisfies the conditions E \u03b31 < 230 MeV and 27.5",

In the following analysis we select events with \u03c7 2 6\u03b3 < 14. A kinematic fit is done requiring the 6\u03b3 invariant mass to be equal to the \u03b7 mass. In the fit the energies, E i , the times, t i , and the coordinates of the centroid positions x i , y i , z i , for the six clusters are varied. There are seven constraints: the promptness of the six clusters t i \u2212 r i /c = 0 and m 6\u03b3 = m \u03b7 . Figure 6 shows the distribution of \u03c7 2 \u03b7 from the kinematic fit for MC signal events and for data, we require \u03c7 2 \u03b7 < 20 to reduce the background. MC simulation shows that e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b7\u03b3 gives a large contribution to the tail of the distribution when the monochromatic photon is in the acceptance and is wrongly paired with a photon from \u03b7 decay. In this case it also produces an enhancement at large values of the 6\u03b3 invariant mass distribution. To reduce the background we require the highest energy neutral cluster to have E \u03b31 < 260 MeV and the six-photon invariant mass m 6\u03b3 < 630 MeV. ",

The event selection aims at finding two tracks of opposite curvature, compatible with being due to \u03c0 \u00b1 , two neutral prompt clusters compatible with being originated by a \u03c0 0 decay, and a third neutral prompt cluster compatible with the photon recoiling against the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 system. Several background processes have been considered. e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c9\u03c0 0 with \u03c9 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 is characterized by two tracks and four photons and can simulate the signal if one photon is not detected. e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 \u03b3 has the same configuration as the signal. e + e \u2212 \u2192 K L K S can mimic the signal when K L decays to \u03c0 \u00b1 \u2113 \u2213 \u03bd close to the collision point and K S decays to \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 but one photon is not detected. e + e \u2212 \u2192 K + K \u2212 can mimic the signal when both kaons decay close to the collision point to \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03c0 0 , \u03c0 \u2213 \u03c0 0 and one photon is not detected, or decay to \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03c0 0 , \u00b5 \u2213 \u03bd and the additional photon originates from split or accidental clusters. e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 and e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b3 can mimic the signal in case of one or two accidental or split clusters. e + e \u2212 \u2192 e + e \u2212 \u03b3 has a very large cross section and can be an important background if the electron (positron) is misidentified as a pion and the two additional photons originate from split or accidental clusters. e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 has also a large cross section and may originate background in case of photon conversions and there are split or accidental clusters. Beside these, \u03b7\u03b3 production with \u03b7 decaying to \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b3 or to 3\u03c0 0 should be discriminated from the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 signal by the number of prompt neutral clusters.",

These backgrounds are reduced by requiring for the sum of the track momenta | p + | + | p \u2212 | < 440 MeV. The effect of these cuts is controlled by the distribution of the energy of the unpaired photon shown in figure 10 where E \u03b33 is the value returned by the fit and has a resolution greatly improved by the good time and position resolution of the calorimeter. The peaks at the energies of the photon recoiling against the \u03c9 and the \u03b7 are clearly visible over a small background at E \u03b33 = 194 MeV and E \u03b33 = 350 MeV, respectively.",

The \u03b7 mesons are selected using the two decays \u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 and \u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 that exploit in a complementary way the tracking and the calorimeter measurements. Many background processes are considered, the most relevant being e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b7\u03b3 when the photon is emitted at small polar angles and escapes detection. As a consistency check, we have measured the cross section for e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b7\u03b3 in two independent ways, the two values agree well with each other and we derive \u03c3(e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b7\u03b3) = (856 \u00b1 8 stat \u00b1 16 syst ) pb.
