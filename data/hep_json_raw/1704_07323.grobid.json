The data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 , and a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The properties of the events are consistent with expectations from standard model processes, and no excess yield is observed. Exclusion limits at 95% confidence level are set on cross sections for the pair production of gluinos, squarks, and same-sign top quarks, as well as top-quark associated production of a heavy scalar or pseudoscalar boson decaying to top quarks, and on the standard model production of events with four top quarks. The observed lower mass limits are as high as 1500 GeV for gluinos, 830 GeV for bottom squarks. The excluded mass range for heavy (pseudo)scalar bosons is 350-360 (350-410) GeV. Additionally, model-independent limits in several topological regions are provided, allowing for further interpretations of the results.",

Because the SM rates of SS dileptons are low, studies of these final states provide excellent opportunities to search for manifestations of physics beyond the standard model (BSM). Over the last decades, a large number of new physics mechanisms have been proposed to extend the SM and address its shortcomings. Many of these can give rise to potentially large contributions to the SS dilepton signature, e.g., the production of supersymmetric (SUSY) particles [1,2], SS top quarks [3,4], scalar gluons (sgluons) [5,6], heavy scalar * e-mail: cms-publication-committee-chair@cern.ch bosons of extended Higgs sectors [7,8], Majorana neutrinos [9], and vector-like quarks [10].",

For example, a pair of gluinos (which are Majorana particles) can give rise to SS charginos and up to four top quarks, yielding signatures with up to four W bosons, as well as jets, b quark jets, and large missing transverse momentum (E miss T ). Similar signatures can also result from the pair production of bottom squarks, subsequently decaying to charginos and top quarks.",

New physics signal samples, as well as the same-sign W \u00b1 W \u00b1 process, are generated with MadGraph5_amc@nlo at leading order (LO) precision, with up to two additional partons in the matrix element calculations, using the NNPDF3.0 LO [38] PDFs. Parton showering and hadronization, as well as the double-parton scattering production of W \u00b1 W \u00b1 , are described using the pythia 8.205 generator [39] with the CUETP8M1 tune [40,41]. The Geant4 package [42] is used to model the CMS detector response for background samples, while the CMS fast simulation package [43] is used for signal samples.",

The same reweighting procedure is applied to SUSY MC events. The reweighting factors vary between 0.92 and 0.51 for N ISR J between 1 and 6.

In each of the simplified SUSY models [44,45] of Fig. 1, only two or three new particles have masses sufficiently low to be produced on-shell, and the branching fraction for the decays shown are assumed to be 100%. Gluino pair production models giving rise to signatures with up to four b quarks and up to four W bosons are shown in Fig. 1a-e. In these models, the gluino decays to the lightest squark ( g \u2192 qq), which in turn decays to same-flavor ( q \u2192 q \u03c7 0 1 ) or different-flavor ( q \u2192 q \u03c7 \u00b1 1 ) quarks. The chargino decays to a W boson and a neutralino ( \u03c7 \u00b1 1 \u2192 W \u00b1 \u03c7 0 1 ), where the \u03c7 0 1 escapes detection and is taken to be the lightest SUSY particle (LSP). The first two scenarios considered in Fig. 1a the gluino, g \u2192 tt \u03c7 0 1 (T1tttt) and g \u2192 tb \u03c7 + 1 (T5ttbbWW), resulting in events with four W bosons and four b quarks. In the T5ttbbWW model, the mass splitting between chargino and neutralino is set to m \u03c7 \u00b1 1 \u2212 m \u03c7 0 1 = 5 GeV, so that two of the W bosons are produced off-shell and can give rise to low transverse momentum ( p T ) leptons. The next two models shown ( Fig. 1c, d) include an on-shell top squark with different mass splitting between the t and the \u03c7 0 1 , and consequently different decay modes: in the T5tttt model the mass splitting is equal to the top quark mass",

Events passing the baseline selection are then divided into SRs to separate the different background processes and to maximize the sensitivity to signatures with different jet multiplicity (N jets ), flavor (N b ), visible and invisible energy (H T and E miss T ), and lepton momentum spectra (the HH/HL/LL categories mentioned previously). The m min T variable is defined as the smallest of the transverse masses constructed between p miss T and each of the leptons. This variable features a cutoff near the W boson mass for processes with only one prompt lepton, so it is used to create SRs where the nonprompt lepton background is negligible. To further improve sensitivity, several regions are split according to the charge of the leptons (++ or \u2212\u2212), taking advantage of the charge asymmetry of SM backgrounds, such as ttW or WZ, with a single W boson produced in pp collisions. Only signal regions dominated by such backgrounds and with a sufficient predicted yield are split by charge.

The tight-to-loose method uses two control regions, the measurement region and the application region. The measurement region consists of a sample of single-lepton events enriched in nonprompt leptons by requirements on E miss T and transverse mass that suppress the W \u2192 \u03bd contribution. This sample is used to extract the probability for a nonprompt lepton that satisfies the loose selection to also satisfy the tight selection. This probability ( TL ) is calculated as a function of lepton p corr T (defined below) and \u03b7, separately for electrons and muons, and separately for lepton triggers with and without an isolation requirement. The application region is a SS dilepton region where both of the leptons satisfy the loose selection but at least one of them fails the tight selection. This region is subsequently divided into a set of subregions with the exact same kinematic requirements as those in the SRs. Events in the subregions are weighted by a factor TL /(1 \u2212 TL ) for each lepton in the event failing the tight requirement. The nonprompt background in each SR is then estimated as the sum of the event weights in the corresponding subregion. The p corr T parametrization, where p corr T is defined as the lepton p T plus the energy in the isolation cone exceeding the isolation threshold value, is chosen because of its correlation with the parent parton p T , improving the stability of the TL values with respect to the sample kinematics. To improve the stability of the TL values with respect to the flavor of the parent parton, the loose electron selection is adopted. This selection increases the number of nonprompt electrons from the fragmentation and decay of light-flavor partons, resulting in TL values similar to those from heavy-flavor parent partons.",

When testing a model, all new particles not included in the specific model are considered too heavy to take part in the interaction. To convert cross section limits into mass limits, the signal cross sections specified in Sect. 2 are used. The observed SUSY cross section limits as a function of the gluino and LSP masses, as well as the observed and expected mass limits for each simplified model, are shown in Fig. 5 for gluino pair production models with each gluino decaying through a chain containing off-or on-shell thirdgeneration squarks. These models, which result in signatures with two or more b quarks and two or more W bosons in the final state, are introduced in Sect. 2 as T1tttt, T5ttbbWW, T5tttt, and T5ttcc. Figure 6 shows the limits for a model of gluino production followed by a decay through off-shell first-or second-generation squarks and a chargino. Two different assumptions are made on the chargino mass, taken to be between that of the gluino and the LSP. These T5qqqqWW models result in no b quarks and either on-shell or off-shell W bosons. Bottom squark pair production followed by a decay through a chargino, T6ttWW, resulting in two b quarks and four W bosons, is shown in Fig. 7. For all of the models probed, the observed limit agrees well with the expected one, extending the reach of the previous analysis by 200-300 GeV and reaching 1.5, 1.1, and 0.83 TeV for gluino, LSP, and bottom squark masses, respectively.",

To facilitate such reinterpretations, we provide limits on the number of SS dilepton pairs as a function of the E miss T and H T thresholds in the The E miss T and H T limits are based on combining HH tail SRs, specifically SR42-45 for high E miss T and SR46-51 for high H T , and employing the CL s criterion without the asymptotic formulation as a function of the minimum threshold of each kinematic variable. These limits are presented in Fig. 9 in terms of \u03c3A , the product of cross section, detector acceptance, and selection efficiency. Where no events are observed, the observed and expected limits reach 0.1 fb, to be compared with a limit of 1.3 fb obtained in the previous analysis [24]. Results are also provided in Table 7 for a small number of inclusive signal regions, designed based on different topologies and a small number of expected background events. The background expectation, the event count, and the expected BSM yield in any one of these regions can be used to constrain BSM hypotheses in a simple way.",

The data are found to be consistent with the standard model expectations, and no excess event yield is observed. The results are interpreted as limits at 95% confidence level on cross sections for the production of new particles in simplified supersymmetric models. Using calculations for these cross sections as functions of particle masses, the limits are turned into lower mass limits that are as high as 1500 GeV for gluinos and 830 GeV for bottom squarks, depending on the details of the model. Limits are also provided on the production of heavy scalar (excluding the mass range 350-360 GeV) and pseudoscalar (350-410 GeV) bosons decaying to top quarks in the context of two Higgs doublet models, as well as on same-sign top quark pair production, and the standard model production of four top quarks. Finally, to facilitate further interpretations of the search, model-independent limits are provided as a function of H T and E miss T , together with the background prediction and data yields in a smaller set of signal regions. accelerator departments for the excellent performance of the LHC and thank the technical and administrative staffs at CERN and at other CMS institutes for their contributions to the success of the CMS effort.
