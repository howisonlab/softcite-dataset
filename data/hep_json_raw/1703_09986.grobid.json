The data were collected with the CMS detector at the LHC and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 2.6 fb \u22121 . The distributions are found to be in agreement with predictions from perturbative quantum chromodynamics that include electroweak corrections. Limits for different contact interaction models are obtained. In a benchmark model, valid to next-to-leading order in QCD and in which only lefthanded quarks participate, quark contact interactions are excluded up to a scale of 11.5 and 14.7 TeV for destructive or constructive interference, respectively. The production of quantum black holes is excluded for masses below 7.8 or 5.3 TeV, depending on the model. The lower limits for the scales of virtual graviton exchange in the Arkani-Hamed-Dimopoulos-Dvali model of extra spatial dimensions are in the range 7.9-11.2 TeV, and are the most stringent set of limits available.",

The dijet angular distribution is typically expressed in terms of \u03c7 dijet = exp[|(y 1 \u2212 y 2 )|], where y 1 and y 2 are the rapidities of the two jets with highest p T (the leading jets). The choice of this variable is motivated by the fact that the \u03c7 dijet distribution is uniform in Rutherford scattering, and permits signatures from NP that have more-isotropic scattering-angle distributions than QCD processes to be more easily identified and examined as they could produce an excess of events at low values of \u03c7 dijet .",

            "text": "A common signature of quark compositeness models is the appearance of new interactions between quark constituents at a characteristic scale, \u039b, that is much larger than the quark masses. At energies well below \u039b, these interactions are approximated through contact interactions (CI) characterized by four-fermion couplings. The most stringent limits on quark CI come from searches studying dijet angular distributions at high dijet invariant masses (M jj ) [10][11][12], and inclusive jet p T distributions [13]. A previous search performed JHEP07 (2017)013by the CMS Collaboration at the CERN LHC at \u221a s = 8 TeV using dijet angular distributions [11] provided lower limits on \u039b ranging from 8.8 to 15.2 TeV, for a variety of CI models. The ATLAS Collaboration recently presented a similar analysis at \u221a s = 13 TeV in ref. [14], which obtained lower limits on quark CI scales in the range 13. 1-29.5 TeV, depending on the model. The Arkani-Hamed-Dimopoulos-Dvali (ADD) model [4,5] of compactified large extra dimensions (ED) provides a possible solution to the SM hierarchy problem. In protonproton collisions at the LHC, the ADD model predicts signatures of virtual graviton exchange that result in a nonresonant enhancement of dijet production and an angular distribution that differs from the QCD expectation. Signatures from virtual graviton exchange have previously been sought at the LHC in dilepton [15][16][17][18], diphoton [19][20][21], and dijet [11,22] final states, and the most stringent limits on the cutoff scale come from the dijet angular analysis of CMS at \u221a s = 8 TeV [11] that range from 5.9 to 8.4 TeV, depending on the model of virtual graviton exchange.",

Semiclassical black holes that have masses much larger than the Planck scale and decay into multijets through Hawking radiation [28], have previously been sought in multijet final states [29][30][31][32][33]. Quantum black holes (QBH), produced with mass close to the reduced Planck scale, decay predominantly into dijets that can be studied using dijet angular distributions [6][7][8]. Recent searches for QBH in dijet final states at the LHC are reported in refs. [10,12,30,31,[34][35][36]. Lower bounds on QBH masses published by the CMS Collaboration at \u221a s = 8 TeV range from 5.0 to 6.3 TeV for different QBH models [35]. Measurements of dijet angular distributions at the SppS by the UA1 Collaboration [37], at the Fermilab Tevatron by the D0 [38,39] and CDF [40] Collaborations, and at the LHC by the ATLAS [12,14,36,[41][42][43] and CMS [11,[44][45][46] Collaborations have previously been reported. In this paper, the earlier searches by CMS [11,45,46] at \u221a s = 7 and 8 TeV are extended to higher M jj using data that correspond to an integrated luminosity of 2.6 fb \u22121 at \u221a s = 13 TeV, following the same analysis strategy reported by the previous publications. The measurement of the dijet angular distributions, unfolded for detector effects, is presented and is then analyzed for the presence of contact interactions, large extra dimensions, and quantum black holes.",

The pixel and tracker cover a pseudorapidity region of |\u03b7| < 2.5 while the calorimeters cover |\u03b7| < 3.0. In addition, CMS has extensive forward calorimetry, which extends the coverage to |\u03b7| < 5.0. Finally, muons are measured in gas-ionization detectors embedded in the steel flux-return yoke of the solenoid, with a coverage of |\u03b7| < 2.4. A more detailed description JHEP07 (2017)013of the CMS detector, together with a definition of the coordinate system used and the relevant kinematic variables, can be found in ref. [47].",

The jet energies are corrected for the combined response function of the calorimeters using corrections derived from data and Monte Carlo (MC) simulations [52]. To compare data with next-to-leading order (NLO) and pythia 8.212 [53,54] predictions, particle-level jets are reconstructed by applying the same jet clustering algorithm to the four-vectors of generated stable particles (lifetime c\u03c4 > 1 cm) in the case of pythia8, and to the outgoing partons in the case of NLO predictions.",

The phase space for this analysis is defined by selecting events with 1 \u2264 \u03c7 dijet < 16 and |y boost | < 1.11, where y boost = (1/2)(y 1 + y 2 ). This selection restricts the rapidities |y 1 | and |y 2 | of the two highest-p T jets to be less than 2.5 and their p T to be larger than 200 GeV. The trigger efficiency exceeds 99% over the entire phase space. The highest value of M jj observed in the data is 6.8 TeV.",

Such fluctuations can produce bin-to-bin migrations in both \u03c7 dijet and M jj . The measured distributions are corrected for these migrations and unfolded to the particle level using the D'Agostini iteration method [58] implemented in the RooUnfold package [59]. The unfolding corrections are determined using a two-JHEP07(2017)013 dimensional response matrix mapping the generator-level M jj and \u03c7 dijet distributions onto the measured values. This matrix is obtained using particle-level jets from the pythia8 MC event generator that are smeared in p T using a double-sided Crystal-Ball parameterization [60] of the response. This parameterization takes into account the full jet energy resolution including non-Gaussian tails. The unfolding corrections change the shape of the dijet angular distributions by less than 1% across \u03c7 dijet in the lowest M jj range, and by less than 5% across \u03c7 dijet in the highest M jj range.",

The factorization (\u00b5 f ) and renormalization (\u00b5 r ) scales are set to the average p T of the two jets, p T , and the PDFs are taken from the CT14 set [67]. The use of a more flexible statistical combination of multiple PDF sets as in PDF4LHC15 100 [67][68][69][70][71][72] exhibited only small differences as compared to the use of the CT14 PDF set alone, and had negligible impact on the CI limits described in the next section. We evaluated the impact on the QCD predictions of nonperturbative effects related to hadronization and multiple parton interactions using pythia 8 with the CUETP8M1 tune [73,74] and herwig++ 2.7.1 [75] with tune EE5C.

For calculating the CI terms, as well as the interference between the CI terms and QCD terms at leading order (LO) and NLO in QCD, the cijet 1.0 program [79] is employed. For the ADD model, two parameterizations for virtual graviton exchange are considered, Giudice-Rattazzi-Wells (GRW) [80] and Han-Lykken-Zhang (HLZ) [81]. In the GRW convention, the sum over the Kaluza-Klein graviton excitations in the effective field theory is regulated by a single cutoff parameter \u039b T . In the HLZ convention, the effective theory is described in terms of two parameters, the cutoff scale M S and the number of extra spatial dimensions n ED . The parameters M S and n ED are directly related to \u039b T [82]. We consider models with 2-6 EDs. The case of n ED = 1 is not considered since it would JHEP07 (2017)013require an ED of the size of the order of the solar system; the gravitational potential at these distances would be noticeably modified and this case is therefore excluded by observation.
