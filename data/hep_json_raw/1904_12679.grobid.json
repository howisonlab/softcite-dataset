            "text": "Over the past decades, there have been several important developments at the theoretical and experimental frontiers to address the question of neutrino mass generation, which is not explained in the Standard Model (SM) of particle interactions. A widely adopted approach to explain small neutrino masses is the so-called seesaw mechanism [1], where the light neutrinos acquire their Majorana masses from dimension-5 operators through electroweak symmetry breaking. The simplest seesaw mechanism can be categorised into a few different classes, such as the Type-I [2][3][4], Type-II [5][6][7] and Type-III [5,8] seesaw scenarios. Type-I and Type-II models can further be embedded into a Left-Right Symmetric Model (LRSM) [9][10][11]. The LRSM contains SM-singlet heavy neutrinos N R , which are introduced as the parity gauge partners of the corresponding left-handed neutrino fields, and a right-handed gauge boson W R .",

Both the Type-I and Type-II contributions can coexist. In the LRSM, E-mail address: atlas .publications @cern .ch. left-handed neutrinos (SM neutrinos) as well as the right-handed neutrinos are considered to be Majorana particles (i.e. to be their own antiparticles). The LRSM thus features violation of the global lepton number symmetry of the SM.

The first level is implemented in custom electronics and reduces the event rate from the bunch-crossing frequency of 40 MHz to a design value of 100 kHz. The second level is implemented in software, running on a general-purpose processor farm which processes the events and reduces the rate of recorded events to about 1 kHz.  [27], with Pythia 8.186 [28] using the NNPDF23LO [29] parton distribution function (PDF) set and the A14 set of tuned parameters (tune) [30] for parton showering and hadronisation. A version of a LRSM model produced with Feyn-Rules [31] was implemented [32] in MG5_aMC@NLO and further modified by the authors of Refs. [33,34]. This model assumes the equivalence of left and right-handed weak gauge couplings, universality of all the right-handed quarks and right-handed leptons, and the same masses for all three flavours of heavy right-handed neutrinos. Events were generated without constraints on the charge of leptons, in line with the production of Majorana neutrinos. Signal samples were generated for different m W R and m N R hypotheses, covering the range of 3-6 TeV for m W R and 150-600 GeV for m N R . The production cross-sections are scaled to next-to-leading order (NLO) in QCD following Ref. [35].",

The signal modelling is found to be consistent between the full and the fast simulation, after application of dedicated calibration procedures. To simulate the effects of additional collisions in the same and neighbouring bunch crossings (pile-up), additional minimum-bias events generated using Pythia8 with the A3 tune [53] and MSTW2008 [54] PDF set were overlaid onto the signal and background simulated events, with a distribution of the number of collisions matching that of the data.

The analysis does not use the kinematic properties of the identified electron inside the large-R jets to reconstruct the N R or W R invariant masses, but uses the mass of the large-R jet, which includes the associated electron clusters.

The generator-level jet is obtained by clustering stable final-state particles (with lifetime greater than 30 ps) except muons and neutrinos using the same jet algorithm, radius parameter and trimming used at the detector-level. The JMS and JES of the selected large-R jets for a few representative signal samples are shown in Fig. 4 as a function of the ratio of the energy of the electron to the energy of the large-R jet. This ratio can be considered a proxy for the electromagnetic energy fraction in the large-R jet. Constant values of JES and JMS within a few percent of unity indicate that the large-R jet has only a weak dependence on the fraction of electromagnetic energy inside the jet, and thus no particular additional corrections are required for the signal large-R jets. Typical numbers for the large-R jet mass resolution (JMR) in signal events are about 4-6% in the electron channel and about 7-14% in the muon channel, while the large-R jet energy resolution (JER) is about 3-5% GeV in both channels. As opposed to the muon channel, in the electron channel the large-R jet does contain the electron as a compact and high energy deposit.

The dashed black lines depict the uncertainty on the background fit. The solid black lines on the data points indicate the Poisson uncertainties. The significance, which indicates the deviation of data in each bin from the background fit, is computed as the difference between the observed data and fit values, divided by the square root of the observed data value.",
