The particles are assumed to be pair-produced by the decay of a standard model-like Higgs boson. The experimental signature of the long-lived particle is a displaced vertex with two associated jets. No excess above the background is observed and limits are set on the production cross-section as a function of the long-lived particle mass and lifetime.",

            "text": "A variety of models for physics beyond the standard model (SM) feature the existence of new massive particles whose coupling to lighter particles is sufficiently small that they are long-lived. If these massive particles decay to SM particles and have a lifetime between approximately 1 ps and 1 ns, characteristic of weak decays, they can be identified by their displaced decay vertex. Examples of such particles are the lightest supersymmetric particle in SUSY models with baryon or lepton number violation [1][2][3][4], the next-to-lightest supersymmetric particle in gravity mediated SUSY [5] and the neutral \u03c0 v particle in hidden valley (HV) models with a non-abelian gauge symmetry [6][7][8]. The latter model is particularly interesting as it predicts that experimental studies have sensitivity to the production of long-lived particles in SM Higgs decays.",

The vertex is required to be displaced from the proton-proton collision axis by more than 0.4 mm and less than 4.8 mm. The lower bound is chosen to reject most of the background from heavy flavour decays. The upper bound ensures that vertices are inside the LHCb beam pipe, which generates a sizeable background of hadronic interaction vertices. The signal is extracted from a fit to the di-jet invariant mass distribution. The analysis is sensitive to a \u03c0 v particle with a mass between 25 and 50 GeV/c 2 and a lifetime between 1 and 200 ps. The lower boundary on the mass range arises from the requirement to identify two hadronic jets while the upper boundary is mostly due to the geometric acceptance of the LHCb detector.",

The detector includes a high-precision tracking system consisting of a silicon-strip vertex detector surrounding the pp interaction region [16], a large-area silicon-strip detector located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4 Tm, and three stations of silicon-strip detectors and straw drift tubes [17] placed downstream of the magnet. The tracking system provides a measurement of momentum, p, with a relative uncertainty that varies from 0.4 % at low momentum to 0.6 % at 100 GeV/c. The minimum distance of a track to a primary vertex, the impact parameter, is measured with a resolution of (15 + 29/ p T ) \u00b5m, where p T is the component of p transverse to the beam, in GeV/c. Different types of charged hadrons are distinguished using information from two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors [18]. Photon, electron and hadron candidates are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter and a hadronic calorimeter. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers [19].",

The first of these relies on the generic reconstruction of a displaced vertex, using an algorithm similar to that used for the primary vertex (PV) reconstruction [29]. Secondary vertices are distinguished from PVs using the distance to the interaction region in the transverse plane (R xy ). To eliminate contributions from interactions with material, a so-called 'material veto' removes vertices in a region defined as an envelope around the detector material [30]. Events are selected when they have a displaced vertex with at least four tracks, a sum of the scalar p T of all tracks that is larger than 3 GeV/c, a distance R xy larger than 0.4 mm and an invariant mass of the particles associated with this vertex m vtx above 4.5 GeV/c 2 . To further refine the selection, vertices are required to have either R xy > 2 mm or m vtx > 10 GeV/c 2 .",

It is not possible to generate sufficiently large samples of bb events to use these for a quantitative estimate of the background after the final selection. Therefore, the signal yield is extracted by a fit to the invariant mass distribution assuming a smooth shape for the background, as discussed in Sect. 6. Since the background yield, the shape of the background invariant mass distribution and the selection efficiency strongly depend on the radial displacement R xy , limits are extracted from a simultaneous maximum likelihood fit to the di-jet invariant mass distribution in five bins of R xy . The intervals are chosen in the most sensitive region, between 0.4 and 4.8 mm. The events at larger radii are not used as they contribute only marginally to the sensitivity. Figure 2 shows the distribution of R xy of selected displaced vertices for data and simulated signal events, together with the bin boundaries. The effect of the reduction in efficiency at large radii due to the material veto and the HLT1 trigger is visible, as is the effect of requirements on R xy in the trigger. The trigger effects are more pronounced in data than in simulated signal, because signal events are less affected by cuts on the vertex invariant mass.",

The signal is modelled by a bifurcated Gaussian function, whose parameters are determined from simulated events in bins of R xy . The effect of the uncertainty on the jet-energy scale is included by a scale parameter for the mass, which is common to all bins and constrained using a sample of Z + jet events, as explained in Sect. 5. Additional nuisance parameters are added to account for the finite statistics of the simulated samples and the systematic uncertainties on the signal efficiency and the luminosity. The fit model is implemented using the RooFit [34] package.

The uncertainty for displaced tracks was evaluated in the context of a recent LHCb measurement of b-hadron lifetimes [37] and extrapolated to larger R xy , leading to a per-track uncertainty of 2 %. Due to requirements on the minimal number of tracks in the vertex, this translates into an uncertainty on the vertex finding efficiency, which is estimated to be 2 % for signal events. Adding in quadrature the track efficiency and the vertex finding algorithm efficiency uncertainties leads to a total uncertainty of 7.9 % on the vertex reconstruction. The selection on the vertex sump T and mass is affected by the track finding efficiency as well.
