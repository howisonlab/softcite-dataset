While \u03b8 12 and \u03b8 23 are known to be large [1,4,6], \u03b8 13 appears to be relatively small [9][10][11][12][13], with the tightest limits so far coming from the CHOOZ [10] and MINOS [12] experiments. The T2K collaboration has recently reported indications of a nonzero value for \u03b8 13 at the 2.5\u03c3 confidence level (C.L.) [14].

This allows the construction of a system of linear equations that can be solved for the relative contributions of NC, \u03bd \u00b5 CC, and intrinsic \u03bd e CC backgrounds in the primary low-energy beam configuration [12].

For \u03bd e CC events, we further apply an energy-and LEM-dependent correction to the FD predictions that is derived from hybrid events composed of electrons from simulation and hadronic showers from data. The hadronic showers are obtained by removing the muon hits from cleanly identified \u03bd \u00b5 CC events [12,24,25], and the electromagnetic shower simulation is verified using a pure sample of electrons recorded by the MINOS Calibration Detector [26]. The breakdown of expected FD events is given in Ta , and \u03b4 = 0. The first \u03bde line refers to the intrinsic \u03bde component in the beam.
