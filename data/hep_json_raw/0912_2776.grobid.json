These arise from spin-orbit, tensor, and spin-spin interactions between the constituents. Of these three, the most interesting is the hyperfine structure that arises due to the magnetic interactions between the spins, which causes the splitting between spin-singlet (s 1 + s 2 = s = 0) and spin-triplet (s 1 + s 2 = s = 1) states. It is the transition between the 3 S 1 and 1 S 0 states of the hydrogen atom which gives rise to the famous 21 cm line which is the workhorse of microwave astronomy.",

The contribution of the confinement potential to spindependence does not follow easily. If it is assumed to be Lorentz scalar as is normally done, it can not contribute to the hyperfine interaction. However, it may very well have a different Lorentz character. Only experiments can decide. Further, the presence of a confinement interaction poses the additional question of how the hyperfine interaction changes with the radius of the potential at which the specific states reside. This is illustrated in Fig. 1 by vertical lines marking the approximate radii corresponding to the |cc and bb bound states. Clearly, the importance of the confining potential changes. The interesting questions therefore are how the consequent hyperfine splitting, changes with the 1. principle quantum number, i.e., between 1S and 2S states 2. angular momentum, i.e. from L = 0 (S-states) to L 0 (e.g., P-states) EPJ Web of Conferences Table 1.

BaBar's success owed to their very large data set and a clever way of reducing the continuum background, a cut on the socalled thrust angle, the angle between the signal photon and the thrust vector of the rest of the event. BaBar's results were:  Any important discovery requires independent confirmation. At CLEO we had data for only 5.9 million \u03a5(3S ), i.e., about 20 times less than BaBar. But we have better photon energy resolution, and we have been able to improve on BaBar's analysis technique. We make three improvements. We make very detailed analysis of the large continuum background under the very weak resonance photon peaks. We determine photon peak shapes by analyzing background from peaks in background-free radiative Bhabhas and in exclusive \u03c7 b1 decays. And we make a joint fit of the full data in three bins of | cos \u03b8 T |, covering the full range | cos \u03b8 T | = 0 \u2212 1.0. So, despite our poorer statistics, we have succeeded in confirming BaBar's discovery. The results have since then been submitted for publication [18]. The results agree with those of BaBar.",
