The linear and quadratic slopes for the decay formfactor f + (t) are measured: \u03bb \u2032 + = (26.1\u00b10.35\u00b10.28)\u00d710 \u22123 , \u03bb \u2032\u2032 + = (1.91\u00b10.19\u00b10.14)\u00d710 \u22123 . The scalar and tensor contributions are compatible with zero. Several alternative parametrizations are tried: the Pole fit parameter is found to be M V = 891 \u00b1 2.0 MeV ; the parameter of the Dispersive parametrization is measured to be \u039b + = (24.58 \u00b1 0.18) \u00d7 10 \u22123 . The presented results are considered as preliminary.",

The decay vertex is searched for, and a cut is introduced on the matching of incoming and decay track. The next step is to look for showers in GAMS-2000 and EGS calorimeters. The electron identification is done using the ratio of the energy of the shower to the momentum of the associated track. The E/p distribution is shown in Fig. 2. The particles with 0.8 < E/p < 1.2 are accepted as electrons. The events with one charged track identified as electron and two additional showers in ECAL are selected for further processing. The mass spectrum of \u03b3\u03b3 shows a clean \u03c0 0 peak at M \u03c00 = 134.9 MeV with a resolution of \u223c 8.5 MeV. To fight the main background from K \u03c02 decay, the angle between the momentum of the beam kaon p K and that of the e\u03c0-system i.e. p e + p \u03c0 is considered, see Fig. 2. The background is clearly seen as a peak at zero angles. The cut is \u03b1 > 1.6 mrad. Further selection is done by the requirement that the event passes 2C K \u2192 e\u03bd\u03c0 0 fit. The event selection results in \u223c5.25M events. The surviving background is estimated from MC to be less than 1%. ",

The main contribution to systematic is coming from the variation of the cut on Z coordinate of the vertex and the cut on the angle \u03b1. The contributions to the systematic errors from Z and \u03b1 variations are (0.021, 0.014) \u2022 10 \u22122 and (0.11, 0.06) \u2022 10 \u22123 for \u03bb \u2032 + and \u03bb \u2032\u2032 + respectively.

An interpretation of limits on F S and F T is possible in the framework of the scalar LeptoQuark(LQ) model. Then a diagram with LQ exchange should be added to the SM diagram with W. Applying Fiertz transformation to the LQ matrix element we get: (s\u00b5)(\u03bdu) = \u2212 1 2 (su)(\u03bd\u00b5) \u2212 1 8 (s\u03c3 \u03b1\u03b2 u)(\u03bd\u03c3 \u03b1\u03b2 \u00b5). The first term is the scalar, the second one -tensor. The relation between f S , f T and the Leptoquark scale \u039b LQ can be set out ( [10]).
