The magnitude of the partonic transverse momentum, kT , is obtained by comparing to a model incorporating a Gaussian kT smearing. The sensitivity of the associated charged hadron spectra to the underlying fragmentation function is tested and the data are compared to calculations using recent global fit results. The shape of the direct photon-associated hadron spectrum as well as its charge asymmetry are found to be consistent with a sample dominated by quark-gluon Compton scattering. No significant evidence of fragmentation photon correlated production is observed within experimental uncertainties.",

            "text": "Direct photon production in p + p collisions has long been regarded as a fundamental observable [1]. At leading order (LO) in perturbative QCD photons are produced directly from the hard scattering of partons and are hence independent of non-perturbative effects from hadronization. The LO diagrams, shown in Fig. 1, arise from two parton scattering processes: quark-gluon Compton scattering and quark anti-quark annihilation. Figure 2(upper) shows the fractional contribution of leading order parton scattering processes for \u221a s = 200 GeV p + p collisions at midrapidity (|\u03b7| < 0.35) using the CTEQ6 parton distribution functions [2]. Compton scattering dominates due to the abundance of gluons relative to anti-quarks. Due to the preponderance of gluons in the initial state, direct photons have historically been used to probe the gluon distribution of the proton [3,4]. For comparison, Fig. 2(lower) shows the contributing processes to leading order dijet production using a hadron trigger, in this case a \u03c0 0 . Their relative contributions have a non-trivial p T dependence, in large part a consequence of triggering on a jet fragment 1 . In the final state, to the extent that leading order Compton scattering dominates, the direct photon is likely to oppose a quark jet. Moreover, the transverse momentum of the recoil parton is exactly nominally balanced by that of the photon, a feature often exploited to determine the energy scale in jet reconstruction [6].",

The contribution of these fragmentation photons depends on the non-perturbative parton-to-photon fragmentation functions which are poorly constrained relative to the fragmentation functions into hadrons [7,8]. NLO effects spoil the exact transverse momentum balance between the photon and the recoil jet which holds at LO. Often the contribution from fragmentation photons is suppressed by applying an isolation criterion to the photon sample [9][10][11][12][13]. Typically, the total energy from hadron production in a cone around the photon is required to be small compared to that of the photon. The cross section of isolated photons may then be compared to NLO calculations with the same isolation criterion applied.",

The distribution of hadrons in the away-side jet reflects the so-called medium modified fragmentation function which is the product of the jet fragmentation in the dense QCD environment. Deviations from vacuum jet fragmentation, as observed in p+p collisions, hence should enable tomographic studies of the medium using the energy loss of the away-side to probe the density profile of the medium. A first, albeit statistics-limited measurement, of direct photon-hadron correlations was presented in [28].

The momentum balance between the photon and the oppositeside parton is spoiled due the k T effect and by the contribution of fragmentation photons in the direct photon sample. The present work endeavors to study such effects. The remainder of the article is organized as follows. In section II we describe elements of the apparatus relevant to the measurement of photon-hadron correlations. In section III the methodology of extracting direct photon correlations from the background of decay photon-hadron correlations is detailed. Section IV presents results on \u03c0 0 and direct photon triggered correlations. Finally, section V interprets the results at the partonic level using a simple of LO pQCD calculation coupled with phenomenologically-motivated k T smearing.",

In order to measure direct photons over the range 5 < p T < 15 GeV/c, \u03c0 0 and \u03b7 must be reconstructed over a larger range of 4 < p T < 17 GeV/c to account for decay feed-down and detector resolution as described below. Direct photon, \u03c0 0 and \u03b7 cross section measurements in p + p collisions are described in [33][34][35]. Photon candidates of very high purity (> 98% for energies > 5 GeV) are selected from EMCal clusters with the use of cluster shower shape and charge particle veto cuts. At large photon p T (\u2248 10 GeV/c in the PbSc), clusters from \u03c0 0 photon pairs start to overlap. Nearly all of such merged clusters, as well as other sources of hadron contamination, have an anomalous shower shape, and thus are removed from the analysis.",

The rate of combinatorial photon pairs is reduced by only considering photons of energy > 1 GeV. As discussed in the next section, jet correlations of decay photon trigger particles with charged hadron partner particles are estimated from those of their parent mesons. The quantity of interest is the per-trigger yield, Y . For the \u03c0 0 , for example, the per-trigger yield, Y \u03c0 , is the number of \u03c0 0 -hadron pairs divided by the number of \u03c0 0 triggers. For the given photon selection, the effect of combinatorial pairs on the measured per-trigger yield was evaluated with PYTHIA to be < 2%. The smallness of the effect is due both to the small combinatorial rate itself as well as the similarity of correlations from falsely matched photons, most of which are themselves from \u03c0 0 decay, to the true \u03c0 0 correlations.",

However, the extended range of the fit allows for a better comparison with the photon triggered data, whose poorer statistical precision necessitates fits over a larger range. For the case of isolated direct photon triggers, Eq. 15 will not describe the x E distribution of the away-side jet because it is assumed that the trigger particle is also the fragment of a jet. However, for a fixed value of n, Eq. 15 is a useful quantitative representation of the steepness of the x E distribution via the parameterx h ; a smaller value ofx h corresponds to a steeper distribution. Since the parameters n andx h have physical meaning for \u03c0 0 -hadron correlations, we keep the same value of n = 8.1 for the isolated-\u03b3-hadron correlations so as to get a quantitative measure of the relative steepness of the isolated-\u03b3-hadron x E distribution compared to the \u03c0 0 -h distribution. The results of the fits, shown in Table IV, confirm a steeper distribution for photon triggers where statistical precision allows. The independence of thex h values for \u03c0 0 as a function of p T suggests that x E scaling should hold for all the data combined. This is shown in the left panel of Fig. 10 in which all \u03c0 0 p T selections are fit simultaneously. It is interesting to note that the failure of x E scaling in a similar measurement (for lower p T , 2-4 GeV/c) at the CERN-ISR [39], led to the concept of parton transverse momentum and k T .",

For pairs which fall in the PHENIX pseudorapidity (|\u03b7| < 0.35) interval the right-hand side of Equation 18 is used to weight the contribution of each particle pair. The expression consists of the angular component of the LO parton scattering cross section,\u03c3, for each parton flavor combination a+b and the non-perturbative parton distribution functions (PDF), f , and fragmentation functions (FF), D. An equal number of all possible permutations of each parton flavor are thrown, neglecting charm and heavier quarks. The angular part of the parton scattering cross section,\u03c3 a,b (cos \u03b8 * ), contains a numerical factor which weights each scattering process appropriately.\u015d is the Mandelstam variable representing the square of the center-of-mass energy at the partonic level and is related to the p + p center-of-mass energy of \u221a s = 200 GeV b\u0177 s = x 1 x 2 s. The amplitudes for dijet processes can be found in [44]. Direct photon-hadron correlations are also considered. The \u03b3 + jet amplitudes can be found in [45]. In this case, D(z 4 ) is taken to be a \u03b4 function at z 4 = 1 and the \u03b1 2 s coupling becomes \u03b1 s \u03b1 EM . The PDFs and FFs are taken from global fit analyses. The PDFs used in this study are the CTEQ6 set [2] evaluated using NLO evolution which were obtained from the Durham HEP database [46]. Several fits to the FFs, KKP, AKK and DSS are tested with the Monte Carlo generator [5,47,48]. These parametrizations differ in the selection of data sets used in their fits. The KKP set relies solely on e + e \u2212 data while the recent AKK and DSS fits also employ data from deeply inelastic scattering and p + p collisions. The use of these additional data sets enables the separation of the quark and anti-quark FFs and provides much better constraints on the gluon FFs, although uncertainties for the gluon FFs remain large. Despite the recent progress, the AKK and DSS differ quite substantially in a number of observables and discrepancies exist between fits and certain data sets. Newer data sets and observables are required to further constrain the FFs. Of particular interest for studies of heavy-ion collisions is the region of low z where modifications of the FF by the dense QCD medium are expected. Whereas inclusive hadron cross sections are most sensitive to relatively large values of z (typically 0.7-0.8), two-particle correlations provide access to smaller values of z using an asymmetric p T selection of the trigger and partner. Direct photons are ideally suited for this purpose due to the absence of near-side jet fragmentation effects at LO. However, higher order effect such as photon fragmentation and soft gluon emission must be constrained.",

The LO cross sections are divergent in the forward and/or backward directions and the gluon distribution becomes very large at low x. In the absence of k T smearing these effects are irrelevant for production at midrapidity. However, for a Gaussian distributed k T of fixed width there is a finite probability for a parton to be scattered at large angle, solely by virtue of receiving a large momentum kick from sampling the tail of the k T distribution. Due to the largeness of the low x gluon distribution and the cross sections at small angle these soft partons would dominate the cross section. This is clearly an unphysical consequence of the k T smearing procedure. The k T boost is intended to simulate gluon emission which should clearly be bounded by the momentum of the parton from which it radiates. This requirement is enforced by imposing the that |k T | < x \u221a s/2. The calculation was found to be insensitive to the threshold.",

The systematic error band indicates the dependence on the choice of FF parametrization. The value of |k T | 2 may depend on p trig T since the trigger requirement may preferentially select events based on their k T . For both the \u03c0 0 and photon triggered samples, the value of |k T | 2 depends on p trig T , and reaches values larger than the input, although the effect is only statistically significant for the \u03c0 0 triggered data. The values of |k T | 2 are generally larger for \u03c0 0 triggers, but within statistical uncertainties on the photon triggered sample, the size of the k T effect is of comparable magnitude. Using the value of |k T | 2 which best matches the data, the shape of the x E distribution can be calculated in the LO+k T model, for each set of FFs, and compared to the data. Figure 17 (top panel) shows the slope parameter,x h , of the power-law fits to the x E distributions for \u03c0 0 triggers shown in Fig. 9. Several calculations are shown. The KKP and DSS fits reproduce the shape of the data better than the AKK fit, which shows a much harder slope. The disparity amongst the calculations seems to contradict the claim in [16] that the x E distribution for \u03c0 0 triggers is not sensitive to the overall shape of the FF. To test this assertion using the LO+k T model, an exponential function was used for each flavor of FF. The slopes of the FFs were varied, using D(z) \u221d exp (\u22128.2z) and D(z) \u221d exp (\u221211.4z), to represent the quark and gluon FFs, respectively, as was done in [16]. Indeed one finds that the calculation is not very sensitive to the change in the slope parameter. This exercise does not, however, take into account that a change in the shape of the FF for an individual parton flavor may change not only the admixture of quark and gluon jets, but also the shape of the p T distribution of hard scattered partons, which is |kT | 2 as a function of p trig T for \u03c0 0 and isolated direct photon triggers. Also shown are \u03c0 0 \u2212 h results using a different method [16].",

Since the PDF for the gluon is much different than for the quarks, the sensitivity of the x E distribution to the parent parton composition of the \u03c0 0 triggered jets can be tested by removing gluon scattering processes from the calculation. To illustrate this, the slope resulting from using only the q + q \u2192 q + q processes with the DSS FFs is also shown in Fig. 17. A significantly harder slope is obtained, verifying that the x E distribution depends on the parton species composition of the triggered jet sample. The effect of the k T smearing on the shape of the x E distribution was also investigated. Turning off the smearing results in a harder slope for smaller p trig T , which gradually disappears as p trig T becomes much larger than k T . Figure 17 (bottom panel) shows the same comparison for isolated photon triggers. Here the calculation depends less strongly on the choice of FF parametrization due to the smaller contribution of the annihilation subprocess, q+q \u2192 \u03b3 +g, compared to the predominant g+q \u2192 \u03b3 +q. In contrast to the \u03c0 0 triggered sample, the shape of the x E distribution depends rather strongly on the shape of the overall FF as demonstrated by varying the slope parameter of the exponential parametrization. The magnitude of this effect is reproduced in a gluon jet sample, in which only the annihilation process is turned on. The distribution for the gluon jet sample is significantly steeper than the data, verifying that the sample is dominated by quark jet fragmentation. As for the \u03c0 0 triggered sample, the Monte-Carlo x E distribution becomes harder if the k T smearing is turned off. Irrespective of the fit, the data in the 5 < p trig T < 7 GeV/c bin are incompatible with a model without k T smearing, as a significant yield is observed at x E > 1. ",

Since there are twice as many up quarks as down and the amplitude depends on the electric charge of the quark, one expects an asymmetry of 8 : 1 in the number of up quark to down quark recoil jets from the Compton scattering of a valence quark and a gluon. One expects a dilution of this factor for several reasons, for example creation of charge pairs in the course of the parton shower process, corrections from higher order processes such as photon fragmentation and a contribution from sea quarks. Nevertheless, a residual charge asymmetry should be apparent in the final state hadrons. Figure 18 shows the ratio of positively to negatively charged hadrons (R\u00b1) on the away-side of both \u03c0 0 and isolated direct photon triggers as a function of p assoc T along with calculations using the DSS FFs in the LO+k T model with the best value of k T as determined in Section V B. The \u03c0 0 triggered data show an R\u00b1 close to unity. On the other hand, an excess of positive charge is evident in the isolated direct photon triggered yields. This supports the claim that the recoil jet is dominated by quark fragmentation. ",

            "text": "A detailed understanding of jet fragmentation in p + p collisions is a prerequisite for studies of possible medium modifications to the fragmentation functions by the QCD medium at RHIC. To this end, this study provides baseline measurements of two particle correlations from which to quantify these effects. Direct photon triggered correlations were obtained by a combination of event-byevent identification, in the form of decay photon tagging and isolation cuts, and a subtraction of the residual decay photon associated component. The measurement of near-side hadron production associated with inclusive direct photon (i.e., without isolation cuts) triggers shows no evidence for a large contribution from dijet processes, as might be expected from a large fragmentation photon component. The yield opposite isolated direct photons was found to be smaller than for \u03c0 0 , consistent with the expectation of a smaller away-side jet momentum for fixed p trig T . Furthermore, the isolated direct photon associated yields were steeper than for \u03c0 0 and demonstrated x E scaling as one would expect if the distributions closely resemble the underlying charged hadron fragmentation function. As a function of p out , the away-side yields for \u03c0 0 triggers show a Gaussian-like behavior at small values of p out , whereas a harder, power-law like component emerges at large p out . The tail component is interpreted to be due the emission of a hard gluon. The isolated direct photon triggered distributions also appear to show evidence for a hard tail; however the data are consistent with zero yield when p out \u2265 p trig T , corresponding to the kinematic limit for LO photon production.",

            "text": "The results were further interpreted at the parton level using a simple model of LO pQCD incorporating a phenomenologically-motivated Gaussian k T smearing. The hadron yields opposite isolated direct photons are shown to be directly sensitive to the fragmentation function of the away-side parton. In contrast, hadron triggered jets are sensitive only indirectly, due to the contribution of multiple sub-processes in the initial state, the relative contribution of which is sensitive to the gluon FFs. Furthermore, the shape of the distributions are shown to be compatible with the Compton scattering process q + g \u2192 q + \u03b3. The dominance of the Compton scattering process is further reinforced by the positive charge asymmetry observed opposite isolated direct photon triggers. Finally, the direct photon data are shown to be compatible with a |k T | 2 of similar magnitude to that required by the \u03c0 0 triggered data, within uncertainties. Such a large momentum imbalance between the photon and the recoil jet is significant for studies of photon tagged jets in nuclear collisions in the kinematic regime currently accessible at RHIC.",
