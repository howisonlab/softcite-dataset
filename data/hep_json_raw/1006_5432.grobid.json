            "text": "One mechanism responsible for baryon-number transport is the breakup of the proton into a diquark-quark configuration [2]. The diquark hadronizes after the reaction with some longitudinal momentum p z into a new particle, which carries the baryon number of the incoming proton. This baryon-number transport is usually quantified in terms of the rapidity loss \u00c1y \u00bc y beam \u00c0 y baryon , where y beam (y baryon ) is the rapidity of the incoming beam (outgoing baryon). [The rapidity y is defined as y \u00bc 0:5 ln\u00bd\u00f0E \u00fe p z \u00de=\u00f0E \u00c0 p z \u00de; rapidity y \u00bc 0 corresponds to longitudinal momentum p z \u00bc 0 of the baryon in the center-of-mass system and \u00c1y \u00bc ln\u00f0 ffiffi ffi s p =m p \u00de.] However, diquarks in general retain a large fraction of the proton momentum and therefore stay close to beam rapidity, typically within one or two units. Therefore, additional processes have been proposed to transport the baryon number over larger distances in rapidity, in particular, via purely gluonic exchanges, where the proton breaks up into three quarks. The baryon number resides with a nonperturbative configuration of gluon fields, the so-called ''baryon string junction,'' which connects the valence quarks [1,3]. In this picture, baryon-number transport is suppressed exponentially with the rapidity interval \u00c1y, proportional to exp\u00bd\u00f0 J \u00c0 1\u00de\u00c1y, where J is identified in the Regge model as the intercept of the trajectory for the corresponding exchange in the t channel. If the stringjunction intercept is approximated with the one of the standard Reggeon (or meson), J % 0:5, baryon transport will approach zero with increasing \u00c1y. If the intercept of the pure string junction is J % 1, as motivated by perturbative QCD [4], it will approach a constant and finite value.",

Concerning elastic scattering, where only a limited data set is available for comparison, GEANT3 cross sections are about 25% above FLUKA, the latter being again closer to the measurements.

For both energies, two of the PYTHIA tunes [20] (ATLAS-CSC and Perugia-0) as well as the version of quark-gluon string model (QGSM) with the value of the string-junction intercept J \u00bc 0:5 [6] describe the experimental values well, whereas QGSM without string junctions ( \u00bc 0, is a parameter proportional to the probability of the stringjunction exchange) is slightly above the data. HIJING/B [7], unlike the above models, includes a particular implementation of gluonic string junctions to enhance baryonnumber transfer. This model underestimates the experimental results, in particular, at the lower LHC energy. Also, QGSM with a value of the junction intercept J \u00bc 0:9 [6] predicts a smaller ratio, as does the Perugia-SOFT tune of PYTHIA, which also includes enhanced baryon transfer. [We have checked that baryon transfer is the main reason for the different \" p=p ratios predicted by the models; the absolute yield of (anti-) protons in our acceptance, which is dominated by pair production, is reproduced by the models to within AE20%.] Figure 4 shows a compilation of central rapidity measurements of the ratio R in pp collisions as a function of center-of-mass energy (upper axis) and the rapidity interval \u00c1y (lower axis).

            "text": "A rough approximation of the \u00c1y dependence of the ratio R can be derived in the Regge model, where baryon pair production at very high energy is governed by Pomeron exchange and baryon transport by string-junction exchange [5]. In this case the p= \" p ratio takes the simple form 1=R \u00bc 1 \u00fe C exp\u00bd\u00f0 J \u00c0 P \u00de\u00c1y. We have fitted such a function to the data, using as value for the Pomeron intercept P \u00bc 1:2 [24] and J \u00bc 0:5, whereas C, which determines the relative contributions of the two diagrams, is adjusted to the measurements from ISR, Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC), and LHC. The fit, shown in Fig. 4, gives a reasonable description of the data with only one free parameter (C), except at lower energies, where contributions of other diagrams cannot be neglected [5]. Adding a second string-junction diagram with a larger intercept [4], i.e., 1=R \u00bc 1 \u00fe C exp\u00bd\u00f0 J \u00c0 P \u00de\u00c1y \u00fe C 0 exp\u00bd\u00f0 J 0 \u00c0 P \u00de\u00c1y with J 0 \u00bc 1, does not improve the quality of the fit and its contribution is compatible with zero (C % 10, C 0 % \u00c00:1 AE 0:1). In a similar spirit, our data could also be used to constrain other Reggemodel inspired descriptions of baryon asymmetry, for example, when the string-junction exchange is replaced by the ''odderon,'' which is the analogue of the Pomeron with odd C parity; see [6].",
