            "text": "the KEKB asymmetric-energy e + e \u2212 collider. From these moments we determine the CP -violationsensitive asymmetry a T -odd CP = \u22120.28 \u00b1 1.38 (stat.) +0. 23 \u22120.76 (syst.) \u00d7 10 \u22123 , which is consistent with no CP violation. In addition, we perform a T -odd CP measurements in different regions of the D 0 \u2192 K 0 S \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 phase space; these are also consistent with no CP violation. Standard Model (SM) CP violation, which is due to the Kobayashi-Maskawa mechanism [1], is very small [O(10 \u22123 )] in interactions involving decays of charm hadrons. Hence, any enhancement with respect to the SM prediction can indicate new physics effects due to particles or interactions not included in the SM [2]. The decay D 0 \u2192 K 0 S \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 has a self-conjugate final state that can be used for a precise test of CP symmetry. Due to its large branching fraction of 5.2% [3], one can isolate a sample of O (10 6 ) decays that allows a test at a precision of O(10 \u22123 ). This decay has been studied once before [4] but with a sample of only 140 events. Here, we report the first measurement of the time-reversal (T ) asymmetry in D 0 \u2192 K 0 S \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 decays, which is sensitive to CP violation via the CP T theorem [5]. This is the first T asymmetry measurement for a D meson decay with two neutral particles in the final state, one of which is a \u03c0 0 meson.",

The decay vertex of the K 0 S candidates is required to be displaced from the e + e \u2212 interaction point by a transverse distance of greater than 0.22 cm for momenta greater than 1.5 GeV/c, and greater than 0.08 cm for momenta between 0.5 and 1.5 GeV/c [23].

These criteria suppress the beam-related backgrounds, which are typically asymmetric in polar angle.

We form D * + from the selected D 0 and \u03c0 + slow candidates. To eliminate D * mesons from B decays, which have different kinematic and topological properties, we require the D * + momentum in the center-of-mass frame to be greater than 2.5 GeV/c. A small contamination of 0.015% and 0.096% from B and B s events, respectively, is found from MC simulation studies. We define the variable \u2206M = M D * + \u2212 M D 0 , where M D * + is the mass of the D * + candidate; this peaks at 145 MeV/c 2 [3] for correctly reconstructed D * + mesons. We require \u2206M to be less than 150 MeV/c 2 to suppress the combinatorial background. We perform kinematically-constrained vertex fits for both the D 0 vertex (using the \u03c0 + and \u03c0 \u2212 tracks, \u03c0 0 vertex, and K 0 S momentum) and the D * + vertex (using the D 0 momentum and \u03c0 + slow track). We remove very poorly reconstructed candidates whose vertex fit quality parameter exceeds 1000. We also apply a kinematically-constrained mass fit for the D 0 meson candidates to improve the resolution of the momenta of D 0 daughters. Selection criteria are chosen to maximize the significance S/ \u221a S + B, where S (B) is the number of MC signal (background) events in the signal region, defined as 144-147 MeV/c 2 for \u2206M and 1.82-1.90 GeV/c 2 for M D 0 .

The latter consists of a correctly reconstructed D 0 \u2192 K 0 S \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 decay paired with a \u03c0 + slow candidate that is not from a common D * + parent. The background contributions in the selected data sample are 55% and 1% for combinatorial and random \u03c0 + slow components, respectively. The signal purity is 79% in the signal region.

The combinatorial background component is parametrized with a first-order polynomial. The random \u03c0 + slow component is modeled by the signal PDF.The \u2206M signal component is described by a PDF formed from the sum of a CB function, two Gaussians, and an asymmetric Gaussian function. The combinatorial component is parametrized by a PDF that is the sum of an empirical threshold function and a Gaussian function. The threshold function has the form",
