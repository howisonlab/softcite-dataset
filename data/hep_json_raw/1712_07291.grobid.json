The measurement of tripho ton production can be performed in a broader range of kinematic regions than in 2 \u2192 2 reactions such as inclusive-photon [1][2][3][4] and diphoton [5][6][7] production.

In the fragmentation process, at least one of the photons arises from the fragmentation of a high-transversemomentum (high-pT) parton (qg \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3q[\u03b3 ]). Direct photons are typically isolated, while those originating from the fragmentation process are usually accompanied by nearby partons. Measurements of final-state photons include an isolation requirement to reduce background contributions from neutral-hadron decays into pho tons.

The most rel evant systems for the present measurement are the inner detector, immersed in a 2 T magnetic field produced by a thin supercon ducting solenoid, and the calorimeters. At small radii, the inner de tector is made up of fine-granularity pixel and microstrip detectors. These silicon-based detectors cover the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 2.5. A gas-filled straw-tube transition radiation tracker comple ments the silicon tracker at larger radii in the range |\u03b7| < 2.0and also provides electron identification capabilities based on transition radiation. The electromagnetic calorimeter is a lead/liquid-argon sampling calorimeter with accordion geometry. The calorimeter is divided into a barrel section covering |\u03b7| < 1.475 and two end cap sections covering 1.375 < |\u03b7| < 3.2. For |\u03b7 | < 2.5it is divided into three layers in depth, which are finely segmented in \u03b7 and \u03c6 . A thin presampler layer, covering |\u03b7 | < 1.8, is used to correct for fluctuations in upstream energy losses. The hadronic calorime ter in the region |\u03b7| < 1.7 uses steel absorbers with scintillator tiles as the active medium. Liquid-argon with copper absorbers is used in the hadronic end-cap calorimeters, which cover the region 1.5 < |\u03b7| < 3.2. Events are selected using a first-level trigger im plemented in custom electronics, which reduces the event rate to a value of 75 kHz using a subset of detector information. Soft ware algorithms with access to the full detector information are then used in the high-level trigger to yield a recorded event rate of about 400 Hz [15].",

The renormalisation scale \u03bcR , factorisation scale \u03bcF and fragmen tation scale \u03bcf are chosen to be \u03bcR = \u03bcF = \u03bcf = m\u03b3\u03b3\u03b3. In ad dition, the MCFM calculations are performed using an isolation criterion which requires the total transverse energy from the par tons inside a cone of size ^ R = 0.4 around the photon direction to satisfy E i Tso < 10 GeV. The MCFM NLO pQCD predictions re fer to the parton level while the measurements are performed at the particle level. Since the E i Tso requirement at the particle level is applied after the subtraction of the UE transverse energy, it is expected that parton-to-hadron corrections to the NLO pQCD predictions are small. This is confirmed by computing the ratio of the particle-level cross section for a MadGraph sample inter faced with Pythia with UE effects to the computed cross section without hadronisation and UE effects. The ratio is consistent with unity over the measured range of the variables under study. There fore, no correction is applied to the MCFM NLO pQCD calculations. Deviations from unity of O (1%) on the parton-to-hadron correc tion factors are found when the hadronisation and UE effects are included using Herwig++ 7.0.1 [30]. Predictions based on other pro ton PDF sets, namely MSTW2008 [31] and NNPDF2.1 [32], are also computed. Differences of +5% and +6% in the calculation of the inclusive fiducial cross section are found using the MSTW2008 and NNPDF2.1 PDF sets, respectively, whereas the dependence of the shape of the differential cross sections on the PDF sets is found to be small.",

A tight photon-identification selec tion [36] is applied to reject hadronic jet background, by im posing requirements on nine discriminating variables (referred to as \"shower shapes\") computed from the energy leaking into the hadronic calorimeter and the lateral and longitudinal shower de velopment in the electromagnetic calorimeter. The efficiency of this selection for one photon is \u224867% (>90%) for E T \u03b3 \u2248 15 GeV (>100 GeV). For the MC simulations, the shower-shape variables are shifted to correct for small differences in the average values be tween data and the simulation. In addition, E T \u03b3and \u03b7\u03b3 -dependent factors are applied to correct for the residual mismatch between the photon identification efficiencies in the simulation and the data. The isolation of the photon E i Tso is based on the amount of transverse energy inside a cone of size ^ R = 0.4in the \u03b7-\u03c6 plane around the photon candidates, excluding an area of size ^\u03b7 \u00d7 ^\u03c6 = 0.125 \u00d7 0.175 centred on the photon energy cluster. The isolation transverse energy is computed from the topological clusters of calorimeter cells [38]. The measured E i Tso is corrected for the leakage of the photon's energy into the isolation cone and the estimated contributions from the UE and pile-up. These latter two corrections are computed simultaneously on an eventby-event basis and the combined correction is typically between 1.5 and 2.0 GeV [3]. The E i Tso value for isolated photons is required to be lower than E i Tso = 0.025 \u2022 E T \u03b3 + 2.7 [GeV]. The efficiency of the isolation requirement is typically above 80% and increases as a function of E T \u03b3 .The number of data events selected in the signal region is 1085. For background studies, two alternative categories of photons are defined. First, non-tight photon candidates are de fined as those passing the loose selection but not satisfying the tight identification criteria for at least one of the shower-shape variables computed from the energy deposits in cells of the first layer of the EM calorimeter. Second, non-isolated photon candi dates are defined to have Ei Tso > 0.025",

The two-dimensional-sideband method exploited in Refs. [2,3,5,[39][40][41] to measure the inclusive photon and diphoton differential cross sections is used to perform an in situ statisti cal subtraction of the background. The method uses the photon isolation energy and photon identification criteria to discriminate prompt photons from jets. It relies on the fact that the correla tions between the isolation and identification variables in jet back ground events are small, and that the signal contamination in the non-tight or non-isolated control region is low.",

The MCFM calculations underestimate the measurements by 50% in the low invariant mass regions, whereas the differences are 30-40% for m\u03b31\u03b32 ^ 150 GeV, m\u03b31\u03b33 ^ 75 GeV, m\u03b32\u03b33 ^ 75 GeV and m\u03b3\u03b3\u03b3 ^ 150 GeV. The MadGraph5_aMC@NLO calculations also un derestimate the data by 30-50% in the low invariant mass regions. However, they tend to give a better description of the measure ments for m\u03b31 \u03b32 ^ 150 GeV, m\u03b31 \u03b33 ^ 75 GeV, m\u03b32 \u03b33 ^ 75 GeV and m\u03b3\u03b3\u03b3 ^ 150 GeV.

This tests the description of the shape of the differential cross sections. The total systematic uncertainty is considered to be fully corre lated across bins and is included in the \u03c7 2 definition using nui sance parameters. After the \u03c7 2 minimisation, scale factors equal to \u2248 1.6 (MadGraph5_aMC@NLO) and \u2248 2.3 (MCFM) are found for each angular distribution independently.

Measured differential cross sections for the production of three isolated photons (dots) as functions of (a) m\u03b31\u03b32, (b) m\u03b31\u03b33 , (c) m\u03b32\u03b33 and (d) m\u03b3\u03b3\u03b3. The NLO QCD calculations from MCFM and MadGraph5_aMC@NLO are also shown. The thickness of each theoretical prediction corresponds to the theoretical uncertainty. The bottom part of each figure shows the ratios of predicted and measured differential cross sections. The red inner (black outer) error bars represent the systematic uncertainties (the statistical and systematic uncertainties added in quadrature). For most of the data points, the inner error bars are smaller than the marker size and thus not visible.",
