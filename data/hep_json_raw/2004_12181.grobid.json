The analysis uses proton-proton collision data from the LHC, collected during 2016 by the CMS experiment, at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 . Processes directly sensitive to these matrix elements are considered at both the production and decay vertices of the top quark. In the standard model hypothesis of CKM unitarity, a lower limit of |V tb | > 0.970 is measured at the 95% confidence level. Several theories beyond the standard model are considered, and by releasing all constraints among the involved parameters, the values |V tb | = 0.988 \u00b1 0.024, and |V td | 2 + |V ts | 2 = 0.06 \u00b1 0.06, where the uncertainties include both statistical and systematic components, are measured.",

            "text": "A distinctive feature of the electroweak sector of top quark physics is the relative magnitude of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) [1] matrix element V tb with respect to V td and V ts , which leads to a strong suppression of processes involving mixing between the third and the first two quark families. This feature can be probed at the CERN LHC by studying the couplings of top quarks to d, s, and b quarks in electroweak charged-current interactions, where such couplings play a role at either the production or decay vertices of the top quark. In general, top quarks are produced in proton-proton (pp) collisions through the strong interaction, predominantly via gluon fusion, creating a top quarkantiquark (tt ) pair. Top quarks can also be singly produced via the electroweak interaction, in which case the dominant mechanism involves an exchange of a W boson in the t channel, a process which has been precisely measured at the LHC [2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11]. The dominant decay process for a top quark is to a W boson and a b quark via an electroweak charged-current interaction. All single top quark processes therefore allow the direct probing of the tWq vertex, with q representing a b, d, or s quark, both in production and decay of the top quark. In the t channel, a top quark is produced recoiling against a light quark, henceforth referred to as q .

This model dependence motivates alternative inferences based on different sets of hypotheses. In particular, given that these three CKM elements connect the top quark with down-type quarks, it is natural to use events enriched in top quarks to set constraints on them. Two   [14][15][16][17]. The B(t \u2192 Wb) measurement is sensitive to the CKM elements of interest through the decay vertex of the top quark, and can be turned into a measurement of the value of |V tb | only under the hypothesis of the unitarity of the 3 \u00d7 3 CKM matrix. The second method is based on the single top quark production cross section and is sensitive in principle through both the production and decay of the top quark.

The four-flavour scheme [40] is used for events with the V tb vertex in production, while the five-flavour scheme [41] is used for events with one V td or V ts vertex in production. Top quark decays are simulated with madspin [42]. The tt background process [43], as well as double vector boson production [44,45] (VV, where V stands for either a W or a Z boson), are generated with powheg 2.0. Associated top quark and W boson production are simulated with powheg in the five-flavour scheme [46]. Single top quark s-channel events (t, s-ch) are simulated with MadGraph5_amc@nlo 2.2.2 [47] at NLO. The value of the top quark mass used in the simulated samples is 172.5 GeV. For all samples pythia 8.180 [48] with tune CUETP8M1 [49] is used to simulate the parton shower, quark hadronisation, and underlying event, except for tt , where the tune CUETPM2T4 is used [50]. Simulated event samples with W and Z bosons in association with jets (W+jets, Z+jets) are generated using MadGraph5_amc@nlo 2.2.2. For these processes, events with up to two additional partons emitted in the hard scattering are simulated, and the FxFx merging scheme [51] is used to avoid double counting with parton emissions generated in the parton showering. Simulated QCD multijet events, generated at LO with pythia 8.180, are used to validate the estimation of this background with a technique based on control samples in data.",

Events with exactly one muon or electron and at least two jets are considered in this analysis, as was done in the latest CMS single top quark cross section measurement [10]. The neutrino accompanying the lepton cannot be directly detected, and manifests itself in the detector as a measured momentum imbalance in the event. Depending on the CKM matrix element involved in the decay, the final state may include a jet from the hadronisation of either a b, s, or d quark. A jet recoiling against the top quark is present, and it is produced usually at low angle with respect to the beam axis. A third jet can stem from the second quark produced in the gluon splitting (as shown in Fig. 1(c)). The quark from gluon splitting generates a jet that usually has a softer transverse momentum (p T ) spectrum than that of the jet from the top quark decay products. Depending on the number of tWb vertices in the event process, one can have one jet coming from the hadronisation of a b quark (b jet) if the tWb vertex occurs in production or in decay but not in both, or two b jets if the tWb vertex occurs both in production and decay.",

The physics objects are the jets, clustered using the jet-finding algorithm [54,55] with the tracks assigned to candidate vertices as inputs, and the associated missing p T (p miss T ), taken as the magnitude of the negative vector sum of the p miss T of those jets. The particle-flow (PF) algorithm [56] is used to reconstruct and identify individual particles in the event using combined information from the subdetectors of the CMS experiment, allowing identification of muons, electrons, photons, and charged and neutral hadrons. After triggering, muons are considered for further analysis if they have p T > 26 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.4, while electrons are required to have p T > 35 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.1. Additional isolation requirements are used to discriminate between prompt leptons and those coming from hadronic decays within jets, by defining I rel , as the scalar sum of the p T of charged hadrons, neutral hadrons, and photons divided by the p T of lepton in a cone of R = ( \u03b7) 2 + ( \u03c6) 2 = 0.4 around the muon and 0.3 around the electron, where \u03c6 is the azimuthal angle in radians.

First, for S T b,q events, only a single b quark is present in the final state stemming from gluon splitting, thus resulting in a low-energy b-tagged jet, while the jet coming from the top quark decay is usually not b tagged. For S T q,b events, a single b-tagged jet is produced in the top quark decay, and additional jets from gluon splitting are usually not b tagged. Both S T q,b and S T b,q processes therefore differ from S T b,b by having a single b quark in the final state, as opposed to two for the latter process. However, this feature can only be exploited when the jet from gluon splitting is energetic enough to be reconstructed. Second, further discrimination is achieved by exploiting the features of the reconstructed top quark candidates. The kinematic and angular properties of the decay products exhibit significant differences depending on whether the correct jet is chosen, or if the jet that originated from the quark produced in the gluon splitting is used. For S T b,q events, the top quark reconstructed with the correct jet assignment usually does not use the b-tagged jet in the event, while for S T b,b and S T q,b , the top quark candidate is reconstructed by using the b-tagged jet in the majority of cases. It is therefore possible to differentiate between the S T b,b and S T b,q processes by comparing the features of top quark candidates reconstructed with or without b-tagged jets. Finally, different PDFs are involved in S T b,b and S T q,b processes, the latter drawing contributions from valence d quarks as well. Therefore, the kinematic properties of final-state particles may differ from the other channels. The second characteristic, related to the correctness of the top quark reconstruction hypothesis, proves to be the strongest amongst the three mentioned criteria. While the S T b,q and the S T b,b processes can be differentiated by using this characteristic, the S T q,b and the S T b,b productions cannot, because their final-state signatures exhibit the same features.",

These latter uncertainties include the sources related to the modelling of the signal process, which cannot be constrained from the measurement since they apply to the full phase space and not only to the region in which the measurement is performed. Also included are the jet energy scale and resolution uncertainties, which play a major role in events featuring hadronic activity in the high-pseudorapidity region of the detector. They are also intertwined with the uncertainties in the modelling of the hadronisation and cause a larger uncertainty in the signal acceptance, which was not the case for previous measurements [10,11].

Some BSM scenarios predict the presence of additional quark families. In this case, the CKM matrix is extended due to the mixing between the SM quarks and the new hypothesised ones. This would imply that the CKM matrix elements |V tb |, |V ts |, and |V td | would not necessarily satisfy the unitarity constraint of |V tb | 2 + |V ts | 2 + |V td | 2 = 1. If these BSM quarks are heavier than the top quark, they would alter the CKM matrix elements without appearing as top quark decay products. They would thus not contribute directly to the top quark decay width t , but only indirectly because of the reduction in the absolute values of the corresponding SM CKM matrix elements. For the first BSM scenario, we assume the top quark decays through the same channels as in the SM case, and that the partial width of each decay only varies because of a modified CKM matrix element. In this case, by writing t and q as a function of |V tb | 2 and |V td | 2 + |V ts | In this scenario, the measurement is performed leaving |V tb | and |V td | 2 +|V ts | 2 as free parameters in the fit, resulting in: |V tb | = 0.988 \u00b1 0.027 (stat+prof) \u00b1 0.043 (nonprof)",

The measurements presented here establish a model-independent upper limit on |V td | and |V ts | by removing any assumed theoretical hypotheses.
