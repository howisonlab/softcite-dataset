No signal for the Y (4140) \u2192 \u03c6J/\u03c8 is observed. But a narrow peak with a significance of 3.2\u03c3 deviations including systematic uncertainty is observed at 4350.6 MeV/c 2 that we named X(4350). We also search for charmonium-like states, including X(3872), Y (4140), X(3915) and X(4350), in \u03a5(1S) and \u03a5(2S) radiative decays. No significant signal of any charmoniumlike state is observed. The processes \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 V V (V = \u03c9 or \u03c6) are also measured to search for the possible exotic states in low mass region. There are clear resonant structures in all the decay modes.",

It is natural to extend the above theoretical picture to similar states coupling to \u03c9\u03c6, since the only difference between such states and the X(3915) 8 or X(4350) 3 is the replacement of the cc pair with a pair of light quarks. States coupling to \u03c9\u03c9 or \u03c6\u03c6 could also provide information on the classification of the low-lying states coupled to pairs of light vector mesons. The \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 V V cross sections are shown in Fig. 2. 9 The fraction of cross sections for different J P values as a function of M (V V ) is also shown in Fig. 2. We conclude that there are at least two different J P components (J = 0 and J = 2) in each of the three final states. The inset also shows the distribution of the cross section on a semi-logarithmic scale, where, in the high energy region, we fit the W \u2212n \u03b3\u03b3 dependence of the cross section. We observe clear structures at M (\u03c9\u03c6) \u223c 2.2 GeV/c 2 , M (\u03c6\u03c6) \u223c 2.35 GeV/c 2 , and M (\u03c9\u03c9) \u223c 2.0 GeV/c 2 .
