The analysis is based on 139 fb \u22121 of proton-proton collisions recorded by the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider at \u221a s = 13 TeV. Three R-parity-conserving scenarios where the lightest neutralino is the lightest supersymmetric particle are considered: the production of chargino pairs with decays via either W bosons or sleptons, and the direct production of slepton pairs. The analysis is optimised for the first of these scenarios, but the results are also interpreted in the others. No significant deviations from the Standard Model expectations are observed and limits at 95% confidence level are set on the masses of relevant supersymmetric particles in each of the scenarios. For a massless lightest neutralino, masses up to 420 GeV are excluded for the production of the lightest-chargino pairs assuming W -boson-mediated decays and up to 1 TeV for slepton-mediated decays, whereas for slepton-pair production masses up to 700 GeV are excluded assuming three generations of mass-degenerate sleptons.",

In SUSY models that conserve R-parity [12], SUSY particles (sparticles) must be produced in pairs. The lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) is stable and weakly interacting, thus potentially providing a viable candidate for dark matter [13,14]. Due to its stability, any LSP produced at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) would escape detection and give rise to momentum imbalance in the form of missing transverse momentum (p miss T ) in the final state, which can be used to discriminate SUSY signals from the SM background.",

The coloured sparticles (squarks and gluinos) are strongly produced and have significantly larger production cross-sections than non-coloured sparticles of equal masses, such as the sleptons (superpartners of the SM leptons) and the electroweakinos. If gluinos and squarks were much heavier than low-mass electroweakinos, then SUSY production at the LHC would be dominated by direct electroweakino production. The latest ATLAS and CMS limits on squark and gluino production [15][16][17][18][19][20][21][22][23] extend well beyond the TeV scale, thus making electroweak production of sparticles a promising and important probe in searches for SUSY at the LHC. 1 production with slepton/sneutrino-mediated-decays and c slepton pair production. In the model with intermediate sleptons, all three flavours (\u1ebd,\u03bc,\u03c4 ) are included, while only\u1ebd and\u03bc are included in the direct slepton model. In the final state, stands for an electron or muon, which can be produced directly or, in the case of a and b only, via a leptonically decaying \u03c4 -lepton with additional neutrinos This paper presents a search for the electroweak production of charginos and sleptons decaying into final states with two charged leptons (electrons and/or muons) using 139 fb \u22121 of proton-proton collision data recorded by the ATLAS detector at the LHC at \u221a s = 13 TeV. The analysis is optimised to target the direct production of\u03c7 + 1\u03c7 \u2212 1 , where each chargino decays into the LSP\u03c7 0 1 and an on-shell W boson. Signal events are characterised by the presence of exactly two isolated leptons (e, \u03bc) with opposite electric charge, and significant p miss T (the magnitude of which is referred to as E miss T ), expected from neutrinos and LSPs in the final states. The same analysis strategy is also applied to two other searches. One of them is the search for the direct production of\u03c7 + 1\u03c7 \u2212 1 , where each chargino decays into a slepton (charged slepton\u02dc or sneutrino\u03bd) via the emission of a lepton (neutrino \u03bd or charged lepton ) and the slepton itself decays into a lepton and the LSP. The other one is the search for the direct pair production of sleptons where each slepton decays into a lepton and the LSP.",

The\u03c7 \u00b1 1 is assumed to be pure wino and two possible decay modes are considered. The first is a decay into the\u03c7 0 1 via emission of a W boson, which may decay into an electron or muon plus neutrino(s) either directly or through the emission of a leptonically decaying \u03c4 -lepton (Fig. 1a). The second decay mode proceeds via a slepton-neutrino/sneutrino-lepton pair (Fig. 1b). In this case it is assumed that the scalar partners of the left-handed charged leptons and neutrinos are also light and thus accessible in the sparticle decay chains. It is also assumed they are mass-degenerate, and their masses are chosen to be midway between the mass of the chargino and that of the\u03c7 0 1 , which is pure bino. Equal branching ratios for the three slepton flavours are assumed and charginos decay into charged sleptons or sneutrinos with a branching ratio of 50% to each. Lepton flavour is conserved in all models. In models with direct\u02dc \u02dc production (Fig. 1c), each slepton decays into a lepton and a\u03c7 0 1 with a 100% branching ratio.

The dominant sources of systematic uncertainty are related to theoretical uncertainties in the MC modelling, while the largest sources of experimental uncertainty are related to the jet energy scale (JES) and jet energy resolution (JER). The statistical uncertainty in the simulated event samples is also accounted for. Since the normalisation of the predictions for the dominant background processes is extracted from dedicated control regions, the systematic uncertainties only affect the extrapolation to the signal regions in these cases. The JES and JER uncertainties are considered as a function of jet p T and \u03b7, the pile-up conditions and the flavour composition of the selected jet sample. They are derived using a combination of data and simulation, through measurements of the transverse momentum balance between a jet and a reference object in dijet, Z +jets and \u03b3 +jets events [91]. An additional uncertainty in p miss T comes from the soft-term resolution and scale [96]. Uncertainties in the scale factors applied to the simulated samples to account for differences between data and simulation in the b-jet identification efficiency are also included. The remaining experimental systematic uncertainties, such as those in the lepton reconstruc-tion efficiency, lepton energy scale and lepton energy resolution and differences between the trigger efficiencies in data and simulation are included and are found to be a few per mille in all channels. The reweighting procedure (pile-up reweighting) applied to simulation to match the distribution of the number of interactions per bunch crossing observed in data results in a negligible contribution to the total systematic uncertainty.",

The analysis uses 139 fb \u22121 of \u221a s = 13 TeV proton-proton collisions recorded by the ATLAS detector at the LHC between 2015 and 2018. Three scenarios are considered: the production of lightest-chargino pairs, followed by their decays into final states with leptons and the light-est neutralino via either W bosons or sleptons/sneutrinos, and direct production of slepton pairs, where each slepton decays directly into the lightest neutralino and a lepton and different assumptions about the masses of the superpartners of the left-handed and right-handed charged leptons,\u1ebd L ,\u1ebd R , \u03bc L and\u03bc R , are considered. No significant deviations from the Standard Model expectations are observed and limits at 95% CL are set on the masses of relevant supersymmetric particles in each of these scenarios. For a massless lightest neutralino, masses up to 420 GeV are excluded for the production of the lightest-chargino pairs assuming W -bosonmediated decays and up to 1 TeV for slepton-pair-mediated decays, whereas for slepton-pair production masses up to 700 GeV are excluded assuming three generations of mass-     ",

            "text": "manuscript has no associated data or the data will not be deposited. [Authors' comment: All ATLAS scientific output is published in journals, and preliminary results are made available in Conference Notes. All are openly available, without restriction on use by external parties beyond copyright law and the standard conditions agreed by CERN. Data associated with journal publications are also made available: tables and data from plots (e.g. cross section values, likelihood profiles, selection efficiencies, cross section limits, ...) are stored in appropriate repositories such as HEPDATA (http:// hepdata.cedar.ac.uk/). ATLAS also strives to make additional material related to the paper available that allows a reinterpretation of the data in the context of new theoretical models. For example, an extended encapsulation of the analysis is often provided for measurements in the framework of RIVET (http://rivet.hepforge.org/).
