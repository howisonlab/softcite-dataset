The J/\u03c8 and \u03c8(2S) charmonium states and the first three \u03a5(nS) bottomonium states, all spin-triplet S-wave quarkonium states below open-heavy-flavor thresholds, have relatively large branching ratios to e \u2212 e + or \u00b5 \u2212 \u00b5 + pairs. In hadron collisions, experiments measuring lepton pairs can determine polarization by using angular correlation techniques. The polarization, in turn, can be related theoretically to the production mechanism for the bound state. This review summarizes experimental studies with proton beams at fixed target and colliding beam accelerators, covering a center-of-mass energy range from 39 to 7000 GeV for nucleon and antiproton targets. Analyses using various polarization frames and spin-quantization axes are described and results compared. A pattern emerges that connects experimental results over the whole energy span. The theoretical implications of the pattern are presented and a set of new measurements is proposed.",

            "text": "The goal of quarkonium polarization measurements in high-energy hadron collisions is to determine the mechanisms by which a heavy quark-antiquark pair is produced by partonparton collisions and by which it subsequently binds into a colorless meson H. The relevant kinematic variables for inclusive production of H are its transverse momentum p T and a longitudinal variable, 1 either its rapidity y or its Feynman variable x F . Despite the complexity of describing strong production processes using Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), two simplifications arise for quarkonium production due to the heavy quark's mass being much larger than the light-quark interaction energy scale \u039b QCD . First, the asymptotic freedom of the QCD coupling constant allows the creation of the heavy quarks to be described perturbatively, provided also that the quarkonium state H has sufficient transverse momentum to suppress interactions of the heavy quarks with the light-parton remnants of the colliding hadrons. Second, the nonrelativistic velocities of the heavy quarks in the rest frame of H simplify the nonperturbative dynamics of the formation of the bound state. The spin structure of the matrix element for the parity-conserving electromagnetic decay into leptons is completely determined by Lorentz invariance. The decay angular distribution of the leptons carries information about the spin density matrix for the vector quarkonium and therefore about the process by which that quarkonium was produced. Experiments can determine the variation of the decay angular distribution with kinematic variables. Theory has to provide the interpretive framework to relate the data to the dominant matrix elements for the production process. This review will consider the present state of both sides of this interpretive equation.",

Because of the parity symmetry of QCD, a collision of unpolarized hadrons cannot produce a vector meson with different probabilities for the spin states +1 and \u22121. We will consider a vector meson to have a net polarization if the probabilities for a single transverse spin state and the longitudinal spin state differ. 2 When a vector meson decays into a lepton pair, its polarization is reflected in the angular distribution of the leptons, as specified, e.g., in terms of the spherical angles \u03b8 and \u03c6 for the momentum vector of the positively charged lepton in the rest frame of the vector meson. In order to define those angles, it is necessary to choose a polarization frame. The angle \u03b8 is the polar angle with respect to the spin-quantization axis. An orthogonal axis in the collision plane must be specified to define the zero of the azimuthal angle. For inclusive hadroproduction of a vector meson, the only available vectors are the momenta of the vector meson and the colliding hadrons. In the rest frame of the vector meson, the two orthogonal axes lie in the collision plane defined by the boosted momenta of the colliding hadrons.",

In experiments with higher statistics, the three polarization parameters can be determined with smaller systematic errors from measurements of the twodimensional distribution in Eq. 1. The statistics in those measurements can be improved by exploiting two symmetries of the angular distribution in Eq. 1: \u03c6 \u2192 \u2212\u03c6 and (\u03b8, \u03c6) \u2192 (\u03c0 \u2212 \u03b8, \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c6).

They could also be useful in theoretical calculations to check whether error estimates on predictions of the polarization are underestimated.

The creation of a QQ pair in a collision of light partons involves a momentum transfer of order m Q , where m Q is the heavy-quark mass. The creation of a QQ pair with transverse momentum p T much larger than m Q involves a momentum transfer of order p T . In an amplitude involving large p T , some factors of the QCD coupling constant should be \u03b1 s (p T ), while others may more appropriately be \u03b1 s (m Q ). If the momentum scales m Q and p T are not separated, the momentum scales in all factors of \u03b1 s are usually set to a common value, such as (m 2 Q +p 2 T ) 1/2 . In a pQCD calculation, we will refer to the first few terms in the expansion in powers of \u03b1 s as leading order (LO), next-to-leading order (NLO), and next-to-next-to-leading order (N 2 LO).",

The pQCD cross sections are essentially inclusive partonic cross sections for producing a collinear QQ pair, which can be expanded in powers of \u03b1 s (p T ), convolved with parton distributions for the colliding hadrons A and B. The double-parton fragmentation functions D (QQ)n\u2192H (z, \u03b6, \u03b6 ) are nonperturbative probability distributions in the longitudinal momentum fraction z of the quarkonium H relative to the QQ pair that also depend on the relative longitudinal momentum fractions \u03b6 and \u03b6 of the Q and theQ. The \"\u2297\" in Eq. 8 represents integrals over z, \u03b6, and \u03b6 . The NLP fragmentation formula is obtained by adding Eq. (10) to Eq. (8). The evolution equations for the fragmentation functions can be used to sum large logarithms of p T /m Q to all orders in \u03b1 s . A similar factorization formula has been derived by Fleming et al. using soft collinear effective theory [23,24], but it is not identical. In particular, the form of the evolution equations for the fragmentation functions is different in the two approaches. The NLP fragmentation formula lacks predictive power, because the double-parton fragmentation functions are nonperturbative functions of z, \u03b6, and \u03b6 that must be determined phenomenologically. Predictive power can be achieved by applying the NRQCD factorization conjecture to the fragmentation functions. The double-parton fragmentation functions D (QQ)n\u2192H (z, \u03b6, \u03b6 ) have expansions in terms of the NRQCD matrix elements analogous to that for the single-parton fragmentation function D i\u2192H (z) in Eq. 9 [25,26]. The NRQCDexpanded NLP fragmentation formula should reproduce the power expansion of the NRQCD factorization cross section in Eq. 7 up to order m 2 Q /p 2 T . Kang, Qiu, and Sterman have taken the first step towards analyzing the effects of QQ fragmentation on the polarization of quarkonium [22]. For a spin-triplet S-wave quarkonium state, the only QQ fragmentation function that is nonzero at LO in \u03b1 s is the color-octet axial-vector fragmentation function. Its contribution to the cross section is increasingly longitudinal in the cm-helicity frame as p T increases. They argued that the observed polarization of quarkonium could arise from a competition between a transversely polarized contribution from gluon fragmentation and a longitudinally polarized contribution from QQ fragmentation. At very large p T , the leading power correction to the polarization comes from interference between gluon fragmentation and QQ fragmentation, and it falls like a single power of m Q /p T [27]. Thus NLP factorization predicts that the polarization at large p T should eventually be increasingly transverse, as predicted by LP factorization, but this asymptotic behavior may not appear until very large p T .",

            "text": "In order to use option (a), the experiment has to have a tracking detector with low average occupancy, so that lepton track reconstruction is unlikely to be distorted by the presence of other tracks in the event. For option (b) with Pythia generation, the simulation procedure generates the quarkonium kinematics and also produces the decay. If reweighting has to be done to match kinematic parameters, it occurs ex post facto, and there can be distortion of the generated event distribution in the quarkonium rest frame due to reweighting. The quantization axis of the generated event is not the same as the corresponding quantity after reweighting. Of course, the extent of any such shift can be studied and its impact on the polarization parameters evaluated within the Monte Carlo framework. The lepton detection efficiency can vary with the kinematic variables of the lepton , usually its transverse momentum p T ( ) with respect to the beam direction and its pseudorapidity \u03b7( ) = \u2212 ln[tan(\u03b8/2)]. The tag-and-probe method of efficiency determination is used in most modern experiments [52]. The probe track, unbiassed by a trigger, is either passed or failed by the analysis criteria. Probe track efficiencies in (p T , \u03b7) bins can give the distribution of the trigger and detection efficiency for a single track as a function of its kinematic parameters. The tag-and-probe method can also be applied to Monte Carlo samples with large statistics. If the simulation and data efficiency distributions agree, then one can use the Monte Carlo shape to fit to the data in order to improve knowledge of the kinematic variation of efficiencies. In some experiments, tag-and-probe studies are not possible, so simulation studies provide both efficiency and acceptance. This introduces a level of uncertainty into the results that can be hard to quantify.",

Both use nuclear targets. At these center-of-mass energies, \u03c8(2S) production and non-prompt J/\u03c8 production are negligible. The transverse momentum p T is, at best, comparable to the charmonium mass. Because these are well-discussed experiments, we only summarize their results. For NuSea, the polarization parameter \u03bb \u03b8 in the Collins-Soper (CS) frame for J/\u03c8 polarization is small over the p T range < 4 GeV, with an average of +0.15 for x F = 0.45. For HERA-B, the effective \u03bb \u03b8 parameter in the CS frame is negative, averaging to \u22120.18 for x F = \u22120.12.

In Fig. 5, we plot the \u03bb \u03b8 parameters for the CMS and CDF measurements in the cmhelicity frame for the 1S states of bottomonium and charmonium as a function of the transverse mass m T = m 2 + p 2",

One sees two features in this figure: (a) in each experiment, the polarization parameters of the two onia ground states are nearly the same and show the same trend with m T ; and (b) the trends in the cm-helicity frame are different for pp and pp. The pp results are consistent with no m T dependence and a constant \u03bb \u03b8 = 0.13 \u00b1 0.04. The pp \u03bb \u03b8 parameter shows a linear decrease starting at zero near m T = 7 GeV with a slope of (\u22120.015\u00b1 0.003)/GeV. Again, this may indicate a target-dependent effect that makes the polarization different for pp and pp. For both types of target, the polarization mechanism at large m T seems to be independent of heavy-quark flavor, since the J/\u03c8 and \u03a5(1S) polarization parameters follow the same pattern for each target particle.",

            "text": "The question of to what extent feeddown influences the polarization of the lowest-lying quarkonium states has been raised repeatedly. The best chance to measure these effects seems to be in the large datasets collected at the LHC. Colliding beam experiments at the Tevatron and LHC have identified radiative decays of P -wave quarkonium states to the S-wave ground state using photon conversions in the material of the inner tracker. With larger data sets yet unanalyzed, one might hope to measure the polarization of the ground-state quarkonia that result from P -wave decay sources. We see in Fig. 5 that the polarization parameters of the \u03a5(1S) and J/\u03c8 mesons for m T > 10 GeV are consistent with each other and have little variation with p T in either the cm-helicity or CS frames. A first step in understanding feeddown effects would be to measure the polarization of the J/\u03c8 produced from \u03c7 c decays and of \u03a5(1S) produced from \u03c7 b (1P ) decays, using conversion photons combined with reconstructed dimuon events to identify the P -wave parent event candidates. One need not separate the \u03c7 QJ states with different J. There are already measurements of the J = 2 to J = 1 ratios for the \u03c7 c at the Tevatron and LHC. We encourage the experimenters to pursue the determination of the J/\u03c8 polarization in \u03c7 c events and to extend the studies to measure the \u03a5(1S) polarization in \u03c7 b radiative decays. From the results that we have seen, it should be adequate to measure \u03bb \u03b8 with respect to two spinquantization axes, the CS frame and either the cm-helicity frame or, if the measurements extend out to large rapidity, the \u22a5-helicity frame. Because one is not measuring a cross section but rather a ratio of longitudinal and transverse polarization contributions, the absolute photon conversion efficiency is not needed. A good determination of the energy dependence of the conversion efficiency is crucial, though, to handle the range of photon energies for candidate events. The fundamental question is whether the polarization from these decays is different from the inclusive prompt polarization for the J/\u03c8 or \u03a5(1S). The answer will directly aid future theoretical analysis of quarkonium polarization.",
