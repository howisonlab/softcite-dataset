Measurements of the central rapidity yields of \u039e \u2212 and \u2126 \u2212 baryons, as well as their antiparticles, are presented as a function of transverse momentum (p t ) for inelastic pp collisions at \u221a s = 7 TeV and compared to existing measurements performed at the same and/or at lower energies. The results are also compared to predictions from two different tunes of the PYTHIA event generator. We find that data significantly exceed the production rates from those models. Finally, we present the status of the multi-strange particle production studies in Pb-Pb at \u221a s N N = 2.76 TeV performed as a function of collision centrality.",

            "text": "The study of charged multi-strange particles in high-energy proton-proton collisions serves not only as an important benchmark for heavy-ion collisions, but it can also provide us with information pertinent to the interplay between different particle production mechanisms. At low transverse momenta, soft interactions are the dominant source of particle production, while at high p t perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD) processes take over as the most significant mechanism. Information on these mechanisms can be used to constrain the phenomenology of QCD-inspired models and event generators such as PYTHIA [1]. The multi-strange baryons are of particular interest as the colliding particles have no net strangeness content, so that any open strangeness must have been created in the collision.",

The cascade decay candidates at mid-rapidity (|y| \u2264 0.5) are reconstructed out of combinations of high-quality tracks as measured by the ALICE time projection chamber (TPC) and the silicon Inner Tracking System (ITS) [3]. Further selections applied to these candidates include topological cuts and particle identification by energy loss while traversing the TPC gas. In addition, for the \u2126, we reject all candidates whose invariant mass under the \u039e mass hypothesis is less than 8 MeV/c 2 from the \u039e nominal mass. The number of counts in each p t bin is taken within 4.5\u03c3 from the invariant mass peak after background subtraction, where we determine the background in the regions from 4.5\u03c3 up to 9\u03c3 away from the peak. In order to compute detection efficiency, we used \u039e \u00b1 or \u2126 \u00b1 enhanced Monte Carlo event generators such that every simulated event has at least one \u039e or \u2126 baryon, and subsequent propagation of the particles is performed through the full ALICE geometry with GEANT3 [4,5].",
