Results are based on data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb \u22121 of proton-proton collisions at \u221a s = 8 TeV, collected using the CMS detector at the LHC. For a high-mass ( 1 TeV) resonance, the two bottom quarks coming from the Higgs boson decay are reconstructed as a single jet, which can be tagged by placing requirements on its substructure and flavour. Exclusion limits at 95 % confidence level are set on the production cross section of a narrow resonance decaying into WH, as a function of its mass. In the context of a little Higgs model, a lower limit on the W mass of 1.4 TeV is set. In a heavy vector triplet model that mimics the properties of composite Higgs models, a lower limit on the W mass of 1.5 TeV is set. In the context of this model, the results are combined with related searches to obtain a lower limit on the W mass of 1.8 TeV, the most restrictive to date for decays to a pair of standard model bosons.",

Such processes are distinctive features of several extensions of the SM such as composite Higgs [5][6][7], SU(5)/SO(5) Littlest Higgs (LH) [8][9][10][11], technicolor [12,13], and left-right symmetric models [14]. These models provide solutions to the hierarchy problem and predict new particles including additional gauge bosons such as a heavy W . The W in these models can have large branching fractions to WH and WZ, while the decays to fermions can be suppressed. The recently proposed heavy vector triplet (HVT) model [15] generalizes a large class of specific models that predict new heavy spin-1 vector bosons. In this model, the resonance is described by a simplified Lagrangian in e-mail: cms-publication-committee-chair@cern.ch terms of a small number of parameters representing its mass and couplings to SM bosons and fermions.",

The CMS tracker consists of 1440 silicon pixel and 15 148 silicon strip detector modules covering a pseudorapidity range of |\u03b7| < 2.5. The ECAL consists of nearly 76 000 lead tungstate crystals, which provide coverage of |\u03b7| < 1.48 in the central barrel region and 1.48 < |\u03b7| < 3.00 in the two forward endcap regions. The HCAL consists of a sampling calorimeter [28], which utilizes alternating layers of brass as an absorber and plastic scintillator as an active material, covering the range |\u03b7| < 3, and is extended to |\u03b7| < 5 by a forward hadron calorimeter. Muons are measured in the range |\u03b7| < 2.4 with detection planes which employ three technologies: drift tubes, cathode strip chambers, and resistiveplate chambers. The muon trigger combines the information from the three sub-detectors with a coverage up to |\u03b7| < 2.1.

In the jetclustering procedure, charged PF candidates associated with pileup vertices are excluded, to reduce contamination from pileup. In order to identify a Higgs boson decaying into bottom quarks, jets are clustered using the Cambridge-Aachen algorithm [55] with a distance parameter of 0.8 (\"CA8 jets\"). Only the highest p T CA8 jet is used. Jets in the event are also identified using the anti-k T jet-clustering algorithm [56] with a distance parameter of 0.5 (\"AK5 jets\"). AK5 jets are required to be separated from the CA8 jet by \u0394R > 0.8. An event-by-event correction based on the projected area of the jet on the front face of the calorimeter is used to remove the extra energy deposited in jets by neutral particles coming from pileup. Furthermore, jet energy corrections are applied, based on measurements in dijet and photon+jet events in data [57]. Additional quality criteria are applied to the jets in order to remove spurious jet-like features originating from calorimeter noise [58]. The CA8 (AK5) jets are required to be separated from the selected electron or muon candidate by \u0394R > 0.8 (0.3). Only jets with p T > 30 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.4 are allowed in the subsequent steps of the analysis. Furthermore, CA8 jets are not used in the analysis if their pseudorapidity falls in the region 1.0 < |\u03b7| < 1.8, thus overlapping the barrel-endcap transition region of the silicon tracker. In that region, 'noise' can arise when the tracking algorithm reconstructs many fake displaced tracks associated with the jet. The simulation does not sufficiently describe the full material budget of the tracking detector in that region, thus it does not accurately describe this effect. Without this requirement, a bias can be introduced in the b tagging, jet substructure and missing transverse momentum information, making this analysis systematically prone to that noise. The probability of signal events satisfying the requirement that the pseudorapidity of the CA8 jet falls outside the region 1.0 < |\u03b7| < 1.8 is 80 % (92 %) for a resonance mass of 1.0 (2.5) TeV.",

More details on the p miss T performance in CMS can be found in Refs. [60,61]. A requirement of p miss T > 80 (40) GeV is applied for the electron (muon) channel. The higher threshold for the electron channel is motivated by the higher contribution from the multijet background expected in the lowp miss T range due to jets misidentified as electrons. The background is expected to be negligible in the muon channel, for which a lower p miss T threshold can be used to preserve a higher efficiency for a low-mass signal.",

We exploit two techniques to discriminate against quark and gluon jets from the multijet background, including the requirement that the reconstructed jet mass be close to the Higgs boson mass, and b tagging methods that discriminate jets originating from the b quarks from those originating from lighter quarks or gluons. First, we apply a jet-grooming technique [26,63] to recluster the jet constituents, while applying additional requirements to remove possible contamination from soft QCD radiation or pileup. Different jet-grooming algorithms have been explored at CMS, and their performance on jets in multijet processes has been studied in detail [63]. In this analysis, we use the jet pruning algorithm [64,65], which re-clusters each jet starting from all its original constituents using the CA algorithm iteratively, while discarding soft and largeangle recombinations at each step. The performance of the algorithm depends on the two parameters, z cut = 0.1 and D cut = m jet / p jet T , which define the maximum allowed hardness and the angle of the recombinations in the clustering algorithm, respectively. A jet is considered as an H-tagged jet candidate if its pruned mass, m jet , computed from the sum of the four-momenta of the constituents surviving the pruning, falls in the range 110 < m jet < 135 GeV. The m jet window is the result of an optimization based on signal sensitivity and on the constraints due to the higher bounds of the signal regions of other diboson analyses [25].",

In addition, we apply topological selection criteria, requiring that the W and Higgs bosons are approximately back-to-back, since they tend to be isotropically distributed for background events. In particular, the \u0394R distance between the lepton and the H-tagged jet must be greater than \u03c0/2, the azimuthal angular separation between the p miss T and the H-tagged jet must be greater than 2.0 radians, and the azimuthal angular separation between the W \u2192 \u03bd and H-tagged jet candidates must be greater than 2.0 radians. To further reduce the level of the tt background, events with one or more reconstructed AK5 jets, not overlapping with the CA8 H-tagged jet candidate as described previously in Sect. 4.3, are analyzed. If one or more of the AK5 jets is b-tagged, the event is rejected. Furthermore, a leptonically decaying top quark candidate mass m top is reconstructed from the lepton, p miss T , and the closest AK5 jet to the lepton using the method described in Ref. [62]. A hadronically decaying top quark candidate mass m h top is reconstructed from the CA8 H-tagged jet candidate and the closest AK5 jet.

For the W+jets normalization estimate, a signal-depleted control region is defined outside the m jet mass window described in Sect. 4.5. A lower sideband region is defined in the m jet range [40,110] GeV as well as an upper sideband in the range [135, 150] GeV. The overall normalization of the W+jets background in the signal region is determined from the likelihood of the sum of backgrounds fit to the m jet distribution in both sidebands of the observed data. In this approach, simulated events are replaced by an analytical function, which has been determined individually for each background process.

In this process, variations in the lepton E or p T are propagated consistently to the p miss T vector. We also take into account the systematic uncertainties affecting the observed-to-simulated scale factors for the efficiencies of the lepton trigger, identification and isolation requirements. These efficiencies are derived using a specialized tag-and-probe analysis with Z \u2192 + \u2212 events [69], and the uncertainty in the ratio of the efficiencies is taken as the systematic uncertainty. The uncertainties in the efficiencies of the electron (muon) trigger and the electron (muon) identification with isolation are 3 % (3 %) and 3 % (4 %), respectively. The signal efficiency is also affected by the uncertainties in the jet energy-momentum scale and resolution. The jet energy-momentum scale and resolution are varied within their p T -and \u03b7-dependent uncertainties [57] to estimate their impact on the signal efficiency.

            "text": "A search has been presented for new resonances decaying into WH, in which the W boson decays into \u03bd with = e, \u03bc and the Higgs boson decays to a pair of bottom quarks. Each event is reconstructed as a leptonic W boson candidate recoiling against a jet with mass compatible with the Higgs boson mass. A specialized b tagging method for Lorentz-boosted Higgs bosons is used to further reduce the background from multijet processes. No excess of events above the standard model prediction is observed in the muon channel, while an excess with a local significance of 2.9 standard deviations is observed in the electron channel near M WH \u2248 1.8 TeV. The results are statistically compatible with the standard model within 2 standard deviations. In the context of the little Higgs and the heavy vector triplet models, upper limits at 95 % confidence level are set on the W production cross section in a range from 100 to 10 fb for masses between 0.8 and 2.5 TeV, respectively. Within the little Higgs model, a lower limit on the W mass of 1.4 TeV has been set. A heavy vector triplet model that mimics the properties of composite Higgs models has been excluded up to a W mass of 1.5 TeV. In this latter context, the results have been combined with related searches, improving the lower limit up to \u22481.8 TeV. This combined limit is the most restrictive to date for W decays to a pair of standard model bosons. accelerator departments for the excellent performance of the LHC and thank the technical and administrative staffs at CERN and at other CMS institutes for their contributions to the success of the CMS effort.
