The data, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb \u22121 , were recorded with the ATLAS detector in 2015 and 2016 at the Large Hadron Collider. The searches are performed in final states in which one Z boson decays into either a pair of light charged leptons (electrons and muons) or a pair of neutrinos, and the associated W boson or the other Z boson decays hadronically. No evidence of the production of heavy resonances is observed. Upper bounds on the production cross sections of heavy resonances times their decay branching ratios to ZZ or ZW are derived in the mass range 300-5000 GeV within the context of Standard Model extensions with additional Higgs bosons, a heavy vector triplet or warped extra dimensions. Production through gluon-gluon fusion, Drell-Yan or vector-boson fusion are considered, depending on the assumed model.",

Subsequent studies [3][4][5][6] have shown that the properties of the new particle are consistent with those of the Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson. Nevertheless, the possibility that JHEP03(2018)009  the particle is part of an extended Higgs sector or other extension of the SM cannot be ruled out. Many of these models, motivated by hierarchy and naturalness arguments [7][8][9], predict the existence of new heavy resonances decaying into dibosons. In models with an extended Higgs sector, such as the two-Higgs-doublet models (2HDM) [10] and the electroweak-singlet model [11], a heavy spin-0 neutral Higgs boson (H) can decay into a pair of Z bosons. In extended gauge models [12], a heavier version of the SM W boson (W ) is predicted to decay into ZW , and in models with warped extra dimensions [13,14], spin-2 Kaluza-Klein (KK) excitations of the graviton (G KK ) are expected to decay into ZZ.",

When the resonance mass is significantly higher than the V boson mass, the qq pair from the V boson decay can be collimated. In this case, hadrons from the two quarks overlap in the detector and are more efficiently reconstructed as a single large-radius jet (large-R jet, or J). The X \u2192 ZV \u2192 qq searche utilises both reconstruction techniques for the V \u2192 qq decay, whereas the X \u2192 ZV \u2192 \u03bd\u03bdqq search uses only the merged reconstruction.",

Different resonances are predicted by each of these: a neutral heavy spin-0 Higgs boson H using the narrow-width approximation [26], a spin-1 W boson of the heavy vector triplet (HVT) model [27,28], and a spin-2 KK graviton G KK from the bulk Randall-Sundrum model [13,29,30]. The new HVT bosons couple to the SM Higgs boson and gauge bosons with coupling strength c H g V and to the SM fermions with coupling strength (g 2 /g V )c F , where g is the SM SU(2) L coupling constant. The parameter g V characterises the interaction strength of the new vector bosons, while the dimensionless coefficients c H and c F parameterise departures of this typical strength from interactions with the SM Higgs and gauge bosons and with fermions, respectively, and are expected to be of order unity in most models. In Model A with g V = 1, the branching ratios of the new heavy vector boson to known fermions and gauge bosons are comparable, while in Model B with g V = 3, fermionic couplings to the new heavy vector boson are suppressed, giving rise to larger branching ratios for decays into ZW final states than in Model A. In a third model, VBF Model, the couplings to gauge bosons are similar to those in Model A, but the couplings to fermions are set to 0. In the bulk RS graviton model, the G KK couplings to light fermions are suppressed and decays into final states involving heavy fermions, gauge bosons or Higgs bosons are favoured. The strength of the coupling depends on k/M Pl , where k corresponds to the curvature of the warped extra dimension and M Pl is the effective four-dimensional Planck scale M Pl = 2.4 \u00d7 10 18 GeV. The cross section and intrinsic width scale as the square of k/M Pl .",

Both the ggF and VBF production processes are considered. Benchmark samples of HVT W \u2192 ZW and RS graviton G KK \u2192 ZZ were generated with MadGraph5 aMC@NLO 2.2.2 [36], using the NNPDF23LO [37] PDF set. For the HVT model, two production modes of the charged vector triplet W , DY and VBF, are considered. The W resonance from DY production of Model A has a width approximately 2.6% of its mass, while for VBF production the width is much narrower, JHEP03(2018)009 since its couplings to fermions are set to 0 in the VBF signal. For HVT Model B, the resonance widths and experimental signatures are similar to those obtained for Model A. Thus results derived from Model A can be directly applied to benchmark Model B by rescaling the relevant branching ratios. The G KK has a mass-dependent width, 3.7% at 500 GeV and 6.4% at 5000 GeV relative to its mass, for k/M Pl = 1. An RS graviton with k/M Pl = 0.5 is also considered and the samples were obtained by reweighting the generated samples for k/M Pl = 1 to account for the resonance width and cross-section differences. The parton showering and hadronisation were modelled with Pythia 8.186 [38] using the A14 set of the tuned parameters (tune) for the underlying event [39] for the W and G KK samples and the AZNLO tune [40] for the H samples. Potential signal and background interference effects were ignored in the signal modelling.",

            "text": "MC simulated events are also used to model background processes. The main background sources are Z and W bosons produced in association with jets (Z+jets and W +jets), with significant contributions from top quark production (both tt pair and single-top) and non-resonant vector-boson pair production (ZZ, W Z and W W ). The Z+jets and W +jets events were simulated using the Sherpa 2.2.1 [41] event generator. Matrix elements were calculated for up to two partons at NLO and up to four partons at LO using the Comix [42] and OpenLoops [43] programs. Diboson processes with one of the bosons decaying hadronically and the other leptonically were simulated using Sherpa 2.1.0. They were simulated for up to one (ZZ) or zero (W Z, W W ) additional partons at NLO and up to three additional partons at LO using the Comix and OpenLoops programs. For both Z+jets and diboson simulation, the matrix-element calculations were merged with the Sherpa parton shower using the ME+PS@NLO prescription [44]. The CT10 PDF set was used in conjunction with a dedicated parton shower tuning developed by the Sherpa authors. The Z \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 and W \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd events were included in the Z+jets and W +jets samples. For the generation of top quark pairs, the Powheg-Box v2 [45] event generator with the CT10 PDF set in the matrix element calculations was used. Electroweak t-channel, s-channel and W t-channel single-top quark events were generated using the Powheg-Box v1 event generator [46][47][48]. This event generator uses the four-flavour scheme for the NLO matrixelement calculations together with the fixed four-flavour PDF set CT10f4 [35]. For all top quark processes, top quark spin correlations were preserved (for t-channel, top quarks were decayed using MadSpin). The parton shower, fragmentation, and underlying event were simulated using Pythia 6.428 [49] with the CTEQ6L1 [50] PDF set and the corresponding Perugia 2012 tune (P2012) [51]. The top quark mass was set to 172.5 GeV. The EvtGen v1.2.0 program [52] was used to decay bottom and charm hadrons for the Powheg-Box samples.",

These subjets are discarded if they carry less than a specific fraction (f cut ) of the original jet p T . The trimming parameters optimised for this search are R subjet = 0.2 and f cut = 5%.

Electrons are more susceptible to charge misidentification due to the conversions of photons from bremsstrahlung, especially at high E T . The dilepton invariant mass m is required to be consistent with the Z boson mass. For electrons, a fixed m window [83,99] GeV is applied. To account for the effect of dimuon massresolution degradation at high transverse momentum (p T ), a p T -dependent mass window [85.6 GeV \u2212 0.0117p T , 94.0 GeV + 0.0185p T ] is used for muons. For both electrons and muons, the mass windows are chosen to ensure that the Z \u2192 selection efficiency is approximately 95% and independent of the heavy resonance mass. Events with additional leptons passing the 'loose' criteria are vetoed. The VBF category is targeted for VBF production whereas the ggF/DY category is for the rest, including events failing the selection for the VBF category. The selected VBF tag-jets are removed from the subsequent selection for the VBF category. However, if an event fails to be selected for the VBF category, these jets are kept for the ggF/DY category selection.

Given the negligible intrinsic widths of these resonances, the widths largely reflect the detector resolution. For DY-produced HVT W signal, the widths of the m J and m jj distributions are slightly larger at 3-4% since the W boson in this production mode has an intrinsic width of approximately 2.6% of its mass. The widths of the m J and m jj distributions are 4% at 500 GeV for the bulk RS graviton signal with k/M Pl = 1 and rise to 8% at 5000 GeV.

The shapes of the signal distributions are interpolated using the moment-morphing method [95] for intermediate mass points where simulated signal samples are not available. The product of acceptance and efficiency for each interpolated signal mass point is obtained from an interpolation with cubic splines between the simulated mass points. The Z+jets, W +jets and top quark control regions are included in the fit's likelihood calculation with one bin per region, i.e., using only their event-count information. Background contributions, including their shapes in the signal regions, are taken from MC simulations. However, they are allowed to vary independently within their uncertainties in each bin. Moreover, normalisation scale factors (SFs) are applied to the MC estimates of the Z+jets, W +jets and top quark contributions. These scale factors are free parameters in JHEP03(2018)009 the fit and are therefore constrained by the data in both the signal and control regions. The diboson contribution is constrained to the theoretical estimate within the corresponding uncertainties.",

Upper limits are set on the product of the production cross section of new resonances and their decay branching ratio to ZV , \u03c3 \u00d7 B(X \u2192 ZV ). Limits are presented for both the ggF and VBF productions of H \u2192 ZZ in figure 12 in the resonance mass range between 300 GeV and 3 TeV.

The observed limits exclude an HVT W boson produced in the DY process lighter than 2.9 TeV for Model A and 3.  the HVT model space can be excluded for the VBF process with the current sensitivity of the analysis. HVT models generally predict a near-by neutral vector boson (Z ) that decays into a Z boson and a SM Higgs boson h. The Z production could contaminate both the signal and control regions of the HVT W search. Assuming the Z \u2192 Zh production having the same cross section as the observed upper limit on \u03c3\u00d7B(W \u2192 ZW ), the impacts of the potential contamination to the W \u2192 ZW search are found to be negligible.",
