The corresponding hierarchy has not yet been confirmed in charmless baryonic B decays, which presumably proceed via b \u2192 s penguin or b \u2192 u tree diagrams. So far, many three-body charmless baryonic B decays have been observed but only very stringent upper limits have been set for quasi-two-body decays [5]. One intriguing experimental finding in charmless baryonic three-body decays is that all the baryon-antibaryon mass distributions peak near threshold. Many theoretical investigations, using QCD counting rules [6,7] or pole models [8,9] in the factorization approach, have been carried out for charmless baryonic B decays with p\u039b in the final state.",

A hint of a B + \u2192 p\u039bf 2 (1270) signal is found. This is the first observation of a four-body charmless baryonic B decay.

The branching fraction of the four-body decay is comparable to the corresponding three-body decays modes; however, the central values may indicate that the hierarchy established in the charmed case still holds for charmless baryonic decay. The observed branching fraction for B + \u2192 p\u039b\u03c1 0 is comparable to that for B 0 \u2192 p\u039b\u03c0 \u2212 , and is about an order of magnitude larger than the theoretical prediction [8].",
