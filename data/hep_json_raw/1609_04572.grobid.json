The decay of the Higgs boson is reconstructed as a high-momentum bb system with either a pair of small-radius jets, or a single large-radius jet with substructure. The observed data are found to be consistent with the expected backgrounds. Results are interpreted using a simplified model with a Z gauge boson mediating the interaction between dark matter and the Standard Model as well as a two-Higgs-doublet model containing an additional Z boson which decays to a Standard Model Higgs boson and a new pseudoscalar Higgs boson, the latter decaying into a pair of dark matter particles.",

The leading hypothesis suggests that most DM is in the form of stable, electrically neutral, massive particles with cosmological constraints indicating that DM interactions with Standard Model (SM) particles occur at a weak scale or below [2]. Collider-based searches for the particle content of DM provide important information complementary to that from direct and indirect detection experiments [3].",

            "text": "A traditional dark-matter signature at a proton-proton collider is one where one or more SM particles, X , are produced and detected, recoiling against missing transverse momentum -with magnitude E miss T -associated with the non-interacting DM candidate. A number of searches at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) [4] have been performed recently, where X is considered to be a hadronic jet [5,6], b-or t-quarks [7-9], a photon [10][11][12][13]  [20][21][22]. In contrast to most of the aforementioned probes, Higgs boson radiation from an initial-state quark is Yukawa-suppressed. As a result, in a potential signal the Higgs boson would be part of the interaction producing the DM, providing unique insight into the structure of the DM coupling to SM particles. Recently, the ATLAS Collaboration has published such searches using 20.3 fb \u22121 of proton-proton collision data at Many simplified models of DM production contain a massive particle which can be a vector, an axial-vector, a scalar or a pseudoscalar, and mediates the interaction between DM and Standard Model particles. In this search, simplified models involving a vector mediator are considered following the recommendation in Ref. [26].",

            "text": "In the first model [21], a vector mediator, Z , is exchanged in the s-channel, radiates the Higgs boson and decays into two DM particles. A diagram for this process is shown in Fig. 1(a). The vector mediator has an associated baryon number B, which is assumed to be gauge invariant under U (1) B thus allowing it to couple to quarks [27]. This symmetry is spontaneously broken to generate the Z mass. However, there is no Z coupling to leptons as such couplings are tightly constrained by dilepton searches. Finally, the dark-matter candidate carries a baryon number, which allows it to couple to quarks through the Z . The parameters of this model are as follows: the coupling of Z to dark matter (g \u03c7 ); the coupling of Z to quarks (g q ); the coupling of Z to the SM Higgs boson (g Z ); the mixing angle between the baryonic Higgs boson, introduced in the model to generate the Z mass, and the http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physletb.2016.11.035 0370-2693/\u00a9 2016 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V. This is an open access article under the CC BY license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). Funded by SCOAP 3 . In the second model, apart from the vector mediator, the SM is extended by an additional Higgs field doublet, resulting in five physical Higgs bosons [22]: a light scalar h associated with the observed Higgs boson, a heavy scalar H , a pseudoscalar A, and two charged scalars H \u00b1 . The vector mediator is produced resonantly and decays as Z \u2192 h A in a Type-II two-Higgs-doublet model (2HDM) [28]. The pseudoscalar A subsequently decays into two DM particles with a large branching ratio. A diagram for this process is shown in Fig. 1(b). To define the model, the ratio of the up-and down-type vacuum expectation values, tan \u03b2, must be specified along with the Z gauge coupling, g Z , the DM particle mass, m \u03c7 , and the Z and A masses, m Z and m A , respectively. The results presented are for the alignment limit, in which the h-H mixing angle \u03b1 is related to \u03b2 by \u03b1 = \u03b2 \u2212 \u03c0/2. Only regions of parameter space consistent with precision electroweak constraints [29] and with constraints from direct searches for dijet resonances [30-32] are considered. As the A boson is produced on-shell and decays into DM, the mass of the DM particle does not affect the kinematic properties or cross-section of the signal process if it is below half of the A boson mass. Hence, the Z -2HDM model is interpreted in the parameter spaces of Z mass (m Z ), A mass (m A ) and tan \u03b2.",

In both cases, the jets are reconstructed from topological clusters of calorimeter cells using the anti-k t jet clustering algorithm [65]. In the case of small-R jets, a radius parameter of R = 0.4 is used and the effects of pile-up are corrected for by a technique based on jet area [66]. In the case of large-R jets, a radius parameter of R = 1.0 is used and the jet trimming algorithm [67,68] is applied to minimise the impact of energy depositions due to pile-up and the underlying event. This algorithm reconstructs subjets within the large-R jet using the k t algorithm [69] with radius parameter R sub = 0.2 and removes any subjet with p T less than 5% of the large-R jet p T . The jet energy scale, and also in the case of large-R jets the jet mass scale, is calibrated using p T -and \u03b7-dependent factors determined from simulation, with small-R jets receiving further calibrations using in situ measurements [70]. Small-R jets within the ID acceptance, |\u03b7| < 2.5, are called central in the following and are required to satisfy p T > 20 GeV. Those with 2.5 < |\u03b7| < 4.5 are called forward and are required to satisfy p T > 30 GeV. To reduce the effects of pile-up in small-R jets with p T < 50 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.5, a significant fraction of the tracks associated with each jet must have an origin compatible with the primary vertex, as defined by the jet vertex tagger [71]. Furthermore, small-R jets are removed if they are within a R = 0.2 cone around an electron candidate. Large-R jets are required to satisfy p T > 250 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.0.",

The shape of the data distributions is described by the simulation with no indication that a correction is needed. A shape uncertainty in these variables is derived, encompassing the data/simulation differences. An uncertainty in the Sherpa description of the flavour composition of the jets in these backgrounds is derived by comparing to MadGraph. The top-quark background modelling is studied in the dedicated one lepton control region, and in a two lepton control region using e\u03bc pairs. Both the p T and mass of the two small-R jet system are studied. A systematic uncertainty is derived based on the data/simulation comparison in these regions. for W /Z + l, 30% for W /Z + cl and a 30% uncertainty is applied to the relative normalisation between W /Z + bc/bl/cc to W /Z + bb. In addition, the following normalisation uncertainties are assigned to the background processes: 4% for single-top in the s-and t-channels, 7% for single-top in the W t-channel [85,86], and 50% for associated (W /Z )h [77,87] production. The sources of uncertainty considered for the cross-sections for the diboson production (W W , W Z and Z Z ) are the renormalisation and factorisation scales, the choice of PDFs and parton-shower and hadronisation model. The multijet contribution is estimated from data and is assigned a 50% uncertainty. Uncertainties arising from the size of the simulated event sample are also taken into account.",

The normalisations of the major backgrounds are constrained by the data in both the signal and control regions. The shapes of the background distributions are taken from Monte Carlo simulations but can be modified within the systematic errors listed in Section 7. The spectra entering the fit are those from the three selections associated with the number of leptons with each of these regions divided into three categories based on the number of b-tags and four kinematic regions. In the zero-lepton region, this division is based on E miss T while in the one-and two-lepton regions, it is based on p T (\u03bc, E miss T ) and p T ( , ), respectively. The shape information is not used in the zero-b-tag distributions in order to simplify the fit. This division is designed to isolate, and more effectively constrain, different backgrounds. In particular, the is the signal yield, while all parameters describing the systematic uncertainties and their correlations are included in the likelihood function as nuisance parameters, with Gaussian constraints, implemented using the framework described in Refs. [88,89]. The nuisance parameters with the largest effect on the determination of the parameter of interest are the flavour-tagging and jet systematic uncertainties, together with the normalisation of the tt and W +bb backgrounds. The reconstructed Higgs boson candidate mass distribution is shown in Fig. 2 in each of the E miss T categories for the set of events with two b-tags with the integrated event yields shown in Table 2. Furthermore, shown in Fig. 3 is the E miss T distribution in the signal region, noting that in the two portions of the spectrum, below and above E miss T = 500 GeV, the requirements on the hadronic activity are taken from the small-R and large-R jets, respectively. No significant excess of events is observed above the background, with the global significance of the deviation of the data from the background-only prediction being 0.056.",
