A large litterature is now devoted to possible modifications of the laws of gravitation : in general, these modifications are equivalent to the introduction of new fields in addition to the metric tensor g \u00b5\u03bd . Another approch is to assume that dark matter is constituted of a gaz of collisionless, stable and massive particles whose nature is still unknown. Indeed several arguments strongly suggest that the Standard Model of particle physics is not complete, at least for energies larger than the electroweak scale. A large number of extensions of the Standard Model provide quite naturally a possible dark matter candidate in their spectrum [1].",

First, the truncated maxwellian model for the velocity distribution is a simple approximation, with two free parameters (its velocity dispersion related to the circular velocity at solar radius, and the escape velocity). The presence of streams could change the function f 1 (v). Second, the local value of dark matter density is infered from measurements of the Milky Way rotation curve and a modelization of its different components. While the canonical value is \u03c1 0 = 0.3 GeV/cm 3 , there is certainly an uncertainty of a factor 2 or 3 (see for example [7]).

The absorber is a Germanium (or Silicium) cristal of typical mass 400 g nowadays, cooled down to 20 mK or 40 mK. Electrodes cover the cristal, and a voltage of order a few volts is applied in order to collect the ionization signals. No more than a few volts may be applied due to the low temperature. Also, with large voltages, the heat channel would only measure the Joule effect associated to charge drift, and would not add any information complementary to the ionization channel. The ionization yield measurement results in a remarkable discrimination of \u03b3-ray induced interactions within the absorber. An issue with these detectors comes with surface interaction discrimination: when an interaction takes place close to the electrode surface, the charge collection mechanism cannot be fully completed, resulting in a loss of ionization signal. A surface electronic recoil may therefore mimic a bulk nuclear recoil. A source of such surface events is the \u03b2 radioactivity due to 210 Pb, which is a daughter element of radon. The ubiquity of radon in the air, together with the 22 year lifetime of 210 Pb, make it difficult to reduce the presence of this background. Typical surface \u03b2 rates of a few events/kg/day are observed. These events of radioactive origin have limited EDELWEISS sensitivity to WIMP-nucleon cross-sections of \u223c 10 \u22126 pb in 2003 [17].",

The vessel is instrumented with an array of detectors, typically photomultipliers. A strong, vertical electric field of order 1 kV/cm is applied within the whole volume. An interaction within the liquid phase generates a first direct scintillation signal, called S1. Depending on the ionizing power of the incoming particle, free electrons are created and drift vertically until they reach the gaz phase. When crossing the boundary between the two phases, a second light S2 is emitted due to the difference of amplitude of the electric fields in both phases. From the different signals of the PMT array, and their relative timings, the position of the primary interaction may be reconstructed. Furthermore, since the ionization yield is smaller for nuclear recoils, the S2/S1 ratio is used as a discriminating parameter between electronic and nuclear recoils.",

The Xenon was kept at 180 K and 2.2 atm with a specifically developped pulse tube cryocooler. Calibrations show that the populations of electronic and nuclear recoil are not completely separated by the discriminating variable based on S2/S1: they overlap partly, therefore to reject most of the \u03b3 background one must also reject \u223c 50% of nuclear recoils, resulting in a \u223c 50% WIMP search efficiency loss. A 5.4 kg fiducial volume was defined in the bulk of the TPC using the event position reconstruction. Since most of the radioactivity comes from surfaces (in particular PMTs), this allows an efficient self-shielding against the \u03b3 background. In 2007 a WIMP search was accomplished using 136 kg.days of effective exposure in the energy range 4.5 < E r < 27 keV. Some background remained present especially for E r > 15 keV. These \"anomalous\" events are probably due to double interactions taking place in the detector, among which one takes place in a dead region of the liquid Xenon and generates S1 but no S2 signal. A limit on \u03c3 SI of 4.4 \u00d7 10 \u22128 pb for M \u03c7 = 30 GeV was obtained, which is still the best published sensitivity for WIMPs with masses below 44 GeV. An important systematic uncertainty on this sensitivity is the exact value of liquid Xenon scintillation yield for low energy nuclear recoil [25].

Both technologies require heavy cryogenic set-ups, the cryogeny for Ge bolometers being even more imposing for an equivalent target mass due to the necessity to cool-down massive targets at 20-40 mK. The definition of a fiducial volume may now be done for both noble liquids and bolometers. For noble liquids, the self-shielding effect will be more and more efficient as the instrumented mass grows. For bolometers, since the individual bolometer mass will be limited for heat capacitance reasons, the detector segmentation will be important. The electronic recoil vs nuclear recoil discrimination is much less efficient for Xenon detectors than for bolometers. This is less the case for Argon TPCs, but current Argon detectors must face a stronger internal \u03b3-ray background. While it seems that going to larger-mass detectors will be easier with noble liquid detectors, there is a real complementarity between these techniques which would allow for an efficient cross-check in case of detection of a WIMP signal.",

As explained above, these detectors do not provide an event-by-event discrimination of the gamma background, but both the high exposure achieved (3400 kg.days) and the use of a statistical pulse-shape discrimination using the falltime of signals enabled to reach a sensitivity of \u223c 0.2 pb for \u03c3 SD p . \u2022 The superheated droplet technique, used by the PICASSO [32] and COUPP [33] experiments currently provides the best sensitivity to a p at low WIMP mass. The 19 F is used as a target in, for example, liquid CF 3 I for COUPP. In appropriate temperature and pressure conditions, the interaction of a particle in the detector creates a bubble in the target volume, only for nuclear recoils.

At a given recoil energy, the interaction rate is sinusoidally modulated. The amplitude of the modulation depends on the recoil energy and is typically \u223c 7%. The observation of such a modulation in a nuclear recoil spectrum therefore constitutes one more test of the WIMP hypothesis. Since the modulation is weak, a high statistics of WIMP-induced nuclear recoils as well as a good control of long-term detector stability are required in order to perform such a test. Since 1996, the DAMA experiment uses NaI(Tl) solid scintillators in order to search for such a modulation. With these cristals, an exceptionnally high exposure of 0.82 ton.year could be collected, using first 100 kg during 7 years, and then 250 kg during 4 years in the DAMA/LIBRA setup [36,37]. As explained above, the \u03b3ray background cannot be rejected on an event-by-event basis in these scintillators, and actually the DAMA collaboration does not perform any pulse shape rejection of electronic recoils in its annual modulation search. Therefore an integral spectrum, including radioactivity backgrounds as well as possible WIMP interactions, is observed, and an annual modulation signal is searched for in this spectrum for energies E > 2 keV. The combination of all DAMA/NaI and DAMA/LIBRA data shows a statistically compelling (8 \u03c3) modulation signal at low energies, for 2 E 4 keV.

In particular, the modulated signal is near 3 keV, an energy where a peak at 3.2 keV associated to 40 K dominates the radioactivity background, and where the detector efficiency drops sharply, opening the way to several possible systematic effects. The KIMS experiment (see section 6.1), now also searching for an annual modulation in a different underground laboratory and with different cristals (CsI), could provide a possible direct cross-check of the modulation signal. From a phenomenological point of view, the DAMA signal is merely compatible with other searches, both in the spin-independent and spin-dependent channels. An interpretation of DAMA signal as due to a spin-dependent WIMP-proton coupling is now severely constrained by KIMS, COUPP and PICASSO. All currently competitive bolometric and noble liquid searches exclude the DAMA signal in the hypothesis of a purely spin-independent coupling, except for very-low mass WIMPs M \u03c7 < 10 GeV. In this low-mass range, the CoGeNT experiment (see section 3) could put constraints on the DAMA signal, but a \"window\" remains clearly open, mostly due to the uncertainties on detector properties (such as a hypothetical channeling effect in NaI cristals) and on astrophysical parameters (especially the local WIMP velocity distribution).",
