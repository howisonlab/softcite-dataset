We present an analysis based on the 2010 and part of the 2011 data sets from the ICARUS experiment, located at Gran Sasso National Laboratory and using the same neutrino beam from CERN. We find that the rates and deposited energy distributions of neutrino events in ICARUS agree with the expectations for an unperturbed spectrum of the CERN neutrino beam, as also reported by OPERA. Our results therefore refute a superluminal interpretation of the OPERA result according to the Cohen and Glashow (2011) prediction [2] for a weak current analog to Cherenkov radiation. In a dedicated search, no superluminal Cherenkov-like e + e \u2212 pair or \u03b3 emission event has been directly observed inside the fiducial volume of the \"bubble chamber-like\"",

Indeed at \u03b4 = 5 \u2022 10 \u22125 essentially no E \u03bd > 30 GeV should arrive from CERN to LNGS, while our results are indicating no visible deviation of the incoming neutrino beam with respect to the expected rate and energy distribution.

(1), (3)) generated by the passing superluminal neutrinos. These events would be characterised either by a single gamma ray converting into an e + e \u2212 pair (Eq. (1)) and/or two single electrons (Eq. (3)) both with no hadronic recoils in the incoming neutrino direction. The transverse momenta of the particles in the events (1) and 3, as determined by the centre of mass system, are however far too small to be experimentally observable. Therefore events of both types ((1) and (3)) would appear as narrow e + e \u2212 pairs pointing directly to the beam direction, with no detectable hadronic activity. The rate of such events for the ICARUS detector exposure under consideration (6.70 \u2022 10 21 t \u2022 pot) can be derived from those presented in Fig. 3. With the OPERA result (\u03b4 \u2248 5 \u2022 10 \u22125 ) more than 7 \u2022 10 6 electron-positron pairs should have been observed for this exposure, each with an energy spectrum peaked around 10 GeV (see Fig. 2). This number should not be a surprise since the CC neutrino event rates of the 2010 and the 2011 ICARUS samples with average energy of \u2248 28 GeV represents a total of 2.1 \u2022 10 12 neutrinos passing through the detector. Candidate pair bremsstrahlung events have been searched for requiring the absence of any hadronic activity, the presence of a single electromagnetic shower with vertex internal to the fiducial volume, energy deposition of at least 200 MeV, and direction pointing towards the beam axis within 150 mrad (a loose cut compared with the pair emission angle). No event survived all these cuts. A further selection, the request for a double ionisation initial track, has never been used, since no candidate survived the other cuts. Only two events were considered as candidates after a first screening. The former was discarded since the shower is directed at 60 degrees with respect to the beam, and is starting from one corner of the fiducial volume. In the latter case, a careful investigation of the shower revealed the existence of two distinct photons.",

The resulting neutrino spectra and rates for \u03b4 \u2248 5 \u2022 10 \u22125 as suggested by OPERA are significantly different from the unaffected ones.
