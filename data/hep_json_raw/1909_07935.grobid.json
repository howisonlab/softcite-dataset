In particular, the mode of the gauge boson virtuality is shifted with respect to the pole due to the dependence of the partonic luminosity on the boson virtuality. The knowledge of this shift contributes to the systematic uncertainty for a direct measurement of the boson mass. A detailed study of the shift and of its systematic uncertainty due to the limited knowledge of the PDFs is obtained using a tree-level model of Z and W boson production in protonproton collisions at \u221a s = 13 TeV. A Monte Carlo simulation is further used to validate the tree-level model and study the dependence of the shift on the transverse momentum of the gauge bosons. The tree-level calculation is found to provide a good description of the shift. The systematic uncertainty on the lineshape due to the PDFs is estimated to be below one MeV in the phase-space relevant for a future high-precision mass measurement of the gauge boson masses at the LHC.",

First, protonproton collisions at a center-of-mass-energy \u221a s result in partonic f f collisions with a broad distribution of partonic center-of-mass-energies \u221a\u015d = \u221a x 1 x 2 s, where x 1 and x 2 are the fractions of the proton momentum carried by the interacting partons, as described in the empirical parton density functions (PDFs). The center of mass of the initial state is unknown and changes on an event by event basis covering all relevant energies. The lineshape of the boson can be measured using the decay product kinematics, like the invariant mass of the \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 pairs in Z decays.",

The ATLAS and CMS experiments already collected about of 400 million W and 40 million Z bosons each during the Run 2 of the LHC. By the end of Run 3, 10 8 Z leptonic decays will be available and a factor of 10 more at the end of the High Luminosity LHC program. These numbers must be compared to the 10 million Z bosons produced at LEP in all decay channels. This unprecedented number of W and Z bosons produced at the LHC offers new opportunities for precise measurements, but it also forces consideration of sources of systematic uncertainty which may have been neglected so far, for example those related to the modeling of the virtuality of the gauge bosons [2]. For instance, by analyzing the dileptonic Z decays of Run 3 of the LHC a statistical-only precision of about 10 \u22125 GeV on M Z might be achievable. This level of precision would demand a control of the dilepton mass lineshape at the sub-MeV level.",

[6]. The latter is a function of the dimensionless parameter \u03c4 = Q 2 /s. The non-trivial dependence of the partonic luminosity on \u03c4 implies a distortion of the lineshape compared to a pure Breit-Wigner. Given the narrowness of the electroweak gauge boson width \u0393 V , this effect can be treated, in first approximation, as a shift \u0394 V of the mode of the distribution compared to M V . The limited knowledge of the PDFs introduces an uncertainty on \u0394 V , which contributes directly to the model uncertainty in the extraction of M V from the dilepton mass distribution.",

However, this is mostly of academic interest since the invariant mass of the leptonic final state cannot be measured in W decays due to the presence of the neutrino. The traditional measurement of the W mass at hadron colliders uses non-Lorentz invariant quantities (e.g. the transverse mass or the lepton transverse momentum) whose distributions have a dependence on the PDFs which induces a systematic uncertainty much larger than the effect discussed in this paper [7]. However, the larger than ever number of W decays collected by the LHC opens up possibilities for novel measurements that might be less sensitive to the PDFs [8,9]. Likewise, the increased coverage in rapidity planned by the upgrades of the LHC experiments may have a strong impact in reducing the aforementioned PDF uncertainty [10,11]. For the above reasons, the results of this paper may become relevant also for a future W mass measurement at LHC. This paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2 a tree-level calculation of the shift \u0394 V is presented. In Sect. 3, a Monte Carlo (MC) simulation of Drell-Yan production is used to validate the tree-level model and extend the study to the full phase-space. The results are summarized in Sect. 4.",

This approximation amounts to considering just one Feynman diagram per quark-antiquark pair, as illustrated in Fig. 1a. Besides accounting already for the bulk of the total cross section (about 80% for a 20 GeV threshold on the transverse momentum of the extra parton at \u221a s = 13 TeV), these dia- grams are also expected to be the most sensitive to the PDFdependent shift under study. Indeed, they are the only 2 \u2192 1 diagrams contributing to the amplitude, whereas higher-order diagrams are at least 2 \u2192 2, see e.g. Fig. 1b. As such, they include additional invariants besides Q. The existence of these extra scales is expected to dilute the sensitivity of the lineshape to the details of the PDFs. This assumption will be validated by a MC analysis of pp \u2192 V + X production discussed in Sect. 3. In the following, the NNPDF3.0 [12] PDF set will be used to evaluate the PDFs relevant for W and Z production in proton-proton collisions at \u221a s = 13 TeV.

Given the similarity between neutral-and charged-current Drell-Yan production, and the observation that W boson production, split by charge, can serve as a good proxy also for the Z boson (see Fig. 2), and given the much larger MC sample available, the analysis has been restricted hereafter to the special case V = W \u00b1 About 8\u00d710 7 events in the final state W \u00b1 \u2192 \u03bc \u00b1 \u03bd \u03bc have been generated using the MG5_aMC@NLO [15] program interfaced with Pythia8 [16].

The MC simulation is NLO accurate for observables inclusive in additional QCD radiation and it assumes M MC W = 80.419 GeV and \u0393 MC W = 2.047 GeV.

As a further validation of this choice, two alternative instances of the parametric family of functions in Eq. 9 has been considered.

This function is formally incorrect to model the dilepton mass distribution since it does not account for the Jacobian factor proportional to Q.

The second alternative function is obtained by choosing \u03b1 = 1 and H = K = 0. This function, which will be referred to as Breit-Wigner with Jacobian, would be correct in the absence of the PDF distortion to the Q distribution.

The first analysis is inclusive in the phasespace of the boson and allows us to benchmark the different fit functions with the largest possible statistical precision. The second analysis is differential in the boson rapidity and is expected to reproduce, at least qualitatively, the ydependence from the tree-level model, as shown in Fig. 2. However, the comparison can only be approximate, since the latter predicts the transverse momentum q T to be identically zero, whereas the MC simulation generates a physical spectrum of transverse momenta. The third analysis is performed in bins of q T , and is inclusive in y. It allows us to both validate the tree-level calculation of Sect. 2 by extrapolating to q T \u2192 0, and to study the dilution effect at larger values of q T . The fit parameters of Eq. 9 are determined by minimizing a \u03c7 2 constructed using the event counts in each bin of the histogram in the range [79, 82] GeV and the value of the fit function at the center of the bin. Figure 3 shows the result of the three functional fits for the inclusive analysis for the W + sample. The W \u2212 sample shows very similar results for both the inclusive and the differential analyses, which are thus omitted for brevity. The quality of the fit improves dramatically when using the modified Breit-Wigner, with a reduced \u03c7 2 of about 1.0 compared to 1.6 and 3.9 for the alternative functions. The best-fit value of M W when using the baseline function is consistent with the MC input within 1\u03c3 (1 \u00b1 1 MeV), whereas the alternative functions depart from it by \u22129.9 \u00b1 0.4 MeV and \u221221.5 \u00b1 0.4 MeV, respectively. Likewise, the best-fit value of \u0393 W is consistent with the MC input values within 1.5\u03c3 (8 \u00b1 5 MeV) for the baseline function, while it departs from it by 18 \u00b1 1 MeV and 16 \u00b1 1 MeV for the alternative functions. The residual discrepancy on \u0393 W when using the modified Breit-Wigner is ascribed to higher order terms in the power expansion, not included in Eq. 9. In order to validate this assumption, a toy MC has been used to verify that such a discrepancy is indeed consistent with the neglected terms that mostly enter through the tails of the distribution, whereas M, H and K are seen to be robust.",

Given the narrow width of the electroweak gauge bosons, the PDF impact can be treated, to a first approximation, as a shift \u0394 V of the mode of the dilepton mass spectrum from the boson mass M V . The origin of such shift can be traced back to the dependence of the partonic luminosity on the virtuality Q of the gauge boson. This effect is particular important for a possible future precise measurement of the Z boson mass since it directly affects the extraction of M V from the kinematics of the dilepton final state. It has been first studied analytically by using a tree-level model of Drell-Yan production and then validated by a statistical analysis of a MC simulated sample. The tree-level calculation agrees reasonably (a) (b) Fig. 5 The shift \u0394 W \u00b1 in bins of the W boson rapidity y (left) and transverse momentum q T (right). For the latter, a linear fit in the range [0, 40] MeV is performed to extrapolate the result to q T \u2192 0.",
