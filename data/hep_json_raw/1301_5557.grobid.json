This is so as the electromagnetic field of the nucleus enhances the intensity of the virtual photon flux. Note that the number of photons scales like Z 2 , where Z is the nucleus charge. The virtuality of the photon is 1/R \u223c 30 MeV/c, where R is the radius of the nucleus.",

            "text": "In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in ultra-peripheral collisions for various colliding systems at different energies. In particular, exclusive vector meson production in heavy-ion reactions is expected to probe the nuclear gluon density [4,5], for which their is considerable uncertainty at low values of Bjorken-x. At the forward rapidities studied here, the relevant values of x are \u223c10 \u22122 and \u223c10 \u22125 . Note that either nucleus can serve as photon emitter or photon target. Exclusive J/\u03c8 production has been recently measured in Au-Au collisions at RHIC [6]. However, their measurement suffered from very low statistics. Hence, no conclusions concerning nuclear shadowing were made. This paper will focus on the first LHC measurement on exclusive photoproduction of J/\u03c8 vector mesons produced in Pb-Pb collisions at \u221a s NN = 2.76 TeV [1]. This paper begins by describing the experimental apparatus and the collected data, it will then go on to discuss the analysis steps and the way the coherent J/\u03c8 cross section was obtained. This paper will also mention how J/\u03c8 photoproduction is treated by several theoretical models, as well as giving the comparison of the measured cross section to the available predictions. Finally, a summary will be given.",

            "text": "This analysis was carried out on a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 55 \u00b5b \u22121 collected during the 2011 Pb running. A dedicated UPC trigger was active to select dimuons in an otherwise empty detector, both from \u03b3\u03b3 and from J/\u03c8 decays. It demanded the following event characteristics: (i) a single muon trigger above a 1 GeV/c p T -threshold; (ii) at least one hit in the VZERO-C detector, and (iii) no hits in VZERO-A. A detailed description of the event selection can be found in [1]. Standard cuts to ensure a good muon selection were required [8], followed by other cuts to suppress the remaining hadronic background. In particular, the VZERO offline timing was required to be compatible with crossing beams, and only events with a neutron ZDC signal below 6 TeV were kept. This cut does not remove any events with a J/\u03c8 produced with a transverse momentum below 0.3 GeV/c, but reduces hadronic contamination at higher p T . This analysis deals with exclusive reactions, i.e. Pb+Pb \u2192 Pb+Pb + J/\u03c8. For this reason, only events with exactly two oppositely charged muons were selected. After applying these selections, the J/\u03c8 yield was described as the sum of four physics processes: coherent and incoherent J/\u03c8 photoproduction, \u03b3\u03b3 continuum, and J/\u03c8 candidates from the \u03c8 \u2032 decay. Coherent J/\u03c8 candidates are those where the photon couples coherently to all nucleons in the reaction (target nucleus normally does not break up). On the other hand, incoherent J/\u03c8 photoproduction occurs when the photon couples to a single nucleon, i.e. the quasi-elastic scattering off a single nucleon. In this ",

            "text": "case, the target nucleus normally breaks up, but except from single nucleons or nuclear fragments in the very forward region no other particles are produced. In both cases the J/\u03c8 p T is very low; the expected average transverse momentum is about 60 MeV/c and 500 MeV/c for coherent and incoherent photoproduction, respectively. Figure 1 shows the dimuon p T distribution integrated over 2.8 < M inv < 3.4 GeV/c 2 . The clear peak at low p T is due to coherent interactions, while the tail extending out to 0.8 GeV/c comes from incoherent production. Taking also into account the finite detector resolution, dimuons where required to have p T < 0.3 GeV/c, resulting in 117 J/\u03c8 candidates. By performing a fit to the corresponding dimuon invariant mass spectrum, the extracted number of J/\u03c8 is N yield = 96 \u00b1 12 (stat) \u00b1 6 (syst). To perform the fit, a maximum likelihood method on the set of events satisfying the selections described was used, considering a Crystal Ball function to describe the signal and an exponential to account for the underlying continuum. The exponential slope parameter of the \u03b3\u03b3 continuum is -1.4 \u00b1 0.2 GeV \u22121 c 2 in good agreement with the corresponding Monte Carlo expectation (-1.39 \u00b1 0.01 GeV \u22121 c 2 ). This indicates the absence of hadronic background in the kinematic regions considered. The estimated feed-down contribution from the \u03c8 \u2032 decay is 11 \u00b1 6% for dimuon p T < 0.3 GeV/c, while the corresponding incoherent contribution is 12 +14 \u22124 %. The QED continuum pair production was used for normalisation purposes. Although in principle it can be calculated with high accuracy, the fact that the photon coupling to the nuclei is Z \u221a \u03b1 (with Z =82 here) rather than just \u221a \u03b1 increases the uncertainty from higher order terms. There is also an uncertainty associated with the minimum momentum transfer and the nuclear form factor. For these reasons, the uncertainty in the STARLIGHT two-photon cross section was estimated to be 20% [1]. The other sources of systematic errors are given in [1]. The differential coherent J/\u03c8 cross section is d\u03c3 coh J/\u03c8 /dy = 1.00 \u00b1 0.16(stat) +0.24 \u22120.26 (syst) mb. Figure 2 shows the comparison between the measured cross section and various models that calculate the photon spectrum in impact parameter space in order to exclude interactions where the nuclei interact hadronically. They differ mainly by the way in which the photonuclear interaction is treated. They can be grouped into three different categories: i) those that include no nuclear effects (AB-MSTW08) [10]. Here all nucleons contribute to the scattering, and the forward scattering differential cross section scales with the number of nucleons squared; ii) those that use a Glauber approach to calculate the number of nucleons contributing to the scattering (STARLIGHT [9, 11], GM [12] and CSS [13]); and those from partonic models, where the cross section is proportional to the nuclear gluon distribution squared (AB-EPS08 [12], AB-EPS09 [12], AB-HKN07 [12] and RSZ-LTA [14]). As expected, the sensitivity to shadowing at forward rapidities is reduced compared to that at mid-rapidity. At forward rapidities there is a two-fold ambiguity in the photon energy and the momentum transfer from the nucleus acting as a photon target. The AB-MSTW08 and STARLIGHT predictions deviate by about three standard deviations, if the statistical and systematic errors are added in quadrature. The RSZ-LTA, AB-EPS08 and AB-EPS09 models show the best agreement to data within one standard deviation. In addition, Figure 3 shows the ratio of the cross sections in two rapidity intervals, R = \u03c3 (\u22123.1 < y < \u22122.6)/\u03c3 (\u22123.6 < y < \u22123.1) = 1.36 \u00b1 0.36(stat) \u00b1 0.19 (syst). Here, only AB-MSTW08 and AB-HKN07 deviate by more than one standard deviation. Taken together, these results indicate that the AB-MSTW08 model is strongly disfavoured, while the predicted STARLIGHT cross section deviates by nearly three standard deviations. Best agreement is found with models that include nuclear gluon shadowing, in agreement with EPS08 or EPS09 parameterisations [15]. The findings of this first UPC study also suggest that in the future other heavier particles like the \u03d2(1S) or even the Higgs boson could be measured when using the LHC as a \"photon collider\".",
