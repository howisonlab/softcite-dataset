Candidate events for the leptonic decay mode ZZ \u2192 2l2\u03bd, where l denotes an electron or a muon, are reconstructed and selected from data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 5.1 (19.6) fb \u22121 at 7 (8) TeV collected with the CMS experiment. The measured cross sections, \u03c3 (pp \u2192 ZZ) = 5.1 +1.5 \u22121.4 (stat) +1.4 \u22121.1 (syst) \u00b1 0.1 (lumi) pb at 7 TeV, and 7.2 +0.8   \u22120.8 (stat) +1.9 \u22121.5 (syst) \u00b1 0.2 (lumi) pb at 8 TeV, are in good agreement with the standard model predictions with next-to-leading-order accuracy. The selected data are analyzed to search for anomalous triple gauge couplings involving the ZZ final state. In the absence of any deviation from the standard model predictions, limits are set on the relevant parameters. These limits are then combined with the previously published CMS results for ZZ in 4l final states, yielding the most stringent constraints on the anomalous couplings.",

The measurement of the cross section and properties of this process probe the self-interaction of electroweak gauge bosons. The ZZ final state is also an important background in searches for other interesting processes beyond the SM, such as the production of high-mass Higgs bosons and their subsequent decay to pairs of bosons [1] or supersymmetry [2]. Because of the non-Abelian structure of the electroweak gauge theory, vector bosons can interact among themselves and can couple in triplets (e.g. WWZ) or quartets (e.g. WWZZ). All couplings involving only bosons without electric charge are expected to be null at tree level, leading to the absence of triple gauge couplings for Z\u03b3 \u03b3 , ZZ\u03b3 , and ZZZ. An enhancement in the measured rate of ZZ production compared to the expectation from the SM could indicate the existence of anomalous boson couplings.",

            "text": "At tree level, ZZ pairs are primarily produced in the SM via the t-and u-channels, following the annihilation of a quark-antiquark pair in proton-proton collisions. Because of the high gluon-gluon parton luminosity, the gg \u2192 ZZ contribution has to be included. The production cross section calculated up to next-to-leading-order (NLO) accuracy in strong coupling constant (\u03b1 S ) is expected to be 6.46 +0.30 \u22120.21 (7.92 +0.37 \u22120.24 ) pb at 7 (8) TeV [3], where the uncertainties refer only to the missing higher orders in the computation. These cross sections include a leading-order (LO) computation of the gg \u2192 ZZ contribution, which is formally a next-tonext-to-leading-order (NNLO) correction. Recently, complete NNLO cross sections for ZZ production accompanied by jets have also been computed [4], leading to a further small increase in cross section compared to Ref. [3]. However, higher-order QCD corrections have been shown to be reduced significantly when vetoing events where the diboson system is produced in association with jets [5,6], as done in the present analysis. The NNLO QCD corrections apart from the LO gg \u2192 ZZ contribution are thus neglected in our simulations and in the reference cross sections to which our measurements are compared. Complete one-loop electroweak (EW) corrections to massive vector boson pair production [7,8] have also been published. The consequences of the EW corrections for ZZ production are that the transverse momentum ( p T ) spectrum of the Z bosons falls more rapidly and, in addition, the overall cross section decreases by about 4 % at LHC center-of-mass energies.",

For this reason, the 2l2\u03bd channel has a sensitivity comparable to that of the 4l channel to ATGC. The characteristic signature is an overall imbalance in the transverse momentum of the event between the initial and the final states, which consequently appears as missing transverse energy (E miss T ) in the final state. Although the branching fraction is large, this channel is rather challenging due to the large contamination from background processes, in particular the Drell-Yan (DY) process, which has a cross section nearly five orders of magnitude larger than the signal. If the Z boson or the hadrons recoiling against it are not reconstructed correctly, then an apparent E miss T results and these events can resemble the signal. Other important sources of background are diboson processes, WW and WZ, with fully leptonic decays, and tt production.",

Given that the simulation may not fully reproduce detector and pileup effects on the reduced E miss T distribution, especially in the tails, and that the simulation is limited in statistical precision, we build a model of DY background from control samples in data. For this purpose we use a process that has similar jet multiplicity, underlying event, and pileup conditions as the DY process for the region of interest at high boson p T : the production of prompt isolated photons in association with jets (\u03b3 + jets) [29]. We expect that an accurate description of the E miss T distribution and other related kinematic variables can be obtained from this photon + jets sample. However, some corrections must be applied to the photon + jets sample to ensure a good modeling of the DY process. The yield of photon events is scaled to the observed charged dilepton system yield as a function of the boson p T after applying the jet veto to both samples. This accounts for the differences in the selection efficiency of the dilepton and photon candidates and corrects for the trigger prescales, which are applied to the lowp T photon triggers.",

A good agreement is found in the region dominated by the DY process, up to about 80 GeV, while the higher part of the spectrum is dominated by diboson production. The error bands shown in Fig. 1 represent the statistical uncertainty in the predicted yields. A systematic uncertainty in the final DY event yield estimated with this method is computed as the relative difference between dilepton yields in data and simulation, in a control region with E miss T < 60 GeV, and it has been found to be 25 % (40 %) at 7 (8) TeV. This systematic uncertainty is not shown in Fig. 1.",

Limits on the four f V i parameters are set by comparing the data with theoretical predictions. Figure 3 shows the charged dilepton p T distribution after the full selection described in Table 1, in data and simulation, including sherpa samples with different values of the f Z 4 parameter. The contribution from the anomalous couplings enhances the highp T region of the distribution. The charged dilepton p T is thus a good observable to probe for the presence of ATGCs. The DY and nonresonant backgrounds are estimated from data as described above. The SM ZZ process is simulated here using the MadGraph sample described in Sect. 2, with NLO QCD corrections computed with mcfm and NLO EW corrections from Ref. [7]. The contribution of the ATGCs is obtained from the sherpa samples mentioned above, by subtracting the SM sherpa contribution to the charged dilepton p T , and is summed to the MadGraph ZZ distribution. The interference of the ATGC signal and the SM ZZ production is included, except for p T (Z) < 200 GeV, which has a negligible impact on the limits. The expected signal yields in each p T bin are interpolated between different values of the ATGC coupling parameters using a seconddegree polynomial, since the signal cross section depends quadratically on such parameters.",
