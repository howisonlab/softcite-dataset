The cross section ratio at t \u2032 = 0 (GeV/c) 2 in the \u03c0 \u2212 beam is R\u03c0(\u03b7 \u2032 /\u03b7) = 0.56 \u00b1 0.04 and result in mixing angle \u03c6P = (36.8 \u00b1 1.) o . For K \u2212 beam the ratio is RK (\u03b7 \u2032 /\u03b7) = 1.30 \u00b1 0.16. It was found that gluonium content in \u03b7 \u2032 is sin 2 \u03c8G = 0.15 \u00b1 0.06.
