The transfered four-momentum squared to the target nucleus, Q 2 , is reconstructed based on the kinematics of the leading proton, and differential cross sections versus Q 2 and the cross-section ratios of iron, lead and carbon to scintillator are measured for the first time in a single experiment. The measurements show a dependence on atomic number. While the quasielastic-like scattering on carbon is compatible with predictions, the trends exhibited by scattering on iron and lead favor a prediction with intranuclear rescattering of hadrons accounted for by a conventional particle cascade treatment. These measurements help discriminate between different models of both initial state nucleons and final state interactions used in the neutrino oscillation experiments.",

            "text": "Accurate neutrino cross-section measurements and modeling of nuclear effects are required for precise measurements of neutrino oscillation physics such as CPviolation and the ordering of the neutrino masses [1,2]. One of the most important channels for lower neutrino energy oscillation experiments is charged current quasielastic (CCQE) scattering, in which a neutrino exchanges a W with a neutron, producing one lepton and one proton in the final state, along with a possibly excited nucleus which typically is undetected. Experiments such as T2K and MiniBooNE use CCQE interactions as the main channel for oscillation measurements [3,4] because in principle the neutrino energy can be deduced using only the lepton kinematics and assuming a 2-body elastic scatter. Better understanding of the CCQE process as it occurs in a nuclear medium is also needed for the higher neutrino energies of NO\u03bdA [5] and the future long baseline oscillation experiments DUNE and HyperK [1,6].",

Recent experiments using heavier nuclei such as carbon, oxygen, and iron as targets have shown that our understanding of CCQE is incomplete [10][11][12][13][14][15]. Using heavier nuclei requires consideration of the role that the nuclear environment plays; the initial state neutrons are in a bound system, and the reaction products can interact on their way out of the nucleus. A variety of initial state effects have been suggested, including Fermi motion [16], effects resulting in two particles and two holes (2p2h) such as meson exchange currents [17][18][19], short range correlations [20][21][22], and long range correlations as estimated using the Random Phase Approximation (RPA) [23][24][25]. Final state interactions (FSI), where a hadron scatters on its way out of the nucleus, are modeled in a variety of implementations [26][27][28].",

The neutron's initial state affects the final-state particle kinematics, while FSI affect both kinematics and the particle content of the final state, since particles can be rescattered or absorbed in the nucleus. As a result, a sample of events with an observed lepton and nucleons in the final state may have originated via inelastic processes at production. For example, \u2206 (1232) resonance production and decay, if the pion is absorbed during FSI, leaves a QE-like final state that contains only one lepton and some number of nucleons, but no pions. In this case the neutrino energy reconstruction assuming simple two-body kinematics will be incorrect. It is important that these A-dependent nuclear effects, which impact neutrino energy reconstruction as well as signal efficiencies, be understood and modeled since future oscillation experiments will use targets that range from carbon [5] ",

Targets 1, 2 and 3 contain distinct segments of Fe and Pb planes that are 2.6 cm thick; target 3 also has a C segment which is 7.6 cm thick and target 5 has Fe and Pb segments which are 1.3 cm thick. The analysis restricts to targets with 8 scintillator planes on both sides, except target 5 which has 4 scintillator planes upstream the target. The tracker is made solely of scintillator planes. Strips in adjacent planes are rotated by 60 \u2022 from each other, which enables three-dimensional track reconstruction [34].

The CCQE scattering model uses a relativistic Fermi gas model (RFG) and dipole axial form factor with M A = 0.99 GeV. Resonant production is modeled using the Rein-Sehgal model [36], deep inelastic scattering (DIS) kinematics is modeled using 2003 Bodek-Yang model [37] and the hadron final states are modeled with Koba-Nielsen-Olsen scaling and PYTHIA [38,39]. The default GENIE simulation has been augmented to include interactions resulting in two particles and two holes (2p2h), as formulated in the Valencia model [40][41][42]. The relative strength of this 2p2h prediction has been tuned to MINERvA inclusive scattering data [43]. The RPA effect from the calculation of [24] is included for quasielastic events. Moreover, the GENIE nonresonant pion production prediction has been modified to agree with deuterium data [44]. To treat FSI, GENIE uses an effective model, in which hadronic intranuclear rescattering cross sections increase with the nuclear size according to A 2/3 scaling [45]. The final state distributions in energy and angle come from 2-body kinematics and phase space formulations. The model provides a good description of hadron-nucleus data. Comparisons are also made to predictions of NuWro event generator [46], which uses a local Fermi gas model, an intranuclear cascade of hadronic interactions in the FSI model and medium corrections [47]. Coulomb corrections are not included in the simulations [48].",

The first background consists of interactions incorrectly reconstructed in the nuclear targets that originate in the scintillator surrounding the targets. Figure 1 shows the simulated scintillator background, as well as the signal from two different nuclear targets (Target 3 and Target 5) as a function of the reconstructed vertex position along the detector longitudinal axis. Scintillator background events are less than 8% of the final sample. The level of this background has been constrained by fitting the tails of the vertex distributions in the upstream (US Plastic) and downstream (DS Plastic) regions for each target subsection separately and extracting a scale factor for the scintillator background. Background scale factors span the range from 0.95 \u00b1 0.05 (Target 5) to 1.10 \u00b1 0.05 (Target 2). The scale factors are applied to the simulated prediction of the scintillator background in the selected sample. The second background is from interactions that are not QE-like, mostly baryon resonance production, where the pion is misidentified as a proton. This background is constrained by fitting the distribution of events with E extra > 0.05 GeV shown in Fig. 2. The fit is performed in bins Q 2 p < 0.5 GeV 2 and Q 2 p > 0.5 GeV 2 of four-momentum transfer for each nucleus (C, Fe and Pb) separately. The fit varies the background normalization while keeping the signal constant, until the simulated distributions match the data distributions. Background scale factors span the range from (1.01 \u00b1 0.10) for C to (1.3\u00b10.1) for Pb. As will be elaborated, pion FSI according to some models introduces a significant A-dependence for the QE-like signal, and these same FSI could play a similar role in the background constraint samples. Separating FSI from initial state nuclear effects is challenging since only the combined effects of both are actually measured. The coplanarity \u03d5, the angle between the \u03bd-\u00b5 and \u03bd-p reaction planes, is sensitive to FSI. For a two-body interaction with a neutron at rest, \u03d5 = 180 \u2022 .",

The simulation predicts that 30% (10%) of the data is backgrounds from resonance production (deep inelastic scattering); some signal also comes from those processes, plus CCQE-like and 2p2h reactions. The width of the distribution is due to Fermi motion, inelastic scattering, and FSI. FSI broadens the distribution by changing the proton direction and by adding a non-QE component. The distribution without FSI is shown to demonstrate the effect FSI has; the no FSI distribution is too narrow and predicts too few events away from the peak at 180 degrees. The GE-NIE FSI model appears to describe the broadening for all three samples, but A-dependent discrepancies remain for \u03d5 near 180 degrees. To check the modeling of the \u03d5 distribution for background events, a set of samples of events with a reconstructed Michel electron has been examined, and good agreement is found in each.

Systematic uncertainties on d\u03c3/dQ 2 p have been assessed for detector energy response (including hadron propagation), GENIE modeling (including FSI modeling and modeling of 2p2h effects) and the NuMI flux which is obtained from comparisons of the hadron production model with data from hadron production experiment NA49 [33]. A second background constraint technique was used in which the DIS and resonant background components are floated in the fit. This result differs from the main background constraint by 10%, which we take as a systematic uncertainty. Also, we assess the uncertainties from the efficiency of the Michel electron cut, and the number of nucleons in the nuclear targets. Most uncertainties are evaluated by randomly varying the associated parameters in the simulation within uncertainties and re-extracting d\u03c3/dQ 2 p . Uncertainties in the beam flux affect the normalization of d\u03c3/dQ 2 p and are correlated across Q 2 p bins. The uncertainties on the signal neutrino interaction and FSI models affect d\u03c3/dQ 2 p primarily through the efficiency correction, and are dominated by uncertainties on the resonance production axial form factor, pion absorption, and pion inelastic scattering. The uncertainties associated with hadron propagation in the MINERvA detector are evaluated by reweighting signal and background simulation by 10%, 15%, 20% for C, Fe and Pb respectively, based on comparisons between Geant4 and measurements of \u03c0, p, n-nucleus crosssection on nuclei [52][53][54][55]. The assigned systematic uncertainties are shown in the bottom right of Fig 4. Figure 4 shows the differential cross sections d\u03c3/dQ 2 p as a function of Q 2 p for C, Fe, and Pb in data. The GENIE FSI and the NuWro FSI models (with 2p2h and RPA correction included by both generators) are compared to the data. Predictions from each of these generators without FSI are also compared to the data. As shown previously by Fig.  3, the FSI treatments are needed to achieve agreement. The data exhibits an A-dependence and better agreement with NuWro than GENIE; at higher A the protons move to lower energy, suggesting an increase in proton energy loss in the nucleus. The measurement tests the FSI treatments, especially with respect to pion absorption and proton inelastic scattering. NuWro has medium effects for pion absorption FSI that give a strong dependence on A, effects that are not included in GENIE.",

Adding the 2p2h reaction to the default GENIE model changes the predicted cross section by 20% for C, 21% for Fe, and 22% for Pb. Adding the RPA produces a 0.6% change because the most affected events are below the proton tracking threshold of this analysis. Neither the 2p2h nor the RPA model predicts significant A dependence. The chi-square between the GENIE simulation, with and without 2p2h and RPA, and the data is shown in Table I, together with the chi-square for NuWro with 2p2h plus RPA compared to the data. The Valencia 2p2h process includes one or two protons in the final state. Often one of them is trackable. When the model is compared to both the reconstructed data and the unfolded cross section, it adds 15 to 20% to the first three data points, and a little to the fourth, and is essential to describe the observed rate.   Figure 5 shows the ratios of d\u03c3 dQ 2 p on C, Fe and Pb to the same quantity as measured in the high statistics CH sample. The data ratios are helped by reduction of systematics uncertainties including the flux. The data ratios emphasize the increasingly strong effect on C, Fe and Pb. The model ratios show that a large effect can be attributed to FSI and is similar for both GENIE and NuWro. In addition, NuWro better describes the lowest Q 2 p points with its A-dependent pion absorption model and medium corrections. The coplanarity angle also shows an A dependence, which may partially be from FSI.",
