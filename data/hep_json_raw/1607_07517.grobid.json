A suppression of J /\u03c8 production, with respect to the production in p + p scaled by the number of binary nucleon-nucleon collisions, is observed in central Au +Au collisions at these three energies. No significant energy dependence of nuclear modification factors is found within uncertainties. The measured nuclear modification factors can be described by model calculations that take into account both suppression of direct J /\u03c8 production due to the color screening effect and J /\u03c8 regeneration from recombination of uncorrelated charm-anticharm quark pairs.",

            "text": "The Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) was built to investigate strongly interacting matter at high temperature and energy density in the laboratory through high-energy heavy-ion collisions. At extremely high temperatures and baryon densities, a transition from the hadronic phase of matter to a new deconfined partonic phase, the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP), is predicted by Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8]. It has been proposed that the color potential in quarkonia could be screened by quarks and gluons in the QGP [9]. Quarkonia are bound states of charm-anticharm (cc) or bottom-antibottom (bb) quark pairs. As a consequence, quarkonium production cross sections in heavy-ion collisions divided by the corresponding number of binary nucleon-nucleon collisions, N coll , are expected to be suppressed compared to those in p + p collisions if QGP is formed in heavy-ion collisions.",

            "text": "The J /\u03c8 is the most abundantly produced quarkonium state accessible to experiments. Over the past twenty years, J /\u03c8 suppression in hot and dense media has been a topic of growing interest. Various measurements of J /\u03c8 production in heavy ion collisions have been performed in different collision systems and at different energies, and indeed a suppression of J /\u03c8 production has been observed [10][11][12][13]  [16,17]) for mid-rapidity, even though the temperature and energy density reached in these studies are significantly different [18]. Furthermore, a stronger suppression at forward rapidity (1.2 < |y| < 2.2) compared to mid-rapidity (| y| < 0.35) was observed at RHIC [16]. These observations indicate that effects other than color screening are important for J /\u03c8 production. Among these effects, J /\u03c8 production from the recombination of cc [19,20], together with color screening effect, play important roles in explaining the similar suppressions at SPS and RHIC [21]. With the higher temperature and density at RHIC, the increased contribution due to regeneration from the larger charm quark density could compensate for the enhanced suppression. This could also explain a stronger suppression at forward rapidity at RHIC where the charm quark density is lower compared to mid-rapidity [20][21][22][23]. In addition to the color screening and regeneration effects, there are also modifications from cold nuclear matter (CNM) effects, such as nuclear parton distribution function modification [24], energy loss by the colliding nuclei [25], Cronin effect [26], and other final state effects, such as nuclear absorption [27] and dissociation by co-movers [28]. The suppression due to these effects has been systematically studied experimentally via p + A collisions [29][30][31][32][33][34][35][36][37][38][39]. However, the extrapolation from p + A to A + A is still model dependent.  [17] and 2011 and study the nuclear modification factors at these energies.",

The Vertex Position Detector (VPD) was used to select Au + Au collisions that were within \u00b115 cm of the center of the STAR detector [45]. The minimum-bias trigger utilized in this analysis required a coincidence between the East and West VPD. In order to avoid the VPD inefficiency in peripheral Au + Au collisions, only data in 0-60% central collisions are accepted. The total numbers of 0-60% central events that are used in this analysis are 182 million, 94 million, and 360 million for 39, 62.4 and 200 GeV, respectively. The J /\u03c8 is reconstructed through its decay into electron-positron pairs, J /\u03c8 \u2192 e + e \u2212 (branching ratio Br( J /\u03c8 \u2192 e + e \u2212 ) = 5.97 \u00b1 0.03% [46]). The primary detectors used in this analysis are the Time Projection Chamber (TPC)  [47], the Time-of-Flight (TOF) detector [48], and the Barrel Electromagnetic Calorimeter (BEMC) [49]. The TPC provides tracking and particle identification via the ionization energy loss ( dE/dx ) of charge particles. The TOF [48] measures the velocity of particles, which greatly improved electron identification at low momentum. This detector, combined with the TPC [47], clearly identifies electrons by rejecting hadrons in the low and intermediate momentum ",

However, in the theoretical calculation [21], the regeneration contribution increases with collision energy due to the increase in the charm pair production, and compensates the enhanced suppression arising from the higher temperature.

Suppression of J /\u03c8 production, with respect to the production in p + p scaled by the number of binary nucleonnucleon collisions, is observed at these three energies. No significant energy dependence of the nuclear modification factor (either R A A or R C P ) is found within uncertainties.

Electrons from one event are paired with positrons from other random events from an event pool with similar global features such as collision centrality and vertex position. The vertex position is divided into 20 bins and the event centrality into 10 bins to ensure that the mixing is done using tracks from similar conditions. The invariant mass distribution of e + e \u2212 pairs before and after the combinatorial background subtraction in 0-60% central Au + Au collisions are shown in Fig. 1 for \u221a s N N = 39, 62.4, and 200 GeV. The mixed-event background is normalized to the like-sign distribution in a mass range of 2.0-4.0 GeV/c 2 and the normalized shapes show close agreement. The normalization technique is described in Ref. [52]. The mass distribution of e + e \u2212 is fitted by the J /\u03c8 signal shape obtained from MC simulation, which includes the resolution of the TPC, bremsstrahlung of the daughter electrons in the detector and internal radiation of J /\u03c8 , combined with a straight line for residual background. The residual background mainly comes from the correlated open charm decays and Drell-Yan processes. The raw J /\u03c8 signal is obtained from bin counting in the mass range 2.7-3.2 GeV/c 2 after combinatorial and residual background subtraction. The fraction of J /\u03c8 counts outside of the mass window was determined from the J /\u03c8 MC simulated signal shape and was found to be \u223c9%. This was used to correct the number of J /\u03c8 counts. Signal-to-background ratios for these three energies are observed to be 0.62, 0.39, and 0.04, respectively for the transverse momentum (p T ) interval 0-3 GeV/c (39 and 62 GeV) and 0-5 GeV/c (200 GeV).

At high momentum (p > 1.5 GeV/c), a cut on the ratio of momentum to energy deposited in towers from BEMC (0.3 < pc/E < 1.5) is used to suppress hadrons.The electron and positron candidates are then identified by their specific energy loss ( dE/dx ) in the TPC.
