Events with two jets and a muon in the final state were investigated, and beauty events were identified using the muon's relative transverse momentum to a jet and its impact parameter. Visible cross sections were measured differentially in the transverse momenta of the highest energy jet (p jet1 T ) and the muon (p \u00b5 T ), the pseudorapidity of the muon (\u03b7 \u00b5 ) and of the photon's momentum fraction x obs \u03b3 entering the hard interaction. The measurements are found to be well described by QCD calculations at NLO.",

The largest discrepancies are observed for the differential measurements in the lowest bins of p \u00b5 T and p jet1 T . For these bins, the ratio between the measurements is about 2.5 \u03c3 below unity if systematic uncertainties that do not cancel between both measurements are taken into account. It has been checked that this discrepancy is not caused by differences in the analysis method between the HERA-I and HERA-II analyses; we therefore attribute the difference to a statistical fluctuation. Fig. 2e) shows the difference in azimuthal angle, \u03b4\u03c6 jets , between the two jets. In leading order QCD the two outgoing quarks must be exactly opposite in azimuthal angle, corresponding to \u03b4\u03c6 jets = 180 \u2022 . Thus, values of \u03b4\u03c6 jets substantially lower than 180 \u2022 are indicative of the presence of further final state gluons, and therefore this quantity is sensitive to the description of gluon emission. PYTHIA, which employs parton showers to simulate the effect of multiple gluon emission, describes the shape of this observable reasonably well, as does the fixed order calculation of FMNR, which allows at most one hard gluon in the final state.",
