In this analysis, we model the background-subtracted, efficiency-corrected \u03c7c1\u03c0 + mass distribution using the K\u03c0 mass distribution and the corresponding normalized K\u03c0 Legendre polynomial moments, and then test the need for the inclusion of resonant structures in the description of the \u03c7c1\u03c0 + mass distribution. No evidence is found for the Z1(4050) + and Z2(4250) + resonances, and 90% confidence level upper limits on the branching fractions are reported for the corresponding B-meson decay modes.",

All resonance activity seems confined to the K\u03c0 system. It is also observed that the angular distributions, expressed in terms of the K\u03c0 Legendre polynomial moments, show strong similarities between B \u2192 \u03c8(2S)K\u03c0 and B \u2192 J/\u03c8 K\u03c0 decays. Therefore, the angular information provided by the B \u2192 J/\u03c8 K\u03c0 decay can be used to describe the B \u2192 \u03c8(2S)K\u03c0 decay. It is also observed that a localized structure in the \u03c8(2S)\u03c0 mass spectrum would yield high angular momentum Legendre polynomial moments in the K\u03c0 system. Therefore, a good description of the \u03c8(2S)\u03c0 data using only K\u03c0 moments up to L = 5 also suggests the absence of narrow resonant structure in the \u03c8(2S)\u03c0 system.",

The BABAR detector is described in detail elsewhere [7]. Charged particles are detected and their momenta measured with a combination of a cylindrical drift chamber (DCH) and a silicon vertex tracker (SVT), both operating within the 1.5 T magnetic field of a superconducting solenoid. Information from a ring-imaging Cherenkov detector is combined with specific ionization measurements from the SVT and DCH to identify charged kaon and pion candidates. Photon energy and position are measured with a CsI(Tl) electromagnetic calorimeter (EMC), which is also used to identify electrons. The return yoke of the superconducting coil is instrumented with resistive plate chambers for the identification of muons. For the later part of the experiment the barrel-region chambers were replaced by limited streamer tubes [8].",

A better fit is obtained by including an additional incoherent spin-1 K * (1680) [2] resonance contribution.
