            "text": "Measurements of the production cross-section of electroweak bosons constitute an important test of the Standard Model at LHC energies. Theoretical predictions, which are available at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in perturbative quantum chromodynamics (QCD) [1][2][3][4][5], rely on the parameterisations of the momentum fraction, Bjorken-x, of the partons inside the proton. The uncertainties on the parton density functions (PDFs) of the proton are larger at low Bjorken-x values. The forward acceptance of the LHCb experiment, with a pseudorapidity coverage in the range 2 < \u03b7 < 5, can directly access this region of the phase space to Bjorken-x values as low as 10 \u22126 and provide constraints on the PDFs that complement those of the ATLAS and CMS experiments [6]. In addition to the determination of the W boson cross-section, the ratio of W + to W \u2212 cross-sections and the W production charge asymmetry allow the Standard Model to be tested with high precision, as experimental and theoretical uncertainties partially cancel.",

            "text": "LHCb has previously reported measurements of inclusive W and Z boson production in pp collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of \u221a s = 7 TeV to final states containing muons using a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of about 40 pb \u22121 [7]. The impact of the W results on the PDF determination was studied and determined to be the largest compared to other LHC Drell-Yan data due to the forward acceptance of the LHCb detector [8,9]. A more precise measurement of the W production can therefore further improve the knowledge of the partonic content of the proton. The analysis presented in this paper is based on a data set collected in 2011, which corresponds to an integrated luminosity of approximately 1.0 fb \u22121 . The contribution of virtual photons to Z boson production is always implied. The inclusive W + and W \u2212 cross-sections, \u03c3 W \u00b1 \u2192\u00b5 \u00b1 \u03bd , are measured for muons with a transverse momentum, p T , greater than 20 GeV/c and \u03b7 between 2.0 and 4.5. The differential cross-sections, the W + to W \u2212 cross-section ratio, R W , and the muon charge asymmetry, A \u00b5 , are determined in the same fiducial kinematic region in eight bins of muon pseudorapidity. The ATLAS [10] and CMS [11] collaborations already reported measurements of these quantities, although in different kinematic volumes. Measurements are corrected for final state radiation (FSR) of the muon. No corrections are applied for initial state radiation, electroweak effects, and their interplay with QED effects.",

The detector includes a high-precision tracking system consisting of a silicon-strip vertex detector surrounding the pp interaction region, a large-area silicon-strip detector located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4 Tm, and three stations of silicon-strip detectors and straw drift tubes placed downstream of the magnet. The magnet polarity can be reversed, so that left-right detector asymmetry effects can be studied and corrected for in the analyses. The tracking system provides a measurement of momentum, p, with a relative uncertainty that varies from 0.4% at low p values to 0.6% at 100 GeV/c. The minimum distance of a track to a primary vertex, the impact parameter (IP), is measured with a resolution of (15 + 29/p T ) \u00b5m, where the p T is in GeV/c. Different types of charged hadrons are distinguished using information from two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors. Photon, electron and hadron candidates are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic and a hadronic calorimeter. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers. The trigger consists of a hardware stage, based on information from the calorimeter and muon systems, followed by a software stage, which JHEP12(2014)079 applies full event reconstruction. A set of global event cuts that prevents events with high occupancy dominating the processing time of the software trigger is also applied.",

Good agreement is observed between pseudo-W data and W \u2192 \u00b5\u03bd simulation; however, the larger average p T of pseudo-W events must be accounted for. Simulation is used to asses the difference due to measuring the selection efficiency with muons produced in Z instead of W boson decays, which on average amounts to about 2%. The statistical uncertainty of the data-driven determination and of the simulation-based correction are summed in quadrature. The efficiency is found to vary as a function of the muon pseudorapidity. No dependence on the lepton charge is observed except for the most forward \u03b7 bin. The measured \u03b5 sel ranges between 61.9% and 70.0% in the central bins with an uncertainty of about 0.5%, but decreases to 49.0% in the first pseudorapidity bin.
