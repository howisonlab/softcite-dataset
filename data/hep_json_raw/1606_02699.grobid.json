This measurement uses events with an opposite-charge electron-muon pair in the final state. Jets containing b-quarks are tagged using an algorithm based on track impact parameters and reconstructed secondary vertices. The numbers of events with exactly one and exactly two b-tagged jets are counted and used to determine simultaneously \u03c3 tt and the efficiency to reconstruct and b-tag a jet from a top quark decay, thereby minimising the associated systematic uncertainties. The cross-section is measured to be:",

The study of its production and decay properties forms a core part of the LHC physics programme. At the LHC, top quarks are primarily produced in quark-antiquark pairs (tt), and the precise prediction of the corresponding inclusive cross-section is sensitive to the gluon parton distribution function (PDF) and the top quark mass, and presents a substantial challenge for QCD calculational techniques. Physics beyond the Standard Model may also lead to an enhancement of the tt production rate.",

Events are required to pass either a single-electron or single-muon trigger, with thresholds set to be almost fully efficient for leptons with transverse momentum p T > 25 GeV passing offline selections. Each event includes the signals from on average about 14 additional inelastic pp collisions in the same bunch crossing (known as pileup). Monte Carlo simulated event samples are used to optimise the analysis, to compare to the data, and to evaluate signal and background efficiencies and uncertainties. The samples used in the analysis are summarised in Table 1. The main tt signal and background samples were processed through the ATLAS detector simulation [21] based on GEANT4 [22]. Some of the systematic uncertainties were studied using alternative tt samples processed through a faster simulation making use of parameterised showers in the calorimeters [23]. Additional simulated pp collisions generated with Pythia8.186 [24] were overlaid to model the effects from additional collisions in the same and nearby bunch crossings. All simulated events were processed using the same reconstruction algorithms and analysis chain as the data, and small corrections were applied to lepton trigger and reconstruction efficiencies and resolutions to improve the agreement with the response observed in data.",

The primary vertex is defined as the one with the highest sum of p 2 T of tracks associated to it. Electrons are required to be isolated using requirements on the calorimeter energy in a cone of size R < 0.2 around the electron (excluding the deposit from the electron itself) divided by the electron p T , and on the sum of track p T in a variable-size cone around the electron direction (again excluding the electron track itself). The track isolation cone size is given by the smaller of R = 10 GeV/p T (e) and R = 0.2, i.e. a cone which increases in size at low p T up to a maximum of 0.2. Selection criteria, dependent on p T and \u03b7, are applied to produce a nominal efficiency of 95% for electrons from Z \u2192 ee decays with p T of 25 GeV which rises to 99% at 60 GeV. The efficiencies in tt events are smaller, due to the increased jet activity. To prevent double-counting of electron energy deposits as jets, the closest jet with R < 0.2 of a reconstructed electron is removed. Finally, if the nearest jet surviving the above selection is within R = 0.4 of the electron, the electron is discarded, to ensure it is sufficiently separated from nearby jet activity.",

Table 2 shows the number of events with one and two b-tagged jets, together with the estimates of non-tt background and their systematic uncertainties discussed below. The ratio of b-tagged events to preselected events (before b-tagging) is higher for 13 TeV than at 7 and 8 TeV due to the larger increase of the tt cross-section with \u221a s compared with the Z + jets and diboson background cross-sections. In simulation, the sample with one b-tagged jet is expected to be about 89% pure in tt events, with the dominant background originating from W t single-top production, and smaller contributions from events with misidentified leptons, Z + jets and dibosons. The sample with two b-tagged jets is expected to be about 96% pure in tt events, with W t production again being the dominant background. The distribution of the number of b-tagged jets in oppositesign e\u03bc events is shown in Fig. 1, and compared to the baseline and alternative tt and background simulation samples. The tt contribution is normalised to the theoretical tt cross-section prediction at \u221a s = 13 TeV of 832 pb. The agreement between data and simulation in the one and two b-tagged bins used for the crosssection measurement is good. However, the data has about 40% more events with three or more b-tags than the baseline simulation, indicating a mismodelling of events with tt produced in association with additional heavy-flavour jets, as discussed further in Section 6. There is also an approximately 11% excess of data over simulation for events with zero b-tagged jets which does not affect the measurement, and is compatible with the expected uncertainties in modelling W W [48] and Z + jets production. Distributions of the number of jets, the jet p T , and the electron and muon |\u03b7| and p T are shown for opposite-sign e\u03bc events with at least one b-tagged jet in Fig. 2, where the simulation is normalised to the same number of events as the data.

Simulation studies show that the samples with a same-sign e\u03bc pair and one or two b-tagged jets are dominated by events with a misidentified lepton, with rates comparable to those in the opposite-sign sample. The contributions of events with misidentified leptons are therefore estimated using the same-sign event counts in data after subtraction of the estimated prompt same-sign contributions, multiplied by the opposite-to same-sign fake-lepton ratios R j for j = 1 and 2 b-tagged jets predicted from simulation. The results are shown in Table 2 and the procedure is illustrated in Table 3, which shows the expected breakdown of same-sign event counts in terms of prompt-lepton and misidentified-lepton events, and the corresponding predictions for misidentified leptons in the opposite-sign sample with all contributions estimated from simulation. The misidentified-lepton contributions are classified into those where the electron is from a photon conversion, from the decay of a heavy-flavour hadron or from other sources (e.g. a misidentified hadron within a jet), or the muon is from a heavyflavour decay or other sources (e.g. a pion or kaon decay). The values of R j are taken to be R 1 = 1.55 \u00b1 0.50 and R 2 = 1.99 \u00b1 0.82, where the central values are taken from ratios of the total numbers Table 3 The expected numbers of events with at least one misidentified lepton in the oneand two-b-tag opposite-and same-sign e\u03bc samples, broken down into different categories as described in the text. For the same-sign samples, the contributions from wrong-sign (where the electron charge sign is misreconstructed) and rightsign prompt lepton events are also shown, and the total expected numbers of events are compared to the data. The uncertainties are due to simulation statistics, and numbers quoted as '0.0' are smaller than 0.05. of misidentified-lepton events in opposite-and same-sign samples. The uncertainties encompass the different values of R j predicted for the various sub-components of the misidentified-lepton background separately, allowing the background composition to be significantly different from that predicted by simulation, where it is dominated by electrons from photon conversions, followed by electrons and muons from the decays of heavy-flavour hadrons. A 50% uncertainty is assigned to the prompt same-sign contribution, which includes events where the charge of the electron was misidentified (denoted by wrong-sign prompt in Table 3) or right-sign with two genuine same-sign leptons (e.g. from ttW /Z production). The largest uncertainties in the misidentified-lepton background come from the uncertainties in R j . The modelling in simulation of the different components of the misidentified-lepton background is checked by studying kinematic distributions of same-sign events, as illustrated for the p T and |\u03b7| distributions of the leptons in events with at least one b-tagged jet in Fig. 3. The simulation models the shapes of the distributions well, but underestimates the number of data events with two b-tagged jets by about 40%, as shown in Table 3. This deficit in simulation is attributed to a larger rate of misidentified-lepton events in data, which increases the estimate of misidentified leptons in the opposite-sign two-b-tag sample accordingly. The modelling is also checked in same-sign control samples with relaxed isolation cuts, enhancing the contributions of heavy-flavour decays, and similar levels of agreement were found, giving confidence that Fig. 3.

            "text": "The systematic uncertainties in the extracted cross-sections, \u03c3 tt and \u03c3 fid tt , are shown in Table 4, together with their effects (where relevant) on the tt preselection efficiency e\u03bc , tagging correlation C b and reconstruction efficiency G e\u03bc . Each source of uncertainty is evaluated by repeating the cross-section extraction with all relevant input parameters simultaneously changed by \u00b11 standard deviation. Correlations between input parameters (in particular significant anti-correlations between e\u03bc and C b which contribute with opposite signs to \u03c3 tt ) are thus taken into account. The total uncertainties are calculated by adding the effects of all the individual systematic components in quadrature, assuming them to be independent. The sources of systematic uncertainty are discussed in detail below. . The prediction for e\u03bc is found to be particularly sensitive to the amount of hadronic activity near the leptons, which strongly affects the efficiency of the lepton isolation requirements described in Section 3. These isolation efficiencies are therefore measured directly from data, as discussed below, and thus no modelling uncertainty is considered for the lepton isolation. Motivated by the level of agreement for events with at least three b-tags seen in Fig. 1, an additional uncertainty in C b is determined by calculating in data and simulation the ratio R 32 of the number of events with at least three b-tagged jets to the number with at least two. The baseline simulation sample is reweighted to change the fraction of events with at least three b-jets at generator level, which effectively changes the tt plus heavy-flavour fraction and the values of both C b and R 32 . A linear relation between changes in C b and R 32 is found, and used to translate the difference between the R 32 values found in data (3.1 \u00b1 0.2%) and simulation (2.21 \u00b1 0.05%) to a shift in C b of 0.39%. This shift is treated as an additional uncertainty in C b due to the modelling of heavy-flavour production in tt events, uncorrelated to the NLO, hadronisation and radiation uncertainties discussed above. Parton distribution functions: The uncertainties in e\u03bc and C b due to limited knowledge of the proton PDFs are evaluated by reweighting simulated events produced with MadGraph5_aMC@NLO using the error sets of the NNPDF 3.0 PDF sets [50]. The eigenvectors consist of a central PDF and 100 Monte Carlo replicas, for which the root mean square was taken to calculate the uncertainty. The MadGraph5_aMC@NLO sample was produced with CT10; therefore the cross-section was corrected for the relative difference between the central prediction of CT10 and NNPDF 3.0, which is about 1%. The uncertainty using the PDF4LHC Run-2 recommendations with 100 eigenvectors [51] is very similar to that obtained with NNPDF 3.0. These uncertainties have a limited effect on the crosssection measurement due to the small number of diboson background events. Background cross-sections: The uncertainties in the W t singletop and diboson cross-sections are taken to be 5.3% [49] and 6% [52], based on the corresponding theoretical predictions.",

Small corrections are applied to the simulation to improve the agreement with the response observed in data. These corrections have associated uncertainties that are propagated to the cross-section measurement. The uncertainty in the trigger efficiency is small compared to those for electron or muon identification since most events are triggered redundantly by both leptons. The efficiency of the lepton isolation requirements was measured directly in data tt events, thus including the effects of pile-up, by relaxing the cuts alternately on electrons and muons as in Ref. [13]. The results, after the correction for the contamination from misidentified leptons estimated using the same-sign e\u03bc samples as described in Section 5, showed that the baseline Powheg + Pythia6 simulation overestimates the efficiencies of the isolation requirements by about 0.2% for both the electrons and muons. These corrections were applied to e\u03bc and the corresponding uncertainties are dominated by the subtraction of misidentified leptons. Jet-related uncertainties: Although the efficiency to reconstruct and b-tag jets from tt events is extracted from the data, uncertainties in the jet energy scale, energy resolution and reconstruction efficiency affect the backgrounds estimated from simulation and the estimate of the tagging correlation C b . They also have a small effect on e\u03bc via the lepton-jet R separation cuts. The jet energy scale is varied in simulation according to the uncertainties derived from the with misidentified leptons in the one and two b-tagged samples are derived from the statistical uncertainties in the numbers of same-sign lepton events, the systematic uncertainties in the opposite-to same-sign ratios R j , and the uncertainties in the numbers of prompt same-sign events, as discussed in detail in Section 5. Integrated luminosity: The uncertainty in the integrated luminosity is 2.1%. It is derived, following a methodology similar to that detailed in Ref. [54], from a calibration of the luminosity scale using x-y beam-separation scans performed in August 2015. The effect on the cross-section measurement is slightly larger than 2.1% because the W t single-top and diboson backgrounds are evaluated from simulation, so they are also sensitive to the assumed integrated luminosity. LHC beam energy: The LHC beam energy during the 2012 pp run was calibrated to be 0.30 \u00b1 0.66% smaller than the nominal value of 4 TeV per beam, using the revolution frequency difference of protons and lead ions during p + Pb runs in early 2013 [55]. This relative uncertainty is also applicable to the 2015 pp run. Since this calibration is compatible with the nominal centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, no correction is applied to the measured \u03c3 tt value. However, an uncertainty of 1.5%, corresponding to the expected change in \u03c3 tt for a 0.66% change in centreof-mass energy, is quoted separately for the final result. Top quark mass: Alternative tt samples generated with different m t from 170 to 177.5 GeV are used to quantify the dependence of the acceptance for tt events on the assumed m t value. The level of W t single-top background based on the change of the W t cross-section for the same mass range is also considered. The tt acceptance and background effects partially cancel, and the final dependence of the result on the assumed m t value is determined to be d\u03c3 tt /dm t = \u22120.3%/GeV. The result of the analysis is reported for a top quark mass of 172.5 GeV, and the small dependence of the cross-section on the assumed mass is not included in the total systematic uncertainty.",
