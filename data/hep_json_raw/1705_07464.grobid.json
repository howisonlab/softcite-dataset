This letter discusses experimental strategies to maximize the sensitivity of the \u00b5 \u2212 \u2212 e + conversion experiment by introducing the new requirement of the mass relation of M (A, Z \u2212 2) < M (A, Z \u2212 1), where M (A, Z) is the mass of the muon-stopping target nucleus, to eliminate the backgrounds from radiative muon capture. The sensitivity of the \u00b5 \u2212 \u2212 e + conversion is expected to be improved by four orders of magnitude in forthcoming experiments using a proper target nucleus that satisfies the mass relation. The most promising isotopes found are 40 Ca and 32 S.",

            "text": "Since lepton flavor violation was confirmed by the discovery of neutrino oscillation, interest has considerably shifted to the whole leptonic sector in terms of the search for new physics beyond the Standard Model (SM). Anomalies in the leptonic sector governed by new physics have been studied within three major phenomena: (1) lepton universality violation (LUV), (2) charged lepton flavor violation (CLFV), (3) and lepton number violation (LNV). The SM, which preserves the lepton universality, predicts that three generations of leptons behave consistently within the electroweak interaction. However, recent measurements ofB \u2192 D ( * ) l \u2212\u03bd l [1][2][3][4] and B + \u2192 K + l + l \u2212 [5] have shown non-trivial discrepancies (4\u03c3 and 2.6\u03c3, respectively) to the SM predictions, showing the possibility of LUV in new physics [6]. An interesting implication of LUV is that experimentally observable CLFV phenomena may emerge from new physics [7,8]. Although the processes of CLFV can occur by neutrino mixing in the SM, it should be noted that the rates of the SM contributions were found to be extremely small, on the order of O(10 \u221254 ) because of small neutrino masses. Therefore, CLFV processes have been investigated through the various muon decay channels: \u00b5 \u2212 \u2212 e \u2212 conversion, \u00b5 + \u2192 e + + \u03b3 decay and \u00b5 + \u2192 e + + e + + e \u2212 decay in the expectation of a discovery of new physics  [9]. The observation of LNV would provide crucial evidences on the small neutrino mass ( eV). The LNV processes, with the change of lepton number by two units (\u2206L = 2), can be mediated by Majorana neutrinos through type-1 seesaw mechanism or new particles appearing at a high energy scale (> TeV). These phenomena have been explored mostly through 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay [10], which corresponds to the LNV process in the ee sector. LNV processes in other sectors also have been searched with muon-to-positron conversion \u00b5 \u2212 + N (A, Z) \u2192 e + + N (A, Z \u2212 2) [11][12][13][14][15][16][17] and rare Kaon decays such as K + \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 + \u03c0 \u2212 [18][19][20][21], while their experimental limits are far behind that of 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay, as shown in Table.

            "text": "Nevertheless, the \u00b5 \u2212 \u2212 e + conversion is worth investigating further for two reasons: (1) The \u00b5 \u2212 \u2212 e + conversion is discoverable if the LNV process is more likely to occur in flavor off-diagonal sectors, e.g., e\u00b5 sector, as implied by recent studies [24][25][26]. Several theories beyond the SM of particle physics, such as the Majorana neutrino, the doubly charged singlet scalar model [27,28], and the left-right symmetric model [29] have been suggested as feasible theories for the \u00b5 \u2212 \u2212 e + conversion. (2) In principle, the experimental sensitivity of the \u00b5 \u2212 \u2212e + conversion can significantly increase with the future \u00b5 \u2212 \u2212 e \u2212 conversion experiments because the event signatures (e \u00b1 ) of both physics processes can be easily distinguished by the charge identification. However, in the upcoming COMET and Mu2e experiments 1 [30][31][32], which were originally designed to search for the \u00b5 \u2212 \u2212 e \u2212 conversion with the sensitivity of O(10 \u221216 ), a similar scale of the sensitivity for the \u00b5 \u2212 \u2212e + conversion can only be achievable in the case of employing a proper material for a muon-stopping target nucleus. This limitation of \u00b5 \u2212 \u2212 e + conversion sensitivity is due to the backgrounds from radiative muon capture (RMC). For example, as we will show later, the sensitivity improvement is less than a factor of ten in the case of an aluminum stopping target, which is the baseline design of the COMET and Mu2e experiments. In this study, this kind of limitation was surmounted by selecting a proper muon-stopping target nucleus, which suppresses the RMC background and improves the sensitivity by four orders of magnitude over the current limit.",

This means that the \u00b5 \u2212 \u2212 e + conversion is associated with nuclear interaction, which is represented as a nuclear matrix element in the calculation of the decay rate. Another aspect of nuclear interaction is that the nucleus in the final state after the \u00b5 \u2212 \u2212 e + conversion is divided into two cases in which a daughter nucleus stays in the ground state or enters excited states. The transition to the ground state of the daughter nucleus may not be dominating since the coherence of the nucleus, which in the \u00b5 \u2212 \u2212 e \u2212 conversion, is not expected in the \u00b5 \u2212 \u2212 e + conversion. Nevertheless, in this work, we focus on the case of the ground state since the excited states suffer more from background influence, and the momentum spectrum of signals for excited states is not understood well due to the uncertainty of nuclear physics.",

The negative pions are captured by a solenoidal magnetic field and are sent to a muon-stopping target, while most of the pions decay into muons during transport. These muons are stopped at the muon-stopping target, forming a muonic atom, and subsequently cascade down to the 1s ground state, followed either by muon decays in the 1s orbit of a muonic atom (decay-in-orbit=DIO), or by muon captures by a nucleus. A single positron emission from the \u00b5 \u2212 \u2212 e + conversion is the signature of the process. The positron is measured during the delayed time interval of the bunch period to avoid huge backgrounds by the primary beam during the prompt interval of the bunch period. For the transition to the ground state of the daughter nucleus, the signal positron is mono-energetic, and its energy (E \u00b5 \u2212 e + ) is given by",

The latter requirement is generally satisfied for most of the stable nuclei, but the number of nuclei satisfying the former is limited because the daughter nucleus of the \u00b5 \u2212 \u2212 e + conversion is usually less stable than that of RMC. However, this tendency can be reversed when even-even nuclei are used as the target material since the nucleons in the daughter nucleus of the \u00b5 \u2212 \u2212 e + conversion, which is an even-even nucleus again, can bind more tightly due to the nuclear pairing force, whereas this is not the case for RMC with the odd-odd daughter nucleus. This consideration is similar to the target selection in the 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay experiments which require the mass relations of M (A, Z) > M (A, Z + 2) and M (A, Z) < M (A, Z + 1) to enable the double beta decay, and forbid the single beta decay, respectively. Table II lists the candidate target nuclei with atomic mass \u2264 70 that satisfy the requirements. Heavier nuclei were not considered due to their shorter lifetimes of muonic atoms, leading to lower efficiencies in the finite time window of measurements, as explained in the next paragraph. In the present calculation of each energy value, B \u00b5 was obtained by assuming a point-like nucleus while this may not hold for heavier nuclei due to the larger size of the nucleus, and further corrections are required [34]. In Table II, E end RM C from Eq. (2) assumes RMC without an additional nucleon emission. RMC with nucleon emission can also generate backgrounds if its endpoint energy is higher than E \u00b5 \u2212 e + or E \u00b5 \u2212 e \u2212 . However, this process does not generate additional backgrounds in most cases because the binding energy per nucleon is around 7-9 MeV for the stable nuclei, which means that the endpoint energy is lowered by a similar amount.",

The PDF of f (E \u00b5 \u2212 e + \u2212 x), where f (x) is the standard Landau distribution, was used to fit the signal positron distribution.

For the PDF of RMC positrons, another simulation was done independently to obtain enough samples of positrons from RMC. The RMC photons of 2\u00d710 6 with the same energy range were generated inside the large size of aluminum, in which almost half of the photons decay via pair productions. The PDF of positrons from the pair production was fitted to the power function of A(E end RM C \u2212x) y , where A is the normalization constant, x is the positron energy, and y is the running parameter to be fitted. The PDF after fitting was forced to be zero above E end RM C , and convoluted by the Landau energy loss distribution f (\u2212x) of the signal positrons, assuming that the energy loss distributions of positrons from \u00b5 \u2212 \u2212e + and RMC would not be substantially different from each other.

The energy distributions of the signal and RMC were convoluted with a Gaussian detector response function with 200 keV standard deviation. To estimate the improvement of the sensitivity over the current limit, the statistical significance of the signal with a given Br(\u00b5 \u2212 \u2212 e + ) was examined using a maximum likelihood method. The systematical uncertainties were assumed to be negligible. With this assumption, Br(\u00b5 \u2212 \u2212 e + ), which has 3\u03c3 significance under the null hypothesis, was found to be 1.5 \u00d7 10 \u221213 .

Among them, LNV processes are important tools to reveal the mechanism of the neutrino mass generation. Investigation of the LNV processes mostly has been conducted through 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay experiments, but the experimental search for the \u00b5 \u2212 \u2212e + conversion can also be carried out as a complementary channel to the 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay. Since a great leap of the sensitivity of the \u00b5 \u2212 \u2212 e + conversion is expected with the future CLFV experiments, it is essential to make a full exploration of the current experimental scheme. improvement compared to the current upper limit. Another advantage of these two materials is that they will also have better sensitivities in the \u00b5 \u2212 \u2212 e \u2212 conversion measurement due to their relatively high timing efficiencies. It should be noted that the actual sensitivity would be different in the real experiment because some factors such as systematical uncertainties are not considered in this paper. However, this result can be a useful standard in the selection of the muon-stopping target material in future experiments.",
