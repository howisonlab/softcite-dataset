The first modern sequential recombination algorithms were developed for e + e \u2212 colliders operated at the Z-pole (a detailed historical account is found in Reference [1]). At the heart of the jet algorithmand crucial to the definition of jets themselves -is a criterion to define the distance between two particles. In popular algorithms used at e + e \u2212 colliders the distance combines information on the angle between the particles and the energy of (the softest of the two) particles. Sequential recombination algorithm were adapted to the environment at hadron colliders in the early 1990s. At the Large Hadron Collider the large majority of analyses is based on inclusive jet reconstruction with the antik t algorithm [2].",

The possibility of a large circular e + e \u2212 collider that can reach a center-of-mass energy of approximately 350 GeV [5] is also explored, as well as a muon collider [6].

The distance measure is thus proportional to the squared inverse of the splitting probability for one parton k into partons i and j in the soft and collinear limit. Jet reconstruction at hadron colliders presents a number of additional difficulties. The incoming beams radiate gluons that can form jets. Only a fraction of the energy of the composite projectiles is transferred in the hard parton-parton process and a hadron remnant continues to travel down the beam pipe. An important consequence is that the system formed by the reaction products is typically not at rest in the laboratory frame 1 . Clustering algorithms were adapted to meet these challenges in the 1990s. 1 For di-jet production at the LHC \u03b2 z = v z /c of the di-jet system is very close to 1 and even a massive system such as a top quark pair acquires a typical \u03b2 z = 0.5. In contrast, for processes such as e + e \u2212 \u2192 ZH(\u03b3) (Higgsstrahlung) at \u221a s = 250 GeV and e + e \u2212 \u2192 tt(\u03b3) at 500 GeV \u03b2 z is smaller than 0.1 in 95% and 90% of the events, respectively. The exception to the rule is the 2 \u2192 2 process e + e \u2212 \u2192 ff (\u03b3), with f any fermion lighter than the Z-boson, where ISR (return-to-the-Z) plays an important role.",
