The experiment has been performed using the WASA-at-COSY installation, located at the COSY accelerator of the Forschungszentrum J\u00fclich, Germany. In total 3 \u00d7 10 7 events of the reaction pd \u2192 3 He\u03b7 have been recorded at an excess energy of Q = 59.8 MeV. Based on this data set the C parity violating decay \u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03b3 * \u2192 \u03c0 0 e + e \u2212 via a single-photon intermediate state has been searched for, resulting in new upper limits of",

This concept particularly restricts the decay modes of mesons and, as an instance, highly suppresses \u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 0 e + e \u2212 . However, corresponding measurements of the relative branching ratio date back to the seventies of the last century and their sensitivity is limited to many orders of magnitudes above the standard model predictions. The process \u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 0 e + e \u2212 via the single-photon intermediate state \u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03b3 * would violate C parity conservation whereas a two-photon process as a physical background has an expected branching ratio not larger than 10 \u22128 according to theoretical calculations [1][2][3].",

Nevertheless, the present experimental upper limit for the branching ratio of the decay \u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 0 e + e \u2212 was obtained in 1975 with an optical spark chamber experiment and amounts only to 4.5 \u00d7 10 \u22125 (CL = 90%) [10]. To determine a more stringent upper limit for the decay channel \u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 0 e + e \u2212 , data collected with the WASA-at-COSY facility have been analyzed which also constituted the basis for studies of other \u03b7 meson decay channels already published in Ref.

The violation of the angular momentum originates from the general rule that a radiative 0 \u2192 0 transition via the emission or absorption of a real photon is strictly forbidden, as can be read in more detail in Ref. [17]. The global gauge invariance is the reason that the divergence of the electromagnetic \u03b7\u03c0 0 transition current has to vanish. This in turn implies that the on-shell limit of the \u03b7\u03c0 0 coupling to a photon has to vanish as well, since the only term that is not directly proportional to q 2 corresponds to a longitudinally polarized photon, which therefore cannot contribute to an on-shell-photon amplitude, see e.g. [18] for more details. In summary, there is no \u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03b3 on-shell contribution for the decay \u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 0 e + e \u2212 and the transition form factor for the off-shell contribution vanishes at zero virtuality, such that the single-photon pole is completely removed [19][20][21]. In Fig. 1 the invariant mass of the e + e \u2212 pair produced in the decay is plotted according to three-particle phase space (shadowed in orange) and the decay via \u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03b3 * according to the discussed model. A more detailed calculation of the model can be found in Ref. [9]. To simulate the WASA detector responses, the WASA Monte Carlo package wmc was used, which is based on geant3 [22]. The settings for the spatial, timing and energy resolution in wmc were set to agree with the resolution observed in data.",

Hence, the data were divided into ten bins in angular ranges of cos \u03d1 cms 3 He . 5 Monte Carlo simulations were fitted to data in the eight angular bins ranging from \u22121 to 0.6. The angular range 0.6 < cos \u03d1 cms 3 He \u2264 1 was excluded because of the lower energy resolution of the forward detector for these forward scattered 3 He nuclei.

Since only very few events were expected to remain in the analysis after the event selection, an optimal choice of the selection conditions is important for the best possible result. The choice of the cut conditions was performed with 40% of the generated Monte Carlo simulations, whereas the remaining Monte Carlo data sample was used later for the selection efficiency determination. Note that the relative amounts of the different reaction channels are the same for both MC samples, scaled according to the fit explained in the previous paragraph. The graphical cut for the particle identification (see Fig. 6) was chosen by optimizing the product of the number of selected e + e \u2212 pairs (N e + e \u2212 ) and the ratio of N e + e \u2212 to the number of charged pion pairs (N \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ). While this cut was chosen beforehand, as it is a common cut utilized for PID independent from the analyzed reaction, the selection conditions  remaining after all cuts (N cut B ) in relation to the number after preselection (N pres B ). In case of the background reactions the contributions as obtained in the data description were used to downscale the Monte Carlo simulations and to extract the numbers.",

Such different fit parameters for both data sets originated mainly from different experimental settings, which affected, e.g., the event overlap due to different luminosities. To determine the overall systematic uncertainty for the number of remaining background events, the probability density functions (pdf) of the individual uncertainties were folded.
