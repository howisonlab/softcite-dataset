The \u03b1 S determination in [7] is based on distributions and moments of these variables. Their theoretical description is currently the most advanced [10][11][12]. Further, we measure moments of Thrust major T maj , Thrust minor T min , Oblateness O, Sphericity S, Light Jet Mass M L , and Narrow Jet Broadening B N . Moments of these variables and variances of all measured event shapes will be made available in the HEPDATA database. 1 Generic event shape variables y are constructed such that spherical and multi-jet events yield large values of y, while two narrow back-to-back jets yield y 0. Thrust T is an exception to this rule. By using y = 1\u2212T instead the condition is fulfilled for all event shapes.",

The theoretical predictions using the O(\u03b1 2 S ) calculation described in Sect. 2 provide values at the parton level. It is necessary to correct for hadronisation effects in order to compare the theory with the hadron level data. Therefore the moments are calculated at hadron and parton level using large samples of PYTHIA 6.158 events and, as a cross check, samples obtained by simulation with HERWIG 6.2 and ARIADNE 4.11. Parton level is the stage at the end of the parton shower in the simulation of an hadronic event. In order to correct for hadronisation the data points are then multiplied by the ratio C had = y n part,MC / y n had,MC of the parton over hadron level moments; y n part = C had \u2022 y n had . The models use cuts on quantities like e.g. the invariant mass between partons in order to regulate divergencies in the predictions for the parton shower evolution. As a consequence in some events no parton shower is simulated and the original quark-antiquark pair enters the hadronisation stage of the model directly. This leads to a bias in the calculation of moments at the parton level, since y = 0 in this case for all observables considered here (y D 23 cannot be calculated in this case). In order to avoid this bias we exclude in the simulation at the parton level events without gluon radiation, as in [28]. After this exclusion, the \u221a s evolution of the moments follows the QCD prediction; the change of the pre-  A \u03c7 2 value for each moment y n is calculated using the formula",

The presence of highly correlated and dominant systematic errors makes a reliable estimate of V difficult. Undesirable features (such as negative weights) can be caused by small uncertainties in the estimation of Fig. 5.8 The ratio K = B n /A n of NLO and LO coefficients for the first five moments of the six event shape variables used in the determination of \u03b1 S , see also [7] these correlations. Therefore only experimental systematic errors-assumed to be partially correlated by minimum overlap as V ij = min(\u03c3 2 exp,i , \u03c3 2 exp,j )-and statistical correlations are taken to contribute to the off-diagonal elements of the covariance matrix. The statistical correlations are determined using MC simulations at the parton level. 8 The diagonal elements are calculated from all error contributionsstatistical, experimental, hadronisation and theory uncertainties. Using the weights derived from the covariance matrix V the theory uncertainties are computed by analogously combining the \u03b1 S (M Z 0 ) values from setting x \u03bc = 2.0 or x \u03bc = 0.5, and the hadronisation uncertainties by combining the results obtained with the alternative hadronisation models.",

The predictions of the PYTHIA, HERWIG and ARIADNE MC models tuned by OPAL to LEP 1 data are found to be in reasonable agreement with the measured moments. From fits of O(\u03b1 2 S ) predictions to selected event shape moments corrected for experimental and hadronisation effects we have determined the strong coupling to be \u03b1 S (M Z 0 ) = 0.1287 \u00b1 0.0079 (total error) using only JADE data, and \u03b1 S (M Z 0 ) = 0.1262 \u00b1 0.0065 (total error) using combined JADE and OPAL data. Fits to moments of M H , B W and y D 23 return large values of \u03c7 2 /d.o.f.; the higher moments, in particular of the 1 \u2212 T , C and B T event shape variables, lead to systematically enlarged values of \u03b1 S . Results where \u03b1 S is steeply rising with moment order are strongly correlated with the relative size of the\u1fb1 2 S coefficient and thus are most likely affected by deficiencies of the NLO prediction.",
