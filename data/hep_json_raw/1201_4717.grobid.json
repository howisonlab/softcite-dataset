            "text": "Measurements of the heavy quark production cross-sections in proton-proton collisions test the predictions of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), and probes the spectrum and dynamics of the colliding partons. The formation of heavy quarkonia states (bounded qq) can be factorized into two steps according to quantum chromodynamics (QCD). First, the creation of a qq pair via small-distance interactions (perturbative), followed by the evolution into a quarkonium state via the exchange of soft gluons (non perturbative). The non-relativistic QCD (NRQCD), predicts the probability of a heavy qq pair to evolve into heavy quarkonium, as a function of color-singlet (CS) [1] and coloroctet (CO) [2] matrix elements. The CS model, provides a leading-order (LO) description of quarkonium formation, but it underestimates the measured cross-section for J/\u03c8 production at Tevatron [3], particularly at high transverse momentum p T . This discrepancy can be reduced including processes such as quark and gluon fragmentation, but still it fails to reproduce the measured cross-section. The introduction of CO model, with the matrix elements tuned to data, improves the description of the measured shape and magnitude of the J/\u03c8 cross-section. Recent theoretical studies [4] incorporate higher order corrections to the CS models, reducing significantly the observed discrepancy in quarkonium production without including CO matrix elements. However, the agreement is still not perfect, leaving open the question of a complete description of quarkonia formation [5].",

Using the 2010 data sample of 40 pb \u22121 , the LHCb collaboration has measured several production cross-sections such us open charm [9], J/\u03c8 [10], double J/\u03c8 [11] production in the current LHC running conditions [16]. This calculation accounts for additional feed-down from J/\u03c8\u03c8(2S ) and \u03c8(2S )\u03c8(2S ) production, but not for double parton scattering. The extrapolated prediction to the angular LHCb coverage gives a cross-section of about 4 nb with a 30% of uncertainty. For this analysis, we use an integrated luminosity of 37.5 pb \u22121 , collected by the LHCb detector between July and November of 2010. J/\u03c8 meson candidates are reconstructed from a pair of oppositely-charged tracks identified as muons. Therefore, we select events with 4 of these tracks, originated from a common vertex, with good track quality and with p T < 650 MeV/c. Muon identification is achieved by comparing a global likelihood function provided by the particle identification, tracking and calorimeter subdetectors, with the corresponding likelihood for light hadrons. Selected \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 candidates, with an invariant mass of 3.0-3.2 GeV/c 2 , are paired to form (\u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) 1 (\u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) 2 combinations. Background coming from J/\u03c8 mesons associated to different production vertex and from B decays is removed by applying quality requirements to the vertex fit, constraining the 4 muons to come from the same vertex and requiring the vertex to be compatible with one of the primary vertices produced after the proton-proton collision.",

The effect of the global event cuts applied in the trigger has been studied in detail for inclusive J/\u03c8 events, and applied here assuming factorization. The largest systematic contribution is due to the knowledge of the track-finding efficiency. A 4% uncertainty per track is assigned, based on studies comparing the reconstruction efficiency in data and simulation, using a tagand-probe approach. Additional systematic uncertainties in the method to extract the efficiency have been accounted for, as well as data-simulation discrepancies. The luminosity was determined in specific periods during data taking, using both Van der Meer scans and beam gas imaging method [17]. The systematic uncertainty associated with these methods is of 10%. The total systematic contribution to the cross-section uncertainty was found to be of 21%.",

A significant excess, not attributed to any resonant state, is observed in the Q(B 0 \u03c0 + ) with respect to the Q(B + \u03c0 + ) distribution, interpreted as an associated production due to b-jet hadronization. This component is described using a kernel-like distribution. Signal resonances in the Q-distribution are modeled using relativistic Breit-Wigner lineshapes. The detector resolution is about 3 MeV/c 2 and can safely be neglected. The fit results are shown in Fig. 3. Here we observe the feeddown from the B + 1 /B * + 2 \u2192 B * 0 \u03c0 + and the B * + 2 \u2192 B 0 \u03c0 + states. To improve fit convergence, the relative width between the B + 1 and the B * + 2 is fixed to 0.9 and the relative yield between the B * + 2 \u2192 B * 0 \u03c0 + and B * + 2 \u2192 B 0 \u03c0 + fixed to 0.93, from theoretical predictions [6,24].",

The mass measurement of the \u2126 \u2212 b is of particular interest, since the masses reported for this state by the CDF and D\u2205 collaborations are inconsistent at the 6\u03c3 level [25]. Both decays share a similar topology and the presence of long-lived particles in the decay chain is exploited in the selection process. High background levels are observed near the interaction point, mainly from inclusive J/\u03c8 production, thus we reconstruct only candidates with lifetime above 0.3 ps. The mass resolution of the strange b-hadrons is improved by applying a constraint to the mass of the daughters in the vertex fit. The final selection places restrictions on the particle identification and quality of the final state tracks. In addition, a momentum calibration is applied based on a large sample of J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 candidates, that corrects for the description of the magnetic field and tracking system.
