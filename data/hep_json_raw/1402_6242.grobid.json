The decay modes used are \u039b 0 b \u2192 J /\u03c8 pK \u2212 and B 0 \u2192 J /\u03c8\u03c0 + K \u2212 , where the \u03c0 + K \u2212 mass is consistent with that of the K * 0 (892) meson. The lifetime ratio is determined with unprecedented precision to be 0.974 \u00b1 0.006 \u00b1 0.004, where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second systematic. This result is in agreement with original theoretical predictions based on the heavy quark expansion. Using the current world average of the B 0 lifetime, the \u039b 0 b lifetime is found to be 1.479 \u00b1 0.009 \u00b1 0.010 ps.",

            "text": "The heavy quark expansion (HQE) is a powerful theoretical technique in the description of decays of hadrons containing heavy quarks. This model describes inclusive decays and has been used extensively in the analysis of beauty and charm hadron decays, for example in the extraction of Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix elements, such as |V cb | and |V ub | [1]. The basics of the theory were derived in the late 1980s [2]. For b-flavored hadrons, the expansion of the total decay width in terms of powers of 1/m b , where m b is the b quark mass, was derived a few years later [3]. These developments are summarized in Ref. [4]. It was found that there were no terms of O(1/m b ), that the O(1/m 2 b ) terms were tiny, and initial estimates of O(1/m 3 b ) [5,6] effects were small. Thus differences of only a few percent were expected between the \u039b 0 b and B 0 total decay widths, and hence their lifetimes [5,7,8].",
