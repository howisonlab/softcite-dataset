The resulting distribution is fitted with a Breit-Wigner function plus a straight line to account for a remaining residual background (figure 1 left). The raw yields of \u03d5(1020) and \u039e(1530) 0 are extracted by fitting the invariant mass distributions with a function composed by a polynomial to describe the background, plus a Voigtian, i.e. the convolution of a Gaussian and a Breit- Wigner (figure 1 right). This choice is necessary to take into account the resolution in invariant mass, since it ranges between 1 and 2 MeV/c 2 and is therefore comparable with the nominal widths of these resonances (4.25 and 9.1 MeV/c 2 , respectively).",
