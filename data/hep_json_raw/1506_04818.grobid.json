This will allow us to measure the rare processes from the top sector in great details. We present a study of top-quark pair production in association with a bottom-quark pair (ttbb) from fast simulations for the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment. The differential distributions of ttbb are compared with the top-quark pair production with two additional jets (ttjj) and with the production in association with the Higgs (ttH), where the Higgs decays to a bottom-quark pair. The significances of the ttbb process in the dileptonic and the semileptonic decay modes are calculated with the data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 10 fb \u22121 , which is foreseen to be collected in the early Run II period. This study will provide an important input in searching for new physics beyond the standard model, as well as in searching for the ttH process where the Yukawa coupling with the top quark can be directly measured.",

The fact that the top quark has the largest mass in the standard model has convinced us of its important role for checking the consistency of the Higgs boson with the standard model predictions. One of the most promising channels for a direct measurement of the top quark's Yukawa coupling is the production of a top-quark pair in association with the Higgs boson. The Higgs boson which decays to bb in the standard model will lead to a ttbb final state. This final state, which has not yet been observed using Run I (2010-2012) data, has an irreducible nonresonant background from the production of a top quark pair in association with two jets faking b jets or with a b quark pair.",

In the best scenario where the b jet assignment is correct, the study clearly shows that the invariant mass and the \u2206R variables of the two additional jets are the promising variables for separating out those three processes. In reality, identifying the origin of the b jets at the reconstruction level with the real data events remains challenging. Because in a real data analysis, no single best variable would be able to separate the ttH process from the ttbb or ttjj process, this would require us to perform a multivariate analysis to increase the significance. In the multivariate analysis, the variables that we presented here can be used as input variables.",

The invariant mass and \u2206R variable of two additional jets are promising variables to separate ttbb events from ttjj and ttH events. However, identifying the origin of the b jets at the reconstruction level with real data events is challenging. With the 10 fb \u22121 data, in the best scenario with a simple cut and count method, we can reach 2.9 and 5.8 standard deviations for the dileptonic decay mode and the semileptonic decay mode, respectively. When the systematic uncertainty for the cross section measurement of the tt production is taken into account, the significance goes down to 1.9 for the dileptonic mode and 1.8 for the semileptonic mode, so the values of the significance becomes compatible with each other. This would require us to measure the tt pair production cross section precisely at \u221a s = 13 TeV and to use a more complex approach, such as a multivariate technique, for the ttbb cross section mea-surement.",
