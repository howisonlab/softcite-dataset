            "text": "The standard model (SM) of particle physics describes elementary particles and their interactions successfully. Nevertheless, fine tuning of fundamental physics parameters is needed to cancel large quantum corrections to the mass term in the Higgs potential [1]. This and other problems of the SM can be addressed by supersymmetry (SUSY) models [2][3][4][5][6][7][8], in which a SUSY partner particle is predicted for each SM particle. Gauge-mediated SUSY breaking (GMSB) models [9][10][11][12][13][14][15] allow for a natural suppression of flavour violations in the SUSY sector and can give rise to final states with photons and jets [16]. The conservation of R parity [17,18] implies that SUSY particles are produced in pairs and the lightest SUSY particle (LSP) is stable. If the LSP is neutral and only weakly interacting, it can escape detection, leading to an imbalance of the total observed transverse momentum. In this analysis, R-parity conservation is assumed and the LSP is considered to be a nearly massless gravitino G. The next-to-lightest-supersymmetric particle is assumed to be a gaugino \u03c7 0/\u00b1 1 , which is a mixture of the superpartners of the electroweak gauge bosons and the Higgs bosons. It decays promptly to a SM boson and a gravitino. Both bino-and wino-like neutralinos \u03c7 0 1 can decay to a photon and a gravitino;",

To generate \u03b3+jet, multijet, Z, W, tt, \u03b3W, \u03b3Z, gluino pair, and squark pair events, the Mad-Graph5 amc@nlo 2.2.2 [31] generator is used at leading-order (LO) accuracy, while the next-to-leading-order (NLO) accuracy is used for \u03b3tt events. The NNPDF3.0 [32] parton distribution functions (PDFs) are used in conjunction with pythia 8.205 or 8.212 [33] with the CUETP8M1 generator tune [34] for simulating parton showering and hadronization. The LO cross sections are used for \u03b3+jet events and events comprising solely jets produced through the strong interaction (multijet events). For all other background processes, NLO cross sections are used. The contribution of pileup events is added to the hard scattering process such that the probability of pileup events to occur is the same as that in the data, with on average approximately 23 interactions per bunch crossing. Gluino and squark pair production cross sections are determined using NLO plus nextto-leading logarithm (NLL) calculations [35]. Four simplified models [36,37] are considered. The T6gg model, where a first-or second-generation squark-antisquark pair is produced, followed by the (anti)squark decay into an (anti)quark and a neutralino. The neutralino JHEP12 (2017)142decays promptly to a photon and a gravitino, resulting in a final state with two jets, two photons, and missing transverse momentum from the two gravitinos escaping detection. The T6Wg model is similar, except the squarks decay with a probability of 50% to a quark and a neutralino, and a 50% probability to decay to a quark and a chargino. The chargino further decays to a W boson and a gravitino, resulting in signatures with at least two jets, two gravitinos, and two bosons. These two bosons can either be two photons, one photon and one W boson, or two W bosons. The T5gg and T5Wg models consist of gluino pair production. For these models, the squark masses are assumed to be much larger than the gluino mass, leading to a three-body decay of the gluino to two jets and a gaugino. For the T5gg model, the gauginos are neutralinos, while for the T5Wg model, the gluino can also decay to jets and a chargino. Branching fractions are assumed to be 100%, except the squark to neutralino branching fraction in the T6Wg model and the gluino to neutralino decay in the T5Wg model, which are 50% each. Feynman-like diagrams of these processes are shown in figure 1.",

The factor is chosen such that it minimizes the \u03c7 2 between the shapes of the p miss T distributions in the two CRs for p miss T < 100 GeV, and is about 0.90 (0.84) for the low-(high-) H \u03b3 T selection. The uncertainty in this factor is calculated as the quadratic sum of the deviation of the factor from unity and the statistical uncertainty in the \u03c7 2 method. The p miss T distribution of the jet CR is then scaled to the p miss T distribution of the photon CR in p miss T < 100 GeV to provide an estimate for the background contribution of nongenuine p miss T events in the signal selection. Several uncertainties are considered. The uncertainty associated to the shift factor is obtained by multiplying the jet CR by the factor modulated by its uncertainty. The uncertainty in the normalization is derived from the statistical uncertainty of the photon CR and the jet CR in the p miss T < 100 GeV range. The statistical uncertainty assigned to the prediction due to the number of events in the jet CR at high p miss T is about as large as the systematic uncertainty. The method is tested on simulated \u03b3+jet and multijet events. The comparison of direct simulation results and the prediction from simulation, using this method, is shown in figure 2.

The reconstruction and identification efficiencies for photons are measured in JHEP12 2017 Z \u2192 ee and Z \u2192 \u00b5\u00b5\u03b3 data and simulation. The ratio of these efficiencies is consistent with unity and has an uncertainty of about 3%. Simulated events are weighted by the ratio of the efficiencies, and the uncertainty is propagated to the event yield. The NLO cross sections are used, and several uncertainties are considered, with their relative uncertainties given here in parentheses: factorization and renormalization scales (16-27%), PDFs (5-10%) [43], contribution of pileup events (0.2-6%), trigger efficiency (4%), jet resolution and energy scales (2-20%), integrated luminosity (2.5%) [44], and statistical uncertainty of the simulated samples (4-47%). For the study of the renormalization and factorization scale uncertainties, variations up and down by a factor of two with respect to the nominal values of the scales are considered. The maximum difference in the yields with respect to the nominal case is used as the uncertainty. The pileup uncertainty corresponds to the variation of the number of predicted events if the total inelastic proton-proton cross section is shifted by \u00b15%.",

            "text": "To improve on the signal simulation of the multiplicity of additional jets from ISR, simulated signal events are reweighted based on the number of ISR jets (N ISR J ) so as to make the jet multiplicity in simulated tt samples agree with that in data. The reweighting factors vary between 0.92 and 0.51 for N ISR J between 1 and 6. We take one half of the deviation from unity as the systematic uncertainty in these reweighting factors, correlated between all search regions. The renormalization and factorization scales, and PDF uncertainties in the cross sections for signal simulation are taken from ref. [35]. To estimate the influence of pileup in signal events, the selection is done with a high and a low number of additional interactions. The difference in selection efficiency is taken as a systematic uncertainty. Since all physics objects are included in the computation of p miss T , it can be difficult to describe accurately within the CMS fast simulation. The p miss T of the models considered, however, is dominated by the missing momentum carried away by the gravitons and not by the modelling of resolution effects. An additional systematic uncertainty of between 0.5 and 6% is assigned by calculating the mean difference between the reconstructed and generated p miss T . A summary of the uncertainties can be found in table 2. The results are interpreted in terms of the simplified models introduced in section 4. The 95% confidence level (CL) upper limits on the SUSY cross section are calculated with -11 -JHEP12 (2017)142the CL s criterion [45,46] using the LHC-style profile likelihood ratio as test statistic [47] evaluated in the asymptotic approximation [48]. Log-normal nuisance parameters are used to describe the systematic uncertainties. The observed upper limits on cross sections, exclusion contours, and expected exclusion contours are shown in figure 6. More stringent limits can be set on models with two photons, since the probability that at least one photon is reconstructed is higher. In this case, for high gaugino masses, squarks up to 1650 GeV and gluinos up to 2000 GeV can be excluded, while for the T6Wg and T5Wg scenarios, squarks up to 1550 GeV and gluinos up to 1900 GeV can be excluded for high gaugino masses. The acceptance drops for low neutralino masses, since more energy is transferred to jets, leaving less energy available for the photon and the gravitinos, and therefore resulting in a lower value of p miss T . If the chargino mass is close to the W boson mass, less momentum is transferred to the gravitino, leading to smaller p miss T values and, therefore, lower sensitivity. This yields a squark mass exclusion of 1500 and 1300 GeV for the T6gg and T6Wg model, respectively, and a gluino mass exclusion of 1750 and 1500 GeV for the T5gg and T5Wg model, respectively. For squark pair production, the mass exclusion is determined assuming eight mass-degenerate squark states, corresponding to the SUSY partners of the left-and right-handed u, d, s, and c quarks.",
