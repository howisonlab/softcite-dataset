The search uses proton-proton collision data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb \u22121 at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV collected in 2015 and 2016 with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. Events are required to have at least one jet with a transverse momentum above 250 GeV and no leptons (e or \u00b5). Several signal regions are considered with increasing requirements on the missing transverse momentum above 250 GeV. Good agreement is observed between the number of events in data and Standard Model predictions. The results are translated into exclusion limits in models with pair-produced weakly interacting dark-matter candidates, large extra spatial dimensions, and supersymmetric particles in several compressed scenarios.",

The data were collected by the ATLAS Collaboration at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) from proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy ( \u221a s) of 13 TeV. The final-state monojet signature of at least one energetic jet, E miss T > 250 GeV, and no leptons (e or \u00b5) constitutes a distinctive -1 -JHEP01(2018)126 signature for new physics beyond the Standard Model (SM) at colliders. The monojet signature has been extensively studied at the LHC in the context of searches for large extra spatial dimensions (LED), supersymmetry (SUSY), and weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) as candidates for dark matter (DM) [1][2][3]. The results of the analysis are therefore interpreted in terms of each of these models, which are described in the following paragraphs.",

Four such scenarios with compressed mass spectra are considered: stop-pair production, where the stop decays into a charm quark and the LSP (t 1 \u2192 c +\u03c7 0 1 ), stop-pair production in the four-body decay modet 1 \u2192 b + f f +\u03c7 0 1 , sbottom-pair production with b 1 \u2192 b +\u03c7 0 1 , and squark-pair production withq \u2192 q +\u03c7 0 1 (q = u, d, c, s). For relatively small \u2206m ( 25 GeV), both the transverse momenta of the quark jets and the E miss T in the final state are small, making it difficult to fully reconstruct the signal given the kinematic thresholds for reconstruction. The presence of jets from ISR is thus used to identify signal events (see figure 1(e)). In this case, the squark-pair system is boosted, leading to larger E miss T .",

The generation of the different subprocesses is performed following a procedure outlined in ref. [18]. Specifically, the generation is split between DM production with an off-shell mediator and on-shell mediator production followed by decay, and the associated production of up to two partons in the final state is included. As already mentioned, only diagrams involving the first two quark generations are considered and processes with electroweak bosons are suppressed. The matching between MadGraph and Pythia is performed following the CKKW-L prescription [51].

The W +jets and Z+jets MC predictions are reweighted to account for higher-order QCD and electroweak corrections as described in ref.

The predictions are provided separately for the different W +jets and Z+jets processes together with the means for a proper estimation of theoretical uncertainties and their correlations (see section 7).

The W/Z+jets background predictions receive a multiplicative normalization factor of 1.27. Similarly, top-quark-related processes receive a normalization factor of 1.06. When the binned likelihood fit is performed simultaneously over the different exclusive E miss T regions, thus including information from the shape of the measured E miss T distribution, the normalization factor of the W/Z+jets background predictions remains essentially unchanged, dominated by the low-E miss T region, and that of the top-quark-related processes becomes 1.31, correlated with a less than 1\u03c3 pull of the top-quark-related uncertainties within the fit. Figures 2 and 3 show the distributions of the E miss T and the leading-jet p T in data and MC simulation in the different control regions. In this case, the MC predictions include the data-driven normalization factors as extracted from the binned likelihood fit to the different exclusive E miss T bins. Altogether, the MC simulation provides a good description, within uncertainties, of the shape of the measured distributions in the different control regions.",

The experimental uncertainties related to the jet and E miss T scales and resolutions introduce similar uncertainties in the signal yields for axial-vector, vector and pseudoscalar models. They vary between 2% and 7% for the IM1 selection and between 3% and 9% for the IM10 selection, depending on the parameters of the model. In the case of the coloured scalar mediator model, these uncertainties vary between 2% and 6% for IM1 and between 4% and about 10% for IM10. The uncertainty related to the modelling of the initial-and final-state radiation translates into a 20% uncertainty in the signal acceptance, common to all the s-channel models. In the case of the coloured scalar mediator model, this uncertainty varies between 10% and 30%, depending on the kinematic selection. The choice of different PDF sets results in up to a 20% uncertainty in the acceptance and up to a 10% uncertainty in the cross section, depending on the model considered. Varying the renormalization and factorization scales introduces up to 25% variations of the cross section and up to 10% change in the acceptance, depending on the model considered. In addition, the uncertainty in the integrated luminosity is included.",

The fit accounts for the contamination of the control regions by signal events which a priori is estimated to be very small. Figure 5(a) shows the observed and expected 95% CL exclusion contours in the m Z Am \u03c7 parameter plane for a simplified model with an axial-vector mediator, Dirac WIMPs, and couplings g q = 1/4 and g \u03c7 = 1. In addition, observed limits are shown using \u00b11\u03c3 theoretical uncertainties in the signal cross sections. In the on-shell regime, the models with mediator masses up to 1.55 TeV are excluded for m \u03c7 = 1 GeV. For m \u03c7 < 1 GeV, the monojet analysis maintains its sensitivity for excluding DM models. This analysis loses sensitivity to the models in the off-shell regime, where cross sections are suppressed due to the virtual production of the mediator. Perturbative unitarity is violated in the parameter region defined by m \u03c7 > \u03c0/2 m Z A [92]. The masses corresponding to the relic density [93] as determined by the Planck and WMAP satellites [9,10], within the WIMP dark-matter model and in the absence of any interaction other than the one considered, are indicated in the figure as a line that crosses the excluded region at m Z A \u223c 1200 GeV and m \u03c7 \u223c 440 GeV.

Cylindrical coordinates (r, \u03c6) are used in the transverse plane, \u03c6 being the azimuthal angle around the z-axis. The pseudorapidity is defined in terms of the polar angle \u03b8 as \u03b7 = \u2212 ln tan(\u03b8/2).",
