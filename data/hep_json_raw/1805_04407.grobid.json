            "text": "The measurement of dielectron production is presented as a function of invariant mass and transverse momentum (p T ) at midrapidity (| y e | < 0.8) in proton-proton (pp) collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of \u221a s = 13 TeV. The contributions from light-hadron decays are calculated from their measured cross sections in pp collisions at \u221a s = 7 TeV or 13 TeV. The remaining continuum stems from correlated semileptonic decays of heavy-flavour hadrons. Fitting the data with templates from two different MC event generators, PYTHIA and POWHEG, the charm and beauty cross sections at midrapidity are extracted for the first time at this collision energy: d\u03c3 cc /dy| y=0 = 974 \u00b1 138 (stat.) \u00b1 140 (syst.) \u00b1 214(BR) \u03bcb and d\u03c3 bb /dy| y=0 = 79 \u00b1 14 (stat.) \u00b1 11 (syst.) \u00b1 5(BR) \u03bcb using PYTHIA simulations and d\u03c3 cc /dy| y=0 = 1417 \u00b1 184 (stat.) \u00b1 204 (syst.) \u00b1 312(BR) \u03bcb and d\u03c3 bb /dy| y=0 = 48 \u00b1 14 (stat.) \u00b1 7 (syst.) \u00b1 3(BR) \u03bcb for POWHEG. These values, whose uncertainties are fully correlated between the two generators, are consistent with extrapolations from lower energies. The different results obtained with POWHEG and PYTHIA imply different kinematic correlations of the heavy-quark pairs in these two generators. Furthermore, comparisons of dielectron spectra in inelastic events and in events collected with a trigger on high charged-particle multiplicities are presented in various p T intervals. The differences are consistent with the already measured scaling of light-hadron and open-charm production at high charged-particle multiplicity as a function of p T . Upper limits for the contribution of virtual direct photons are extracted at 90% confidence level and found to be in agreement with pQCD calculations.",

            "text": "Heavy-flavour quarks (charm and beauty) are copiously produced by inelastic partonic scatterings in high-energy protonproton (pp) collisions at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Their large masses (m Q ) make it possible to calculate their production cross sections with perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD) [1][2][3]. Hence, experimental measurements of heavyquark production provide an excellent test of pQCD in this energy regime. Flavour conservation allows heavy quarks to be only produced in pairs. Charm hadrons and their decay products reflect the initial angular correlation of the heavy-quark pairs, whereas in the case of decays of beauty hadrons the correlation is weakened due to their large masses. The contribution from the simultaneous semileptonic decays of the corresponding heavy-flavour hadron pairs dominates the dilepton yield in the intermediate mass region",

These results are generally in good agreement with pQCD calculations at next-to-leading order (NLO) in the strong coupling constant (\u03b1 s ) with all-order resummation of the logarithms of p T /m Q (FONLL) [1][2][3]. Though the measured charm production cross sections consistently lie on the upper edge of the systematic uncertainties of the theory calculations. Recently, the ALICE Collaboration has measured the charm and beauty production cross sections in pp collisions at \u221a s = 7 TeV using electron-positron pairs (dielectrons) from correlated semileptonic decays of heavy-flavour hadrons [25]. Such an approach was first performed by the PHENIX (RHIC) [26][27][28]. These measurements have the advantage that they probe the full p T range of heavy-quark pairs and contain complementary information about the initial correlation of charm quarks, i.e. the underlying production mechanism, which is not accessible in conventional single heavy-flavour measurements. The measurement of direct photons, i.e. those produced in hard scatterings between incoming partons in hadronic collisions, provides another important test of pQCD. Furthermore, at p T < 3 GeV/c, where the applicability of perturbation theory may be questionable, experimental data of direct-photon production in pp collisions serve as a crucial reference to establish the presence of thermal radiation from the hot and dense medium created in heavy-ion collisions [29][30][31][32]. The measurement of real (massless) direct photons at low p T is challenging because of the large background of hadron decay photons. This background can be largely reduced by measuring the contribution of virtual direct photons, i.e. direct e + e \u2212 pairs, to the dielectron invariant-mass spectrum above the \u03c0 0 mass [29,30].",

            "text": "Proton-proton collisions in which a large number of charged particles are produced have recently attracted the interest of the heavy-ion community [33,34]. These events exhibit features that are similar to those observed in heavy-ion collisions, e.g. collective effects, such as long-range angular correlations [35][36][37][38][39][40]  . Also, heavy-quark production is found to scale faster than linearly with the charged-particle multiplicity in pp collisions at 43,44]. This motivates the study of dielectron production in high-multiplicity pp collisions. In the low mass region (m ee < 1 GeV/c 2 ), dielectron measurements provide further insight into possible modifications of the light vector and pseudoscalar meson production via their resonance and/or Dalitz decays, whereas in the IMR they allow for complementary studies of the heavy-flavour production. At LHC energies, the contribution from open charm already dominates the dielectron continuum at m ee \u2248 0.5 GeV/c 2 . Moreover, if a thermalised system were created in such high-multiplicity pp collisions, a signal of thermal (virtual) photons should be present. In this letter, first results of charm and beauty production cross sections at midrapidity in inelastic (INEL) and high-multiplicity (HM) pp collisions at \u221a s = 13 TeV are reported. The paper is organised as follows: the ALICE apparatus and the data samples used in the analysis are described in Section 2, the data analysis is discussed in Section 3, Section 4 introduces the cocktail of known hadronic sources, and the results are presented and discussed in Section 5.",

The choice of the different Pythia versions is motivated by the fact that the Perugia 2011 tune describes reasonably well the transverse momentum spectra of heavy-flavour hadrons while the Monash 2013 tune reproduces many of the relevant light-hadron multiplicities [55,56].

The systematic uncertainties due to the track reconstruction are estimated by comparing the efficiency of the ITS-TPC matching, the requirement of a hit in the first SPD layer, and the requirement of no shared ITS clusters in MC simulations and data. The residual disagreements between data and MC add to a 6.5% uncertainty on the single track level, which leads to a 13% uncertainty for pairs. The MC simulations were also checked to reproduce all details of the PID selection within a systematic uncertainty of 2% for e + e \u2212 pairs. The purity of the electron sample is estimated to be >93% over the relevant p T range, with a p T -integrated hadron contamination of about 4%. The resulting hadron contamination on the dielectron signal is found to be negligible. For m ee < 0.14 GeV/c 2 , a 2% uncertainty on the conversion rejection was estimated from the yield change when tightening the selection to reject photon conversions. A 2% uncertainty on the signal yield due to the correction factor R is obtained by repeating the event mixing in different event classes, defined by the position of the reconstructed primary vertex and by the charged-particle multiplicity. The efficiency of the minimum-bias trigger to select inelastic events with an e + e \u2212 pair in the ALICE acceptance (|\u03b7 e | < 0.8 and p T, e > 0.2 GeV/c) is estimated to be (99 \u00b1 1)% from the Monash 2013 tune of Pythia 8.",

In such events the vertex distribution is biased more than in MB events by the asymmetric pseudorapidity coverage of the two V0 detectors. The change of the detector acceptance with vertex position could lead to a difference in the number of reconstructed electrons of up to 3%, which results in an uncertainty of 6% for e + e \u2212 pairs. Second, a possible multiplicity dependence of the reconstruction and PID efficiency is covered by an uncertainty of 6% [57]. Added in quadrature, this amounts to a total uncertainty of 15%.  [55,56]. Therefore, MC simulations obtained with this tune at \u221a s = 13 TeV are used to obtain the \u03c1/\u03c0 0 and \u03c9/\u03c0 0 ratios. Based on the \u03b7/\u03c0 0 , \u03c1/\u03c0 0 and \u03c9/\u03c0 0 data, the ratios at high p T are 0.5 \u00b1 0.1, 1.0 \u00b1 0.2 and 0.85 \u00b1 0.17, respectively.

For the m T scaling, particle yields are normalised at high p T relative to the \u03c0 0 yield: 0.40 \u00b1 0.08 for \u03b7",

For the high-multiplicity cocktail, the input hadron p T -distributions are adjusted according to the measured modifications of the charged-hadron p T spectra [42]. The uncertainties of the cocktail from light-hadron decays are about \u00b115%, reaching up to +50% in the region dominated by the \u03b7 meson due to uncertainties in the extrapolation to low p T . The multiplicity dependence has an uncertainty that varies between about 12% at low p T and 40% at high p T . The Perugia 2011 tune of Pythia 6.4, which includes NLO parton showering processes, is used to estimate the contributions of correlated semileptonic decays of open charm and beauty hadrons [53,65]. As an alternative, the NLO event generator Powheg is also considered [66][67][68][69]. The resulting same-sign spectrum is subtracted from the opposite-sign distribution as in the data analysis. Detector effects are implemented as for the light-hadron cocktail. The spectra are normalised to cross sections at midrapidity that are based on FONLL [1][2][3] extrapolations of the ALICE measurements at 7 TeV [8][9][10]. Following the description in [70]  ",

The result, integrated over p T, ee < 6 GeV/c, is shown as a function of m ee in the left panel of Fig. 2. The data are compared with the expectation from the hadronic decay cocktail, using Pythia for the heavy-flavour components, and found to be in agreement within uncertainties. Good agreement between data and cocktail calculations is also found as a function of p T, ee , which is shown for three m ee intervals in the right panel of Fig. 2. Figs. 3 and 4 show the ratios of the dielectron spectra in high-multiplicity over inelastic events as a function of m ee for different p T, ee intervals. To account for the trivial scaling with charged-particle multiplicity, the ratio is scaled by the factor dN ch /d\u03b7(HM)/ dN ch /d\u03b7(INEL) = 6.27 \u00b1 0.22, where dN ch / d\u03b7(HM) = 33.29 \u00b1 0.39 and dN ch /d\u03b7(INEL) = 5.31 \u00b1 0.18 are the charged-particle multiplicities in |\u03b7 ch | < 0.5 measured in highmultiplicity and inelastic pp collisions, respectively [42]. In this ratio, the multiplicity-independent uncertainties cancel and the total  This points to important differences in the heavy quark production mechanisms between the two generators. It should be stressed that single heavy-flavour measurements appear insensitive to these differences as the cross sections obtained from such measurements agree between Pythia and Powheg based extrapolations [7,11,22]. Therefore, dielectrons provide complementary information on heavy-flavour production that, if properly modelled, should lead to consistent cross sections with Pythia and Powheg. Table 2 also summarises the corresponding cross sections for the high-multiplicity data. In case of Pythia, the measured charm cross section translates into an enhancement of 1.86 \u00b10.40 (stat.) \u00b1 0.40 (syst.) relative to the charged-particle multiplicity increase. This is consistent with the modelled multiplicity dependence used   whose shape is described by the Kroll-Wada equation [77,78] in the quasi-real virtual photon regime (p T, ee m ee ).

A fast MC simulation is used to estimate the contribution from \u03c0 0 , \u03b7, \u03b7 , \u03c1, \u03c9 and \u03c6 decays in pp collisions, as detailed in [25]. Following the approach outlined in [58], the pion p T -spectrum at \u221a s = 13 TeV is approximated by scaling the p T -spectrum of charged hadrons [42] by the pion-to-hadron ratio measured at \u221a s = 7 TeV [59,60]. The difference with respect to the same procedure based on the pion-to-hadron ratio measured at \u221a s = 2.76 TeV [59,61] is smaller than 1% at low p T and reaches 5% at high p T . The charged hadron p T -spectra at \u221a s = 13 TeV are normalised to INEL>0 events, i.e. inelastic collisions that produce at least one charged particle in |\u03b7| < 1, rather than INEL events. This is corrected taking the 21% difference in the p T integrated dN ch /d\u03b7values for these two event classes [42]. A conservative uncertainty of 10% is assigned on this extrapolation. A fit of the obtained charged-pion p T -spectrum with a modified Hagedorn function is then taken as proxy for the neutral-pion p T -distribution. The simulated cross section per unit rapidity of the \u03c0 0 is d\u03c3 /dy| y=0 = 155.2 mb. For the \u03b7 meson a fit of the measured \u03b7/\u03c0 0 ratio in pp collisions at \u221a s = 7 TeV is used [62]. The Monash 2013 tune of Pythia 8 describes the \u03c1/\u03c0 0 and \u03c9/\u03c0 0 ratios measured in pp collisions at \u221a",

The latter (dominated by scale uncertainties but also including PDF and mass uncertainties) are considered to be fully correlated between the two energies [71]. For the high-multiplicity cocktail, the open charm contribution is weighted as a function of p T according to the measured enhancement of D mesons with p T > 1 GeV/c at \u221a s = 7 TeV [43]. The same weights are applied to the open beauty contribution as no significant difference between the production of D mesons and J /\u03c8 from beauty-hadron decays is observed [43].For electrons originating from charm or beauty hadrons with p T < 1 GeV/c, the same weight as for 1 < p T < 2 GeV/c is assumed in the absence of a measurement. This leads to an uncertainty on the multiplicity dependence of about 40% at low p T decreasing to 20% at high p T .The J /\u03c8 contribution is simulated with Pythia 6.4 and normalised to the cross section at \u221a s = 13 TeV, extrapolated with FONLL[9] from the measurement at",
