            "text": "The study of heavy-quark production in high-energy hadronic interactions plays a critical role in testing nextto-leading order (NLO) quantum chromodynamics (QCD) calculations [1]. The first such measurements were made more than two decades ago by the UA1 Collaboration at the CERN S \" ppS collider [2,3] operating at a center of mass energy of ffiffi ffi s p \u00bc 0:63 TeV, while more recent measurements have been made by the CDF and D0 Collaborations at the Fermilab Tevatron for ffiffi ffi s p \u00bc 1:8 and 1.96 TeV [4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11]. Substantial progress has been achieved in the understanding of heavy-quark production at Tevatron energies [12], but large theoretical uncertainties remain due to the dependence on the renormalization and factorization scales. Particularly important in the perturbative expansion are terms that scale as powers of ln\u00f0 ffiffi ffi s p =m b \u00de at low transverse momentum p T of the b quark [13,14], or as powers of ln\u00f0p T =m b \u00de when p T ) m b [15], where m b is the mass of the b quark. Measurements of b-hadron production at the higher energies provided by the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) represent an important new test of theoretical calculations [16,17].",

The M B PDFs are the sum of three (two) Gaussians for the signal (J=c ) with parameters obtained from simulation; an exponential for both prompt and nonprompt J=c ; and a combination of two Gaussians and an exponential for the peaking b \" b background. The resolution on M B for signal decays is approximately 30 MeV. The ct PDFs are a single exponential convolved with the resolution function to describe the signal, J=c , and peaking background components, where the lifetime is allowed to be different for the latter; the sum of two exponentials convolved with the resolution function for the nonprompt J=c component; and the pure resolution function for the prompt J=c component. The resolution function is common for signal and background, and is described by the sum of two or three Gaussian functions, depending on p B",

This technique relies on the assumption that in the signal-free region 5:40 < M B < 5:55 GeV (upper sideband) there are only two contributions: prompt and nonprompt J=c background (ignoring the small contribution from J=c ). To obtain the effective lifetime of the nonprompt J=c background, the ct distribution is fitted for events in the inclusive B \u00fe sample defined by p B T > 5 GeV and jy B j < 2:4 that lie in the M B upper sideband region, allowing the resolution function parameters to vary freely. The resolution function is then fixed and the signal B \u00fe lifetime in the inclusive sample is obtained by fitting ct and M B simultaneously. The result, c \u00bc 481 AE 22 m (statistical uncertainty only), is in good agreement with the world-average value of 491 AE 9 m [20]. With the effective lifetime for signal and nonprompt background fixed, the resolution function parameters are then determined separately in each bin of p B",
