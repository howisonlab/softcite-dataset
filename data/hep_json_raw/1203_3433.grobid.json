This very tightly bunched beam allowed a very accurate time-of-flight measurement of neutrinos from CERN to LNGS on an event-by-event basis. The ICARUS T600 detector (CNGS2) has collected 7 beam-associated events, consistent with the CNGS collected neutrino flux of 2.2 \u00d7 10 16 p.o.t. and in agreement with the well-known characteristics of neutrino events in the LAr-TPC. The time of flight difference between the speed of light and the arriving neutrino LAr-TPC events has been analysed. The result \u03b4t = 0.3 \u00b1 4.9(stat.) \u00b1 9.0(syst.) ns is compatible with the simultaneous arrival of all events with speed equal to that of light. This is in a striking difference with the reported result of OPERA (OPERA Collaboration, 2011)  [1] claiming that high energy neutrinos from CERN arrive at LNGS \u223c 60 ns earlier than expected from luminal speed.",

            "text": "The OPERA Collaboration has recently announced the measurement of the velocity of neutrinos, as they travel from CERN to the Gran Sasso Laboratory (LNGS) covering a distance of about 730 km [1]. OPERA (CNGS1) reported the surprising result that neutrinos arrive earlier than expected from luminal speed by a time interval \u03b4t = 57.8 \u00b1 7.8(stat.) +8.3 \u22125.9 (syst.) ns. This corresponds to a superluminal propagation speed of neutrinos of an amount \u03b4c \u03bd = (2.37 \u00b1 0.32(stat.) +0.34 \u22120.24 (syst.)) \u00d7 10 \u22125 , where \u03b4c \u03bd = (v \u03bd \u2212 c)/c. MINOS [2] had previously performed a similar measurement after a distance of 735 km and a neutrino spectrum with an average energy of 3 GeV. Although less significant statistically, the corresponding MINOS result is \u03b4c \u03bd = (5.1 \u00b1 2.9) \u00d7 10 \u22125 at 68% C.L., or \u223c 1.8\u03c3 different from zero. The corresponding 99% confidence interval on the speed of the neutrino is \u22122.4 \u00d7 10 \u22125 \u03b4c \u03bd 12.6 \u00d7 10 \u22125 . Earlier experiments [3] had set upper limits of about \u03b4c \u03bd 4 \u00d7 10 \u22125 in the energy range 30-300 GeV.",

Cohen and Glashow [4] have argued that such super-luminal neutrinos should lose energy by producing photons and e + e \u2212 pairs, through Z 0 mediated processes, analogous to Cherenkov radiation. In the same CNGS neutrino beam from CERN, the ICARUS Collaboration (CNGS2) [5][6][7] has recently experimentally searched for superluminal Cherenkov-like pairs inside the fiducial volume of its large LAr-TPC detector [8]. No candidate event was found, setting a tight negative limit \u03b4c \u03bd 2.5 \u00d7 10 \u22128 at 90% confidence level, in the framework of the Cohen and Glashow model. The limit for the Co-hen and Glashow effect at our energies is therefore comparable to the limit on \u03b4c \u03bd from the lower energy SN1987A [9][10][11][12].",
