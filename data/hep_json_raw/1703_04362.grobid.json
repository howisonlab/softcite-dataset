These triple and quartic gauge-boson couplings provide a unique means to test for new fundamental interactions. The fusion of electroweak (EW) bosons is a particularly important process for measuring particle properties, such as the couplings of the Higgs boson, and for searching for new particles beyond the Standard Model [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11]. In proton-proton ( pp) collisions, a characteristic signature of these processes is the production of two high-momentum jets of hadrons at small angles with respect to the incoming proton beams [12]. Measurements of this vector-boson-fusion (VBF) topology have been performed in W [13], Z [14,15] and Higgs [16] boson production, though the observation of purely electroweak processes in this topology has only been achieved in individual measurements of Z -boson production. This paper presents a precise measurement of electroweak W -boson production in the VBF topology, with a significance well above the standard for claiming observation, as well as differential cross section measurements and constraints on anomalous triple-gauge-boson couplings (aTGCs).",

            "text": "The production of a W boson in association with two or more jets (W j j) is dominated by processes involving strong interactions (strong W j j or QCD W j j). These processes have been extensively studied by experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) [17,18] and the Tevatron collider [19,20], motivating the development of precise perturbative predictions [21][22][23][24][25][26][27][28][29][30][31][32][33]. The large cross section for Wboson production provides greater sensitivity to the VBF topology and to the electroweak production of W j j (electroweak W j j or EW W j j) than corresponding measurements of Z -or Higgs-boson production. The VBF process is inseparable from other electroweak W j j processes, so it is not measured directly; sensitivity to the VBF production mechanism is quantified by determining constraints on operator coefficients in an effective Lagrangian approach [34]. The classes of electroweak diagrams constituting the signal are shown in Fig. 1  [35] and contain at least three vertices where an electroweak gauge boson connects to a pair of fermions. Diboson production, where the final-state quarks result from the decay of an schannel gauge boson, is not shown and is considered as a background; it is small for the VBF topology defined in the analysis. The large background from a W boson associated with strongly produced jets is shown in Fig. 2 and has only two electroweak vertices. This background has O(10) times the yield of the signal process, and can interfere with the signal. This interference is suppressed because only a small subset of the background diagrams have the same initial and final state as the signal.",

Two final-state partons with p T > 20 GeV are required for the signal. A generator-level suppression is applied in the background generation to enhance events with one parton with p T > 80 GeV and a second parton with p T > 60 GeV, and the mass of the pair larger than 500 GeV. Parton momentum distributions are modelled using the CT10 [60] set of parton distribution functions (PDFs). The QCD factorization and renormalization scales are set to the W -boson mass for the sample with jets produced via the electroweak interaction. For the sample with strongly produced jets, the hard-process scale is also the W -boson mass while the QCD emission scales are set with the multiscaleimproved NLO (MiNLO) procedure [61] to improve the modelling and reduce the scale dependence. Uncertainties due to missing higher-order contributions are estimated by doubling and halving the factorization and renormalization scales independently, but keeping their ratio within the range 0.5-2.0. Uncertainties due to parton distribution functions are estimated using CT10 eigenvector variations rescaled to 68% confidence level, and an uncertainty due to the parton shower and hadronization model is taken from the difference between predictions using the Pythia8 and Herwig++ [62,63] generators. Measured particle-level differential distributions are also compared to the Sherpa (v. 1.4) [64] generation of QCD+EW W j j production at leading-order accuracy, including interference. An uncertainty due to the neglect of interference in the EW W j j measurement is estimated using this sample and individual Sherpa QCD and EW W j j samples. The individual samples are also used to model the small contribution from W \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd decays. Measured distributions of QCD+EW W j j production are compared to the combined QCD+EW and to the QCD W j j samples, the latter to demonstrate the effect of the EW W j j process. The QCD W j j sample is a W + (n)-parton prediction with n \u2264 4 partons with p T > 15 GeV produced via QCD interactions. The EW W j j sample has two partons produced via electroweak vertices, and up to one additional parton produced by QCD interactions. The CKKW matching scheme [65] is used to remove the overlap between different parton multiplicities at the matrix-element level. The predictions use the CT10 PDFs and the default parameter values for simulating the underlying event. Renormalization and factorization scales are set using the standard dynamical scale scheme in Sherpa. The interference uncertainty is cross-checked with the Madgraph [28] generator interfaced to Pythia8.",

The matrix gives transition probabilities from particle level to reconstruction level, and Bayes' theorem is employed to calculate the inverse probabilities.

For measurements of combined QCD+EW W j j production, the jet energy scale and resolution uncertainties dominate the total uncertainty except in regions where statistical uncertainties are significant. The unfolding uncertainty is typically relevant in these regions and in regions dominated by QCD W j j production where the statistical uncertainties are small. In measurements of EW W j j production, uncertainties in the modelling of strong W j j production are particularly important at low dijet invariant mass, where the EW W j j signal purity is lowest. Interference uncertainties become dominant at low dijet rapidity separation but are otherwise not the leading contribution to the total uncertainty. A recent study [81] of interference in Z +jets VBF topologies, incorporating NLO electroweak corrections, predicted similar behaviour. For the bulk of the EW W j j distributions, the leading sources of uncertainty are statistical, QCD W j j modelling, and jet energy scale and resolution, and contribute roughly equally.",

These topological features are studied using the distributions of the jet multiplicity in the gap, the fraction of events with no jets with the gap, and the rapidity of the lepton and jets relative to the gap. Figure 20 shows the normalized differential cross section as a function of the number of p T > 30 GeV jets emitted into the rapidity gap for progressively increasing M j j thresholds. In the lowest invariant-mass fiducial region, strong W j j production dominates and predictions from Powheg + Pythia8, Sherpa, and hej all describe the data well. As the dijet invariant mass threshold is increased, the differences in shape between predictions with and without the EW W j j contribution become apparent. The corresponding differential measurements for EW W j j production are shown in Fig. 21 for the inclusive regions with M j j > 1.0 and 2.0 TeV. The measured fraction of EW W j j events with no additional central jets is higher than that of QCD+EW W j j events, as also demonstrated in Table 8. The table shows that the measured zero-jet fraction, frequently referred to as the jet-veto efficiency, is consistent with the Powheg + Pythia8 QCD+EW W j j prediction for progressively increasing M j j . As M j j increases the relative contribution of the EW W j j process increases substantially. Jet centrality is related to the number of jets in the rapidity gap, as events with C j < 0.5 have a jet within the gap. Figure 22 shows good agreement between the predictions and data in the QCD+EW W j j differential cross section weighted by the mean number of gap jets. Since the rate for additional jet production is low in EW W j j production, there are too few events to perform a measurement of the jet centrality distribution for this process.",

The transverse momentum distribution of the leading jet, shown in Fig. 24, has a substantial correlation with the momentum transfer in t-channel events. The QCD+EW W j j measurements are globally well described by Powheg + Pythia8, while predictions from Sherpa and hej both show a harder spectrum than observed in data. For EW W j j production the Powheg + Pythia8 and Sherpa predictions give a harder spectrum than observed in the data, particularly in the higher purity regions (Fig. 25). The overestimation of rates at high jet p T may be reduced by the inclusion of NLO electroweak corrections [66].",
