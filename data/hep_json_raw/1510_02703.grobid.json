The analysis is based on the full set of data collected in 2009 using a graphite target with a thickness of 4 % of a nuclear interaction length. Inelastic and production cross sections as well as spectra of \u03c0 \u00b1 , K \u00b1 , p, K 0 S and \u039b are measured with high precision. These measurements are essential for improved calculations of the initial neutrino fluxes in the T2K long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment in Japan. A comparison of the NA61/SHINE measurements with predictions of several hadroproduction models is presented.",

Hadron production measurements in p + C [5,6] and \u03c0 + C interactions are performed which are required to improve calculations of neutrino fluxes for the T2K/J-PARC [7] and Fermilab neutrino experiments [8] as well as for simulations of cosmic-ray air showers in the Pierre Auger and KASCADE experiments [9,10]. The programme on strong interactions investigates p + p [11], p + Pb and nucleus-nucleus collisions at SPS energies, to study the onset of deconfinement and to search for the critical point of strongly interacting matter [12,13].",

Neutrino oscillations are probed by comparing the neutrino event rates and spectra measured in SK to predictions of a Monte-Carlo (MC) simulation based on flux calculations and near detector measurements. Until the NA61/SHINE data were available, these flux calculations were based on hadron production models tuned to sparse available data, resulting in systematic uncertainties which are large and difficult to evaluate. Direct mea-surements of particle production rates in p + C interactions allow for more precise and reliable estimates [17]. Precise predictions of neutrino fluxes are also crucial for neutrino cross section measurements with the T2K near detector, see e.g. Refs. [22][23][24].",

Only parts relevant for the 2009 running period are briefly described here. The NA61/SHINE experiment has greatly profited from the long development of the CERN proton and ion sources, the accelerator chain, as well as the H2 beamline of the CERN North Area. Numerous components of the NA61/SHINE setup were inherited from its predecessors, in particular, the last one -the NA49 experiment [29]. The detector is built arround five Time Projection Chambers (TPCs), as shown in Fig. 3. Two Vertex TPCs (VTPC-1 and VTPC-2) are placed in the magnetic field produced by two superconducting dipole magnets and two Main-TPCs Fig. 3 The schematic layout of the NA61/SHINE spectrometer (horizontal cut, not to scale). The beam and trigger detector configuration used for data taking in 2009 is shown in the inset. The chosen coordinate system is drawn on the plot: its origin lies in the middle of the VTPC-2, on the beam axis. The nominal beam direction is along the z axis. The magnetic field bends charged particle trajectories in the x-z (horizontal) plane. Positively charged particles are bent towards the top of the plot. The drift direction in the TPCs is along the y (vertical) axis (MTPC-L and MTPC-R) are located downstream symmetrically with respect to the beamline. An additional small TPC is placed between VTPC-1 and VTPC-2, covering the veryforward region, and is referred to as the GAP TPC (GTPC). The GTPC allows to extend the kinematic coverage at forward production angles compared to the previously published results from the 2007 pilot run. The TPCs are filled with Ar:CO 2 gas mixtures in proportions 90:10 for the VTPCs and the GTPC, and 95:5 for the MTPCs.",

To avoid this effect all the events with at least one pileup beam particle within \u00b14 \u00b5s around the triggering beam particle were rejected. In Fig. 6 the distribution of the ADC signal is shown for a sample of events tagged by the beam trigger T beam . If a beam proton does not interact in the target, and thus hits S4, the ADC counts will be larger than 70. If both the beam and interaction trigger conditions are satisfied T beam \u2227 T int , the ADC signal corresponds to the pedestal and will be distributed between 56 and 70 counts (\u0394 adc ). The efficiency of the S4 counter as a part of the T int trigger is defined as the ratio between the number of ADC counts in the \u0394 adc interval for T beam \u2227 T int events and the total number of ADC counts in the \u0394 adc interval for T beam events. The measured ratio is (99.8 \u00b1 0.2) %. This estimate of the S4 efficiency was crosschecked using the GTPC. Beam track segments reconstructed in the GTPC were extrapolated to the z position of S4. The fraction of the number of extrapolations hitting S4 and also satisfying T int provides another estimate of the efficiency of S4. Both results were found to be in agreement.

The detector systematic uncertainty of 2009 is significantly smaller. It is a consequence of the fact that in 2009 the beam triggers were recorded by DAQ simultaneously with physics triggers. Thus the same selection cuts (see Sect. 3.2) could be applied to all triggers. In contrast, during the 2007 run the beam information was recorded by scalers which were not read out by the main DAQ. As a consequence, event-by-event quality selection was not possible [34]. Instead, special runs were taken with the beam trigger to estimate biases. It had to be assumed that the effect of the selection was stable over the whole data taking period. On the other hand, the statistical uncertainty on \u03c3 trig from the 2009 data (see Eq. (10)) is slightly larger because of the smaller number of recorded T beam triggers. The fraction of out-of-target interaction background in the sample of the target inserted events is",

(iii) Reconstruction algorithm: Two different primary interaction vertex reconstruction algorithms were used, either fitting all three coordinates or fixing the zcoordinate to the survey position. The uncertainty connected to the algorithm is from 5 to 8 % for both analyses. (iv) Quality cuts: All quality cuts were varied independently within a range given in Ref. [42] and the uncertainty connected to this source was found to reach up to 10 % (5 %) for K 0 S (\u039b). (v) Kinematic cuts: As for the previous source of uncertainty, all cuts were varied and the resulting uncertainty is up to 10 % (7 %) for K 0 S (\u039b).",

The energy loss information can be used in the full momentum range of NA61/SHINE. The ToF-F detector, which is installed about 13 m downstream of the target (see Fig. 3), contributes to particle identification up to 8 GeV/c. The distribution of m 2 , the square of the mass calculated from the ToF-F measurement and the fitted track parameters, is shown for positively charged particles as a function of momentum in Fig. 4. Simultaneous use of these two sources of PID information is particularly important in the momentum range from 1 to 4 GeV/c where the dE/dx bands of charged hadrons cross over (see Fig. 5). Thus the dE/dx measurement alone would not be enough to identify particles with sufficient precision and tof is especially important to resolve this ambiguity.",

Basically, these are regions where the reconstruction capability is limited by the ToF-F acceptance, by the magnet aperture or by the presence of uninstrumented regions in the VTPCs. To exclude these regions a cut on the hadron azimuthal angle \u03c6 was applied. Since the spectrometer acceptance drops quickly with increase of the polar angle \u03b8 of the particle, typical cut intervals for \u03c6 at low and high \u03b8 were \u00b160 \u2022 and \u00b16 \u2022 , respectively. (ii) the track must have an associated ToF-F hit. Since particles can decay or interact before reaching the detector, the z position of the last reconstructed TPC cluster of a track should be reasonably close to the ToF-F wall, thus a cut z last > 6 m was applied to all tracks. This requirement is especially important for K \u00b1 (c\u03c4 \u2248 3.7 m) many of which decay before reaching ToF-F. Pions have a higher chance to reach the ToF-F (c\u03c4 \u2248 7.8 m) also due to their lower mass and thus larger Lorentz factor.

At low momenta the ToF-F resolution ensures an unambiguous particle identification, thus small deviations of the dE/dx distribution from a single Gaussian in general are not important. A deviation has a significant effect only for momenta above 3 GeV/c. For pions it steadily increases up to 2 % at p = 20 GeV/c. However for kaons, the uncertainty is an order of magnitude larger: up to 20 % for K + at high momenta. (ii) Hadron loss To ensure a high quality match of tracks and ToF-F hits the last point of a track should be within 1.6 m from the ToF-F wall (z last > 6 m). This implies that a track segment is reconstructed in the MTPC-L or MTPC-R detectors. Possible imperfections in the description of the spectrometer can introduce a difference in the acceptance and reconstruction efficiency (merging track segments between VTPC-2 and MTPC-L/R) between simulation and real data which can be important for the reconstruction of long tracks.",

            "text": "To check how sensitive the results are to the z last cut, it was relaxed down to z last > \u22121.5 m for pions and z last > \u22123 m for kaons. The difference in the resulting final spectra was assigned as the systematic uncertainty. It reaches up to 2 % at 1 GeV/c and drops quickly with increasing momentum. (iii) Reconstruction efficiency To estimate the uncertainty of the reconstruction efficiency the following track selection criteria were varied: the minimum number of points measured on the track, the azimuthal angle and the impact parameter cuts. Also results were compared which were obtained with two independent track topologies, different algorithms for merging track segments from different TPCs into global tracks, and with two different algorithms for the primary vertex reconstruction. It was found that the influence of such changes is small compared to the statistical uncertainties. The corresponding systematic uncertainty was estimated to be 2 %. (iv) Forward acceptance As stated in Sect. 2, the GTPC detector was used for the first time in the reconstruction algorithms within NA61/SHINE. The GTPC increases the number of reconstructed tracks mainly for smaller angles, \u03b8 < 40 mrad, and thus allows finer momentum binning in the forward region \u03b8 < 20 mrad. The estimate of the systematic uncertainty in the forward region is based on the comparison of results obtained with and without the GTPC included in the reconstruction algorithms and by varying the required number of GTPC clusters in the analysis. The latter takes into account inefficiencies of the GTPC electronic readout which were not included in the simulations. The difference of spectra obtained with and without using the GTPC information in the reconstruction was found to be 4 % up to \u03b8 < 20 mrad and about 3 % for 20 < \u03b8 < 40 mrad. The variation of the required number of GTPC clusters between 4 and 6 resulted in changes of up to 4 % for 0 < \u03b8 < 10 mrad and up to 2 % for 10 < \u03b8 < 20 mrad for tracks with momentum p > 12 GeV/c. In this region the majority of tracks do not traverse the VTPC-1/2 detectors and thus the reconstruction of the track segment in the magnetic field totally relies on the GTPC. (v) ToF-F reconstruction The ToF-F reconstruction efficiency was estimated using a sample of events with very strict selection requiring no incoming beam particle within a \u00b120 \u00b5s time window around the triggered interaction. The inefficiency was found to vary from 4 % in the central region to a fraction of a percent in the ToF-F slabs far away from the beamline. This variation correlates with the higher particle density in the nearto-beam region where several particles can hit a single slab, thus contributing to inefficiency. A value of 50 % of the inefficiency correction was assigned as a conservative limit to this source of systematic uncertainty. (vi) Secondary interactions and non-\u039b feed-down corrections As in the case of the dE/dx (Sect. 4.5) and h \u2212 (Sect. 4.6) approaches, the important contribution to the systematic uncertainty at low momenta comes from the uncertainty of the simulation-based correction for secondary interactions and weak decays of strange particles (excluding \u039b hyperons). Following arguments described in Ref. [5] an uncertainty of 30 % of the correction value was assigned for both of these sources. (vii) \u039b feed-down correction The correction for the feeddown to pions and protons originating from \u039b decays was calculated separately based on measured \u039b spectra (see Sect. 4.4.1). The uncertainty assigned to this correction was estimated to be 30 % which is an upper limit on the overall uncertainty of the measured \u039b spectra. Figures 16 and 17 show a breakdown of the total systematic uncertainty in the tof -dE/dx analysis for the example of the angular interval [20,40] mrad.",

In case the track had less than 12 hits in the VTPCs, at least 4 hits were required in the GTPC to ensure a long enough track segment in the first part of the spectrometer. This is important for a good determination of the track parameters, particularly for tracks that start in the GTPC and continue to the MTPCs. A selection based on the dE/dx of the track was introduced (not used in the analysis of the 2007 data) to improve the purity of the track sample by rejecting the large electron contamination at low \u03b8 angles. This was done to remove, in particular, electrons emitted by beam protons (\u03b4-rays) passing through the NA61/SHINE detector that are not accounted for in the simulations. The effect was not prominent in the 2007 data because the intensity of the beam was significantly lower than in 2009. The separation between electrons and mostly pions was found to be sufficient for all \u03b8 bins when a momentum-dependent cut on dE/dx was applied for each \u03b8 bin separately.

The correction includes the contribution of primary K \u2212 andp, the contribution from weak decays of strange particles and secondary interactions in the target as well as in the detector material.

            "text": "(i) Feed-down The uncertainty related to the correction for secondary interactions and for weak decays of strange particles remains the dominant contribution to the systematic uncertainty at low momentum. For both of these sources a 30 % error was assigned as described in Ref. [5]. The significant reduction of the uncertainty, compared to the 2007 analysis, comes from the use of new NA61/SHINE measurements of \u039b production (see Sect. 4.4.1 for more details) and the removal of electrons at low \u03b8 and low momentum. (ii) Forward acceptance The impact of the GTPC detector was evaluated following the procedure described in Sect. 4.4.2. The systematic uncertainty deduced from the difference of the spectra obtained with the reconstruction algorithms with and without use of the GTPC was found to be 4 % for 0 < \u03b8 < 10 mrad and 2 % for 10 < \u03b8 < 40 mrad in the overlapping acceptance regions. The variation of the number of hits required for tracks starting in the GTPC resulted in a systematic uncertainty of up to 4-5 % for the most forward region \u03b8 < 20 mrad and at momenta p > 5 GeV/c. (iii) K \u2212 andp contamination The admixture of K \u2212 and p was estimated from simulations with the Venus4.12 model as the primary event generator and was assigned a systematic uncertainty of 20 %. The contribution of K \u2212 andp varies with momentum from 5 to 10 % at low \u03b8 angles. For \u03b8 > 100 mrad it increases with momentum and varies from 5 to 20 %. (iv) Reconstruction efficiency The reconstruction efficiency was evaluated by comparing results for different reconstruction algorithms used in the experiment. Differences of about 2 % were found. Since no dependence was observed on momentum and angle \u03b8 this value was assigned to the systematic uncertainty. (v) Track selection method The uncertainty was estimated by varying the following selections: required minimum total number of points on the track, dE/dx cuts for electron removal, and maximally allowed impact parameter. The requirement on the number of points on the  [20,40] mrad angular interval as an example track was changed by 10 % from the nominal value of 30 and the corresponding uncertainty was found to be up to 1 %. The uncertainty associated with the cut to reject electrons was estimated by varying the cut value in dE/dx for each of the \u03b8 bins by \u00b13 %. The separation of electrons and mostly pions is good, so the impact on the spectra is negligible compared to that of varying the requirement on the number of points and no additional uncertainty was assigned. To test the sensitivity to the impact parameter cut, the analysis was repeated without the cut and the effect was found to be negligible. Figure 21 shows a breakdown of the total systematic uncertainty for \u03c0 \u2212 as a function of momentum in the angular interval [20,40] mrad as an example.",

In order to avoid uncertainties related to the different treatment of quasi-elastic interactions and to the absence of predictions for inclusive cross sections, spectra are normalized to the mean particle multiplicity in all production interactions. For the data, the normalization relies on the p + C inclusive production cross section \u03c3 prod which was found to be 230.7 mb (see Sect. 3.5). The production cross section is calculated from the inelastic cross section by subtracting the quasi-elastic contribution. Therefore production processes are defined as those in which only new hadrons are present in the final state. Details of the cross section analysis procedure can be found in Sect. 3 and in Refs.

Within the corresponding systematic uncertainties, the results of various methods were found to be in a good agreement as shown in Figs. 22 and 23 for \u03c0 + and \u03c0 \u2212 , respectively. In order to present a single spectrum for positively and negatively changed pions, the results were combined. For \u03c0 + mesons, where there is complementarity of acceptance for different analysis techniques results from the dE/dx analysis are used for all angular intervals up to 420 mrad in the momentum range below 1 GeV/c. The momentum region above 1 GeV/c is covered by the tof -dE/dx analysis for angular intervals up to 360 mrad. In case of \u03c0 \u2212 mesons, results of the h \u2212 analysis are used in the full angular range up to 420 mrad since they provide the smallest total uncertainty in the region of the overlap between methods. The final spectra are shown for \u03c0 + in Fig. 27 and for \u03c0 \u2212 in Fig. 28. Numerical results are given in Tables 4  and 5 for \u03c0 + and \u03c0 \u2212 , respectively. Thus, the final results span a broad kinematic range. When comparing the new \u03c0 \u00b1 results to the previously published measurements based on the 2007 data [5] one should note that the present results are shown in the form of d 2 \u03c3/(dpd\u03b8), while the form d\u03c3/(dp) was used in previous publications Refs. [5,6]. The deviations between the two data sets are consistent within the quoted errors and are distributed uniformly over the phase space. Thus, the new measurements confirm the published 2007 results which were questioned in Ref. [57]. Both the statistical and the total systematic uncertainties are considerably smaller for the new 2009 results as shown for the angular interval [60,100] mrad for \u03c0 + in Fig. 24 and for \u03c0 \u2212 in Fig. 25. At low momentum systematic uncertainties dominate whereas at higher momentum the statistical uncertainty gives the largest contribution to the total uncertainty.",

The Epos1.99 and GiBUU1.6 models show good agreement with the measured K \u00b1 spectra.

These data are crucial for predictions of the initial neutrino fluxes in the T2K long baseline neutrino oscillation experiment in Japan. Furthermore, they provide important input to improve hadron production models needed for the interpretation of air showers initiated by ultra high energy cosmic particles. The measurements were performed with the large acceptance NA61/SHINE spectrometer at the CERN SPS. A set of data collected with a 4 % \u03bb I isotropic graphite target during the high-statistics NA61/SHINE run in 2009 was used for the analysis. The measured spectra are compared with predictions of several hadron production models. None of the models provides a satisfactory description of all the spectra.",
