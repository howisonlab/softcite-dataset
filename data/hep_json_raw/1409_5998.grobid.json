The four systems are ideal laboratories for studying the discrete symmetries T and CPT. The properties of time reversal T are discussed in classical and quantum mechanics. T violation in K 0 K 0 transitions has been observed 1970 independent of assuming CPT symmetry by using the Bell-Steinberger unitarity relation. Improvements of this observation are reviewed including the latest results from 2013. They show with high significance that CP violation in K 0 K 0 transitions is only T violation without any CPT violation. Transitions in the other three systems do not show CP violation so far and, therefore, neither T nor CPT violation. The large observed CP violation in B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8K 0 decays is presented to be compatible with only T and no CPT violation, the same for the significant but very small CP violation in decays K 0 \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0, I = 2.",

Around experiments showed that two interactions are fully symmetric and that the weak interaction is only symmetric under Poincar\u00e9 transformations excluding P and C. These two symmetries are maximally broken, up to 1964 in such a way that CP and T were assumed to be perfect symmetries. Since C, P and CP are described by unitary transformations, strong and electromagnetic interactions conserve the quantum numbers C, P and CP, whereas the weak interaction conserves only the quantum number CP and neither C nor P. The transformations T and CPT are antiunitary; therefore, there exist no conserved quantum numbers for them in any of the three interactions. All three interactions could be assumed to be symmetric under the transformations T and CPT.",

Since CP = CP T \u00d7T , the symmetries T or CPT or both had also to be broken. Around 1968 it became clear that CP symmetry is dominantly broken in K 0 K 0 transitions and unmeasurably small in the decay amplitudes. Measurements of all four CP-violating parameters in K 0 \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0 decays and measured limits on CP violation in all other K 0 decays allowed in 1970 to conclude that only T symmetry is significantly violated in K 0 K 0 transitions and that CPT symmetry therein is valid within errors.",

            "text": "The first identified meson was a positive Kaon with a mass of (500 \u00b1 60) MeV, found in 1944 by L. Leprince-Ringuet and M. Lh\u00e9ritier [2] in cosmic-ray observations using a triggered cloud chamber, three years before the discovery of the charged \u03c0 meson [3]. The first observation of a neutral Kaon was reported by G. D. Rochester and C. C. Butler [4], again using cosmic-ray events in a cloud chamber. With the advance of experiments at proton accelerators after 1950, a puzzle appeared when comparing \u03c0 + , \u03c0 0 , \u03c0 \u2212 with masses around 140 MeV, and K + , K 0 , K \u2212 with masses around 500 MeV. The heavier mesons were called \u03b8 when decaying into two and \u03c4 when decaying into three pions. All these mesons were produced with comparably large rates in proton-proton collisions, and with the exception of the \u03c0 0 they decayed with comparably long lifetimes. Since the lightest charged meson cannot decay by strong interactions, its lifetime was understood to be similar to that of the muon owing to weak interactions. Puzzling was the observation that the K mesons also decayed with long weak-interaction lifetimes in spite of their abundant production by strong interactions; strong-interaction decays with very short lifetimes into two or three pions are not forbidden by conservation of energy and momentum. The solutions of the puzzle were found around 1953 by A. Pais, M. Gell-Mann and K. Nishijima by introducing the concept of \"associated production\" [5], e. g. pp \u2192 ppK + K \u2212 , and of the quantum number \"strangeness\" [6,7], e. g. S(K + ) = +1, S(K \u2212 ) = \u22121, which is conserved in strong and violated in weak interactions. An important step in 1953 was the discovery that \u03b8 + and \u03c4 + are identical, also \u03b8 0 and \u03c4 0 , thanks to the invention of the Dalitz plot [8] demonstrating that the three-pion state in \u03c4 + decays had spin J = 0. Parity conservation led to J P = 0 \u2212 for the \u03c4 + and J P = 0 + for the \u03b8 + , but the \u03c4 and \u03b8 masses were equal and also their lifetimes. The increasing number of observed \u03c4 and \u03b8 decays led T. D. Lee and C. N. Yang [9] to the hypothesis in 1956 that parity symmetry is broken in weak interactions. This was quickly confirmed by two experiments at Columbia University on 15 January 1957, that of L. M. Lederman's group [10] in the decay chain \u03c0 + \u2192 \u00b5 + \u03bd \u2192 (e + \u03bd\u03bd)\u03bd and that of C. S. Wu et al [11] in \u03b2 decays of polarized 60 Co nuclei. Neutral Kaons have a second very strange property, a nonexponential decay law, predicted in 1955 by M. Gell-Mann and A. Pais [12]. Starting from the dominant decay K 0 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and its known rate \u0393 1 , they argued that C symmetry (charge conjugation) requires the existence of the K 0 meson and the decay K 0 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 with the same rate \u0393 1 . Transitions K 0 \u2194 \u03c0\u03c0 \u2194 K 0 with virtual \u03c0\u03c0 pairs should then occur with a transition rate comparable to \u0393 1 , and all linear superpositions",

Baldo-Ceolin et al. [16] reported a nuclear-emulsion experiment in a K + beam, where K 0 mesons with S = +1 from a charge-exchange reaction such as K + n \u2192 K 0 p produced \u039b hyperons with S = \u22121 in a reaction such as K 0 p \u2192 \u039b\u03c0 + . This was one of the first clear demonstrations of the transition K 0 \u2192 K 0 . In 1961 R. H. Good et al. [17] further investigated this transition by passing a neutral Kaon beam far from its production target through a metal plate and observing the time dependence of K \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decays closely behind the plate. Owing to the two-state nature of neutral Kaons, the time-dependent transitions K 0 \u2194 K 0 cannot be described by a single \"transition rate\". There are two coherent contributions, the mass and width differences \u2206m = m(K 0 2 ) \u2212 m(K 0 1 ) and \u2206\u0393 = \u0393 2 \u2212 \u0393 1 , as described in detail in Section 4. In addition to |\u2206\u0393| \u2248 0.9 \u00d7 \u0393 1 from Ref.

Adair [18] found an effect in 1963 which they called \"anomalous regeneration\". At the limit of significance, a larger rate of \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decays was observed in a beam of neutral Kaons behind a liquidhydrogen regenerator than that expected from the estimated regeneration rate. The more precise and famous experiment of J. H. Christenson, J. W. Cronin, V. L. Fitch and R. Turlay [19] discovered one year later with high significance that this larger rate occurs also in a near-to-vacuum material, gaseous helium. The influence of regeneration was negligible; long-living Kaons in the assumed CP eigenstate K 0 2 with CP = \u22121 decayed into the final state \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 with CP = +1. This evident non-conservation of CP symmetry could still have two origins: the decay dynamics of K 0 2 \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0 or the transition dynamics of K 0 \u2194 K 0 generating a long-living state which is not a CP eigenstate. In 1967 the experiment of J. Steinberger's group [20] gave the answer that the second origin is dominating, by observing that the decay rate of the long-living state into \u03c0 \u2212 e + \u03bd is larger than that into \u03c0 + e \u2212 \u03bd.",

This motion can be recorded together with a clock showing the time for the motion from the start to the end point. A video recorder allows to replay the recorded movie in the backward direction, as shown in Fig. 3. Even if the motion of the ball looks familiar to the viewer, the clock tells him that this process does not take place in his world. The replayed movie shows an unobservable process; time does never run backwards. It is, however, possible to observe the reversed motion in the real world: we have to start it at the end point of the original motion with a velocity vector equal to the opposite of the final velocity of the original motion, as shown in Fig. 4. This observable motion with forward-running time is called \"reversed motion\". The operation with starting at the end point and reversing the velocity is called \"motion reversal\", and the comparison of Figs. 4 and 2 shows \"motion-reversal symmetry\".

About 54 000 events with four converted photons were found by scanning the \u223c 240 000 recorded photographs.

CP and T violations have been seen in the K 0 K 0 system, in transitions and in decays. Since both violations are small, the two mass eigenstates are \"almost CP eigenstates\", the heavier K 0 L has CP \u2248 \u22121. No CP violation has been established in the D 0 D 0 system so far; the expected small effects and the already achieved limits allow the same approximation, the heavier state D 0 h has CP \u2248 +1. In the B 0 B 0 system, no CP violation has been observed in transitions, but there are large CP violations in decays and in the interplay of transitions and decays. Therefore, the two mass eigenstates are no CP eigenstates, not even approximately. The state decaying into \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 (CP = +1) is different from the state decaying into J/\u03c8 K 0 L (also CP = +1), and both are not mass eigenstates.

The parameters \u0393 = (\u0393 h + \u0393 )/2 and \u2206\u0393 = \u0393 h \u2212 \u0393 are obtained from the three time dependences of decays into (approximate) CP eigenstates with CP \u2248 +1 (e. g. K + K \u2212 or J/\u03c8\u03c6), into those with CP \u2248 \u22121 (e. g. J/\u03c8f 0 ), and into summed flavor eigenstates (e. g. the sum of D s + X and D s \u2212 X). The data [13] show a clearly longer lifetime for the CP \u2248 \u22121 than for the CP \u2248 +1 states, and the summed flavor eigenstates show a lifetime in between as expected by their decay law e \u2212\u0393t cosh(\u2206\u0393t/2). Determining the phase-shift differences in final-state interactions of K + K \u2212 pairs in s-and p-waves as function of the K + K \u2212 mass, LHCb [96] found in 2012 that \u2206\u0393 = \u0393 h \u2212 \u0393 < 0. A fit to all three time dependences gives [99] \u0393 = (0.6598 \u00b1 0.0034) \u00d7 10 12 /s , \u2206\u0393 = (\u22120.091 \u00b1 0.009) \u00d7 10 12 /s , \u2206\u0393/\u0393 = \u22120.137 \u00b1 0.013 . (196) Measurements of T violation in B s B s transitions are controversial. Using D s \u00b5X events, Re = A T /4 is measured to be (\u22122.8 \u00b1 1.9 \u00b1 0.4) \u00d7 10 \u22123 by D0 in 2013 [115] and (\u22120.2 \u00b1 1.3 \u00b1 0.9) \u00d7 10 \u22123 by LHCb in 2014 [116]. Both results are compatible with each other and with no T violation. However, D0 has also measured several linear combinations of Re (B s ) and Re (B 0 ) from single-muon and likesign-dimuon events. A combined fit to these data in 2014 [117] deviates from the Standard-Model expectations by 3.6 \u03c3. The expectation for the B 0 system was given below Eq. 184. For the B s system, A. Lenz and U. Nierste [105] obtain an even smaller value of Re = (0.52 \u00b1 0.14) \u00d7 10 \u22125 . More precise data are clearly needed.",

The difference depends on the five parameters Re \u03b4, Im \u03b4, Re , |A f /A f |, Im \u03bb f and also on the sign of Re \u03bb f . The modulus of |\u03bb f | is given by Re and |A f /A f |, and the sign of Re \u03bb f needs to be determined separately. The parameters Re \u03b4 and Im \u03b4 describe CPT violation and Re T violation in transitions. The fourth parameter |A f /A f | describes CPT violation in decays if f is a single state with only one final-state-interaction phase, as discussed in Subsection 3.6. In the following we assume this property of f and discuss possible deviations in Section 8.3. T violation in decays is not observable by Im (A f /A f ) since the amplitudes and also their ratio have no observable phases owing to arbitrary phases of the states |B 0 and |B 0 . The ratio q/p depends on these phases in such a way that the product \u03bb f = qA f /pA f is an observable. T symmetry requires that its phase has to be 0 or \u03c0, i. e. Im \u03bb f = 0; this T-symmetry property in the \"interplay of decay and transitions\" replaces the unobservable T-symmetry property in decays.",

As already discussed in Section 7.2, the parameters Re and Im \u03b4 are determined by rate differences in B 0 B 0 transitions, e. g. using di-lepton events. The two remaining CP-violating parameters Re \u03b4 and Im \u03bb f are determined by the time dependences in Eqs. 204. The product Re \u03bb f Re \u03b4 enters with different signs in the cosine term, and Im \u03bb f with different signs in the sine term of the two time dependences. A combined fit determines both parameters, and a combined fit to the two rates together with the two di-lepton rates determines all five CP-violating parameters and \u2206\u0393. Such a combined fit has been performed with the data of BABAR [103] and Belle [104] using the two final states J/\u03c8K 0 S and J/\u03c8K 0 L . For the signs of \u2206\u0393 and Re \u03b4, it is important to know the sign of Re \u03bb f . This has been determined in the final state J/\u03c8K * 0 [120]. The present best values for \u2206\u0393, Re \u03b4, Im \u03b4 and Re have been given in Section 7.2, see Eqs. 181, 191 and 184.

Unfortunately, the rule is not well tested experimentally. The best experimental limit exists for Im (x \u2212 x) from Im \u03bb f \u2212 + Im \u03bb f + = 0.002 \u00b1 0.047 [99], and it seems that no values for Re x and Re x have been determined so far. But the \u2206S = \u2206b rule is only required for the relation between \u03bb f \u2212 and \u03bb f + , it is irrelevant for the main conclusion of this Section: The data of BABAR [118,121] and Belle [119,122] do not show CPT violation but show large T violation in decays B 0 , B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8K 0 S , J/\u03c8K 0 L . The conclusion of large T-symmetry violation, independent of any assumption on CPT symmetry, is reached quantitatively if the parameters |\u03bb f | and Im \u03bb f are obtained by a fit to the data of the B-mesonfactory experiments BABAR and Belle for the combination of \u2206t > 0 and \u2206t < 0 using Eqs. 208. Both experiments cannot measure t 1 and t 2 owing to the wide spread of \u03a5(4S) production points. However, they can measure well the separation of the two decay points yielding \u2206t = t 2 \u2212 t 1 . The mean values from the final BABAR and Belle fits over the full range \u2212\u221e < \u2206t < \u221e are given in Table 3, where the last line assumes strict validity of \u2206S = \u2206b.

If the first decay is a f \u2212 decay, the other B at that time is in a state which is not allowed to decay into f \u2212 owing to the antisymmetry of the entangled two-particle state; this state is given by B + = (A B 0 \u2212 A B 0 )/ |A| 2 + |A| 2 using the notations in Eq. 210 with x = x = 0, i. e. assuming \u2206S = \u2206b.

A. Kosteleck\u00fd [134], BABAR [135] has searched for a special breakdown of Lorentz invariance by allowing a time-dependent variation of the CPT-violating parameter \u03b4 in B 0 B 0 transitions according to z = \u22122\u03b4 = z 0 + z 1 \u00d7 cos(\u2126t sid + \u03a6) ,",

Fits to the dilepton asymmetry in Eq. 187 give results for z 0 and z 1 which deviate slightly from zero. The significance of the deviation is, however, smaller than 3 \u03c3. No T violation has been observed in strong and electromagnetic interactions. In weak interactions, T violation is well established. In 1970, it has been observed in K 0 K 0 transitions by using unitarity and the existing CP-violation results and limits in all K 0 decay modes; Re (K 0 ) = (1.68 \u00b1 0.30) 10 \u22123 , Eq. 117. This Bell-Steinbergerv unitarity analysis has been repeated many times until recently. Today's best result is Re (K 0 ) = (1.611\u00b10.005) 10 \u22123 , Eq. 137. The result has been confirmed in 1998 by a direct motion-reversal observation, comparing the rates of K 0 \u2192 K 0 and K 0 \u2192 K 0 , independent of unitarity but assuming CPT symmetry in the semileptonic K 0 decay amplitudes, Re (K 0 ) = (1.55 \u00b1 0.42) 10 \u22123 , Eq. 127. No T violation has been observed in D 0 D 0 , B 0 B 0 and B s B s transitions, but there are good prospects that the experiments LHCb and Belle-II will reach a sensitivity on Re (B 0 ) on the level of the expected Standard-Model T violation, Eq. 185. T violation has also been observed in weak decay amplitudes: T is violated in K 0 \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0, I = 2 decays, where the phase of / 0 is incompatible with T symmetry as shown in Fig. 11. And T is violated in B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8 K 0 decays, observed in 2001 since the CP-violating parameter \u03bb f in these decays is also T-violating, see Section 8.2. Entanglement of B 0 and B 0 states in \u03a5(4S) decays allowed a direct demonstration of motion-reversal violation with these decays one decade later, see Section 8.4.",
