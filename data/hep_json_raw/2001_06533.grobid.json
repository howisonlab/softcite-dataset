The existence of four excited \u039b 0 b states: \u039b 0 b (5912) 0 , \u039b 0 b (5920) 0 , \u039b 0 b (6146) 0 , and \u039b 0 b (6152) 0 in the \u039b 0 b \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 mass spectrum is confirmed, and their masses are measured. The \u039b 0 b \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 mass distribution exhibits a broad excess of events in the region of 6040-6100 MeV, whose origin cannot be discerned with the present data.",

            "text": "Studies of excited baryonic states are an important aspect of hadron spectroscopy and help to shed light on the mechanisms responsible for dynamics of quarks and baryon formation. In particular, spectroscopy of baryons that contain a heavy-flavor quark, such as the \u039b 0 b baryon, can test predictions of heavy-quark effective theory [1]. A number of theoretical calculations exist for various orbital and radial excitations of the ground state baryons containing a b quark [2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16], including those of the \u039b 0 b baryon. In general, there are a number of excited \u039b 0 b baryon states predicted in the 5.9-6.4 GeV mass range. However, predictions are very diverse in terms of the specific mass spectrum and do not point to any common narrow mass region in which to search for these excited states. As an additional complication, the widths and the production cross sections of various excited states are generally unknown. This situation makes experimental searches for excited heavy-quark baryons both challenging and important for testing various theoretical models.",

The L1 trigger used in the analysis required at least two muons. The second level, known as the high-level trigger (HLT), consists of a farm of processors running a version of the full event reconstruction software optimized for fast processing, and reduces the event rate to around 1 kHz before data storage. The set of HLT algorithms used in the analysis requires two opposite-sign (OS) muons with various pseudorapidity \u03b7 and transverse momentum p T thresholds, compatible with being produced in the dimuon decays of J/\u03c8 or \u03c8(2S) mesons.

The significances have been evaluated with the likelihood-ratio technique by applying the one-and twopeak signal hypotheses. The likelihood ratios are evaluated using an asymptotic formula [37,38]. The means and resolution parameters of the two peaks are allowed to vary in the fit within the Gaussian constraints from Ref.  Using the likelihood-ratio technique and the one-versus twopeak hypotheses, the presence of two peaks has a statistical significance of 0.4\u03c3 , indicating that the data are also consistent with a single peak at 6150 MeV. For the double-peak hypothesis, the natural widths of the two states are allowed to vary in the fit within the Gaussian constraints from the LHCb measurement [22]. In the single-peak hypothesis, the mass and the natural width of the signal peak are free parameters of the fit. In both cases, the mass resolution is allowed to float in the fit within its Gaussian uncertainty estimated from simulation. The local statistical significance of the single-peak hypothesis with respect to the background-only hypothesis is found to be over 6\u03c3 in the baseline fit, and varies between 5.4 and 6.5\u03c3 with the changes in the fit range and the model used to estimate the systematic uncertainties, as detailed in Section 6.

The latter state was confirmed by the CDF Collaboration [18] soon thereafter with the mass measured to be M(\u039b 0 b (5920) 0 ) = 5919.22 \u00b1 0.76 MeV. The precision of these measurements was limited by the large uncertainty in the \u039b 0 b mass at the time; the current world-average values M(\u039b 0 b (5912) 0 ) = 5912.20 \u00b1 0.21 MeV and M(\u039b 0 b (5920) 0 ) = 5919.92 \u00b1 0.19 MeV [19] are based on the updated \u039b 0 b mass measurement [20,21]. Recently, the LHCb experiment has also presented an observation of two narrow higher-mass states in the \u039b 0 b \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 spectrum, with the following masses and widths [22]: M(\u039b 0 b (6146) 0 ) = 6146.17 \u00b1 0.43 MeV, (\u039b 0 b (6146) 0 ) = 2.9 \u00b1 1.3 MeV, and M(\u039b 0 b (6152) 0 ) = 6152.51 \u00b1 0.38 MeV, (\u039b 0 b (6152) 0 ) = 2.1 \u00b1 0.9 MeV. In this Letter, a study of the \u039b 0 b \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 invariant mass distribution in the 5900-6400 GeV range by the CMS Collaboration is reported. Both the \u039b 0 b (5912) 0 and \u039b 0 b (5920) 0 states near the kinematic threshold are confirmed and their masses are measured. In addition, the \u039b 0 b \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 distribution is investigated in the higher-mass region and signals consistent with the \u039b 0 b (6146) 0 and \u039b 0 b (6152) 0 states are observed. The ground state baryon \u039b 0 b is reconstructed via its decays into the J/\u03c8 and \u03c8(2S) channels.

The PV is then refitted after removing the tracks associated with the and either the J/\u03c8 or \u03c8(2S) candidates. The decay length of the \u039b 0 b candidate in the transverse plane, L xy , is computed as the twodimensional distance between the PV and the \u039b 0 b decay vertex, and is required to exceed three times its uncertainty. This selection helps to suppress the combinatorial background. In addition, the transverse momentum of the \u039b 0 b candidate is required to be well aligned with the transverse displacement vector: cos \u03b1 > 0.99, where \u03b1 is the angle between the projections on the plane trans-verse to the beams of the \u039b 0 b candidate momentum and of the vector connecting the PV with the \u039b 0 b decay vertex. The numbers of \u039b 0 b signal candidates after these requirements are about 39 000, 3400, and 4300 for the J/\u03c8 , \u03c8(2S) (\u03c8(2S) \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 ), and \u03c8(2S) (\u03c8(2S) \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) channels, respectively.

Combinations of a \u039b 0 b candidate with two prompt same-sign (SS) pions are used as a control channel and form the SS control region, as opposed to the OS signal region. The higher-p T pion of the pair is labeled \u03c0 \u00b1 1 and the lower-p T pion \u03c0 \u00b1 2 .

To check if it can be due to some other state decaying into the \u039b 0 b K \u00b1 \u03c0 \u2213 channels, the\u039b 0 b K\u03c0 invariant mass distributions are obtained by substituting the pion mass with the kaon mass. No significant enhancements over the smooth background are found. The m \u039b 0 b \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 background distribution is found to be in agreement between the SS and OS regions in the simulation and does not show any enhancement in the 6000-6100 MeV mass region. The two-dimensional distributions of the \u039b 0 b \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 mass versus the \u039b 0 b \u03c0 + and \u039b 0 b \u03c0 \u2212 masses from data are shown in the supplemental material [URL will be inserted by publisher]. If the \u039b 0 b \u03c0 \u00b1 invariant mass ranges corresponding to the \u2212 b , + b , * \u2212 b , and * + b baryons are vetoed, the SS and OS mass distributions in data are found to be in agreement in the region below 6100 MeV and do not exhibit a broad enhancement, as shown in the supplemental material [URL will be inserted by publisher]. This suggests that the broad excess might be related to the intermediate \u00b1 b and * b \u00b1 baryon states, although the current size of the data set does not allow this hypothesis to be tested. The observed m \u039b 0 b \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 distribution in the high-mass region is fit with a sum of three signal functions and a smooth background function obtained by multiplying the threshold function (x \u2212 x 0 ) \u03b2 by a first-order polynomial. The signal function describing the broad structure below 6100 MeV is a single Breit-Wigner function convolved with a double-Gaussian resolution function obtained from simulation. The narrow peak around 6150 MeV is modeled with the sum of two Breit-Wigner functions, each convolved with a double-Gaussian resolution function obtained from simulation, having an effective mass resolution of about 3.8 MeV.The natural widths of the two signals are fixed to those measured by the LHCb Collaboration[22]. The fit results for the yields and masses, respectively, are 301 \u00b1 72 and 6073 \u00b1 5 MeV for the broad enhancement, 70 \u00b1 35 and 6146.5 \u00b1 1.9 MeV for the \u039b 0 b (6146) 0 , and 113 \u00b1 35 and 6152.7 \u00b1 1.1 MeV for the \u039b 0 b (6152) 0 . The measured natural width of the broad excess is 55 \u00b111 (stat) MeV. While this work was under the journal review, a similar structure, consistent with the one reported here and possibly a new baryon state, has been observed by the LHCb Collaboration[39].",
