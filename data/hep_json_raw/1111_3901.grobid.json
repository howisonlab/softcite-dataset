No evidence for top production was found, consistent with the expectation from the Standard Model. Limits were computed for single-top production via flavour changing neutral current transitions involving a neutral electroweak vector boson, \u03b3 or Z . The result was combined with a previous ZEUS result yielding a total luminosity of 0.50 fb \u22121 .",

Flavour changing neutral current (FCNC) processes could enhance single-top production, but they are strongly suppressed in the SM by the GIM mechanism [3]. This mechanism forbids FCNCs at the tree level, allowing only for small contributions at the one-loop level, exploiting the flavour mixing due to the CKM matrix [4]. Several extensions of the SM predict FCNC contributions already at the tree level [5]. The search for such new interactions involving the top quark (ut or ct transitions mediated by neutral vector bosons, \u03b3 or Z ) opens an interesting window to look for effects beyond the SM [6].",

Owing to the large Z mass, this process is more sensitive to a coupling of the type tq\u03b3 . Furthermore, large values of x, the fraction of the proton momentum carried by the struck quark, are needed to produce a top quark.
