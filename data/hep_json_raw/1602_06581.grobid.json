The data sample, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.3 fb \u22121 , was collected with the CMS detector at the CERN LHC in 2015. The data are examined in search regions of jet multiplicity, tagged bottom quark jet multiplicity, missing transverse momentum, and the scalar sum of jet transverse momenta. The observed numbers of events in all search regions are found to be consistent with the expectations from standard model processes. Exclusion limits are presented for simplified supersymmetric models of gluino pair production. Depending on the assumed gluino decay mechanism, and for a massless, weakly interacting, lightest neutralino, lower limits on the gluino mass from 1440 to 1600 GeV are obtained, significantly extending previous limits.",

            "text": "The standard model (SM) of particle physics successfully describes a wide range of phenomena. However, in the SM, the Higgs boson mass is unstable to higher-order corrections, suggesting that the SM is incomplete. Many extensions to the SM have been proposed to provide a more fundamental theory. Supersymmetry (SUSY) [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8], one such extension, postulates that each SM particle is paired with a SUSY partner from which it differs in spin by one-half unit. As examples, squarks and gluinos are the SUSY partners of quarks and gluons, respectively, while neutralinos \u03c7 0 (charginos \u03c7 \u00b1 ) arise from a mixture of the SUSY partners of neutral (charged) Higgs and electroweak gauge bosons. Radiative corrections involving SUSY particles can compensate the contributions from SM particles and thereby stabilize the Higgs boson mass. For this cancellation to be \"natural\" [9][10][11][12], the top squark, bottom squark, and gluino must have masses on the order of a few TeV or less, possibly allowing them to be produced at the CERN LHC.",

Recent searches for gluino pair production at \u221a s = 8 TeV, based on data collected in LHC Run 1, are presented in Refs. [14][15][16]. Because of the large mass scales and their all-hadronic nature, the targeted SUSY events are expected to exhibit large values of H T , where H T is the scalar sum of the transverse momenta (p T ) of the jets. As a measure of missing transverse momentum, we use the variable H miss T , which is the magnitude of the vector sum of the jet p T . We present a general search for gluino pair production leading to final states with large H T , large H miss  number of jets and N b-jet the number of tagged bottom quark jets (b jets).

            "text": "We consider SUSY scenarios in the context of four simplified models [17][18][19][20] of new particle production. Diagrams for the four models are shown in Fig. 1. Simplified models contain the minimal particle content to represent a topological configuration. As SUSY production scenarios, the four simplified models can be interpreted as follows. In the first scenario, shown in Fig. 1 (upper left), gluino pair production is followed by the decay of each gluino to a bottom quark and an off-shell bottom squark. The off-shell bottom squark decays to a bottom quark and the LSP, where the LSP is assumed to be the lightest neutralino \u03c7 0 1 and to escape detection, leading to significant H miss T . The second scenario, shown in Fig. 1 (upper right), is the same as the first scenario except with top quarks and off-shell top squarks in place of the bottom quarks and squarks. The third scenario, shown in Fig. 1 (lower left), is the corresponding situation with gluino decay to a lightflavored quark and off-shell-squark: up, down, strange, and charm with equal probability, for each gluino separately. In the fourth scenario, shown in Fig. 1 (lower right), also based on gluino pair production, each gluino similarly decays to a light-flavored quark and corresponding off-shell squark. The off-shell squark decays to a quark and to either the next-to-lightest neutralino \u03c7 0 2 or the lightest chargino \u03c7 \u00b1 1 . The probability for the decay to proceed via the \u03c7 0 2 , \u03c7 + 1 , or \u03c7 \u2212 1 , integrated over the event sample, is 1/3 for each possibility. The \u03c7 0 2 ( \u03c7 \u00b1 1 ) subsequently decays to the \u03c7 0 1 LSP and to a on-or off-shell Z (W \u00b1 ) boson. We refer to the four simplified models as the T1bbbb, T1tttt, T1qqqq, and T5qqqqVV scenarios, respectively [21]. Thus the first two scenarios explicitly presume either bottom or top squark production. The latter two scenarios represent more inclusive situations and provide complementary sensitivity to top squark production for large values of N jet . We assume all SUSY particles other than the gluino, the LSP, and -for the T5qqqqVV models -the \u03c7 0 2 and \u03c7 \u00b1 1 , to be too heavy to be directly produced, and the gluino to be short-lived.",

The events with top quarks mostly arise from top quark-antiquark (tt) production, but also from single top quark processes. The W and Z bosons in W + jets and Z + jets events can be either on-or off-shell. For top quark and W + jets events, significant H miss T can arise if a W boson decays leptonically, producing a neutrino and an undetected charged lepton, while Z + jets events can exhibit significant H miss T if the Z boson decays to two neutrinos. For QCD multijet events, significant H miss T can arise if the event contains a charm or bottom quark that undergoes a semileptonic decay, but the principal source of H miss T is the mismeasurement of jet p T .

Within the solenoid volume are a silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL), and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter (HCAL). The ECAL and HCAL, each composed of a barrel and two endcap sections, extend over a pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 3.0. Forward calorimeters on each side of the interaction point encompass 3.0 < |\u03b7| < 5.0. The tracking detectors cover |\u03b7| < 2.5. Muons are measured within |\u03b7| < 2.4 by gas-ionization detectors embedded in the steel flux-return yoke outside the solenoid. The detector is nearly hermetic, permitting accurate measurements of H miss T . A more detailed description of the CMS detector, together with a definition of the coordinate system and relevant kinematic variables, is given in Ref. [24].",

The PF candidates are classified as photons, charged hadrons, neutral hadrons, electrons [27], or muons [28]. Additional quality criteria are imposed on electron and muon candidates. For example, more restrictive conditions are placed on the ECAL shower shape and on the ratio of energies deposited in the HCAL and ECAL for electron candidates, and on the matching of track segments between the silicon tracker and muon detector for muon candidates. The event primary vertex is taken to be the reconstructed vertex with the largest sum of charged-track p 2 T values and is required to lie within 24 cm (2 cm) of the center of the detector in the direction along (perpendicular to) the beam axis. Charged tracks from extraneous pp interactions within the same or a nearby bunch crossing (\"pileup\") are removed [29]. The PF objects serve as input for jet reconstruction, based on the anti-k T algorithm [30,31] with a distance parameter of 0.4. Jet quality criteria as described in Ref. [32] are applied to eliminate, for example, spurious events caused by calorimeter noise. Contributions to an individual jet's p T from pileup interactions are subtracted [33], and corrections are applied as a function of jet p T and \u03b7 to account for residual effects of nonuniform detector response [34].

Each CR event is entered into one of the 72 search regions with a weight that represents the probability for a lost-lepton event to appear with the corresponding values of H T , H miss T , N jet , and N b-jet . The CRs are selected by requiring events to satisfy the criteria of Section 3 except exactly one isolated electron or muon must be present and the isolated-track veto is not applied. The transverse mass formed from the p miss T and lepton p T vector is required to satisfy m T < 100 GeV: this requirement is effective at identifying SM events, which primarily arise from leptonic W boson decay, while reducing signal contamination. After applying this requirement, the fraction of CR events due to T1tttt (T5qqqqVV) signal contamination is generally negligible, viz., 0.1%, but it can be as high as around 30-40% (5-20%) for the largest values of N jet , N b-jet , H T , and/or H miss T , depending on m g and m \u03c7 0",

Since the efficiencies are parametrized in terms of kinematic and topological quantities, the method is insensitive to the specific mix of processes, i.e., it does not require the relative fractions of tt, single top, and W + jets events in the CRs to be the same as in the search regions (nonetheless, these fractions agree to within less than 1% in simulation). A correction derived from data is applied to the weights to account for the trigger efficiency, while corrections from simulation account for contamination due to nonprompt electrons, contamination due to dilepton events in which one of the leptons is lost, and the selection efficiency of the m T requirement. Corresponding efficiencies are evaluated for dileptonic events in which both leptons are lost. This latter source of background is predicted to account for <2% of the total lost-lepton background.

As a systematic uncertainty, we take the larger of the observed nonclosure in Fig. 3 (upper plot) or the statistical uncertainty in the nonclosure, for each search region, where \"nonclosure\" refers to the difference between the solid points and histogram. Additional systematic uncertainties are assigned based on a comparison between data and simulation of the lepton reconstruction, lepton isolation, and isolated track veto efficiencies. Within the statistical precision, there are no such differences observed, and the statistical uncertainty in the respective comparison is assigned as a systematic uncertainty. Uncertainties in the acceptance associated with the PDFs, including those related to the renormalization and factorization scales, are evaluated by varying the PDF sets used to produce the simulated samples. These uncertainties are defined by the maximum deviations observed from 100 variations of the NNPDF3.0LO PDFs for tt and W + jets events. The uncertainty in the jet energy correction is propagated to p miss T , and the resulting change in the m T selection efficiency is used to define a systematic uncertainty. Small systematic uncertainties related to the purity of the electron and muon CRs and to the statistical uncertainties in the simulated efficiencies are also evaluated.",

The principal standard model backgrounds, from events with top quarks, W bosons and jets, Z bosons and jets, and QCD multijet production, are evaluated using control samples in the data. The study is performed in the framework of a global likelihood fit in which the observed numbers of events in 72 exclusive bins in a four-dimensional array of H miss T , the number of jets, the number of tagged bottom quark jets, and H T , are compared to the standard model predictions. The standard model background estimates are found to agree with the observed numbers of events within the uncertainties.

The fraction of T1tttt (T5qqqqVV) events in the CR due to signal contamination is generally 0.1%, but can be as large as around 15-25% (4-8%) for the largest values of N jet , N b-jet , H T , and/or H miss T , depending on m g and m \u03c7 0 Following the smearing, the values of H T , H miss T , N jet , and N b-jet are calculated for the CR event, and the selection criteria of Section 3 are applied. The misidentification probability for a \u03c4 h jet to be erroneously identified as a b jet is taken into account. Corrections are applied to account for the trigger efficiency, the acceptance and efficiency of the \u03bc selection, and the ratio of branching fractions B F (W \u2192 \u03c4 h \u03bd)/B F (W \u2192 \u03bc\u03bd) = 0.65 [67]. The resulting event yield provides the \u03c4 h background estimate. The method is validated with a closure test, whose results are shown in the lower plot of Fig. 3. Systematic uncertainties are assigned based on the level of closure, as described for the lost-lepton background. Other systematic uncertainties are associated with the muon acceptance, the response functions, and the misidentification rate of \u03c4 h jets as b jets. The dominant uncertainty, as for the lost-lepton background, arises from the limited number of events in the CR.",
