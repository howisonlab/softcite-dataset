            "text": "Properties of the Higgs boson with mass near 125 GeV are measured in proton-proton collisions with the CMS experiment at the LHC. Comprehensive sets of production and decay measurements are combined. The decay channels include \u03b3 \u03b3 , ZZ, WW, \u03c4 \u03c4 , bb, and \u03bc\u03bc pairs. The data samples were collected in 2011 and 2012 and correspond to integrated luminosities of up to 5.1 fb \u22121 at 7 TeV and up to 19.7 fb \u22121 at 8 TeV. From the high-resolution \u03b3 \u03b3 and ZZ channels, the mass of the Higgs boson is determined to be 125.02 +0.26   \u22120.27 (stat) +0.14 \u22120.15 (syst) GeV. For this mass value, the event yields obtained in the different analyses tagging specific decay channels and production mechanisms are consistent with those expected for the standard model Higgs boson. The combined best-fit signal relative to the standard model expectation is 1.00 \u00b1 0.09 (stat) +0.08 \u22120.07 (theo) \u00b1 0.07 (syst) at the measured mass. The couplings of the Higgs boson are probed for deviations in magnitude from the standard model predictions in multiple ways, including searches for invisible and undetected decays. No significant deviations are found. \u2020 Events fulfilling the requirements of either selection are combined into one category \u2021 Values for analyses dedicated to the measurement of the mass that do not use the same categories and/or observables Composition in the regions for which the ratio of signal and background s/(s + b) > 0.05",

In the standard model (SM) [1][2][3] EWSB is achieved by a complex scalar doublet field that leads to the prediction of one physical Higgs boson (H) [4][5][6][7][8][9]. Through Yukawa interactions, the Higgs scalar field can also account for fermion masses [10][11][12].",

The H \u2192 WW \u2192 \u03bd \u03bd measurement has a high sensitivity due to large expected yields but relatively poor mass resolution because of the presence of neutrinos in the final state. The bb and \u03c4 \u03c4 decay modes are beset by large background contributions and have relatively poor mass resolution, resulting in lower sensitivity compared to the other channels; combining the results from bb and \u03c4 \u03c4 , the CMS Collaboration has published evidence for the decay of the Higgs boson to fermions [172]. In the SM the ggH process is dominated by a virtual top quark loop. However, the direct coupling of top quarks to the Higgs boson can be probed through the study of events tagged as having been produced via the ttH process.",

The two-lepton events are divided into eight categories, with different background compositions and signal-tobackground ratios. The events are split into SF and DF dilepton event categories, since the background from Drell-Yan production (qq \u2192 \u03b3 * /Z ( * ) \u2192 ) is much larger for SF dilepton events. For events with no jets, the main background is due to nonresonant WW production. For events with one jet, the dominant backgrounds are nonresonant WW production and top quark production. The 2-jet VBF tag is optimized to take advantage of the VBF production signature and the main background is due to top quark production. The 2-jet VH tag targets the decay of the vector boson into two jets, V \u2192 jj. The selection requires two centrally-produced jets with invariant mass in the range 65 < m jj < 105 GeV. To reduce the top quark, Drell-Yan, and WW backgrounds in all previous categories, a selection is performed on the dilepton mass and on the angular separation between the leptons. All background rates, except for very small contributions from WZ, ZZ, and W\u03b3 production, are evaluated from data. The two-dimensional distribution of events in the (m , m T ) plane is used for the measurements in the DF dilepton categories with zero and one jets; m is the invariant mass of the dilepton and m T is the transverse mass reconstructed from the dilepton transverse momentum and the E miss T vector. For the DF 2-jet VBF tag the binned distribution of m is used. For the SF dilepton categories and for the 2-jet VH tag channel, only the total event counts are used.",

The 0-jet category is used to constrain background normalizations, identification efficiencies, and energy scales.

This regression algorithm achieves a dijet mass resolution of about 10 % for m H = 125 GeV.

Events with higher p T (V) have smaller backgrounds and better dijet mass resolution.

For the 8 TeV data, the results are extracted from a twodimensional fit to the azimuthal angular difference between the leptons and the transverse mass of the system composed of the dilepton and the missing transverse energy in the event. Because of the smaller amount of data in the control samples used for modelling the backgrounds in the signal region, the results for the 7 TeV data set are based on a fit to the aforementioned transverse mass variable only. For the 0-jet categories the signal-to-background ratio varies between 0.24 and 0.28, while for the 1-jet categories it varies between 0.15 and 0.18, depending on the Z boson decay channel and the data set (7 or 8 TeV).

Events with two or more jets are assigned to 2-jet categories, while the remaining events are assigned to untagged categories.

The uncertainty due to the choice of the functional form used to model the background is incorporated in a different manner than in the H \u2192 \u03b3 \u03b3 analysis, namely by introducing an additive systematic uncertainty in the number of expected signal events. This uncertainty is estimated by evaluating the bias of the signal function plus nominal background function when fitted to pseudo-data generated from alternative background functions. The largest absolute value of this difference for all the alternative background functions considered and Higgs boson mass hypotheses between 120 and 150 GeV is taken as the systematic uncertainty and applied uniformly for all Higgs boson mass hypotheses.

The post-fit model, obtained using the best-fit set, is used when deriving expected quantities. The post-fit model corresponds to the parametric bootstrap described in the statistics literature and includes information gained in the fit regarding the values of all parameters [184,185]. The 68 and 95 % confidence level (CL) confidence intervals for a given parameter of interest, a i , are evaluated from q(a i ) = 1.00 and q(a i ) = 3.84, respectively, with all other unconstrained model parameters treated in the same way as the nuisance parameters. The two-dimensional (2D) 68 and 95 % CL confidence regions for pairs of parameters are derived from q(a i , a j ) = 2.30 and q(a i , a j ) = 5.99, respectively. This implies that boundaries of 2D confidence regions projected on either parameter axis are not identical to the one-dimensional (1D) confidence interval for that parameter. All results are given using the chosen test statistic, leading to approximate CL confidence intervals when there are no large non-Gaussian uncertainties [186][187][188], as is the case here. If the best-fit value is on a physical boundary, the theoretical basis for computing intervals in this manner is lacking. However, we have found that for the results in this paper, the intervals in those conditions are numerically similar to those obtained by the method of Ref. [189].",

While the variation of the total production cross section is dominated by the ggH production process, the variation is about 1.005 for VBF, around 1.016 for VH, and around 1.014 for ttH [171]. -The H \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 analysis of Ref. [23] focused on exploring the coupling of the Higgs boson to the tau lepton. For this reason nearly all results in Ref. [23] were obtained by treating the H \u2192 WW contribution as a background, set to the SM expectation. In the present combined analysis, both the H \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 and H \u2192 WW contributions are considered as signal in the \u03c4 \u03c4 decay tag analysis. This treatment leads to an increased sensitivity to the presence of a Higgs boson that decays into both \u03c4 \u03c4 and WW. -The search for invisible Higgs decays of Ref. [28] includes a modest contribution to the sensitivity from the analysis targeting ZH production with Z \u2192 bb decays. The events selected by that analysis overlap with those of the analysis of VH production with H \u2192 bb decays, and are therefore not considered in this combination. Given the limited sensitivity of that search, the overall sensitivity to invisible decays is not significantly impacted. -The contribution from the gg \u2192 ZH process was not included in Ref. [21] as calculations for the cross section as a function of p T (Z) were not available. Since then, the search for VH production with H \u2192 bb has been augmented by the use of recent NLO calculations for the gg \u2192 ZH contribution [176][177][178][179]. In the Z(\u03bd\u03bd)H(bb) and Z( )H(bb) channels, the addition of this process leads to an increase of the expected signal yields by 10 % to 30 % for p T (Z) around and above 150 GeV. When combined with the unchanged WH channels, the overall expected sensitivity for VH production with H \u2192 bb increases by about 10 %.",

The signal in all channels is assumed to be due to a single state with mass m H . The best-fit value of m H and its uncertainty are extracted from a scan of the combined test statistic q(m H ) with the three signal strength modifiers profiled together with all other nuisance parameters; i.e. the signal strength modifiers float freely in the fits performed to scan q(m H ). Figure 2 (left) shows the scan of the test statistic as a function of the mass m H separately for the H \u2192 \u03b3 \u03b3 and H \u2192 ZZ \u2192 4 channels, and for their combination. The intersections of the q(m H ) curves with the thick horizontal line at 1.00 and thin line at 3.84 define the 68 % and 95 % CL confidence intervals for the mass of the observed particle, respectively. These intervals include both the statistical and systematic uncertainties. The mass is measured to be m H = 125.02 +0.29 \u22120.31 GeV. The less precise evaluations from the H \u2192 WW analysis [22], m H = 128 +7 \u22125 GeV, and from the H \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 analysis [23], m H = 122 \u00b1 7 GeV, are compatible with this result. To evaluate the statistical component of the overall uncertainty, we also perform a scan of q(m H ) fixing all nuisance parameters to their best-fit values, except those related to the H \u2192 \u03b3 \u03b3 background models; given that the H \u2192 \u03b3 \u03b3 background distributions are modelled from fits to data, their degrees of freedom encode fluctuations which are statistical in nature.

Using the detailed information on the expected SM Higgs production contributions, Sect. 6.3 discusses, for each decay tag group, the results of considering two signal strengths, one scaling the ggH and ttH contributions, and the other scaling the VBF and VH contributions. Then, assuming the expected relative SM Higgs branching fractions, Sect. 6.4 provides a combined analysis for signal strengths scaling the ggH, VBF, VH, and ttH contributions individually. Turning to the decay modes, Sect. 6.5 performs combined analyses of signal strength ratios between different decay modes, where some uncertainties from theory and some experimental uncertainties cancel out. Finally, using the structure of the matrix of production and decay mode signal strengths, Sect. 6.6 tests for the possibility that the observations are due to the presence of more than one state degenerate in mass.",

            "text": "The four main Higgs boson production mechanisms can be associated with either couplings of the Higgs boson to fermions (ggH and ttH) or vector bosons (VBF and VH). Therefore, a combination of channels associated with a particular decay mode tag, but explicitly targeting different production mechanisms, can be used to test the relative strengths of the couplings to the vector bosons and fermions, mainly the top quark, given its importance in ggH production. The categorization of the different channels into production mode tags is not pure. Contributions from the different signal processes, evaluated from Monte Carlo simulation and shown in Table 1, are taken into account in the fits, including theory and experimental uncertainties; the factors used to scale the expected contributions from the different production modes are shown in Table 3 and do not depend on the decay mode. For a given decay mode, identical deviations of \u03bc VBF,VH and \u03bc ggH,ttH from unity may also be due to a departure of the decay partial width from the SM expectation. Figure 5 (left) shows the 68 % CL confidence regions for the signal strength modifiers associated with the ggH and ttH and with the VBF and VH production mechanisms, \u03bc ggH,ttH and \u03bc VBF,VH , respectively. The five sets of contours correspond to the five predominant decay mode groups, introduced in Sect. 3.3. It can be seen in Fig. 5 (left) how the analyses in the H \u2192 bb decay group constrain \u03bc VBF,VH more than \u03bc ggH,ttH , reflecting the larger sensitivity of the analysis of VH production with H \u2192 bb with respect to the analysis of ttH production with H \u2192 bb. An almost complementary situation can be found for the H \u2192 ZZ analysis, where the data constrain \u03bc ggH,ttH better than \u03bc VBF,VH , reflecting the fact that the analysis is more sensitive to ggH, the most abundant production mode. The SM Higgs boson expectation of (1, 1) is within the 68 % CL confidence regions for all predominant decay groups. The best-fit values for each decay tag group are given in Table 5.",

These scaling factors are applied to the expected signal contributions from the SM Higgs boson according to their production mode, as shown in Table 6. It is assumed that the relative values of the branching fractions are those expected for the SM Higgs boson. This assumption is relaxed, in different ways, in Sects. 6.5 and 6.6. Figure 6 summarizes the results of likelihood scans for the four parameters of interest described in Table 6 in terms of the 68 % CL (inner) and 95 % CL (outer) confidence intervals. When scanning the likelihood of the data as a function of one parameter, the other parameters are profiled. Table 7 shows the best-fit results for the 7 TeV and 8 TeV data sets separately, as well as for the full combined analysis. Based on the combined likelihood ratio values for each parameter,   Likelihood scan versus the ratio \u03bc VBF,VH /\u03bc ggH,ttH , combined for all channels. The fit for \u03bc VBF,VH /\u03bc ggH,ttH is performed while profiling the five \u03bc ggH,ttH parameters, one per visible decay mode, as shown in Table 4. The solid curve represents the observed result in data while the dashed curve indicates the expected median result in the presence of the SM Higgs boson. Crossings with the horizontal thick and thin lines denote the 68 % CL and 95 % CL confidence intervals, respectively Table 4 Parameterization used to scale the expected SM Higgs boson yields for the different production processes and decay modes when obtaining the \u03bc VBF,VH /\u03bc ggH,ttH results presented in Table 5 and  expected significance, and the pull of the results with respect to the SM hypothesis. The observed significance is derived from the observed likelihood ratio for the background-only hypothesis, \u03bc i = 0, in data. The expected significance is derived from the likelihood ratio for \u03bc i = 0 obtained using the median expected result for the SM Higgs boson. The pull with respect to the SM hypothesis is derived from the observed likelihood ratio for \u03bc i = 1; by definition, the expected pull with respect to the SM hypothesis is zero. The \u03bc ggH best-fit value is found to be 0.85 +0.19 \u22120.16 . After calculating the component of the uncertainty that is statistical in Table 5 The best-fit values for the signal strength of the VBF and VH and of the ggH and ttH production mechanisms, \u03bc VBF,VH and \u03bc ggH,ttH , respectively, for m H = 125.0 GeV. The channels are grouped by decay mode tag as described in Sect. 3.3. The observed and median expected results for the ratio of \u03bc VBF,VH to \u03bc ggH,ttH together with their uncertainties are also given for the full combination. In the full combination, \u03bc VBF,VH /\u03bc ggH,ttH is determined while profiling the five \u03bc ggH,ttH parameters, one per decay mode, as shown in Table 4 Channel nature (stat) and the component related to the theory inputs (theo), one can subtract them in quadrature from the total uncertainty and assign the remainder as the systematic uncertainty (syst), yielding 0.85 +0.11 \u22120.09 (stat) +0.11 \u22120.08 (theo) +0.10 \u22120.09 (syst). Advances in the calculation of the ggH cross section, e.g. when considering higher-order effects, may not only reduce formed as a function of \u03bc VBF (or \u03bc VH ), allowing the modifiers associated with the other production processes to float in the fit together with the nuisance parameters. In data, the bestfit result for \u03bc VBF is 1.16 +0.37 \u22120.34 , while for \u03bc VH it is 0.92 +0.38 \u22120.36 . For the ttH production mode, the best-fit value for \u03bc ttH is found to be 2.90 +1.08 \u22120.94 . The results for VBF, VH, and ttH are driven by the corresponding tagged categories, while the contribution from ggH is constrained by the 0-jet and untagged categories.",

Therefore, these measurements only assume the SM ratio of ggH and ttH cross sections and the ratio of VBF and VH cross sections.

While correlated uncertainties from theory and correlated experimental uncertainties may cancel out to some extent in these ratios, each ratio includes the statistical uncertainties from the two decay modes involved.

Alternatively, a superposition of states with indistinguishable mass values is expected in models or theories beyond the SM [194][195][196][197]. In this section we explore the validity of this assumption. Taking advantage of the very good mass resolution in the H \u2192 \u03b3 \u03b3 analysis, the presence of near mass-degenerate states has been previously probed down to mass differences between 2.5 GeV and 4 GeV without evidence for the presence of a second state [18]. Given the finite mass resolution, such searches are not sensitive to a mixture of states with mass values closer than the resolution itself, such that other reported measurements would integrate the contributions from both states.",

However, the distinction between states can still be made, provided that the states have different coupling structures, i.e. different coupling strengths to the SM particles. Using the measurements of the different production and decay tags, as well as the detailed knowledge of their expected composition in terms of production processes and decay modes, it is possible to test the compatibility of the observations with the expectations from a single state. Several authors discussed this possibility, proposing methods to look for deviations assuming that, in the presence of more than one state, the individual states would couple differently to the SM particles [198,199].",

The scaling factors among different types of fermions, leptons versus quarks and up-type versus down-type, are investigated in Sect. 7.3. In Sect. 7.4, we consider the results of a fit for the tree-level coupling scaling factors and the relation between the observations and the corresponding particle masses.

When one of the parameters in a group is evaluated, others are treated as nuisance parameters    f . The partial width \u0393 \u03b3 \u03b3 is induced via loop diagrams, with the W boson and top quark being the dominant contributors, and is scaled with \u03ba 2 \u03b3 (\u03ba b , \u03ba \u03c4 , \u03ba t , \u03ba W ), a function defined in Eq. (113) of Ref. [171]. In the likelihood scan as a function of \u03bb WZ , both \u03ba Z and \u03ba f are profiled together with all other nuisance parameters. The introduction of \u03ba f carries with it the assumption that the coupling to all fermions is common, but possibly different from the SM expectation. The likelihood scan is shown in Fig. 8 (right) with a solid curve. The dashed curve indicates the median expected result for the SM Higgs boson, given the current data set. The measured value from the combined analysis of all channels is \u03bb WZ = 0.92 +0.14 \u22120.12 and is consistent with the expectation from the SM. Given these results, and unless otherwise noted, in all subsequent measurements we assume \u03bb WZ = 1 and use a common factor \u03ba V to modify the couplings to W and Z bosons, while preserving their ratio. In the SM, the nature of the coupling of the Higgs boson to fermions, through a Yukawa interaction, is different from the nature of the Higgs boson coupling to the massive vector bosons, a result of electroweak symmetry breaking. Some BSM models predict couplings to fermions and massive vector bosons different from those in the SM. We compare the observations in data with the expectation for the SM Higgs boson by fitting two parameters, \u03ba V and \u03ba f , where \u03ba V = \u03ba W = \u03ba Z is a common scaling factor for massive vector bosons, and \u03ba f = \u03ba b = \u03ba t = \u03ba \u03c4 is a common scaling factor for fermions. We assume that \u0393 BSM = 0. At leading order, all partial widths scale either as \u03ba 2 V or \u03ba 2 f , except for \u0393 \u03b3 \u03b3 . As discussed in Sect. 7.1, the partial width \u0393 \u03b3 \u03b3 is induced via loops with virtual W bosons or top quarks and scales as a function of both \u03ba V and \u03ba f . For that reason, the H \u2192 \u03b3 \u03b3 channel is the only channel being combined that is sensitive to the relative sign of \u03ba V and \u03ba f . Figure 9 shows the 2D likelihood scan over the (\u03ba V , \u03ba f ) parameter space. While Fig. 9 (left) allows for different signs of \u03ba V and \u03ba f , Fig. 9 (right) constrains the scan to the (+, +) quadrant that contains the SM expectation (1, 1). The (\u2212, \u2212) and (\u2212, +) quadrants are not shown since they are degenerate with respect to the ones studied, with the implication that with the available analyses we can only probe whether \u03ba V and \u03ba f have the same sign or different signs. Studies of the production of a Higgs boson associated with a single top quark can, in principle, lift that degeneracy.",

The data are compatible with the expectation for the standard model Higgs boson: the point (\u03ba V , \u03ba f ) = (1, 1) is within the 68 % CL confidence region defined by the data. Because of the way these compatibility tests are constructed, any significant deviations from (1, 1) would not have a straightforward interpretation within the SM and would imply BSM physics; the scale and sign of the best-fit values in the case of significant deviations would guide us in identifying the most plausible BSM scenarios. Figure 10 shows the results of this combined analysis in the different decay mode groups. The role and interplay of different channels is important. For example, Fig. 9 (left) shows a region in the (+, \u2212) quadrant, where \u03ba V and \u03ba f have opposite signs, which is excluded at the 95 % CL but not at the 99.7 % CL; it can be seen in Fig. 10 (left) how the combined exclusion in the (+, \u2212) quadrant is foremost due to the ability of the H \u2192 \u03b3 \u03b3 decay to discern the relative sign between \u03ba V and \u03ba f . This is due to the destructive interference between the amplitudes of the W loops and top quark loops in the H \u2192 \u03b3 \u03b3 decay:",

For example, in the minimal supersymmetric standard model [204], the couplings of neutral Higgs bosons to up-type and down-type fermions are modified, with the modification being the same for all three generations and for quarks and leptons. In more general 2HDMs, leptons can be made to virtually decouple from one Higgs boson that otherwise behaves in a SM-like way with respect to the W bosons, Z bosons, and quarks. Inspired by the possibility of such modifications to the fermion couplings, we perform two combinations in which we allow for different ratios of the couplings to down-type fermions and up-type fermions (\u03bb du = \u03ba d /\u03ba u ) or different ratios of the couplings to leptons and quarks (\u03bb q = \u03ba /\u03ba q ).

This is in contrast with the coupling to weak bosons, g V , which involves the square of the mass of the weak boson, m V . With these differences in mind, it is possible to motivate a phenomenological parameterization relating the masses of the fermions and weak bosons to the corresponding \u03ba modifiers using two parameters, M and [205,206].   In such a model one has for each fermion \u03ba f = v m f /M 1+ and for each weak boson  if the couplings were independent of the masses of the particles, one would expect to find = \u22121. To perform a fit to data, the particle mass values need to be specified. For leptons and weak bosons we have taken the values from Ref. [207]. For consistency with theoretical calculations used in setting the SM expectations, the top quark mass is taken to be 172. The results of the two fits above are plotted versus the particle masses in Fig. 13.

While the existing measurement of the scaling factor for the coupling of the boson with muons is clearly imprecise, the picture that arises from covering more than three orders of magnitude in particle mass is that the boson couples differently to the different particles and that those couplings are related to the mass of each particle. This is further supported by upper limits set in searches for H \u2192 ee decays: when assuming the production cross sections predicted in the SM, the branching fraction is limited to be B(H \u2192 ee) < 1.9 \u00d7 10 \u22123 at the 95 % CL [30].",

To explore this possibility, we consider a further parameter that allows for a partial decay width into BSM particles, BR BSM = \u0393 BSM /\u0393 tot . In this case, the total width scales as \u03ba 2 H \u223c (0.0857 \u03ba 2 g + 0.0023 \u03ba 2 \u03b3 + 0.912)/(1 \u2212 BR BSM ).

While under the SM hypothesis the expected 95 % CL confidence interval for BR BSM is [0.00, 0.42], the data are such that the 95 % CL confidence interval for BR BSM is [0.00, 0.32], narrower than the expectation. The best fit in data also takes into account variations in \u03ba g and \u03ba \u03b3 , particularly the preference for \u03ba g smaller than unity in data, which influences the observed limit on BR BSM .  A further step can be taken by also including the data from the searches for H(inv). The H(inv) searches reported an observed (expected) upper limit on BR inv of 0.58 (0.44) at the 95 % CL [28]. When including the H(inv) search results in the combined analysis, one can only obtain bounds assuming that there are no undetected decay modes, BR undet = 0, i.e. that BR BSM = BR inv . The results for the likelihood scan as a function of BR inv (BR undet = 0) when including the data from the H(inv) searches is shown in Fig. 15 (middle). The expected 95 % CL confidence interval for BR inv (BR undet = 0) under the SM hypothesis is [0.00, 0.29], 31 % narrower than in the above case studied without the H(inv) data, a reflection of the added power of the H(inv) analysis. On the other hand, the 95 % CL confidence interval for BR inv (BR undet = 0) in data is [0.00, 0.32], similar to the result obtained without including the H(inv) data, because the observed upper limit on BR inv was found to be larger than expected in those searches. It should be noted that the shape of the observed curve changes substantially and the inclusion of the H(inv) data leads to a very shallow minimum of the likelihood when BR inv (BR undet = 0) = 0.03.",
