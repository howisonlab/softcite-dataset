The observed branching fraction for B \u2212 \u2192 p\u039bD 0 is (1.43 +0.28   \u22120.25 \u00b1 0.18) \u00d7 10 \u22125 with a significance of 8.1 standard deviations, where the uncertainties are statistical and systematic, respectively. Most of the signal events have the p\u039b mass peaking near threshold. No significant signal is observed for B \u2212 \u2192 p\u039bD * 0 and the corresponding upper limit on the branching fraction is 4.8 \u00d7 10 \u22125 at the 90% confidence level.",

[20]. The Fisher discriminant is a linear combination of several variables with coefficients that are optimized to separate signal and background. In addition to the Fisher discriminant, two variables cos \u03b8 B and \u2206z are used to form signal and background probability density functions (PDFs). The variable \u03b8 B is the angle between the reconstructed B direc-tion and the beam axis in the CM frame, and \u2206z is the difference between the z positions of the candidate B vertex and the vertex of the rest of the final state particles, presumably, from the other B in the \u03d2(4S) decay. The products of the above PDFs, obtained from signal and continuum MC simulations, give the event-by-event signal and background likelihoods, L S and L B . We apply a selection on the likelihood ratio, R = L S /(L S + L B ) to suppress background. Information associated with the accompanying B meson can also be used to distinguish B events from continuum events. The variables used are \"q\" and \"r\" from a B flavor-tagging algorithm [21]. The value of the preferred flavor q equals +1 for B 0 /B + and \u22121 for ",

The overall modeling uncertainty for B \u2212 \u2192 p\u039bD * 0 of 28.6% is obtained from two kinds of PDF modifications. The parameters of the fixed CF component are varied by their \u00b11\u03c3 statistical uncertainties, which were obtained from the fit to the \u2206M sideband region. We also include an additional PDF for the combinatorial background based on the PYTHIA [22] b quark fragmentation process, e.g.,",

No significant signal is found for B \u2212 \u2192 p\u039bD * 0 and the corresponding upper limit is 4.8 \u00d7 10 \u22125 at the 90% confidence level. We also observe a p\u039b enhancement near threshold for B \u2212 \u2192 p\u039bD 0 , which is similar to a common feature found in charmless three-body baryonic B decays [3]. The measured B \u2212 \u2192 p\u039bD 0 branching fraction agrees with the theoretical prediction of (1.14 \u00b1 0.26) \u00d7 10 \u22125 [5]. This indicates that the generalized factorization approach with parameters determined from experimental data gives reasonable estimates for b \u2192 c decays. This information can be helpful for future theoretical studies of the angular distribution puzzle in the penguin-dominated processes, B \u2212 \u2192 ppK \u2212 and B 0 \u2192 p\u039b\u03c0 \u2212 [5]. The measured branching fraction for B \u2212 \u2192 p\u039bD 0 can also be used to tune the parameters in the event generator, e.g., PYTHIA, for fragmentation processes involving b quarks. Although the current statistics for B \u2212 \u2192 p\u039bD 0 are still too low to perform an angular analysis of the baryon-antibaryon system, the proposed super flavor factories [26,27] offer promising venues for such studies.",
