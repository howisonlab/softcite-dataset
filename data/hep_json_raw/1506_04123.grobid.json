We measure the CPT-violating asymmetry in the decay B 0 s \u2192 \u00b5 \u00b1 D \u00b1 s as a function of celestial direction and sidereal phase. We find no evidence for CPT-violating effects and place limits on the direction and magnitude of flavor-dependent CPTand Lorentz-invariance violating coupling coefficients. We find 95% confidence intervals of \u2206a \u22a5 < 1.2 \u00d7 10 \u221212 GeV and (\u22120.8 < \u2206aT \u2212 0.396\u2206aZ < 3.9) \u00d7 10 \u221213 GeV.",

The Standard Model Extension (SME) [1] provides a framework for potential Lorentz and CPT invariance violation (CPTV), suggesting that such violations can occur at the Planck scale but still result in potentially observable effects at currently available collider energies. The process of neutral meson oscillations is described by a 2\u00d72 effective Hamiltonian with mass eigenvalues of the propagating particles having very small differences between them that drive the oscillation probability. For the B 0 s -B 0 s system, the fractional difference between the eigenvalues is of the order of 10 \u221212 . Due to this, B 0 s -B 0 s oscillations form an interferometric system that is very sensitive to small couplings between the valence quarks and a possible Lorentz-invariance violating field, making it an ideal place to search for new physics [2].",

We assume no CP violation in mixing [12], so only about half of the observed B 0 s have the same flavor as they had at birth. We assume no CP violation, so those observed B 0 s mesons which have changed their flavor do not contribute to CPTV, leading to a 50% dilution in the measured asymmetry.

The D \u2212 s \u2192 \u03c6\u03c0 \u2212 , \u03c6 \u2192 K + K \u2212 decay is reconstructed by assuming the two \u03c6 decay particles are kaons, requiring p T > 0.7 GeV, opposite charges, and M (K + K \u2212 ) < 1.07 GeV. The charge of the third particle, assumed to be the charged pion, must have charge opposite to that of the muon and 0.5 < p T < 25 GeV. The three tracks are combined to create a common D \u2212 s decay vertex using the algorithm described in Ref. [15].

Systematic uncertainties of the fitting method on the extracted values of A in sidereal bin i, A(i), are evaluated by varying the fitting procedure and are assigned to be half of the maximal variation in the asymmetry. The mass range of the fit is shifted from 1.700 < M (K + K \u2212 \u03c0 \u00b1 ) < 2.300 GeV to 1.724 < M (K + K \u2212 \u03c0 \u00b1 ) < 2.270 GeV in steps of 6 MeV resulting in an absolute uncertainty on the measured asymmetries of 0.035%. The width of the mass bins is changed between 1 and 12 MeV resulting in an absolute uncertainty of 0.071%. The functions modelling the signal are modified to fit the D \u00b1 and D \u00b1 s mass peaks by single Gaussian functions, the background is fitted by varying between a fourth-and seventh-order polynomial function, and the parameter p 1 in the threshold function is allowed to vary. As a test, the fraction of data in each sidereal bin, f i is fixed to exactly 1/11. These variations of the signal modelling yield an absolute uncertainty on the asymmetry of 0.085%. The uncertainty for each of these sources is added in quadrature, to give the total systematic uncertainty of the fitting procedure of 0.12%. This uncertainty on the measured values of A(i) is found to be independent of sidereal bin, and is added in quadrature to the statistical uncertainty to extract the CPT-violating parameters by fitting to Eq. 6 (see Table I).

The lower mass peak is due to the decay D \u2213 \u2192 \u03c6\u03c0 \u2213 and the second peak is due to the D \u2213 s meson decay.
