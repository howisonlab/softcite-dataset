The analysis uses data corresponding to integrated luminosities of 1.0 and 2.0 fb \u22121 collected with the LHCb detector at center-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 TeV, respectively. The W bosons are reconstructed using the W \u2192 \u03bc\u03bd decay and muons with a transverse momentum, p T , larger than 20 GeV in the pseudorapidity range 2.0 < \u03b7 < 4.5. The partons are reconstructed as jets with p T > 20 GeV and 2.2 < \u03b7 < 4.2. The sum of the muon and jet momenta must satisfy p T > 20 GeV. The fraction of W \u00fe jet events that originate from beauty and charm quarks is measured, along with the charge asymmetries of the W \u00fe b and W \u00fe c production cross sections. The ratio of the W \u00fe jet to Z \u00fe jet production cross sections is also measured using the Z \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc decay. All results are in agreement with Standard Model predictions.",

            "text": "The jet produced in association with the W boson may originate from a b quark (W \u00fe b), c quark (W \u00fe c) or light parton. Several processes contribute to the W \u00fe b and W \u00fe c final states at next-to-leading order (NLO) in perturbative QCD. The dominant mechanism for W \u00fe c production is gs \u2192 Wc, but there are also important contributions from gs \u2192 Wcg, gg \u2192 Wcs, and qq \u2192 Wcc [1]. Therefore, measuring the ratio of the W \u00fe c to W \u00fe jet production cross sections in the forward region at the LHC provides important constraints on the s quark PDF [2,3] at momentum transfers of Q \u2248 100 GeV (c \u00bc 1 throughout this article) and momentum fractions down to x \u2248 10 \u22125 . Previous measurements of the proton s quark PDF were primarily based on deep inelastic scattering experiments with Q \u2248 1 GeV and x values O\u00f00.1\u00de [4][5][6]. The W \u00fe c cross section has been measured at the Tevatron [7,8] and at the LHC [9,10] in the central region.",

Additionally, measurements of the Z \u00fe jet and Z \u00fe b cross sections have been made [20,21]. In this article, the associated production of a W boson with a jet originating from either a light parton or a heavy-flavor quark is studied using pp collisions at center-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 TeV. The production of the W \u00fe b final state via top quark decay is not included in the signal definition in this analysis, but is reported separately in Ref. [22]. A comprehensive approach is taken, where the inclusive W \u00fe jet, W \u00fe b and W \u00fe c contributions are measured simultaneously, rather than split across multiple measurements as in Refs. [9,10,15,[23][24][25][26]. The identification of c jets, in conjunction with b jets, is performed using the tagging algorithm described in Ref. [27], which improves upon previous c-tagging methods where muons or exclusive decays were required to identify the jet [9,10]. For each center-of-mass energy, the following production cross section ratios are measured: \u03c3\u00f0Wb\u00de=\u03c3\u00f0Wj\u00de, \u03c3\u00f0Wc\u00de=\u03c3\u00f0Wj\u00de, \u03c3\u00f0W \u00fe j\u00de=\u03c3\u00f0Zj\u00de, \u03c3\u00f0W \u2212 j\u00de=\u03c3\u00f0Zj\u00de, A\u00f0Wb\u00de, and A\u00f0Wc\u00de, where",

The detector includes a high-precision tracking system consisting of a silicon-strip vertex detector surrounding the pp interaction region [31], a large-area silicon-strip detector located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4 Tm, and three stations of silicon-strip detectors and straw drift tubes [32] placed downstream of the magnet. The tracking system provides a measurement of momentum, p, of charged particles with a relative uncertainty that varies from 0.5% at low momentum to 1.0% at 200 GeV. The minimum distance of a track to a primary vertex, the impact parameter, is measured with a resolution of \u00f015 \u00fe 29=p T \u00de \u03bcm, with p T in GeV. Different types of charged hadrons are distinguished using information from two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors. Photons, electrons and hadrons are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter and a hadronic calorimeter. The electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters have energy resolutions of \u03c3\u00f0E\u00de=E \u00bc 10%=",

The high-p T muon candidate is not removed from the anti-k T inputs and so is clustered into a jet. This jet, referred to as the muon jet and denoted as j \u03bc , is used to discriminate between W \u00fe jet and dijet events. The requirement p T \u00f0j \u03bc \u00fe j\u00de > 20 GeV is made to suppress dijet backgrounds, which are well balanced in p T , unlike W \u00fe jet events where there is undetected energy from the neutrino. Furthermore, the distribution of the fractional muon candidate p T within the muon jet, p T \u00f0\u03bc\u00de=p T \u00f0j \u03bc \u00de, is used to separate vector bosons from jets. For vector-boson production, this ratio deviates from unity only due to muon FSR, activity from the underlying event, or from neutralparticle production in a separate pp collision, whereas for jet production this ratio is driven to smaller values by the presence of additional radiation produced in association with the muon candidate.",

This is due to the large semileptonic branching fraction of b hadrons. In the W \u00fe jet signal region there are significant contributions from both b and c jets. As a consistency check, the b, c, and light-parton yields are obtained in the p T \u00f0\u03bc\u00de=p T \u00f0j \u03bc \u00de > 0.9 signal region from a fit using only two of the BDT inputs, both of which rely only on basic SV properties, the track multiplicity and the corrected mass, which is defined as where M andp are the invariant mass and momentum of the particles that form the SV, and \u03b8 is the angle betweenp and the flight direction. The corrected mass, which is the minimum mass for a long-lived hadron whose trajectory is consistent with the flight direction, peaks near the D meson mass for c jets and consequently provides excellent discrimination against other jet types. The SV track multiplicity identifies b jets well, since b-hadron decays typically produce many displaced tracks. In Fig. 4, the distributions of M cor and SV track multiplicity for a subsample of SV-tagged events with BDT\u00f0bcjudsg\u00de > 0.2 (see Fig. 2) are fitted simultaneously. The templates used in these fits are obtained from data in the same manner as the SV-tagger BDT templates. After correcting for the efficiency of requiring BDT\u00f0bcjudsg\u00de > 0.2, the b and c yields determined from the fits to M cor and SV track multiplicity and from the two-dimensional BDT fits are consistent. The mistag probability for W \u00fe light-parton events in this sample is found to be approximately 0.3%, which agrees with the value obtained from simulation.  The Z \u00fe b and Z \u00fe c yields are obtained by fitting the SVtagger BDT distributions in the fully reconstructed Z \u00fe jet data samples and then correcting for the missedmuon probability.

The uncertainty on the charge asymmetries due to determination of the W boson yields is evaluated using an alternative method for obtaining the charge asymmetries. The raw charge asymmetry in the b-jet and c-jet yields in the p T \u00f0\u03bc\u00de=p T \u00f0j \u03bc \u00de > 0.9 region is obtained from the SV-tagger BDT fits. The Z \u00fe jet and dijet backgrounds are charge symmetric at the percent level and contribute at most to 20% of the events in this p T \u00f0\u03bc\u00de=p T \u00f0j \u03bc \u00de region. Therefore, A\u00f0Wb\u00de and A\u00f0Wc\u00de are approximated by scaling the raw asymmetries by the inverse of the W boson purity in the p T \u00f0\u03bc\u00de=p T \u00f0j \u03bc \u00de > 0.9 region. A small correction must also be applied to A\u00f0Wb\u00de to account for top quark production. The difference between the asymmetries from this method and the nominal method is assigned as a systematic uncertainty from W boson signal determination. The uncertainty on A\u00f0Wb\u00de due to top quark production is taken from Ref. [22].",

Each result is compared to SM predictions calculated at NLO using MCFM [43] and the CT10 PDF set [44] as described in Sec. II. Production of W \u00fe jet events in the forward region requires a large imbalance in x of the initial partons. In the four-flavor scheme at leading order, W \u00fe b production proceeds via qq \u2192 Wg\u00f0bb\u00de, where the charge of the W boson has the same sign as that of the initial parton with larger x. Therefore, A\u00f0Wb\u00de \u2248 \u00fe1=3 is predicted due to the valence quark content of the proton. The dominant mechanism for W \u00fe c production is gs \u2192 Wc, which is charge symmetric assuming symmetric s ands quark PDFs. However, the Cabibbo-suppressed contribution from gd \u2192 Wc leads to a prediction of a small negative value for A\u00f0Wc\u00de.",
