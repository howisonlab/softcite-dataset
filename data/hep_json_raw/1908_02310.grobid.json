The detection of neutrinos from these many sources has led to profound insights across the fields of particle physics, nuclear physics, and astrophysics.",

Colliders copiously produce both neutrinos and anti-neutrinos of all flavors and, as we will discuss, most are produced at very high energies where neutrino interactions are not well studied. Collider neutrinos are therefore highly complementary to those from other sources, and there has been a longstanding interest in detecting them; see, e.g., Refs. [12][13][14][15][16]. Nevertheless, collider neutrinos have not yet been detected for at least two reasons. First and most obviously, neutrinos interact very weakly. The probability for a neutrino to interact in a meter of water is roughly P \u223c 4 \u00d7 10 \u221213 (E \u03bd /GeV) for the GeV to TeV energies of interest. Given the fluxes and energies of neutrinos produced at colliders and the typical sizes and coverage of collider detectors, neutrino interactions are very rare and difficult to detect above background. Second, the highest energy collider neutrinos, and therefore the ones with the largest interaction cross sections, are produced along the beamline. Collider detectors have holes along the beamline to let the beams in, and so are blind in this region and miss the enormous flux of high-energy neutrinos streaming down the beam pipe.",

Collider neutrinos are predominantly produced in hadron decays, and hadrons are predominantly produced along the beamline. Such neutrinos will easily pass through the 100 m of concrete and rock between the ATLAS IP and FASER, while almost all other standard model (SM) particles will be either deflected or absorbed before reaching FASER. Preliminary measurements were made by small, pilot emulsion detectors that were installed and removed in Technical Stops in 2018. These detectors were placed in TI12 and TI18, a symmetric location on the other side of ATLAS that was considered for FASER. As discussed below in Sects. 5 and 6, these detectors have provided useful and encouraging data concerning background and signal rates in these locations [34]. FASER's neutrino detection capability was briefly discussed in the experiment's Letter of Intent [35] and Technical Proposal [36]. More detailed studies on the detector design and physics sensitivities are reported here for the first time. A recent study of Beni et al. [37] has analyzed various locations around the LHC for neutrino detection and has found that, incorporating the background results from FASER, TI12 and TI18 are the best locations among those they considered.",

For an integrated luminosity of 150 fb \u22121 collected during Run 3 of the 14 TeV LHC from 2021-23, 2 \u00d7 10 11 electron neutrinos, 6 \u00d7 10 12 muon neutrinos, and 4 \u00d7 10 9 tau neutrinos, along with a comparable number of anti-neutrinos of each flavor, will stream through FASER\u03bd. Assuming SM cross sections, this implies that 850 \u03bd e , 450\u03bd e , 14,000 \u03bd \u03bc , 6000\u03bd \u03bc , 14 \u03bd \u03c4 , and 7\u03bd \u03c4 will interact in FASER\u03bd. Notably, the mean energy of neutrinos that interact in FASER\u03bd is between 600 GeV and 1 TeV, depending on the flavor. These energies are above the energies of previously detected man-made neutrinos, but also below the energies of the neutrinos detected by IceCube. FASER\u03bd will therefore not only detect the first collider neutrinos, but will also probe neutrino interactions in an energy range where neutrino cross sections are unconstrained, with a host of interesting implications. As examples, FASER\u03bd will be able to bound \u03bd \u03bc interactions in the TeV energy range, add significantly to the handful of \u03bd \u03c4 events that have been directly detected so far, and detect the highest energy manmade electron and tau neutrinos, and may also be able to constrain the charm content of the nucleon and probe nonstandard neutrino interactions, possibly opening up a new window on physics beyond the standard model (BSM).",

            "text": "Neutrino scattering provides a window on the interactions of leptons with matter, particularly in the deep inelastic scattering (DIS) regime with neutrino energies E \u03bd 10 GeV, where one can access fundamental neutrino-parton interactions. The main sources of high-energy neutrino measurements have been the neutrino beams from the CERN SPS (400 GeV proton) and Fermilab Tevatron (800 GeV proton) accelerators. The maximum attainable neutrino energy from these accelerator sources is 360 GeV, and there is not much data available at such high energies. The existing neutrinonucleon charged current (CC) scattering cross section measurements for \u03bd e , \u03bd \u03bc , and \u03bd \u03c4 are shown in Fig. 3. We now discuss each flavor in turn: \u03bd e : There are several measurements of electron neutrino cross sections, however, most are at low energy. The most cited result on the DIS cross section is one from Gargamelle [38], which reported \u03bd e -nucleon cross sections up to 12 GeV. At higher energies, E53 [39] reported \u03bd e -\u03bd \u03bc universality in their neutrino cross sections. DONuT [40] also reported consistency with lepton universality. There is no direct data available for \u03bd e energies above 250 GeV. An indirect bound has been reported by HERA [41], which studied the reaction e \u2212 p \u2192 \u03bd e X and showed that their results are consistent with the SM and constrain the inverse reaction of \u03bd e p interactions, where the equivalent fixed target neutrino energy is 50 TeV. \u03bd \u03bc : Muon neutrinos have been intensively studied thanks to the ease with which they are produced and detected. Data from accelerator-based experiments exist up to neutrino energies of 360 GeV [42]. Using atmospheric neutrinos, IceCube has constrained cross sections for neutrino energies above 6.3 TeV, albeit with relatively large uncertainties [43,44]. The neutrino energy range between 360 GeV and 6.3 TeV is unexplored. \u03bd \u03c4 : The tau neutrino is the least studied neutrino. DONuT [40] is the only experiment that has reported the DIS  where N refers to an isoscalar nucleon in the target, and the expected energy spectra of neutrinos that interact in FASER\u03bd. For all three flavors, the FASER\u03bd energy spectra, shown as colored histograms, are peaked at energies that are currently unconstrained. Left, \u03bd e constraints: Bounds from E53 [39] and DONuT [40]. The bounds from E53 on \u03c3 \u03bde /\u03c3 \u03bd\u03bc and \u03c3\u03bd e /\u03c3\u03bd \u03bc are multiplied by the current values of \u03c3 \u03bd\u03bc and \u03c3\u03bd \u03bc , respectively. Center, \u03bd \u03bc constraints: Bounds from accelerator neutrinos at energies below 360 GeV [42] and from IceCube at energies above 6.3 TeV [43,44]. From Ref. [43]. Right, \u03bd \u03c4 constraints: The constraint on the energy-independent part of the cross section C from DONuT [40] is shown (see text). DONuT's main systematic uncertainty from the D s differential production cross section is not included. For OPERA [45], SuperKamiokande [46], and IceCube [47], we indicate the energy ranges of \u03bd \u03c4 cross section results, but not the measured cross sections themselves (see text)",

In recent years, especially since the shutdown of the Tevatron in 2011, the focus of precision neutrino studies has been on low energies below 10 GeV [48][49][50]. The goal of these studies is primarily to constrain the \u03bd e and \u03bd \u03bc cross sections to minimize systematic uncertainties for neutrino oscillation experiments [51][52][53]. At these energies, nuclear effects play an important role, and it is desirable to measure the cross sections experimentally.",

In contrast, the light hadrons are long-lived and decay downstream from the IP, which requires us to model their propagation and absorption in the LHC beam pipe. The forward LHC infrastructure [70] is shown in the bottom left panel of Fig. 1. Located about 20 m downstream from the IP is the TAS front quadrupole absorber, a 1.8 m-long copper block with an inner radius of 17 mm that essentially absorbs all hadrons traveling at angles relative to the beam axis of \u03b8 > 0.85 mrad. The TAS shields the inner triplet of quadrupole magnets (Q1-3) and the separator dipole magnet (D1). 1 The inner triplet consists of two MQXA quadrupoles (Q1 and Q3), oriented in the same direction as each other and orthogonal to the two MQXB magnets (Q2a and Q2b). Both the MQXA and MQXB magnets have field gradients of magnitude 205 T/m and apertures of diameter 70 mm [71]. The D1 magnet has a field strength of 3.5 T and an aperture of diameter 60 mm, and it is located 59\u221283 m downstream. In particular, the dipole magnet will deflect charged particles so that they are not moving towards FASER and will eventually collide with the beam pipe. Located \u223c 140 m downstream is the TAN neutral particle absorber [72], which absorbs photons and neutral hadrons produced in the forward direction. For the purpose of this study, we ignore the variable beam crossing angle. A beam half crossing angle of 150 \u03bcrad shifts the position of the beam collision axis by 7.2 cm at FASER and leads to a small (3-10%) reduction in the number of neutrinos interacting in FASER\u03bd, where the exact reduction depends on the neutrino flavor.",

We separate the different processes contributing to neutrino production into pion (blue), kaon (red), hyperon (orange), charm (dark green), and bottom (light green) decays. The two-body decays of charged pions \u03c0 \u00b1 \u2192 \u03bc\u03bd \u03bc and kaons K \u00b1 \u2192 \u03bc\u03bd \u03bc are the dominant sources of \u03bd \u03bc production. Note that kaon decays provide a larger contribution at higher energies due to the larger fraction of the parent meson energy obtained by the neutrino in kaon decays. Electron neutrinos are predominantly produced in three-body kaon decays K \u2192 \u03c0 e\u03bd e , with K \u00b1 , K L , and K S providing similar contributions.",

The rates are normalized to the interaction rate per area at the beam collision axis. We can see that the \u03bd \u03bc beam is the most collimated with an event rate that falls off steeply for distances from the beam axis larger than about 10 cm. Electron neutrinos are mainly produced in kaon decay and inherit a slightly broader spectrum. Tau neutrinos are produced in the decay of heavy flavor hadrons, resulting in the least collimated beam. 3 In contrast, the flux of high-energy muons increases away from the beam collision axis. These muons, coming from the direction of the IP, are deflected by the LHC magnets causing an effective \"shadow\" along the beam collision axis and hence at the FASER location. As we will see below in Sect. 5.1, a FLUKA background study predicts an increase in the muon rate (and muon-associated backgrounds) of roughly a factor of 10\u2212100 between the beam collision axis and a location \u223c 1 m displaced from it. We therefore see that a small detector, with a radial size of O(10 cm) placed on the beam collision axis has many advantages for neutrino searches.",

A typical emulsion detector consists of silver bromide crystals with diameters of 200 nm dispersed in gelatin media. Each crystal works as an independent detection channel. The high density of detection channels (of the order of 10 14 /cm 3 ) makes emulsion detectors unique for detecting short-lived particles.

Let us therefore first look at some key features of high-energy neutrino interactions, which we can then use to identify a neutrino interaction and measure the neutrino energy. For the studies presented in this work, the Genie Monte Carlo v2.12.10 simulation package [92,93] was used to generate events with the required neutrino flux and flavor spectrum interacting with a tungsten target nucleus. The \"Valenci-aQEBergerSehgalCOHRES\" model configuration was used, but we note that the differences between Genie model configurations are focused on low-energy transfer physics (\u03bd \u223c 1 GeV), not on the high-energy transfers that make up the majority of interactions in FASER\u03bd. In Genie, the deepinelastic scattering model, which dominates the cross section at the relevant neutrino energies, is based on Bodek-Yang [94], which uses parton distribution functions tuned to data from e/\u03bc scattering on hydrogen and deuterium targets. Nuclear corrections are included based on charged lepton and neutrino scattering data on iron targets [95]. Hadronization is governed by Genie's \"AKGY\" model [96], which uses PYTHIA6 [66] for the invariant masses W \u2265 3 GeV that are most relevant for FASER\u03bd. The high-W model is tuned to BEBC data on measured neutrino-hydrogen particle multiplicities [97], although other authors have found better agree-ment with other datasets by retuning the model [98]. Final State Interactions, where particles produced at the interaction vertex can re-interact before leaving the nucleus, are modelled with Genie's INTRANUKE \"hA\" intranuclear cascade model [99], which is tuned to \u03c0 -iron and \u03c0 -nucleon scattering data, and is then extrapolated to other targets with A 2/3 scaling, where A is the atomic number. An important deficiency of Genie's intranuclear cascade is that particles are transported through the nucleus independently, so cannot feel the potential from other interaction products. A comparison of the various available simulation packages and \u03c0 -nucleus scattering data can be found in Ref. [100]. Genie provides default cross section splines that range up to 100 GeV. To generate neutrino interactions at higher energies, the cross section splines were pre-computed by using a dedicated tool implemented in Genie (gmkspl).",

Although this result is promising, more careful study of the interaction generator is needed to understand and quantify the uncertainties of the energy estimation, for example due to the modeling of the nuclear corrections, hadronization, and final state interactions. The currently used modeling in Genie has not been validated for neutrino interactions with tungsten at the energies relevant for FASER\u03bd. Such a validation would include a cross-check between the visible energy method and ANN method at lower energy E < 1 TeV. Additionally, so far the energy measurement with the ANN algorithm has been tested only for \u03bd \u03bc CC events.

However, there may be significant advantages to coupling FASER\u03bd to the FASER main detector (spectrometer) by using additional silicon tracker layers at the interface of FASER\u03bd with the main detector, as shown in Fig. 12. Such a hybrid emulsion/counter detector was successfully used in detecting neutrino interactions in a series of experiments [40,83,84,87,88]. The FASER spectrometer can provide charge information and is also useful to improve the energy resolution. Moreover, a scintillator that is upstream of the emulsion detector provides an additional opportunity to identify an incoming muon, and so aids in differentiating muon-induced backgrounds from neutrino interaction events.",

One is the angle \u03c6 between the HMP and the vectorial sum of momenta of all the other tracks, measured in the two-dimensional transverse plane. As the lepton and hadron systems have back-to-back kinematics in this plane, \u03c6 is expected to peak at 180 \u2022 .

The HMP is selected among the charged particles that pass at least 2\u03bb int , which eliminates 86% of hadrons. As a result, for NC and neutral hadron interactions, the ratio P HMP / n i P i peaks at small values.

Here the fiducial volume is defined to be the front 80% of the FASER\u03bd detector, which leaves at least two interaction lengths after the vertex for muon identification. In addition, a high event sample purity, weighted by the expected event rates, can be achieved, with N CC /(N CC + N NC + N neutral hadron ) = 86%. The purity increases for the case where the muon traverses more than 2 \u03bb int . Also, the higher the energy, the lower the contamination from neutron background. \u03bd e CC events An outgoing electron produced in the CC interaction of a high-energy electron neutrino will promptly initiate an EM shower, which can be easily distinguished from other charged tracks coming from the vertex. This greatly reduces the impact of any potential neutralhadron-induced background for \u03bd e CC interactions. In particular, high-energy EM showers could be initiated by decays of neutral pions, \u03c0 0 \u2192 \u03b3 \u03b3 , when pions are produced in scatterings of neutral hadrons. However, these can be efficiently discriminated from singleelectron-initiated showers based on the corresponding shower development and energy deposition in consecutive emulsion films. At the same time, we have verified, using simulations with the Qgsjet-ii-04 MC generator, that backgrounds from neutron interactions to \u03bd e , in which a high-energy electron with E e > 100 GeV emerges from a neutron interaction vertex, are negligible, of order one per mille for 1 TeV neutron interaction. In addition, most of such background electrons come from 3-body decays of final-state pions, \u03c0 \u2192 \u03b3 ee, produced in neutron scatterings.

Muon-neutrino CC interactions are therefore expected to be a negligible background to \u03bd e CC events. \u03bd \u03c4 CC events In case of CC interactions of \u03c4 neutrinos, it is essential to exploit an additional signal feature associated with the displaced secondary vertex coming from decays of \u03c4 lepton. Possible sources of background for such a signature include NC interactions of other (dominant) neutrino flavors or neutral hadrons producing hadrons that could lead to a secondary displaced interaction vertex in the detector. However, these secondary vertices are typically characterized by a large track multiplicity, making it less probable for them to mimic, e.g., a 1-prong (high-energy) \u03c4 vertex. Another source of background is CC muon/electron neutrino interactions with failed muon/electron identification, especially when there is associated charm production in the neutrino interaction vertex. Notably, this was an important source of background for the \u03bd \u03c4 searches performed by the OPERA experiment, because of the inefficiency of muon identification for low-energy muons. On the other hand, muon identification is much improved thanks to long high-energy \u03bc tracks in FASER\u03bd, which allows one to significantly suppress this background. In addition, the aforementioned \u03c6 angle is again a powerful discriminator of \u03bd \u03c4 from the NC, charm, and neutralhadron-induced backgrounds, as it is typically large for outgoing \u03c4 leptons from the neutrino scattering events in contrast to the HMPs produced in background events.",

The transverse dimensions were 12.5 cm \u00d7 10 cm for each module. The modules were installed in plastic boxes and placed side by side on the beam collision axis, as shown in the left panel of Fig. 17. The pilot neutrino detector collected 12.5 fb \u22121 of data from September to October 2018. During this time, about 40 \u03bd \u03bc CC interactions were expected to occur in the detector. The central panel of Fig. 17 shows a part of the reconstructed data. A track density of 3 \u00d7 10 5 tracks/cm 2 was observed. To find vertices in this data, we required multiple charged particles emerging from one point, and several vertex candidates were selected in a sub-sample analysis. The right panel of Fig. 17 shows a vertex candidate that was found in a sub-sample of analyzed data, which has no charged incoming particle. Such events demon-strate the capability of FASER\u03bd to observe LHC neutrinos. Further details will be reported in future publications [34].",

Directly detecting a \u03bd \u03c4 requires that the neutrino beam has enough energy to produce a \u03c4 lepton (E \u03bd > 3.5 GeV), which must then be identified. As \u03c4 leptons are shortlived (c\u03c4 = 87 \u00b5m) and their decays always involve tau neutrinos, which escape measurement, the identification of \u03c4 leptons is extremely difficult. DONuT and OPERA have observed \u223c 10 \u03bd \u03c4 events each [40,45], and these datasets provide the primary information about tau neutrinos at present. Although SuperKamiokande and IceCube have recently reported higher statistics \u03bd \u03c4 appearance in atmospheric oscillations [46,47], care must be taken when interpreting the physics in these cases as identification is only made through statistical means. In addition, those measurements rely on knowing the flux of atmospheric neutrinos, which has large uncertainties. As a result, despite the larger number of events, the resulting \u03bd \u03c4 cross section constraints from SuperKamiokande and IceCube are at the \u223c 30% uncertainty level and comparable to OPERA. One also has to take into account that the measurements from oscillated \u03bd \u03c4 neutrinos are at comparatively low energies (E \u03bd < 70 GeV), while DONuT observed neutrino interactions in the fully DIS regime. In the future, the proposed SHiP beam dump experiment at CERN [117] may provide high statistics \u03bd \u03c4 measurements up to E \u03bd 150 GeV.",

We see that, depending on the energy, 10-20% of neutrino interactions at FASER\u03bd produce a charm hadron, leading to a large event sample for these processes. Previous measurements obtained in the CHORUS and E531 experiments, probing neutrino energies E \u03bd < 200 GeV below FASER\u03bd's sensitivity, are shown as gray error bars [128]. Note that since these measurements use a different target material and a beam with different neutrino/anti-neutrino ratio, and therefore cannot be directly compared with the FASER\u03bd predictions. A similar search can be performed for beauty-hadronassociated neutrino interactions. In the SM, these processes are suppressed by O(V 2 ub ) 10 \u22125 , and the expected number of beauty-associated neutrino interactions is O(0.1) in Run 3.

As we have seen earlier, the different hadronic interaction models differ at the 10-50% level, depending on the flavor and energy, and therefore measurements of the neutrino spectrum at FASER\u03bd could help validate and improve these models. This is particularly interesting for neutrino production via heavy meson decays, which is sensitive to the poorly constrained charm parton distribution function. Besides the perturbative component described by DGLAP evolution, a sizable non-perturbative contribution to the charm parton distribution function is possible. We consider five parameterizations of this intrinsic charm component, as implemented in the CT14nnlo-IC parton distribution function [134]. The BHPS model predicts a \"valence-like\" intrinsic charm component, peaking around momentum fraction x \u223c 0.3, which will lead to an enhancement of forward high-energy charmhadron production. The SEA model is parameterized by a \"sea-like\" non-perturbative function that is proportional to the light quark distributions.",

The colored lines correspond to the five intrinsic charm parameterizations in CT14nnlo-IC [134]. We see that an intrinsic charm component can significantly enhance the neutrino production rate in the regions where neutrino production in charmed hadron decay dominate: the high-energy regime of electron neutrino production, as well as tau neutrino production. The intrinsic charm parameterization shown in the right panel of Fig. 19 predicts an enhancement of up to a factor of 10 for the tau neutrino rate. In con- charm quarks contribute to the neutrino interaction. Right: The event topology of \u03bd \u03c4 CC interactions that produce beauty hadrons.

IceCube has measured an as-of-yet unidentified highenergy component of the neutrino flux [139]. The dominant background to this new flux at lower energies is the conventional (from pion and kaon decays) atmospheric flux. There is also a prompt component of the atmospheric flux from the decay of heavy mesons that is expected to become dominant at higher energies, although no evidence of it has been found in the data so far as IceCube's constraints push down on theoretical models that have been very difficult to calculate [140][141][142].

This is conservative compared the expected neutrino energy resolution of FASER\u03bd, which is approximately 30% (see Fig. 11). In addition, although the LHC is not a point neutrino source, the fact that neutrinos are created at different locations has an effect on L/E that is smaller than the effect of the neutrino energy resolution and so is safely neglected. We calculate the sensitivity to sterile neutrinos assuming an integrated luminosity of 150 fb \u22121 . To estimate our systematic uncertainties, we marginalize over the production uncertainties using a pull term [145] in the following way. We assume that the reality is the average of the hadronic models and then take the upper and lower limits from the different models as the standard deviation of a Gaussian prior. Note that here we only consider production uncertainties discussed in Sect. 3. Additional uncertainties, for example related to the detector response, require a careful study and are not considered at this moment. The contours are shown in Fig. 22 along with some previous constraints and anomalies from other neutrino experiments.",

Additionally, if FASER\u03bd is interfaced with the FASER spectrometer, one could also search for LLPs produced in FASER\u03bd and decaying in the FASER decay volume, probing decay lengths of c\u03c4\u03b2\u03b3 \u223c 1 m. Such searches are particularly interesting if the LLP is also produced in neutrino or dark matter interactions [163], leading to a neutral vertex in FASER\u03bd. An example of such a model, which could also explain the MiniBooNE anomaly [150], has been discussed in Ref. [164] and consists of both a heavy neutral lepton and a dark photon with a lifetime that is appropriate for FASER\u03bd. Finally, FASER\u03bd could be sensitive to a additional neutrino production modes, for example via the decay of light mediators into \u03c4 -neutrinos.",

In this study, we have reported detailed estimates of the neutrino fluxes and interaction rates in FASER\u03bd, and we have presented the expected features and capabilities of the FASER\u03bd emulsion detector. Detailed considerations of event features can yield a reconstructed neutrino energy resolution of 30% and angular resolution of \u223c 3\u22125 mrad for CC \u03bd \u03bc interactions. Neutrino CC events can be identified by requiring neutral vertices with 5 or more charged tracks, including a high-energy lepton, and requiring very high energies and tracks pointing back to the ATLAS IP greatly suppresses backgrounds. Furthermore, the FASER\u03bd emulsion detector module can be interfaced with the FASER spectrometer, which will provide the possibility to distinguish \u03bd \u03bc from\u03bd \u03bc through muon charge identification, as well as better energy reconstruction and background suppression.",

These observations will have interesting implications for other fields. For example, the measurement of forward neutrino production will be a key input for high-energy neutrino measurements by large-scale Cherenkov observatories, such as IceCube, and observations of high-energy scattering rates will constrain poorly understood nuclear effects in highenergy lepton-nucleus interactions. Finally, FASER\u03bd will probe new physics, in particular because the flavor-sensitive detector design will allow studies of channels including \u03c4 , charm and beauty, which could be excellent probes of BSM effects in heavy flavor particles.",

Note, however, that the muon rate at the FASER location was estimated with FLUKA for both LHC and HL-LHC optics, and the results were compatible. This suggests that beam optics changes between the LHC and HL-LHC will not have a big effect on neutrino production.",
