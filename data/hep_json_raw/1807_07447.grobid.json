Events are classified according to their final state into many event classes. For each event class an automated search algorithm tests whether the data are compatible with the Monte Carlo simulated expectation in several distributions sensitive to the effects of new physics. The significance of a deviation is quantified using pseudoexperiments. A data selection with a significant deviation defines a signal region for a dedicated follow-up analysis with an improved background expectation. The analysis of the data-derived signal regions on a new dataset allows a statistical interpretation without the large look-elsewhere effect. The sensitivity of the approach is discussed using Standard Model processes and benchmark signals of new physics. As an example, results are shown for 3.2 fb \u22121 of protonproton collision data at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV collected with the ATLAS detector at the LHC in 2015, in which more than 700 event classes and more than 10 5 regions have been analysed. No significant deviations are found and consequently no data-derived signal regions for a follow-up analysis have been defined.",

            "text": "General searches without an explicit BSM signal assumption have been been performed by the D\u00d8 Collaboration [1][2][3][4] at the Tevatron, by the H1 Collaboration [5,6] at HERA, and by the CDF Collaboration [7,8] at the Tevatron. At the LHC, preliminary versions of such searches have been performed by the ATLAS Collaboration at \u221a s = 7, 8 and 13 TeV, and by the CMS Collaboration at \u221a s = 7 and 8 TeV. This paper outlines a strategy employed by the ATLAS Collaboration to search in a systematic and (quasi-)modelindependent way for deviations of the data from the SM prediction. This approach assumes only generic features of the potential BSM signals. Signal events are expected to have reconstructed objects with relatively large momentum transverse to the beam axis. The main objective of this strategy is not to finally assess the exact level of significance of a deviation with all available data, but rather to identify with a first dataset those phase-space regions where significant deviations of the data from SM prediction are present for a further dedicated analysis. The observation of one or more significant deviations in some phase-space region(s) serves as a trigger to perform dedicated and model-dependent analyses where these 'data-derived' phase-space region(s) can be used as signal regions. Such an analysis can then determine the level of significance using a second dataset. The main advantage of this procedure is that it allows a large number of phase-space regions to be tested with the available resources, thereby minimizing the possibility of missing a signal for new physics, while simultaneously maintaining a low false discovery rate by testing the data-derived signal region(s) on an independent dataset in a dedicated analysis. The dedicated analysis with data-derived signal regions also allows an improved background prediction.",

A data selection can be any set of requirements on objects or variables needed to define a signal region (e.g. an event class or a specific range in one or multiple observables). In order to search for these signals a large variety of data selections need to be tested. This requires a high degree of automation and a categorization of the data events according to their main features. The main objective of this analysis is to identify selections for which the data deviates significantly from the SM expectation. These selections can then be applied as data-derived signal regions in a dedicated analysis to determine the level of significance using a new dataset. This has the advantage of a more reliable background expectation, which should allow an increase in signal sensitivity compared to a strategy that only relies on Monte Carlo expectations with a typically conservative evaluation of uncertainties.

The number of event classes (686) and the m inv distributions used to generate these pseudo-experiments coincide with the example application in Sect. 3. The distribution in Fig. 1 with circular markers is the fraction of pseudo-experiments with at least one p channel -value smaller than p min . For example, about 15% of the pseudo-experiments have at least one p channelvalue smaller than p min = 10 \u22124 . Therefore, the estimated probability (P exp,i ) of obtaining at least one p channel -value (i = 1) smaller than 10 \u22124 from data in the absence of a signal is about 15%, or P exp,1 (10 \u22124 ) = 0.15. To estimate the probability of observing deviations of a given size in at least two or three different event classes, the second or third smallest p channel -value of a pseudo-experiment is compared with a given p min threshold. From Fig. 1 it follows for instance that 2% of the pseudo-experiments have at least three p channel -values smaller than 10 \u22124 . Consequently, the probability of obtaining a third smallest p channel -value smaller than 10 \u22124 from data in the absence of a signal is about 2%, or P exp,3 (10 \u22124 ) = 0.02",

This avoids ambiguities in the application of trigger efficiency corrections to MC simulations and avoids variations in the acceptance within an event class. The flow diagram in Fig. 2 gives a graphical representation of the trigger and offline event selection, based on the class of the event. Since the thresholds for the single-photon and single-jet triggers are higher than the p T requirements in the photon and jet object selection, an additional reconstruction-level p T cut is imposed to avoid trigger inefficiencies. For the other triggers, the p T requirements in the object definitions exceed the trigger thresholds by a sufficient margin to avoid additional trigger inefficiencies. Electrons are considered before muons in the event selection hierarchy because the electron trigger efficiency is considerably higher compared to the muon trigger efficiency.",

As a figure of merit, the fraction of 'signal' pseudo-experiments with P exp,i < 5% for i = 1, 2, 3 is computed. Figure 6 shows how removing the W Z process from the background prediction affects the three smallest expected p channel -values. In Fig. 6a, b, the dashed curves show the nominal expected p channel distribution obtained from pseudoexperiments. These define the p min thresholds for which P exp,i < 5% and vertical dotted lines are drawn at the threshold values. The solid lines show the p channel distributions obtained by testing pseudo-experiments generated from the SM prediction against the modified background prediction which has the W Z diboson process removed. It can be observed that in this case the m eff scan is more sensitive; the The fraction of pseudo-experiments which have at least one, two and three p channel -values below a given p min , given for both the pseudoexperiments generated from the nominal SM expectation and tested against the nominal expectation (dashed) and for those tested against the modified expectation ('SM, tt\u03b3 removed') in which the tt\u03b3 process is removed ( fraction of 'signal' pseudo-experiments with P exp,i < 5% is about 80% in all three cases i = 1, 2, 3.

For all three cases (i = 1, 2, 3), P exp,i < 5% is found again. This means that a dedicated analysis would be performed for the three event classes in which the p channel -values are observed, i.e. 3\u03bc, 1\u03bc2e1 j, and 2\u03bc1e1 j, likely resulting in the discovery of an unexpected signal due to W Z production. Figure 6c,   d shows the m eff distributions of the data with the full SM prediction and the modified prediction respectively. This test uses the conclusion from Sect. 3.6 and is performed in retrospect. In the case of a significant deviation, this test would be performed with pseudo-data to assess the sensitivity of the search to a missing background. Figure 7 shows the effect of removing the tt + \u03b3 process.

Gluinos undergo a cascade decay process to the lightest neutralino, which is undetected and leads to missing transverse momentum. It is not possible to fully reconstruct an event from gluino pair production due to the presence of neutralinos in the final state.

The sensitivity increases to about 1.1 TeV if the integrated luminosity of the two datasets combined is increased to about 10 fb \u22121 by doubling the size of the second dataset to 6.4 fb \u22121 . ATLAS has determined the discovery sensitivity of the dedicated searches for gluinos decaying to quarks, a W boson and a neutralino. This dedicated search estimates a local significance (i.e. not corrected for trial factors of the dedicated searches) of 5\u03c3 with a luminosity of 10 fb \u22121 for gluinos with a mass of 1.35 TeV assuming a systematic uncertainty of 25% [51].",

Events are classified according to their final state into many event classes. For each event class an automated search algorithm tests whether the data is compatible with the Monte Carlo simulated Standard Model expectation in several distributions sensitive to the effects of new physics. For each distribution the search algorithm is repeated on many pseudoexperiments to make a frequentist estimate of the statistical significance of the three largest deviations. A data selection in which a significant deviation is observed defines a dataderived signal region which will be tested on a new dataset in a dedicated analysis with an improved background model. The strategy has been applied to the data collected by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC during 2015, corresponding to a total of 3.2 fb \u22121 of 13 TeV pp collisions. In this dataset, exclusive event classes containing electrons, muons, photons, b-tagged jets, non-b-tagged jets and missing transverse momentum have been scanned for deviations from the MC-based SM prediction in the distributions of the effective mass and the invariant mass. Sensitivity studies with various toy signals (tt + \u03b3 , W Z, gluino, and Z production) have shown that the strategy could discover signals for new physics without an a priori knowledge of the existence of the processes.",

[65]. The top quark mass was set to 172.5 GeV. The h damp parameter, which regulates the transverse momentum of the first extra emission beyond the Born configuration and thus controls the p T of the tt system, was set to the mass of the top quark. Electroweak t-channel single-top-quark events were generated using the Powheg-Box v1 generator. This generator uses the four-flavour scheme for the NLO matrixelement calculations together with the fixed four-flavour PDF set CT10f4. For all top-quark processes, top-quark spin correlations are preserved (for the single-top t-channel, top quarks were decayed using MadSpin [66]). An alternative sample of tt was generated with the Sherpa 2.1.1 generator, including up to one additional parton at NLO and up to four additional partons at LO accuracy, interfaced to the parton shower using the ME+PS@NLO prescription. The parton shower (PS), fragmentation, and the underlying event of the Powheg-Box samples were simulated using Pythia 6.428 [67] with the CTEQ6L1 PDF set and the corresponding Perugia 2012 tune (P2012) [68]. The tt and single-top-quark events were normalized to the NNLO cross-section including the resummation of soft gluon emission at next-to-next-to-logarithm accuracy [69][70][71] using Top++2.0 [72]. Both the default and the alternative tt samples were corrected to reproduce the NNLO prediction [73,74] of the top quark p T and the p T of the tt system. The contribution of tt + bb was generated separately with Sherpa 2.1.1 at NLO; the calculation was performed in the four-flavour scheme and with the CT10f4 PDF set.",

The modelling uncertainty for \u03b3 + jets is estimated from scale variations with the same methodology as for the V + jets samples.

Tighter requirements on the lepton candidates are imposed, which are then referred to as 'signal' electrons or muons and are used further in the analysis, i.e. to establish the accuracy of the background modelling processes or to classify the events. Signal electrons must satisfy a tight likelihood-based identification requirement [44,83]. Signal muons must fulfil the requirement of |d 0 |/\u03c3 (d 0 ) < 3. The track associated with a signal lepton must have a longitudinal impact parameter relative to the reconstructed primary vertex, z 0 , satisfying |z 0 \u2022 sin \u03b8 | < 0.5 mm. Isolation requirements are applied to both the signal electrons and muons. The calorimeter isolation is computed as the sum of the energies of calorimeter energy clusters in a cone of size R = 0.2 around the lepton. Track isolation is defined as the scalar sum of the p T of tracks within a variable-size cone around the lepton, in a cone of size R = 0.2 (0.3) for electron (muon) trans-verse momenta p T < 50 GeV ( p T < 33 GeV) and of size R = 10 GeV/ p T for p T > 50 GeV ( p T > 33 GeV).

The uncertainty related to the modelling of E miss T in the simulation is estimated by propagating the uncertainties in the energy and momentum scale of each of the objects entering the calculation, with an additional uncertainty in the resolution and scale of the soft-term [41]. The uncertainties in correcting the efficiency of identifying jets containing b-hadrons in MC simulations are determined in data samples enriched in top quark decays, and in simulated events",

For each selection the p T , \u03b7, and \u03c6 distributions of the objects used in the selection and of additional jets are included as validation distributions by default. Additional validation distributions are listed per selection. In all cases, 'jet(s)' refers to both b-tagged and non-b-tagged jets, except where 'b-jet' is mentioned explicitly. H T (jets) is defined as the scalar p T sum of all the jets in the event. Some selections rely on the transverse mass (m T ( , E miss T )) which is defined as [2 p T ( ) E miss T",
