At the parton level of leadingorder (LO) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), Q and Q quarks are produced symmetrically. Next-to-leading order (NLO) QCD effects can introduce a small asymmetry of \u2248 1% in Q and Q momenta from interfering amplitudes. The hadronization process may also change the direction of the particle carrying the quark Q relative to the original Q direction and thus generate a significant asymmetry.",

            "text": "There have been few studies of this effect in bottom baryon production compared to bottom mesons. Production of heavy baryons is sensitive to effects of nonperturbative final state interactions of a QCD string connecting the b quark and a remnant of the proton. The production of the ground-state bottom baryon \u039b 0 b and its antiparticle \u039b 0 b has been recently discussed by Ros- * with visitors from a Augustana College, Sioux Falls, SD, USA, b The University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK, c DESY, Hamburg,  [2], who proposes the \"string drag\" mechanism that may favor production of \u039b 0 b baryons in the hemisphere containing the beam proton, and \u039b 0 b baryons in the antiproton beam hemisphere. In the string drag picture, the QCD interaction between a b quark produced in the pp collision and the remnant of the proton is described by a string with a linear potential. When the string breaks, it imparts an impulse to the quark along the beam axis. Assuming a string tension of 0.18 GeV 2 , Rosner made an approximate prediction for the shift in the particle longitudinal momentum relative to the axis along the beam direction of \u2206p z = 1.4 GeV, resulting in a shift in rapidity of approximately \u2206y = 1.4 GeV/E, where E is the energy of the particle and the rapidity is defined as y = ln((E + p z )/(E \u2212 p z ))/2. Another possible source of asymmetry in \u039b 0 b production is the coalescence of an intrinsic b quark at large momentum fraction x in the Fock state |uudbb of the proton with a comoving diquark ud from the proton [3].",

The uncertainty from the signal shape is estimated by comparing the results of the central fits with the results obtained when the width parameters for the forward and backward categories are constrained to be equal. The sensitivity to the background shape is estimated by increasing the lower mass requirement to M (J/\u03c8\u039b) > 5.2 GeV, thus excluding the mass range where feed-down from multi-body bottom baryon decays may be present. The estimate of the uncertainty on the detection efficiency is based on the average deviation from unity of the ratio R of reconstructed events in four rapidity intervals for a sample of MC events generated with no asymmetry. Adding the uncertainties in quadrature results in a total systematic uncertainty of \u00b14%. The systematic uncertainties are summarized in Table II.",

The \"Heavy Quark Recombination\" model [15], as shown in Fig. 2, predicts a modest asymmetry, reaching \u2248 2% near |y| = 2. While pythia predicts no asymmetry, the MC@NLO generator interfaced with Herwig predicts a large asymmetry, reaching 100% close to |y| = 2. Our results are consistent with no asymmetry within the large uncertainties, although they show a trend of increasing asymmetry with increasing |y| that could be interpreted as the effect of the longitudinal momentum imparted to a \u039b 0 b or \u039b 0 b particle by the beam remnant. Assuming a shift of \u2206p z = 1.4 GeV in the particle longitudinal momentum, as estimated by Rosner [2], we have simulated the effect by adding 1.4 GeV (\u22121.4 GeV) to the \u039b 0 b (\u039b 0 b ) baryon p z in the generated pythia events. As shown in Fig. 2, our result is in a good agreement with this prediction. We find our results in disagreement with the large asymmetry predicted by MC@NLO+Herwig.",
