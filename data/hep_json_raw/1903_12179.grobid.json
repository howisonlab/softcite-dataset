These tunes use the NNPDF3.1 parton distribution functions (PDFs) at leading (LO), next-to-leading (NLO), or nextto-next-to-leading (NNLO) orders in perturbative quantum chromodynamics, and the strong coupling evolution at LO or NLO. Measurements of charged-particle multiplicity and transverse momentum densities at various hadron collision energies are fit simultaneously to determine the parameters of the tunes. Comparisons of the predictions of the new tunes are provided for observables sensitive to the event shapes at LEP, global underlying event, soft multiparton interactions, and double-parton scattering contributions. In addition, comparisons are made for observables measured in various specific processes, such as multijet, Drell-Yan, and top quarkantiquark pair production including jet substructure observables. The simulation of the underlying event provided by the new tunes is interfaced to a higher-order matrix-element calculation. For the first time, predictions from pythia8 obtained with tunes based on NLO or NNLO PDFs are shown to reliably describe minimum-bias and underlying-event data with a similar level of agreement to predictions from tunes using LO PDF sets.",

The hard scattering component of the event consists of particles from the hadronization of partons whose kinematics are predicted using perturbative matrix elements (MEs), along with partons from initial-state radiation (ISR) and final-state radiation (FSR) that are simulated using a showering algorithm. The underlying event (UE) consists of the beam-beam remnants (BBR) and the particles that arise from multiple-parton interactions (MPI). The BBR are what remains after a parton is scattered out of each of the two initial beam hadrons. e-mail: cms-publication-committee-chair@cern.ch",

Generally, observables sensitive to the UE also receive contributions from the hard-scattering components. Accurately describing observables that are sensitive to the UE not only requires a good description of BBR and MPI, but also a good modeling of hadronization, ISR, and FSR. Standard MC event generators, such as pythia8 [1], herwig [2,3], and sherpa [4] have adjustable parameters to control the behavior of their event modeling. A set of these parameters, which has been adjusted to better fit some aspects of the data, is referred to as a tune.",

The MB observables are constructed from data with little or no additional selection requirements. The majority of MB collisions are soft, with a typical transverse momentum scale p T 2 GeV. The UE is defined as the activity that is not associated with the particles originating from the hard scattering of two partons and is generally studied in events that contain a hard scattering with p T 2 GeV. The main contribution to the UE comes from color exchanges between the beam partons and is modeled in terms of MPI, BBR, and color reconnection (CR).

On an event-by-event basis, a leading object is used to define regions of \u03b7-\u03c6 space that are sensitive to the modeling of the UE, where \u03b7 is the pseudorapidity and \u03c6 is the azimuthal scattering angle defined in the x y plane. The azimuthal separation between charged particles and the leading object, \u0394\u03c6 = \u03c6 \u2212 \u03c6 max , is used to define the UE-sensitive regions. Here \u03c6 max is the azimuth of the leading object and \u03c6 is the azimuth angle of an outgoing charged particle. On an event-byevent basis, transMAX (transMIN) is defined as the transverse region having the maximum (minimum) of either the number of charged particles, or scalar p T sum of charged particles ( p sum T ), depending on the quantity under study. Published UE studies used the charged-particle jet with the largest p T [16], the dilepton system in DY [20,21], or tt [22] events as the leading (i.e., the highest p T ) objects. The tunes from CDF and CMS data [9,10] made use of the charged particle with the largest p T ( p max T ) as the \"leading object\", and use only charged particles with p T > 0.5 GeV and |\u03b7| < 0.8 to characterize the UE. The toward region contains the leading object, and the away region is expected to include the object recoiling against the leading one. Most of the UE contributions, i.e., PS and MPI, are contained in the two transverse regions. For events with multiple ISR or FSR emissions, transMAX often contains a third hard jet, while both transMAX and transMIN receive contributions from the MPI and BBR components.

The primary hard-scattering processes and the MPI are regularized in the same way with this parameter. This threshold is expected to have a dependence on the center-ofmass energy of the hadron-hadron collision, \u221a s. The threshold at a reference center-of-mass energy \u221a s = 7 TeV is called pT0Ref. In pythia8 the energy dependence is parameterized using a power law function with a reference energy parameter s 0 and an exponent . At a given center-of-mass energy, the amount of MPI depends on the threshold p 0 T , the PDF, and the overlap of the matter distributions of the two colliding hadrons. Smaller values of p 0 T result in larger MPI contributions because of a higher MPI cross section. Each MPI adds colored partons to the final state, creating a dense net of color lines that spatially overlap with the fields produced by the partons of the hard scattering and with each other. All the generated color lines may connect to each other according to the CR model.",

In this simple approach, the UE in a hard-scattering process is related to MB collisions. At the same center-of-mass energy, the activity in the UE of a hardscattering process is greater than that of an average MB collision. In pythia8, this is caused by the higher MPI activity in hard-scattering processes compared to a typical MB collision. By demanding a hard scattering, one forces the collision to be more central, i.e., with a small impact parameter between the protons, and this increases the probability of MPI. For MB collisions, peripheral collisions, where the impact parameter between the two colliding protons is large, are most common.",

            "text": "Two of the basic input parameters to the predictions are the choice of the order of the PDF sets and values of the strong coupling \u03b1 S . These appear in the hard partonic MEs, the PS model, and the MPI model. The \u03b1 S values used in simulations at LO or NLO are typically different. Traditionally, the perturbative order of the PDF is matched to the order of the ME calculation. Merged calculations capture some higherorder corrections with respect to the formal order of the ME calculation. Merging schemes, such as the k T -MLM [31] or CKKW [32,33], allow the combination of predictions of jet production using ME calculations with those from PS emissions for soft and collinear parton radiation at leading-log accuracy without double counting or dead regions. Merging can be applied also for processes generated at NLO. Using the same PDF set and \u03b1 S value in the ME calculations and in the simulation of the various components of the PS is advocated in Ref. [34], and by the herwig7 and sherpa Collaborations, especially when the PS simulation is merged with calculations of higher-order MEs. The PDF used for the hard process is constrained by the accuracy of the ME calculation. If we require the PDF to match between the ME and PS, simulations with a (N)NLO ME will also require a (N)NLO PDF in the PS. Depending on the process, this may not have a significant effect. For PS MC event generators, dif-ferent strategies are adopted; CMS [5] and ATLAS [12] tunes are traditionally based on LO PDFs, pythia8 [6] tunes are mostly based on LO PDFs, new sherpa [4] tunes are based on NNLO PDFs, and herwig7 [30] provide tunes based on NLO PDFs. The usage of a LO PDF set in the UE simulation is motivated by the fact that MPI processes occur at very low energy scales, where a physical (positive) gluon distribution is required by the parton shower. However, there is no consensus on the choice of the order of the PDF. For example, in the NNPDF3.1 set at NNLO, the gluon distribution remains physical even at very low scales.",

In addition, we also use the charged-particle and p sum T densities as a function of the leading charged-particle p T , measured in transMIN and transMAX by CMS at \u221a s = 7 TeV [10] and by CDF at \u221a s = 1.96 TeV [9]. Tunes are determined by generating sets of predictions using the rivet [42] (version 2.5.2) and the professor [43] (version 1.4.0) frameworks with around 150 different choices of the five parameter values used in the event simulation. The predictions form a grid in the five-dimensional parameter space which is fitted using a third-order polynomial function. The uncertainty introduced in the fitted parameters due to the interpolation procedure is negligible compared with the quoted tune uncertainty. Results are found to be stable if one decreases this number to 100 or increases to 200, or uses a fourth-order polynomial function for the grid interpolation. The generated inelastic events include ND and diffractive (DD+SD+CD) contributions. The UE observables used to determine the tunes are sensitive to diffractive contributions only at very small p max T values (<3 GeV). The ND component is dominant for p max T values greater than \u2248 3.0 GeV, since the cross section of the diffractive components rapidly decreases as a function of the exchanged p T . Minimum-bias observables, such as the inclusive charged-particle multiplicity as a function of \u03b7, are sensitive to all contributions over the whole spectrum.",

The f i ( p) functions represent a parametrization of the dependence of the predictions in bin i on the tuning parameters, R i is the value of the measured observable in bin i, and \u0394 i is the total experimental uncertainty of R i . The best fit values of the tuned parameters are shown in Table 2 for CP1 and CP2, i.e., the tunes using LO PDF sets, and in Table 3 for CP3, CP4, CP5, i.e., the tunes using NLO or NNLO PDF sets. Uncertainties in the parameters of these tunes are discussed in Appendix A. No correlation across bins is included in the minimized \u03c7 2 function. The value of pT0Ref and its energy dependence is very different between tunes based on LO PDF sets and tunes based on NLO or NNLO PDFs. While pT0Ref is around 2.3-2.4 GeV for CP1 and CP2 tunes with \u2248 0.14-0.15, CP3, CP4, and CP5 tunes prefer much lower values for both pT0Ref (\u22481.4-1.5) and (\u22480.03-0.04). A value of of \u22480.03-0.04 corresponds to a very weak energy dependence of the threshold of the MPI cross section. These results can be understood by considering the shapes of the gluon densities at small x for the different PDF sets. In order to describe the UE observables, the rapidly increasing gluon densities at small x in LO PDF sets favor large values of pT0Ref. Meanwhile NLO and NNLO PDF sets, whose gluon densities are more flat at low x, need higher contributions of MPI, i.e., a small value of pT0Ref. Figure 3 shows the number of MPI observed for the various tunes and the gluon distribution at a reference scale of \u03bc = 3 GeV for various NNPDF versions. The larger number of simulated MPI for NLO and NNLO tunes with respect to LO tunes is apparent.",

The eigentunes (Appendix A) correspond to the tunes in which the changes in the \u03c7 2 (\u0394\u03c7 2 ) of the fit relative to the best fit value equals the \u03c7 2 value obtained in the tune, i.e., \u0394\u03c7 2 min = \u03c7 2 . Such a variation of the \u03c7 2 produces a tune whose uncertainty bands are roughly the same as the uncertainties in the fitted data points. This is the Fig. 4 The transMIN (upper left) charged-particle and charged p sum T (upper right) densities and the transMAX (lower left) charged-particle and charged p sum T (lower right) densities, as a function of the transverse momentum of the leading charged particle, p max T , from the CMS \u221a s = 13 TeV analysis [16]. Charged hadrons are measured with p T > 0.5 GeV in |\u03b7| < 2.0. The transMIN densities are more sensitive to the MPI, whereas the transMAX densities are more sensitive to ISR and FSR. The data are compared with the CMS pythia8 LO-PDF tunes CP1 and CP2. The ratios of the simulations to the data (MC/Data) are also shown, where the shaded band indicates the total experimental uncertainty in the data. Vertical lines drawn on the data points refer to the total uncertainty in the data. Vertical lines drawn on the MC points refer to the statistical uncertainty in the predictions. Horizontal bars indicate the associated bin width main motivation why this choice of variation was considered. For all tunes in Tables 2 and 3, the fit quality is good, with \u03c7 2 /dof values very close to 1.   Figure 10 shows the charged-particle multiplicity as a function of pseudorapidity for charged particles in |\u03b7| < 2 measured by the CMS experiment at \u221a s = 13 TeV [18] in MB events. These events were recorded with no magnetic field, so all particles irrespective of their p T are measured. Data are compared with the predictions of the new pythia8 tunes. All of them are able to reproduce the measurement at the same level of agreement, independently of the PDF used for the UE simulation. We could not find any MB or UE observable where the level of agreement between data and predictions from the different tunes is significantly different. In this section, comparisons of the predictions obtained with the new tunes to various experimental measurements performed by the CMS experiment are provided. Unless otherwise stated, the comparisons are made at \u221a s = 13 TeV. We compare the CMS UE tunes with MB and UE data measured at central and forward pseudorapidities that are not used in the fits. We examine how well multijet, Drell-Yan, and top quark observables are predicted by MC simulations using higher-order ME generators merged with pythia8 with the various new tunes. In this subsection, predictions of the new tunes are compared to event-shape observables measured at LEP, in electronpositron collisions. These observables are particularly sensitive to the value of \u03b1 FSR S (m Z ). Given the leptonic initial state, there is no effect coming from the values of the MPI, color reconnection, and ISR parameters.",

This shows that the number of charged particles produced in diffractive processes and inelastic collisions is simultaneously described by the new CMS tunes. Figure 13 also demonstrates that tunes based on NNPDF3.1 PDF sets at orders higher than LO adequately describe the MB data. Figure 14 shows the UE observables, i.e., charged-particle multiplicity and p sum T densities [16], as a function of the p T of the leading jet reconstructed using just charged particles. The observables shown in Fig. 14 are from events selected without requiring any NSD-or SD-enhanced selections. The CMS UE tunes describe well UE-sensitive data measured using the leading charged-particle jet for p T jet > 10 GeV. Tunes based on NLO or NNLO PDF sets, i.e., CP3, CP4, and CP5, describe the region at lower p T jet better than CP1 and CP2, which are based on LO PDF sets. Predictions obtained with CP1 and CP2 underestimate the UE observables by about \u224815-20%. Predictions obtained with CP3, CP4, and CP5 describe the UE in events characterized using the leading charged particle, as well as those characterized by the leading charged-particle jet, quite well.",

For these studies, the NLO dijet MEs implemented in the powheg event generator merged with the pythia8 simulation of the PS and UE are used. The merging between the powheg ME calculations and the pythia8 UE simulation is performed using the shower-veto procedure, which rejects showers if their transverse momentum is greater than the minimal p T of all final-state partons simulated in the ME (parameter p T hard = 2 GeV [53]). Variables in multijet events, such as  [24]. The data are compared with the CMS pythia8 LO-PDF tunes CP1 and CP2, the CMS pythia8 NLO-PDF tune CP3, and the CMS pythia8 NNLO-PDF tunes CP4 and CP5. The ratio of the simulations to the data (MC/Data) is also shown, where the shaded band indicates the total experimental uncertainty in the data. Vertical lines drawn on the data points refer to the total uncertainty in the data. Vertical lines drawn on the MC points refer to the statistical uncertainty in the predictions. Horizontal bars indicate the associated bin width jet transverse momenta or azimuthal dijet correlations, are expected to be less affected by MPI contributions, since jets at high p T (>100 GeV) mainly originate from the hard scattering or additional hard emissions, which are simulated in the powheg calculation by the ME formalism. However, the MPI contribution still has some impact because it adds an average energy offset to the event, which is then included in the jet reconstruction [54,55]. The predictions reproduce well inclusive jet cross sections as a function of jet p T at both central and forward jet rapidities, irrespective of the cone size (0.4 or 0.7) used for the jet clustering algorithm [56]. Figure 17 shows the normalized cross section [57] as a function of the azimuthal difference \u0394\u03c6 1,2 between the two leading jets for two different selections on the leading jet p T : 200 < p T < 300 GeV and 300 < p T < 400 GeV. The results indicate that UE tunes based on an NLO evaluation of \u03b1 S (m Z ) describe the data better than UE tunes based on LO evolution. In particular, the better agreement is driven by the lower value of \u03b1 ISR S (m Z ). In fact, predictions obtained with powheg merged with pythia8 with the CUETP8M1 or CP2 tune exhibit a strong jet decorrelation, due to a large contribution from emissions simulated from the PS, and they overestimate the cross sections at small and medium \u0394\u03c6 1,2 values (\u0394\u03c6 1,2 < 2.4). The PS component is reduced by the lower value of \u03b1 S (m Z ), which increases the degree of correlation between the selected jets, resulting in a better description of the data by predictions of the CP4 and CP5 tunes. The topology in the transverse plane of the physics objects measured in the final state is sensitive to contributions from DPS. In particular, the 4j analysis performed by the CMS experiment requires two jets at high p T (hard jets) and two jets at low p T (soft jets); the 2b2j measurement selects two jets originating from b quarks and two other jets (light-flavor jets). Both of them measured the \u0394S observable, defined as:",

In a geometrical approach, this cross section is related to the transverse size of the proton and to the total inelastic proton-proton (pp) cross section [64,65]. When no correlations among the partons inside the proton are present, \u03c3 eff is similar to the inelastic pp cross section. In this simple factorized approach, one expects \u03c3 eff to be independent of the partonic final states of the two hard processes occurring within the same collision.  [47].

Vertical lines drawn on the data points refer to the total uncertainty in the data. Vertical lines drawn on the MC points refer to the statistical uncertainty in the predictions. Horizontal bars indicate the associated bin width In pythia8, the value of \u03c3 eff is calculated by dividing the ND cross section by the so-called \"enhancement factor\", which depends on the parameters of the overlap matter distribution function and on pT0Ref [40]. For central pp collisions, the enhancement factor tends to be large, translating to a lower value of \u03c3 eff and a larger DPS contribution. For peripheral interactions, enhancement factors are small, giving large values of \u03c3 eff and a small DPS contribution. Table 4 shows the values of \u03c3 eff published by the CMS Collaboration for the 4j and the 2b2j measurements. A previous study [5] concluded that observables sensitive to semihard MPI and those sensitive to DPS cannot be described by a single set of parameters. Table 5 displays the \u03c3 eff values obtained from the new CMS UE tunes. The central values of \u03c3 eff are consistent among the new tunes and are slightly larger than the values of the DPS-based tunes [5]. Figure 18 shows the comparisons of predictions obtained from pythia8 with tunes CUETP8M1, CP2, CP4, and CP5 to the DPS observables measured in the 4j and 2b2j final states. Predictions from the CP2 tune based on a LO PDF set describe the central values better than the CP4 and CP5 tunes based on an NNLO PDF set or the old tune CUETP8M1. This is due to the different pT0Ref value used by CP2, CP4, and CP5, which determines the amount of simulated MPI. The value of the pT0Ref parameter is driven by the distribution of the gluon distribution function at low x, which is very different in LO and NNLO PDF sets. Additionally, predictions obtained with CP4 describe the DPS-sensitive observables better than CP5. This is due to the different rapidity ordering used for the PS emissions in the two tunes. By removing the rapidity ordering for the PS emissions (CP4), the simulation produces more radiation and decreases the correlation between the selected jet pairs compared to CP5. This reduced jet correlation tends to mimic a DPS event by producing low values of \u0394S. We have checked that the observables sensitive to color coherence, which were measured by the CMS experiment at \u221a s = 7 TeV [66], are well described by predictions from both CP4 and CP5 tunes, despite the difference in the rapidity ordering of the PS simulation between the two tunes. In the powheg configuration, the ME heavy quark production mode [36,39,68] is used. In this configuration, powheg simulates inclusive tt production at NLO, where the first additional jet is computed at LO, while mg5_amc performs the calculation with up to 2 additional jets at NLO, with a third jet simulated at LO. The powheg generator scales the real emission cross section by a damping function that controls the ME-PS merging and that regulates the highp T radiation.",

In the LO NNPDF3.1 set, \u03b1 S (m Z ) = 0.130, whereas for the NLO and NNLO NNPDF3.1 sets, \u03b1 S (m Z ) = 0.118. In general, the combination of contributions from multiple-parton interactions and parton-shower emissions is crucial to give a good description of variables measured in soft-collision events. The infrared threshold is relatively independent of center-of-mass energy when using NLO or NNLO PDF sets. Irrespective of the specific PDF used, predictions from the new tunes reproduce well the UE measurements at center-of-mass energies \u221a s = 1.96 and 7 TeV. A significant improvement in the description of UE measurements at 13 TeV is observed with respect to predictions from old tunes that were extracted using data at lower collision energies. For the first time, predictions based on higher-order PDF sets are shown to give a reliable description of minimum-bias (MB) and UE mea-  [21], and compared with the predictions obtained by an inclusive NLO ME calculated by mg5_amc, interfaced to the UE simulation of pythia8 with the CUETP8M1, CP2, CP4, and CP5 tunes.

The eigentunes refer to the variations of the tunes along each of the maximally independent directions in the parameter space, obtained by using the covariance matrix in the region of the best tune. The number of directions defined in the parameter space equals the number of free parameters n used in the fit and results into 2n parameter variations, i.e., eigentunes.

Therefore, a lower number of variations is preferred. Hence, two variations, one \"up\" and one \"down\", are defined. For the definition of the two variations, predictions using the parameters of the eigentunes are implemented for the UE observables at \u221a s = 13 TeV and their differences with respect to the central predictions are added in quadrature. This procedure is applied in each bin and tune uncertainties are estimated without any correlation across the different bins. Positive differences between central predictions and tune variations define the upper edge of the bin-by-bin uncertainty, while negative differences define the lower edge of the bin-by-bin uncertainty. By following the same approach used for the extraction of the central values of the new CMS pythia8 tunes, the upper edge is fitted to obtain the \"up variation\", while the \"down variation\" is obtained by fitting the lower edge. The parameters of the upand down-variations are listed in Table 6 for the tunes using LO PDF sets, and in Table 7 for the tunes using (N)NLO PDF sets. We checked that for a wide range of MB and UE observables at \u221a s = 13 TeV predictions from up-and downvariations, obtained by including the full set of eigenvalues, reproduce well the upper and the lower edge of the predic- Table 6 Parameters of the \"up-\" and \"down-\" variation eigentunes for the pythia8 CP1, and CP2 tunes   tions. Hence, tune uncertainties estimated by evaluating predictions of up-and down-variations represent a reliable way of estimating the systematic uncertainties in the tunes.
