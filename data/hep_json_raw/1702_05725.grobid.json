Inclusive and differential cross sections are measured for events containing a Z boson decaying to electrons or muons and produced in association with up to seven jets with p T > 30 GeV and |y| < 2.5. Predictions from different Monte Carlo generators based on leading-order and nextto-leading-order matrix elements for up to two additional partons interfaced with parton shower and fixed-order predictions at next-to-leading order and next-to-next-to-leading order are compared with the measured cross sections. Good agreement within the uncertainties is observed for most of the modelled quantities, in particular with the generators which use next-to-leading-order matrix elements and the more recent next-to-next-to-leading-order fixed-order predictions.",

            "text": "The measurement of the production of a Z boson 1 in association with jets, Z + jets, constitutes a powerful test of perturbative quantum chromodynamics (QCD) [1,2]. The large production cross section and easily identifiable decays of the Z boson to charged leptonic final states offer clean experimental signatures which can be precisely measured. Such processes also constitute a non-negligible background for studies of the Higgs boson and in searches for new phenomena; typically in these studies, the multiplicity and kinematics of the jets are exploited to achieve a separation of the signal of interest from the Standard Model (SM) Z + jets process. These quantities are often measured in control regions and subsequently extrapolated to the signal region with the use of Monte Carlo (MC) generators, which are themselves subject to systematic uncertainty and must be tuned and validated using data. Predictions from the most recent generators combine next-to-leading-order (NLO) multi-leg matrix elements with a parton shower (PS) and a hadronisation model. Fixedorder parton-level predictions for Z +jets production at nextto-next-to-leading order (NNLO) are also available [3][4][5][6].",

In this paper, proton-proton ( pp) collision data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3.16 fb \u22121 , collected at \u221a s = 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector during 2015, are used for measurements of the Z -boson production cross section in association with up to seven jets within a fiducial region defined by the detector acceptance. The Z boson is identified using its decays to electron or muon pairs (Z \u2192 e + e \u2212 , Z \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 ). Cross sections are measured separately for these two channels, and for their combination, as a function of the inclusive and exclusive jet multiplicity N jets and the ratio of successive inclusive jet multiplicities (N jets + 1)/N jets , the transverse momentum of the leading jet p jet T for several jet multiplicities, the jet rapidity y jet , the azimuthal separation between the two leading jets \u03c6 jj , the two leading jet invariant mass m jj , and the scalar sum H T of the transverse momenta of all selected leptons and jets.",

Similarly, for Z -boson production, higher-order QCD corrections were evaluated in the dilepton invariant mass range 66 < m < 116 GeV following the references given in the fifth column for the stated order, and extrapolation scaling factors were applied to match mass ranges used by each simulation as given in the first column. The theory uncertainties as given in the final column correspond to PDF and scale variations. The diboson samples include on-shell and off-shell W W , W Z and Z Z production. Recently, NNLO QCD predictions have been made available for the diboson processes [32,33]. However, these higher-order corrections have a negligible impact on this analysis and OpenLoops [35] matrix element generators. They are merged with the Sherpa parton shower [36] (with a matching scale of 20 GeV) using the ME+PS@NLO prescription [37]. A five-flavour scheme is used for these predictions. The NNPDF30NLO PDF set [38] is used in conjunction with a dedicated set of parton-shower-generator parameters (tune) developed by the Sherpa authors. This sample is used for the nominal unfolding of the data distributions, to compare to the cross-section measurements, and to estimate the systematic uncertainties.",

The BlackHat+Sherpa predictions use the CT14 PDF set [61] including variations of its eigenvectors at the 68% confidence level, rescaled from 90% confidence level using a factor of 1/1.645. The nominal predictions use a factorisation and renormalisation scale of H T /2 with uncertainties derived from the envelope of a common variation of the scales by factors of 0.5, 1/ \u221a 2, \u221a 2, and 2. The effects of PDF and scale uncertainties range from 1 to 4% and from 0.1 to 10%, respectively, for the cross sections of Z -boson production in association with at least one to four partons, and are included in the predictions which are provided by the BlackHat+Sherpa authors for the fiducial phase space of this analysis. Since these predictions are defined before the decay leptons emit photons via final-state radiation (Born-level FSR), corrections to the dressed level (where all photons found within a cone of size R = 0.1 of the lepton from the decay of the Z boson are included) are derived from MG5_aMC+Py8 CKKWL, separately for each kinematic observable used to measure cross sections, with associated systematic uncertainties obtained by comparing to the Alpgen+Py6 generator. This correction is needed in order to match the prediction to the lepton definition used in the measurements. The average size of these corrections is approximately \u22122%. To bring the prediction from parton to particle level, corrections for the non-perturbative effects of hadronisation and the underlying event are also calculated separately for each observable using the Sherpa v2.2 generator by turning on and off in the simulation both the fragmentation and the interactions between the proton remnants. The net size of the corrections is up to approximately 10% at small values of p jet T and vanishes for large values of p jet T . An uncertainty of approximately 2% for this correction is included in the total systematic uncertainty of the prediction.",

The uncertainties are estimated using a decorrelation scheme, resulting in a set of 19 independent parameters which cover all of the relevant calibration uncertainties. The jet energy scale is the dominant systematic uncertainty for all bins with at least one jet. The jet energy-resolution uncertainty is derived by oversmearing the jet energy in the simulation and using the symmetrised variations as the uncertainty. \u2022 Jet vertex tagger: The modelling of the output variable from the jet vertex tagger is validated using data events where the Z boson recoils against a jet. A percent-level correction is derived and its statistical and systematic uncertainties are used as additional uncertainties in the efficiency to select jets from the primary vertex [71]. \u2022 Pile-up: The imperfect modelling of the effects of pileup leads to acceptance changes at the percent level for different jet multiplicities. To assess this uncertainty, the average number of interactions per bunch crossing \u03bc is varied in simulation so that the behaviour of variables sensitive to pile-up matches that observed in data. \u2022 Luminosity: The cross sections have a 2.1% uncertainty from the measurement of the integrated luminosity, which is derived, following a methodology similar to that detailed in Refs.

Figure 3 shows a comparison of the electron and muon channels for the measured fiducial cross section as a function of the inclusive jet multiplicity and of the leading jet p T for inclusive Z + \u2265 1 jet events. This figure demonstrates that the results in the electron and muon channels are compatible and hence can be combined to improve the precision of the measurement. This figure also shows the result of this combination described below.",

The plots show the particle-level cross section with the generator predictions normalised to the inclusive NNLO cross sections in the top panel, accompanied by the ratios of the various predictions with respect to the data in the bottom panels. Uncertainties from the parton distribution functions and QCD scale variations are included in the BlackHat+Sherpa predictions, as described in Sect. 3.3.

The  13 TeV, 3.16 fb   The jet transverse momentum is a fundamental observable of the Z + jets process and probes pQCD over a wide range of scales. Moreover, understanding the kinematics of jets in events with vector bosons associated with several jets is essential for the modelling of backgrounds for other SM processes and searches beyond the SM. The leading jet p T distribution (which is correlated with the p T of the Z boson) in inclusive Z + \u2265 1, 2, 3, 4 jet events is shown in Fig. 5 and ranges up to 700 GeV. The LO generator MG5_aMC+Py8 CKKWL models a too-hard jet p T spectrum. This feature is known from studies of LO generators in pp collisions at lower centre-of-mass energies [11], and can be interpreted as an indication that the dynamic factorisation and renormalisation scale used in the generation is not appropriate for the full jet p T range. In contrast, the predictions from BlackHat+Sherpa, Sherpa 2.2, and MG5_aMC+Py8 FxFx, which are based on NLO matrix elements, are in agreement with the measured cross section within the systematic uncertainties over the full leading jet p T range. Alpgen+Py6 also shows good agreement with the measured data. The Z + \u2265 1 jet N jetti NNLO prediction models the spectrum for the Z + \u2265 1 jet events well.

The values H T or H T /2 are also commonly used choices for scales for higherorder perturbative QCD calculations. Large values for this quantity can result either from a small number of very energetic particles or from a large number of less energetic particles. Figure 7 shows the measured cross sections as a function of the H T distribution (up to 1400 GeV) in inclusive Z + \u2265 1 jet events. The predictions from Sherpa 2.2, Alp-gen+Py6 and MG5_aMC+Py8 FxFx describe well the H T distribution. The prediction from MG5_aMC+Py8 CKKWL describes well the turn-over in the softer part of the H T spectrum, but overestimates the contribution at large values of H T , in line with the overestimate of the cross sections for hard jets. The fixed-order Z + \u2265 1 jet prediction from Black-Hat+Sherpa underestimates the cross section for values of H T > 300 GeV, as observed in similar measurements at lower centre-of-mass energies [11,81], due to the missing contributions from events with higher parton multiplicities, which for large values of H T constitute a substantial portion of the data. Agreement is recovered by adding higher orders  Angular relations between the two leading jets and the dijet mass are frequently used to separate either heavier SM particles or beyond-SM physics from the Z + jets process. Figure 8 shows the differential cross section as a function of azimuthal angular difference between the two leading jets for Z + \u2265 2 jet events, \u03c6 jj . The tendency of the two jets to be back-to-back in the transverse plane is well modelled by all predictions. This figure also shows the measured cross sections as a function of the invariant mass m jj of the two leading jets for Z + \u2265 2 jet events. The shape of the dijet mass is modelled well by BlackHat+Sherpa, Sherpa 2.2, Alpgen+Py6, and MG5_aMC+Py8 FxFx, whereas MG5_aMC+Py8 CKKWL shows a harder spectrum.",

In general, the predictions are in good agreement with the observed cross sections and cross-section ratios within the uncertainties. Distributions which are dominated by a single jet multiplicity are modelled well by fixed-order NLO calculations, even in the presence of a jet veto at a low scale. The ME+PS generator MG5_aMC+Py8 CKKWL, which is based on LO matrix elements, models a too-hard jet spectrum, as observed in \u221a s = 7 TeV pp collisions. It however models well the inclusive jet multiplicity distribution over the full multiplicity range. The modelling of the jet p T and related observables is significantly improved by the ME+PS@NLO generators Sherpa 2.2 and MG5_aMC+Py8 FxFx, which use NLO matrix elements for up to two additional partons. The recent Z + \u2265 1 jet N jetti NNLO predictions describe well key distributions such as the leading jet p T and H T .

The Sherpa 2.2 samples are reweighted at generator level, such that the distribution of the leading jet p T at detector level matches that observed in the data.
