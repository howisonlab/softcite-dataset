However, current observations show the universe to be matter dominated. Baryogenesis provides a mechanism to generate the observed asymmetry and requires a number of conditions, one of which is the violation of CP symmetry [1]. The Standard Model (SM) naturally includes CP violation (CP V ) through complex phases induced by quark mixing. While measurements in the K 0 and B 0 d systems show excellent agreement with the SM predictions [2], the observed level of CP violation is far too small to yield the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry [3]. As such it is important to search for new sources of CP V beyond the SM. The B 0 s system is one possible source, since the effects of CP V are expected to be small in the SM [4], and can be significantly enhanced by new physics models [5,6,7,8,9].",

For an original bb state to produce like-sign dimuons in the final state, one of the quarks must have hadronised to a neutral meson, and then mixed prior to decay, while the other must decay without mixing. In fact, there is a second source of such muons: sequential semileptonic decays b \u2192 c\u00b5 \u2212 X \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 + X \u2032 .

The fundamental asymmetry being probed is unchanged by requiring a second muon, i.e. A b sl = a b sl . In this document, we present a measurement of A b sl , which takes advantage of the two different ways it can be extracted to minimise the total experimental uncertainty on the asymmetry.

The parameters A bkg , a bkg , K and k are determined in bins of muon transverse momenta, using data-driven methods wherever possible. Equations (4-6) are then used to extract A b sl separately for the inclusive and dimuon cases. Finally, the two measurements are combined, taking advantage of correlations in their uncertainties, to yield a single measurement of A b sl with significantly improved precision. We define all muons from weak decays of b and c quarks as signal, and all other muons (dominated by pion and kaon decay-in-flight) as background. The dilution coefficients are determined from Monte Carlo simulation, using the branching fractions and momentum spectra of signal processes to evaluate their relative contributions to the signal sample. Apart from the asymmetry-inducing semileptonic B decays, contributions from the following processes are taken into account in the simulation: sequential decays b \u2192 c \u2192 \u00b5 + X, decays b \u2192 ccq, cc and bbcc production, and the dimuon decays of narrow resonances, such as \u03b7, \u03c9, \u03c1 0 , \u03c6(1020) and J/\u03c8.

In each case, the total asymmetry is the product of the fraction f i of muons arising from this source, and the asymmetry a i associated with that source. The last term accounts for any remaining detector asymmetry, \u03b4, on the signal muon sample. The dominant source of asymmetry is the kaon term, since the K \u2212 meson has a significantly shorter interaction length in matter than the K + meson [2], and therefore has less chance of decaying to a muon. The resulting contribution to the raw asymmetry a is therefore positive, and at least a factor ten larger than any of the other three terms in Eq. 7. The asymmetry from kaons a K is measured in data using K * 0 \u2192 K \u00b1 \u03c0 \u2213 decays. The K * 0 invariant mass distribution is constructed by assigning the charged kaon mass to all muons in the inclusive muon sample and combining with another track (assigned the pion mass). The difference of distributions for events with K + \u2192 \u00b5 + and K \u2212 \u2192 \u00b5 \u2212 tracks is shown in Fig. 1, demonstrating the large excess of positive K \u2192 \u00b5 candidates. Simulations are used to correct for the fraction of kaons (\u2248 6%) that decay prior to being reconstructed [11]. The measurement is repeated in an independent sample of kaons from \u03c6 \u2192 K + K \u2212 decays, and the results are fully consistent.

            "text": "Finally, muon impact parameter (IP) information is being used to help identify the likely source of the observed asymmetry. For muons with small IP (less than 100\u00b5m, for instance), the probability that they arise from a B 0 d meson which has mixed is small, due to the low mixing frequency associated with the mass difference \u2206M d \u2248 0.5 ps \u22121 . In contrast, the contribution of muons from decays of B 0 s mesons which have mixed prior to decay is relatively stable with IP, due to the much higher mixing frequency associated with the mass difference \u2206M s \u2248 17 ps \u22121 . As such, by dividing the sample into two parts corresponding to small and large impact parameter muons, the resulting independent measurements of A b sl yield two bands in the a d sl -a s sl plane with different slopes. The overlapping region of these two slopes can then be directly compared to the SM predictions for both a d sl and a s sl . The anticipated timescale for publication is summer 2011.",
