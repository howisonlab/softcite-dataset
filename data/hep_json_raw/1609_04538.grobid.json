            "text": "The goal of the COMPASS experiment at CERN is to study the structure and dynamics of hadrons. The two-stage spectrometer used by the experiment has large acceptance and covers a wide kinematic range for charged as well as neutral particles and can therefore measure a wide range of reactions. The spectroscopy of light mesons is performed with negative (mostly \u03c0 \u2212 ) and positive (p, \u03c0 + ) hadron beams with a momentum of 190 GeV/c. The light-meson spectrum is measured in different final states produced in diffractive dissociation reactions with squared four-momentum transfer t to the target between 0.1 and 1.0 (GeV/c) 2 . The flagship channel is the \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + final state, for which COMPASS has recorded the currently world's largest data sample. These data not only allow to measure the properties of known resonances with high precision, but also to observe new states. Among these is a new axial-vector signal, the a 1 (1420), with unusual properties. Novel analysis techniques have been developed to extract also the amplitude of the \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + subsystem as a function of 3\u03c0 mass from the data. The findings are confirmed by the analysis of the \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 final state.",

In this process, the beam hadron is excited to some intermediate three-pion state X \u2212 via t-channel Reggeon exchange with the target. At 190 GeV/c beam momentum, Pomeron exchange is dominant. Diffractive reactions are known to exhibit a rich spectrum of intermediate states X \u2212 and are a good place to search for states beyond the naive constituent-quark model. In the past, several candidates for so-called spin-exotic mesons, which have J PC quantum numbers that are forbidden in the non-relativistic quark model, have been reported in pion-induced diffraction [2,3].",

The PWA of the (3\u03c0) \u2212 final states is based on the isobar model, which assumes that the X \u2212 decays first into an intermediate resonance, which is called the isobar, and a \"bachelor\" pion (\u03c0 \u2212 for the \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + final state; \u03c0 \u2212 or \u03c0 0 for \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 ). In a second step, the isobar decays into two pions. In accordance with the \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + invariant mass spectrum shown in Fig. 1 right and with analyses by previous experiments, we include [\u03c0\u03c0] S , \u03c1(770), f 0 (980), f 2 (1270), f 0 (1500), and \u03c1 3 (1690) as isobars into the fit model. Here, [\u03c0\u03c0] S represents the broad component of the \u03c0\u03c0 S -wave. Based on the six isobars, we have constructed a set of partial waves that consists of 88 waves in total, including one non-interfering isotropic wave representing three uncorrelated pions. This constitues the largest wave set ever used in an analysis of the 3\u03c0 final state. The partial-wave decomposition is performed in narrow bins of the 3\u03c0 invariant mass. Since the data show a complicated correlation of the m 3\u03c0 and t spectra, each m 3\u03c0 bin is further subdivided into non-equidistant bins in the four-momentum transfer t . For the \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + channel 11 bins are used, for the \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 final state 8 bins. With this additional binning in t , the dependence of the individual partial-wave amplitudes on the four-momentum transfer can be studied in detail. The details of the analysis model are described in Ref. [4].",

The amplitudes do contain information not only about the partial-wave intensities, but also about the relative phases of the partial waves. The latter are crucial for resonance extraction. The three-pion partial waves are defined by the quantum numbers of the X \u2212 (spin J, parity P, C-parity, absolute value M of the spin projection), the naturality \u03b5 = \u00b11 of the exchange particle, the isobar, and the orbital angular momentum L between the isobar and the bachelor pion. These quantities are summarized in the partial-wave notation J PC M \u03b5 [isobar] \u03c0 L.

The Breit-Wigner model describes the peak in the 1 ++ 0 + f 0 (980) \u03c0 P wave well and yields a mass of m 0 = (1414 +15 \u221213 ) MeV/c 2 and a width of \u0393 0 = (153 +8 \u221223 ) MeV/c 2 for the a 1 (1420). Due to the high statistical precision of the data, the uncertainties are dominated by systematic effects. The a 1 (1420) signal is remarkable in many ways. It appears in a mass region that is well studied since decades. However, previous experiments were unable to see the peak, because it contributes only 0.25 % to the total intensity. The a 1 (1420) is very close in mass to the 1 ++ ground state, the a 1 (1260). But it has a much smaller width than the a 1 (1260).

However, we cannot exclude that the fit results are biased by the employed isobar parametrizations. This is true in particular for the isoscalar J PC = 0 ++ isobars. In the PWA model, a broad \u03c0\u03c0 S -wave component is used, the parametrization of which is extracted from \u03c0\u03c0 S -wave elastic-scattering data [17]. In addition, the f 0 (980), described by a Flatt\u00e9 form [18], and the f 0 (1500), parametrized by a relativistic Breit-Wigner amplitude, are included as isobars. In order to study possible bias due to these parametrizations and to ensure that the observed a 1 (1420) signal is truly related to the narrow f 0 (980), a novel analysis method inspired by Ref. [19] was developed [4]. In this so-called freed-isobar analysis, the three fixed parametrizations for the 0 ++ isobar amplitudes are replaced by a set of piecewise constant complex-valued functions that fully cover the allowed two-pion mass range. This way the whole 0 ++ isobar amplitude is extracted as a function of the 3\u03c0 mass. In contrast to the conventional isobar approach, which uses the same isobar parametrization in different partial waves, the freed-isobar method permits different isobar amplitudes for different intermediate states X \u2212 . A more detailed description of the analysis method can be found in Ref. [4].",

Thus, even for large data sets, the freed-isobar approach can only be applied to a subset of partial waves. We performed a freed-isobar PWA, where the fixed parametrizations of the broad \u03c0\u03c0 S -wave component, of the f 0 (980), and of the f 0 (1500) were replaced by piece-wise constant isobar amplitudes for the 3\u03c0 partial waves 0 \u2212+ 0 + [\u03c0\u03c0] 0 ++ \u03c0 S , 1 ++ 0 + [\u03c0\u03c0] 0 ++ \u03c0 P, and 2 \u2212+ 0 + [\u03c0\u03c0] 0 ++ \u03c0 D. Figure 4 left shows the two-dimensional intensity distribution of the 1 ++ 0 + [\u03c0\u03c0] 0 ++ \u03c0 P wave as a function of m \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + and m 3\u03c0 . The distribution exhibits a broad maximum around m 3\u03c0 = 1.2 GeV/c 2 and between 0.6 and 0.8 GeV/c 2 in m \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + , which shows a pronounced t dependence and therefore is probably mainly of non-resonant origin. A smaller peak is observed in the f 0 (980) region at m 3\u03c0 \u2248 1.4 GeV/c 2 . This peak is more obvious in Fig. 4 center, which shows the intensity distribution summed over the two-pion mass interval around the f 0 (980) as indicated by the pair of horizontal dashed lines in Fig. 4 left. The peak is similar in position and shape to the a 1 (1420) peak in the 1 ++ 0 + f 0 (980) \u03c0 P wave (cf. Fig. 2). The resonant nature of the f 0 (980) becomes apparent in Fig. 4 right, which shows the m \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + dependence of the extracted amplitude at the a 1 (1420) peak in form of an Argand diagram. The phase is measured with respect to the 1 ++ 0 + \u03c1(770) \u03c0 S wave. The f 0 (980) contribution shows up as a semicircle-like structure   (highlighted by the blue line) with a shifted origin. This demonstrates that the observed a 1 (1420) signal in the f 0 (980) \u03c0 decay mode is not an artifact of the 0 ++ isobar parametrizations used in the conventional PWA method. More results of the freed-isobar PWA are discussed in Ref. [4].",
