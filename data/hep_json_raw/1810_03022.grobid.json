The pp measurement is performed as a function of transverse momentum (p T ) of the B 0 s mesons in the range of 7 to 50 GeV/c and is compared to the predictions of perturbative QCD calculations. The B 0 s production yield in PbPb collisions is measured in two p T intervals, 7 to 15 and 15 to 50 GeV/c, and compared to the yield in pp collisions in the same kinematic region. The nuclear modification factor (R AA ) is found to be 1.5 \u00b1 0.6(stat) \u00b1 0.5(syst) for 7-15 GeV/c, and 0.87 \u00b1 0.30(stat) \u00b1 0.17(syst) for 15-50 GeV/c, respectively. Within current uncertainties, the B 0 s results are consistent with models of strangeness enhancement, and suppression by parton energy loss, as observed for the B + mesons.",

            "text": "Relativistic heavy ion collisions allow the study of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) at high energy density and temperature. Under such extreme conditions, a state consisting of deconfined quarks and gluons, the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) [1,2], is predicted by lattice QCD calculations [3]. The study of the phenomenon in which the outgoing partons interact strongly with the QGP and lose energy by means of elastic collisions and mediuminduced gluon radiation [4][5][6][7][8] can provide insights into the energy density and diffusion properties of the QGP. Heavy quarks are effective probes to study these properties of the medium. Charm and beauty quarks that are primarily produced in hard scatterings at the early stages of the collision are expected to carry the full evolution history of the QGP formation [8]. On the other hand it is expected [9] that, via the process gg \u2192 ss, an enhancement of strangeness in a thermally and chemically equilibrated QGP should occur if its temperature is above the strange quark mass. Measurements at the BNL RHIC of the production of strange baryons and mesons, using different collision systems and beam energies, provide systematic support for this expectation [10][11][12][13][14]. Because of the interplay between the predicted enhancement of strange quark production and the quenching mechanism of beauty quarks, the measurement of strange beauty particles is important for studying the mechanisms of beauty hadronization in heavy ion colli-E-mail address: cms -publication -committee -chair @cern .ch. sions. In the presence of a medium with increased strangeness content [15,16], the relative yield of B 0 s mesons with respect to nonstrange beauty mesons at transverse momentum (p T ) below \u223c15 GeV/c [8,17] can be enhanced in nucleus-nucleus collisions compared to proton-proton (pp) interactions. This can happen if recombination is a significant factor of beauty hadronization in the QGP [18][19][20]. The recombination processes, which are considered markers for the presence of a deconfined medium, were most recently tested in the open charm sector by the ALICE Collaboration [21] . In this letter, we report the first measurement of exclusive B 0 s meson decays ever performed in nucleusnucleus collisions and in pp collisions at 5.02 TeV. The pp measurement is performed as a function of p T and compared to the predictions of fixed-order plus next-to-leading order logarithmic (FONLL) perturbative QCD calculations [24][25][26]. The nuclear modification factor (R AA ) of B 0 s mesons, which is defined as the ratio of the yield in PbPb collisions with respect to that in pp collisions scaled by the corresponding number of binary nucleon-nucleon (NN) collisions, is shown. The comparison between the R AA of B 0 s mesons and that of B + mesons measured by CMS at the same energy [27] is also presented.   [28]. The pp measurement is performed as a function of the B 0 s p T in three intervals, 7-15, 15-20, and 20-50 GeV/c. The PbPb production yield and the R AA measurement are performed in two p T intervals, 7-15 and 15-50 GeV/c, inclusively for all events (i.e., 0-100% centrality, the degree of overlap of the two colliding nuclei). Throughout the letter, unless otherwise specified, the y and p T variables given are those of the B 0 s mesons. This analysis does not distinguish between the charge conjugates.",

Within the solenoid volume are a silicon tracker that measures charged particles in the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 2.5, a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter, and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter. For charged particles of 1 < p T < 10 GeV/c and |\u03b7| < 1.4, the track resolutions are typically 1.5% in p T and 25-90  \u03bcm in the transverse (longitudinal) impact parameter [29]. Muons are measured in the range |\u03b7| < 2.4, with detection planes made using three technologies: drift tubes, cathode strip chambers, and resistive-plate chambers. The muon reconstruction algorithm starts by finding tracks in the muon detectors, which are then fitted together with tracks reconstructed in the silicon tracker to form \"global muons\". Matching muons to tracks measured in the silicon tracker results in a relative p T resolution for muons with 20 < p T < 100 GeV/c of 1.3-2.0% in the barrel (|\u03b7| < 1.2) and better than 6% in the endcaps (1.6 < |\u03b7| < 2.4). For muons with higher p T up to 1 TeV/c, the p T resolution in the barrel is better than 10% [30]. The hadron forward (HF) calorimeter uses steel as an absorber and quartz fibers as the sensitive material. The two halves of the HF are located 11.2 m away from the interaction point, one on each end, providing together coverage in the range 3.0 < |\u03b7| < 5.2. In this analysis, the HF information is used for performing an offline event selection. A detailed description of the CMS experiment and coordinate system can be found in Ref. [31].",

For the offline analysis, events have to pass a set of selection criteria designed to reject events from background processes (beam-gas collisions and beam scraping events) as described in Ref. [38]. Events are required to have at least one reconstructed primary interaction vertex, formed by two or more tracks, with a distance from the center of the nominal interaction region of less than 15 cm along the beam axis. In PbPb collisions, the shapes of the clusters in the pixel detector have to be compatible with those expected from particles produced by a PbPb collision [39]. In order to select hadronic collisions, the PbPb events are also required to have at least three towers in each of the HF detectors with energy deposits of more than 3 GeV per tower. The combined efficiency for this event selection, including the remaining non-hadronic contamination, is (99 \u00b1 2)%. Values higher than 100% are possible, reflecting the potential presence of ultra-peripheral (i.e., non-hadronic) collisions in the selected event sample. The PbPb sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of approximately 351 \u03bcb \u22121 . This value is indicative only, as the PbPb yield is normalized by the total number of minimum bias events sampled, N MB [38]. The pp data set corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 28.0 pb \u22121 , which is known to an accuracy of \u00b12.3% from the uncertainty in the calibration based on a van der Meer scan [40]. The average number of additional collisions per bunch crossing is approximately 0.9 for pp and less than 0.01 for PbPb data. The presence of multiple collisions is found to have a negligible effect on the measurement.",

The muons are also required to match the muons that triggered the event online, and to pass selection criteria optimized for low p T (the so-called soft selection [30]). Two muons of opposite sign (OS), with an invariant mass within \u00b1150 MeV/c 2 of the world-average J/\u03c8 meson mass [28] are selected to reconstruct a J/\u03c8 candidate, with a mass resolution of typically 18-55 MeV/c 2 , depending on the dimuon rapidity and p T . The OS muon pairs are fitted with a common vertex constraint and are kept if the p-value of the \u03c7 2 of the fit is greater than 1%, thus lowering the background from charm and beauty hadron semileptonic decays. Similarly, the \u03c6 meson candidates are formed with a common vertex constraint between two OS charged-particle tracks with p T > 300(150) MeV/c for PbPb (p p) sample, both required to pass standard selections [38]. The invariant mass, with a resolution of \u223c3.9 (3.4) MeV/c 2 for PbPb (p p) data, is required to be within 15 MeV/c 2 of the world-average \u03c6 meson mass [28]. The B 0 s meson candidates are constructed by combining the J/\u03c8 and \u03c6 candidates and requiring that they originate from a common vertex. Without using particle identification, assumptions need to be made about the masses of the charged particles. The difference between the natural width (according to PDG [41]) and the measured width (reflecting detector resolution) of the peaks is much bigger for the J/\u03c8 meson than for the \u03c6 meson. Therefore, in calculating the mass of the B 0 s candidates, the two charged particles are always assumed to have the mass of charged kaons, and the muon pair is assumed to have the mass of a J/\u03c8 meson.",

The estimation of the statistical uncertainties of the fitted raw yields is based on the second derivatives of the negative log-likelihood function. Examples of fits to the invariant mass distributions in pp and PbPb collisions are shown in Figs. 1 and 2 for the p T regions 7-15 and 15-50 GeV/c, respectively. The signal shape is modeled by two Gaussian functions with a common mean (which is a free parameter together with the amplitude), and different widths individually determined from MC simulations for the pp and PbPb results. The relative contribution of the two Gaussian functions to the signal yield is also fixed at the value given by the MC sample. The background is dominated by random combinations of prompt and nonprompt J/\u03c8 candidates with extra particles and it is modeled by a first-order polynomial, as determined by studies of the inclusive J/\u03c8 MC sample. Peaking structures that could arise from the background contamination of other B meson decays (e.g., B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8 K * 0 ) were found to be negligible as a consequence of the tight selection on the mass of the \u03c6 candidate.",

The uncertainty in the modeling of the background shapes is also evaluated by varying the probability distribution functions used to describe the background to a higher-order polynomial and exponential function. The maximum of the signal variations and the maximum of all the background variations are propagated as systematic uncertainties. For the p p results, the systematic uncertainty due to the selection of the B 0 s meson candidates is estimated by comparing the BDT-obtained nominal result with the results using a cut-based method (a rectangular cut) that uses the Genetic Algorithm to determine the best cut value for each parameter [42]. The same signal and background shape parametrization are used, and the same analysis parameters are optimized as in the BDT nominal method. The significance is similar for the two methods (\u223c8) for the p p bins. This provides an estimate of the potential difference between different selection criteria. The full difference between the two methods is propagated as a systematic uncertainty. For the PbPb results, because of the small signal in data, in order to minimize the impact of statistical fluctuations, a different approach was taken. In this case, the B 0 s selection uncertainty was estimated using the pp data sample, as the full difference in the yield between the p p results with the BDT trained on the p p sample (the nominal result) and the results with the BDT trained on the PbPb sample (the selection used for the PbPb results).",

Each toy is fit with a polynomial, which is then used to reweight the MC B 0 s meson p T spectra. A new acceptance value is calculated for each modified shape, for each kinematic bin. The root mean square (RMS) of all acceptances determined via toys is propagated as the systematic uncertainty by choosing the maximum RMS value emerging from the p T and y shape variations.

There is also an uncertainty assigned to account for potential bias in the efficiency calculations from the FONLL simulations of the B 0 s meson p T shape.

In the bottom panel of Fig. 4, the R AA of B + mesons from a previous measurement [27] is also shown. Compared to the B + mesons, there is an indication of an enhancement for B 0 s mesons, which would be the expectation in the presence of a contribution from beauty recombination with strange quarks in heavy ion collisions. However, the B 0 s R AA values are compatible with unity and their large uncertainties do not exclude a significant suppression. The p T dependence of R AA is compared to the B 0 s prediction of a perturbative QCD based model that includes both collisional and radiative energy loss, (CUJET3.0) [45][46][47], and a transport model based on a Langevin equation that includes collisional energy loss and heavy quark diffusion in the medium, (TAMU) [17,48]. The difference between the two models below p T \u223c 15 GeV reflects the contribution from recombination processes, which are included in the TAMU but not in the CUJET3.0 model. The results measured for p T > 7 GeV/c have the power to disentangle the two models, albeit after an increase in precision, which can be achieved with a bigger data sample.",

The B + R AA with a wider p T binning (15-50 GeV/c) is obtained by a B + yield weighted average of the results from three p T bins (15-20, 20-30 and 30-50 GeV/c) presented in previous work [27].
