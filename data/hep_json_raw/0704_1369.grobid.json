            "text": "The so-called \"proton spin crisis,\" initiated by the results from the polarized deep inelastic scattering experiments, has triggered wide effort towards the understanding of proton spin. Despite the wide efforts, there has remained large uncertainty on \u2206g, the gluon spin contribution to the proton. RHIC, the world's first polarized protonproton collider, provides us an opportunity to directly probe gluons in the proton. Double helicity asymmetry (A LL ) of inclusive \u03c0 0 production in polarized pp collisions is sensitive to \u2206g because \u03c0 0 production is dominated by gluon-gluon and quark-gluon interactions in the measured p T range. PHENIX has previously reported \u03c0 0 A LL in pp collisions at \u221a s = 200 GeV [1] which is based on the data taken in 2005 (Run5) and it indicates that \u2206g is not large. [2] But a large uncertainty remains for large Bjorken x (> 0.1) and more statistics are needed. During the run in 2006 (Run6), one-week data taking was performed at \u221a s = 62.4 GeV. Spin rotator commissioning was successful and we had longitudinally polarized collisions. [3] Even in this short data taking with a small integrated luminosity of 60 nb \u22121 and the average polarization of 48%, the data has a big advantage to cover the larger x region thanks to the lower center of mass energy. According to a pertubative QCD (pQCD) calculation, collisions at \u221a s = 62.4 GeV has \u223c 300 times larger cross-section than that at \u221a s = 200 GeV at fixed x T = 2p T / \u221a s. It corresponds to 10 times larger statistics than the previously reported \u03c0 0 A LL which is based on the integrated luminosity of 1.8 pb \u22121 with average polarization of 47%.",

The lower mass peak corresponds to background from hadrons and cosmic particles, which induce EMCal clusters with more complicated structure, each of them are then splitted on several ones. This peak roughly corresponds to two EMCal cell separation between two clusters, which moves to higher mass with increasing cluster pair p T . Since we used EMCal based trigger without coincidence with collision trigger at \u221a s = 62.4 GeV, the cosmic background is prominent unlike in data at \u221a s = 200 GeV. The contribution of such background under \u03c0 0 peak is negligible in the measured p T range. Since it does affect the lower side band, the A \u03c0 0 +BG LL estimation was done based only on the higher side band. The subtraction is done by using the following formula.",

Thus online values are used and systematic uncertainty of 20% is assigned for a single beam polarization measurement. It introduces scaling uncertainty of 40% on A LL .
