We set 95% confidence level upper limits on the production cross section times branching fraction. For the first time, we set limits for arbitrary combinations of left-and right-handed couplings of the W \u2032 boson to fermions. For couplings with the same strength as the standard model W boson, we set the following limits for M (W \u2032 ) > m(\u03bdR): M (W \u2032 ) > 863 GeV for purely left-handed couplings, M (W \u2032 ) > 885 GeV for purely right-handed couplings, and M (W \u2032 ) > 916 GeV if both left-and right-handed couplings are present. The limit for right-handed couplings improves for M (W \u2032 ) < m(\u03bdR) to M (W \u2032 ) > 890 GeV.",

Left-right symmetric models [2] add an additional group SU (2) R to the SM. Thus there are two bosons, W L and W R , associated with the SM SU (2) L group and the additional SU (2) R group that would mix to form the physical states. One of these physical states is identified with the W boson. Since the W boson is known experimentally to couple only to left-handed fermions, the other state, W \u2032 , would have to almost exclusively couple to right-handed fermions. If there exists a light righthanded neutrino \u03bd R , the decay W \u2032 \u2192 \u2113\u03bd R (where \u2113 is a charged lepton) is allowed. Otherwise, the W \u2032 can only decay to quarks, making it harder to observe.

The CDF Collaboration has published similar limits [9], neglecting the interference with SM single top quark production. Relative to our earlier publication, we use more than twice the integrated luminosity and improve the overall sensitivity of the analysis to a W \u2032 boson signal by using boosted decision trees (BDT). In Ref. [7] it was demonstrated that a single top quark signal at the level of a few percent was clearly identifiable by the BDT technique. For the first time, we perform a general analysis of the left-and right-handed gauge couplings a L ij , a R ij of the W \u2032 boson, 0 < a L,R ij < 1. For comparison with the earlier work, we also quote results for three special cases: (1) purely left-handed couplings, a L ij = a, a R ij = 0 \u2200i, j; (2) purely right-handed couplings, a L ij = 0, a R ij = a \u2200i, j; and (3) an equal mixture of left-and right-handed couplings, a L ij = a R ij = a \u2200i, j. Finally, we set limits on the mass of such W \u2032 bosons under the assumption of a \"SM-like\" coupling strength, i.e., a = 1.",

We set the top quark mass to 172.5 GeV; the factorization scale is set to M (W \u2032 ) and we use the CTEQ6M parton distribution functions [14]. The singletop generator reproduces the next-to-leading-order (NLO) kinematic distributions, and the interference term between the W \u2032 boson signal and the SM W boson. The width of the W \u2032 boson varies between 20 and 30 GeV for W \u2032 masses between 600 and 900 GeV [3,5]. It is 25% smaller without a light righthanded neutrino. The width does not have a significant effect on our search because it is smaller than the detector resolution. Therefore, the only relevant effect of a massive neutrino is the larger branching fraction for W \u2032 \u2192 tb. Unless mentioned otherwise we will assume in the following that there is a right-handed neutrino with M (W \u2032 ) > m(\u03bd R ). In this case the limits for right-handed couplings will be weaker than for M (W \u2032 ) < m(\u03bd R ) because of the smaller branching fraction for W \u2032 \u2192 tb. In the absence of interference between W and W \u2032 bosons and in the presence of a light right-handed neutrino, there is no difference between W \u2032 bosons with left-and right-handed couplings for our search.

The dominant background for our search originates from W +jets production. Smaller sources of backgrounds are from tt pair, t-channel single top quark (tqb), diboson, and Z+jets events. The diboson (W W , W Z, ZZ) backgrounds are modeled using pythia [15]. The other background processes are modeled using the alpgen [16] event generator and subsequently hadronized using pythia. The fraction of W +heavy flavor events (W bb, and W cc) is obtained by scaling the cross sections calculated by alpgen to the NLO cross section by a factor of 1.47. An additional correction factor of 0.95 \u00b1 0.13, derived from data samples with different number of b-tagged jets, is applied. The W c+light parton cross sections are scaled by a factor of 1.38.

            "text": "The sensitivity of the search is maximized by dividing the data into 24 independent channels based on lepton flavor (e, \u00b5), jet multiplicity (2,3,4), number of btagged jets (1,2), and two data collection periods, to take into account different signal acceptances and signalto-background ratios [7]. After applying all selections, we find the event yields for data and backgrounds as shown in Table I. The requirement \u221a\u015d > 400 GeV accepts most of the W \u2032 contribution but eliminates most of the W boson contribution. As the mass of the W \u2032 boson increases, its contribution to the tb final state decreases relative to that of the W boson, and therefore, the efficiency of this requirement decreases between 3.5% and 0.5% for W \u2032 boson masses between 600 and 1000 GeV. At this stage, the expected W \u2032 boson signal would constitute only a small fraction of the selected data sample. To improve discrimination, we calculate a multivariate discriminant based on BDTs that separates the W \u2032 boson signal from background and thus enhances the probability to observe W \u2032 boson production. We compute the discriminant independently in each of the 24 channels. The input variables used to train the BDT discriminants take into account the kinematic properties and angular correlations of the reconstructed objects and the topology of the event. A BDT is trained for each W \u2032 boson mass value using the Monte Carlo sample generated with a L = a R = 1. The final discriminant for all 24 channels combined is shown in Fig. 1(a). To represent the discriminant distribution expected from an arbitrary combination of couplings, we combine samples of W \u2032 decays generated with lefthanded, right-handed and mixed couplings and SM schannel tb production based on theoretical expectations from Ref [3]. Background events preferentially populate the low discriminant region whereas signal events are clustered towards high discriminant values. We observe good agreement between background prediction and data in all channels. The data show no deviation from background only expectations and we set 95% C.L. upper limits on the cross section for the process W \u2032 \u2192 tb \u2192 \u2113\u03bdbb using Bayesian statistics [19]. A Poisson distribution for the observed counts and a flat non-negative prior probability for the signal cross section are assumed. Systematic uncertainties are taken into account with Gaussian priors. The systematic uncertainties that affect the signal and background models are described in Ref. [20]. The largest sources of systematic uncertainties are the jet energy scale calibration and the modeling of b-tagging performance. Smaller uncertainties arise from the finite size of the MC samples, the corrections of the flavor composition of W +jets events, and from the normalization of the background. The total uncertainty in the background yield varies between 8% and 10% for the different channels. In determining the effect of the uncertainties from jet energy scale calibration, b-tag modeling, and W +jets modeling, we take into account changes in the shape of the discriminant distributions in addition to normalization effects.",

The predicted cross sections \u03c3 L , \u03c3 R , and \u03c3 LR as a function of W \u2032 boson mass are listed in Table II. We assume that the couplings to first generation quarks, a ud , which are important for the production of the W \u2032 boson, and the couplings to third generation quarks, a tb , which are important for the decay of the W \u2032 boson, are equal. For given values of a L and a R , the distributions are obtained by combining the four samples according to Eq. 2. We vary both a L and a R between 0 and 1 in steps of 0.1, for each W \u2032 boson mass value. We consider each of these 121 combinations of a L , a R , and M (W \u2032 ) as a model. For each of these models, the ratio of the s-channel and the W \u2032 cross sections is fixed. We then vary the total cross section to determine the expected and observed 95% C.L. upper limits. For the three special cases (a L , a R ) = (1, 0), (0, 1), and 1, 1, the measurements are listed along with the theoretical cross sections in Table II. For small W \u2032 masses, the cross section limits drop below the cross section for SM single top quark production in the schannel, because the data do not accommodate the large W \u2032 component that would have to be present for these models. The cross section limit reflects the maximum total cross section that the data can accommodate for the ratio of s-channel and W \u2032 production in the particular model. We can now assume values for any two of the three parameters, a L , a R , and M (W \u2032 ), and interpolate the cross section limit in the third parameter value. The value of the third parameter at which the cross section limit equals the theory cross section [3] represents the limit on the third parameter. Figure 1(b) shows contours of lower limits for the W \u2032 boson mass in the (a L , a R ) plane, and Fig. 1(c) shows contours of upper limits for the coupling a L in the (a R , M (W \u2032 )) plane for M (W \u2032 ) > m(\u03bd R ). Fig. 2 shows the cross section limits for the three special cases. As the W \u2032 boson mass increases, the selection efficiency decreases and the upper limits on the cross section increase.",

We do not observe any deviations from SM expectations and set upper limits on the cross section for the production of W \u2032 bosons. We compare upper limits to theory cross sections to extract the following limits for M (W \u2032 ) > m(\u03bd R ): M (W \u2032 ) > 863 GeV for purely left-handed couplings, M (W \u2032 ) > 885 GeV for purely right-handed couplings, and M (W \u2032 ) > 916 GeV if both left-and righthanded couplings are present. The limit for right-handed couplings improves for M (W \u2032 ) < m(\u03bd R ) to M (W \u2032 ) > 890 GeV. These mass limits improve previously published results by more than 100 GeV.   ",
