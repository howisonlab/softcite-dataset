Limits are set on the production of both massless and massive X 0 bosons. The large angular acceptance of this experiment allows limits to be placed on anisotropic \u00b5 + \u2192 e + X 0 decays, which can arise from interactions violating both lepton flavor and parity conservation. Branching ratio limits of order 10 \u22125 are obtained for bosons with masses of 13 -80 MeV/c 2 and with different decay asymmetries. For bosons with masses less than 13 MeV/c 2 the asymmetry dependence is much stronger and the 90% limit on the branching ratio varies up to 5.8 \u00d7 10 \u22125 . This is the first study that explicitly evaluates the limits for anisotropic two body muon decays.",

The data, consisting of 1.1\u00d710 10 stopped muon events, is appropriate for a search for the inclusive two body decay. The experiment used highly polarized muons delivered by the TRIUMF M13 beam line into a parallel plane spectrometer immersed in a uniform 2 Tesla magnetic field. The spectrometer consisted of 44 drift chambers (DCs) and 12 proportional chambers (PCs) arranged symmetrically about a high purity metal stopping foil. The stopping targets (75 \u00b5m Al or 30 \u00b5m Ag) also served as the central PC cathode. The design and construction of this detector has been described in detail elsewhere [18]. The spectrometer was oriented so that it had an approximate cylindrical symmetry centered on the muon beam-line axis, which is then defined as the z-axis of the detector coordinate system. It was constructed so that the position of the detector elements, specifically the position of sense wires, is known with a total precision of parts in 10 5 . The magnetic field was mapped to a similar precision. These factors determine the absolute momentum scale for particle trajectories measured in the detector. Figure 1 shows our measured distribution of positrons from muon decay binned by their total momentum p tot = | p| and cos \u03b8 = p z /p tot . The planar geometry of the spectrometer allows for a large angular acceptance of positrons resulting from decay in the target foil, with a relatively simple momentum calibration. The momentum resolution varies with p tot and \u03b8; at 52.8 MeV/c the momentum resolution is (58 keV/c)/| sin \u03b8| [11].",

A signal search was conducted on the altered spectrum. The resulting uncertainties in B were added to the other uncertainties in quadrature to produce the total uncertainties at each trial momentum. The resolution uncertainties obtained at momenta less than 52 MeV/c are consistent with statistical noise as expected. The contribution for massless decays is given in Table I.",

These intervals were defined using the Feldman-Cousins (FC) approach [23] and include both statistical and systematic uncertainties. As expected from the number of m X grid points on which the search is conducted, some of these lower limits are non-zero. The significance (p-value) of these B values is assessed by calculating the probability that a peak with the same or greater B/\u03c3 will occur at any of the m X grid points due to a random fluctuation. This was obtained by running the two body decay search on 1000 sets of randomized spectra and collecting the most significant signal from each search. The randomized spectra were generated by applying Poisson noise to the data and simulation. The signal amplitudes measured from the randomized spectra less the observed signal amplitude produces a probability distribution function (PDF) consistent with the null hypothesis. The resulting PDF has an appearance similar to a normal distribution and is used to define the p-value. Using the derived PDF is consistent with a simpler approach to obtaining these p-values assuming normally distributed uncertainties. These p-values, together with the average limits obtained, are reported in Table II. The isotropic results can be compared directly to those of Balke et al. [24] and Bryman and Clifford [25].",

Since the momentum resolution was also better than that of the TWIST detector by a factor of 2 at similar angles, the upper limit on the branching ratio is an order of magnitude smaller than the comparable limits set by this work.
