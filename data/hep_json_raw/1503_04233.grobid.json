The search is based on 20.3 fb \u22121 of proton-proton collision data at a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV recorded with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. The H AE boson is assumed to be produced via vector-boson fusion and the decays W AE \u2192 qq 0 and Z \u2192 e \u00fe e \u2212 =\u03bc \u00fe \u03bc \u2212 are considered. The search is performed in a range of charged Higgs boson masses from 200 to 1000 GeV. No evidence for the production of an H AE boson is observed. Upper limits of 31-1020 fb at 95% C.L. are placed on the cross section for vector-boson fusion production of an H AE boson times its branching fraction to W AE Z. The limits are compared with predictions from the Georgi-Machacek Higgs triplet model.",

In this case, it is produced via vector-boson fusion (VBF), W AE Z \u2192 H AE , at the LHC and decays to W AE Z. The search is performed in the channel with subsequent decays of W AE \u2192 qq 0 and Z \u2192 l \u00fe l \u2212 , over the H AE mass range 200 < m H AE < 1000 GeV.

The integrated luminosity of the data sample, considering only data-taking periods where all relevant detector subsystems were operational, is 20.3 AE 0.6 fb \u22121 [20]. The data were collected using a combination of single-electron, single-muon, electron-electron, and muon-muon triggers.

The branching fraction of H AE \u2192 W AE Z is expected to be very high above the W AE Z threshold, so for simplicity it is set to 1. For this comparison, a nonzero intrinsic H AE width must be taken into account. This is done by smearing the signal m lljj distributions with a relativistic Breit-Wigner distribution with a width as calculated in Ref. [45]. The fractional width \u0393 H AE =m H AE for s H \u00bc 1 increases from 0.2% at m H AE \u00bc 200 GeV to 31% at m H AE \u00bc 1000 GeV. Comparisons with the GMHTM are only shown for \u0393 H AE =m H AE < 0.15, since higher values may violate perturbative unitarity of the W AE Z \u2192 W AE Z scattering amplitudes. As shown in Fig. 3, the data exclude a charged Higgs boson over the range 240 < m H AE < 700 GeV for s H \u00bc 1, with weaker limits for smaller values of s H .",

This is the first search for this process. No deviation from the SM background prediction is observed. Upper limits at the 95% confidence level on the cross section of a VBF-produced H AE boson times its branching fraction to W AE Z are set between 31 and 1020 fb for a narrow W AE Z resonance. The data exclude a charged Higgs boson in the range 240 < m H AE < 700 GeV within the Georgi-Machacek Higgs triplet model with parameter s H \u00bc 1 and 100% branching fraction of H AE \u2192 W AE Z.",
