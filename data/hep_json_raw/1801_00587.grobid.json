The firstgeneration science programs include dark matter searches conducted by the CDEX and PandaX experiments. These activities are complemented by measurements of ambient radioactivity and installation of low-background counting systems. Phase II of the facility is being constructed, and its potential research projects are being formulated. In this review, we discuss the history, key features, results, and status of this facility and its experimental programs, as well as their future evolution and plans.",

This typically requires low-background experiments with large target mass and elaborate shielding to suppress ambient radioactivity due to photons and neutrons. Direct and induced effects due to cosmic rays, however, cannot be shielded. Accordingly, such experiments should be performed in laboratories located underground, where a kilometer-scale rock overburden can effectively attenuate the cosmic-ray fluxes and their induced background.",

Proton decays are generic predictions of Grand Unified Theories [2, pp.270-78] and attracted a great deal of interest in underground experiments and their techniques in the 1970s. This early phase was followed by a series of important results on neutrino oscillations and mixings [2, pp.235-58] produced by underground experiments, which provided the first glimpse of physics beyond the Standard Model. Ongoing and future generations of longbaseline neutrino beam experiments, which also involve massive underground detectors, will advance the study of the neutrino mixing matrix. Also under way are experimental studies of neutrinoless double-\u03b2 decay [2, pp.698-703], which aim to demonstrate that neutrinos are Majorana particles. Beyond neutrino physics, underground laboratories are also home to an array of experiments performing direct searches for dark matter [2, pp.353-60] in the context of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs, denoted by \u03c7) and axions.",

            "text": "The pilot CDEX-0 measurement was based on a 20-g prototype germanium detector at a 177-eV ee threshold with an exposure of 0.784 kg \u2022 day [25]. The CDEX-1 experiment adopted a pPCGe detector with a mass of 1 kg. The first results [without the NaI(Tl) AC detector] were based on an analysis threshold of 400 eV ee with an exposure of 14.6 kg \u2022 day [26,27]. Subsequent data taking incorporated the AC detector. After suppression of the anomalous surface background events and measurement of their signal efficiencies and background leakage factors with calibration data [28,29], all residual events were accounted for by known background models. The sensitivities were further improved with a longer exposure of 335.6 kg \u2022 day, and new constraints on spin-independent and spin-dependent \u03c7N couplings were derived [24]. The results (Figure 4) represent the most sensitive measurements made with the point-contact high-purity germanium (HPGe) detector. Figure 5a shows the dark matter constraints on \u03c7N spin-independent cross sections, along with other selected benchmark results [20,[30][31][32][33][34][35][36]. In particular, the allowed region from the CoGeNT experiment [20] was probed and excluded by the CDEX-1 results. The anomalous excess originated from the leakage of surface events into the bulk signal samples [28]. Figure 5b shows the constraints on \u03c7n spin-dependent cross sections, which also represent an improvement over published results in the light-WIMP region [30,37,38]. The superb energy resolution of germanium detectors allows spectral structures to be resolved even at low energies, where atomic-physics effects can be important. This benefits studies of axion-like particles [39] because these particles' experimental signatures are usually manifested as peaks or steps in their energy depositions at the target. An analysis was performed with the CDEX-1 data, and constraints on axion-electron couplings (g Ae ) for solar ( Figure 5c) and dark matter axions ( Figure 5d) were derived [40]. In particular, the data represent an improvement over earlier results [41,42] for dark matter axions with mass below 1 keV.",

The data taking concluded with the identification of a strong 85 Kr background. The analysis of this data set has been published [49]. No WIMP candidates were identified, and a 90% upper limit comparable to the 225-day limit from XENON100 [45] was set. PandaX-II resumed physics data taking in March 2016 after a krypton distillation campaign that reduced the krypton level by a factor of 10, leading to an average electron-recoil background of 2 \u00d7 10 \u22123 events/(kg \u2022 day)-the world's lowest reported level. The combined data from the commissioning run and an additional data-taking period from March to June 2016 provide a total exposure of 3.3 \u00d7 4 kg \u2022 day [54] and represent the largest WIMP search data set to date.",

Its ultimate goal is to reach the so-called neutrino floor at a sensitivity of \u223c 10 \u221249 cm 2 for the spin-independent \u03c7N cross section at a WIMP mass of \u223c 100 GeV/c 2 . The plan of the initial stage of PandaX-xT is to construct a detector with a sensitive target mass of 4 tons of liquid xenon. The TPC will be of a cylindrical shape roughly 1.2 m in diameter and height, almost a factor of two larger in every dimension in comparison to PandaX-II. For the photo-sensor coverage, it will use in total more than 350 3-inch PMTs at the top and bottom. The powerful self-shielding from liquid xenon will significantly suppress detector-material-related background. The level of 85 Kr background is also expected to reduce greatly by performing online distillation during the detector operation. The total background rate is projected to be 0.05\u00d710 \u22123 evts/kg/day, a factor of 40 lower than the best level achieved in PandaX-II. With a 2-year exposure, the sensitivity to the \u03c7N cross section is expected to reach 10 \u221247 cm 2 , more than one order of magnitude lower than the current PandaX-II limit. Increasing detector size does increase the technological complexity. For example, larger electrodes require new ways to keep their rigidity and flatness when the electric field is applied, while maintaining the thin-wire-plane to ensure high photon detection efficiency. As another example, more readout channels and longer readout windows are required, demanding a more sophisticated data acquisition system capable to handle the increasing data bandwidth. Therefore, the 4-ton experiment will also serve to demonstrate the critical technology necessary for the future-stage PandaX-xT detector.",
