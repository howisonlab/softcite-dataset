We use two models to characterize the \u03b7 \u2032 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 line shape around 1.85 GeV/c 2 : one which explicitly incorporates the opening of a decay threshold in the mass spectrum (Flatt\u00e9 formula), and another which is the coherent sum of two resonant amplitudes. Both fits show almost equally good agreement with data, and suggest the",

This observation was later confirmed by BESIII studies of the same process [2] with mass and width measured to be M = 1836.5\u00b13 +5.6 \u22122.1 MeV/c 2 and \u0393 = 190\u00b19 +38 \u221236 MeV/c 2 ; the X(1835) was also observed in the \u03b7K 0 S K 0 S channel in J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7K 0 S K 0 S decays, where its spin-parity was determined to be J P = 0 \u2212 by a partial wave analysis (PWA) [3]. An anomalously strong enhancement at the proton-antiproton (pp) mass threshold, dubbed X(pp), was first observed by BESII in J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3pp decays [4]; this observation was confirmed by BESIII [5] and CLEO [6]. This enhancement structure was subsequently determined to have spin-parity J P = 0 \u2212 by BESIII [7]. Among the various theoretical interpretations on the nature of the X(1835) and X(pp) [8][9][10][11][12], a particularly intriguing one suggests that the two structures originate from a pp bound state [13][14][15][16][17]. If the X(1835) is really a pp bound state, it should have a strong coupling to 0 \u2212 pp systems, in which case the line shape of X(1835) at the pp mass threshold would be affected by the opening of the X(1835) \u2192 pp decay mode. A study of the \u03b7 \u2032 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 line shape of X(1835) with high statistical precision therefore provides valuable information that helps clarify the nature of the X(1835) and X(pp).",

The acceptance of charged particles and photons is 93% of the 4\u03c0 solid angle.

For the J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03b7 \u2032 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 background, we use a one-dimensional data-driven method that first selects J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03b7 \u2032 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 from the data to determine the shape of their contribution to the selected \u03b7 \u2032 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 mass spectrum and re-weight this shape by the ratio of MC-determined efficiencies for J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7 \u2032 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03b7 \u2032 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 events; the total weight after re-weighting is the estimated number of J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03b7 \u2032 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 background events. Our studies of background processes show that neither the four peaks mentioned above nor the abrupt change in the line shape at 2m p are caused by background processes.",

We observed a significant distortion of the \u03b7 \u2032 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 line shape near the pp mass threshold that cannot be accommodated by an ordinary Breit-Wigner resonance function. Two typical models for such a line TABLE I. Fit results of using Flatt\u00e9 formula. The first errors are statistical errors, the second errors are systematic errors; the branching ratio is the product of B(J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3X) and B(X \u2192 \u03b7 \u2032 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ).  shape are used to fit the data. The first model assumes the state around 1.85 GeV/c 2 couples with pp and the distortion reflects the opening of the pp decay channel. The fit result for this model yields a strong coupling between the broad structure and the pp of g 2 pp /g 2 0 = 2.31 \u00b1 0.37 +0.83 \u22120.60 , with a statistical significance larger than 7\u03c3 for being non-zero. The pole nearest to the pp mass threshold of this state is located at M pole = 1909.5 \u00b1 15.9(stat.) +9. 4 \u221227.5 (syst.) MeV/c 2 and \u0393 pole = 273.5\u00b121.4(stat.) +6.1 \u221264.0 (syst.) MeV/c 2 . The second model assumes the distortion reflects interference between the X(1835) and another resonance with mass close to the pp mass threshold. A fit with this model uses a coherent sum of two interfering Breit-Wigner amplitudes to describe the \u03b7 \u2032 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 mass spectrum around 1.85 GeV/c 2 . This fit yields a narrow resonance below the pp mass threshold with M = 1870.2 \u00b1 2.2(stat.) +2.3 \u22120.7 (syst.) MeV/c 2 and \u0393 = 13.0\u00b16.1(stat.) +2.1 \u22123.8 (syst.) MeV/c 2 , with a statistical significance larger than 7\u03c3. With current data, both models fit the data well with fit qualities, and both suggest the existence of a state, either a broad state with strong couplings to pp, or a narrow state just below the pp mass threshold. For the broad state above the pp mass threshold, its strong couplings to pp suggests the existence of a pp molecule-like state. For the narrow state just below pp mass threshold, its very narrow width suggests that it be an unconventional meson, most likely a pp bound state. So both fits support the existence of a pp molecule-like or bound state. With current statistics, more sophisticated models such as a mixture of above two models cannot be ruled out. In order to elucidate further the nature of the states around 1.85 GeV/c 2 , more data are needed to further study J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7 \u2032 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 process. Also, line shapes for other decay modes should be studied near the pp mass threshold, including further studies of J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3pp and J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7K 0 S K 0 S .",
