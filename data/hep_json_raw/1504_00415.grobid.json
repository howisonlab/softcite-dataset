These correlations directly probe quark transversity distributions. We measure signals in excess of five standard deviations at high transverse momenta, at high pseudorapidities \u03b7 > 0.5, and for pair masses around the mass of the \u03c1-meson. This is the first direct transversity measurement in p+p collisions.",

            "text": "The non-perturbative structure of the nucleon can be described in terms of parton distribution functions (PDFs), equivalent to number densities of quarks and gluons in a fast moving nucleon. Transversity, h q 1 (x), is the least well known of the PDFs. It represents the transverse quark polarization in transversely polarized nucleons for quark flavor q and momentum fraction x. Due to its chiral odd nature, transversity vanishes for gluons in the nucleon (s z = 1 2 ) and is primarily a property of the valence quarks [1]. An experimental measurement of the nucleon tensor charge \u03b4q = 1 0 dx(h q 1 (x) \u2212 hq 1 (x)) will directly test our theory of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) when compared to calculations on the lattice or model calculations [2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11]. h 1 becomes acces-sible in physics observables when it is coupled with an additional chiral-odd partner, e.g., a transverse spindependent fragmentation process. This second part has to be measured independently in order to extract h 1 . Our current knowledge of h 1 [2,4] is based on fixedtarget semi-inclusive deep inelastic lepton-nucleon scattering (SIDIS) [12][13][14][15][16] in combination with data from electron-positron annihilation [17,18]. Proton-proton collisions allow us to reach into the dominant valence quark region, but the framework of perturbative QCD introduces complications when the intrinsic transverse momentum from the hadronization process has to be considered [19]. It has been shown that di-hadron correlations in the final state persist when integrated over intrinsic transverse momenta. This so-called Interference Fragmentation Function (IFF), H 1 , can therefore be described collinearly [20], the contributions to the cross section can be factorized [21] and the IFF should be universal among electron-positron annihilation, SIDIS, and proton-proton scattering.",

The stable beam polarization orientation is transverse to the collider plane and the polarization direction alternates between subsequent bunches or pairs thereof (polarization up \u2191 or down \u2193). The bunch polarization pattern is changed from fill to fill in order to reduce systematic effects. While typically both beams are polarized, a single-spin measurement is achieved by summing over the bunches in one beam, effectively reducing its polarization to near zero. This procedure essentially provides two statistically independent experiments at the same time. The polarization of each beam is measured by polarimeters using the elastic scattering of protons on very thin carbon targets, several times during a RHIC fill. The polarimeters are calibrated using a polarized hydrogen gas jet target [22]. We report results from the RHIC run in 2006 with an integrated luminosity of 1.8 pb \u22121 and an average beam polarization of about 60%.",

The data is binned in 16 equal bins covering 2\u03c0 in azimuth. The amplitude A U T of sin(\u03c6 RS ) is extracted by a fit to the data. The description of the functional form is very good, with a reduced \u03c7 2 per degree of freedom of 0.975 \u00b1 0.007 over all kinematic bins. We include all pion pairs with opposite charges from an event and define p h,1 to be the momentum of the positive particle (and p h,2 the negative particle accordingly). Note that this charge ordering is essential because it establishes the direction of R. A random charge assignment would lead to a vanishing asymmetry since it would randomize the sign of \u03c6 RS . Figure 2 shows the results for A U T as a function of the invariant mass M of the pion pair, both for forward (\u03b7 > 0)and backward (\u03b7 < 0) going particles. We define the forward direction here along the momentum of the polarized beam. The results combine independent measurements of the asymmetries for both polarized RHIC beams in the two halves of the STAR detector, which provides internal consistency checks.",

These are shown in the lower panel of Fig. 2. Simulated events have been embedded in detector response from unbiased real events and subsequently run through the whole analysis chain. Distributions of experimental properties have been matched reasonably well between simulation and measured data, which gives us confidence that the partonic variables are indeed describing the physics at hand. The mean x value, x , of the recorded data at midrapidity is around 0.2 and changes very little over the available invariant mass range. This value is well into the valence region, x > 0.1, where transversity is expected to be sizable. On the other hand, z rises more strongly with the invariant mass. This is essentially a consequence of the opening angle cut and the required minimum p T for each hadron. Naively one expects that the IFF is uniformly rising in z, since hadrons at high z carry more of the parent quark spin information. This is consistent with measurements in e + e \u2212 annihilation [18] where sizable values have been observed at similar z and M . In model calculations, the transverse spin dependence of the IFF originates from an interference of amplitudes with different angular momenta [29]. In our kinematic region, this will mainly be contributions from vector meson decays in a relative p-wave which interfere with nonresonant background in a relative s-wave. Therefore, it is expected that the invariant mass dependence will show an enhancement around the mass of the \u03c1 meson at 770 GeV/c 2 [29]. Our results confirm these expectations and show a clear signal in the forward direction around the \u03c1 mass.",

In particular the opening angle between the two pions directly affects the mean p T of the pair at fixed invariant masses. Wider opening angles preferentially select lower transverse momenta, so choosing a tighter cut will result in a higher p T especially at large M . This correlation is illustrated in the bottom of Fig. 5 (see also the supplemental data tables available online). The event simulations show that the larger transverse momenta also lead to an increased contribution from high-x partons and high-z fragmentation. It has previously been shown that H 1,q scales with z [18] and this is consistent with our observations in Fig. 5 at invariant masses above 0.7 MeV/c 2 . Although we find a systematic effect of the opening angle on the size of the asymmetries, we need to point out that the data still carry significant statistical uncertainties at the highest masses. The z-dependence may still be a minor contribution to the rise of the asymmetry in the available kinematic range. The leading systematic uncertainty for the presented data comes from the 4.8% scale uncertainty of the beam polarization. On average the purity of the single pion sample is 96% which has been determined in simulation studies. The purity shows a slight dependence on the transverse momentum, starting at around 94% and rising up to 97% at the highest p T . From model calculations, the asymmetry in \u03c0 \u2212 p correlations is expected to be very small. Data from \u03c0 \u2212 K asymmetries [31] are of the same sign as those of the two-pion system and of similar or smaller size. We do not assign a systematic uncertainty to the results due to the unknown size of the background asymmetry. In the worst case the dilution of the asymmetry is on the same order of magnitude as the impurity of the pion sample. Triggering on large electromagnetic energy deposits introduces a bias in the sampled event kinematics and partonic processes [32]. From simulations, we determine that our trigger bias in selecting the partonic subprocess leads to an enhancement of the fraction of quark-quark scattering sampled of up to 20% whereas quark-gluon and gluon-gluon scattering processes are suppressed by up to 10%. Overall, systematic uncertainties are very small compared to the statistical precision of the measurement, and they are not shown in the figures.",

The \u03c7 2 values of the individual fits are distributed according to a \u03c7 2 distribution (within the relevant statistics). An alternative way of computing the asymmetry takes advantage of the fact that the asymmetry is antisymmetric in \u03c6 RS and therefore a shift of \u03c0 and a flip of the beam polarization both lead to a sign change of the asymmetry [33]. The advantage of this \"proper-flip\" method is that the relative luminosity as well as detector efficiency dependencies cancel. The final results of A U T are in fact the same as those from eq.

Using the collinear factorization framework, the distribution of transversely polarized quarks described by the proton's transversity distribution function can be extracted from these results. This constitutes the first signal of transversity in p \u2191 + p collisions. The observed signal is enhanced for invariant masses of the hadron pair around the \u03c1 mass and rises with p T and \u03b7 consistent with qualitative expectations from the transversity distribution function and the dependence of the IFF on z and M . These results can be included in an extraction of transversity from world data in a collinear framework [34] that is currently underway [35]. Compared with previous measurements of two hadron corre-lations in SIDIS, the RHIC data allows access to a complementary kinematic regime. Proton-proton collisions do not suffer from u-quark dominance and will therefore help constrain the d-quark transversity. This global fit will enable for the first time a comparison of transverse single spin asymmetries with similar partonic kinematics measured in p \u2191 + p collisions to those from SIDIS and e + \u2212 e \u2212 annihilation.
