As yet unobserved heavy bosons, light bosons with extremely small couplings, or fermions can be present virtually in quantum loops, and thus affect the relative CP phase. Direct decays into non-flavourspecific final states can interfere with those that undergo B 0 s \u2212 B 0 s mixing prior to decay. This interference can result in CP violation. In certain B 0 s decays one CP -violating phase that can be measured, called \u03c6 s , can be expressed in terms of Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix elements as \u22122arg",

The detector includes a high-precision tracking system consisting of a silicon-strip vertex detector surrounding the pp interaction region [11], a large-area silicon-strip detector located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4 Tm, and three stations of silicon-strip detectors and straw drift tubes placed downstream of the magnet. The tracking system provides a measurement of the momentum, p, of charged particles with a relative uncertainty that varies from 0.5% at low momentum to 1.0% at 200 GeV. 2 The minimum distance of a track to a primary vertex (PV), the impact parameter (IP), is measured with a resolution of (15 + 29/p T ) \u03bcm, where p T is the component of the momentum transverse to the beam, in GeV. Different types of charged hadrons are distinguished using information from two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors [12]. Photons, electrons and hadrons are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic and a hadronic calorimeter. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers [13]. The online event selection is performed by a trigger, which consists of a hardware stage, based on information from the calorimeter and muon systems, followed by a software stage, which applies a full event reconstruction.",
