We measure the phase between the hadronic form factors to be \u2206\u03a6 = (42.4 \u00b1 0.6 \u00b1 0.5) \u2022 .

The spin orientations of the baryon and antibaryon are entangled and, for spin one-half baryons, the pair is produced either with the same or opposite helicities. The transition amplitudes to the respective spin states can acquire a relative phase due to the strong interaction in the final state, leading to a time-reversal-odd observable: a transverse spin polarization of the baryons [2,3]. This effect has previously been neglected for the baryon pairs from J/\u03c8 decays [4], and there is no prediction for this polarization.",

            "text": "The principle of the measurement is illustrated in Fig. 1. In the collision of an electron and positron, a J/\u03c8 resonance is produced at rest in a single photon annihilation process, and it subsequently decays into a \u039b\u039b pair: e + e \u2212 \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u039b\u039b. The transition between the initial electron-positron pair and the final baryon-antibaryon pair includes helicity conserving and -flip amplitudes [18][19][20][21][22]. Since the electron mass is negligible in comparison to the J/\u03c8 mass, the initial electron and positron helicities have to be opposite. This implies that the angular distribution and polarization of the produced \u039b and\u039b particles can be described uniquely by only two real parameters: \u03b1 \u03c8 -the J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u039b\u039b angular distribution parameter, and \u2206\u03a6 -the phase between the two helicity amplitudes. The value of the parameter \u03b1 \u03c8 is well known [23][24][25], but the phase \u2206\u03a6 has never been considered before. If \u2206\u03a6 = 0, the \u039b and\u039b will be polarized in the direction perpendicular to the production plane. The magnitude of the polarization depends on the angle (\u03b8 \u039b ) between the \u039b and the electron beam direction in the J/\u03c8 rest frame (see Fig. 1).",

The components of these vectors are expressed using a common (x,\u0177,\u1e91) coordinate system with the orientation shown in Fig. 1. The\u1e91 axis in the \u039b and \u039b rest frames is oriented along the \u039b momentum p \u039b in the J/\u03c8 rest system. The\u0177 axis is perpendicular to the reaction plane and oriented along the vector k \u2212 \u00d7 p \u039b , where k \u2212 is the electron beam momentum in the J/\u03c8 rest system. The variable \u03be denotes the tuple (\u03b8 \u039b ,n 1 ,n 2 ), a set of kinematic variables which uniquely specify an event configuration. The terms multiplied by \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b1 + in Eq. (1) represent the contribution from \u039b\u039b spin correlations, while the terms multiplied by \u03b1 \u2212 and \u03b1 + separately represent the contribution from the polarization. The presence of all three contributions in Eq. (1) enables an unambiguous determination of the parameters \u03b1 \u03c8 and \u2206\u03a6 and the decay asymmetries \u03b1 \u2212 , \u03b1 + .

N is the total number of events in the data sample and N (\u03b8 \u039b ) is the number of events in a cos \u03b8 \u039b bin. In the limit of CP conservation, \u03b1 \u2212 = \u2212\u03b1 + , while an approximate isospin symmetry leads to \u03b1 + \u2248\u1fb1 0 [16,30], and the expected angular depen- dence is \u00b5(cos \u03b8 \u039b ) \u223c 1 \u2212 \u03b1 2 \u03c8 \u03b1 \u2212 sin \u2206\u03a6 cos \u03b8 \u039b sin \u03b8 \u039b for the acceptance corrected data (compare Eq. (1)). The phase between helicity flip and helicity conserving transitions is determined to be \u2206\u03a6 = (42.4 \u00b1 0.6 \u00b1 0.5) \u2022 , where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second systematic. This large value of the phase enables a simultaneous determination of the decay asymmetry parameters for \u039b \u2192 p\u03c0 \u2212 ,\u039b \u2192p\u03c0 + , and\u039b \u2192n\u03c0 0 as given in Table I. The value of \u03b1 \u2212 = 0.750 \u00b1 0.009 \u00b1 0.004 differs by more than five standard deviations from the commonly accepted world average value of \u03b1 PDG \u2212 = 0.642 \u00b1 0.013, based on elaborate experiments from 1963-75 [13][14][15][16][17], where the daughter proton polarization was measured in a secondary scattering process. Our result means that all published measurements on \u039b/\u039b polarization, determined from the product of \u03b1 \u2212 and the polarization, are (17 \u00b1 3)% too large. The obtained value for the ratio\u1fb1 0 /\u03b1 + is 3\u03c3 lower than unity, the value expected from the |\u2206I| = 1 2 rule for non-leptonic decays of strange particles [16,31], indicating the importance of radiative corrections [30,32]. The \u03b1 \u2212 and \u03b1 + values determined in this Letter, together with the covariance matrix, enable a calculation of the CP odd observable A CP = (\u03b1 \u2212 + \u03b1 + )/(\u03b1 \u2212 \u2212 \u03b1 + ) = \u22120.006 \u00b1 0.012 \u00b1 0.007. This is the most sensitive test of CP violation for the \u039b baryon with a substantially improved precision over previous measurements [9]  (Table I) and using a novel, model independent method. The Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) mechanism predicts an A CP value of \u223c 10 \u22124 [33], while various extensions of the standard model predict larger value [34], in an attempt to explain the observed baryon-antibaryon asymmetry in the universe. This new method for CP tests, when applied to the foreseen future larger data samples, can reach a precision level compatible with theory predictions, which in turn will give a clue about baryogenesis.",
