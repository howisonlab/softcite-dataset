MoEDAL, deployed in the LHCb cavern, combines passive nuclear track detectors with magnetic monopole trapping volumes (MMTs), while spallation-product backgrounds are being monitored with an array of MediPix pixel detectors. An introduction to the detector concept and its physics reach, complementary to that of the large general purpose LHC experiments ATLAS and CMS, will be given. Emphasis is given to the recent MoEDAL results at 13 TeV, where the null results from a search for magnetic monopoles in MMTs exposed in 2015 LHC collisions set the world-best limits on particles with magnetic charges more than 1.5 Dirac charge. The potential to search for heavy, long-lived supersymmetric electrically-charged particles is also discussed.",

It is designed to search for manifestations of new physics through highly-ionising particles in a manner complementary to ATLAS and CMS [4]. The most important motivation for the MoEDAL experiment is to pursue the quest for magnetic monopoles and dyons at LHC energies. Nonetheless the experiment is also designed to search for any massive, stable or long-lived, slowmoving particles [5] with single or multiple electric charges arising in many scenarios of physics beyond the Standard Model (SM). A selection of the physics goals and their relevance to the MoEDAL experiment are described here and elsewhere [6]. For an extended and detailed account of the MoEDAL discovery potential, the reader is referred to the MoEDAL Physics Review [7]. Emphasis is given here on recent MoEDAL results, based on the exposure of magnetic monopole trapping volumes to 7-TeV and 8-TeV proton-proton collisions.",

The passage of a highlyionising particle through the plastic detector is marked by an invisible damage zone along the trajectory. The damage zone is revealed as a cone-shaped etch-pit when the plastic detector is etched using a hot sodium hydroxide solution. Then the sheets of plastics are scanned looking for aligned etch pits in multiple sheets. The MoEDAL NTDs have a threshold of Z/\u03b2 \u223c 5, where Z is the charge and \u03b2 = v/c the velocity of the incident particle. In proton-proton collision running, the only source of known particles that are highly ionising enough to leave a track in MoEDAL NTDs are spallation products with range that is typically much less than the thickness of one sheet of the NTD stack. In that case the ionising signature will be that of a very low-energy electrically-charged stopped particle. This signature is distinct to that of a penetrating electrically or magnetically charged particle that will usually traverse every sheet in a MoEDAL NTD stack, accurately demarcating a track that points back to the collision point with a resolution of \u223c 1 cm. The part of the Run-2 NTD deployment which rests on top of the LHCb VELO is visible in Fig. 2. This is the closest possible location to the interaction point and represents a novelty of this run with respect to earlier installations during Run-1.  ",

In Dirac's formulation, magnetic monopoles are assumed to exist as point-like particles and quantum mechanical consistency conditions lead to Eq. (1), establishing the value of their magnetic charge. Although monopoles symmetrise Maxwell's equations in form, there is a numerical asymmetry arising from the DQC, namely that the basic magnetic charge is much larger than the smallest electric charge. A magnetic monopole with a single Dirac charge (g D ) has an equivalent electric charge of \u03b2(137e/2). Thus for a relativistic monopole the energy loss is around 4,700 times (68.5 2 ) that of a minimum-ionising electrically-charged particle. The monopole mass remains a free parameter of the theory.",

Monopolium is a neutral state, hence it is difficult to detect directly at a collider detector, although its decay into two photons would give a rather clear signal for the ATLAS and CMS detectors [31,32], which however would not be visible in the MoEDAL detector. Nevertheless according to a novel proposal [33], the LHC radiation detector systems can be used to turn the LHC itself into a new physics search machine by detecting final-state protons pp \u2192 pXp exiting the LHC beam vacuum chamber at locations determined by their fractional momentum losses. Such technique would be appealing for detecting monopolia. Furthermore the monopolium might break up in the medium of MoEDAL into highly-ionising dyons, which subsequently can be detected in MoEDAL [7]. Moreover its decay via photon emission would produce a peculiar trajectory in the medium, should the decaying states are also magnetic multipoles [7].",

Fig. 7). The ATLAS bounds are better that the MoEDAL ones for |g| = 1g D due to the higher luminosity delivered in ATLAS and the loss of acceptance in MoEDAL for small magnetic charges. On the other hand, higher charges are difficult to be probed in ATLAS due to the limitations of the electromagneticcalorimeter-based level-1 trigger deployed for such searches. A comparison of the limits on monopole production cross sections set by other colliders with those set by MoEDAL is presented in Ref. [29], while general limits including searches in cosmic radiation are reviewed in Ref. [38].",

Electrically-charged long-lived particles in supersymmetry Supersymmetry (SUSY) is an extension of the Standard Model which assigns to each SM field a superpartner field with a spin differing by a half unit. SUSY provides elegant solutions to several open issues in the SM, such as the hierarchy problem, the identity of dark matter, and the grand unification. SUSY scenarios propose a number of massive slowly moving electrically charged particles. If they are sufficiently long-lived to travel a distance of at least O(1m) before decaying and their Z/\u03b2 0.5, then they will be detected in the MoEDAL NTDs. No highly-charged particles are expected in such a theory, but there are several scenarios in which supersymmetry may yield massive, long-lived particles that could have electric charges \u00b11, potentially detectable in MoEDAL if they are produced with low velocities (\u03b2 0.2) .

The simultaneous presence of terms of the first and third type in Eq. (2), namely \u03bb and \u03bb , is severely restricted by lower limits on the proton lifetime, but other combinations are less restricted. The trilinear couplings in Eq. (2) generate sparticle decays such asq \u2192qq or q , or\u02dc \u2192 , whereas the bilinear couplings in Eq. (2) generate Higgs-slepton mixing and thereby alsoq \u2192 q and\u02dc \u2192 decays [40]. For a nominal sparticle mass \u223c 1 TeV, the lifetime for such decays would exceed a few nanoseconds for \u03bb, \u03bb , \u03bb < 10 \u22128 . If R parity is broken, the LSP would be unstable, and might be charged and/or coloured. In the former case, it might be detectable directly at the LHC as a massive slowly-moving charged particle. In the latter case, the LSP would bind with light quarks and/or gluons to make colour-singlet states, the so-called R-hadrons, and any charged state could again be detectable as a massive slowly-moving charged particle. If \u03bb = 0, the prospective experimental signature would be similar to a stau next-to-lightest sparticle (NLSP) case to be discussed later. On the other hand, if \u03bb or \u03bb = 0, the prospective experimental signature would be similar to a stop NLSP case, yielding the possibility of charge-changing interactions while passing through matter. This could yield a metastable charged particle, created whilst passing through the material surrounding the intersection point, that would be detected by MoEDAL. 5.1.2. Metastable lepton NLSP in the CMSSM with a neutralino LSP However, even if R parity is exact, the NLSP may be long lived. This would occur, for example, if the LSP is the gravitino, or if the mass difference between the NLSP and the neutralino LSP is small, offering more scenarios for long-lived charged sparticles. In neutralino dark matter scenarios based on the constrained MSSM (CMSSM), for instance, the most natural candidate for the NLSP is the lighter stau slepton\u03c4 1 [41], which could be long lived if m\u03c4 1 \u2212 m\u03c70 1 is small. There are several regions of the CMSSM parameter space that are compatible with the constraints imposed by unsuccessful searches for sparticles at the LHC, as well as the discovered Higgs boson mass. These include a strip in the focus-point region where the relic density of the LSP is brought down into the range allowed by cosmology because of its relatively large Higgsino component, a region where the relic density is controlled by rapid annihilation through direct-channel heavy Higgs resonances, and a strip where the relic LSP density is reduced by coannihilations with near-degenerate staus and other sleptons. It was found in a global analysis that the two latter possibilities are favoured [42].",

Experimental considerations There are several considerations supporting the complementary aspects of MoEDAL w.r.t. ATLAS and CMS when discussing the observability of (meta-)stable massive electrically-charged particles. Most of them stem from MoEDAL being \"time-agnostic\" due to the passive nature of its detectors. Therefore signal from very slowly moving particles will not be lost due to arriving in several consecutive bunch crossings. ATLAS and CMS, on the other hand, perform triggered-based analyses relying either on triggering on accompanying \"objects\", e.g. missing transverse energy, or by developing and deploying specialised triggers. In both cases the efficiency may lower and in the former the probed parameter space may be reduced. MoEDAL is mainly limited by the geometrical acceptance of the detectors, especially the MMTs, and by the requirement of passing the Z/\u03b2 threshold of NTDs. In general ATLAS and CMS have demonstrated to cover high-velocities \u03b2 0.2, while MoEDAL is sensitive to lower ones \u03b2 0.2.",

The background in the latter case, coming from cosmic rays, should be easier to control and assess. The probed lifetimes should be larger due to the unlimited monitoring time.",

For example, doubly-charged scalar states, usually termed doubly-charged Higgs fields, appear in left-right symmetric models [50][51][52] and in see-saw models for neutrino masses with Higgs triplets. A number of models encompasses additional symmetries and extend the SM Higgs sector by introducing doubly-charged Higgs bosons. A representative example of such a model is the L-R Symmetric Model (LRSM) [50][51][52], proposed to amend the fact that the weak-interaction couplings are strictly left handed by extending the gauge group of the SM so as to include a right-handed sector. The simplest realisation is an LRSM [50,51] that postulates a right-handed version of the weak interaction, whose gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken at high mass scale, leading to the parity-violating SM. This model naturally accommodates recent data on neutrino oscillations and the existence of small neutrino masses. The model generally requires Higgs triplets containing doubly-charged Higgs bosons (H \u00b1\u00b1 ) \u2206 ++ R and \u2206 ++ L , which could be light in the minimal supersymmetric left-right model [53].",

The distribution of the remnant charges obtained is shown in Fig. 10. The black hole remnants considered here are heavy, with masses of a TeV or more.

In some cases the bulk is \"punctured\" by lowerdimensional D-brane defects, which are either point-like or have their longitudinal dimensions compactified [68]. From a low-energy observer's perspective, such structures would effectively appear to be point-like D-particles. The latter have dynamical degrees of freedom, thus they can be treated as quantum excitations above the vacuum [68,69] collectively referred to as D-matter. D-matter states are non-perturbative stringy objects with masses of order m D \u223c M s /g s , where g s is the string coupling, typically of order one so that the observed gauge and gravitational couplings is reproduced. Hence, the D-matter states could be light enough to be phenomenologically relevant at the LHC.",

Therefore the LDPs are possible candidates for cold dark matter [69]. D-particles are solitonic non-perturbative objects in the string/brane theory. As discussed in the relevant literature [69], there are similarities and differences between D-particles and magnetic monopoles with non-trivial cosmological implications [68,[70][71][72]. An important difference is that they could have perturbative couplings, with no magnetic charge in general. Nonetheless, in the context of brane-inspired gauge theories, brane states with magnetic charges can be constructed, which would manifest themselves in MoEDAL in a manner similar to magnetic monopoles.",

Depending on the details of the microscopic model considered, and the way the SM is embedded, such massive charged states can be relatively long-lived, and could likewise be detectable with MoEDAL.

Such particles can be light enough to be producible at the LHC energies (see e.g. Q-balls in the context of some SUSY or brane models [73]). In this paper we have described searches for only a subset of those particles, due to lack of space.

The favoured regions of the muon anomalous magnetic moment at 1\u03c3, 2\u03c3 and 2.5\u03c3 confidence level are indicated by solid lines. From Ref.[44].",
