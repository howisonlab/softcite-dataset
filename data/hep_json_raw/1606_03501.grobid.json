This motivates the possibility of new hidden sectors that are only feebly coupled to the SM; by analogy with the SM, such sectors may contain their own interactions with new gauge bosons (Z ). In the simplest case of a hidden U(1) interaction, SM fields may directly couple to the Z , or alternatively the Z boson may mix with the SM hypercharge boson, which typically results from an off-diagonal kinetic term [1]. In the latter case, the Z inherits couplings proportional to the SM gauge couplings; due to large couplings to electrons and light-flavor quarks, such scenarios are strongly constrained by existing searches [2][3][4][5][6][7][8].",

While such a scenario can be additionally constrained by neutrino-nucleus scattering at neutrino beam experiments, the measurement presented here is also sensitive to models where couplings to neutrinos are absent, such as a gauge boson coupled exclusively to righthanded muons [15]. This search is based on 514 fb \u22121 of data collected by the BABAR detector at the PEP-II e + e \u2212 storage ring, mostly taken at the \u03a5 (4S) resonance, but also at the \u03a5 (3S) and \u03a5 (2S) peaks, as well as in the vicinity of these resonances [16]. The BABAR detector is described in detail elsewhere [17,18]. Dark boson masses between the dimuon threshold and 10 GeV are probed [19]. To avoid experimental bias, the data are * Now at: Wuhan University, Wuhan 43072, China  [21] for Z mass hypotheses ranging from the dimuon mass threshold to 10.3 GeV. The background arises mainly from QED processes. The e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 reaction is generated with Diag36 [22], which includes the full set of lowest order diagrams, while the e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 (\u03b3) and e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 (\u03b3) processes are simulated with KK [23]. Other sources of background include e + e \u2212 \u2192 qq (q = u, d, s, c) continuum production, simulated with JETSET [24], and e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8 events, generated using EvtGen [25] with a phase-space model.

A peak corresponding to the \u03c1 meson is visible at low mass; the second Z candidate reconstructed in these events generates the enhancement near 9.5 GeV. Other than the J/\u03c8 , no significant signal of other narrow resonances is observed. The signal efficiency rises from \u223c 35% at low masses to \u223c 50% around m R = 6 \u2212 7 GeV, before dropping again at higher masses. The signal efficiencies include a correction factor of 0.82, which primarily accounts for the impact of ISR not included in the simulation, as well as differences between data and simulation in trigger efficiency, charged particle identification, and track and photon reconstruction efficiencies. This correction factor is derived from the ratio of the m R distribution in simulated e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 events to the observed distribution in the mass region 1-9 GeV, excluding the J/\u03c8 region (light blue line in Fig. 2). An uncertainty of 5% is propagated as a systematic uncertainty, covering the small variations between data-taking periods and the uncertainties on the e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 cross-section.",

The search is conducted in varying mass steps that correspond to the dark boson mass resolution. Each fit is performed over an interval 50 times broader than the signal resolution at that mass for m R > 0.2 GeV, or over a fixed interval 0 \u2212 0.3 GeV for m R < 0.2 GeV. We estimate the signal resolution by Gaussian fits to several simulated Z samples for the purpose of determining the scan steps, and interpolate the results to all other masses. The resolution varies between 1 \u2212 9 MeV, dominated by experimental effects. We probe a total of 2219 mass hypotheses. The bias in the fitted values, estimated from a large ensemble of pseudo-experiments, is negligible. The likelihood function, described below, contains components from signal, continuum background, and peaking background where appropriate. The signal probability density function (pdf) is modeled directly from the signal Monte Carlo mass distribution using a nonparametric kernel density function. The pdf is interpolated between the known simulated masses using an algorithm based on the cumulative density function [27]. An uncertainty of 0.1 \u2212 3.2 events associated to this procedure is estimated by taking the next-to-closest mass point in place of the closest simulated mass point to interpolate the signal shape. The agreement between the simulated signal resolution and the data is assessed by fitting the full-energy peak of the four-muon invariant mass spectrum in the range 10.3 \u2212 10.7 GeV with a Crystal Ball function [28]. The ratio of simulated and reconstructed peak widths is 1.01\u00b10.04, consistent with unity. The impact of ISR emission on the peak widths are expected to be small in that mass range. Similarly, the decay width of the J/\u03c8 resonance is well reproduced by the simulation within its uncertainty.",

The two methods give similar signal yields at the transition point. Peaking contributions from the J/\u03c8 resonance are modeled from the mass distribution extracted from the corresponding Monte Carlo, leaving the yield as a free parameter. We exclude the resonant region from the search, vetoing a range of \u00b130 MeV around the nominal J/\u03c8 mass. The contribution from \u03c1-meson decay is very wide and easily absorbed by the background fit in each narrow window. We estimate the uncertainty associated with the background model by repeating the fit using a third order polynomial in the high-mass region or a fourth-order polynomial constrained to pass through the origin in the low mass range. This uncertainty is as large as 35% of the statistical uncertainty in the vicinity of the dimuon threshold and high-mass boundary, but remains at a level of a few percent outside these regions.",

The uncertainties on the luminosity (0.6%) [16] and the limited Monte Carlo statistics (1-3%) are propagated as systematic uncertainties. The cross-sections are finally combined and displayed in Fig. 3. We consider all but the uncertainties on the luminosity and the efficiency corrections to be uncorrelated. The statistical significance of each fit is taken as S S = sign(N sig ) 2 log (L/L 0 ), where N sig is the fitted signal yield, and L (L 0 ) is the maximum likelihood values for a fit including (excluding) a signal. These significances are almost Gaussian, and the combined significance is derived under this assumption. A large sample of Monte Carlo experiments is generated to estimate trial factors. The largest local significance is 4.3\u03c3, observed near m Z = 0.82 GeV, corresponding to a global significance of 1.6\u03c3, consistent with the null hypothesis.",
