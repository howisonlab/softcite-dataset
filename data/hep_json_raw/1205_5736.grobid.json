The analysed data correspond to an integrated luminosity of about 2 fb \u22121 recorded in protonproton collisions at \u221a s = 7 TeV by the CMS experiment at the LHC. The search is sensitive to the decays of the top quark pairs tt \u2192 H \u00b1 W \u2213 bb and tt \u2192 H \u00b1 H \u2213 bb. Various final states have been studied separately, all requiring presence of a \u03c4 lepton from H + decays, missing transverse energy, and multiple jets. Upper limits on the branching fraction B(t \u2192 H + b) in the range of 2-4% are established for charged Higgs boson masses between 80 and 160 GeV, under the assumption that B(H + \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03bd \u03c4 ) = 1.",

            "text": "The minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model (MSSM) requires the introduction of two Higgs doublets in order that the superpotential can contain appropriate terms for giving masses to both up and down type quarks [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8]. This leads to the prediction of five elementary Higgs particles: two CP-even (h,H), one CP-odd (A), and two charged (H \u00b1 ) states [9,10]. The lower limit on the charged Higgs boson mass is 78.6 GeV, as determined by LEP experiments [11][12][13][14]. If the mass of the charged Higgs boson is smaller than the difference between the masses of the top and the bottom quarks, i.e. m H + < m t \u2212 m b , the top quark can decay via t \u2192 H + b (charge conjugate processes are always implied throughout this paper). For values of tan \u03b2 > 5, the charged Higgs boson preferentially decays to a \u03c4 lepton and a neutrino, H + \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03bd \u03c4 , where tan \u03b2 is defined as the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two Higgs boson doublets. In deriving the experimental limits we assume that the branching fraction B(H + \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03bd \u03c4 ) is equal to 1.",

The search for a charged Higgs boson is sensitive to JHEP07(2012)143 the decays of the top quark pairs tt \u2192 H \u00b1 W \u2213 bb and tt \u2192 H \u00b1 H \u2213 bb, where each charged Higgs boson decays into a \u03c4 lepton and a neutrino. Throughout this paper, these two decay modes are referred to as WH and HH, respectively. Three different final states are studied, all requiring missing transverse energy and multiple jets. The \u03c4 lepton decaying into hadrons and a neutrino is labeled \u03c4 h . The first final state involves the production of \u03c4 h and jets (labeled \u03c4 h +jets), the second one is where \u03c4 h is produced in association with an electron or a muon (labeled e\u03c4 h or \u00b5\u03c4 h ), and the third one is where an electron and a muon are produced (labeled e\u00b5). Figure 1 shows representative diagrams for the \u03c4 h +jets (left plot), e(\u00b5)\u03c4 h (middle plot), and e\u00b5 (right plot) final states. We use a data sample recorded by the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment until the end of August 2011 with an average number of interactions per crossing (pileup) of 5-6. The analyses correspond to an integrated luminosity ranging from 1.99 to 2.27 fb \u22121 depending on the final state.",
