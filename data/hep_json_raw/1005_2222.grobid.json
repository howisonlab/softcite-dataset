Stark, 14  We report the results of a search for pair production of scalar bottom quarks (b1) and scalar third-generation leptoquarks (LQ3) in 5.2 fb \u22121 of pp collisions at the D0 experiment of the Fermilab Tevatron Collider. Scalar bottom quarks are assumed to decay to a neutralino (\u03c7 0 1 ) and a b quark, and we set 95% C.L. lower limits on their production in the (mb 1 , m\u03c70 1 ) mass plane such as mb 1 > 247 GeV for m\u03c70 1 = 0 and m\u03c70 1 > 110 GeV for 160 < mb 1 < 200 GeV. The leptoquarks are assumed to decay to a tau neutrino and a b quark, and we set a 95% C.L. lower limit of 247 GeV on the mass of a charge-1/3 third-generation scalar leptoquark.",

The theory permits a mass difference between the squark mass eigenstates,q 1 andq 2 , and allows the possibility that the lighter states of top and bottom squarks have masses smaller than the squarks of the first two generations.

The momenta of charged particles and the location of the interaction vertices are determined using a silicon microstrip tracker and a central fiber tracker immersed in the magnetic field of a 2 T solenoid. Jets, electrons, and tau leptons are reconstructed using the tracking information and the pattern of energy deposits in three uranium/liquid-argon calorimeters located outside the tracking system with a central calorimeter covering pseudorapidity |\u03b7| < 1.1, and two end calorimeters housed in separate cryostats covering the regions up to |\u03b7| \u2248 4.2. Jet reconstruction uses a cone algorithm [10] with radius R = (\u2206y) 2 + (\u2206\u03c6) 2 = 0.5 in rapidity (y) and azimuth (\u03c6). Muons are identified through the association of tracks with hits in the muon system, which is outside of the calorimeter and consists of drift tubes and scintillation counters before and after 1.8 T iron toroids. The / E T is determined from the negative of the vector sum of the transverse components of the energy deposited in the calorimeter and the transverse momenta p T of detected muons. The jet energies are calibrated using transverse energy balance in events with photons and jets and this calibration is propagated to the value of / E T . The data were recorded using triggers based on jets and the / E T in the event. In addition to requirements on / E T and jet energy, the vector sum of the transverse energies of all jets, defined as / H T \u2261 | jets p T |, the scalar sum of the p T of the jets (H T ), and the angle \u03b1 between the two leading jets in the transverse plane, are also used for triggering. Typical requirements are / E T > 25 GeV, / H T > 25 GeV, H T > 50 GeV, and \u03b1 < 169 \u2022 . After imposing quality requirements, the data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 5.2 fb \u22121 . The previous D0 publications [7,8] used a subset of this data sample, and are superseded by the results obtained in this Letter.",

The cross sections used to estimate these contributions to the background are obtained from [12] and [13]. At the parton level, vector boson pair production and the single-top quark events are generated with pythia and comphep [14], respectively, while alpgen [15] is used for all other samples. All MC events are then processed with pythia, which performs parton showering and hadronization. The resulting samples are processed using a geant [16] simulation of the D0 detector. To model the effects of multiple interactions and detector noise, data from random pp crossings are overlaid on MC events. The cteq6l1 parameterization [17] is used for all parton density functions (PDF). Instrumental background comes mostly from multijet processes with / E T arising from energy mismeasurement.

We select events with two or three jets with |\u03b7| < 2.5 and p T > 20 GeV, and require that the interaction vertex has at least three tracks and is reconstructed within \u00b140 cm of the center of the detector along the beam direction so that the tracks are within the geometric acceptance of the silicon tracker. As the leading highest p T jets in the signal events are assumed to originate from decays of b quarks, we require that at least two jets, including the leading jet, have at least two tracks pointing to the primary vertex in order to apply b-tagging algorithms. We also require the two leading jets satisfy \u03b1 < 165 \u2022 . To reduce the contribution from W \u2192 l\u03bd decays, we veto events with isolated electrons or muons with p T > 15 GeV, as well as tau leptons that decay hadronically to a single charged particle with p T > 12 GeV when there is no associated electromagnetic cluster or p T > 10 GeV if there is such a cluster [18]. To suppress the MJ background, we require / E T > 40 GeV and / E T significance S > 5 [19]. We also remove events when the direction of the / E T overlaps with a jet in \u03c6 by requiring / E T /GeV > 80 \u2212 40 \u00d7 \u2206\u03c6 min ( / E T , jets), where \u2206\u03c6 min ( / E T , jets) denotes the minimum of the angles between the / E T and any of the selected jets. The contribution from multijet processes is determined using the techniques described in [4]. For signal events, the direction of / E T tends to be aligned with the missing track transverse momentum, / p T , defined as the negative of the vectorial sum of the p T of the charged particles. A strong correlation of this kind is not expected in multijet events, where / E T originates mainly from mismeasurement of jet energies in the calorimeter. We exploit this difference by requiring D < \u03c0/2 for signal, where D is the azimuthal distance between / E T and / p T , \u2206\u03c6( / E T , / p T ), and use events with D > \u03c0/2 to model the kinematic distributions of the MJ background in the signal sample after subtracting the contribution from SM processes. The MJ background is normalized before b-tagging by requiring the number of observed events in data to equal the sum of SM and MJ contributions in the D < \u03c0/2 region. The signal contribution is assumed to be zero. Figure 1 shows the / E T distribution and the background contributions from SM and MJ sources after these selections. A neural network (NN) b-tagging algorithm [20] is used to identify heavy-flavor jets, and reduce the SM and MJ backgrounds that are dominated by light flavor jets. We apply b-tagging and use the requirements on the NN output that give one jet to be tagged with an average efficiency of \u224870% and the other with an average efficiency of \u224850%, where the corresponding probabilities of a light-flavored jet to be wrongly identified as a b-jet are \u22486.5% and \u22480.5%, respectively. These conditions are designed to optimize the discovery reach for ab 1 and LQ 3 .",

In this technique, an ensemble of MC experiments using the expected numbers of signal and background events is compared to the number of events observed in data to derive an exclusion limit. Signal and background contributions are varied within their uncertainties taking into account correlations among their systematic uncertainties. The LQ 3 andb 1 (m\u03c70 1 = 0) observed and expected cross section limits are given in Table II.  Figure 3(a) shows the 95% C.L. upper limits on the cross section as a function of m LQ , together with the theoretical cross section \u03c3 th assuming B = 1. The uncertainty on \u03c3 th is obtained by varying the renormalization and factorization scales by a factor of two from the nominal choice \u00b5 = m LQ and incorporating the PDF uncertainties [6]. Limits on m LQ are obtained from the intersection of the observed cross section limit with the central \u03c3 th and yield a lower mass limit of 247 GeV for B = 1 for the production of third-generation leptoquarks. If the 95% C.L. experimental limit is compared with the one standard deviation lower value of \u03c3 th , we obtain a mass limit of m LQ = 238 GeV. Also shown is the central value of \u03c3 th when the coupling to the b\u03bd and t\u03c4 channels are identical, yielding B = 1 \u2212 0.5 \u00d7 F sp where F sp is a phase space suppression factor for the \u03c4 t channel [8]. The mass limit in this case is 234 GeV. Figure 3(b) shows the excluded region in the plane of the bottom squark versus neutralino mass obtained using the central \u03c3 th . For m\u03c70 1 = 0, the limit is mb 1 > 247 GeV. The exclusion region extends to m\u03c70 1 = 110 GeV for 160 < mb 1 < 200 GeV. In conclusion, in the 5.2 fb \u22121 data sample studied, the observed number of events with the topology of two bjets plus missing transverse energy is consistent with that",

These results are interpreted as mass limits and give a limit of 247 GeV for B = 1 for the production of charge-1/3 third-generation scalar leptoquarks. We also exclude the production of bottom squarks for a range of values in the (mb 1 , m\u03c70 1 ) mass plane such as mb 1 > 247 GeV for m\u03c70 1 = 0 and m\u03c70 1 > 110 GeV for 160 < mb 1 < 200 GeV. These limits significantly extend previous results.",
