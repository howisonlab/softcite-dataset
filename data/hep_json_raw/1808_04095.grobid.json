These particles are expected to travel with a velocity significantly below the speed of light, and therefore have a specific ionisation higher than any high-momentum Standard Model particle of unit charge. The pixel subsystem of the ATLAS detector is used in this search to measure the ionisation energy loss of all reconstructed charged particles which traverse the pixel detector. Results are interpreted assuming the pair production of R-hadrons as composite colourless states of a long-lived gluino and Standard Model partons. No significant deviation from Standard Model background expectations is observed, and lifetime-dependent upper limits on R-hadron production cross-sections and gluino masses are set, assuming the gluino always decays to two quarks and a 100 GeV stable neutralino. R-hadrons with lifetimes above 1.0 ns are excluded at the 95% confidence level, with lower limits on the gluino mass ranging between 1290 GeV and 2060 GeV. In the case of stable R-hadrons, the lower limit on the gluino mass at the 95% confidence level is 1890 GeV.",

These particles appear in proposed solutions to the gauge hierarchy problem [1], including supersymmetric (SUSY) models that either violate [2][3][4] or conserve [5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12] R-parity. R-parity is a quantum number defined as (-1 )3(B-L)+2S where S is the particle spin and L and B are, respectively, its lepton and baryon number. Within SUSY models, sparticles, including gluinos, may be longlived, with lifetimes depending, for instance, on the mass hierarchy parameters, or on the size of any R-parity-violating coupling [13].",

It consists of a tracker for measuring the trajec tories of charged particles inside a 2 T solenoidal magnetic field, followed by calorimeters for measuring the energy of particles that interact electromagnetically or hadronically. A muon spectrometer immersed in a toroidal magnetic field surrounds the calorimeters, and provides tracking for muons. A two-level trigger system is used to select events [24]. The first-level trigger is implemented in hardware and uses a subset of the detector information. This is fol lowed by the software-based high-level trigger, which runs offline reconstruction and calibration software, reducing the event rate to about 1 kHz. The detector is hermetic and can therefore mea sure the magnitude of the missing transverse momentum (E miss) associated with each event. The tracker is made of three detec tor systems organised in concentric layers. The outermost layer is made of densely packed proportional gas-filled detectors [25], the radial region from roughly 30 cm to 55 cm is equipped with sil icon microstrip detectors [26] and the innermost layer is covered by a silicon pixel detector [19], which is described below in some detail as it has a crucial role in this analysis.",

The charge of a cluster is calculated by summing the charge of all pixels belonging to the cluster after calibration corrections. To avoid loss of charge, only clusters completely con tained in sensor fiducial regions are used (e.g. clusters cannot be in contact with pixels on the sensor edge). The dE/dx for each re constructed track is calculated using the average of the individual cluster ionisation measurements (charge collected in the cluster per unit track length in the sensor), for the clusters associated with a track. To reduce the impact of the tails of the Landau distribution, which is expected to describe the energy deposition distribution, the track dE/dx is evaluated using a truncated-mean method. The average is calculated after removing the highest-dE/dx cluster, or the two highest-dE/dx clusters in the relatively rare case of more than four clusters associated with the track. More details of the calculation of dE/dx may be found in Ref. [21].",

A second signal region targets stable R -hadrons which do not de cay within the detector.

In metastable R-hadron events, the mea sured ET miss largely originates from neutralinos which carry away unmeasured momenta. In stable R -hadron events, the R-hadrons leave only modest energy depositions in the calorimeters [30] and only a fraction are reconstructed as muons due to their late arrival time in the muon spectrometer. Therefore, most of the momenta of R -hadrons are not accounted for in the measurement of E \u2122ss, and only QCD initial-state radiation (ISR) provides a visible contribu tion that results in a measured imbalance. Due to the neutralinos, the ET miss trigger efficiency is higher for metastable than for stable R -hadrons. The track reconstruction efficiency is, on the contrary, higher for the stable R-hadrons and penalises particles with life times shorter than 10 ns, which may not have crossed enough detector layers. The searches for stable and metastable R-hadrons require slightly different optimisations.",

In the reconstruction, ET miss is built from calibrated muons and electrons which pass baseline selec tions, from calibrated jets reconstructed with the anti-/ct jet clus tering algorithm [51] with radius parameter R = 0.4 using clusters of energy depositions in the calorimeter as inputs, and from a term that includes soft tracks not associated with any other ob jects in the event [52] but consistent with the primary vertex (PV).

To ensure a good calculation of E\u2122ss, events are rejected if they contain a jet with ET > 20 GeV that is consistent with detector noise or beam-induced backgrounds, as determined from shower shape information. Unlike in standard ATLAS selections for jet-cleaning [53], a requirement on the rela tionship between track and calorimeter measurements of pT and a requirement on the fraction of jet energy deposited in the elec tromagnetic calorimeter are not applied as they are found to be inefficient for signal events in which an R-hadron decays before or inside the calorimeters.

This uncertainty is assessed by comparing the nominal background estimate with an estimate per formed in n bins. Additionally, an uncertainty of 1%-25% in the background yield arises from residual correlations between p and dE/dx for tracks entering the background calculation.

The uncertainty ranges from 14% for gluino masses of 600 GeV to 36% for masses of 2200 GeV. An additional uncertainty in the number of produced signal events of 2.1% is due to the uncertainty in the dataset luminosity, which is measured in dedicated x-y beam-separation scans performed in May 2016 using a method similar to one described in Ref. [57]. The largest uncertainty on the signal efficiency results from the modelling of ISR production, which affects the ET miss distribu tion. This uncertainty is estimated as half the difference between the expected number of events calculated with the Pythia 6.4.27 gluino-gluino pT distribution and with the distribution reweighted to match that of the MADGRAPH5_aMC@NL0 sample. This uncer tainty depends on both the lifetime and mass of the signal sample and ranges from 1% for lifetimes up to 10 ns to 19% for stable samples. Uncertainties ranging from 1% to 6% in the efficiency of the dE/dx selection are included to account for both the shape difference between the ionisation distributions in data and MC simulation and the scale shift in data due to radiation damage. The efficiency of selecting tracks with at least two measurements used to determine the dE/dx depends on the operating conditions of the detector and the instantaneous luminosity. The accuracy of the simulation in modelling this efficiency is tested in Z events in both data and MC simulation; the maximum difference in effi ciency as a function of pile-up is found to be 6%, which is taken as an uncertainty. Additional uncertainties, each less than 5%, on the signal selection efficiency are due to uncertainties in how well the simulation models trigger and offline E \u2122ss, the pile-up distri bution, the scale and uncertainty of the momentum measurement, and the efficiency for reconstructing stable R-hadrons as muons.",

The largest deviation from the backgroundonly hypothesis is found to have a local significance of 2.4a and is in the stable R-hadron SR in the mass bin designed to cover a 600 GeV gluino (with a mass window from 500 to 5000 GeV). The source of this deviation is a mild excess of data events relative to the background prediction around 500-800 GeV. In the absence of any significant excess, model-independent up per limits at 95% CL on the visible production cross-sections are calculated by dividing the number of signal events consistent at the 95% CL with the expected background and observed data in the most inclusive mass window for each SR by the integrated luminosity. For the metastable R-hadron SR, the p-value for the background-only hypothesis is 0.15 in the window from 500 to 5000 GeV, and the upper limit on the visible production cross section is 0.35 fb with an expected limit of 0.25-q09 fb. In the stable R-hadron SR mass window from 300 to 5000 GeV, the background-only p-value is 0.09 and the model-independent up per limit on the visible production cross-section is 0.88 fb, with an expected limit of 0.57+q22 fb.
