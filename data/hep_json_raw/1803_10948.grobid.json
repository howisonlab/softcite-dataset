            "text": "After measuring in 2012 a relatively large value of the neutrino mixing angle \u03b8 13 , the door is now open to observe for the first time a possible CP violation in the leptonic sector. The measured value of \u03b8 13 also privileges the 2nd oscillation maximum for the discovery of CP violation instead of the usually used 1st maximum. The sensitivity at this 2nd oscillation maximum is about three times higher, with a lower influence of systematic errors, than for the 1st maximum. Going to the 2nd oscillation maximum necessitates a very intense neutrino beam with the appropriate energy. The world's most intense pulsed spallation neutron source, the European Spallation Source, will have a proton linac with 5 MW power and 2 GeV energy. This linac, under construction, also has the potential to become the proton driver of the world's most intense neutrino beam with high probability to discover a neutrino CP violation. The physics performance of that neutrino Super Beam in conjunction with a megaton underground Water Cherenkov neutrino detector installed at a distance of about 500 km from ESS has been evaluated. In addition, the choice of such detector will extent the physics program to proton-decay and astrophysics searches. The ESS proton linac upgrades, the accumulator ring needed for proton pulse compression, the target station, the far detector and the physics potential are described. In addition to neutrinos, this facility will also produce at the same time a copious number of muons which could be used by a low energy neutrino facility for sterile neutrino searches, a future Neutrino Factory or a Muon Collider. The ESS neutron facility will be fully ready by 2023 at which moment the upgrades for the neutrino facility could start.",

Several proposals have been placed proposing to work as usual on the 1st oscillation maximum, mainly for statistical reasons. The success of these projects strongly depends on the systematic errors, which values will definitely be known at the end of the project. To mitigate this problem, one possibility is to work on the 2nd oscillation maximum where the dependence on systematic errors is significantly lower compared to the 1st oscillation maximum [1,2,3]. Moreover, the sensitivity to matter-antimatter asymmetry is higher at the 2nd oscillation maximum since its value is proportional to 0.75 sin \u03b4 CP , instead of 0.3 sin \u03b4 CP at the 1st oscillation maximum. The drawback is that significantly higher statistics are needed.",

By using a target station similar to the one proposed by the EU FP7 EURO\u03bd Design Study [5,6] and 25 m length hadron decay tunnel, the neutrino/antineutrino spectrum of Fig. 2 can be obtained per year (200 days). Preliminarily, it is supposed that the facility will be operated during two years in neutrino mode (positive current in the magnetic horn) and eight years in antineutrino mode (negative current) in order to detect in the far detector the same number of neutrinos than antineutrinos.  From Table 2 it can be seen that a relatively pure muon neutrino beam can be obtained. Since for the CP violation observation the oscillation \u03bd \u00b5 \u2192 \u03bd e will be used, any presence of electron neutrinos in the primary neutrino beam will disturb this study. The primary electron neutrino contribution is only 0.5%, low enough to significantly affect this study. This contribution could be used by a near detector to study the electron neutrino cross-section at the relevant energies of this project. For this purpose, a strong rejection of muon neutrino and neutral current events has to be obtained.",

This far detector could be placed in or near an active mine with suitable rock characteristics. Two mines have been identified in Sweden suited to host this detector. The first mine, Zinkgruvan, is located at a distance of 360 km from Lund, while the second one, Garpenberg, at 540 km. MEMPHYS, with its 500 kt fiducial volume (two cylinders of 65 m diameter and 100 m height), could also be used for proton decay searches, super nova neutrino detection, solar and atmospheric neutrinos. In these studies, the performance of MEMPHYS, as reported in [9], has been used. The \u03bd e detection is of the order of 50% for a PMT photocathode coverage of 30%. This coverage could now be increased by keeping the same price by using MCP-PMTs, as those used by the JUNO experiment [10]. This option is now under investigation. Fig. 3 shows the detected neutrino energy distribution for a far detector placed in Garpenberg mine (540 km). The first (second) plot presents the distribution for neutrino two (eight) years run. For both modes, neutrino/antineutrino, about 300  \u03bd e 's coming from the muon neutrino oscillation are expected to be detected. The mean neutrino energy is of the order of 0.4 MeV, region around which the neutrino interaction cross-sections drops down very quickly. On the other side, almost only quasi-elastic events are expected avoiding \u03c0 0 production in the resonant regime. The absence of \u03c0 0 's explain the low background of Fig. 3.",

In order not to go out of the already allocated area of ESS, a ring with a circumference of bout 400 m is proposed, reducing the proton pulses to about 1.5 \u00b5s. Due to space-charge effects at the entrance of the accumulator, H \u2212 ions have to be used, which would be stripped just before entering the ring. This implies that H \u2212 , instead of protons, have to be produced and accelerated in the ESS linac. The modifications needed to accelerate H \u2212 have already been studied. While no showstoppers have been identified, the cost of these modifications is not negligible and is of the order of 250 Me(including a 2.5 GeV proton energy upgrade). All these studies can be found in a CERN report [11]. A target station is needed at the exit of the accumulator to produce the neutrino beam. For this, ESS\u03bdSB has adopted the design already proposed by EURO\u03bd. In this design, taking into account the relatively low proton energy, the target is placed inside the magnetic horn. In order to mitigate the effect of the very intense proton beam, a four target/horn system is proposed. To keep the system as simple as possible, no reflector is used. Under these conditions, each target is supposed to receive 1/4 of the total 5 MW proton power. For cooling reasons, each target is composed of a canister fulfilled with titanium alloy spheres (few mm diameter). In this way, He gas can circulate around the spheres to remove the heat and potential vibration problems could also be avoided.",

Fig. 6 [12] presents the significance versus \u03b4 CP to discover CP violation, while Fig. 7 shows the significance as a function of the covered \u03b4 CP range. For a 5 \u03c3 discovery, a coverage of about 60% of \u03b4 CP values is obtained. For these evaluations the systematic errors reported in [13] have been used (mainly 5%/10% systematics for signal/background).  Further optimisations engaged now in the approved EU H2020 Design Study ESS\u03bdSB could improve this performance on CP violation discovery. This EU project has started the 1st of January 2018 and will last for four years. At the end of this study a Conceptual Design Report (CDR) of the whole neutrino facility will be delivered.",
