With this product, we determine the D \u2192 K semileptonic form factor f K + (0) = 0.737 \u00b1 0.004 \u00b1 0.000 in conjunction with the value of |V cs | determined from the standard model global fit. Alternately, with the product together with the input of the form factor f K + (0) calculated in lattice quantum chromodynamics (LQCD) recently, we extract |V cs | D\u2192K e + \u03bd e = 0.962 \u00b1 0.005 \u00b1 0.014, where the error is still dominated by the uncertainty of the form factor calculated in LQCD. Combining the |V cs | D + s \u2192 + \u03bd = 1.012 \u00b1 0.015 \u00b1 0.009 extracted from all existing measurements of D + s \u2192 + \u03bd decays and |V cs | D\u2192K e + \u03bd e = 0.962\u00b10.005\u00b10.014 together, we find the most precisely determined |V cs | to be |V cs | = 0.983\u00b10.011, which improves the accuracy of the PDG'2014 value |V cs | PDG 2014 = 0.986 \u00b1 0.016 by 45 %.",

In 2009, the CLEO Collaboration studied the semileptonic decays of D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 e + \u03bd e and D + \u2192K 0 e + \u03bd e by analyzing 818 pb \u22121 data collected at 3.773 GeV with the CLEO-c detector. Using double tag method, they measured the decay rates for semileptonic D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 e + \u03bd e and D + \u2192K 0 e + \u03bd e decays in nine q 2 bins [21]. These measurements of decay rates are summarized in Tables 1 and 2. In 2006, the Belle Collaboration published the results on the D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 + \u03bd decays. They accumulated 56461 \u00b1 309 \u00b1 830 inclusive D 0 mesons and found 1318 \u00b1 37 \u00b1 7 signal events for D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 e + \u03bd e decays and 1249 \u00b1 37 \u00b1 25 signal events for D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03bc + \u03bd \u03bc decays from a 282 fb \u22121 data set collected around 10.58 GeV with the Belle detector [22]. Using these selected events from semileptonic D 0 decays, they obtained the form factors f K + (q 2 ) in 27 q 2 bins with the bin size of 0.067 GeV 2 /c 4 . To obtain the product f K + (q 2 i )|V cs | which will be used in our comprehensive analysis in Sect. 3, we extrapolate these measurements of form factors at the Belle experiment to the product f K + (q 2 i )|V cs | using the PDG'2006 value of |V cs | = 0.97296\u00b10.00024 [23] which was originally used in the Belle's paper published. Table 4 lists the form factors f K + (q 2 i ) measured at the Belle experiment and our translated products f K + (q 2 i )|V cs |.

As a consequence, the experimentally measured branching fractions or partial decay rates usually include the contribution from the soft photon emission in the final states more or less. The theoretical prediction for the decay rate, Eq. (1), used in the extractions of form factor f K + (0) and CKM matrix element |V cs | is for the tree-level semileptonic D decay process. As the experimental precision of the decay rate measurement has already achieved an accuracy level of 0.5 %, in addition to improve the precision of the LQCD calculation for f K + (0), it should be also necessary to take into account the radiative correction in further precise determination of |V cs |. However, unlike the situation in K 3 decays, due to the lack of an universally valid effective theory, the theoretical or phenomenological estimation of radiative corrections in the semileptonic D decays is absent at present stage. So we ignore this radiative correction in the analysis at present.",

This obtained product reflects all of measurements for D \u2192 K e + \u03bd e decays in the world in the last 25 years.

Alternately, with the recent most precise semileptonic D \u2192 K e + \u03bd e decay form factor calculated in LQCD, we obtain the |V cs | D\u2192K e + \u03bd e = 0.962 \u00b1 0.005 \u00b1 0.014, where the error is dominated by the uncertainties in LQCD calculation of the hadronic form factor.
