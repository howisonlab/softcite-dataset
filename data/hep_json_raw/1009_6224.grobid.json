This study focuses on the extraction of the double helicity asymmetry in \u03b7 production ( p + p \u2192 \u03b7 + X), the \u03b7 cross section and the \u03b7/\u03c0 0 cross section ratio. The cross section and ratio measurements provide essential input for the extraction of fragmentation functions that are needed to access the helicity-dependent parton distribution functions.",

            "text": "Until recently, the knowledge about helicity-dependent parton distribution functions (PDFs) in the nucleon mainly came from next-to-leading order (NLO) QCD fits (see, e.g., [1]) to the helicity-dependent structure function g 1 , as measured in fixed-target polarized inclusive deep-inelastic scattering (DIS) experiments (see, e.g., [2,3]). The resulting helicity-dependent PDF for the gluon has rather large uncertainties due to the fact that the exchanged virtual photon does not couple directly, i.e., at leading order, to the gluon, and that an indirect way of accessing it via NLO fits to g 1 suffers from the limited kinematic reach of the fixed target experiments. Accessing the helicitydependent gluon PDF via the so-called photon-gluon-fusion process in semi-inclusive DIS has not yet resulted in better constraints, see Ref. [4,5] and references therein for details. Thus, additional data from polarized p + p scattering, in which longitudinally polarized gluons are directly probed via scattering off longitudinally polarized gluons or quarks, has the potential to reduce the uncertainties in the helicity-dependent gluon PDF. This has been demonstrated in a global NLO fit [6] using, for the first time, the available inclusive and semi-inclusive polarized DIS data together with first results from polarized p + p scattering at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The results included were the double helicity asymmetries in inclusive \u03c0 0 [7][8][9] and jet [10] production from the PHENIX and STAR experiments, respectively.",

The measurement of the \u03b7 double helicity asymmetry adds independent data with different systematics to the present set of polarized data available to PDF fits. Even when compared to a closely related data set, e.g., the PHENIX \u03c0 0 data on double helicity asymmetries, the difference in the fragmentation functions can lead to a different sensitivity to certain helicity-dependent PDFs. In contrast to the \u03c0 0 , the experimental data available to extract \u03b7 fragmentation functions is rather limited. The existing \u03b7 cross section measurements from e + + e \u2212 collider data can constrain the quark fragmentation functions to some degree, but the extraction of gluon fragmentation functions requires either rather precise e + + e \u2212 data taken in a wide range of center of mass energies, or cross section measurements from processes where gluons are directly involved, e.g., p + p scattering. Therefore, the data on cross sections and cross section ratios presented here serve as important input for the extraction of fragmentation functions, in particular as the measurement has been performed over a wide range of p T .",

First, since showers in the EMCal are not confined to a single tower, a shower profile analysis can be used to reject hadrons, which usually produce broader showers than photons. Since hadrons are slower than photons, an additional time of flight cut is used for photon identification. Furthermore, the cluster must not be associated with a hit from a charged particle in the Pad Chamber (PC3) just in front of the EMCal; an exception is made if the hit position in the EMCal and in the PC3 are aligned in such a way that the particle could have come from the vertex on a straight line, i.e., it was not bent in the central magnetic field. In this case, the cluster is accepted as a photon candidate since it is likely that the original photon converted into an e + e \u2212 pair before the PC3 but outside the magnetic field. The latter two selection cuts are used in the analysis of the double helicity asymmetry but not in the extraction of the cross sections, leading to a smaller signal to background ratio in the cross section measurements. In order to exclude clusters with potentially incorrectly reconstructed energies due to leakage effects, the tower with the largest energy deposition in a cluster must not be in the outermost two columns or rows of an EMCal sector.

Using the selection cuts for the cross section extraction on the high-p T triggered data set, the resulting invariant mass distributions in the vicinity of the \u03b7 peak are shown in Fig. 1 for three different bins of p T . For bins at small p T , the signal extraction is based on fits to the invariant mass distributions using a Gaussian for the signal plus a second-order polynomial for the background that describe the vicinity of the \u03b7 and \u03c0 0 peaks very well. For p T > \u223c 10 GeV/c the signal extraction based on fits becomes unreliable as limited statistics leads to large fluctuations in the fit results for the mean and width of the peaks. Therefore, the mean and width are taken from a Monte-Carlo simulation, which describes the mean and width of the \u03b7 and \u03c0 0 peaks as a function of p T very well for bins in the mid-p T range between 3 GeV/c and 10 GeV/c, giving confidence in using them for the bins above. This is demonstrated in Fig. 2 for the case of \u03b7 production. The small discrepancies at p T < 3 GeV/c are due to the large background underneath the peak, as can be seen in the top panel of Fig. 1, which is not modeled in the MC. Thus, above p T = 3 GeV/c the number of background counts under the signal peak can be estimated by using the number of counts in the sidebands. The sidebands are on both sides of the mean of the peak, between 4 and 7 (4 and 6) times the Gaussian width of the peak for the cross section (double helicity asymmetry) analysis. However, the exact position and width of the sidebands are varied and possible effects are taken into account in the systematic uncertainty. In the mid-p T range between 3 GeV/c and 10 GeV/c, where statistics is sufficient for the fit results to be stable and the background in the vicinity of the peaks is approximately linear so that the sideband subtraction is applicable, both methods agree as expected.

The luminosity is calculated from the number of MB events divided by the cross section for events selected by the MB trigger. For the latter, a value of 23.0 mb with a systematic uncertainty of 9.7% has been derived from Vernier scan results [15] and an extrapolation for subsequent years. The acceptance is calculated from a Monte-Carlo simulation using, as an input, the map of noisy and dead cells also used in the data analysis. The systematic uncertainty on the acceptance calculation is 3.6% (3%) for the \u03b7 (\u03c0 0 ) meson. The trigger efficiency for the MB data is given by the MB trigger efficiency for \u03b7 and \u03c0 0 production. The trigger efficiency for the high-p T triggered data set is given by the MB trigger efficiency times the efficiency of the high-p T trigger. The MB (high-p T ) trigger efficiency is determined by the ratio of the number of reconstructed \u03c0 0 or \u03b7 mesons in a high-p T (MB) triggered sample in coincidence with the MB (high-p T ) trigger divided by the number of reconstructed \u03c0 0 or \u03b7 events without the coincidence. The MB trigger efficiency is 0.78 for both \u03c0 0 and \u03b7 mesons over the whole range of p T considered, with a systematic uncertainty of 3%. The high-p T trigger efficiency reaches a plateau at a level of 0.90 for p T > 4.5 GeV/c and is also very similar for both mesons. Due to the fact that the turn-on curve of the high p T trigger is very steep and reaches an efficiency of about 0.80 in the 3 < p T < 3.5 GeV/c bin, the efficiency for p T < 3 GeV/c has a large systematic uncertainty. Therefore, the cross section calculation is based on the smaller MB triggered data set for p T < 3 GeV/c and on the high-p T triggered data set for larger transverse momenta. The reconstruction efficiency accounts for loss of photons due to conversion (6% \u00b12%) and due to the cut on the shower shape discussed above (4% \u00b12%). In the case of \u03c0 0 production, merging of the two decay photons into a single cluster is considered for p T > 10 GeV/c. The \u03b7 cross section as a function of p T between 2 and 20 GeV/c is shown in Fig. 3 and tabulated in Table I. Note that a bin-shift correction is applied in order to be able to plot each data point at the center of each given p T bin, which, due to the exponentially falling spectrum, does not represent the true physical value of the yield in that bin [16]. This in particular facilitates the calculation of the \u03b7/\u03c0 0 cross section ratio.",

The other dominant systematic uncertainties are an approximately p T -independent uncertainty of about 8% due to the uncertainty on the global energy scale of 1.2%, possible nonlinearities in the energy scale affecting mainly points with p T > 10 GeV/c, and uncertainties from the signal extraction affecting principally the two lowest p T points, which have 1.64\u00d710 \u221210 0.95\u00d710 \u221210 0.07\u00d710 \u221210 0.22\u00d710 \u221210 a large background underneath the \u03b7 peak. The systematic uncertainties are subdivided into uncertainties that are uncorrelated between p T bins (type-A), correlated between p T bins (type-B), and overall normalization uncertainties (type-C). As described above, the peak extraction is based on different methods depending on p T . Thus, the p T bins in certain regions are correlated, but there is no full correlation over the whole range. Such kind of uncertainties are sub-categorized as type-B 1 , in order to distinguish from those correlated over all p T bins (type-B 2 ). All other uncertainties, except the one from the luminosity measurement (type-C), are assumed to be in this category. The \u03b7 cross section from p + p scattering presented here, together with the above mentioned earlier PHENIX data [17], and various \u03b7 cross section measurements from e + + e \u2212 scattering have been used in a global fit to extract new fragmentation functions for \u03b7 production at NLO [18]. The wide p T range of this measurement, as compared to the earlier PHENIX measurement, which covers a range in p T from 2.5 to 12 GeV/c, is important, because it allows for a much more stringent constraint on the \u03b7 fragmentation function, as can be seen in Figs. 6 and 8 of Ref.

While the corresponding uncertainties are difficult to quantify, it is clear that the subprocess contributions to the \u03b7 and \u03c0 0 production are, within uncertainties, identical up to a p T of approximately 10 GeV/c. This is the kinematic range of the \u03b7 and \u03c0 0 double helicity asymmetries presented below and published in Ref. [7,8], respectively. Consequently, these measurements have approximately the same sensitivity to the gluon helicity distribution accessible via the gg and qg subprocesses. The differences at larger values of p T are mostly related to uncertainties in the fragmentation functions and thus do not necessarily indicate different sensitivities to polarized PDFs. Constraining the fragmentation function further should be possible by including precise \u03b7 to \u03c0 0 cross section ratios in the extraction. The cross section ratio, as a function of p T , is given in Fig. 5 and Table II. The ratio has been extracted in a single pass over the same data set, thus minimizing systematic uncertainties. In particular, the large normalization uncertainty of 9.7% arising from the luminosity calculation cancels completely. Also all other systematic uncertainties are assumed to either cancel or be reduced to a negligible amount with the exception of the following. The systematic uncertainties due to the \u03b7 and \u03c0 0 peak extraction (type-B 1 ) and due to the correction for possible merging of the two \u03c0 0 decay photons into a single cluster (type-B 2 ) do not cancel. Furthermore, while the uncertainties on the high-p T trigger efficiency (type-B 2 ) are assumed to cancel above p T = 4.5 GeV/c where the efficiency is flat, a remaining 2% uncertainty on the ratio is assigned for differences in the trigger turn-on curve for 3 < p T < 4.5 GeV/c. Finally, the systematic uncertainty on the acceptance (type-B 2 ) is reduced to a p T independent contribution of 2%.",

The latter is due to the fact that for increasing transverse momenta the two photons from the \u03c0 0 have a strongly increasing probability of being reconstructed as only a single cluster in the calorimeter, leading to a rather large systematic uncertainty arising from the correction for this effect. Except for an initial increase due to the different meson masses, the data do not exhibit a strong dependence on p T . This hints towards a similar dependence of the \u03b7 and \u03c0 0 fragmentation functions on the energy fraction of the parton carried by the hadron. Fitting the cross section ratio, including its statistical and type-B 1 systematic uncertainty, to a constant, gives R \u03b7/\u03c0 0 = 0.51 \u00b1 0.01 (\u03c7 2 /ndf = 18.3/17), with a remaining systematic uncertainty of 0.01 from the type-B 2 systematic uncertainty.

This indicates that the constraints from the separate fits are less stringent than fitting the cross section ratio directly. This is obvious from the fact that some of the experimental systematic uncertainties cancel in the ratio as already discussed above, in particular the overall normalization uncertainty of 9.7% due to the uncertainty in the luminosity measurement. For example, the earlier PHENIX data used in the extraction of the \u03c0 0 fragmentation functions was scaled by a factor of 1.09 [24] in the fit, which is within the experimental normalization uncertainty, but leads to a smaller calculated cross section ratio as can be seen in Fig. 5. Also, the dependence of the calculated \u03b7 and \u03c0 0 cross sections on the theoretical scale, as shown in, e.g., Fig. 3, largely cancels in the calculation of the ratio [20]. Hence it appears that improved constraints on \u03b7 and \u03c0 0 fragmentation functions can be derived by directly including the data on the \u03b7/\u03c0 0 cross section ratio in the fit.",

The average polarization value for the data from 2005 (2006) is 0.49 (0.57). There is a relative uncertainty of 4.8% in the product of the beam polarizations, correlated between the 2005 and 2006 data sets, which is a scale uncertainty on the combined asymmetry result, affecting both the central values and the statistical uncertainties such that the statistical significance of the measurement from zero is preserved. Uncertainties on the products of the beam polarizations that are uncorrelated between years are combined using the same weight factors as for the uncertainties due to relative luminosity, and given in Table III. In order to avoid false asymmetries due to a possible variation of detector response versus time or due to a possible correlation of detector performance with the RHIC bunch structure, all four helicity combinations in the colliding bunches are present within four consecutive bunch crossings. Possible transverse components of the beam polarizations at the PHENIX interaction point are monitored by measuring the spin dependence of very forward neutron production [30] in the zero degree calorimeters [31]. The average transverse component of the product in the 2005 data set is less than 0.014 \u00b1 0.003, described in more detail in Ref. [7], and was measured to be negligible in the 2006 data set.",

In the future, with improved statistics and the availability of flavor-separated fragmentation functions, double-helicity asymmetries in \u03b7 production can potentially constrain the polarized strange quark PDF (\u2206s) due to the additional s-quark contribution in the \u03b7 wave function. Special interest in \u2206s arises from the fact that its value is negative, when extracted from analyses of inclusive DIS data, using hyperon decay data and assuming SU(3) flavor symmetry [2,3], but consistent with zero, when directly extracted from semi-inclusive DIS data [33][34][35]. Global fits can constrain PDFs by simultaneously describing a wide variety of experimental channels over a An additional systematic uncertainty of 4.8% on the vertical scale due to the uncertainty in the beam polarizations is not shown.

In particular due to the wide range in transverse momentum these data serve as important input for the extraction of fragmentation functions. The \u03b7 to \u03c0 0 cross section ratio as a function of p T has been extracted in a single pass over the same data set, thus minimizing systematic uncertainties. A fit to a constant above p T = 2 GeV/c or p T = 3 GeV/c yields a value of R \u03b7/\u03c0 0 = 0.51 \u00b1 0.01 stat \u00b1 0.01 syst . The inclusion of these data on the ratio in future fragmentation function extractions should allow for more precise results for both particle species.

The results are compared to NLO pQCD calculations using two different sets of polarized PDFs[6,32]. See text for details.",
