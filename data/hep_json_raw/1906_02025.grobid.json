The BEH mechanism not only predicts the existence of a massive scalar particle, but also requires this scalar particle to couple to itself. Therefore, observing the production of Higgs  Any deviation from the Standard Model (SM) predictions would open a window to new physics. Moreover, the form of the Higgs field potential, which generates the Higgs boson self-coupling after electroweak symmetry breaking, can have important cosmological implications, involving, for example, predictions for vacuum stability or models in which the Higgs boson acts as the inflation field [7][8][9][10].",

In the EWK-singlet model, the scalar states are mixed, with a mixing angle \u03b1. The ratio of the vacuum expectation value of the additional singlet to that of the SM Higgs doublet, tan \u03b2, is a free parameter. In the hMSSM, the CP-even states also mix, and the model's phenomenology can be described by the mass (m A ) of a third, CP-odd, resonance and the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two Higgs doublets, tan \u03b2. Alternatively, the Higgs boson pair can be produced resonantly through the decay of a spin-2 Kaluza-Klein (KK) graviton, as predicted in the Randall-Sundrum (RS) model of warped extra dimensions [32]. A schematic diagram for production of a heavy resonance followed by its decay into a Higgs boson pair is shown in Fig. 1 (d).",

In part of the 2016 data period, inefficiencies in the online vertex reconstruction affected b-jet triggers that were used in the resolved analysis, reducing the total available integrated luminosity to 27.5 fb \u22121 . The boosted analysis searches for two large-R jets containing the b-quark pairs from the de-cays of the two Higgs bosons. The large-R jets are identified as originating from b-quarks using a b-tagging algorithm applied to R = 0.2 track-jets [53] associated with the large-R jet [54]. The analysis is divided into three categories: the first category selects events in which each of the two large-R jets has one b-tagged track-jet; the second category requires that one large-R jet contains two b-tagged track-jets and the other large-R jet contains one b-tagged track-jet; the third category requires that both large-R jets contain two b-tagged track-jets. For the SM H H search, only the resolved analysis is used, with two categories, one for the 2015 and another for the 2016 dataset. The resonant search is instead performed with the resolved analysis for masses in the range 260-1400 GeV, with the boosted analysis for masses in the range 800-3000 GeV, and with the combination of the two for masses in the overlapping range 800-1400 GeV.",

The q momentum is reconstructed from R = 0.4 jets. In order to suppress Z + jets and tt background, dilepton events are required to have two leptons of the same charge. Events are categorised according to the lepton flavour (ee, e\u03bc and \u03bc\u03bc). Three-lepton events are selected if the sum of the lepton charges is \u00b11. They are divided into two categories according to the number of sameflavour, opposite-charge (SFOS) lepton pairs; one category selects zero SFOS lepton pairs and a second category selects one or two SFOS lepton pairs. Four-lepton events are categorised according to the number of SFOS lepton pairs and the invariant mass (m 4 ) of the four-lepton system. Four categories are defined, requiring that the number of SFOS lepton pairs is less than two or equal to two, and m 4 is smaller or larger than 180 GeV. A total of nine categories are fit simultaneously in the searches for both non-resonant and resonant H H production. A summary of the main analysis characteristics is given in Table 1. All analyses impose a series of sequential requirements on kinematic variables to select signal events and suppress back-grounds. The bb\u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 analysis uses a boosted decision tree (BDT) [55] distribution as the final discriminant for both the nonresonant and resonant searches. For the resonant searches, the bbbb, bbW + W \u2212 and bb\u03b3 \u03b3 analyses use the H H invariant mass (m H H ) as the final discriminant, the W + W \u2212 \u03b3 \u03b3 analysis uses the \u03b3 \u03b3 invariant mass (m \u03b3 \u03b3 ), while W + W \u2212 W + W \u2212 uses simple event counting. For the SM H H search, the bbbb analysis uses the m H H distribution as a discriminant, profiting from the difference between the shapes of the signal and the dominant multi-jet background. The bb\u03b3 \u03b3 and W + W \u2212 \u03b3 \u03b3 analyses fit the m \u03b3 \u03b3 distribution to extract both the signal yield and the background expectation, while the bbW + W \u2212 and W + W \u2212 W + W \u2212 analyses use event counting.",

Uncertainties on the signal acceptance derived by varying the renormalisation and factorisation scales, the parton distribution functions and the parton shower are correlated too.

The so-called FTApprox method [63] is applied in the event generation to include finite top-quark mass effects in the real-radiation NLO corrections. The virtual-loop corrections are realised with Higgs effective field theory (HEFT) assuming infinite top-quark mass. The generated events are then corrected with a generator level bin-bybin reweighting of the m H H distribution, which is calculated with finite top-quark mass in full NLO corrections [13]. The branching fractions of the Higgs boson are assumed to be equal to the SM predictions [11].   [64]. The impact of the systematic uncertainties has been evaluated by recomputing the limit without their inclusion. The limit is then reduced by 13% when removing all of them.

The expected cross-section for each point in the parameter space is obtained by scaling the heavy Higgs cross-section calculated at NNLO+NNLL [11] with singlet coupling modifiers. The branching fractions are computed with sHDECAY [70]. In this model, the width of the heavy scalar can be large in some regions of the parameter space. Due to the use of narrow-width signal models in the event generation, results presented here are valid only in regions of the model parameter-space where the resonance width ( S ) is smaller than the experimental resolution at the resonance mass. This holds when S /m S < 2% for bb\u03b3 \u03b3 , S /m S < 5% for bbbb and S /m S < 10% for bb\u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 .

After setting all couplings to fermions and bosons to their SM values, a scan of the self-coupling modifier \u03ba \u03bb is performed. The \u03ba \u03bb factor affects both the production cross-section and the kinematic distributions of the Higgs boson pairs, by modifying the A 2 production amplitude. It can also affect the Higgs boson branching fractions due to NLO electroweak corrections[20], but this dependence is neglected in the following.The signal used in the \u03ba \u03bb fit was simulated according to the following procedure. For each value of \u03ba \u03bb the m H H spectrum is computed at the generator-level, using the leading-order (LO) version of MadGraph5_aMC@NLO[59] with the NNPDF 2.3 LO[65] PDF set, together with Pythia 8.2[66] for the showering model using the A14 tune[67]. Because only one amplitude of Higgs boson pair production depends on \u03ba \u03bb , linear combinations of three LO samples generated with different values of \u03ba \u03bb are sufficient to make predictions for any value of \u03ba \u03bb . Binned ratios of the m H H distributions to the SM distribution are computed for all \u03ba \u03bb values and then used to reweight the events of NLO SM H H signal samples, generated using the full detector simulation. This procedure is validated by comparing kinematic distributions obtained with the reweighting procedure applied to the LO SM sample and LO samples generated with the actual \u03ba \u03bb values set in the event generator. The two sets of distributions are found to be in agreement. This procedure assumes that higher order QCD corrections on the differential cross-section as a function of m H H are independent of \u03ba \u03bb . The reweighted NLO signal sample is used to compute the signal acceptance and the kinematic distributions for different values of \u03ba \u03bb .",
