Charmonium physical states have to be colorless, however they can be formed via a color-singlet (CS) or color-octet (CO) intermediate cc state. One of the first models of the charmonium production, the Color Singlet Model (CSM) [1], assumed that J/\u03c8 is created through the color-singlet state only. This early prediction failed to describe the measured charmonium cross section which has led to the development of new models. For example, Non-Relativistic QCD (NRQCD) [1] calculations were proposed in which a cc color-octet intermediate states, in addition to a color-singlet states, can bind to form charmonia.",

For many years measurements of the J/\u03c8 cross section have been used to test different J/\u03c8 production models. While many models can describe relatively well the experimental data on the J/\u03c8 cross section in p + p collisions [2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9], they have different predictions for the J/\u03c8 polarization. Therefore, measurements of the J/\u03c8 polarization may allow to discriminate among different models and provide new insight into the J/\u03c8 production mechanism.",

The STAR detector [10] is a multi-purpose detector that has large acceptance at mid-rapidity, |\u03b7| < 1 with a full azimuthal coverage. Electrons can be identified using the Time Projection Chamber (TPC) [11] through ionization energy loss (dE/dx) measurement. The Time Of Flight (TOF) detector [12] greatly enhances the electron identification capability at low momenta where the dE/dx bands for electrons and hadrons cross each other. At high p T , electron identification can be improved by the Barrel Electromagnetic Calorimeter (BEMC) [13] which measures electron energy and shower shape. The BEMC is also used to trigger on high-p T electrons (HT trigger). Minimum Bias (MB) events are triggered by the Vertex Position Detectors (VPD) [14].",

The prompt J/\u03c8 production consists of the direct one (\u223c60%) and feed-down from excited states \u03c8(2S)(\u223c10%) and \u03c7 C (\u223c30%), while non-prompt J/\u03c8 originate from B-hadron decays. STAR has estimated the contribution from B-meson decays using a measurement of azimuthal angular correlation between high-p T J/\u03c8 and charged hadrons [2,3]. The relative contribution of Bhadron decays to inclusive J/\u03c8 yield is strongly p T dependent and it is 10-25% for 4 < p T < 12 GeV/c, as it is shown on the left panel of Fig. 2.
