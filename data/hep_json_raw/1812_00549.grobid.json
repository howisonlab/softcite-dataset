One of the most common explanations is that dark matter consists of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), supposed to be cold thermal relics of the Big Bang and to build up the galactic dark halos. Indirect search of dark matter could be performed via the study of an anomalous antiproton component in cosmic rays originating from possible annihilation of dark matter pairs in the galactic halo, on top of the standard astrophysical production. The measurements performed by the AMS-02 and PAMELA spectrometers have shown that limited knowledge of antiproton-production cross sections in pp, pD, pHe and HeHe collisions is one of the main uncertainties of background subtraction. The planned SPD experiment at the NICA collider could provide a precision measurement of antiproton yield in wide kinematic range in pp and pD collisions at the energy scale from the threshold to \u221a s = 26 GeV/c.",

However, nuclei heavier than helium have a marginal role in the secondary antiproton-production. The largest contributions are from reactions that involve protons and helium (i.e. pp, pHe, He p, and HeHe). Even though experimental data on antiprotons are limited, AMS-02 have measured both the antiproton flux and the antiprotons to protons ratio (p/p). These measurements have reached an unprecedented accuracy of a few percents exceeding even the latest PAMELA results of antiprotons [1] and extended the range of absolute rigidity to 450 GeV [2], showing that thep/p reaches a plateau above \u223c 60 GeV with respect to absolute rigidity [2].",

These sources are: i) uncertainties on the primary spectra slopes at high energies, ii) uncertainties on antiproton-production cross sections, especially on reactions involving helium where there are almost no data, iii) uncertainties on the propagation parameters that determine diffusion and convection in the local galactic environment, which in turn determine the contributions of any hypothetical primary, or exotic antiproton fluxes that reach the Earth, and iv) uncertainties on the Solar modulation which involves several parameters that depend on the Solar activity at the time of observation [3]. While the last could be minimized by conservative variation of these parameters, and the first and third can be relatively reduced through the AMS-02 measurements, new measurements have to be performed to reduce uncertainties regarding production cross sections which vary from about 20% to 50% at most, depending on the energy [3]. All these sources of uncertainties are depicted in Fig. 1  [3] as colored envelopes around a fiducial curve with reference values for the different sources of uncertainties, and are superimposed to the PAMELA [1] and AMS-02 [2] data of thep/p.",

Some of the antiprotons produced in collision experiments and in CRs are a result of the decay of intermediate hyperons; namely,\u039b and\u03a3 \u2212 . While newer experiments apply a feed-down to correct the data, older ones had not been taking that into account. Thus, relevant corrections have to be applied to old datasets. And even though the ratio of antiprotons produced via hyperon decay is not large at low energies, it gains significance as the energy increases [4]. Moreover, in older studies of CRs, it was assumed that antineutrons and antiprotons were equally produced. So, antiprotons from decaying antineutrons were assumed to be equal to promptly-produced antiprotons. And due to the lack of data on antineutron production, estimations were only made through theoretical arguments. However, it was recently remarked [5,6] that the isospin of the colliding particles might favor the production of one particle or the other.",

The abundances of the light isotopes in CRs in the energy range of about a few GeV and in the ISM are presented in Tab. 1. The estimated relative contribution of interaction of the components of CRs and the ISM into the inclusive antiproton production according to [3] is listed in Tab. 2. The pD and p 3 He collisions are not mentioned in [3]. Their contribution is estimated based on the abundance of deuterium and 3 He in CRs and the assumption that the antiproton-production cross sections are 1/2 and 3/4, respectively, of the p 4 He cross section. Table 1: Abundances n i of the light isotopes in CRs [8,9] and in the ISM [10].  There are several distinct mechanisms through which antiprotons are produced. The most dominant one is direct production through proton-proton scattering (p + p \u2212\u2192 p+X). However, a considerable contribution to antiproton production comes from decay of anti-baryons. In general, due to the conservation of baryon number and the antiproton being the only stable one, any anti-baryon will eventually decay to an antiproton. In particular, decays of long-lived intermediate states, namely the\u039b and\u03a3 \u2212 hyperons and antineutrons, to antiprotons can be a convenient tool for estimation of the number of those anti-baryons [5].

            "text": "In order to detect any exotic origins of antiproton production (e.g. DM annihilation), we first need to optimize our models of other standard sources of antiprotons. However, there still is a discrepancy of accuracy between theoretical predictions and corresponding experiments, which hinders interpretation of experimental data of antiproton production. The antiproton-production cross sections in CRs inelastic interactions are considered one of the main sources of uncertainty [6]. Moreover, precision data for differential cross sections of antiproton production in proton-nucleus, nucleus-proton, and nucleusnucleus collisions are almost non-existent. While nuclei heavier than helium do not play a large role in the process, reactions involving helium represent a considerable fraction of antiproton production. This stresses the need for data if we were to maximize the use of upcoming data from AMS-02. However, for the case of pp collisions, experimental data are more abundant [12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19].",

            "text": "The Spin Physics Detector planned as a universal multipurpose setup at the NICA collider for comprehensive study of proton and deuteron interactions could make a sizable contribution to the search of physics beyond the Standard Model. We propose to use it for the precision measurements of the differential cross section of antiproton production in pp and pD collisions required by astrophysical searches for dark matter. The SPD can measure energy and angular distributions of antiprotons produced both directly and from the decays of\u039b and\u03a3 \u2212 hyperons in the kinematic range starting from the threshold. The collider mode and the 4\u03c0 geometry of the SPD detector provide a unique possibility to study the production of antiprotons at high transverse momenta (up to p T \u223c \u221a s/2) which is unavailable for fixed-target experiments. Possibility for NICA to operate with beams of light nuclei, like 3 He and 4 He, would extend this programme. The main requirements for the SPD setup in order to perform the measurements are an advanced particle identification (e.g. Time-of-Flight system), low material budget, precision reconstruction of secondary vertices, and the possibility to perform absolute luminosity measurement with accuracy of about 1%. Since at the moment only a general concept of the SPD setup exists, it is not possible to discuss the accuracy of proposed measurements. More detailed Monte Carlo studies are needed for that.",
