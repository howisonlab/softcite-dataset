The data set used corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 28.1 nb \u22121 . The J /\u03c8 mesons are reconstructed in the dimuon decay channel over the transverse momentum range 8 < p T < 30 GeV and over the center-of-mass rapidity range \u22122.87 < y * < 1.94. Prompt J /\u03c8 are separated from J /\u03c8 resulting from b-hadron decays through an analysis of the distance between the J /\u03c8 decay vertex and the event primary vertex. The differential cross section for production of nonprompt J /\u03c8 is compared to a FONLL calculation that does not include nuclear effects. Forward-backward production ratios are presented and compared to theoretical predictions. These results complement previously published results by covering a region of higher transverse momentum and more central rapidity. They thus constrain the kinematic dependence of nuclear modifications of charmonium and b-quark production in p + Pb collisions.",

            "text": "Quarkonium production in heavy-ion collisions is expected to be highly sensitive to the nature of the hot and dense matter created in these collisions [1]. Suppression of the J /\u03c8 yield in nucleus-nucleus (A + A) collisions with respect to protonproton (pp) collisions was predicted to be a signal for deconfinement in the quark-gluon plasma [2]. Such suppression was observed at fixed-target experiments at the CERN Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) [3][4][5][6][7] and in collider experiments at the BNL Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) [8][9][10] and the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) [11][12][13]. The interpretation of these results is complicated by the fact that suppression was also observed in proton-nucleus (p + A) [14][15][16][17][18][19] and deuteron-nucleus (d + A) [20] collisions, where final-state effects due to hot matter are not expected.",

For a review of these cold-medium effects see Ref. [37]. The impact of each of these mechanisms on J /\u03c8 production varies with rapidity and transverse momentum. Measurements at large rapidities probe the low-x partons in the nuclei, and gluon shadowing and saturation effects are expected to be important.",

            "text": "This observable has the advantage that it does not rely on knowledge of the J /\u03c8 production cross section in pp collisions, and that experimental and theoretical uncertainties partially cancel in the ratio. The LHCb Collaboration has recently measured R FB in the range 2.5 < |y * | < 4.0, 0 < p T < 14 GeV [15]. Results for prompt J /\u03c8 production show a strong p T dependence with R FB values significantly below unity. In contrast, the R FB for nonprompt J /\u03c8 is consistent with unity and with no p T dependence. These results are consistent with the measurements presented by the ALICE Collaboration [14] that do not separate prompt and nonprompt J /\u03c8 production. This paper presents measurements of differential cross sections for prompt and nonprompt J /\u03c8 production in p + Pb collisions at \u221a s NN = 5.02 TeV. The kinematic region 1 The c.m. rapidity is defined as y * = 1 2 ln ( E+pz E\u2212pz ), where E and p z are the energy and the component of the momentum along the proton beam direction in the nucleon-nucleon c.m. frame. 0556-2813/2015/92(3)/034904 (23) 034904-1 \u00a92015 CERN, for the ATLAS Collaboration measured spans the range 8 < p T < 30 GeV and \u22122.87 < y * < 1.94. The J /\u03c8 mesons are reconstructed using the dimuon decay mode. Nonprompt J /\u03c8 are separated from prompt J /\u03c8 by measuring displaced decay vertices. R FB measured in the range |y * | < 1.94 is presented as a function of J /\u03c8 p T and y * . The ATLAS Collaboration has previously published measurements of differential cross sections for J /\u03c8 production in pp collisions at \u221a s = 7 TeV [38].

The data were collected in two periods with different beam directions. The typical value for the mean number of interactions per bunch crossing, \u03bc , was of the order of 0.1. The luminosity was calibrated by using dedicated beam-separation scans, also known as van der Meer scans [40]. Separate calibrations were performed for each period. A systematic uncertainty of 2.7% on the luminosity was evaluated using techniques similar to those described in Ref. [41].

To illustrate the impact of the corrections, the average weights over all J /\u03c8 candidates evaluated for the kinematic intervals used in the cross-section measurement are shown in Fig. 1. The relative contributions from the kinematic acceptance and the trigger and reconstruction efficiencies are shown separately. Due to the c.m. boost, the intervals of y * used for the forward-backward asymmetry measurement span intervals in y that are not symmetric around y = 0. Those intervals are listed in Table I. In both periods the J /\u03c8 candidates with |y| < 0.47 are in the negative y * interval, whereas those with 1.47 < |y| < 2.4 are in the positive y * interval. As a result, the weights obtained for the positive and negative y * intervals are different.  The number of produced J /\u03c8 mesons and the relative fraction of nonprompt J /\u03c8 with respect to inclusive production, called the \"nonprompt fraction,\" are determined using a two-dimensional extended maximum-likelihood fit [47] of the (m \u03bc\u03bc ,\u03c4 ) spectrum of weighted J /\u03c8 candidates. The fit functions used are similar to those described in previous ATLAS publications [38]. The signal \u03c4 distribution is described using a Dirac \u03b4 function for prompt J /\u03c8 and an exponential function for nonprompt J /\u03c8; these are convolved with a Gaussian resolution function whose width is a free parameter. The background \u03c4 distribution is described with the sum of a \u03b4 function to describe prompt background, an exponential function to describe nonprompt background, and a double-sided exponential function to describe non-Gaussian tails observed at negative \u03c4 ; these are convolved with a Gaussian resolution function whose width is a free parameter not restricted to be the same as the signal resolution. The m \u03bc\u03bc spectrum is described by a \"crystal ball\" (CB) function [48] for the signal and an exponential function for the background. The complete fit model includes 15 free parameters. Fits are performed using MINUIT [49] interfaced with the ROOFIT [50] framework. The fit is performed separately in several bins of dimuon p T and y * . Figure 2 shows m \u03bc\u03bc and \u03c4 distributions in the kinematic interval 14 < p T < 20 GeV, \u22121.94 < y * < 0, and the corresponding projections of the fit function.",

As shown in Table I, J /\u03c8 candidates with 0.47 < y < 1.47 fall in the backward y * in the first period but in forward y * in the second period. Similarly, J /\u03c8 candidates with \u22121.47 < y < \u22120.47 fall in the forward y * interval in the first period but in the backward y * interval in the second period. The systematic uncertainties associated with these J /\u03c8 candidates are fully correlated, assuming they do not depend on the data-taking period. This assumption is checked, and no time dependence in the efficiency corrections is found.  [8,30] (GeV) p T range [8,30]   On the other hand, J /\u03c8 events with |y| < 0.47 always fall in the backward y * interval, and J /\u03c8 candidates with 1.47 < |y| < 2.4 always fall in the forward y * interval. The systematic uncertainties associated with these candidates are assumed to be uncorrelated. Based on these considerations, the forward-backward correlation of systematic uncertainties is estimated to be 50%. In contrast, for the measurement of R FB as a function of y * , the corresponding y intervals do not overlap. Therefore, the systematic uncertainties are assumed to be uncorrelated. A summary of systematic uncertainties in R FB is presented in Table III. Figure 6 shows R FB as a function of transverse momentum in the range 8 < p T < 30 GeV for prompt J /\u03c8 (upper panel) and for nonprompt J /\u03c8 (bottom panel). Figure 7 shows R FB as a function of y * in the range |y * | < 1.94 for prompt J /\u03c8 (upper panel) and for nonprompt J /\u03c8 (bottom panel). These results are consistent with unity within experimental uncertainties. No significant p T or y * dependence is observed, for both prompt and nonprompt J /\u03c8.",

            "text": "The measured differential cross section for nonprompt J /\u03c8 is compared to a scaled pp reference based on FONLL calculations and is found to be consistent within uncertainties. The measured forward-backward ratios of cross sections in the range |y * | < 1.94 are consistent with unity within experimental uncertainties, and with no significant p T or y * dependence. No difference in these trends is observed between prompt and nonprompt J /\u03c8. These results differ from measurements at more forward y * and lower p T performed by the LHCb and ALICE collaborations [14,15]. This difference suggests a strong kinematic dependence of the cold-medium effects on both charmonium and b-quark production. These results constrain the kinematic dependence of QCD processes in the cold-medium that affect charmonium and b-quark production in p + Pb collisions, and provide a valuable reference for measurements of charmonium and open heavy flavor in Pb + Pb collisions.",
