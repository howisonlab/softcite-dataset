In R-parity-conserving supersymmetric models [11], supersymmetric partners are produced in pairs, and the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) is stable. The LSP could provide a viable candidate for dark matter [12,13]. The scalar partners of right-handed and left-handed quarks, theq R andq L squarks, can mix to form two mass eigenstates,q 1 andq 2 , withq 1 defined to be the lighter state. The charginos and neutralinos are mixtures of the binos, winos and Higgsinos that are the supersymmetric partners of the U(1) Y and SU(2) L gauge bosons and the Higgs bosons, respectively. Their mass eigenstates are referred to as\u03c7 \u00b1 i (i = 1, 2) and\u03c7 0 j (j = 1, 2, 3, 4) in order of increasing masses. In the present work, the LSP is assumed to be the lightest neutralino\u03c7 0 1 .",

The present analysis considers top-squark pair production with subsequent decays induced by flavour-violating effects into a charm quark and a LSP,t 1 \u2192 c\u03c7 0 1 , as indicated in the left panel of figure 1. This results in final-state signatures characterised by the presence of two charm quarks and missing transverse momentum from the LSPs which escape the detector. The magnitude of flavour-violating effects inducingt 1 \u2192 c\u03c7 0 1 decays is model dependent, and in certain cases the branching ratio of thet 1 \u2192 c\u03c7 0 1 decay can exceed the branching ratios of the three-and four-body decays (t 1 \u2192 W b\u03c7 0 1 andt 1 \u2192 bff \u03c7 0 1 , respectively, where f and f are two fermions from the virtual W boson decay). This can occur due to significant mixing between the top squark and the charm squark, which may be induced by renormalisation group equations even if minimal flavour violation is assumed at a certain scale [18].",

            "text": "In generic supersymmetric models, squarks are not required to be mass degenerate, and in particular, charm squarks could be considerably lighter than other squark flavours [19]. This motivates searches for pair production of charm squarks, each of which decays as c 1 \u2192 c\u03c7 0 1 , as illustrated in the right panel of figure 1. The experimental signature and the cross-section of such models are identical to those of top-squark production with the top squark decaying ast 1 \u2192 c\u03c7 0 1 and, therefore, the two processes are treated on the same footing in this analysis. For both processes, a 100% branching ratio to c\u03c7 0 1 is assumed. This paper presents a search for pair production of top and charm squarks decaying into a charm quark and the lightest neutralino, using 36.1 fb \u22121 of proton-proton (pp) collisions data at a centre-of-mass energy of \u221a s = 13 TeV collected by the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in 2015 and 2016. A dedicated algorithm is used to identify jets containing charm hadrons (c-jets). The search improves on previous results [20,21] from the ATLAS Collaboration using 20.3 fb \u22121 of 8 TeV data. A related search was recently reported by the CMS Collaboration [22].",

The inner tracking detector covers the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 2.5. It consists of silicon pixel, silicon microstrip, and transition-radiation tracking detectors. The newly installed innermost layer of pixel sensors [24] was operational for the first time during the 2015 data-taking, leading to an improvement of the flavour-tagging performance [25]. Lead/liquid-argon (LAr) sampling calorimeters provide electromagnetic (EM) energy measurements with high granularity. A hadron (steel/scintillator-tile) calorimeter covers the central pseudorapidity range (|\u03b7| < 1.7). The endcap and forward regions are instrumented with LAr calorimeters for both the EM and hadronic energy measurements up to |\u03b7| = 4.9. The muon spectrometer surrounds the calorimeters and is based on three large air-core toroidal superconducting magnets with eight coils each. The field integral of the toroids ranges between 2.0 and 6.0 Tm across most of the detector. The muon spectrometer includes a system of precision tracking chambers and fast detectors for triggering. A two-level trigger system [26] is used to select events. The first-level trigger is implemented in hardware and uses a subset of the detector information to reduce the accepted rate to at most 100 kHz. This is followed by a software-based trigger level that reduces the accepted event rate to about 1 kHz.",

The uncertainty in the combined 2015+2016 integrated luminosity is 2.1%. It is derived, following a methodology similar to that detailed in ref. [27], from a calibration of the luminosity scale using x\u2212y beam-separation scans performed in August 2015 and May 2016. On average, there are about 14 or 25 inelastic pp collisions (\"pile-up\") in each bunch crossing in the 2015 and 2016 datasets, respectively.",

Events containing W or Z bosons with associated jets, and diboson events (W W, W Z and ZZ) were simulated using the Sherpa 2.2.1 [37] event generator. The ME calculation is performed using Comix [38] and OpenLoops [39] for up to two partons at NLO and four partons at LO in W /Z + jets events and up to one parton at NLO and three partons at LO in diboson events, and merged with the Sherpa parton shower [40] according to the ME+PS@NLO prescription [41]. The NNPDF3.0NNLO PDF set [42] was used in conjunction with dedicated parton shower tuning developed by the Sherpa authors. The W /Z + jets events were normalised with NNLO QCD crosssections [43]. For the generation of tt events, Powheg-Box v2 [44] was used with the CT10 PDF [45] set in the matrix element calculations. Electroweak t-channel, s-channel and W t-channel single-top-quark events were generated with Powheg-Box v1. For schannel and W t-channel production, the CT10 PDF set was used, while for the t-channel production the four-flavour scheme was used for the NLO matrix element calculations together with the fixed four-flavour PDF set CT10f4. For tt and single-top-quark processes, top-quark spin correlations were preserved. The parton shower, hadronisation, and the underlying event were simulated using Pythia 6.428 [46] with the CTEQ6L1 PDF set and the corresponding Perugia 2012 set of tuned parameters [47]. The top-quark mass was set to 172.5 GeV. At least one leptonically decaying W boson was required in all generated tt and single-top-quark events. Fully hadronic decays do not produce sufficient E miss T to significantly contribute to the background.",

Two multivariate discriminants, MV2c100 and MV2cl100, are used to distinguish between c-jets and jets containing bottom hadrons (b-jets), and between c-jets and light-flavour jets (jets not containing a bor a c-hadron), respectively. The discriminants are based on the MV2 algorithm presented in refs. [25,61]. MV2c100 is trained with b-jets as signal and with background consisting exclusively of c-jets. MV2cl100 is trained with c-jets as signal and with background consisting exclusively of light-flavour jets. A \"tight\" working point was adopted in the analysis, resulting in a charm-tagging efficiency of about 18%, a b-jet rejection factor of 20, a lightflavour jet rejection factor of 200, and a hadronic \u03c4 jet rejection factor of 6, as evaluated in a sample of simulated tt events. The c-jet tagging rate is measured using a data sample rich in tt events, identifying c-jets from W boson decays. Correction factors dependent on the jet p T are derived to match the tagging rate in the simulation to that measured in data. They are found to range from 0.83 to 0.88 in Pythia 8 MC samples. Similarly, correction factors for the mis-tag rate for b-jets are derived using dileptonic tt data events. They are found to range from 0.81 to 0.97 in Pythia 8 MC samples. Correction factors for the mis-tag rate for light-flavour jets are instead evaluated by comparing the MC simulation to an \"adjusted\" simulation where the track-based variables used in the flavour-tagging evaluation, e.g. the transverse impact parameter relative to the primary vertex, are scaled to match the data.

For even smaller values of \u2206m, neither cjet is expected to be reconstructed. Another analysis, the \"monojet\" analysis described in ref. [64], is sensitive to this type of signal. Signal region SR2 targets compressed mass scenarios with \u2206m larger than 50 GeV but smaller than \u223c100 GeV. Both c-jets are expected to be reconstructed and at least three jets are required.
