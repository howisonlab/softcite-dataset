Ultimately, 4 selecting a direct photon as the trigger particle would provide the optimum choice since 5 the direct photon sets the reference of the 2 \u2192 2 type of hard scattering kinematics 6 and balances the jet emitted in the opposite azimuthal direction. In addition, while 7 purely hadronic observables are strongly biased with respect to surface emission, photons 8 can sample the entire collision volume.

Such a measurement requires to reconstruct charged tracks and identify neutral particles with good momentum/energy resolution. In ALICE, the electromagnetic calorimeters, PHOS (|\u2206\u03b7| < 0.12 and \u2206\u03c6 =100 o ) and EMCAL (|\u2206\u03b7| < 0.7 and \u2206\u03c6 =100 o ), allow us to measure and identify photons and neutral mesons with high efficiency and resolution.
