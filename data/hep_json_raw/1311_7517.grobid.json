The measured effective form factor is shown in Fig. 1 in comparison with existing e + e \u2212 and pp data. Our data are in reasonable agreement with previous measurements everywhere except near-threshold region, where the BABAR results are systematically larger than the PS170 data. 2 The measured mass dependence of the ratio |G E /G M | is shown in Figure 2. To measure the ratio the distribution of cos \u03b8 p is analyzed, where \u03b8 p is the angle between the proton momentum in the pp rest frame and the momentum of the pp system in the e + e \u2212 c.m. frame. The measured ratio is higher than unity at masses below 2.2 GeV/c 2 . Our results disagree with the previous PS170 measurement. 2 We have also searched for an asymmetry in the proton angular distribution. An asymmetry is absent in the lowest order (one-photon pp production). It arises from higher-order contributions (soft extra ISR and FSR interference, two-photon exchange). The integral asymmetry for events with pp mass below 3 GeV/c 2 is found to be consistent with zero:",
