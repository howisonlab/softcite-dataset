The study uses a collider detector at Fermilab Run II data sample corresponding to 2:65 fb \u00c01 of integrated luminosity. The data are in agreement with the standard model. In an R-parity conserving minimal supersymmetric scenario, and assuming that the sbottom decays exclusively into a bottom quark and a neutralino, 95% confidence-level upper limits on the sbottom pair production cross section of 0.1 pb are obtained. For neutralino masses below 70 GeV=c 2 , sbottom masses up to 230 GeV=c 2 are excluded at 95% confidence level.",

            "text": "Supersymmetry (SUSY) [1] is an extension of the standard model (SM) that naturally solves the hierarchy problem [2] and provides a possible candidate for dark matter in the Universe. SUSY doubles the SM spectrum of particles by introducing a new supersymmetric partner (sparticle) for each particle in the SM. In a generic minimal supersymmetric extension of the SM (MSSM) and assuming R-parity conservation [1], sparticles are produced in pairs, and the lightest supersymmetric particle is stable and identified as the neutralino 0 1 . Assuming a SUSY particle mass hierarchy such that the scalar bottom quark (sbottom)b 1 decays exclusively asb 1 ! b 0 1 , the expected signal for direct sbottom pair production is characterized by the presence of two energetic jets from the hadronization of the bottom quarks and large missing transverse energy E 6 T [3] from the two lightest supersymmetric particles in the final state. Results on searches in this channel using Tevatron data have been previously reported by both the collider detector at Fermilab (CDF) and D0 experiments in Run II [4][5][6]. This Letter presents new results based on an almost 10 times larger data sample collected by the CDF experiment, corresponding to 2:65 fb \u00c01 of total luminosity.",

The data are collected using a three-level trigger system that selects events with at least one calorimeter cluster with E T above 100 GeV. The events are then required to have a primary vertex with a z position within 60 cm of the nominal interaction point. Jets are reconstructed from the energy deposits in the calorimeter towers using a conebased algorithm [8] with cone radius R \u00bc ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi ffi \u00c1 2 \u00fe \u00c1 2 p \u00bc 0:4, and the measured E jet T is corrected for detector effects and contributions from multiple p \" p interactions per crossing at high instantaneous luminosity, as discussed in Ref. [9]. The events are initially selected with E 6 T > 10 GeV and two jets with transverse energy E jet T > 25 GeV and pseudorapidity j jet j < 2:0, where at least one of the two jets is required to have j jet j < 1:1. Events with additional jets with E jet T > 15 GeV and j jet j < 2:8 are rejected. The effect of the trigger selection is studied using control data samples and parametrized as a function of E 6 T and the transverse energy of the leading jet E jet\u00f01\u00de T [10]. At a given E 6 T , the trigger efficiency increases with increasing E jet\u00f01\u00de T . Finally, at least one of the two leading jets is required to originate from a b-quark jet candidate, using the default CDF b-jet tagging algorithm (SECVTX) [11], based on the presence of a displaced vertex due to the decay of a b hadron inside the jet.",

            "text": "A detailed study of systematic uncertainties was carried out [10]. The uncertainty on the SM background predictions is dominated by the determination of the b-jet mistag rates, which propagates into an uncertainty in the SM prediction between 13% and 11% as \u00c1M increases. The uncertainty on the k HF value applied to the boson plus jets heavy-flavor samples translates into an 11% uncertainty in the SM predictions. The dependence on the amount of initial-state and final-state radiation in the Monte Carlo generated samples for top, boson plus jets, and diboson contributions introduces a 6% uncertainty on the SM predictions. Other sources of uncertainty on the predicted SM background are: a 3% uncertainty due to the determination of the b-tagging efficiency in the Monte Carlo simulated samples; a 3% uncertainty from the uncertainties on the absolute normalization of the top quark, diboson, W, and Z Monte Carlo generated processes; and a 2.5% uncertainty from the knowledge of the jet energy scale [9]. In addition, uncertainties related to trigger efficiency and the heavyflavor QCD multijet background contribute less than 1% to the final uncertainty. The total systematic uncertainty on the SM predictions varies between 19% and 18% as \u00c1M increases. In the case of the MSSM signal, various sources of uncertainty on the predicted cross sections at NLO, as determined using PROSPINO2, are considered: the uncertainty due to PDFs is computed using the Hessian method [25] and translates into a 12% uncertainty on the absolute predictions; variations of the renormalization and factorization scale by a factor of 2 change the theoretical cross sections by about 26%. Uncertainties on the amount of initial-and final-state gluon radiation in the MSSM Monte Carlo generated samples introduce a 10% uncertainty on the signal yields. The 3% uncertainty on the absolute jet energy scale translates into a 9% to 14% uncertainty on the MSSM predictions. Other sources of uncertainty include: a 4% uncertainty due to the determination of the b-tagging efficiency, and a 2% to 1% uncertainty due to the uncertainty on the trigger efficiency. The total systematic uncertainty on the MSSM signal yields varies between 30% and 32% as \u00c1M increases. Finally, an additional 6% uncertainty on the quoted total integrated luminosity is also taken into account in both SM and SUSY predictions.",

For the latter, correlations between systematic uncertainties on signal efficiencies and background predictions are taken into account. For each MSSM point considered, observed and expected limits are computed separately for both low-and high-\u00c1M analyses, and the one with the best expected limit is adopted as the nominal result. Cross sections above 0.1 pb are excluded at 95% C.L. for the range of sbottom masses considered. Similarly, the observed numbers of events in data are translated into 95% C.L. upper limits for sbottom and neutralino masses, for which the uncertainties on the theoretical cross sections are also included in the limit calculation, and where both analyses are combined in the same way as for the cross section limits. Figure 2 shows the expected and observed exclusion regions in the sbottomneutralino mass plane. For the MSSM scenario considered, sbottom masses up to 230 GeV=c 2 are excluded at 95% C.L. for neutralino masses below 70 GeV=c 2 . This analysis extends the previous CDF limits [4] on the sbottom mass by more than 40 GeV=c 2 .",
