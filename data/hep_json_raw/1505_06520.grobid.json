The measurements are based on data collected with the CMS detector at \u221a s = 8 TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb \u22121 . The differential cross sections and their ratios are presented as functions of p T . The measurements are also shown as functions of the jet multiplicity. Differential cross sections are obtained as functions of the ratio of the Z/\u03b3 * p T to the sum of all jet transverse momenta and of the ratio of the Z/\u03b3 * p T to the leading jet transverse momentum. The data are corrected for detector effects and are compared to simulations based on several QCD calculations.",

Precise measurements of these processes provide important tests of the Standard Model (SM) as well as crucial inputs in the determination of parton densities in the proton [8]. Such measurements can improve the validation and tuning of the models used in Monte Carlo (MC) simulation. These processes are also important backgrounds in searches for new physics.",

The dielectron mass resolution for Z \u2192 ee decays when both electrons are in the ECAL barrel is 1.8%, and is 2.7% when both electrons are in the endcaps. The electron momenta are estimated by combining energy measurements in the ECAL with momentum measurements in the tracker [14]. Muons are measured in the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 2.4, with detection planes made using three technologies: drift tubes, cathode strip chambers, and resistive-plate chambers. Matching muons to tracks measured in the silicon tracker results in a relative transverse momentum resolution for muons with < p T < 100 GeV of 1.3-2.0% in the barrel and better than 6% in the endcap.

Depending on their signatures in the various subdetectors, particles fall into five different PF categories: muons, electrons, photons, neutral hadrons, and charged hadrons. The lepton candidates are required to be isolated from the other particles in the event, so to evaluate the isolation a scalar p T sum of PF objects is calculated in the cone \u2206R = \u221a (\u2206\u03c6) 2 + (\u2206\u03b7) 2 around the direction of the object. The contribution from pileup to this isolation scalar p T sum is subtracted using the average pileup energy per unit area in the \u03b7-\u03c6 plane evaluated for each event [36]. For electrons, the pileupsubtracted isolation sum is calculated in a cone of \u2206R = 0.3 around the direction of the electron and is required to be below 15% of the electron p T . For muons, the radius is set to be \u2206R = 0.4 and the isolation variable is required to be less than 12% of the muon p T . Lepton reconstruction, identification, and isolation efficiencies are measured using the \"tag-and-probe\" technique as described in ref. [37].

            "text": "The photons are reconstructed offline from energy clusters in ECAL [13]. Events for the \u03b3 + jets processes are selected at the trigger level, where the presence of a high-p T photon candidate is required. Since the instantaneous luminosity of the LHC increased during the data-taking period, the threshold in p T increased as well, and the lower p T threshold triggers are prescaled in order to keep the rate at a reasonable level. An unprescaled trigger is available only for a photon with transverse momentum p \u03b3 T > 207 GeV. In order to further reduce the rate, a loose shower shape cutoff \u03c3 \u03b7\u03b7 < 0.24 is imposed at trigger level, where \u03c3 \u03b7\u03b7 measures the extension of the shower in pseudorapidity in terms of the energy-weighted spread within the 5\u00d75 crystal matrix around the most energetic crystal in the photon cluster. For photon candidates, a match with a corresponding trigger object is required. For this analysis, only isolated high-p T photons located inside the barrel region of the detector (|\u03b7| < 1.4) are considered. We concentrate on photons inside the barrel region because the data size of the templates, described in section 5.2, allows for a precise purity determination in this region. Around 40% of the photons convert into e + e \u2212 pairs inside the tracker material. Conversion track candidates are fitted from a combination of ECAL seeded tracks and Gaussian sum filter [38] electron tracks originate from a common vertex. The track pair is then matched to energy clusters in ECAL to identify a converted photon candidate. The final photon candidates are checked for possible overlap with electron candidates by looking for electron track seeds in the pixel detector or by using the characteristics of the track pair for converted photons. Isolation requirements are separately imposed on the pileupcorrected scalar p T sum of neutral and charged hadrons, as well as on additional photons inside a cone of \u2206R = 0.3 around the photon candidate direction. MC over data scale factors for the selection efficiencies of unconverted and converted photons without the electron veto are measured using the tag-and-probe technique on Z \u2192 e + e \u2212 events; the scale factors for the electron veto efficiency on signal photons are determined using Z \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 \u03b3 candidates. These scale factors range between 0.96 and 1.01 for photon candidates with p \u03b3 T > 40 GeV. Jets are reconstructed from the four-momentum vectors of all PF objects. The antik T clustering algorithm [39] is used here with a distance parameter of R = 0.5 in its FastJet [40] implementation. The jets are clustered by four-momentum summation. The reconstructed PF candidates are calibrated separately to account for the nonlinear and nonuniform response of the CMS hadron calorimeter, especially for neutral hadrons. Charged hadrons and photons are well measured in the silicon tracker and the ECAL, and therefore need only minimal corrections. Thus, the resulting jets require only small additional momentum adjustments. Jet energy corrections are obtained using Geant4 simulated events generated with pythia6. The energy contributions due to the presence of additional proton-proton interactions are subtracted from each jet using the measured pileup unit density in the event and the jet area [36]. The \u03b7 dependent corrections are adjusted using exclusive dijet events, while the p T -dependent corrections are adjusted using exclusive Z + 1-jet and \u03b3 + 1-jet events in the data [41]. As a result of these adjustments, the reconstructed jets are corrected to the stable particle level [42]. For PF jets, the jet energy correction factor typically ranges from 1 to 1.2. Jets originating from pileup are rejected using the criteria described in ref. [43]. This rejects 90-95% of pure pileup jets while keeping over 99% of jets from the primary interaction. Jet identification quality re-JHEP10 (2015)128quirements are imposed in order to remove spurious jets caused by noise in the calorimeter. The remaining jets are accepted for the analysis if they satisfy p T > 30 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.4. Additionally, jets within a radius of \u2206R < 0.5 with respect to the axes of each lepton or photon candidate are removed. This cut affects a small number of jets. For both Z + jets and \u03b3 + jets selections, the presence of at least one jet is required.",

As a second check, the relative rate of e\u00b5 events in data and MC are compared to those of dielectron or dimuon events as a function of the dilepton p T .

The rate of the combined EW backgrounds predicted by simulation in a control region of multilepton final states is checked with data in the following way. Instead of selecting the two leading leptons, and then enforcing the same flavor requirement, we instead select the first two leptons matching the trigger objects with the same flavor. The rate of events gained with respect to the baseline selection is largely dominated by diboson events.

The main background is due to QCD multijet production, where either one of the jets, or an electron or \u03c0 0 inside a jet, is misidentified as a photon candidate. Since simulations do not provide a reliable description of this background, the purity, which is defined as the number of true isolated photons from the hard scattering versus the number of all photon candidates, is determined from data. At the particle level, a true isolated photon is defined as a prompt photon, around which the scalar sum of the p T of all stable particles in a cone of radius \u2206R = 0.4 is less than 5 GeV. Similarly, at the detector level, for each p T bin of the photon spectrum, the purity is determined through a fit of the photon isolation sum variable I PF ph , defined as the scalar p T sum of all other PF photons around the axis of the selected photon candidate, inside a cone of \u2206R = 0.4. The sum is corrected for the pileup contribution and the energy deposit (\"footprint\") of the selected photon candidate itself.

In order to model the contribution of the underlying event to the photon component isolation sum around the signal photon candidate, a signal template is obtained from the data through the random-cone (RC) method [47]. After selecting photon candidates fulfilling a requirement on the shower shape of \u03c3 \u03b7\u03b7 < 0.011, a cone of \u2206R = 0.4 is randomly chosen in \u03c6 at the same \u03b7 as the photon candidate, excluding the back-to-back direction to avoid selecting any recoiling jet. The candidate cone is rejected if it contains objects originating from a hard interaction, e.g., jets with p T > 30 GeV or photons with p T > 20 GeV. The RC templates show a very good agreement over orders of magnitude between data, simulation, and the true-photon MC templates obtained by matching a detector-level photon candidate with an isolated photon at the particle level. Background templates are constructed by selecting photon candidates in the data with an inverted shower shape requirement, 0.011 < \u03c3 \u03b7\u03b7 < 0.014. Since there are a small number of background events with high p T photon candidates, the templates are obtained in wider bins of p \u03b3 T than used in the final analysis. After construction of the templates, a binned maximum-likelihood fit to the I PF ph data distributions is performed as a sum of the signal and background template distributions. The statistical uncertainty on the fit includes the effect of the limited template sample size. An example of the fit for the photon component of the photon isolation can be seen in figure 1 (left). The results of such fits are displayed in figure 1 (right), where the black dots represent the measured purity and the solid lines represent the statistical uncertainties including the template uncertainties. The purity ranges from around 65% in the lower p T bins to 90% at high p T . The shaded band represents the total statistical and systematic uncertainties in the purity measurement. The difference in the fractions obtained from the closure test on simulation is treated as JHEP10 2015  the systematic uncertainty. True MC signal (background) templates are determined using identified photons at detector level matched (not matched) to a particle-level photon. The closure test uses the same approach for deriving templates that was used in data: it takes simulated samples and compares the resulting templates of the data-driven approach with the templates constructed exploiting the MC-truth information. This is the dominant source of systematic uncertainty in the purity estimate. Other effects, such as a change in the \u03c3 \u03b7\u03b7 requirement, are found to be negligible. The systematic uncertainties of the purity estimate are discussed further in section 6. The data yields in each p T bin, after correcting for purity, are unfolded to the particle level with a procedure identical to the one used for the Z + jets process. Over the whole p \u03b3 T spectrum, the diagonal elements of the response matrix contain more than 90% of the events.",

Most uncertainties in these distributions are similar to those described above for the p Z T spectra, with the exception of the JES uncertainty.

This is a result of the difference between the shapes of the templates defined using the data-driven -11 -JHEP10 2015 techniques from above and the distributions of the \"true\" templates for isolated photons in simulated events. Data samples are generated using the distributions of isolation variables for every bin of each variable with the fractions measured in data. Each of these is fitted with templates built in MC using the same techniques as on data, and the average difference between these fitted fractions and the generated fractions is quoted as the systematic uncertainty due to photon purity estimation [47]. This difference is around 10% when p \u03b3 T \u2248 100 GeV and it decreases to roughly 4% at p \u03b3 T \u2248 400 GeV for the inclusive n jets \u2265 1 selection. A change in the selection criteria on \u03c3 \u03b7\u03b7 leads to negligible effects on the purity estimation. The background templates do not show any dependence on H T or on the number of jets in the analysis. Therefore, the same background templates of the inclusive selection are used for all phase space regions and a similar template uncertainty is obtained.",

Events that populate the high-end tail of the distribution have either additional jets outside of the acceptance in the forward region or additional hadronic radiation that is not clustered in jets with p jet T > 30 GeV. In hadronic searches for new physics, these events contribute to signatures with a high E T / /H T ratio. Almost all events with two or more jets inside the jet acceptance selections have p Z T /H T values below one. This behavior can be observed in figure 5: increasing the number of required jets leads to a shift of the complete distribution towards lower values. The nonperturbative corrections are slightly larger, typically below 5% in the bulk of the distribution, reaching 10% in the tails for all variables examined here. Overall, MadGraph+pythia6 predicts the rate and shape best up to the tails, while sherpa shows differences in both shape and rates. The BlackHat generator performs well for the bulk of the distribution, but fails to reproduce the tails. This is especially evident in the high-end tail of the distribution, where we see a sharp drop in the ratio of BlackHat simulations to data. In this portion of phase space, BlackHat is effectively reduced from an NLO to LO calculation as the n+1 jet LO calculation in the inclusive n jet case dominates here, whereas the other portions provide negligible contributions. This feature is also confirmed by the sharp increase of scale uncertainties in BlackHat estimates, which have a step-like increase from below 10% to around 60% at this point. Therefore, this sharp change in the BlackHat over data ratio (e.g., around 1.2 and 1.1 in figure 5) is expected and indicates the \"boundary\" between the regions where a fixed-order calculation gives a suitable estimation and where we would need the parton showering to add soft jets or jets in the forward regions of the detector. Additionally, we can use this to check for any large logarithmic contributions in the lower end of this p Z T /H T distribution. We see from the agreement in both the 2-and 3-jet cases that there is no evidence of any such contributions.",

If we correlate the different renormalization and factorization scales (\u00b5 R and \u00b5 F ), the envelope decreases to approximately 2%, whereas if we take the scales as completely anticorrelated, we see a band of approximately 10% in the bulk. However, we know that the former underestimates the theoretical uncertainty due to renormalization and factorization scales, and the latter overestimates it. The estimation of this uncertainty has been discussed in the literature, and has been examined by comparing different theoretical computational estimations ([9] and [32]). Both of the previously mentioned methods misrepresent the actual uncertainty due to the renormalization and factorization scales. We therefore choose the larger relative scale uncertainty band from each process as an estimate of the uncertainty on the final ratio.
