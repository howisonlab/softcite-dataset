The yields of hadrons produced in the collisions are studied for indications of the onset of deconfinement (kink, horn and step) and the critical point of the phase transition (hill in event-by-event fluctuations). Recent measurements of Argon and Scandium collisions are an important step in this program. Comparison of negative pion spectra give important insight into the dynamics of ion collisions at the border of light and heavy nuclei.",
