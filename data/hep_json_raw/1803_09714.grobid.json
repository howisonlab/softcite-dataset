( P = \u03c0 0 , \u03b7, \u03b7 ) and a lepton ( = e, \u03bc), is of great interest for our understanding of both the intrinsic structure of hadrons and the fundamental mechanisms of the interactions between photons and hadrons [1]. These Dalitz decays proceed via a two-body radiative process of V decaying into P and an off-shell photon, from which the lepton pair in the final state originates. The universal decay width of these Dalitz decays can be normalized to that of the corresponding radiative process V \u2192 P \u03b3 and can be parameterized as a product of the quantum electrodynamics prediction for a point-like particle and the transition form factor (TFF) F (q 2 ) at the V -P transition vertex [1], where 2 is the fourmomentum transfer squared. Knowledge of the q 2 -dependent TFF thus provides information about the EM structure arising at the V -P vertex.",

The charmonium EM Dalitz decays J /\u03c8 \u2192 P e + e \u2212 have been previously observed by the BESIII experiment using a data sample of 2.25 \u00d7 10 8 J /\u03c8 events [9]. The results agree well with the theoretical predictions [8] for the P = \u03b7, \u03b7 cases. However, similar EM Dalitz decays have never been studied in \u03c8(3686) decays. The investigation of such processes will be important to understand the interaction of charmonium vector states with photons, and helpful for further studies on the \u03c8 \u2192 V P process, including the related \u03c1\u03c0 puzzle [10].
