This was performed by looking at both the muon and hadronic final state particles to create a double differential cross-section distribution that provides additional insight into the different regions of the phase-space where nuclear effects are present. We show early comparisons of the NEUT and NuWro generators in an attempt to estimate which parts of the models are in agreement with this data.",

            "text": "Lepton scattering cross-sections have been found to differ significantly for light (H, D) and heavy nuclear (C, O) targets in both electron and neutrino beam experiments [1]. These differences are caused by complex nuclear effects that vary with the target atomic number. Electron scattering experiments have found that a good seperation of these effects can be seen when measuring the cross-section in terms of the energy and three-momentum transfer (q 0 , q 3 ). Unfortunately, for neutrino scattering experiments it is difficult to directly measure q 0 and q 3 , since the incoming neutrino is not directly observed. In a recent study [2] the MINERvA collaboration has tried to obtain a similar separation of nuclear effects in neutrino scattering through the measurement of hadronic final states. They measure the total energy deposited by different final state particles in a charged-current-inclusive sample and use this to form the kinematic quantity E av ,\"Energy Available\", defined as",

            "text": "When comparing individual interaction channels we find the largest differences between the NuWro and NEUT generators are due to differences in their initial state models as expected. At low energy available and low three momentum transfer the events are dominated by purely proton/neutron final states. Here we see that the NEUT generator has a signficant deficit of events compared to NuWro, due to the exaggerated Pauli-blocking in the RFG model ( Figure 2). Unfortunately due to the difficulty in the direct tagging of low energy protons and the degeneracy in this region with other expected nuclear effects, multiple measurements will need to be made in future to place a good constraint on which spectral function best describes this region. At higher energies in the \"dip\" region ( Figure 3) there is a significant disagreement between the NEUT prediction and the data. This shape disagreement is found to be much smaller for the NuWro generator as the LFG model shifts the quasi-elastic peak to higher final state energies. Multiple cross-section channels compete here with the quasi-elastic and resonance peaks dominating, but since no direct measurement has been made on each of these channels exclusively in E av \u2212q 3 , it is hard to determine whether the tensions come from the mis-modelling of a single interaction channel or multiple channels.

The assumption that a single interaction channel is the cause of this tension builds on a larger assumption that the quasi-elastic and resonance channels are accurately modelled in the E av \u2212 q 3 phase space. The best way to use these measurements to produce reliable model constraints is through a global fit to multiple cross-section measurements where all free parameters in the model are varied.",
