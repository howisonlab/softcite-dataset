The analysis uses data from proton-proton collisions with an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 at \u221a s = 13 TeV collected with the CMS detector at the LHC. The observed limit on the Z \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03b3 decay branching fraction, assuming that the J/\u03c8 meson is produced unpolarized, is 1.4 \u00d7 10 \u22126 at 95% confidence level, which corresponds to a rate higher than expected in the standard model by a factor of 15. For extreme-polarization scenarios, the observed limit changes from \u221213.6 to +8.6% with respect to the unpolarized scenario. The observed upper limit on the branching fraction for H \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03b3 where the J/\u03c8 meson is assumed to be transversely polarized is 7.6 \u00d7 10 \u22124 , a factor of 260 larger than the standard model prediction. The results for the Higgs boson are combined with previous data from proton-proton collisions at \u221a s = 8 TeV to produce an observed upper limit on the branching fraction for H \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03b3 that is a factor of 220 larger than the standard model value.",

            "text": "A new boson with a mass of 125 GeV was observed in data from the ATLAS and CMS experiments at the CERN LHC [1][2][3][4][5][6][7]. All measurements of the properties of this boson are consistent with those of the Higgs boson (H) of the standard model (SM). However, the Yukawa couplings of the Higgs boson to the first-and second-generation quarks are currently only weakly constrained. Rare exclusive decays of the Higgs boson to mesons in association with a photon can be used to explore such couplings. For example, the H \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03b3 decay can probe the Higgs boson coupling to the charm quark [8]. The corresponding decay, Z \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03b3 , can be used as an experimental benchmark in the search for H \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03b3 [9,10], and in checking approaches to factorization in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) used to estimate e-mail: cms-publication-committee-chair@cern.ch branching fractions (B) in radiative decays of electroweak bosons [11].",

            "text": "Modified Hcc couplings can arise in certain extensions of the SM [14]. For example, within the context of effective field theory, the Hcc coupling may be modified in the presence of a dimension-six operator, leading to an enhancement of coupling relative to the SM at the cutoff scale that can be as small as 30 TeV. This provides no other signature of new physics at the LHC. In the two Higgs doublet model with minimal flavor violation [15,16], the Hcc coupling can be significantly enhanced by breaking flavor symmetry, while other couplings are not severely affected. The composite pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson model [17] parametrizes the coupling by the degree of compositeness and compositeness scale. The coupling can be constrained through a direct experimental search for the composite particles associated with the charm quark [18]. Deviations from SM predictions for the couplings can affect the interference terms and result in changes to the branching fractions. For example, the shift in the branching fraction for H \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03b3 can be more than 100% if the Hcc coupling deviates from its SM value by more than a factor of 2 [8]. Since this Higgs boson decay is sensitive to the Hcc coupling, a measurement of the branching fraction can verify whether the Higgs boson couples to second-generation quarks with the strength predicted by the SM. The ATLAS experiment has searched for the decay Z \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03b3 in proton-proton (pp) collisions collected at \u221a s = 8 TeV [19]. The respective observed and expected upper limits at 95% confidence level (CL) on the branching fraction were reported to be 2.6 and 2.0 +1.0 \u22120.6 \u00d7 10 \u22126 , where the subscript and superscript reflect the range in the 68% central-quantiles of upper limits assuming a backgroundonly hypothesis. Searches for the H \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03b3 decay were performed by ATLAS and CMS in pp collisions collected at \u221a s = 8 TeV [19,20]. The respective observed and expected upper limits in the branching fractions were 1.5 and 1.2 +0.6 \u22120.3 \u00d7 10 \u22123 from ATLAS, and 1.5 and 1.6 +0.8 \u22120.8 \u00d7 10 \u22123 from CMS. The ATLAS experiment performed similar searches for both the Z and Higgs boson decays in pp collisions collected at \u221a s = 13 TeV. The respective observed and expected upper limits on the branching fractions were 2.3 and 1.1 +0.5 \u22120.3 \u00d710 \u22126 for the Z boson decay, and 3.5 and 3.0 +1. 4 \u22120.8 \u00d7 10 \u22124 for the Higgs boson decay [21]. The ATLAS experiment also searched for the H \u2192 cc decay in pp \u2192 ZH production in data collected at \u221a s = 13 TeV [22], and reported observed and expected limits on the ratio \u03c3 (pp \u2192 ZH) \u00d7 B(H \u2192 cc) relative to the SM prediction of 110 and 150 +80 \u221240 respectively, where \u03c3 (pp \u2192 ZH) \u00d7 B(H \u2192 cc) is the upper limit for the cross section.",

The nominal results are obtained using a signal acceptance calculated for the unpolarized case. Assuming that the J/\u03c8 is produced with full transverse or longitudinal polarization (\u03bb \u03b8 = +1 or \u22121) changes the acceptance by \u22127.8% or +15.6%, respectively.

This process exhibits a peak at the Z boson mass, m Z , in the three-body invariant mass, m \u03bc\u03bc\u03b3 , as do the signal events, and it is therefore referred to as a resonant background.

Photons that do not convert to an e + e \u2212 pair in the detector tend to have high values of R 9 and a threshold of 0.94 is used to classify reconstructed photons with high R 9 (thus with a better resolution) and low R 9 (worse resolution). The three categories are: (1) photon in the barrel region with a high R 9 value (referred to as EB high R 9 ); (2) photon in the barrel region with low R 9 value (referred to as EB low R 9 ); and (3) photon in the endcap region (referred to as EE). The EE category is not divided into high/low R 9 because there are only a few events in this category. Events in the H \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03b3 search are not divided into categories since the sample size is limited and the sensitivity is still far from the SM prediction, and therefore event categorization does not result in a significant improvement in the expected limit.

The total signal efficiency for the Z boson decay is 13% if the J/\u03c8 meson is fully transversely polarized and 16% if it is fully longitudinally polarized. The difference between the efficiency for the Z boson and that for the Higgs boson arises from the differences in the p T spectra for the muons and the photon in the two cases. These differences are due to the difference between the Z boson and Higgs boson masses. Figures 4 and 5 show the dimuon invariant mass and photon E T distributions for both Z and Higgs boson searches with events from all categories included. The number of events in the distributions from signal events is set to 40 (750) times the SM predicted yield for the Z (H) boson decay. The number of events in distributions in the resonant background samples is normalized to 5 (150) times the expected yield. The peak at the J/\u03c8 mass in data shows that real J/\u03c8 candidates are reconstructed and selected. These events come from inclusive quarkonium production; no simulation is available for this analysis so they cannot be included in the distributions. The background from Z \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc\u03b3 events, for which a proper simulation exists, is much smaller than from inclusive quarkonium production, and it is scaled to make it visible. Figure 6 shows the distribution of the proper decay time t, defined as (m \u03bc\u03bc / p \u03bc\u03bc T )L xy , where L xy is the distance between the primary event vertex and the common vertex of the muons in the transverse plane, for both Z and Higgs boson decays. These distributions are normalized to the number of selected events in data. The negative values come from the fact that  T is smaller (larger) than \u03c0/2.

Pseudo-events are randomly generated by using the resulting fit as a background model to simulate possible experiment results. Here, the order of the background function required to describe the data for each of the families is determined by increasing the number of parameters until an additional increase does not result in a significant improvement in the quality of the fit to the observed data.

This procedure is repeated 5000 times and for each of the functions, and it is expected that ideally on average the signal strength predicted by the fit \u03bc fit will be equal to \u03bc gen . The deviation of the mean fitted signal strength \u03bc fit from \u03bc gen in pseudo-events is used to quantify the potential bias. The criterion for the bias to be negligible is that the deviation must be at least five times smaller than the statistical uncertainty on \u03bc fit . In other words, the distribution of the pull values, defined as (\u03bc fit \u2212 \u03bc gen )/\u03c3 fit , calculated from each pseudo-event should have a mean value of less than 0.2.

They are evaluated by varying contributing sources within their corresponding uncertainties and propagating the uncertainties to the signal yields or shapes in simulated signal samples. The sources of the uncertainties and their magnitudes are summarized in Table 2. The uncertainties are classified into two types, one affecting the predicted signal yields and the other affecting the shapes of the signal models. The first type includes the uncertainties in the luminosity measurement [57], the pileup modeling in the simulations, the cor-rections applied to the simulated events in order to compensate for differences in trigger, object reconstruction, and identification efficiencies, and the theoretical uncertainties. The theoretical uncertainties come from the effects of the PDF choice on the signal cross section [33,38,58], the lack of higher-order calculations for the cross-section [59][60][61][62][63], and the prediction of the decay branching fractions [64]. The second type arises from the uncertainties in the momentum (energy) scale and resolution for muons (photons). These uncertainties are incorporated into the signal models by varying the momentum (energy) scale and resolution and introducing the effects on the mean and width of the Gaussian component of the signal models as shape nuisance parameters in the estimation of the limits.",
