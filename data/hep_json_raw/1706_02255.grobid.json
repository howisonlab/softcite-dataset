This excess was observed at preselection level during data-MC comparisons of four-jet events when no search was being performed. The events are clustered into four jets and paired such that the mass difference between the two dijet systems is minimized. The excess occurs in the region M 1 +M 2 \u223c 110 GeV; about half of the excess is concentrated in the region M 1 \u223c 80 GeV, M 2 \u223c 25 GeV, with a local significance between 4.7\u03c3 and 5.5\u03c3, depending on assumptions about hadronization uncertainties. The other half of the events are in a broad excess near M 1 \u223c M 2 \u223c 55 GeV; these display a local significance of 4.1-4.5\u03c3. We investigate the effects of changing the SM QCD Monte Carlo sample, the jet-clustering algorithm, and the jet rescaling method. We find that the excess is remarkably robust under these changes, and we find no source of systematic uncertainty that can explain the excess. No analogue of the excess is seen at LEP1.",

This excess was observed during data-Monte Carlo (MC) comparisons at preselection level, when no analysis was being performed. The excess roughly decomposes into two regions with significances of 4.7-5.5\u03c3 and 4.1-4.5\u03c3, respectively.

As part of checking that our MC and basic code were functioning on hadronic states, 2 we forced events into four jets with a basic preselection. We paired the jets such as to minimize the difference in mass between the two dijet systems. Such a pairing is useful for searches for pair-production of hadronic resonances or studies of the W \u00b1 boson, and the sum of the two dijet masses M 1 + M 2 is generally more precise than either of the masses measured separately; such a plot also displays a nice separation of QCD and W + W \u2212 events, useful for data-MC comparisons.",

            "text": "Unlike what was typical during the LEP era, we plotted M 1 + M 2 using the entire ALEPH LEP2 data sample (\u223c 735pb \u22121 ) simultaneously; with our very loose cuts, this amounts to O(17, 000) events. In doing so, we noticed an excess of about 200 events (\u223c 3\u03c3) in the dijet mass sum in the region M 1 + M 2 \u223c 110 GeV. Interestingly, this is the same region in which ALEPH observed an excess in the search for hA final states [2] with a much smaller dataset (5.7pb \u22121 ) and after analysis cuts; the excess was later dismissed as a statistical fluctuation [3]. 3 This excess brought with it a set of unusual challenges. The first of these is that we had no model on which to base selection cuts for an analysis. Second, as this excess was found during data-MC comparisons at preselection level when no search was being conducted, 1 The ALEPH Archived Data Statement can be found at [1]. 2 Specifically, we were trying to make sure that we had correctly implemented the ALEPH b-tag code, and we wanted to compare the b-tag outputs to those in the four-jet channel of the ALEPH SM Higgs search results as a rudimentary check. 3 Our results, however, do not explain the previous ALEPH four-jet excess in the absence of a large statistical fluctuation. The average value for a pair-production cross-section relevant here is a factor of several smaller than those suggested by ref. [2]. Our results can accomodate a cross-section compatible with the number of events seen in that work at the relevant energies \u221a s = 130-136 GeV. However, it is important to note that the excess in ref. [2] persisted in the presence of tight cuts, unlike the very loose preselection applied here.",

Unfortunately, this is not possible in our case. However, there are three additional LEP data sets which could potentially be used to confirm or refute our findings. With this in mind, we follow the philosophy of ref. [2] and set about cataloging the features in the excess region to develop analyses which can be used by the three other LEP experiments. In this paper, we will concentrate on establishing the location of the excess, its significance, and its dependence upon MC samples, jet-clustering algorithm, etc. We will reserve further details, including distributions of many observables in the excess region, for future work.",

Additionally, the jet rescaling and initial-state radiation (ISR) rejection in the preselection were not optimal. As we needed to have the best QCD simulation possible, we tuned the SHERPA MC generator [8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16] as described in detail in ref. [17]. We adopted the LO SHERPA MC sample, reweighted using LEP1 data, as described in ref. [18], as this appeared to provide the most reliable simulation. We decided to use the LUCLUS [19] jetclustering algorithm following the conclusions of ref. [20] relating to new physics searches. Additionally, discrepancies observed during our initial data-MC comparisons using the KK2f MC and LUCLUS jet-clustering algorithm also spurred our initial investigations with SHERPA; such discrepancies were reduced by switching from KK2f to SHERPA for our QCD MC generation. We additionally made improvements to our jet rescaling and ISR rejection cuts.",

The local significance of this excess ranges from 4.7\u03c3 to 5.5\u03c3, depending on assumptions related to hadronization uncertainties. The rest of the excess in M 1 + M 2 \u223c 110 GeV clusters in a bump of significance 4.1\u03c3 to 4.5\u03c3 in the region M 1 \u223c 45 GeV, M 2 \u223c 60 GeV. This latter excess is rather wide and we study it under the hypothesis that it is centered at M 1 \u223c M 2 . We find that the events near M 1 \u223c 80 GeV, M 2 \u223c 25 GeV look very much like the SM QCD background; in particular, if the excess is interpreted as the production of an 80-GeV and a 25-GeV particle, the decay angle of the heavier object is sharply peaked near zero; this distribution is similar to that of the QCD background. Those events in the region near M 1 \u223c M 2 also resemble the QCD background but are naively more accommodating to hypotheses involving resonances. Thus, new-physics explanations for the excess may not be straightforward, and a single explanation may or may not cover both regions.",

Additionally, no analogue of the excess is seen at LEP1. These considerations make it reasonable to look beyond the SM for explanations for the excess. However, considering the similarities between the excess and the QCD background, particularly in the excess near M 1 \u223c 80 GeV, M 2 \u223c 25 GeV, one could still ask if improved modelling of SM QCD could somehow (or someday) explain the excess. We cannot readily address this question beyond the data-MC comparisons that we have done here, but we make the following comment. Even under the conservative assumption that this excess is due to imperfections in the modelling of QCD, understanding its origin is still important, and we will need MC generators which can simulate it.",

If the answer to this second inquiry is negative, new physics explanations will have to be considered. This paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we review our data and MC samples and our preselection. We give the results of using our nominal preselection, jet-clustering algorithm, and jet rescaling and our most reliable QCD MC sample in section 3. In  Table 1. Luminosities of data and MC generated at each LEP2 center-of-mass energy. Taken from ref.

Section 5 explores the effects of different jet-clustering algorithms, and section 6 similarly considers the effects of different methods for rescaling the jet energies. In section 7, we consider sources of systematic errors and give our final results. We discuss some additional systematic checks in section 8.

The purpose of this preselection is to retain hadronic events while removing the two-photon background and events with hard initial-state radiation. The cuts are as follows. We require the events to each contain at least 7 good charged tracks. We force the event into four jets; a discussion of the jet-clustering algorithms used will be given in sections 3 and 5. Each of these jets is required to have at least one good charged track. The sum of the jet transverse momenta p tsum must satisfy the relation p tsum > 25% \u221a s. The jets, with typical polar and azimuthal angular resolutions of 20 mrad, are then rescaled, keeping their directions fixed, such that their four-momenta sum to ( \u221a s, 0, 0, 0). Two different rescaling algorithms will be discussed in sections 3 and 6. Only events where all of the jet rescaling factors are positive are retained. For each jet we calculate the electromagnetic energy using energy flow objects corresponding to identified photons (including photon conversions), neutral particles passing through an electromagnetic calorimeter crack region and subsequently detected in the hadron calorimeter, and low angle particles (detected by the luminosity calorimeters). Events containing a jet where the electromagnetic energy in a one-degree cone around any electromagnetic energy flow object is more than 80% of the jet energy are rejected. Lastly, the visible mass m vis and the missing momentum in the beampipe direction p zmis must satisfy |p zmis | < 1.5(m vis \u2212 90). The number of data events and events expected from MC predictions after preselection cuts are taken from ref. [18] and are repeated here in table 2.",

Additionally, the three MC samples moved into better agreement at LEP2 when reweighted by multiplicative correction factors which bring them into agreement with data at LEP1. For this reason, it is expected that systematic errors will be smaller with the reweighted samples than with unreweighted samples.

Here, we rescale our jet four-momenta, keeping the jet directions and masses constant. This choice of fixed-mass rescaling is somewhat arbitrary and differs from the more common fixed-velocity jet rescaling used in, for example, refs. [34,35]. We will compare our results to those using fixed-velocity rescaling in section 6. 8 7 The Higgs analysis required events to have at least eight good tracks with | cos(\u03b8)| \u2264 0.95, required y34 > 0.004, and used only fixed-velocity jet rescaling. The fixed-velocity jet rescaling was replaced with a four-constraint fit in subsequent analyses [36]. 8 Events are required to have all jet rescaling factors positive. Events which fail this rescaling requirement with fixed-mass rescaling are then rescaled using fixed-velocity rescaling; for these events, if all rescaling factors are positive, the event is retained and fixed-velocity rescaling is used. The effect of this latter step is small; at \u221a s = 188.6 GeV, it increases the number of events in the LO SHERPA sample passing preselection by 0.34% and the number of four-fermion events passing by 1.8%.

The JADE algorithm shows decreased significance in Region B, and a slight shift to higher M 1 in Region A compared to LUCLUS. Finally, DICLUS shows a shift to higher M 1 and M 2 in Region A. It should be noted that the number of events passing preselection differs between the different algorithms. The algorithms with the greatest differences from LUCLUS in number of events passing preselection are DICLUS (\u223c 7% more than LUCLUS) and JADE (\u223c 6% fewer than LUCLUS). We repeat our fitting and toy MC generation procedure with samples which have been processed with these jet-clustering algorithms. We generate 1.15 \u00d7 10 8 toy MC events for each of the alternative algorithms. The results are given in four columns in table 5 and largely reflect the comments above. In the case of DICLUS in Region A, no toy MC experiments had a greater value of the test statistic than that of the data. We provide limits on the p-value and significance from the generated statistics as well as estimates of these quantities from extrapolating the log-likelihood distribution in table 5; if we had taken the naive values from the central value and width of the log-likelihood distribution, we would have obtained 6.1\u03c3 for the DICLUS algorithm in Region A.",

On the other hand, when DURHAM and LUCLUS agree well on the value of \u03a3, we see an excess similar to that for the entire 90% ellipse for each region. (Events in both of these selections have been required to pass both the LUCLUS and DURHAM preselections.) We also see that, relative to QCD events, the four-fermion events in both regions are more likely to satisfy |\u03a3 LUCLUS \u2212 \u03a3 DURHAM | < 5 GeV. As the four-fermion background has a greater tendency to have well-separated jets, this may be an indication that the excess events in Regions A and B have some characteristics that make them more \"four-jetty\" than would be expected from the QCD simulation. We also note two other features of comparing LUCLUS and DURHAM. First, from the numbers in table 6, we see that while requiring DURHAM and LUCLUS to approximately agree on the value of \u03a3 appears to enhance the excesses, the DURHAM preselection decreases the excess in Region B more than expected from the MC simulation. Second, enhancement of the excesses is not seen by demanding agreement between LUCLUS and DURHAM on \u2206 within 5 GeV; however, as the resolution on \u03a3 is typically better than that on \u2206, requiring agreement within 5 GeV may be too strict.",

We found that this was due to runs early in the 1994 dataset which had less accurate reported luminosities. As the number of hadronic events is of the same order of magnitude as the number of Bhabha events, we correct the LEP1 luminosity by using the total number of hadronic events in the 1994 dataset and the ratio of hadronic events to Bhabha events in the electroweak sample.

HERWIG and KK2f, however, generate the entire event using the parton shower, and it is reasonable to think that the systematic uncertainties inferred from a comparison of HERWIG and KK2f greatly overestimate any hadronization uncertainties relevant to our LO SHERPA samples. 15 Additionally, if we look at regions at LEP1 analogous to Regions 14 The values of these parameters in our KK2f MC are \u03c3 = 0.372, a = 0.5, and b = 0.894. Parameter values for our LO and NLO SHERPA samples can be found in ref. [17]. 15 We also do this exercise using the standard ALEPH tune for ARIADNE.

The parton shower in ARIADNE, however differs greatly from that of PYTHIA, so a comparison of ARIADNE and PYTHIA is more a measure of different parton showers than of different hadronization algorithms. Like HERWIG above, this is not directly comparable to our LO SHERPA samples, which use the four-, five-, and six-parton matrix elements.

To check for any systematic effects resulting from the detector, in figure 10, we plot cos(\u03b8 T ) and \u03c6 T , where \u03b8 T and \u03c6 T are the polar and azimuthal angles of the thrust axis, for the selected events in the 90% ellipse for each region.

In figure 11, we plot the missing energy for the selected events in Regions A and B, respectively; no indication of extra missing energy is seen.

Third, the QCD modelling was known to be imperfect, complicating interpretation of any disagreement with data. Techniques to reduce the SM QCD background, such as using cuts on thrust T or the Durham jet-resolution parameter y 34 , were used in a wide variety of analyses at LEP. The events in Region A are particularly sensitive to these efforts and would be largely eliminated by most analyses. While the excess in Region B is more resilient against these cuts, it is still adversely affected by attempts to reduce the QCD background. Additionally, even in Region B, the two dijets often have a substantial mass difference, and searches looking for equal-mass particles could miss many of the events. Also, some cuts, like requiring b-like jets for Higgs or technicolor searches, do not target or favor Regions A and B, but do reduce statistics. Lastly, searches for supersymmetric particles usually required events with missing energy; while there were searches for R-parity-violating SUSY, they typically involved leptons, missing energy, or more than four jets.",

Additionally, as mentioned in the Introduction, the results from the combined LEP search for charged Higgs bosons [21] may be an indication that the excess we observe in Region B may be lurking in the other LEP2 datasets. As in analyses mentioned above, the charged Higgs searches also used methods to substantially reduce the SM QCD background. The individual experiments had modest excesses at \u03a3 = 55 GeV, with CL b = 0.75, 0.96, 0.96, and 0.94, and a combined CL b = 0.997. It is possible that subtle differences in QCD rejection between the charged Higgs analyses and other analyses may make the charged Higgs analysis more sensitive to Region B events.

While statistical fluctuations certainly played a role in that result, our results suggest that they may have been helped by a small underlying systematic effect. One interesting feature of the events in that work was the suggestion of the production of unequal-mass particles, which naively is compatible with our observation of an excess narrowly peaked in \u03a3 but elongated in \u2206. We have checked that most, but not all, of the peak events observed in ref. [2] fall into our Region B; the difference is presumably due to the difference in jet-clustering algorithms used. 19 In summary, we see no results from the other LEP experiments which strongly disfavor the excesses we observe here, and we see several small excesses in places where they could plausibly be expected to appear. Certainly it is possible that the excesses we see in Regions A and B are also present in the other LEP datasets. We point out another possibility, however, with regard to Region B. The significance found for Region B when using the unreweighted KK2f sample as our QCD simulation was considerably higher than that for our nominal result. Thus, another possibility is that the excesses seen near Region B in the other experiments are due to inadequate QCD MC simulation, which may be correlated among the experiments, and that updating the MC samples, as we have done here, would eliminate them. Only with input from the other experiments can it be determined if either of these possibilities corresponds to reality.",

To do so, we recommend that jets be clustered with the LUCLUS algorithm, with perhaps repeating the analysis with DICLUS and DURHAM for comparison; we similarly suggest that results using fixed-mass and fixed-velocity jet rescaling be compared. We additionally suggest that experiments reproduce our nominal preselection as closely as possible, rejecting ISR and two-photon events while retaining QCD, although some detector-specific adjustments will likely have to be made. If generating improved MC is too onerous, the results of ref. [18] indicate that reweighting official MC using LEP1 data may be adequate, but this should be studied by the individual experiments. It should be noted, however, that MC reweighting of M 1 and M 2 is unlikely to correct the distributions of other variables of interest; their study likely requires full MC generation.",

In particular, improvements in MC generators in the last fifteen years make more precise comparisons of data and simulation possible, especially for hadronic final states. We therefore suggest revisiting the LEP data, with the help of modern MC generators, to look for signals which may have just eluded detection. Of course, the best option would be to acquire more data, as we hope will occur at future lepton colliders. Additionally, KK2f describes the variables sensitive to hard photons (such as the minimum jet charged track multiplicity and the maximum jet electromagnetic energy fraction) much better than SHERPA at LEP1. We thus believe that the modelling of FSR with KK2f is more accurate than that in the SHERPA samples. We correct the efficiencies of the anti-ISR cuts on the SHERPA samples to agree with those of the KK2f sample; we do this separately for LEP1 and for LEP2. These corrections are calculated using the LO SHERPA samples; as we expect the NLO to behave similarly, we use the same correction factors for those samples as well. Additionally, we compare our KK2f samples to the official ALEPH KK2f samples at LEP1. While our samples have FSR photons generated by KK2f and contain ISR-FSR interference, the official KK2f samples have FSR generated in the parton shower by PYTHIA, with no ISR-FSR interference. At LEP1, interference between ISR and FSR is negligible, so comparing our KK2f samples used here with the official KK2f samples provides a comparison of the simulation of FSR photons using the matrix element in KK2f with that generated using the PYTHIA parton shower. At LEP1, 20 we find a mild improvement in agreement with data for the electromagnetic jet fraction when using PYTHIA to simulate the FSR photons and also expect this improvement to persist at LEP2. We thus correct the efficiency of our charged track requirement for all of our LEP1 MC samples to the efficiency found for the official ALEPH KK2f sample.",

While there is no way to include ISR-FSR interference at LEP2 while having PYTHIA simulate the FSR JHEP10(2018)116 photons, we are able to generate samples where KK2f generates ISR and FSR photons, but interference is switched off. We generate such samples and compare them with official ALEPH samples where KK2f simulates ISR, but FSR is generated in the PYTHIA parton shower. This allows us to calculate a correction factor for the efficiency of the anti-photon cuts when changing the simulation of FSR photons from KK2f to PYTHIA. This correction factor can then be applied to our KK2f samples which have ISR-FSR interference included. We then subsequently correct our LO SHERPA sample to have the same efficiency for the anti-photon cuts as our corrected KK2f efficiency. As we expect the simulation of FSR photons in SHERPA to be similar for the LO and NLO samples, we apply this same correction factor to both.",

However, they do not include any uncertainty on the efficiency arising from any inaccuracies in the simulation of FSR in PYTHIA. To address this final point, we compare KK2f samples where ISR is generated by KK2f, but FSR, showering, and hadronization are simulated by a) PYTHIA, b) HERWIG, and c) ARIADNE. The HERWIG-and ARIADNE-showered samples are described in our summary of hadronization studies. From the difference in these samples, we assign an additional uncertainty of 0.035% on all QCD samples at LEP1 and 0.35% on all QCD samples at LEP2, where it is assumed that the error is correlated between the LO and NLO SHERPA and KK2f samples.

An additional estimate of the local significance can be obtained[41] from 2\u03bb(data). For our nominal result, this yields estimates of 5.49\u03c3 and 4.14\u03c3 for Regions A and B, respectively. We have also run toy MC experiments, in the background-only hypothesis, where we hold the positions and widths of the two gaussian peaks at the values obtained from the nominal fit, but fit the amplitudes of the two peaks. In the background-only hypothesis, the distributions of numbers of events fitted in the peaks are closely approximated by gaussians with mean zero and widths 22.5 (Region A) and 35.3 (Region B).",
