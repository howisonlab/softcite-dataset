The fractions of diffractive processes in inelastic collisions were determined from a study of gaps in charged particle pseudorapidity distributions: for single diffraction (diffractive mass +0.07   \u22120.08 , and 0.20 +0.04   \u22120.07 , respectively at centre-of-mass energies \u221a s = 0.9, 2.76, and 7 TeV; for double diffraction (for a pseudorapidity gap \u03b7 > 3) \u03c3 DD /\u03c3 INEL = 0.11 \u00b1 0.03, 0.12 \u00b1 0.05, and 0.12 +0.05 \u22120.04 , respectively at \u221a s = 0.9, 2.76, and 7 TeV. To measure the inelastic cross section, beam properties were determined with van der Meer scans, and, using a simulation of diffraction adjusted to data, the following values were obtained: \u03c3 INEL = 62.8 +2.4   \u22124.0 (model) \u00b1 1.2(lumi) mb at \u221a s = 2.76 TeV and 73.2 +2.0 \u22124.6 (model) \u00b1 2.6(lumi) mb at \u221a s = 7 TeV. The single-and double-diffractive cross sections were calculated combining relative rates of diffraction with inelastic cross sections. The results are compared to previous measurements at proton-antiproton and protonproton colliders at lower energies, to measurements by other experiments at the LHC, and to theoretical models.",

            "text": "The cross sections of inelastic and diffractive processes in proton-proton (pp) collisions are among the basic observables used to characterize the global properties of interactions, and thus are always a subject of interest at a new centre-of-mass energy. The behaviour of hadronic cross sections at high energies is usually described in the framework of Regge theory [1][2][3] and its various QCD-inspired e-mail: Martin.Poghosyan@cern.ch interpretations [4,5]. As these collisions are dominated by relatively small-momentum transfer processes, such measurements contribute to the theoretical understanding of QCD in the non-perturbative regime. Recent developments in the field can be found in Refs. [6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18]. As the LHC explores hadron collisions at centre-of-mass energies (up to \u221a s = 7 TeV used in the present analysis), corresponding to laboratory energies between 4 \u00d7 10 14 and 2.6 \u00d7 10 16 eV, close to the knee (10 15 -10 16 eV) observed in the energy distribution of cosmic rays, these measurements are also relevant in this context.",

Therefore, in this study, diffraction is defined using a large rapidity gap as signature, irrespective of the nature of the exchange. SD processes are those having a gap in rapidity from the leading proton limited by the value of the diffractive mass M X < 200 GeV/c 2 on the other side (i.e. at \u221a s = 7 TeV, \u03b7 7); other inelastic events are considered as NSD. The choice of the upper M X limit corresponds approximately to the acceptance of our experiment and was used in previous measurements [23]. DD processes are defined as NSD events with a pseudorapidity gap \u03b7 > 3 for charged particles. The same value was used for separation between DD and Non-Diffractive (ND) processes in another measurement [24].",

[1][2][3]). Each of the Reggeon legs can be a Pomeron or a secondary Reggeon (e.g. f -trajectories), resulting in eight different combinations of Pomerons and Reggeons. In the text, we use the notation (R 1 R 2 )R 3 for the configuration shown in this figure distribution (see, for example, the discussion in [30]). In Regge theory, in the single Regge pole approximation, the SD cross section (d\u03c3/dM X ) for producing a high-mass system, M X , is dominated by the diagram shown in Fig. 3. In the general case, each of the legs labeled (R 1 R 2 )R 3 , can be a Pomeron P or a secondary Reggeon R (e.g. the f -trajectory) [1][2][3]. At very high energies, the SD process is dominated by the (PP)P and (PP)R terms, which have similar energy dependence, but a different M X dependence. The (PP)P term is proportional to 1/M 1+2 X and the (PP)R term to 1/M 2+4 X , where = \u03b1 P \u2212 1, with \u03b1 P the intercept of the Pomeron trajectory. The (PP)R term dominates the process at very low mass, but vanishes at higher masses (M 2 X s 0 ), because the corresponding Regge trajectory has intercept smaller than unity.",

This is discussed, for example, in publications by the CDF collaboration [19,20], and supports the values of > 0 and also the above theoretical argument for inclusion of terms other than (PP)P. A recent version of PYTHIA having a steeper M X dependence at low masses, PYTHIA8 [31], uses an approximation with a 1/M 1+2 X dependence with = 0.085, based on the (PP)P term in the Donnachie-Landshoff model [32].",

The shaded area around the black line is delimited by (above at lower masses, below at higher masses) variation of the model [18], multiplying the distribution by a linear function which increases the probability at the threshold mass by a factor 1.5 (keeping the value at upper-mass cut-off unchanged, and then renormalizing the distribution back to unity), and by (below at lower masses, above at higher masses) Donnachie-Landshoff parametrization [32]. This represents the variation used for systematicuncertainty estimates in the present analysis. A 1/M X line is shown for comparison (magenta dotted-dashed line). At \u221a s = 7 TeV (right) black dashed-lines show 1/M 1+2 X distributions with = 0.085 and 0.1 also used with PYTHIA8 event generator in the ATLAS measurement of inelastic cross section [34] the SD cross section all eight terms contributing to the diagram of Fig. 3. Their relative contributions are determined from a fit to lower-energy data. The predictions of this model for the total, elastic, and diffractive cross sections at LHC energies [33] are found to be consistent with measurements [34][35][36].

            "text": "In order to estimate the systematic errors coming from the uncertainty in the functional shape of the M X dependence, the following modifications were used: the model distribution was multiplied by a linear function aM X + b, which is equal to unity at the upper diffractive-mass value M X = 200 GeV/c 2 and is equal to 0.5 or 1.5 at the diffractive-mass threshold, i.e. M X \u2248 1.08 GeV/c 2 (sum of proton and pion masses). A linear function was chosen because it is the simplest way to vary the relative fractions of low-mass (or non detected) and high-mass (or detected) single diffractive events. The resulting variation is illustrated in Fig. 4, where the diffractive-mass distributions are normalized to have the integral between threshold and M X = 200 GeV/c 2 equal to unity. The influence of the change of the M X dependence on the SD rate is given roughly by the variation of the yield in the high-M X region (above 10 GeV/c 2 , where the events are measured) relative to that in the low-M X region (where an extrapolation has to be used). The distribution from the Donnachie-Landshoff model [32] was also used in the evaluation of the systematic uncertainties due to the extrapolation to low-M X region. The ATLAS collaboration, in their measurement of the inelastic cross section [34], used unmodified PYTHIA6 and PHOJET event generators, with an approximate 1/M X dependence, the (PP)P term of the Donnachie-Landshoff model (as parameterized in PYTHIA8), around which they varied the mass distribution (see Fig. 4), and also the calculations with model [6][7][8]. Thanks to the collaboration of the authors of Refs. [6-9, 13-17] we were able to check that the single-diffraction mass dependencies of the corresponding models, when normalized at the M X = 200 GeV/c 2 , are well within the limits assumed in this analysis.",

Adjustments to these fractions can bring the predictions of the two generators into better agreement with the data, and lead to a method to estimate the DD fraction.

In addition to the quantities defined above, we use in this comparison the centre position \u03b7 gC of the \u03b7 pseudorapidity gap. The observed basic features of the edges of pseudorapidity distributions and gaps are reasonably well reproduced by the adjusted simulations for |\u03b7| \u2265 1.5, and more accurately for |\u03b7| \u2264 1.5. Figure 7 shows the \u221a s = 7 TeV case for illustration. The agreement between data and simulation is similar at \u221a s = 0.9 and 2.76 TeV. We note that there is less material in the R-side of the ALICE detector. With the adjusted Monte-Carlo generators we have obtained a good description for the 1-arm-R event class. On the L-side, there is more material between V0-L and the interaction point and the distribution of material is not as precisely known as on the other side. For this reason we have used a larger error margin in our study of the corresponding systematic uncertainty. Several tests were made to ensure that the material budget and the properties of the detectors do not modify the correlations between observables and rates of diffractive processes to be measured. The material budget was varied in the simulation by \u00b110 % everywhere, and by +50 % in the forward region only (|\u03b7| > 1). In both cases this did not modify the gap characteristics significantly. The maximum effect is for the largest \u03b7 bins in 2-arm events, and is still less than 10 %. The effect was found to be negligible for triggering and event classification efficiencies. In the region |\u03b7| \u2264 1 the material budget is known to better than 5 %. In order to assess the sensitivity of the results to details of the detector-response simulation, the properties of the pseudorapidity distribution and gaps were also studied with the simulation output after stage b (particle transport without detector response, using ideal hit positions). Only negligible differences between ideal and real detectors were found.",

For small diffractive masses, the produced particles have pseudorapidities close to that of the diffracted proton, therefore, such events are not detected. Increasing the mass of the diffractive system broadens the distribution of emitted particles, and the triggered events are classified mostly as 1-arm-L or 1-arm-R class. Increasing the diffractive mass still further results in a substantial probability of producing a particle in the hemisphere of the recoiling proton, and indeed for masses above \u223c200 GeV/c 2 such events end up mainly in the 2-arm class. Because of multiplicity fluctuations and detection efficiencies, it is also possible for a SD event to be classified in the opposite side 1-arm-R(L) class, albeit with a small probability (see Fig. 8). Masses above \u223c200 GeV/c 2 end up mainly in the 2-arm class, at all three energies. For this study, we have chosen M X = 200 GeV/c 2 as the boundary between SD and NSD events. Changing the upper diffractive-mass limit in the definition of SD from M X = 200 GeV/c 2 to M X = 50 GeV/c 2 or 100 GeV/c 2 at both \u221a s = 0.9 and 7 TeV does not make a difference to the final results for the inelastic cross section, provided the data are corrected using the same model as that used to parameterize the diffractive mass distribution. For example, at \u221a s = 0.9 TeV, if SD is defined for masses M X < 50 GeV/c 2 (M X < 100 GeV/c 2 ), the measured SD cross section decreases by 20 % (10 %), which agrees with the predictions of the model [18] used for corrections.",
