The jets are identified with the anti-k t algorithm with R \u00bc 0.4, and the spectra are measured over the kinematic range of jet transverse momentum 32 < p T < 500 GeV and absolute rapidity jyj < 2.1 and as a function of collision centrality. The nuclear modification factor R AA is evaluated, and jets are found to be suppressed by approximately a factor of 2 in central collisions compared to pp collisions. The R AA shows a slight increase with p T and no significant variation with rapidity.",

            "text": "Relativistic heavy-ion collisions at the LHC produce a medium of strongly interacting nuclear matter composed of deconfined color charges [1][2][3][4]. Hard scattering processes occurring in these collisions produce high transverse momentum (p T ) partons that propagate through the medium and lose energy, resulting in the phenomenon of \"jet quenching.\" The partonic energy loss can be probed through measurements of the suppression of jet production rates. The effects of energy loss have been observed through the suppression of single hadrons [5][6][7][8][9][10][11] and jets constructed from charged particles [12]. ATLAS has previously reported measurements with fully reconstructed jets [13] by comparing the jet yields in central collisions, where the colliding nuclei have a large overlap, to the yields in peripheral collisions. Those results indicate that the rate of jets in Pb \u00fe Pb collisions is suppressed by a factor of approximately 2 in central collisions relative to peripheral collisions. A more sensitive probe of energy loss is provided by measurements of the suppression relative to pp collisions, where there are no quenching effects.",

A separate PYTHIA sample was produced for the analysis of the pp data with the detector simulation adjusted to match the conditions during the pp data taking including pile-up. Additional MC samples were used in evaluations of the jet energy scale (JES) uncertainty. The PYQUEN generator [30], which applies medium-induced energy loss to parton showers produced by PYTHIA, was used to generate a sample of jets with fragmentation functions that differ from those in the nominal PYTHIA sample in a fashion consistent with measurements of fragmentation functions in quenched jets [31][32][33]. The jet spectra, defined to be the average differential yield in a given p T bin, were constructed from a mixture of minimum-bias (Pb \u00fe Pb only) and jet-triggered samples. In each p T bin, the trigger with the most events and that was more than 99% efficient for that bin was used. The jet spectra were unfolded [13] to account for the p T bin migration induced by the jet energy resolution (JER) using a method based on the singular value decomposition [34]. The effects of the JER, which receives contributions from both the detector response and UE fluctuations, were evaluated by applying the same procedure to the MC samples as was applied to the data and by matching the ",

No significant slope is observed in the most peripheral collisions. The R AA decreases gradually with increasing hN part i. At forward rapidity, the increasing steepness of the jet production spectrum is expected to result in more suppression of the jet yields. In this kinematic region, the production is increasingly dominated by quark jets, which may lose less energy than gluon jets [15].
