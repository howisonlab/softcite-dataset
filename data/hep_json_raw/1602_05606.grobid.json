The dataset corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb \u22121 and was produced with a centre-of-mass energy of \u221a s = 8 TeV. This analysis targets Q \u2192 W b decays where the W boson decays leptonically. A veto on massive largeradius jets is used to reject the dominant tt background. The reconstructed Q-candidate mass, ranging from 0.4 to 1.2 TeV, is used in the search to discriminate signal from background processes. No significant deviation from the Standard Model expectation is observed, and limits are set on the Q \u2192 W b cross-section times branching ratio. The results are also interpreted as limits on the QW b coupling and the mixing with the Standard Model sector for a singlet T quark or a Y quark from a doublet. T quarks with masses below 0.95 TeV are excluded at 95 % confidence level, assuming a unit coupling and a BR(T \u2192 W b) = 0.5, whereas the expected limit is 1.10 TeV.",

The existence of heavy vector-like quarks [4] would allow for the cancellation of quadratic divergences that occur in loop corrections to the Higgs-boson mass, solving the fine-tuning problem. Vectorlike quarks are defined as coloured (under SU(3) c ) fermionic states that have left-handed and right-handed components that both transform in the same way in the SM gauge group and therefore their masses are not obtained by a Yukawa coupling to the Higgs boson. Their existence is, for example, predicted in Little Higgs models [5][6][7], top-colour assisted technicolour [8][9][10] or composite Higgs models [11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18].",

Heavy exotic fermions, such as vector-like quarks, are added to the SM in isospin multiplets. T quarks can belong to any multiplet, while Y quarks cannot exist as singlets. The interpretation used in this paper focuses on Y quarks from a (Y, B) doublet and on singlet T quarks. For such T quarks, the branching ratios (BRs) for T are model dependent and mass dependent, but in the high-mass limit converge towards 2:1:1 (W b:Zt:Ht). The Y \u2192 W b BR is 100 %.",

            "text": "The single production of vector-like quarks is enabled by their coupling to the SM quarks. At higher masses, single production can become the dominant production pro- cess at the LHC depending on the strength of this coupling. This dependence requires an interpretation of the results that relies on the formulation of the Lagrangian embedding these new interactions. In this paper, two such interpretations are pursued, namely that in Ref. [19] where a mixing term between the SM and vector-like quarks is introduced in a renormalisable extension of the SM, and in Refs. [20,21] which uses a phenomenological Lagrangian parameterised with coupling terms but which, however, is non-renormalisable. When considering the phenomenology of these approaches, the two main differences are the additional terms allowed in Refs. [20,21], which allow for larger production cross-sections, and the complete description of the multiplet-dimension dependence of the BR in Ref. [19]. The formulation of Ref. [19] also implies sensitivity to indirect electroweak constraints, such as the ratio R b of the partial width for Z \u2192 bb to the total hadronic Z -boson width and the oblique parameters S and T [22]. In this paper, the interpretation of the search for the single production of vector-like quarks is presented in terms of sin \u03b8 and c W b , corresponding to the mixing and coupling terms introduced by Ref. [19] and Refs. [20,21], respectively. A comparison of their respective Lagrangians yields a simple relation 1 between sin \u03b8 and c W b given by c W b = \u221a 2 sin \u03b8 . For the interpretation in terms of c W b , assumptions must be made about the Q \u2192 W b, Q \u2192 Zt and Q \u2192 Ht BRs, whereas sin \u03b8 fully determines those BRs for any given heavy quark mass. Therefore, in this paper, both interpretations are presented independently. The relative contribution of the leftand right-handed components of the mixing and coupling also depends on the dimension of the multiplet. For T singlets, the left-handed components (sin \u03b8 L and c W b L ) are dominant. For Y quarks from a doublet, results are presented in 1 This relationship is only true within the regime of validity of the renormalisable formulation, and if one considers only the interactions between Q,W and b.",

The outgoing light quark in the process depicted in Fig. 1 typically produces a jet in the forward region of the detector. One of the jets is a bjet originating from the Q decay. The b-jet and the charged lepton are back-to-back in the transverse plane since both originate from the decay of a heavy object. The second b-jet originates from the gluon splitting and may be observed in either the forward or central region. Since this b-jet is soft, it often falls outside the detector acceptance. The dominant backgrounds are W +jets, top-quark pair and single top-quark production. At higher p T of top quarks and W bosons, their decay products are more collimated. They can be identified as one high-mass jet with a large radius parameter (R). Events with high-mass large-R jets are vetoed to improve the suppression of the large tt \u2192 W bW b background process where one W -boson decays hadronically and the other leptonically.",

[34] and are generated with MadGraph v5 [35] using a UFO model [36,37] and the CTEQ6L1 parton distribution functions (PDFs) [38]. The samples are generated in the tchannel using the 2 \u2192 3 process pp \u2192 q Qb, with Q decaying exclusively into W b and W decaying inclusively into all the available modes. In the case that a branching ratio of 50 % is used, the corresponding signal yields are scaled by a factor of 0.5. Other decay modes of Q are assumed to be negligible and are not taken into account. The events are interfaced with Pythia8 [39] for parton showering, hadronisation and particle decay. Signal samples are generated with different Q masses in the range 0.4-1.2 TeV in steps of 0.1 TeV. All signal samples are produced using the narrow-width approximation with a width of /m = 7 %. Additional samples with /m varying from 2 to 46 % are used to examine the dependence of the vector-like quark width on c W b L . The dominant backgrounds are tt, W +jets and single top-quark production. Smaller background contributions are Z +jets, diboson and multijet production. The tt and single top-quark processes are modelled using the next-to-leadingorder (NLO) Powheg-Box generator r2330.3 [40] using the CT10 PDFs [41]. Powheg-Box is then interfaced with Pythia v6.4 [42] with the Perugia 2011C set of tuned parameters [43] and the CTEQ6L1 PDFs. The top-quark mass is set to 172.5 GeV in all samples. The Alpgen v2.13 [44] LO generator and the CTEQ6L1 PDF set are used to simulate W /Z production. Parton showers and hadronisation are modelled with Pythia v6.4. The W /Z samples are generated with up to five additional partons, separately for W /Z +light-jet, W /Z + bb, W /Z + cc and W c. To avoid double-counting of partonic configurations generated by both the matrix-element calculation and the parton-shower evolution, a parton-jet matching scheme (MLM matching) [45] is employed. The overlap between W /Z + qq (q = b, c) events generated from the matrix-element calculation and those generated from parton-shower evolution in the W /Z +light-jet samples is avoided via an algorithm based on the distance in \u03b7 \u2212 \u03c6 space between the heavy quarks: if R(q,q) > 0.4, the matrix-element prediction is used, otherwise the partonshower prediction is used. Diboson samples with at least one leptonically-decaying boson are produced using Herwig v6.52 [46] and Jimmy v4.31 [47] using the CTEQ6L1 PDFs. Multijet production is modelled from data as described later.",

Furthermore, this lepton must be matched to the lepton that was reconstructed by the trigger.

The first step is the reconstruction of the W -boson candidate by summing the four-momenta of the charged lepton and the neutrino. To obtain the z-component of the neutrino momentum, the lepton-neutrino invariant mass is set to the W -boson mass and the resulting quadratic equation is solved. If no real solution exists, the E miss T vector is varied by the minimum amount required to produce exactly one real solution. If two real solutions are found, the one with the smallest | p z | is used. The W -boson candidate and the small-R b-jet, which is matched to the large-R jet, are then used to reconstruct the Q candidate. Hence, no large-R jet information is used directly for the reconstruction of the discriminant, which reduces the dependence of the final result on the systematic uncertainties of the large-R jet kinematics. In Fig. 4 the distribution of the Q-candidate mass in the SR is compared to the SM background prediction and the signal distributions for m(Q) = 0.7 and 0.9 TeV.",

The expected upper limit on the cross-section is determined using pseudo-data constructed from a background-only model built from the nuisance parameters fitted to real data. The limits include full statistical and systematic uncertainties and are compared to the maximum allowed cross-sections for T bj and Y bj from electroweak constraints [19] and the NLO cross-section prediction for c W b L = 1 [21]. The observed direct limits are less stringent than the indirect limits on the maximum crosssections from Ref. [19], but rely on fewer assumptions about the new physics that would produce T or Y quarks. Fig. 6 Observed and expected limits on the cross-section times BR for the single production of a vector-like quark Q \u2192 W b as a function of the Q mass. The limits are shown compared to three theoretical predictions: the NLO cross-section prediction in the composite-Higgsmodel scenario [21] (brown dot-dashed line), and the maximum crosssections for T bj (red dashed line) and Y bj (black dashed line) [19] More events than predicted are observed for the higher mass values, leading to a less stringent observed limit for masses above 0.8 TeV. These differences are, however, within the 1\u03c3 uncertainty band. The mass limit is obtained from the intersection of the NLO prediction with the curve for the observed cross-section times BR limit. The observed (expected) limit on the Q-candidate mass obtained for this scenario is 0.95 (1.10) TeV. The limits are shown compared to the indirect electroweak constraints from Ref. [19] (green and red line). In addition, the observed limits from pair-production searches by ATLAS [23] (olive) and CMS [27] (blue) are shown The limit set on the cross-section times branching ratio can be translated into a limit on c W b L , using the relation (1) and the theoretical predictions from Ref. [21]. For the theoretical prediction the value of c W b L was set to 1.0. The expected and observed limits are shown in Fig. 7a. These limits exclude couplings above 0.6 for masses below 0.7 TeV and above c W b L = 1.2 for a T quark with a mass of 1.2 TeV. The limits on the mixing angle between the vector-like quark and the SM sector are derived in a similar fashion and are shown in Fig. 7b.

As described in Sect. 3, a narrow-width approximation is used in the production of the signal samples. To test the validity of the lim-its shown in Fig. 7, the limits were recalculated for signal samples with /m values up to 0.46, using the same theoretical cross-section prediction. For all masses and /m the observed limit is found to be more stringent than, or equal to, the value obtained for the narrow-width approximation. For m(Q) = 0.9 TeV the cross-section times BR limit decreases by 15 % (20 %) for /m = 0.3 ( /m = 0.46) and for m(Q) = 1.2 TeV the limit decreases by 13 % (21 %) for /m = 0.3 ( /m = 0.46). Hence, the limits presented in this paper constitute a conservative estimate regarding the assumptions about the width of vector-like quarks.",

The effect on the signal yields is quoted for a Q candidate with m(Q) = 0.7 TeV. In order to model the uncertainty on the b-jet identification, the b-tagging and mistagging scale factors are varied[61]. Large statistical fluctuations for high-momentum bjets cause the corresponding systematic component to have a large impact on the total normalisation. The b-tagging uncertainties affect the background by 1.5 % and the signal acceptance by 8 %.
