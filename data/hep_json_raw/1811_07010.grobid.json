The search uses proton-proton collision data collected in 2016 with the CMS detector at the LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 at \u221a s = 13 TeV. Both decay channels result in a final state with a top quark, a Higgs boson, and a b quark, each produced with significant energy. The all-hadronic decays of both the Higgs boson and the top quark are considered. The finalstate jets, some of which correspond to merged decay products of a boosted top quark and a Higgs boson, are selected using jet substructure techniques, which help to suppress standard model backgrounds. A W boson signal would appear as a narrow peak in the invariant mass distribution of these jets. No significant deviation in data with respect to the standard model background predictions is observed. Cross section upper limits on W boson production in the top quark, Higgs boson, and b quark decay mode are set as a function of the W mass, for several vector-like quark mass hypotheses. These are the first limits for W boson production in this decay channel, and cover a range of 0.01 to 0.43 pb in the W mass range between 1.5 and 4.0 TeV.",

The W boson is a hypothetical heavy partner of the SM W gauge boson that could be produced in proton-proton (pp) collisions at the CERN LHC. Searches for W bosons have been most recently performed at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV by the CMS and ATLAS Collaborations in the lepton-neutrino [4,5], diboson [6,7], and diquark [8,9] final states. Vector-like quarks (VLQs) are hypothetical heavy partners of SM quarks for which the left-and right-handed chiralities transform the same way under SM gauge groups. Searches for VLQs have been performed by the CMS and ATLAS Collaborations in both the single [10][11][12][13] and pair production [14][15][16] channels. The decay of the W boson to a heavy B or T VLQ and a top or b quark, respectively, is predicted, e.g., in composite Higgs boson models with custodial symmetry protection [17][18][19]. These models stabilize the quantum corrections to the Higgs mass and preserve naturalness. The W branching fraction to a quark and a VLQ depends on the VLQ mass, with a maximum of 50% in the high VLQ mass range at the threshold of custodian production (see ref. [20]).",

Because of the high W and VLQ masses considered in this analysis, the decay products are highly Lorentz boosted. These boosted decay products are reconstructed as single jets with distinct substructure, which is used in the analysis to distinguish them from SM multijet production. An inclusive search for a W boson decaying to a top quark, a Higgs boson, and a b quark is performed. The SM background is dominated by events comprised of jets produced via the strong interaction, referred to as quantum chromodynamics (QCD) multijet events, and top quark pair production (tt) events. These backgrounds are modeled by a combination of Monte Carlo (MC) simulation and control regions in data. The invariant mass distribution of the three-jet system, m tHb , is used to set the first limits on the W boson production cross section in the decay channel to a B or T VLQ.

In this model the top and W are superpositions of elementary and composite modes, with the top degree of compositeness given by s L , and the mixing angle of the elementary and composite W states given by \u03b8 2 . The W boson production cross section is inversely proportional to cot 2 (\u03b8 2 ), but low cot(\u03b8 2 ) values tend to be dominated by the leptonic W boson decay mode. High values of the s L parameter increase the relative phase space for the decay into two VLQs, whereas low s L values enhance the W diboson decays. The analysis assumes this theoretical framework as evaluated at s L = 0.5 and cot(\u03b8 2 ) = 3, which is chosen for the purposes of sensitivity in the W decay channel to a single VLQ. The expected signal cross sections in the analysis are evaluated at 13 TeV using the framework of ref. [20] for W masses in the range 1.5 to 4.0 TeV with the assumptions that the W \u2192VLQ branching fraction is equally distributed between the tB and bT final states.

Jet momentum is determined as the vectorial sum of all particle momenta in the jet, and is found from simulation to be within 5 to 10% of the true momentum over the whole p T spectrum and detector acceptance. Additional pp interactions within the same or nearby bunch crossings (pileup) can contribute additional tracks and calorimetric energy depositions to the jet momentum. To mitigate this effect, charged particles originating from sub-leading pp collision vertices within the same or adjacent bunch crossings are discarded in the jet clustering procedure, where the primary collision vertex is defined as the vertex largest quadrature-summed p T of all reconstructed particles. To account for the neutral pileup component, the pileup per particle identification (PUPPI) algorithm [26] is used, which applies weights that rescale the jet transverse momentum based on the per-particle probability of originating from the primary vertex prior to jet clustering. Jet energy corrections are derived from simulation studies so that the average measured response of jets becomes identical to that of particle level jets. In situ measurements of the momentum balance in dijet, photon+jet, Z+jet, and multijet events are used to determine any residual differences between the jet energy scale in data and in simulation, and appropriate corrections are made [27]. Additional selection criteria are applied to each jet to remove jets potentially dominated by instrumental effects or reconstruction failures. The jet energy resolution amounts typically to 15% at 10 GeV, 8% at 100 GeV, and 4% at 1 TeV, to be compared to about 40, 12, and 5% obtained when the calorimeters alone are used for jet clustering.",

The analysis uses a QCD multijet sample as a cross check for the background estimate, which is also generated at LO with MadGraph5 amc@nlo. Parton showering and hadronization are simulated with pythia8.212 [35] using either the CUETP8M2T4 [36] or CUETP8M1 [37] underlying event tunes. For each W boson mass point, three VLQ mass points are generated with the VLQ mass range from 0.8 to 3.0 TeV. The generated VLQ masses are scaled to the W boson mass (m W ) such that there is a low (\u2248 1/2m W ), medium (\u2248 2/3m W ), and high (\u2248 3/4m W ) mass sample for each W boson mass point in order to explore the sensitive phase space of the boosted W boson decay products. The generated W boson and VLQ widths are narrow as compared with the detector and reconstruction resolutions which is in accord with theoretical predictions for most of the analyzed phase space. The simulation of the CMS detector uses Geant4 [38]. All MC samples include pileup simulation and are weighted such that the distribution of the number of interactions per bunch crossing agrees with that observed in data.",

The jets from the top quark (top jet) and Higgs boson (Higgs jet) decays tend to be wide and massive, whereas the jet from the b quark (b jet) will tend to be narrow and have a lower mass. Therefore, one jet clustered with the anti-k T algorithm with a distance parameter of 0.8 (AK8 jet) with p T > 300 GeV is required for the Higgs boson candidate jet. One AK8 jet with p T > 400 GeV is required for the top quark candidate jet. One anti-k T jet with a distance parameter of 0.4 (AK4 jet) with p T > 200 GeV is required for the b candidate jet. The separation \u2206R ( \u221a (\u2206\u03c6) 2 + (\u2206\u03b7) 2 ) between the two AK8 jets is required to be at least 1.8 in order to reduce the correlation of jet shapes arising from the abutting of jet boundaries, which can bias the background estimate. The AK8 jets are then selected as being consistent with a top quark or a Higgs boson decay using the tagging procedures defined below. The collection of jets considered for the b quark candidate is then populated by AK4 jets with \u2206R of at least 1.2 from the tagged AK8 jets. In the case of multiple jets with the same tag, the tagged candidate is chosen randomly. Jet identification criteria are used for these three jets in order to reduce the impact of spurious jets from detector noise [39]. All jets in the analysis are required to be within |\u03b7| < 2.4.",

The data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 collected in 2016 with the CMS detector at the LHC. The signature considered for both decay modes is a top quark and a Higgs boson, both decaying hadronically, and a b quark jet. Boosted heavy-resonance identification techniques are used to exploit the event signature of three energetic jets and to suppress standard model backgrounds. No significant deviation from the standard model background prediction has been observed. Cross section upper limits on W boson production in the top quark, Higgs boson, and b quark decay mode are set as a function of the W mass, for several vector-like quark mass hypotheses. These are the first limits for W boson production in this decay channel, and cover a range of 0.01 to 0.43 pb in the W mass range between 1.5 and 4.0 TeV.",
