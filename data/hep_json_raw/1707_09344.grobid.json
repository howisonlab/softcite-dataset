Events with a W decaying into lepton and neutrino (W \u2192 \u03bd) can be easily triggered and selected with high purity. However, the neutrino escaping detection prevents the direct measurement of the W differential production cross sections. Particularly, the rapidity and polarisation distributions of the W must be inferred by the proton Parton Distribution Functions (PDFs). In turn, the PDFs have been constrained by measuring asymmetries in events where a W boson is produced.",

This observable is sensitive to the ratio of the u quark and d quark PDFs. Another observable constraining the PDFs is the lepton charge asymmetry, the relative rate of the charged leptons from W decays, as a function of the lepton pseudorapidity. It has been measured at the Tevatron and LHC [10][11][12][13][14][15][16]. All these measurements have been used to constrain the PDFs, which are then used to compute the rapidity and polarisation distributions of the W . A possible extension of the method of reference [3] to LHC has been studied in [17] concluding that in proton proton collisions this technique is less useful for placing constraints on the PDFs than a measurement of the lepton charge asymmetry.",

            "text": "The fit is done on a sample of 18 \u2022 10 6 W + events in the acceptance. This corresponds to less than 30% of the statistics accumulated by CMS in the 8 TeV run [14]. The \u03c7 2 at the minimum is 1325 for 1237 degrees of freedom. The bins constrained to the PDFs prediction are the first two bins where the rate is close to zero. The \u03c7 2 computed at the true value, corresponding to the prediction of the PDFs, is 1340. Figure 4a shows the correlation matrix returned by the fit. Yields in nearby bins are correlated due to some overlap in the templates caused by the p W t distribution. These correlations result in small oscillations in the central values of the fit that can be possibly mitigated with regularisation methods or using larger rapidity bins at the expense of a less detailed description of the rapidity distribution. The bins at large \u00b1y are also somewhat correlated because at large rapidity it is more difficult to separate the two helicity states.   The result of the fit is shown in figure 4b. This figure shows the rapidity distributions of W + bosons with spin pointing to the negative z axis. It can be compared to figure 1a, where the blue curve is taken for the negative rapidity and the red for the positive rapidity. The very thin uncertainty band shown on the result of the fit includes the full effect of the correlation matrix. It has been computed diagonalising the correlation matrix and summing in quadrature the 17 independent variations of 1 \u03c3. The distribution for W + with spin pointing to the positive z axis is the symmetric distribution. Figure 5a shows the comparison between the nominal W + rapidity distribution computed with the PDFs, shown in figure 1, and the result of the fit. The systematic differences in the central values reflect the small oscillatory behaviour discussed above. Figure 5b shows the difference between the fit and the PDFs prediction, while figure 5c shows the direct comparison between the PDFs prediction uncertainty band and the fit uncertainty band: one notices that the statistical precision of the fit has a substantially smaller uncertainty than the PDFs prediction, assuming that the oscillations seen with this simple fit can be regularised. There are several assumptions that may affect systematically the production of the templates. We have investigated the effect of the uncertainty in the lepton trigger and identification efficiency as function of \u03b7 , the uncertainty on the assumed values of the W mass and the uncertainty on the shape of the p W t spectrum. The first two effects induce changes on the shape that are smaller than the statistical uncertainty for a 1% random efficiency shift uncorrelated in each \u03b7 bin or for a shift of the W mass of 50 MeV. A systematic parabolic change of the shape of the average of p W t as a function of y by 2% has also negligible effect. The largest systematic is induced by a change in the spectrum of p W t . The spectrum has been modified with different slopes compatible with the uncertainty band shown in figure 6 of reference [24]. Figure 5d shows the induced shape variation of the fit compared with the statistical uncertainty band. The variation is larger than the statistical error of the fit, showing that the measurement will be systematically limited. On the other hand, this variation is comparable and somewhat smaller than the uncertainty on the rapidity/helicity distribution computed with the PDFs (figure 5c), showing that the proposed method has the potentiality of reducing the uncertainty on the W rapidity and helicity distributions. The analysis performed with simulated W \u2212 events shows similar results.",

These distributions may be used for a direct measurement of the W + and W \u2212 JHEP12(2017)130 rapidity for the two helicity states of W bosons produced at small transverse momentum. This measurement has a statistical uncertainty much smaller than the PDFs prediction. The final systematic accuracy of the measurement can only be assessed with a full analysis of the data already collected by the LHC experiments. At the level of the simple analysis shown in this paper, the proposed method has the potentiality of reducing the uncertainty on the W rapidity and helicity distribution. An improved determination of the rapidity and helicity distributions of the W + and W \u2212 will result in a smaller systematic uncertainty in the measurement of W mass at LHC.",
