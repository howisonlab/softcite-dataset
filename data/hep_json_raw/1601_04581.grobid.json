Data taking of the first phase was performed only with a passive shielding system, and dark matter results were published with 14.6 kg-days of data taken from August to September, 2012 and a threshold of 400 eVee [9]. Starting November 2013, Phase-II measurements are based on the design of earlier work [8,10], with an active NaI(Tl) anti-Compton (NaI-AC) detector installed. First results with 53.9 kg-days of data were reported [11], providing an order of magnitude improvement on the spin-independent \u03c7-N coupling (WIMPs denoted by \u03c7).

The flux of cosmic ray and associated backgrounds is down to 61.7 y \u22121 \u2022m \u22122 [13]. In addition, the radioactivities of 232 Th, 238 U and 40 K from rock surrounded CJPL were very low based on in situ measurement [14]. The low cosmic-ray flux and radioactivities of 238 U and 232 Th give rise to low level of neutron flux. arXiv:1601.04581v1 [hep-ex] 18 Jan 2016 B. Detector Hardware CDEX-1 experiment adopted one single module at 1kgscale mass pPCGe to search for WIMPs. The p-type germanium crystal is a cylinder with about 62 mm of both height and diameter which give rise to 994 g mass. It has two electrodes, the outer electrode is n + type, providing high voltage (HV) and signal, and the tiny point-like center electrode is p + type, with order of 1 mm diameter resulting in order of 1 pF capacitance, leading to low energy threshold in potential. At phase I experiment, the outer electrode signal was read out by a resistive feedback preamplifier [9]. At phase II measurement, the signal output was removed due to its induced noise, such that the outer electrode served only as a HV electrode. The center electrode signal was read out by an ultra-low noise JFET nearby and then supplied into a pulsed-reset feedback preamplifier. The preamplifier generates three identical energy-related signals (OUT \u2212 E), one timing-related signal (OUT \u2212 T) and one inhibit signal (IHB) marking the inactive time of the preamplifier. Meanwhile, the preamplifier can accept a test input, typically from an electronic pulser to simulate physical signals.",

The three identical OUT \u2212 E signals were loaded to shaping amplifiers (CANBERRA 2026) at 6 us (S p6 ), 12 us shaping time (S p12 ) and a timing amplifier (CANBERRA 2111) (T p ), respectively. Each gain of these amplifiers was adjusted to achieve maximal signal-to-noise ratio and maximal information for low energy events. The energy range was limited to 12 keVee. The S p6,12 signal provided energy measurement and system trigger of the data acquisition (DAQ). The T p signal recorded the raw pulse shape information of one event, so it can provide the rise time information. The OUT \u2212 T signal was distributed into a timing amplifier with low gain to measure high energy backgrounds, intending to analysis background source and opening a window to study 76 Ge neutrinoless double-beta decay. These outputs were digitized and recorded by a flash analog-to-digital convertor (FADC, CAEN V1724) at 100 MHz sampling rate with a resolution of 14 bit. The data acquisition software is based on LabVIEW program. The discriminator output of the inhibit signal provided another trigger of the DAQ and was recorded to determine the exact time of the beginning of discharge process of the preamplifier.

Two energy-related parameters are defined: (i) maximal amplitude of one pulse (A max ); (ii) integration of one pulse (Q). Optimized partial integration of S p6 was chosen to define as energy (T) for its excellent energy linearity at low energy range. Since the active volume of pPCGe crystal is surrounded by \u223c 1.0 mm dead layer and 1.5 mm of OFHC copper cryostat, external low energy X-rays at at < 50 keVee range cannot penetrate into the pPCGe crystal. Energy calibration was therefore done with its internal characteristic X-rays originated from the electron capture (EC) of the cosmogenic radioisotopes [9,11,15]. Figure 5(a) shows the energy calibration by the two dominant K-shell X-rays: 68 Ge (10.368 keVee), 65 Zn (8.98 keVee) and RT events (0 keVee). The inset figure displays energy difference between the calibrated energy and the real energy of these three peaks, together with other peaks observed in the measured CDEX-1 background spectrum, demonstrating good linearity of less than 0.8% deviation. The relationship between energy and its resolution is also depicted in Figure 5(b), showing good linearity between \u221a T and the energy resolution FWHM (Full Width at Half Maximum).

It is crucial to know the relation between QF and nuclear recoil energy in the studies of WIMP search. Figure 7 showed a compilation of all experiment measurements and calculations of QF for recoiled germanium nuclei [11]. Several experiments have measured the QF down to a few keVnr (nuclear recoil energy). Typically, two methods can be used to calculate the QF for different nuclear recoil energy. In TRIM software simulation, several aspects of stopping power, range and straggling distributions of a recoiled nucleon with certain energy are considered, while Hartree-Fock atoms and lattice effects are also included [16]. In analytic Lindhard calculation, an ideal and static atom is adopted, and Lindhard model is parameterized to a constant k which is related to stopping power [17]. The TRIM results agree well with the QF experimental results at a larger energy range and therefore are adopted in our analysis. As illustrated in Figure 7, QF function derived from TRIM with a 10% systematic uncertainty is applied in our analysis.",

This dead layer is composed of to- tally dead layer where the electric field is zero, and transition layer where the electric field is weak. Interior to transition layer is active volume. Electron-hole pairs generated from events taking place in transition layer have slower drift velocity than those in active volume, leading to pulse with typically slow rise time as well as degraded amplitude due to partial charge collection [18]. We denoted events at the active volume with complete charge collection as bulk events and events at the dead layer as surface events, as illustrated in Figure 8. The totally dead layer acts as passive shield against external low energy \u03b3/\u03b2, and transition layer acts as active shield against ambient gamma rays through bulk/surface events discrimination based on rise time characteristics. This is self-shield effect of pPCGe. On the contrary, the dead layer produced fiducial mass loss. Since the attenuation of gamma rays by the dead layer was dependent on energy, the ratio of these gamma rays at photoelectron peaks would be changed. 133 Ba source with various energy gamma rays was used to measure the thickness of the dead layer for the pPCGe, and it was derived to be (1.02\u00b10.14) mm via comparison of measured and simulated intensity ratios of those gamma peaks [19].

            "text": "This basic criteria were aimed to differentiate physical events from electronic noise and spurious signals, such as microphonics. Several methods were applied to eliminate noise events according to their characteristics. The first method was based on timing information of events, derived from the distribution of parameters T \u2212 and T + , and the class of mid-period noise with obvious timing distinction was identified and wiped out by the TT cut as shown in Figure 11. The second method was deduced from pedestal of S p6,12 and T p (Ped), which was irrelevant to the pulse shape, and therefore the criteria was defined by RT events. This method was used to discriminate the noise events whose pedestals behaved anomalously, which was mostly originated from IHB signals, as illustrated in Figure 12. Both TT and Ped cuts are independent on event energy. The third method was dependent on pulse shape discrimination (PSD), which was on the basis of correlations of A min , A max , Q and T max , since physical events performs different distributions in these parameters from those of noise events. The criteria was determined by physical events defined by AC + events of 137 Cs calibration data, as depicted in Figure 13. 2. AC + versus AC \u2212 events selection (AC cut): Considering the \u03c7N interaction cross section, WIMPs can hardly induce signals in both pPCGe and NaI-AC detectors. However, \u03b3 ray can produce signals in both detectors. The distribution of \u2206t was presented in Figure 14. The AC + events with coincidence of pPCGe and NaI-AC distributed in the specific band, while AC \u2212 and RT events has a fixed \u2206t except for events with accidental coincidence. The accidental coincidence events are uniformly distributed in the time range. The trigger timing is defined by a constant amplitude discriminator of the S p6 signal, such that \u2206t between the two detectors varies with energy.",

In particular, (a) The leading systematic uncertainties is from the Bevent selection and (\u03b5 BS , \u03bb BS ) calibration due to possible differences in locations and energy spectra between the calibration sources and background events. The calibration sources probe the surface effects due to both low energy (surface richer) and high energy (bulk richer) photons. The \u03c4 distributions for B-events are identical for both sources and physics background, while those for S-events showed intrinsic difference due to the difference in surface penetration which manifest as the difference of slopes in the (\u03b5 BS , \u03bb BS ) plane [11].The systematic uncertainties are derived from the spread of the (\u03b5 BS , \u03bb BS ) intersections of calibration bands, relative to the combined best-fit solution. This leads to a 25.0% contribution to the total error in the efficiencies-corrected Bulk rates B 0 , accounting for the most significant in the total systematic uncertainty. (b) The systematic uncertainties related with different locations are studied with the sources placed at several positions of the top and the side (the cylindrical surface) of the pPCGe. Among them, the 241 Am \u03b3 from the side are strongly attenuated due to additional thickness from the cylindrical copper support structure and curved surface of the germanium crystal and therefore do not produce useful signals. The higher energy \u03b3 from 57 Co, 137 Cs and 60 Co at top and side, as well as those from physics samples (BC\u2297AC + and BC\u2297AC \u2212 ), show similar distributions in \u03c4 , independent of locations. The shift in (\u03b5 BS , \u03bb BS ) based on calibration source data at different locations is less than 4%, corresponding to a 3.7% contribution to the total error in the efficiencies-corrected Bulk rates B 0 .",

It was crucial to develop new method to evaluate the (\u03b5 BS , \u03bb BS ) to decrease the systematic uncertainty further which contributes the main part of the systematic uncertainty.",
