A standard long-baseline experiment using two fixed-distance detectors therefore needs to be able to reconstruct the neutrino energy on an eventby-event basis in order to infer precise oscillation parameters. This is why in recent years there has been a lot of discussion of unbiased neutrino energy reconstruction based on particles detected in the final state after escaping the target nucleus. The topic is important because neutrino fluxes are never mono-energetic and even in an off-axis configuration have a significant spread. The discussion has became even more intense after realizing that in the few GeV energy region (where most current and planned long baseline oscillation experiments operate) there is a significant contribution from two-body current mechanism making the situation even more complicated [1][2][3].

If the momentum and energy transferred to the hadronic system is large enough, one can rely on the impulse approximation (IA) [5] according to which interactions occur on individual (bound and moving) nucleons and the meaning of CCQE remains valid. This is confirmed by the clear observation of a QE peak in electron nucleus target inclusive cross section measurements [6]. In neutrino experiments, an analogous identification of the QE peak is impossible, because one does not know the amount of energy and momentum transferred to the nucleus on an event by event basis (for a recent attempt to estimate these quantities in neutrino experiment see Ref.

            "text": "In the IA picture, neutrino scattering is a two step process where a primary interaction on a bound nucleon (or nucleon pair) is followed by hadron rescatterings called final state interactions (FSI). This is why neutrino experimental groups introduced the notion of CCQE-like events. They are defined as those with a muon and no mesons in the final state (i.e. 1\u00b5 + 0\u03c0 + X, where X represents any number of nucleons). The advantage of this notion is that it is defined with no ambiguity and also it is relatively close to genuine CCQE in the IA picture. A widely discussed MiniBooNE measurement of the CCQE double differential cross section [1] was in fact a CCQE-like measurement after the results from tables VI and VIII in Ref. [1] are added. A more recent measurement of a CCQE-like cross section was reported by T2K [8]. In all cases, CCQE-like samples of events contain also those in which a real pion is first produced and then absorbed, and also those arising from a two-body mechanism, typically leading to two nucleon knock-out. Notice also that a true CCQE event will occasionally produce pions through FSI and thus not be classified as CCQE-like. A precise description of neutrino interactions in the few GeV energy region requires a careful combination of several dynamical models. This has been the motivation for numerous neutrino Monte Carlo (MC) event generators studies [9].",

The method works for events with exactly two particles detected in the final state: muon and proton. Muon identification is usually quite simple, however reconstructing the short tracks left by protons is more challenging. Nevertheless, in recent years experimental groups like T2K, MINER\u03bdA, ArgoNeuT have presented various studies using information from protons, see e.g. Ref. [10]. The ability to reconstruct a final state proton depends strongly on the details of the detector technique used. In segmented scintillators used by T2K in a near detector and by MINERvA a typical threshold for proton identification is \u223c 400 MeV/c. However, in liquid argon used in ArgoNeuT, MicroBooNE and proposed in the DUNE experiment the threshold is much lower: \u223c 200 MeV/c.",

The relative population of subsamples (i) and (ii) depends on the probability that a proton traverses the nucleus without interacting. This probability is often expressed as the nuclear transparency.

From here on we refer to our sample of 1\u00b5 + 0\u03c0 + 1p events as CC0\u03c01p. This sample is unambiguously defined, provided the proton detection threshold is known. Our argument is rather elementary and is based merely on energy and momentum conservation. If the event is indeed CCQE with no proton final state interactions, energy and momentum conservation allow one to resolve the kinematics of the process completely and calculate the initial neutrino and neutron three-momenta. Recently, various transverse kinematic studies were performed exploring momentum conservation in the plane perpendicular to the neutrino momentum vector [14]. In our computations we use also information from momentum conservation along the neutrino momentum vector. The obtained values of neutron momentum and neutrino energy should be almost exact for events from category (i). For the events from category (ii), the spread of the obtained values depends on the severity of the rescatterings experienced by the proton. For events from categories (iii) and (iv), our procedure is expected to produce largely random numbers. This is because the very assumption that the CCQE nteraction occurred on a neutron is not satisfied and the interaction mechanism is more complicated. This is confirmed by MC simulations. Appropriate cuts will be able to eliminate most of them.",

The target neutron momenta and separation energies can be realistically described by means of a spectral function (SF) [15]. The neutron momentum distribution consists of two parts: a mean field part dominating for p < 250 MeV/c and a correlation part responsible for the high momentum tail p > 250 MeV/c [16]. The mean field part can be understood in the language of the shell model [17]. The correlation part comes from short range correlated pairs. In the few GeV neutrino energy region the vast majority of CCQE events come from interactions on neutrons described by the mean field. Our selection aims to select those events by requiring a reconstructed neutron momentum of the order of \u223c 250 MeV/c. In our computations we will have to estimate, on an event by event basis, the excitation energy of the remnant nucleus after a proton was knocked out. The estimation will be consistent with the assumption that we select mean field neutrons. Relevant information will be given in terms of removal energy from neutron energy levels.",

            "text": "In this section, we discuss the performance of the proposed method to select a high CCQE purity sample from a sample of CC0\u03c01p events. We did many tests with a variety of fluxes, targets and MC event generators. In all the examples we investigated the conclusions were similar. Table III shows basic information about all the simulations that were tested. We select charged current events with no mesons and exactly one proton above the assumed detection threshold with the MiniBooNE, NuMI and T2K \u03bd \u00b5 fluxes. The targets we consider are carbon and argon. In the case of carbon, the proton threshold is taken to be 400 MeV/c. In the case of argon, there is more flexibility on how to define the one muon and one proton event sample. We considered two options: either a proton threshold at 400 MeV/c to allow for comparisons with carbon, or 200 MeV/c which is the lowest threshold one can expect to achieve in experiments such as Mi-croBooNE. We employ three different nuclear models -Fermi Gas (FG), Local Fermi Gas (LFG), and Spectral Function (SF). In all cases, protons below threshold are assumed to be undetectable. In the Table III the sixth column shows what fraction of CC events meet these initial CC0\u03c01p criteria. In the last column the CCQE purity in the sample is shown. Differences seen in Table III for the same target and flux express a level of uncertainty in the models. For example in the case of the MB flux and carbon target the overall fraction according to GENIE is only \u223c 30% while according to NEUT and GENIE it is much larger, about 40%. This is because GENIE predicts a lower average proton momentum and fewer events pass the 400 MeV/c threshold. As for the CCQE purity, the NuWro results (lower purity) are probably more reliable because MEC events are included in the simulation. Fermi gas/SF differences can be explained by the fact that SF predicts a smaller CCQE cross section [38]. For the T2K flux, numbers are similar to MB, while for the NuMI flux with an average energy of \u223c 3 GeV there are many more inelastic events, typically with many pions, so the subsample of events with no mesons and only one visible proton is much smaller.",

For these events, the neutrino energy can be accurately reconstructed with far less concern for missing energy. Fig. 5 shows the difference between the true and reconstructed neutrino energy for a sample of CC0\u03c01p events discussed in this paper, using our method (Eq. 12) with and without a cut on the reconstructed neutron momentum of 300 MeV/c. The cut removes most of events with poorly reconstructed neutrino energy, leaving a sample of events with neutrino energies reconstructed within 100 MeV of the true neutrino energy, with well over 90% of events energies reconstructed to better than 40 MeV of the true energy. Characteristic shapes seen in Fig. 5 come from the probability distribution for neutron binding energy. They are present because in the simulations the Fermi gas model was used with no information about neutron energy levels. Of course, in a real experimental situation the structures will likely be washed out by detector smearing effects.  It is interesting to observe that FSI tends to lower the energy of final state particles, leading to the appearance of a tail of events being reconstructed with the energy often much smaller than the true one. Placing a cut at 300 MeV/c reconstructed neutron momentum reduces this tail significantly.",
