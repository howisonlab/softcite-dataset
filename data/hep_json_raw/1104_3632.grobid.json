The standard model (SM) of charged electroweak interactions assumes maximal parity violation based on empirical evidence. However, SM extensions with additional weak couplings can restore parity conservation at higher energies, and precision studies of muon decay are a method of probing such extensions. Within the SM, positive muons decay to a positron and two neutrinos via left-handed couplings to the W-boson. For muons that originate from pion decay, the forward-backward asymmetry of the positron from muon decay can be described by P",

A positive pion at rest decays into a muon and neutrino, each of momentum 29:79 MeV=c. In this frame, muons have 100% negative helicity in the SM, except for the radiative decay mode of the pion and the finite mass of the muon neutrino, which change the helicity at the level of 10 \u00c05 (negligible for our purposes). The M13 beam line ( Fig. 1) was tuned to select particles at 29:60 MeV=c, which included muons from pion decay at rest in a thin outer layer of the graphite target. These are known as surface muons since they originate near the surface of the graphite target [13].

This minimized multiple Coulomb scattering (MCS), which degraded the TEC resolution and also the muon polarization. Despite these efforts, MCS meant that the TECs could not remain in place during normal data acquisition. The modules were typically inserted on a weekly basis, at the beginning and end of each data set (during which the beam line settings were not altered), for approximately 1 hour of beam measurements.

The TEC sense planes lost efficiency with time, and in our previous P measurement [8] the average number of points per track dropped to just four. This aging effect was eliminated by regularly changing the TEC sense planes after several hours of exposure to the beam. Muons passed from the final beam line quadrupole through an extension of the beam line vacuum system into the TWIST spectrometer, consisting of a superconducting solenoid in an iron yoke with an array of high precision position-sensitive planar detectors within the room-temperature bore of the solenoid. The vacuum extension was part of an upstream beam package, which also included a Mylar vacuum window, a variable density gas degrader, an adjustable foil degrader, a thin muon scintillator, and a scintillator to detect decay positrons. The variable density gas degrader volume was a 20 cm length of CO 2 and He at atmospheric pressure contained between the 100 m vacuum window on one side and a 6 m Mylar membrane on the other. Natural variations in external pressure and temperature caused the gas density within the TWIST spectrometer to change, but the muon stopping position was kept constant by a feedback loop that changed the ratio of CO 2 and He and thus the density of the gas degrader. The foil degrader could be used to place up to 0.1 cm of Mylar in the path of the muons, but it was typically set for zero thickness. The muon scintillator was a plastic disc of radius 3.0 cm and thickness 239 m, providing a trigger to the data acquisition signaling the arrival of a muon in the spectrometer. It was surrounded by an annular scintillator (inner radius 3.0 cm, outer radius 18.5 cm) that detected positrons decaying in the upstream direction. After the upstream beam package, the muons entered the TWIST detector array ( Fig. 3) and about 80% stopped in a thin metal foil at its center. A set of scintillators was added at the downstream end of the detector to provide reliable timing information for all downstream decay positrons. For one week of data taking, a downstream beam package was added that mirrored the upstream beam package, except that the muon and positron scintillators were inactive; its purpose was to study the effect of backscattered positrons.",

The beam positrons originated from muon decays within the production target and surrounding materials, as well as from gamma conversions in the region of the production target.

Because of the 10 m length of the M13 beam line, pions at the selected beam momentum \u00f029:60 MeV=c\u00de arrived approximately 170 ns after production by a proton in the graphite target. Muons left the target with a time distribution governed by the 26 ns lifetime of the pion at rest in the target, and then took about 130 ns to reach the detector. Pions thus arrived almost one full accelerator repetition period after the earliest surface muons. A contamination of cloud muons was also present; these originated from pions decaying in flight while moving between the production target and the first dipole (B1). They arrived at the same time as the earliest surface muons, but they had a small, opposite, and poorly determined polarization. The difference in polarization for the cloud muon time region is clear from the forward-backward asymmetry.

For the measurements reported here, quadrupole steering was added by installing current sources that could be used to increase the field in individual pole pieces of three of the M13 quadrupoles (Q4, Q6, and Q7). When an asymmetric current was applied to the poles, a dipole field was added that shifted the zero field location away from the quadrupole center.

The angles were drawn from independent Gaussian distributions with a mean angle that matched the data measurement for the particular \u00f0x; y\u00de bin. The widths of the Gaussian angle distributions measured by the TECs were systematically too large due to MCS in the drift gas and windows. In order to correct for the MCS, the observed widths were multiplied by 0.64 in the x-module and 0.48 in the y-module. The multiplication factors were determined by simulating the TECs in GEANT and adjusting the factors until the distributions from the simulated TECs reproduced the data.

The longitudinal momentum cut (jp min z j \u00bc 14:0 MeV=c) avoided the region where the helix wavelength was difficult to determine. The requirement j cosj < 0:96 removed small angle tracks where the wavelength was poorly resolved, and j cosj > 0:54 eliminated large angle tracks with less reliable reconstruction due to MCS as the path length through the chambers became too large. The maximum transverse momentum cut (p max t \u00bc 38:0 MeV=c) retained only the positrons within the instrumented regions of the detector. The minimum transverse momentum cut (p min t \u00bc 10:0 MeV=c) removed tracks where the helix radius became comparable to the wire spacing. After all cuts, between 4% and 6% of original events remained in the spectrum (see Table I). An iterative momentum calibration was applied while determining the difference in decay parameters between data and simulation. The calibration used the highmomentum portion of the spectrum that straddled the kinematic momentum end point (Fig. 8), where on average the simulation's reconstructed momentum was larger than in the data by $0:01 MeV=c. The difference between the data and simulation was found for bins in 1= cos, and these differences are fitted separately upstream and downstream to a slope (a) and an intercept (b) at cos \u00bc 0. We bring the data and simulation into agreement by applying two calibration models to the data spectrum. An error in the magnetic field scale would mostly contribute a momentum scaling, so the first calibration model scaled the data using",

This level of error had a negligible effect on the final polarization.

There were limitations in the finite element analysis that affected the accuracy of modeling the transverse field components. For example, the magnetic field calculations did not include the reinforcing steel bars in the floor of the experimental hall, and details of the solenoid's coils (position and current density) could only be tuned using the B z components. Additionally, it is reasonable to expect that the finite element analysis had inaccuracies when reproducing the iron-air interface around the yoke hole (z % \u00c0150 cm), where there are sharp features with length characteristics on a scale of $0:1 cm. The last beam line quadrupoles Q6 and Q7 were not included in the map used for the analysis, but a separate OPERA study confirmed that the distortion of the solenoid fringe field due to the iron of these magnets had a negligible effect on the beam polarization.",

IV, the muon beam for these data sets had significantly reduced polarization compared to the nominal beam. In Table III the reductions in polarization from data and simulation are listed. The simulation underestimates the reduction by 2:0 and 0:6 for sets 74 compared with 76, and 87 compared with 86, respectively. It overestimates the reduction by 1:0 for sets 74 and 72. We presume that the 2:0 difference for set 74 compared to 76 has its origins in the simulation of the depolarization or the quality of the OPERA field map. The agreement between data and simulation for the three entries from Table III was quantified as a function of scaled transverse components relative to their OPERA values, using a weighted squared difference statistic similar to chi-squared minimization [27]. The best agreement was found for an increase of 10%. Simulations with these values of transverse field components yielded an average reduction in polarization of 13:9 \u00c2 10 \u00c04 . An independent approach of adding fields from three extra on-axis coils to almost completely eliminate the mismatch between the measured B z component and the OPERA map gave a consistent value for the depolarization.

These uncorrelated effects were added in quadrature to give a systematic uncertainty in P from chamber response of AE2:3 \u00c2 10 \u00c04 .

Uncertainties in the external information lead to a total P uncertainty of AE1:2 \u00c2 10 \u00c04 . Because the spectrum in the fiducial region was smooth and varied very slowly in momentum and angle, the decay parameters were insensitive to a difference in resolution between data and simulation. Only at the sharp end point could a difference in momentum resolution be detected, and no significant difference was observed. An analysis [12] of sets 73 and 80 where the muons were stopped at the entrance of the detector together with matching simulations yielded a comparison of the resolutions for momentum and angle. The difference between data and simulation results in a conservative uncertainty for P of AE1:5 \u00c2 10 \u00c04 . TABLE IV.

The systematic uncertainty for positron interactions included a contribution due to materials external to the tracking volume that were absent from the simulation (e.g., tracks were not simulated inside the iron yoke), leading to an uncertainty in P of AE0:4 \u00c2 10 \u00c04 due to missing backscattered decay positrons. There were two other contributions to the positron interactions' uncertainty from the simulation of bremsstrahlung and delta-electron production. The rates for these two processes in the simulation were compared to data by selecting positron trajectories that were identified by the reconstruction software as two distinct segments, corresponding to an event where a discrete energy loss or scattering process took place. By comparing the energy difference between the two track segments [12], the bremsstrahlung rate in data for energy loss between 15 and 35 MeV=c was found to be greater than the simulation by \u00f02:4 AE 0:4\u00de%, leading to targetdependent uncertainties of AE0:5 \u00c2 10 \u00c04 for Ag and AE0:3 \u00c2 10 \u00c04 for Al. The delta-electron rate was measured by selecting tracks that were broken into two segments, with a third segment from an additional negatively charged track that originated from the break point as a deltaelectron candidate. The candidates were reconstructed if their momentum exceeded $6 MeV=c. The simulation matched the data for the yield of delta-electrons at the level of \u00f0\u00c00:7 AE 0:9\u00de%, resulting in a systematic uncertainty of AE0:1 \u00c2 10 \u00c04 .",

(16) and (17). The uncertainties are the quadratic sum of statistical errors from the fits and setdependent statistical uncertainties from the momentum calibration. The correlation coefficients for the fits are given in Table VI. There were four corrections made to \u00c1P before unblinding the result. The first one corrected for muon depolarization inside the graphite production target, which was not in the simulation. For nominal beam settings, muons were selected from pion decays at an average depth of 16 m from the surface of the production target. While exiting the target, MCS changed the muons' momentum vectors but not the spin vectors, so that the spin and momentum were no longer exactly antiparallel. A correction to \u00c1P of \u00fe0:9 \u00c2 10 \u00c04 was required for the nominal data sets, \u00fe5:9 \u00c2 10 \u00c04 for a beam momentum of 28:75 MeV=c, and \u00fe5:2 \u00c2 10 \u00c04 for a beam momentum of 28:85 MeV=c. Within the M13 beam line the muons experienced magnetic fields. Because of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, there is a difference in the rotation frequency of the momentum vector and the precession frequency of the spin vector that can change the angle between them. This reduction in polarization is negligible (P changes at the level of $10 \u00c08 ). The second correction accounted for the differences between preliminary and final values. These were \u00fe2:9 \u00c2 10 \u00c04 for the Ag target and \u00fe2:4 \u00c2 10 \u00c04 for Al. Two additional corrections arose because for each data set we generated a simulation with more events than the data, by a factor of between 1.8 and 4.0. This imbalance in statistics introduced a small bias [12] when fitting data to simulation spectra, requiring a set-independent correction of \u00c00:5 \u00c2 10 \u00c04 . The statistics imbalance also introduced Correlation coefficients from (a) the fits of data to simulation, (b) average correlations for the systematic uncertainties common to , , and P , and (c) correlations for the final result, which are used for the calculation of the errors on P =. The ''\u00fe'' and ''\u00c0'' labels indicate correlations for the asymmetric errors. a bias in the momentum calibration, requiring a setdependent correction of between \u00fe1:3 \u00c2 10 \u00c04 and \u00fe2:3 \u00c2 10 \u00c04 . Our final P result did not use sets 72, 76, and 86 since their systematic uncertainties for the polarization were not understood sufficiently well. Sets 70 and 71 were also excluded because of unevaluated fringe-field uncertainties; the fringe field was not measured at 1.96 T, 2.04 T, and the maps were not calculated with OPERA.",

The sensitivity of to nonpolarization systematics is typically small. A reduction of the measured P = by as much as 0.0019 due to an error in simulating the change of polarization would require an increase in the simulated value of P by the same amount. In the simulation, the difference of P from 1.0 is dominated by fringe-field effects of about 0.0025 (Fig. 9). We consider it unlikely that this difference could be overestimated by several times the entire positive systematic uncertainty of \u00c1P (Table II), as would be required to explain our value of P =. No significant mistakes were found in the estimates of the systematic uncertainties previously considered. However, we did find that two corrections had been missed. A correction of 0:3 \u00c2 10 \u00c04 for muon radiative decay was added for the Ag data due to photons converting in the target. This correction was negligible for Al. A second correction was made for each data set to account for effects in the analysis of a difference between the mean muon stopping position for data and simulation.

The lower mass limit for W 2 (\u00f0g L =g R \u00dem 2 ) has been increased from 400 GeV=c 2 to 578 GeV=c 2 . Note that these limits make no assumptions about a possible difference of CKM couplings in the left-and right-handed sectors; any values are allowed. Neither is any assumption necessary regarding the possible presence of CP-violating phases in the LRS model. Compared with other methods of placing bounds for mass and mixing angle in the generalized LRS model [35], this is a distinct and unique advantage of muon decay where the strong interaction effects are absent in lowest order, except for a small contribution from the polarization of muons resulting from pion decay. As such, our limits represent the most restrictive available on mass and mixing in the generalized LRS model, subject only to the qualification of a light right-handed neutrino.",

While it was understood that systematic issues would dominate precision for all measured muon decay parameters, the challenges presented for P were quite different from those of or . The result could not have been achieved without several cycles of measurement and analysis that stretched over nearly a decade. The early phases of the program showed where the main difficulties would be; while they were mostly anticipated, the early experiences allowed us to test methods to improve beam quality and characterization as well as methods of evaluation of systematic uncertainties. The result shown in Eq. (18) quantifies parity violation in muon decay with a precision that is a factor of 7 improvement over prior experiments, setting new limits on possible mass and mixing angle combinations in a generalized (nonmanifest) left-right symmetric model.",
