In a sample of 27 617 B 0 s ! J=c K \u00fe K \u00c0 decays, where the dominant contribution comes from B 0 s !

In the Standard Model (SM), for b ! c \" cs transitions and ignoring subleading penguin contributions, this phase is predicted to be \u00c02 s , where s \u00bc arg \u00f0\u00c0V ts V \u00c3 tb =V cs V \u00c3 cb \u00de and V ij are elements of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa quark flavor mixing matrix [1]. The indirect determination via global fits to experimental data gives 2 s \u00bc 0:0364 AE 0:0016 rad [2]. This precise indirect determination within the SM makes the measurement of s interesting since new physics processes could modify the phase if new particles were to contribute to the B 0 s -\" B 0 s box diagrams [3,4] shown in Fig. 1. Direct measurements of s using B 0 s ! J=c and B 0 s ! J=c \u00fe \u00c0 decays have been reported previously. In the B 0 s ! J=c channel, the decay width difference of the light (L) and heavy (H) B 0 s mass eigenstates, \u00c1\u00c0 s \u00c0 L \u00c0 \u00c0 H , and the average B 0 s -decay width, \u00c0 s \u00bc \u00f0\u00c0 L \u00fe \u00c0 H \u00de=2, are also measured.

            "text": "This paper extends previous LHCb measurements in the B 0 s ! J=c [5] and B 0 s ! J=c \u00fe \u00c0 [6] channels. In the previous analysis of B 0 s ! J=c decays, the invariant mass of the K \u00fe K \u00c0 system was limited to AE12 MeV=c 2 around the \u00f01020\u00de mass [11], which selected predominately resonant P-wave ! K \u00fe K \u00c0 events, although a small S-wave K \u00fe K \u00c0 component was also present. In this analysis the K \u00fe K \u00c0 mass range is extended to AE30 MeV=c 2 , and the notation B 0 s ! J=c K \u00fe K \u00c0 is used to include explicitly both P-and S-wave decays [12]. In both channels additional same-side flavor-tagging information is used. The data were obtained from pp collisions collected by the LHCb experiment at a centerof-mass energy of 7 TeV during 2011, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1:0 fb \u00c01 . This paper is organized as follows. Section II presents the phenomenological aspects related to the measurement. Section III presents the LHCb detector. In Sec. IV the selection of B 0 s ! J=c K \u00fe K \u00c0 candidates is described. Section V deals with decay-time resolution, Sec. VI deals with the decay-time and angular acceptance effects, and Sec. VII deals with flavor tagging. The maximum likelihood fit is explained in Sec. VIII. The results and systematic uncertainties for the B 0 s ! J=c K \u00fe K \u00c0 channel are given in Secs. IX and X, the results for the B 0 s ! J=c \u00fe \u00c0 channel are given in Sec. XI, and finally the combined results are presented in Sec. XII. Charge conjugation is implied throughout the paper.",

The combined tracking system has momentum resolution \u00c1p=p that varies from 0.4% at 5 GeV=c to 0.6% at 100 GeV=c and an impact parameter resolution of 20 m for tracks with high transverse momentum. Charged hadrons are identified using two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors [23]. Photon, electron, and hadron candidates are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter, and a hadronic calorimeter.

Events are first required to pass a hardware trigger [24], which selects events containing muon or hadron candidates with a high transverse momentum (p T ). The subsequent software trigger [24] is composed of two stages, the first of which performs a partial event reconstruction. Two types of first-stage software triggers are employed. For the first type, events are required to have two well-identified oppositely-charged muons with invariant mass larger than 2:7 GeV=c 2 . This trigger has an almost uniform acceptance as a function of decay time and will be referred to as unbiased. For the second type, there must be at least one muon (one high-p T track) with a transverse momentum larger than 1 GeV=c (1:7 GeV=c) and an impact parameter larger than 100 m with respect to the primary vertex (PV). This trigger introduces a nontrivial acceptance as a function of decay time and will be referred to as biased. The second stage of the trigger performs a full event reconstruction and only retains events containing a \u00fe \u00c0 pair with invariant mass within 120 MeV=c 2 of the J=c mass [11] and that form a vertex that is significantly displaced from the PV, introducing another small decay-time biasing effect. The final B 0 s candidate selection is performed by applying kinematic and particle identification criteria to the final-state tracks. The J=c meson candidates are formed from two oppositely-charged particles, originating from a common vertex, which have been identified as muons and which have p T larger than 500 MeV=c. The invariant mass of the \u00fe \u00c0 pair, m\u00f0 \u00fe \u00c0 \u00de, must be in the range \u00bd3030; 3150 MeV=c 2 . During subsequent steps of the selection, m\u00f0 \u00fe \u00c0 \u00de is constrained to the J=c mass [11].",

The decay time, t, of the B 0 s candidate is calculated from a vertex and kinematic fit that constrains the B 0 s ! J=c K \u00fe K \u00c0 candidate to originate from its associated PV [31]. The 2 of the fit (which has 7 degrees of freedom) is required to be less than 35. Multiple B 0 s candidates are found in less than 1% of events; in these cases the candidate with the smallest 2 is chosen. B 0 s candidates are required to have decay time in the range [0.3, 14.0] ps; the lower bound on the decay time suppresses a large fraction of the prompt combinatorial background while having a negligible effect on the sensitivity to s . The kinematic fit evaluates an estimated decay-time uncertainty, t . Candidates with t larger than 0.12 ps are removed from the event sample. Figure 4 shows the m\u00f0J=c K \u00fe K \u00c0 \u00de distribution for events originating from both the unbiased and biased triggers, along with corresponding projection of an unbinned maximum log-likelihood fit to the sample.

In total, after the trigger and full offline selection requirements, there are 27 617 AE 115 B 0 s ! J=c K \u00fe K \u00c0 signal events found by the fit. Of these, 23 502 AE 107 were selected by the unbiased trigger, and 4115 AE 43 were exclusively selected by the biased trigger. The uncertainties quoted here come from propagating the uncertainty on the signal fraction evaluated by the fit. Figure 5 shows the invariant mass of the \u00fe \u00c0 and K \u00fe K \u00c0 pairs satisfying the selection requirements.

The SSK tagging algorithm was developed using large samples of simulated B 0 s decays to D \u00c0 s \u00fe and J=c and is documented in Ref. [37]. The algorithm preferentially selects kaons originating from the fragmentation of the signal B 0 s meson and rejects particles that originate either from the opposite-side B decay or the underlying event. For the optimization, approximately 26,000 B 0 s ! D \u00c0 s \u00fe data events are used.

These terms are required to account for an averaging effect resulting from the variation within each bin of the S-wave line shape (assumed to be approximately uniform) relative to that of the P-wave (a relativistic Breit-Wigner function).
