The analysed data, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb \u22121 , were collected in proton-proton collisions in Run 2 of the Large Hadron Collider at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. Final states containing zero, one and two charged leptons (electrons or muons) are considered, targeting the decays Z \u2192 \u03bd\u03bd, W \u2192 \u03bd and Z \u2192 . For a Higgs boson mass of 125 GeV, an excess of events over the expected background from other Standard Model processes is found with an observed significance of 3.5 standard deviations, compared to an expectation of 3.0 standard deviations. This excess provides evidence for the Higgs boson decay into b-quarks and for its production in association with a vector boson. The combination of this result with that of the Run 1 analysis yields a ratio of the measured signal events to the Standard Model expectation equal to 0.90 \u00b1 0.18(stat.) +0.21   \u22120.19 (syst.). Assuming the Standard Model production cross-section, the results are consistent with the value of the Yukawa coupling to b-quarks in the Standard Model.",

            "text": "Introduction The Higgs boson, predicted more than 50 years ago [1][2][3][4], was discovered in 2012 by the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations [5,6], analysing the results of proton-proton (pp) collisions produced by the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) [7]. The properties of the discovered particle have been measured using the Run 1 dataset, collected at centre-of-mass energies of 7 TeV and 8 TeV, and were found to be compatible with those predicted by the Standard Model (SM) within uncertainties, typically of the order of \u00b120% [8][9][10][11]. The Run 2 dataset at an energy of 13 TeV provides an opportunity to increase the precision of such measurements, and to challenge theory predictions further. While analyses of Higgs bosons decaying into vector bosons are entering an era of detailed differential measurements, direct evidence for the coupling of the Higgs boson to fermions was established only via the observation of the decay into \u03c4 -leptons through the combination of ATLAS and CMS Run 1 results [11], and, more recently, through the combination of CMS Run 1 and Run 2 results [12]. Although the gluon-gluon fusion production mode provides indirect evidence for the coupling of the Higgs boson to top quarks, there is currently no direct observation of the coupling of the Higgs boson to quarks.",

Accessing H \u2192 bb decays is therefore crucial for constraining, under fairly general assumptions [14,15], the overall Higgs boson decay width. At the LHC, the very large backgrounds arising from multi-jet production make an inclusive search extremely challenging. The most sensitive production modes for probing H \u2192 bb decays are those where the Higgs boson is produced in association with a W or Z boson [16]; their leptonic decay modes lead to clean signatures that can be efficiently triggered on, while rejecting most of the multi-jet backgrounds.",

The respective analysis categories that target these decay modes are referred to as the 0-, 1-and 2-lepton channels, based on the number of selected charged leptons. In this article, the term \"lepton\", unless modified by a qualifier, refers to electron and muon. A b-tagging algorithm is used to identify the jets consistent with originating from a H \u2192 bb decay. In order to maximise the sensitivity to the Higgs boson signal, a set of observables encoding information about event kinematics and topology is combined into a multivariate discriminant. A binned maximum-likelihood fit, referred to as the global likelihood fit, is applied to data simultaneously across the three channels in multiple analysis regions. The likelihood fit uses the multivariate discriminant as the main fit observable, in order to extract the signal yield and normalisations of the main backgrounds. The signal extraction method is validated with two other analyses: the dijet-mass analysis, where the signal yield is extracted using the mass of the dijet system of b-tagged jets as the main fit observable, and the diboson analysis, where the nominal multivariate analysis is modified to extract the (W/Z)Z diboson process, with the Z boson decaying into bb. The combination of the results of the Higgs boson search with those of the previously published analysis of the Run 1 dataset [18] is also presented.",

The contribution from gg \u2192 ZH (gluon-induced) production was simulated using the leading-order (LO) Powheg-Box v2 matrix-element generator. An additional scale factor is applied to the qq \u2192 V H processes as a function of the vector boson's transverse momentum to account for electroweak (EW) corrections at NLO. This makes use of the V H differential cross-section computed with Hawk [72,73]. The samples of simulated events include all final states where the Higgs boson decays into bb and the vector boson to a leptonic final state, including those with a \u03c4 -lepton. The analysis has only a small acceptance for other Higgs boson production and decay modes which are therefore neglected. The mass of the Higgs boson was fixed at 125 GeV and the H \u2192 bb branching fraction was fixed at 58%. The inclusive pp \u2192 V H cross-sections [44][45][46][47][48][49][50] were calculated at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) (QCD) and JHEP12(2017)024 NLO (EW). Electroweak corrections include the photon-induced contributions, which are of the order of 5% for the W H \u2192 \u03bdbb process and 1% for the ZH \u2192 bb process. For the gluon-induced ZH production, the cross-section is calculated at next-to-leading order and next-to-leading-logarithm accuracy (NLO+NLL) in QCD [51][52][53][54][55]. This is then subtracted from the inclusive pp \u2192 ZH production cross-section to estimate the quarkinduced contribution to the cross-section.",

All muon candidates are required to have p T > 7 GeV, and not to be matched to an inner detector track that is likely to arise from a non-prompt muon or from pileup, by applying impact parameter requirements similar to those for the electron selection: |IP r\u03c6 |/\u03c3 IP r\u03c6 < 3 and |IP z | < 0.5 mm.

A significantly improved algorithm, which also profits from the addition of the IBL detector, was developed for Run 2 [89]. At the chosen working point, the improved algorithm provides nominal light-flavour (u,d,s-quark and gluon) and c-jet misidentification efficiencies of 0.3% and 8.2%, respectively, for an average 70% b-jet tagging efficiency, as estimated from simulated tt events for jets with p T > 20 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.5. The flavour tagging efficiencies in simulation are corrected separately for b-, c-and light-flavour jets, based on the respective data-based calibration analyses. The ratio of the efficiencies in data and simulation is close to unity for b-jets, while more significant corrections are needed for c-and light-flavour jets, up to \u2248 1.4 and \u2248 2, respectively.",

The combination of processes with large production cross-section and small selection efficiencies can make the production of samples exceeding the integrated luminosity of the data challenging. For cases where the small selection efficiency is due to the high rejection achieved by the application of b-tagging, a method called parameterised tagging is applied. Unlike when explicitly applying the b-tagging algorithm (direct tagging), in parameterised tagging all jets are kept but the event is weighted by the expected probability for a jet with a certain flavour label (b, c or light) to be tagged as a b-jet. These probabilities are parameterised as a function of jet kinematics (p T and \u03b7) based on JHEP12(2017)024 a large sample of simulated tt events.

The muon-in-jet correction is applied when a medium quality muon with p T > 5 GeV is found within \u2206R = 0.4 of a jet, to account for the presence of b-and c-hadron decays into muons which do not deposit their full energy in the calorimeter. Unlike in the lepton selection introduced previously, no isolation criteria are applied on such muons. When more than one muon is found, the one closest to the jet axis is chosen. The muon fourmomentum is added to that of the jet, and the energy deposited by the muon in the calorimeter is removed. To further improve the jet response, a second correction, denoted PtReco, is applied as a function of jet p T . This correction is derived separately for jets with or without a lepton (muon or electron) found within \u2206R = 0.4 of the jet axis, and it is based on the residual difference in jet response expected from the signal simulation between the reconstructed b-jets (with all corrections previously applied) and the corresponding truth jets (formed by clustering final-state particles taken from the Monte Carlo truth record, including muons and neutrinos). For jets without a matching lepton, the PtReco correction increases the energy of jets with p T \u223c 20 GeV by 12% and the energy of those with p T > 100 GeV by 1%, while a larger correction is observed for jets matched to a lepton, due to the missing neutrino energy.",

The lowest-threshold trigger in 2016 includes isolation and identification requirements that are looser than any of the isolation and identification requirements applied in the analysis. These requirements are removed or relaxed for the higher-threshold triggers. The muon sub-channel uses the same E miss T triggers as the 0-lepton channel. Since muons are not included in the E miss T calculation at trigger level, in events where a muon is present this trigger is in effect selecting events based on p V T , and is therefore fully efficient for values of p V T above 180 GeV. This trigger is preferred because it has an overall signal efficiency (with respect to the offline selection) of 98%, compared to \u223c 80% efficiency for the combination of single-muon triggers, which is due to the limited muon trigger chamber coverage in the central |\u03b7| region of the detector. Events are required to contain exactly one tight electron with p T above 27 GeV (electron JHEP12(2017)024 sub-channel) or one medium muon with p T above 25 GeV (muon sub-channel), and no additional loose leptons. In the electron sub-channel, where multi-jet production is a significant background, an additional selection of E miss T > 30 GeV is applied. Control regions enhanced in the W + HF background are defined for both the 2-and 3-jet categories. These are obtained by applying two additional selection requirements beyond the respective nominal selection criteria: m bb < 75 GeV and m top > 225 GeV. To calculate the reconstructed top quark mass, m top , an estimate of the four-momentum of the neutrino from the W boson decay is required. The vector E miss T is assumed to give an estimate of the neutrino's transverse momentum components and then p \u03bd z can be determined up to a possible two-fold ambiguity by constraining the mass of the leptonplus-neutrino system to be the W boson mass. 4 The top quark is then reconstructed by considering the reconstructed W boson and one of the two b-tagged jets. The combination of b-tagged jet and p \u03bd z minimising m top is selected. The requirement on the reconstructed top quark mass significantly reduces the contamination from tt and single-top-quark events in the W + HF CRs. The events in the control regions are removed from the corresponding signal regions. In the W + HF CRs, between 75% and 78% of the events are expected to be from W + HF production.",

Starting from the dijet mass (m bb ), additional variables describing the event kinematics and topology are tried one at a time and the one yielding the best separation gain is added to the list. This procedure is repeated until adding more variables results in a negligible performance gain. The Toolkit for Multivariate Data Analysis, TMVA [96], is used to train the BDTs, with values of the training parameters similar to those described in ref. [18]. In order to make use of the complete set of simulated MC events for the BDT training and evaluation in an unbiased way, the MC events are split into two samples of equal size, A and B. The performance of the BDTs trained on sample A (B) is evaluated with sample B (A) in order to avoid using identical events for both training and evaluation of the same BDT. Half of the data are analysed with the BDTs trained on sample A, and the other half with the BDTs trained on sample B. At the end, the output distributions of the BDTs trained on samples A and B are merged for both the simulated and data events. This procedure allows a reduction of the uncertainty due to the limited size of the MC samples by a factor of \u221a 2. A dedicated procedure is applied to transform the BDT output distributions to obtain a smoother distribution for the background processes and finer binning in the regions with the largest signal contribution, whilst ensuring that the statistical uncertainty of the simulated background is less than 20% in each bin. The binning procedure is described in more detail in ref. [18].",

The b-tagging simulation-to-data efficiency correction factors are derived [88] separately for b-jets, c-jets and light-flavour jets. All three correction factors depend on jet p T (or p T and |\u03b7|) and have uncertainties estimated from multiple sources. These are decomposed into uncorrelated components which are then treated independently, resulting in three uncertainties for b-jets and for c-jets, and five for light-flavour jets. The approximate size of the uncertainty in the tagging efficiency is 2% for b-jets, 10% for c-jets and 30% for light jets. Additional uncertainties are considered in the extrapolation of the b-jet efficiency calibration above p T = 300 GeV and in the misidentification of hadronically decaying \u03c4 -leptons as b-jets. The uncertainties in the jet energy scale and resolution are based on their respective measurements in data [84,97]. The many sources of uncertainty in the jet energy scale correction are decomposed into 21 uncorrelated components which are treated as independent. An additional specific uncertainty is considered that affects the energy calibration of b-and c-jets.",

The uncertainties in the energy scale and resolution of the jets and leptons are propagated to the calculation of E miss T , which also has additional uncertainties from the scale, resolution and efficiency of the tracks used to define the soft term [94], along with the modelling of the underlying event. An uncertainty is assigned to the simulation-to-data E miss T trigger scale factors to account for the statistical uncertainty in the measured scale factors and differences between the scale factors determined from W + jets and tt events. The uncertainty in the luminosity is 2.1% for the 2015 data and 3.4% for the 2016 data, resulting in an uncertainty of 3.2% for the combined dataset. It is derived, following a methodology similar to that detailed in ref. [29], from a preliminary calibration of the luminosity scale using x-y beam-separation scans performed in 2015 and 2016. The average number of interactions per bunch crossing is rescaled by 9% to improve the agreement between simulation with data, based on the measurement of the visible cross section in minimum-bias events [98], and an uncertainty, as large as the correction, is included.",

These uncertainties are derived either from particle-level comparisons between nominal and alternative samples using the RIVET [99] framework, or from comparisons to data in control regions. The particle-level comparisons are cross-checked with detector-level simulations whenever these are available, and good agreement is found. When acceptance uncertainties are estimated all the nominal and alternative samples are normalised using the same production cross-section. Such uncertainties are estimated by adding the differences between the nominal and alternative samples in quadrature. Shape uncertainties are considered in each of the analysis regions separately, with the samples scaled to have the same normalisation in each region. In this case, the uncertainty is taken from the alternative generator which has the largest shape difference compared to the nominal sample. Shape uncertainties are only derived for the m bb and p V T variables, as it was found that it is sufficient to only consider the changes induced in these variables by an alternative generator to cover the overall shape variation of the BDT V H discriminant. The systematic uncertainties affecting the modelling of the background samples are reported in tables 6 and 7, and the specific details of how the uncertainties are estimated are provided below for each simulated background sample.",

For the 0+1 lepton channels, uncertainties are considered in the normalisation ratios of the 3-jet and 2-jet regions, of the W + HF control region and signal region, and of the 1-lepton and 0-lepton channels.

Given the small contribution from W W production (< 0.1% of the total background) only a normalisation uncertainty is assigned. The more important contributions from the W Z and ZZ backgrounds have uncertainties derived for the overall normalisation, the relative acceptance between regions and for the m bb and p V T shapes. Uncertainties are derived by comparing the nominal sample (Sherpa 2.2.1) to the alternative samples with varied factorisation, renormalisation and resummation scales, and using the Stewart-Tackmann method [104] to estimate scale variation uncertainties for the acceptance in the jet multiplicity categories. Additional uncertainties in the overall acceptance, in the relative acceptance across jet multiplicities and in the shape of the m bb and p V T distributions are estimated in the parton-shower and underlying-event model. These are estimated by considering the difference between Powheg+Pythia8 and Powheg+Herwig++ with the CTEQ6L1-UE-EE-5 tune, as well as changes in the Pythia8 parton-shower tune. The envelope of the two effects is considered to define these uncertainties. A systematic uncertainty in the shape of the m bb distribution results from the comparison of Sherpa 2.2.1 and Powheg+Pythia8. This changes the shape of the m bb distribution for values in the range 100 -130 GeV by 10 -20%. Acceptance uncertainties are derived for the ratio of 0-to-1 lepton channels and for the ratio of the 2-to-3 jet regions for W Z production. In the ZZ production case the acceptance uncertainties are derived for the ratio of the 0-to-2 lepton channels and of the 2-to-3 jet regions. Uncertainties in the acceptance and m bb or p V T shapes of the diboson background due to PDF and \u03b1 S variations were found to have a negligible impact.",

Systematic uncertainties can have an impact on the multi-jet estimates in two ways: either changing the m W T distributions used in the multi-jet template fits, therefore impacting the extracted multi-jet normalisations, or directly changing the multi-jet BDT distributions used in the global likelihood fit. Several sources of uncertainty are considered, uncorrelated between the electron and muon sub-channels. The respective variations are added in quadrature for the normalisations, or considered as separate shape uncertainties. The variations are obtained by changing the definition of the multi-jet control region (2 versus 1 b-tag, more stringent isolation requirements, a different single-electron trigger to probe a potential trigger bias in the isolation requirements); removing the bias correction that makes use of the p T -, \u03b7-, and E miss T -dependent extrapolation factors derived in the (1-jet, 0 b-tag) region; varying the normalisation of the contamination from the top (tt and W t) and V +jets processes in the multi-jet control region. In addition, the following sources of uncertainty that only have an impact on the multi-jet normalisation, are considered: use of the E miss T variable instead of m W T for the multi-jet template fit and, for the electron sub-channel only, the inclusion of the E miss T < 30 GeV region, which significantly enhances the multi-jet contribution in the template fit.

The uncertainties in the overall V H production crosssection from missing higher-order terms in the QCD perturbative expansion are obtained by varying the renormalisation scale \u00b5 R and factorisation scale \u00b5 F independently, from 1/3 to 3 times their original value. The PDF+\u03b1 S uncertainty in the overall V H production cross-section is calculated from the 68% CL interval using the PDF4LHC15 nnlo mc PDF set. The latest recommendations of the LHC Higgs working group [107] do not distinguish between uncertainties in qq \u2192 ZH production and gg \u2192 ZH production. To obtain the scale uncertainties separately for these two processes, it is assumed that the uncertainty in qq \u2192 ZH production is identical to the uncertainty in W H production. The gg \u2192 ZH production uncertainty is then derived such that the sum in quadrature of the qq \u2192 ZH and gg \u2192 ZH production uncertainties (considering their respective production crosssections) amount to the scale uncertainty in the overall ZH production. Since the PDF+\u03b1 S uncertainty is larger for W H production than ZH production, the method used for the scale uncertainty cannot be used for this uncertainty. The PDF+\u03b1 S uncertainty in the gg \u2192 ZH production is taken from previous recommendations [15] and the uncertainty in the qq \u2192 ZH production is taken from the latest recommendation [107].",

The limited size of the MC samples for some simulated background processes in some regions can cause large local fluctuations in templates of systematic variations. When the impact of a systematic variation translates into a reweighting of the nominal template, no statistical fluctuations are expected beyond those already present in the nominal template. This is the case, for instance, for the b-tagging uncertainties. For those, no specific action is taken. On the other hand, when a systematic variation may introduce changes in the events selected, as is the case for instance with the JES uncertainties, additional statistical fluctuations may be introduced, which affect the templates of systematic variations. In such cases, a smoothing procedure is applied to each systematic-variation template in each region. To reduce the complexity of the fit, systematic uncertainties that have a negligible impact on the final results are pruned away, region by region. Studies were performed to verify that the smoothing and pruning procedures do not induce any bias in the result. More details about the smoothing and pruning procedures can be found in ref. [18].

To evaluate the maximum potential effect of these correlations, a \u03c7 2 -combination of the two measurements, the signal strengths from the Run 1 and Run 2 datasets, was performed and studied as a function of different linear correlation coefficients, expressing the degree of correlation between the two measurements.

The results of these fits are shown in figures 4 and 5. The compatibility 5 of the signal strength parameters measured in the three lepton channels is 10%. The W H and ZH production modes are observed with a significance of 2.4 and 2.6 standard deviations, respectively. The linear correlation term between the signal strengths related to the W H and the ZH production modes is 0.6%. Assuming that the observed signal is due to the SM Higgs boson, with corresponding model-dependent extrapolation corrections to the inclusive phase space, the signal strengths can be interpreted as measurements of the W H and ZH production crosssections times the H \u2192 bb branching ratio.

Figure 6 shows the data, background and signal yields, where final-discriminant bins in all regions are combined into bins of log(S/B). Here, S and B are the fitted signal and 5 The compatibility of the signal strength across different analysis regions in the fit is evaluated by repeating the fit with different signal strength parameters assigned to each of such N regions, while keeping the rest of the likelihood definition unchanged. Under the hypothesis that the true underlying signal strength parameter values are the same, the difference in the values of profiled \u22122 ln L between the likelihood fit in the nominal and in the new configuration is expected to be distributed according to a \u03c7 2 distribution with number of degrees of freedom equal to N \u2212 1. The corresponding p-value is thus quoted as a measure of the compatibility. 6 The cross-section for the sum of the W H and ZH production modes is obtained from a fit where both production modes are described by a common signal strength parameter.
