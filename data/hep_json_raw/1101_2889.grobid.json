The ZDC coverage of \u00b1 \u223c 350 \u00b5rad about the forward direction makes possible the measurement of neutral particles (primarily \u03c0 0 's and neutrons) over the kinematic region x F 0.1 and out to p T 1.2 GeV/c at large x F . The ATLAS ZDC is unique in that it provides a complete image of both electromagnetic and hadronic showers. This is illustrated with the reconstruction of \u03c0 0 's with energies of 0.7-3.5 TeV. We also discuss the waveform reconstruction algorithm which has allowed good time-of-flight resolution on leading neutrons emerging from the collisions despite the sparse (40 MHz) sampling of the calorimeter signals used.",

Hence it should be fruitful to identify regimes of central and peripheral collisions where the nature of interactions could differ significantly.

The picture that emerges is that, while a forward baryon is always present in each hemisphere, roughly 40% of the time it is a neutron. To describe the doublydifferential distributions, the simplest assumption is that distributions in the 2 hemispheres are, to good approximation, uncorrelated.

In the case of the ZDC there are a total of 7 sampling points spaced 25 nsec apart so we are not in the limit of perfect sampling. Nevertheless, based on our experience [13] with picosecond timing of fast signals, using Tektronix digital scopes, which implement Eq. 1on-chip, we find that this formula gives the best possible timing resolution for sparse sampling. Therefore, we decided to use this elegant interpolation formula to reconstruct the time and energy of ZDC waveforms [14]. In this paper we also used 1 nsec delay scan data to map the non-linearities in response algorithm, when using our digitization in the ATLAS L1calo preprocessor electronics. The timing performance of the ZDC is illustrated in Fig. 1, where we have merged ZDC data n-tuples with the corresponding ones from the ATLAS inner tracker. In this particular LHC run, there is evidence for \"satellites\" in the beam bunch structure. This is clear from the inner tracker distribution which shows collisions at \u00b175 cm as well as at 0. The projection of this plot onto the horizontal axis, which is the time-of arrival of signals measured in the 1st hadronic module on one side, clearly confirms this structure. In this plot, the non-linearity corrections to ZDC timing, derived in Ref. [14], are intentionally turned off. This plot shows that those corrections could be obtained independently from the satellites, confirming at least a few points of the PHOS4 delay scan. What may be less clear is that Fig. 1 contains a great deal more information about the satellite bunches than could be obtained from the inner tracker distribution by itself. The expected distributions in this plot are derived and animated in a Mathematica notebook [15].",

Later that day he succumbed to a heart attack and ATLAS and ZDC lost an unusually creative detector scientist.
