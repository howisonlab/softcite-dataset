The results are based on a sample of proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV recorded with the CMS detector at the LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.3 fb 1 . Multiple search regions are defined by classifying events in terms of missing transverse momentum, the scalar sum of jet transverse momenta, the transverse mass associated with a W boson candidate, the number of jets, the number of b quark jets, and the transverse momenta of the leptons in the event. The analysis is sensitive to a wide variety of possible signals beyond the standard model. No excess above the standard model background expectation is observed. Constraints are set on various supersymmetric models, with gluinos and bottom squarks excluded for masses up to 1300 and 680 GeV, respectively, at the 95 % confidence level. Upper limits on the cross sections for the production of two top quark-antiquark pairs (119 fb) and two same-sign top quarks (1.7 pb) are also obtained. Selection efficiencies and model independent limits are provided to allow further interpretations of the results.",

Examples of the latter include the production of supersymmetric (SUSY) particles [1,2], Majorana neutrinos [3], vector-like quarks [4], and SS top quark pairs [5,6]. In the SUSY framework [7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15], the SS signature can arise through gluino pair production. For example, the Majorana nature of the gluino allows gluino pairs to decay via SS charginos, yielding two SS W e-mail: cms-publication-committee-chair@cern.ch bosons. Gluino pair production can also yield four W bosons, e.g., from the decay of four top quarks, which may result in the SS dilepton final state. Alternatively, cascade decays of pair-produced squarks can lead to the SS dilepton signature. Searches for new physics in the SS channel have been previously performed at the CERN LHC by the ATLAS [16][17][18] and CMS [19][20][21][22][23] Collaborations.",

The analysis is based on proton-proton (pp) collision data at \u221a s = 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.3 fb \u22121 collected with the CMS detector in 2015. The search strategy resembles that used in our analysis of 19.5 fb 1 of data collected at \u221a s = 8 TeV [23], which excluded gluino masses in the four top quark signature up to about 1050 GeV. We design an inclusive analysis sensitive to a wide range of new-physics processes produced via strong interactions and yielding undetected particles in the final state. The interpretations of the results consider R-parity conserving SUSY models [24], as well as cross section limits on the production of two top quark-antiquark (tt) pairs and of two SS top quarks. We also provide model independent limits to allow further interpretations of the results. With respect to Ref. [23], the kinematic regions are redefined and improvements in the event selection are implemented, both of which increase the sensitivity to new-physics scenarios at \u221a s = 13 TeV.",

The transverse momentum, namely the component of the momentum p in the plane orthogonal to the beam, is defined as p T = p sin \u03b8 . Surrounding the silicon trackers, a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter provide energy measurements of electrons, photons, and hadronic jets in the range |\u03b7| < 3.0. Muons are identified and measured within |\u03b7| < 2.4 by gas-ionization detectors embedded in the steel flux-return yoke of the solenoid. Forward calorimeters on each side of the interaction point encompass 3.0 < |\u03b7| < 5.0. The CMS trigger consists of a two-stage system. The first level of the CMS trigger system, composed of custom hardware processors, uses information from the calorimeters and muon detectors to select events in a fixed time interval of less than 4 \u00b5s. The high-level trigger (HLT) processor farm further decreases the event rate from around 100 kHz to less than 1 kHz, before data storage.

A relaxed selection on the multivariate discriminant is used to define \"loose\" criteria for electron identification.

In the process of defining the search strategy, R-parity conserving SUSY is taken as a guideline because of its rich variety of signatures. In this context, signal models that can lead to the experimental signature of SS lepton pairs differentiate themselves in the numbers of W bosons, b jets, and light-flavor jets produced in the decays of SUSY particles. In addition, the mass differences between the SUSY particles involved in the decay chains affect the energy spectra of the decay products, resulting in differences between the models in the distributions of kinematic quantities such as the p T of the leptons, H T , and E miss T . We consider SUSY scenarios in the context of simplified models of new-particle production [46,47]. Models with four W bosons and four b jets involve gluino pair production, followed by the decay of each gluino through a chain containing third-generation squarks. If the gluino is lighter than all squarks, and the top squark is the lightest squark, the gluino undergoes a three-body decay mediated by an off-shell top squark. If the dominant top squark decay is t 1 \u2192 t \u03c7 0 1 , where \u03c7 0 1 is the lightest neutralino, taken to be the stable, undetected, lightest SUSY particle (LSP), then the gluino threebody decay is g \u2192 tt \u03c7 0 1 (T1tttt model in Fig. 1, upper left). If instead the dominant top squark decay is t 1 \u2192 b \u03c7 + 1 , the gluino three-body decay is g \u2192 tb \u03c7 + 1 (T5ttbbWW model in Fig. 1, upper middle); the latter signature can also arise if the bottom squark is the lightest squark and decays as b 1 \u2192 t \u03c7 \u2212",

The results are shown in comparison to the background prediction. The event yields in the SRs after the full selection are presented in Fig. 3 and in Table 6; no significant deviation from the SM background prediction is observed. The largest local significances are 2.2 and 1.8 standard deviations in HL SR8 and in HH SR10, respectively. The results of the search are used to constrain the benchmark SUSY models presented in Sect. 4. For each mass point in the SUSY particle mass spectrum, results from all SRs are combined to extract cross section exclusion limits at the 95 % confidence level (CL), using the asymptotic formulation of the modified frequentist CL s criterion [51][52][53][54]. Signal and background uncertainties are included as log-normal nuisance parameters and, when relevant, take into account correlation effects among different SRs and/or different processes. Exclusion contours make use of the cross section values calculated at NLO plus next-to-leading logarithmic (NLL) accuracy, assuming that all SUSY particles other than those included in the respective diagram are too heavy to participate in the interaction [55][56][57][58][59][60]. In general, the SR with the largest sensitivity is HH SR31, which requires E miss T > 300 GeV and is inclusive in the other variables. However, depending on the model and the region of parameter space, other SRs contribute significantly to the total sensitivity: for instance, a considerable contribution comes from HL SR25 in case of signal models with a soft lepton, from HH SR32 and HL SR26 in case of high H T , from HH SR3 and SR8 in case of no b jets, and from HH SR24 and SR26 in case of 2 or more b jets.",

For the T1tttt model (Fig. 4-left), in the regions of the SUSY parameter space with a large mass difference between the gluino and the LSP, the results are rather stable with respect to LSP mass variations, and gluino masses up to 1300 GeV are excluded. Near the kinematic threshold m g \u2212 m \u03c7 0 1 = 2(m W + m b ), the gluino mass limit becomes weaker and is reduced to 1050 GeV for an LSP mass of 800 GeV. Results for the T5ttbbWW model with nearly degenerate \u03c7 \u00b1 1 and \u03c7 0 1 masses are shown in Fig. 4-right; the limit on the gluino mass lies in the range 950-1100 GeV except for very small \u03c7 \u00b1 1 and \u03c7 0 1 masses, where the sensitivity increases because of the large Lorentz boost of the leptons from the \u03c7 \u00b1 1 decay. Results for models with a gluino decaying to an onshell top squark are shown in Fig. 5 as a function of the gluino and LSP masses. For the T5tttt model ( Fig. 5-top), for which we take m t 1 = m \u03c7 0 1 + m t , similar exclusion curves are obtained as for the T1tttt model in Fig. 4-left because the production cross section and the final-state particles are the same. The limit becomes weaker when there is a small mass difference between the top squark and the LSP: for m t 1 \u2212 m \u03c7 0 1 = 20 GeV, the limit on the gluino mass is 1140 GeV for small LSP masses and about 850 GeV for m \u03c7 0 1 = 700 GeV (Fig. 5-bottom left). In the case of the T5ttcc model with the same SUSY particle mass values, the sensitivity is slightly reduced because of the smaller number of leptons and b jets in the final state (Fig. 5-bottom right). Figure 6 shows the results for b squark production in the T6ttWW model in the chargino ( \u03c7 \u00b1 1 ) versus b squark mass      Results for the T5qqqqWW model are shown in Fig. 7 as a function of the gluino and LSP masses, with two different assumptions for the chargino mass: it is either assumed to be the average of m g and m \u03c7 0 1 , or it is set to m \u03c7 0 1 + 20 GeV. In the first case ( Fig. 7-left), the exclusion limit on gluino masses exceeds 1100 GeV for LSP masses up to 400 GeV; for larger LSP masses the limit is reduced to 830 GeV at m \u03c7 0 1 = 700 GeV. In the second case ( Fig. 7-right), due to the smaller mass difference, leptons in the final state are soft and thus the sensitivity is reduced.",

The observed = 50 GeV. For a description of the notation, see Fig. 4 (expected) upper limit on \u03c3 (pp \u2192 tt)+\u03c3 (pp \u2192 tt) is 1.7 pb (1.5 +0.7 \u22120.4 pb). Finally, we report model independent limits on the product of cross section, detector acceptance, and selection efficiency, \u03c3A , for the production of an SS dilepton pair in the two inclusive HH regions, SR31 and SR32, using the CL s criterion without the asymptotic approximation. In SR31 the limit is computed as a function of the minimum threshold on E miss T for H T > 300 GeV, while in SR32 it is computed as a function of the H T threshold for 50 < E miss T < 300 GeV. The results are shown in Fig. 8, where, in regions with no observed events, the minimum limit value of 1.3 fb is obtained. These limits can be used to test additional BSM models, after accounting for the event selection efficiency. The lepton efficiency ranges between 70-85 % (45-70 %) for generated muons (electrons) with |\u03b7| < 2.4 and p T > 25 GeV, increasing as a function of p T and converging to the maximum value for p T > 60 GeV; the efficiencies of the H T and E miss T requirements are mostly determined by the jet energy and E miss T resolutions, which are discussed in Refs.

            "text": "No significant deviation from the standard model expectations is observed. The results are used to set limits on the production of supersymmetric particles in various simplified models. Gluino and bottom squark masses are excluded at the 95 % confidence level up to 1300 and 680 GeV, respectively. These results extend the limits obtained in the previous version of the analysis [23] by about 250 GeV on the gluino mass, and 150 GeV on the bottom squark mass. In addition, 95 % confidence level upper limits of 119 fb and 1.7 pb are set on the cross sections for the production of two top quark-antiquark pairs and for the production of two SS top quarks, respectively. Model independent limits and selection efficiencies are provided to allow further interpretations of the results, using alternative models to those examined here.
