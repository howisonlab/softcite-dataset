            "text": "The studies of exclusive meson electroproduction off protons with the CLAS detector at Jefferson Lab extended considerably the knowledge on the structure of the ground and excited nucleon states [1,2]. Currently they are the only source of the information on many facets of the strong QCD dynamics in generation of the excited nucleon states of different quantum numbers with distinctively different structural features. The CLAS detector has produced the dominant part of the available world data on all meson electroproduction channels off the nucleon relevant in the resonance region for Q 2 up to 5.0 GeV 2 . The numerical values of all observables measured with the CLAS detector are stored in the CLAS Physics Database [3]. Analyses of these experimental data within the framework of the reaction models developed by the CLAS collaboration [4][5][6][7][8][9] provided the first and only available in the world information on electroexcitation amplitudes A 1/2 (Q 2 ), A 3/2 (Q 2 ), and S 1/2 (Q 2 ) (\u03b3 v pN * -electrocouplings) of most excited nucleon states in the mass range up to 1.8 GeV and at photon virtualities Q 2 up to 5.0 GeV 2 [10].The numerical values of the \u03b3 v pN * -electrocouplings from CLAS and the computer codes for their interpolation/extrapolation at Q 2 < 5.0 GeV 2 can be found in the web pages [11,12]. The CLAS results on the photocouplings of most excited nucleon states in the mass range up to 2.0 GeV have recently become available from the exclusive \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 p photoproduction off protons data [13]. In the near term future, electrocouplings of most excited nucleon states in the mass range up to 2.0 GeV will become available at Q 2 up to 5.0 GeV 2 from analyses of the CLAS exclusive meson electroproduction data [14][15][16].",

Analyses of the CLAS results on \u03b3 v pN * -electrocouplings within continuum QCD Dyson-Schwinger Equation (DSE) approach conclusively demonstrated the capability of getting insight into strong QCD dynamics underlying the generation of the dominant part of hadron mass from combined studies of the experimental results on the nucleon elastic form factors and electrocouplings of different excited nucleons with distinctively different structural features [9,17,18]. Insight to the mechanisms underlying the hadron mass generation was confirmed in the studies of the CLAS results on the nucleon elastic form factors and \u03b3 v pN * -electrocouplings within independent framework of the novel relativistic quark model which incorporates the momentum dependence of constituent quark mass and the modeling of meson-baryon cloud [19][20][21].",

            "text": "Detailed information on the electrocouplings of most excited nucleon states from the CLAS offers the new opportunities in exploration of the ground nucleon structure from the inclusive electron scattering data. The data on inclusive electron scattering off protons described in terms of well-known structure functions F 1 (x B , Q 2 ) and F 2 (x B , Q 2 ) offer an access to the parton distribution functions (PDF) in the ground nucleons f i (x B , Q 2 ) (index i stands for all flavor current quarks/anti-quarks and gauge gluons) [22]. The PDFs determine the probability to find ith-parton with fraction x of the total nucleon momentum. They are defined on the light front and evolve with the distance scale determined by the photon virtuality Q 2 . The behavior of the parton distributions at large values of x B corresponded to the nucleon resonance excitation region is the subject of a special interest. At large x B the perturbative-QCD (pQCD) prediction on behavior of parton distributions become possible [22]. Furthermore, the development of novel pseudo-and quasi-PDF concepts [23][24][25] makes it possible to relate the non-perturbative behavior of the PDFs to the QCD Lagrangian by employing lQCD evaluations for the pseudo-and quasi-PDF and taking the appropriate limit for the transformation of these approximations for PDF into the accessible from the experimental data PDFs.",

The peaks from the first, second and third resonance regions are clearly seen demonstrating promising opportunity to extract \u03b3 v pN * -electrocouplings from exclusive meson electroproduction data with CLAS and the future data with the CLAS12 detector in the range of photon virtualities Q 2 < 7.0 GeV 2 . Three resonant peaks demonstrate very different evolution with Q 2 . The first peak consisted of the \u2206(1232)3/2 + and the tail of N (1440)1/2 + resonance contributions decreases with Q 2 most rapidly in comparison with two others peaks. Instead, the second resonance peak, composed by the contributions from N (1440)1/2 + , N (1520)3/2 \u2212 , and N (1535)1/2 \u2212 resonances, demonstrates the most slow evolution with Q 2 . Rate of the fall-off with Q 2 for the third resonance peak   The CLAS12 is the only facility in the world capable to obtain the results on \u03b3 v pN *resonance electrocouplings at the highest photon virtualities ever achieved in exclusive reactions of 5.0 GeV 2 < Q 2 < 12.0 GeV 2 . The first results foreseen in these efforts will be the measurements of the inclusive structure function in the resonance region at high photon virtualities of Q 2 > 5.0 GeV 2 . We made prediction for the total virtual-photonproton cross sections measured with the CLAS12 in the range of photon virtualities 4.0 GeV 2 < Q 2 < 7.0 GeV 2 . The predicted cross section and their expected statistical uncertainties are shown in Fig 4. The statistical uncertainties are evaluated for the integrated luminosity 12.8 * 10 10 mcbn \u22121 collected in the Spring 2018 run with the CLAS12 and for the bin sizes over W and Q 2 \u2206W =0.01 GeV and \u2206Q 2 =0.1 GeV 2 .",

The computations of these observables can be done in the real time at the kinematical grid defined by user in the interactive web page [28]. The developed tool is of interest for analyses of the data from CLAS and the future data from the CLAS12. Estimated values of inclusive electron scattering observables allow us to check normalization of all semiinclusive and exclusive processes under studies with the CLAS/CLAS12 and validate the credible evaluation of the electron detection efficiency used in the analyses of the experimental data. Projected inclusive electron scattering observables at Q 2 > 5.0 GeV 2 are useful in the planning of the future experiments with the CLAS12 on exploration of hadron structure in the experiments with the electromagnetic probes.",
