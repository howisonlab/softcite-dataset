The data collected with the CMS detector at the LHC correspond to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 . The observed distributions, corrected to particle level, are found to be in agreement with predictions from perturbative quantum chromodynamics that include electroweak corrections. Constraints are placed on models containing quark contact interactions, extra spatial dimensions, quantum black holes, or dark matter, using the detector-level distributions. In a benchmark model where only left-handed quarks participate, contact interactions are excluded at the 95% confidence level up to a scale of 12.8 or 17.5 TeV, for destructive or constructive interference, respectively. The most stringent lower limits to date are set on the ultraviolet cutoff in the Arkani-Hamed-Dimopoulos-Dvali model of extra dimensions. In the Giudice-Rattazzi-Wells convention, the cutoff scale is excluded up to 10.1 TeV. The production of quantum black holes is excluded for masses below 5.9 and 8.2 TeV, depending on the model. For the first time, lower limits between 2.0 and 4.6 TeV are set on the mass of a dark matter mediator for (axial-)vector mediators, for the universal quark coupling g q = 1.0.",

            "text": "Pairs of highly energetic jets (dijets) are produced at high rates in proton-proton collisions at the CERN LHC through pointlike scattering of quarks and gluons. Despite its enormous success, the shortcomings of the standard model (SM) are well known. Many theories of physics beyond the standard model (BSM) that alter the interaction of quarks and gluons from that predicted by perturbative quantum chromodynamics (QCD) give rise to narrow or wide resonances e-mail: cms-publication-committee-chair@cern.ch or even to nonresonant dijet signatures. Examples that have received widespread attention include models with dark matter (DM) [1][2][3][4][5], quark compositeness [6][7][8], extra spatial dimensions [9,10], and quantum black holes [11][12][13][14][15]. Resonances with an intrinsic width of the order of the experimental resolution can be constrained by searches in the dijet invariant mass spectrum [16][17][18]. These searches, however, are not very sensitive to wide resonances or nonresonant signatures; a more effective strategy to constrain such signatures is the study of dijet angular distributions [19].",

            "text": "The angular distribution of dijets relative to the beam direction is sensitive to the dynamics of the scattering process. Furthermore, since the angular distributions of the dominant underlying QCD processes of qg \u2192 qg, qq \u2192 qq , qq \u2192 qq, gg \u2192 gg, are all similar [20], the dijet angular distribution is insensitive to uncertainties in the parton distribution functions (PDFs). The dijet angular distribution is typically expressed in terms of \u03c7 dijet = exp(|y 1 \u2212 y 2 |), where y 1 and y 2 are the rapidities of the two jets with the highest transverse momentum p T (the leading jets). For collinear massless parton scattering, \u03c7 dijet takes the form \u03c7 dijet = (1 + |cos \u03b8 * |)/(1 \u2212 |cos \u03b8 * |), where \u03b8 * is the polar scattering angle in the parton-parton center-of-mass (CM) frame. The choice of \u03c7 dijet , rather than \u03b8 * , to measure the dijet angular distribution is motivated by the fact that in Rutherford scattering, where only t-channel scattering contributes to the partonic cross section, the \u03c7 dijet distribution is independent of |y 1 \u2212 y 2 | [20]. In contrast, BSM processes may have scattering angle distributions that are closer to being isotropic than those given by QCD processes and can be identified by an excess of events at small values of \u03c7 dijet . Previous measurements of dijet angular distributions at the LHC have been reported by the ATLAS [17,[21][22][23][24][25] and CMS [26][27][28][29] Collaborations.",

In this model, the relative width of the DM mediator increases monotonically with increasing g q . In a scenario where g q = 0.25 and in which the relative widths for vector and axial-vector mediators in the dark matter decay channels are negligible, values of M Med below 3.0 TeV were excluded by narrow dijet resonance searches [17,18]. A search for narrow and broad dijet resonances set constraints on mediator widths up to 30% (g q < 0.75) and masses up to 4 TeV [32]. Searches for invisible particles produced in association with quarks or bosons [33][34][35] have excluded vector and axial-vector mediators below 1.8 (2.1) TeV for g q = 0.25 (g q = 1.0) and g DM = 1.0 [34].",

The signature of the signals can be categorized into nonresonant excesses at high M jj as predicted by the CI and ADD models and resonances from the decay of QBHs and DM mediators that could appear across the whole range of the M jj spectrum. The searches are performed by comparing detector-level dijet angular distributions with BSM predictions that have been adjusted to include detector resolution effects. This eliminates some systematic uncertainties that are introduced when correcting the dijet angular distributions for detector effects and simplifies the statistical evaluation. The dijet angular distributions are also corrected to particle level to facilitate comparisons with other theoretical predictions and published in HEPData.",

The trackers cover a pseudorapidity region of |\u03b7| < 2.5 while the calorimeters cover |\u03b7| < 3.0. In addition, CMS has extensive forward calorimetry, which extends the coverage to |\u03b7| < 5.0. Finally, muons are measured in gasionization detectors embedded in the steel flux-return yoke of the solenoid, with a coverage of |\u03b7| < 2.4. A two-tiered system, with a level-1 trigger followed by a high-level trigger (HLT), is used by CMS to record events of interest [41] for the offline analysis. A more detailed description of the CMS detector, together with a definition of the coordinate system used and the relevant kinematic variables, can be found in Ref. [42].",

In order to mitigate the effect of additional proton-proton interactions within the same or nearby bunch crossings (pileup) on the jet momentum measurement, the charged hadron subtraction technique [43] is used. Spurious jets from noise or non-collision backgrounds are rejected by applying jet identification criteria [46]. The jet energies are corrected for nonlinear and nonuniform response of the calorimeters through corrections obtained from data and Monte Carlo (MC) simulations [47]. To compare data with theoretical predictions, the same jet clustering algorithm is applied to the generated stable particles (lifetime c\u03c4 > 1 cm) from MC simulations with leading order (LO) pythia 8.212 [48,49] predictions, and to the outgoing partons from next-to-leading (NLO) predictions.",

The corrections for these effects are obtained from a two-dimensional response matrix that maps the generator-level M jj and \u03c7 dijet distributions onto the measured values. This matrix is obtained using particle-level jets from the pythia MC event generator that are smeared in p T using a double-sided Crystal Ball parameterization [51] of the response. This parameterization takes into account the full jet energy resolution, including non-Gaussian tails, and is derived from the full detector simulation. The width of the Gaussian core in the parameterization is adjusted to account for the difference in resolution observed between data and simulation [47]. The reason for deriving the response matrix from smeared generator-level MC rather than from full detector simulation is that significantly smaller statistical uncertainties can be achieved using the faster code. The measured distributions are unfolded to particle level by inverting the response matrix without regularization, using the RooUnfold package [52]. The unfolding changes the shape of the \u03c7 dijet distributions by < 1% and < 8% across \u03c7 dijet in the lowest and highest M jj ranges, respectively. The fractions of event migrations between mass bins are 15-20% in the lowest M jj range and 25-40% in the highest M jj range, depending on \u03c7 dijet values. The unfolding procedure was tested by splitting the simulation data into independent training and testing samples. The training sample was used to derive a response matrix and the smeared \u03c7 dijet distributions from the test sample were unfolded using this response matrix. No significant difference was observed between the generated and unfolded \u03c7 dijet distributions in the test sample. The effects of migrations between \u03c7 dijet bins are negligible. The unfolding procedure is based on matrix inversion, while the procedure used in previous publications of dijet angular distributions [28,29] was based on the D'Agostini iterative method [53]. We have compared these two methods by deriving limits from unfolded data, and the limits vary by less than 5%.",

In protonproton collisions, the \u039b \u00b1 LL and \u039b \u00b1 RR models result in identical lowest order cross sections and NLO corrections, and consequently lead to the same sensitivity. For \u039b \u00b1 VV and \u039b \u00b1 AA , as well as for \u039b \u00b1 (V\u2212A) , the CI predictions are also identical at lowest order, but exhibit different NLO corrections and yield different sensitivities. The cijet 1.0 program [68] is used to calculate the CI terms, as well as the interference between the CI and QCD terms at NLO in QCD. For the ADD model, two parameterizations for virtual graviton exchange are considered: Giudice-Rattazzi-Wells (GRW) [69] and Han-Lykken-Zhang (HLZ) [70]. In the GRW convention, the sum over the Kaluza-Klein graviton excitations in the effective field theory is regulated by a single cutoff parameter \u039b T . In the HLZ convention, the effective theory is described in terms of two parameters, the cutoff scale M S and the number of extra spatial dimensions n ED . The parameters M S and n ED are directly related to \u039b T [71]. We consider models with 2-6 EDs. The case of n ED = 1 is not considered since it would require an ED of the size of the radius of the solar system; the gravitational potential at such distances would be noticeably modified, and this case is therefore excluded by observation. The case of n ED = 2 is special in the sense that the relation between M S and \u039b T also depends on the parton-parton CM energy \u221a s. The ADD predictions are calculated using pythia.",

We use mass bins with M jj > 3.6 TeV for the CI models, M jj > 4.2 TeV for the ADD models, and M jj > 4.8 TeV for the QBH models. For the DM mediators, we use mass bins that cover the M jj range of 0.5M Med -1.2M Med . The exclusion limits on the BSM models are determined using detector-level \u03c7 dijet distributions and theoretical predictions at detector level. By using the detector-level \u03c7 dijet distributions, each bin of the \u03c7 dijet distributions can be modeled by a Poisson likelihood function, while at particle level, the unfolded data distributions have correlations among the dijet mass bins. As a cross-check, the limits are also determined for the case where the unfolded \u03c7 dijet distributions, approximated by Poisson likelihood functions, and particle-level theoretical predictions are used in the limit extraction procedure. The resulting observed limits on the BSM scales and masses are found to be more stringent than those determined at detector level by 1-10%, depending on the model. The agreement of the data with QCD predictions is quantified by calculating P QCD (q < q obs ) for each mass bin separately. The largest excess is found in the first data point of the > 6.0 TeV mass bin, with a significance of 1.8 standard deviations. When combining mass bins in the various QCD+BSM models under study, the largest significances are found to be 2.7-2.8 standard deviations for the QCD+DM model with M Med = 4.5-6 TeV and g q = 1.0. 35.9 fb Fig. 3 The 95% CL upper limits on the quark coupling g q , as a function of mass, for an axial-vector or vector DM mediator with g DM = 1.0 and m DM = 1 GeV.

These are compared to constraints from the cosmological relic density of DM (gray) determined from astrophysical measurements [87], using MadDM. In the hatched area, DM is overabundant. The observed and expected lower bounds for M Med overlap with each other obtained in 2016 from proton-proton collisions at the LHC. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 . The angular distributions, measured over a wide range of dijet invariant masses, are found to be in agreement with the predictions of perturbative quantum chromodynamics. The results are used to set 95% confidence level lower limits on the contact interaction scale for a variety of quark compositeness models, the ultraviolet cutoff in models of extra spatial dimensions, the minimum mass of quantum black holes, and the mass and couplings in dark matter models. For the first time, lower limits between 2.0 and 4.6 TeV are set on the mass of a dark matter mediator for (axial-)vector mediators, for the universal quark coupling 1.0 \u2264 g q \u2264 1.4. This region is not accessible through dijet resonance searches. The lower limits for the contact interaction scale \u039b range from 9.2 to 22.4 TeV.
