The parity (P ) symmetry represents the system is unchanged under the space reflection. The violation of parity, firstly proposed by Lee and Yang and subsequently discovered in 1956, plays the key role in the understanding of the weak interaction which is one of the four basic forces of nature. The charge (C) symmetry describes a property between particles and their anti-particles. The violation of the combined charge-parity (CP ) symmetry was unexpectedly observed in kaon meson decays in 1964. The C and CP violation (CP V ) are required to explore why there are much more matter than anti-matter in the Universe.",

All the six quarks were found in the following twenty years. This theory was finally manifested by the observation of CP V in the bottom-quark meson system in 2001. The measured amount of CP V in the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics is about ten orders of magnitude smaller than required by the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the Universe. Therefore, it is important to search for new sources of CP V beyond the SM (BSM). The KM mechanism also predicts the existence of CP V in the",

Including all the stronginteraction effects, especially the non-perturbative contributions, the topological diagrammatic approach works well for hadronic charm-meson decays by extracting the tree amplitudes from the data of branching fractions [7][8][9]. CC pointed out that the upper bound of \u2206A CP in the SM is \u22120.25% [9] which is more than 2\u03c3 away from the experimental result at that time. Later on, they assumed that the penguin-exchange diagram is identical to the W -exchange diagram, P E = E, so that \u2206A CP = (\u22121.39 \u00b1 0.04) \u00d7 10 \u22123 or (\u22121.51 \u00b1 0.04) \u00d7 10 \u22123 [7], and updated with similar results in [10]. To give a reasonable uncertainty of the CC approach, considering the possible difference between P E and E, we take P E ranging from E/2 to 2E. Under the factorization hypothesis, LLY proposed the factorizationassisted topological-amplitude approach which relates the penguin amplitudes to the tree amplitudes without any additional free parameters. Considering the uncertainties of input parameters, it is predicted that \u2206A CP = (\u22120.57 \u223c \u22121.87) \u00d7 10 \u22123 [8], which is consistent with the latest result by the LHCb measurement.",

Due to their generally rich decays structure multibody decays offer additional interesting possibility how to look for CP V signatures. However, at the same time such a studies generally require more complicated analysis methods and higher recorded luminosity. Another interesting measurement is being performed to investigate a novel effect of CP V in charmed meson decaying into K 0 S , which comes from mother decay and daughter mixing with predicted values reaching the available experimental sensitivity [16].",

Another dedicated heavy-flavour experiment is Belle II, which started taking data in 2019, from which contributions to CP V measurements are expected, especially results from the decays with neutral particles in the final states. Another substantial upgrade of the LHCb is planned for the time period after 2030, with additional ten fold increase of luminosity. The LHCb is currently expected to be the only dedicated heavy-flavour experiment taking data during that time period. Table 1 summarises current and expected future trigger-level yields and sensitivity in promptly produced D 0 \u2192 K + K \u2212 and D 0 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decays. In summary, the first experimental observation of CP violation in the charm sector was done with an amazing sensitivity obtained by LHCb in 2019. This is a milestone in the high energy physics. The result is consistent with the theoretical predictions by CC and LLY. It is expected that more precise measurements and more theoretical studies in the near future will help us to deeply understand the dynamics at the charm scale and to explore the new physics effects.",
