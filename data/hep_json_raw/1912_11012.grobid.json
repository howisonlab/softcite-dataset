The observed topology is compatible with tau neutrino charged current (CC) interactions with charm production and neutrino neutral current (NC) interactions with cc pair production. However, other processes can mimic this topology. A dedicated analysis was implemented to identify the underlying process. A Monte Carlo simulation was developed and complementary procedures were introduced in the kinematic reconstruction. A multivariate analysis technique was used to achieve an optimal separation of signal from background. Most likely, this event is a \u03bd \u03c4 CC interaction with charm production, the tau and charm particle decaying into 1 prong and 2 prongs, respectively. The significance of this observation is evaluated.",

Background arises from pions and kaons decaying in flight or hadron interactions without any visible nuclear break-up.",

An image based procedure is applied to identify and reconstruct the electromagnetic showers [22]. An additional image data taking with 1 micron Z pitch is performed in a cone of 400 mrad aperture around the slope of the primary photon (e + e \u2212 mean slope), starting from film 31 down to film 57 in the brick. All tracks in the volume are reconstructed using the 3D clustering algorithm. The main features of the reconstructed showers are listed in Table 3 and shown in Fig. 6. The most downstream shower tracks are reconstructed in the CS films. Given the accuracy of the reconstruction, \u03b3 1 is most probably attached to V I I I , while \u03b3 2 may emerge from any vertex (V I , V I I or V I I I ), see IPs in Table 3. In the next step of the analysis the photons origin vertex is not taken into account since the classifier procedure relies only on the total visible electromagnetic energy. In order to reduce hadron interaction background, a dedicated scanning system with   Table 4. Track 2 is observed only in three emulsion films and it is identified as a Minimum Ionizing Particle (MIP) by counting the grains along the track. The momentum estimation by range [24] discards the proton hypothesis. The particle is most likely a pion with an energy of 0.2 GeV. An additional estimation is performed considering absorption processes. Pion absorption cross-section has a resonance at a kinetic energy of about 0.2 GeV in any material [25,26]. In this region, especially for heavy nuclei, this cross section is up to \u223c 40% of the total cross section. Under these assumptions, the momentum estimation for track 2 is (0.31\u00b10.08) GeV/c. This is the initial momentum of a pion which is absorbed after crossing 3 mm of lead and that has a kinetic energy of about 0.2 GeV when absorbed. The uncertainty is evaluated assuming a uniform kinetic energy distribution: the minimum is the kinetic energy such that \u03b2 > 0.7; while the maximum is 0.3 GeV, which is the endpoint of the absorption peak. \u03b2 = 0.7 is the minimum for a MIP according to the emulsion grain density [27].",

The effect of uncertainties on the expected number of events are introduced as scale factors f i for each background process and f s for the signal. They depend on 5 nuisance parameters \u03c3 \u03bd : (i) a 20% normalisation factor, dominated by the CNGS flux uncertainty [10]; (ii) a 20% uncertainty on the cross section of \u03bdNC interactions with charm pair production; (iii) a 20% uncertainty on the cross section of \u03bd \u03c4 CC interactions with single charm; (iv) a 6% uncertainty on \u03bd \u03c4 CC interactions cross section (without charm), for \u03bd \u03c4 ener-gies in the range of few tens of GeV [40]; (v) a 30% uncer-tainty on the hadronic re-interaction rate, based on test beamresults [27]. These nuisance parameters \u03c3 k are constrained by some uniform or Gaussian probability densities g k .",
