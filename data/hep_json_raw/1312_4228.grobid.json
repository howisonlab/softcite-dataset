Figure 1 shows the lowest order SM decay diagram for B 0 \u2192 p\u039b\u03c0 \u2212 \u03b3. It proceeds via the radiative penguin process. The p\u039b system in this decay will have a smaller maximum kinetic energy than in B \u00fe \u2192 p\u039b\u03b3 due to the extra pion in the X s fragmentation process. This matches the threshold enhancement effect naturally and implies a higher decay rate [16]. The measured branching fraction of B 0 \u2192 p\u039b\u03c0 \u2212 \u03b3 can be useful to tune the parameters in JETSET, and, in the case of a large enhancement of the branching fraction, the uncertainty on the measurement of B\u00f0B \u2192 X s \u03b3\u00de would be reduced using a sum of exclusive final states.",

The Belle detector is a large-solid-angle magnetic spectrometer that consists of a silicon vertex detector (SVD), a 50-layer central drift chamber (CDC), an array of aerogel threshold Cherenkov counters (ACC), a barrel-like arrangement of time-of-flight scintillation counters (TOF) and an electromagnetic calorimeter comprised of CsI(Tl) crystals located inside a superconducting solenoid that provides a 1.5 T magnetic field. An iron flux return located outside the solenoid is instrumented to detect K 0 L mesons and to identify muons. The detector is described in detail elsewhere [17]. The data set used in this analysis was collected with two different inner detector configurations. About 152 \u00d7 10 6 BB pairs were collected with a beam pipe of radius 2 cm and with three layers of SVD, while the rest of the data set was collected with a beam pipe of radius 1.5 cm and four layers of SVD [19].",

There are five PDFs in the fit: signal, self-crossfeed, continuum background, and the two measured rare decay modes (B \u00fe \u2192 p\u039b\u03c0 0 and B \u00fe \u2192 p\u039b\u03b3). The other five rare-B modes are considered only in the systematic uncertainties, as discussed later. We use two-dimensional smoothed histograms to represent the M bc \u2212 \u0394E PDFs of the signal, selfcrossfeed, and two measured rare-B modes. The signal PDF is calibrated by comparing the difference between data and MC simulation for the B \u00fe \u2192 K \u00c3\u00fe \u03b3 control sample. The PDF that describes the continuum background is a product of an ARGUS function [23] in M bc and a second-order polynomial in \u0394E. The ratio of self-crossfeed events to signal events is fixed, which is estimated from the MC simulation, and the yields of two measured rare modes are also fixed according to the measured branching fractions [5,7]. The free parameters in the fit are the signal yield, the continuum yield, and the continuum shape parameters.",

The uncertainty due to photon selection is evaluated with a radiative Bhabha sample to be 2.2%. The uncertainties due to the R selection and the signal PDF shape are estimated using the control sample of B \u00fe \u2192 K \u00c3\u00fe \u03b3. Because of the presence of the selfcrossfeed PDF in the fit, the uncertainty due to the signal PDF shape is inflated by a factor of ffiffi ffi 2 p . The uncertainty due to the signal decay model is estimated to be 5.1% by using different decay models. For instance, the base decay model of our study is B 0 \u2192 X s \u03b3 with X s \u2192 p\u039b\u03c0 \u2212 decaying uniformly in phase space; the mass of X s has a simple Breit-Wigner distribution with a mean value at 2.5 GeV=c 2 and a 0.3 GeV=c 2 width. An alternate model is X s \u2192 X pl \u03c0 \u2212 with X pl \u2192 p\u039b, where X pl stands for the threshold peak measured in Ref. [7]. The uncertainties for the two measured rare modes discussed above are estimated by varying each yield in the fit by AE1\u03c3, where \u03c3 denotes the measurement error on the branching fraction. The uncertainty for the five unmeasured rare modes discussed above is estimated by incorporating their PDFs in the fit and floating their yields. As the signal yield is reduced by this fit, we did not include this effect in the upper limit calculation described below to get a conservative upper limit. The overall systematic uncertainty due to rare B decays is 8.2% and dominates in this measurement.",
