No deviations from the predictions of the standard model are observed. The results are interpreted in the context of dark matter production and models containing extra spatial dimensions, and limits on new physics parameters are calculated at 95% confidence level. For the two simplified dark matter production models considered, the observed (expected) lower limits on the mediator masses are both 950 (1150) GeV for 1 GeV dark matter mass. For an effective electroweak-dark matter contact interaction, the observed (expected) lower limit on the suppression parameter \u039b is 850 (950) GeV. Values of the effective Planck scale up to 2.85-2.90 TeV are excluded for between 3 and 6 extra spatial dimensions.",

No significant excess over the SM prediction was observed. For the DM simplified model, a lower limit of 1200 GeV for both the vector and axial-vector mediator mass was set for low DM masses under the same assumption on the new-physics coupling values. For the EWK-DM effective interaction, a lower limit for the suppression parameter of the coupling was set at 790 GeV.

The jet momentum is determined as the vector sum of all particle momenta in the jet. Because of the large number of additional pp interactions within the same or nearby bunch crossings (pileup), particles emerging from multiple interactions can be clustered into a jet. To mitigate this effect, charged candidates associated with vertices other than the primary one are discarded from clustering, and an offset correction is applied to the p T of the jet to subtract the remaining contributions [19]. Jet energy corrections are derived from simulation to bring, on average, the measured response of jets to that of particle level jets. Measurements on data of the momentum balance in dijet, photon+jet, Z+jet, and multijet events are used to account for any residual differences in jet energy scale in data and simulation. Additional selection criteria are applied to each jet to remove jets potentially dominated by anomalous contributions from various subdetector components or reconstruction failures [19].",

In particular, anomalous ECAL energy deposits resulting from the interaction of particles in the ECAL photodetectors, from here on referred to as \"ECAL spikes\", as well as beam halo muons that accompany proton beams and penetrate the detector longitudinally have been found to produce spurious photon candidates at nonnegligible rates. The ECAL spike background is reduced by requiring that the photon candidate cluster must comprise more than a single ECAL crystal. To reject the beam halo induced EM showers, the ECAL signal in the seed crystal of the photon cluster is required to be within \u00b13 ns of the arrival time expected for particles originating from a collision. In addition, the maximum of the total calorimeter energy summed along all possible paths of beam halo particles passing through the cluster (halo total energy), calculated for each photon candidate, must be below 4.9 GeV. The two requirements combined with the shower shape constraint suppress the beam halo background effectively, while retaining 95% of signal photons. Furthermore, using features described in section 5.4, the signal region is split into two parts according to \u03c6 to constrain the beam halo normalization.

Samples are prepared in a grid of values for the number of extra dimensions and M D . The efficiency of the full event selection for these signal models ranges between 0.06 and 0.29 for the DM simplified models, 0.44 and 0.46 for EW DM production, and 0.23 and 0.30 for the ADD model, depending on the parameters of the models. The most significant SM background processes in this search are the associated production of a high-energy \u03b3 with either a Z boson that subsequently decays to a pair of neutrinos, or a W boson that decays to a charged lepton and a neutrino. The two processes are denoted as Z(\u2192 \u03bd\u03bd)+\u03b3 and W(\u2192 \u03bd)+\u03b3. Together, they account for approximately 70% of the SM background, with 50% from the former and 20% from the latter. Contributions from these two background processes are estimated using observed data in the four mutually exclusive single-electron, single-muon, dielectron, and dimuon control regions defined in section 3. The ratios between the expected yields of these processes are constrained by MC simulations of V+\u03b3 processes.",

            "text": "Four sources of systematic uncertainties considered for E \u03b3 T distribution ratios among the V+\u03b3 processes are PDFs, higher-order QCD corrections, higher-order EWK corrections, and data-to-simulation correction factors \u03c1. The PDF uncertainty is evaluated by varying the weight of each event using the weights provided in the NNPDF set, and taking the standard deviation of the resulting E \u03b3 T distributions. This uncertainty is considered fully correlated in the ratio between the Z(\u2192 \u03bd\u03bd)+\u03b3 and W(\u2192 \u03bd)+\u03b3 processes, i.e., the variation of the ratio is bounded by the ratios of the upward and downward variations. Uncertainties related to higher-order QCD corrections are considered uncorrelated in the ratio between the Z(\u2192 \u03bd\u03bd)+\u03b3 and W(\u2192 \u03bd)+\u03b3 processes. Because EW corrections become increasingly important at higher E \u03b3 T , but are known only up to NLO accuracy, their uncertainties are estimated by a special prescription similar to that discussed in ref. [34], where independent degrees of freedom are assigned to the uncertainty in the overall scale of the correction and the uncertainty in the variation of the correlation with E \u03b3 T . Additionally, the full correction due to photon-induced Z + \u03b3 and W + \u03b3 production cross sections is considered as an uncertainty. Further details concerning the higher-order QCD and EWK corrections are given in appendix A. Finally, data-to-simulation correction factors \u03c1 for the lepton identification efficiencies have associated uncertainties that do not cancel when taking ratios between regions defined by different lepton selection requirements. The four uncertainties are all considered as correlated between the E \u03b3 T bins. The background estimation method exploits cancellation of some of the systematic uncertainties, both experimental and theoretical, in the ratios of the photon E \u03b3 T distributions of V+\u03b3 processes, from here on referred to as \"transfer factors\". For example, in the transfer factor between the Z(\u2192 \u03bd\u03bd)+\u03b3 and Z(\u2192 )+\u03b3 processes, denoted  . The uncertainty bands in green (inner) and orange (outer) show the systematic uncertainty, and the combination of systematic and statistical uncertainty arising from limited MC sample size, respectively. The systematic uncertainties considered are the uncertainties in the data-to-simulation correction factors \u03c1 for the lepton identification efficiencies. Simulated Z(\u2192 )+\u03b3 events are generated in two samples, one with generated E \u03b3 T required to be greater than 300 GeV, and one with a looser restriction. The E \u03b3 T bin centred at 270 GeV is close to the boundary between the two samples, where there are fewer generated events. The relatively large statistical fluctuation visible in the third bin of the right-hand figure results from this. the uncertainties due to photon energy calibration, jet energy resolution, and higher-order QCD effects are significantly reduced compared to when such effects are considered for individual processes. The only uncertainties in the transfer factor R Z\u03b3 \u03b3 that do not largely cancel are those on lepton identification efficiency and the statistical uncertainty due to the limited MC sample size. Figure 2 shows the transfer factor R Z\u03b3 ee\u03b3 (R Z\u03b3 \u00b5\u00b5\u03b3 ) between the dielectron (dimuon) control region and the combined signal regions, for which the numerator is the expected Z(\u2192 \u03bd\u03bd)+\u03b3 yield in the combined signal regions and the denominator is the expected Z(\u2192 )+\u03b3 yield in the relevant control region.",

The observed distributions are in agreement with the prediction from SM and noncollision backgrounds. In particular, the fit estimates the beam halo background to be zero in both regions. The dominant systematic uncertainties in the signal model include those on the integrated luminosity, jet and \u03b3 energy scales, p miss T resolution, and data-to-simulation scale factors discussed in section 5. The expected yields in each bin of E \u03b3 T for all backgrounds in the horizontal and vertical signal regions after performing a combined fit to data in all the control samples, excluding data in the signal regions, are given in tables 1 and 2, respectively. The covariances between the predicted background yields across all the E \u03b3 T bins in the two signal regions are shown in figure 15 in appendix A.
