R pPb is consistent with unity within uncertainties at mid-rapidity and forward rapidity. In the backward region a slight enhancement of the yield of heavy-flavour decay muons is found in the region 2 < p T < 4 GeV/c. The results are described within uncertainties by theoretical calculations that include initial-state effects. The measurements add experimental evidence that the suppression of heavy-flavour production observed at high p T in central Pb-Pb collisions with respect to pp collisions is due to a medium effect induced by the interaction of heavy quarks with the partonic matter.",

            "text": "Heavy quarks (charm and beauty) are essential probes of the properties of the medium created in heavy-ion collisions, since they are produced in the early stage of hadronic collisions via scattering processes with large momentum transfer. Heavy-flavour production has been measured via semi-electronic and semi-muonic decays, as well as fully reconstructed D mesons, in pp, p-Pb and Pb-Pb collisions with ALICE [1] at the LHC. In central Pb-Pb collisions at \u221a s NN = 2.76 TeV, a strong suppression of high transverse momentum (p T ) D mesons and electrons (muons) from heavy-flavour hadron decays was observed at mid-(forward) rapidity [2,3,4]. This suppression is interpreted as an effect of parton energy loss in the medium created in heavy-ion collisions. However, a quantitative understanding of the Pb-Pb results requires cold nuclear matter (CNM) effects to be taken into account, which can be accessed by studying p-Pb collisions [5,6] assuming that a hot and dense extended system is not formed in such collisions. CNM effects are studied using the nuclear modification factor R pPb , defined as",

At mid-rapidity, the Inner Tracking System (ITS) and the Time Projection Chamber (TPC) provide track reconstruction down to very low transverse momentum (\u223c100 MeV/c) with a momentum resolution better than 4% for p T < 20 GeV/c, as well as good impact parameter (distance of closest approach of the track to the primary interaction vertex) resolution [1,8]. D mesons are reconstructed via their hadronic decay channels and electrons from semileptonic decays of charm and/or beauty hadrons are measured. At forward rapidity, muons from heavy-flavour hadron decays can be measured, since the ALICE muon spectrometer allows to identify muons by requiring that a track reconstructed in the tracking system is matched with the corresponding track candidate in the muon trigger system.

The measurement of electrons from heavy-flavour hadron decays at mid-rapidity (\u22121.06 < y cms < 0.14) requires the subtraction of contributions from several background sources from the inclusive electron distribution. The dominant contribution is from photon conversions in the detector material and Dalitz decays of light neutral mesons (\u03c0 0 and \u03b7, mainly). These contributions are statistically subtracted by using the cocktail (i.e. a calculation of the background based mainly on measured p T -differential cross sections of the main electron sources) and invariant mass (i.e. the measurement of electrons from photon conversions and Dalitz decays via low-mass electron-positron pairs) methods [3]. With the high spatial resolution of the track impact parameter measurement, one can isolate the beauty-decay contribution thanks to the much larger lifetime of beauty hadrons (c\u03c4 \u2248 500\u00b5m) compared to that of charm hadrons and other background sources. The electrons from their semileptonic decays have, consequently, a larger average impact parameter with respect to the primary interaction vertex.",

            "text": "The nuclear modification factors, R pPb , of D 0 , D + , D * + and D + s mesons are consistent with each other, and they are compatible with unity within uncertainties [5]. The pp reference cross section at \u221a s = 5.02 TeV is obtained by a pQCD-based energy scaling [11,13] of the p T -differential cross sections measured at \u221a s = 7 TeV [12]. Figure 1 (left) presents the average R pPb of prompt D 0 , D + and D * + in 1 < p T < 24 GeV/c. The R pPb can be described by means of next-to-leading-order (NLO) pQCD [14] calculations, including the EPS09 [15] nuclear modification of the CTEQ6M [16] Parton Distribution Functions (PDF) and calculations based on the Color Glass Condensate (CGC [17]) initial-state prescription. The data are also well described by calculations which include energy loss in cold nuclear matter, nuclear shadowing and k T -broadening [18]. As demonstrated in Figure 1    The nuclear modification factor of muons from heavy-flavour hadron decays, shown in Figure 3 (left), is measured in the center of mass rapidity domains 2.5 < y cms < 3.53 (forward rapidity) and \u22124 < y cms < \u22122.96 (backward rapidity). The pp reference cross section of heavy-flavour hadron decay muons at \u221a s = 5.02 TeV is obtained via a pQCD-based energy scaling procedure [13] (i.e. calculated taking as input the p T -differential cross sections measured at \u221a s = 7 TeV [19]), performed at forward and backward rapidity, respectively. This procedure is used to obtain the p T -differential cross section up to 12 GeV/c. In order to measure the R pPb in a wider transverse momentum range, the p T -differential cross section in pp collisions at \u221a s = 5.02 TeV was extrapolated to higher p T using the spectrum predicted by FONLL scaled to match the obtained pp reference in the range 6 < p T < 12 GeV/c. The R pPb measured at forward rapidity is consistent with unity within uncertainties. R pPb at backward rapidity is slightly larger than unity in the range 2 < p T < 4 GeV/c and close to unity at higher p T . This supports the previous observation that the suppression measured in the 10% most central Pb-Pb collisions at \u221a s NN = 2.76 TeV [4] results from hot and dense medium effect. Another way to quantify cold nuclear matter effects is to study the forward-to-backward ratio defined as the cross section measured at forward rapidity with respect to the one at backward rapidity, The main advantage of using such a ratio is that the pp reference and the nuclear overlap function cancel. The drawback of this approach is the limited statistics, because the common y cms interval covered at both forward and backward rapidity is small (\u223c 0.57 units).",
