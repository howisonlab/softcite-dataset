At collider energies the gaps can be large enough to be dominated by pomeron exchange, and then the quantum numbers of the state X are restricted. Isoscalar J P C = 0 ++ and 2 ++ mesons are selected, and our understanding of these spectra is incomplete. In particular, soft pomeron exchanges favor gluon-dominated states such as glueballs, which are expected in QCD",

There are many other approaches to modeling hadrons and associated phenomena at large distances, such as bag models, and string models. Regge theory is based on the sound ideas that scattering amplitudes should obey analyticity, unitarity and crossing symmetry, together with the t-channel exchange of continuous, complex angular momentum. In 1958 Pomeranchuk made a prediction from quantum field theory that total cross sections for particles and antiparticles, e.g \u03c3 T (pp) and \u03c3 T (pp), should become equal at very high energy. Total cross sections and elastic scattering are related by the optical theorem, and the implication is that the t-channel exchange in high energy elastic scattering is dominated by an isoscalar and not, e.g., by virtual \u03c0 or \u03c1 exchange, which dominate at low energy. In Regge theory the former was called the Pomeranchukon, later pomeron, IP , and the latter are reggeons, IR .. If the intercept (at t = 0) of the pomeron trajectory \u03b1 t were exactly 1.0, these cross sections would not rise with collision energy.",

            "text": "Without a demonstration that QCD underlies these large distance phenomena, including confinement of quarks and gluons, we cannot claim that QCD is a complete theory of the strong interaction. Indeed potentially new and unexpected phenomena may be revealed, either experimentally or through a theoretical breakthrough. Especially interesting is the QCD vacuum. It is no exaggeration to say: \"If we understood the vacuum, we would understand all of fundamental physics\". While this obviously applies to the Higgs sector at the smallest spacetime scales accessible at the LHC, it should also apply to the > \u223c 1 fm scale. Any isoscalar-scalar states with I G J P C = 0 + 0 ++ will be present in the vacuum as fluctuations through Heisenberg's Uncertainty Relation \u2206E.\u2206t > \u223ch (as will e + e \u2212 -loops and everything else allowed). Such virtual isoscalar states can be \"promoted\" to a real state in a high energy collision of two hadrons (e.g. pp or pp). We can call this \"diffractive excitation of the vacuum\", or double pomeron, IP , exchange, DIPE . (For unfamiliar readers, we can simply define the pomeron as the carrier of the 4-momentum exchanged between two protons scattering elastically at very high energy e.g. at the LHC, in addition to photon exchange, which dominates at very small scattering angles.) An example of double pomeron exchange is the reaction p + p \u2192 p + X + p where the protons are almost elastically scattered, carrying an outgoing momentum fraction x F > \u223c 0.95, and the central state X is isolated by rapidity gaps, with no hadrons, \u2206y > \u223c 3 (\u2206y > \u223c 4 or 5 would be better!). The scattered (anti)proton may diffractively dissociate into a low-mass state (p * ) provided the longitudinal momentum of p * has x F > \u223c 0.95.",

The M (\u03c0\u03c0) spectrum rises from threshold up to 1000 MeV, with no sign of a \u03c1-meson (forbidden in DIPE ), and then drops rapidly, see Figure 1(right). This behavior is called a \"cusp\", occuring when the KK threshold opens, but the narrow f 0 (980) meson occurs at nearly the same mass. A bump in the cross section looks like the f 0 (1270) state, but a partial wave analysis showed that the J = 2 D-wave is dominated there by J = 0 S-wave. This raised the suggestion [29] that the data all the way up to 1500 MeV, where there is a break, may be dominated by the f 0 (500)/\u03c3, a very broad (\u0393 = (400 -700) MeV) I G J P C = 0 + 0 ++ (poorly understood) state, destructively interfering with the f 0 (980) to form a dip.",

In the last months before the Tevatron shut down (30 September 2011) CDF recorded 10 8 events with two forward rapidity gaps, and two or more charged particles in the central region [35]. Of these, 127,340 events had a pair of hadrons with Q = 0, p T > 0.4 GeV/c, and |\u03b7| < 1.0 and nothing else detected in |\u03b7| < 5.9. When the p T of the pair is large enough to have acceptance for low-mass pairs, the f 0 (980) is seen as a small peak followed by a sharp drop, as typical in these spectra, and it is followed by a large peak, see Figure 2, which is probably both f 2 (1270) and f 0 (1370), although unfortunately the spin states could not be separated.",

This could actually be done in a few days of low pileup running at the LHC with special triggers.
