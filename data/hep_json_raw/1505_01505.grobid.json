Such interference occurs when the neutral D meson is reconstructed in a final state that is accessible to bothD 0 and D 0 decays and therefore corresponds to an admixture of the two states [5,6]. One of the largest components of the B 0 \u2192 DK \u00fe \u03c0 \u2212 final state is B 0 \u2192 DK \u00c3 \u00f0892\u00de 0 , for which bothb \u2192cus andb \u2192\u016bcs amplitudes are color suppressed, making them comparable in magnitude and potentially enhancing CP violation effects [7]. Decay diagrams for the quasi-two-body contributions from B 0 \u2192 DK \u00c3 \u00f0892\u00de 0 and B 0 \u2192 D \u00c3 2 \u00f02460\u00de \u2212 K \u00fe decays are shown in Fig. 1. Observables sensitive to \u03b3 have been measured by LHCb with a quasi-two-body approach [8], but a DP analysis is expected to be more sensitive because interference between resonances provides the possibility to resolve ambiguities in the determination of \u03b3.",

Results in this area have recently been obtained from DP analyses of B 0 s \u2192D 0 K \u2212 \u03c0 \u00fe [9,10], B \u00fe \u2192 D \u2212 K \u00fe \u03c0 \u00fe [11] and B 0 \u2192 D 0 \u03c0 \u00fe \u03c0 \u2212 [12] decays, all from LHCb. As the branching fraction for B 0 \u2192D 0 K \u00fe \u03c0 \u2212 decays is smaller than that for B 0 \u2192D 0 \u03c0 \u00fe \u03c0 \u2212 decays, the analysis presented in this paper is not as sensitive to the parameters of charm resonances as that of Ref.

However, the much larger sample of B mesons available at LHCb compared to that used in the only other published DP analysis of B 0 \u2192D 0 \u03c0 \u00fe \u03c0 \u2212 decays from the Belle Collaboration [13] allows useful results on excited charm mesons to be obtained. Moreover, results on charm meson spectroscopy obtained from DP analysis of B 0 \u2192D 0 K \u00fe \u03c0 \u2212 decays provide important independent cross-checks of results from studies of the B 0 \u2192 D 0 \u03c0 \u00fe \u03c0 \u2212 DP, as possible biases due to other structures in the Dalitz plots are different between the two modes.",

The detector includes a high-precision tracking system consisting of a silicon-strip vertex detector [20] surrounding the pp interaction region, a large-area silicon-strip detector located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4 Tm, and three stations of silicon-strip detectors and straw drift tubes [21] placed downstream of the magnet. The polarity of the dipole magnet is reversed periodically throughout data taking. The tracking system provides a measurement of momentum, p, of charged particles with a relative uncertainty that varies from 0.5% at low momentum to 1.0% at 200 GeV (natural units with c \u00bc \u210f \u00bc 1 are used). The minimum distance of a track to a primary vertex, the impact parameter (IP), is measured with a resolution of \u00f015 \u00fe 29=p T \u00de \u03bcm, where p T is the component of the momentum transverse to the beam, in GeV. Different types of charged hadrons are distinguished using information from two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors [22]. Photon, electron and hadron candidates are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter and a hadronic calorimeter. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers [23].",

The software trigger used in this analysis requires a two-, three-or four-track secondary vertex with significant displacement from any primary pp interaction vertex (PV). At least one charged particle must have p T > 1.7 GeV and be inconsistent with originating from a PV.

Simulated samples are used to obtain the shape for B 0 \u2192 D \u00c30 K \u00fe \u03c0 \u2212 decays, with theD \u00c30 \u2192D 0 \u03b3 andD 0 \u03c0 0 contributions generated in the correct proportions [37]. To account for differences between simulation and data, for example in the polarization of theD \u00c30 meson, the B candidate invariant mass distribution for partially reconstructed B 0 \u2192D \u00c30 K \u00fe \u03c0 \u2212 decays is allowed to be shifted by an offset that is a free parameter of the fit. The misidentified background shapes are also obtained from simulated samples. For B 0 \u2192D \u00f0\u00c3\u00de0 \u03c0 \u00fe \u03c0 \u2212 decays theD 0 andD \u00c30 contributions are combined according to their relative branching fractions [37]. The backgrounds from\u039b 0 b \u2192 D \u00f0\u00c3\u00de0 K \u00fep and B 0 \u00f0s\u00de \u2192D \u00f0\u00c3\u00de0 K \u00fe K \u2212 decays are assumed to have equal branching fractions for the decays withD 0 and D \u00c30 mesons in the final state, as the decays involvingD \u00c30 mesons have not yet been measured. The simulated samples are reweighted according to the relevant particle identification and misidentification probabilities and to match known DP distributions [12,[39][40][41]. The (mis) identification probabilities take account of track kinematics and are calculated using calibration samples of [19,22]. The yields of the misidentified backgrounds relative to the signal are constrained, within uncertainties, to their expected values based on their known branching fractions [12,39,40] and misidentification probabilities.",

A spin-3 resonance has also been seen at m\u00f0D 0 \u03c0 \u2212 \u00de \u223c 2.76 GeV in B 0 \u2192D 0 \u03c0 \u00fe \u03c0 \u2212 decays [12], while an analysis of B \u00fe \u2192 D \u2212 K \u00fe \u03c0 \u00fe shows a spin-1 resonance at similar m\u00f0D \u00fe \u03c0 \u2212 \u00de values [11]. Uncertainties are assigned corresponding to the changes in results when either a spin-1 or spin-3 state at m\u00f0D 0 \u03c0 \u2212 \u00de \u223c 2.76 GeV is added to the nominal model. The LASS model used to describe the K\u03c0 S-wave is replaced with a Flatt\u00e9 shape [55], which accounts for the K\u03b7 0 threshold near the K \u00c3 0 \u00f01430\u00de 0 mass, and a resonant term with a modified mass-dependent width [52] for the \u03ba [also known as K \u00c3 0 \u00f0800\u00de] state. This model gives an NLL that is worse by 4.4 units. A model-independent description of the K\u03c0 S-wave is also used to fit the data, with the uncertainty on each parameter taken as the larger of the two differences. This alternative improves the NLL by 8.8 units but introduces an additional four free parameters into the fit. The dabba line shape used to describe theD 0 \u03c0 \u2212 S-wave is replaced with an EFF line shape, while a power-law model is introduced as an alternative to the EFF line shape that describes theD 0 \u03c0 \u2212 P-wave. These alterations worsen the NLL by 3.0 units and improve it by 0.8 units respectively. The total systematic uncertainties due to experimental and model effects for fit fractions and complex coefficients are given together with the results in Sec. VIII. The contributions from different sources to the systematic uncertainties on the fit fractions, masses and widths are given in Tables V and VI. The dominant experimental systematic uncertainty on most parameters is due to either the efficiency variation or background distributions across the SDP, while the model uncertainties are generally dominated by the effects of alternative descriptions of the K\u03c0 S-wave and the D\u03c0 S-and P-waves. For the parameters of broad components, the model uncertainties dominate; however for other parameters the statistical, experimental and model uncertainties are all of a similar magnitude.",

These are consistent with, though less precise than, recent results from a DP analysis of B 0 \u2192D 0 \u03c0 \u00fe \u03c0 \u2212 decays [12]. They also show good agreement with, and have similar precision to, earlier measurements of these quantities [13,37]. In summary, the first amplitude analysis of B 0 \u2192 D 0 K \u00fe \u03c0 \u2212 decays has been presented, using a data sample corresponding to 3.0 fb \u22121 of pp collision data collected by the LHCb experiment. A good description of the data is obtained with a model containing contributions from intermediate K \u00c3 \u00f0892\u00de 0 , K \u00c3 \u00f01410\u00de 0 , K \u00c3 2 \u00f01430\u00de 0 and D \u00c3 2 \u00f02460\u00de \u2212 resonances, with additional components to describe broad structures in the K\u03c0 S-wave and the D\u03c0 S-and P-waves. The masses and widths of the D \u00c3 0 \u00f02400\u00de \u2212 and D \u00c3 2 \u00f02460\u00de \u2212 resonances are measured, as are the complex amplitudes and fit fractions for all components included in the amplitude model. The results can be used in conjunction with an analysis of B 0 \u2192 DK \u00fe \u03c0 \u2212 decays, where the neutral D meson is reconstructed in final states such as K \u00fe K \u2212 , to measure the CKM unitarity triangle parameter \u03b3 [1,2].
