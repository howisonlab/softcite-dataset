The analysis is based on data collected at the LHC and corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 1.23 pb \u22121 . Quarkonia are reconstructed in the dimuon-decay channel. The differential production cross sections are measured as a function of the transverse momentum p T and rapidity y, over the p T ranges 0 < p T < 20 GeV/c for J/\u03c8, 0 < p T < 12 GeV/c for all other resonances, and for 2.5 < y < 4. The cross sections, integrated over p T and y, and assuming unpolarized quarkonia, are \u03c3 J/\u03c8 = 8.98 \u00b1 0.04 \u00b1 0.82 \u00b5b, \u03c3 \u03c8(2S) = 1.23 \u00b1 0.08 \u00b1 0.22 \u00b5b, \u03c3 \u03d2(1S) = 71 \u00b1 6 \u00b1 7 nb, \u03c3 \u03d2(2S) = 26 \u00b1 5 \u00b1 4 nb and \u03c3 \u03d2(3S) = 9 \u00b1 4 \u00b1 1 nb, where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second one is systematic. These values agree, within at most 1.4\u03c3 , with measurements performed by the LHCb collaboration in the same rapidity range.",

There are mainly three approaches used to describe quarkonium production, which differ mostly in the way the produced heavyquark pair evolves into the bound state: the Color Evaporation Model [1,2], the Color Singlet Model [3] and Non-Relativistic QCD [4]. To date, none of these approaches is able to describe consistently all data available on quarkonium production [5,6]. e-mail: alice-publications@cern.ch",

Our measurement extends the transverse momentum reach of the J/\u03c8 cross section from p T = 12 GeV/c up to p T = 20 GeV/c with respect to results from LHCb [7]. The \u03c8(2S) results are the first published at this energy. For \u03d2 mesons, differential cross sections at forward rapidity and \u221a s = 8 TeV have already been published by LHCb [8]. Our measurement provides a unique cross-check of these results. Moreover, it is the first time ALICE measures the \u03d2(3S) cross section. All cross sections reported here are inclusive and contain, on top of the direct production of the quarkonium, a contribution from the decay of higher-mass excited states. Charmonium (J/\u03c8 and \u03c8(2S)) cross sections also contain a contribution from b-hadron decay.",

It is used to detect muons produced in the pseudo-rapidity range \u22124 < \u03b7 < \u22122.5. 1 The third tracking station is located inside a warm 3 T m dipole magnet, to allow for momentum measurements. This apparatus is completed by two absorbers that filter out hadrons and low p T muons, positioned (i) between the Interaction Point (IP) and the first tracking station, and (ii) between the last tracking station and the first trigger station. A third absorber, surrounding the beam pipe, protects the detectors from secondary particles produced inside the beam pipe. The MTR system delivers single-or di-muon triggers, of either same or opposite sign, with a programmable threshold on the transverse momentum of each muon. The ITS consists of 6 layers of silicon detectors, placed at radii ranging from 3.9 to 43 cm from the beam axis. Its two innermost layers are equipped with Silicon Pixel Detectors (SPD) and cover the pseudo-rapidity ranges |\u03b7| < 2 and |\u03b7| < 1.4 for the inner and the outer layer, respectively. They are used for the reconstruction of the collision primary vertex. The V0 detectors are two scintillator arrays located on both sides of the IP and covering the pseudo-rapidity ranges \u22123.7 < \u03b7 < \u22121.7 and 2.8 < \u03b7 < 5.1. The T0 detectors are two arrays of quartz Cherenkov counters, also placed at forward rapidity on both sides of the IP and covering the pseudo-rapidity ranges \u22123.3 < \u03b7 < \u22123 and 4.6 < \u03b7 < 4.9. The coincidence of a signal in both sides of either the T0 or the V0 detectors is used as an interaction trigger and as input for the luminosity determination.",

For the background component, either a pseudo-Gaussian function whose width varies linearly with the invariant mass or the product of an exponential function and a fourth order polynomial function have been used, with all parameters left free in the fit. For the signal, the sum of either two extended Crystal Ball functions (one for each resonance) or two pseudo-Gaussian functions have been used [18]. Both functions (Crystal Ball or pseudo-Gaussian) consist of a Gaussian core, to which parametrized tails are added on both sides, which fall off slower than for a Gaussian function. Due to the poor signal-to-background (S/B) ratio in the tail regions, the values of the parameters that enter the definition of these tails have been evaluated using Monte Carlo (MC) simulations described later in this section, and kept fixed in the fit. The J/\u03c8 and \u03c8(2S) signals are fitted simultaneously. For the J/\u03c8, the mass, width and normalization of the signal function are left free. For the \u03c8(2S), only the normalization is free, whereas the mass and the width are calculated from the values obtained for the J/\u03c8 : the mass is computed so that the difference with respect to the J/\u03c8 mass is the same as quoted by the PDG [16]; the width is derived from the J/\u03c8 width using a scale factor of about 1.1, estimated in MC simulations and validated with fits to the p T -and y-integrated invariant mass distributions from the data, with both widths left free. An example of fit to the p T -and y-integrated dimuon invariant mass distribution in the J/\u03c8 and \u03c8(2S) mass region is shown in the left panel of Fig. 1. The result from this fit is used for the computation of the charmonium cross sections quoted at the beginning of Sect. 4.",

These contributions have been evaluated using the same procedures as in [17], for the first one by utilizing several alternative input p T and y distributions, and for the other three by comparing data and MC at the single muon level and propagating the resulting differences to the dimuon case. The resulting systematic uncertainty is the quadratic sum of these contributions. It is partially correlated as a function of both p T and y.

For J/\u03c8, the correction amounts to about 1 % on the p Tand y-integrated yield. It increases from 0.6 % to 8 % with increasing p T and shows little dependence on y. Slightly larger values are obtained for \u03d2(1S) albeit with larger uncertainties.
