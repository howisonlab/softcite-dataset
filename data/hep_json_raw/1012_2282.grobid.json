At present there are two complementary approaches to address this topic in laboratory experiments. The search for neutrinoless double beta decay probes whether neutrinos are Majorana particles and determines an effective neutrino mass value. On the other hand experiments such as MARE, KATRIN and the recently proposed Project 8 will investigate the spectral shape of \u03b2-decay electrons close to their kinematic endpoint in order to determine the neutrino rest mass with a model-independent method. Here, because of neutrino flavour mixing, the neutrino mass appears as an average of all neutrino mass eigenstates contributing to the electron neutrino. The KArlsruhe TRItium Neutrino experiment (KATRIN) is currently the experiment in the most advanced status of commissioning. It combines an ultra-luminous molecular windowless gaseous tritium source with an integrating high-resolution spectrometer of MAC-E filter type. It will investigate the neutrino rest mass with 0.2 eV/c 2 (90% C.L.) sensitivity and allow \u03b2 spectroscopy close to the T 2 endpoint at 18.6 keV with unprecedented precision.",

            "text": "Ever since Pauli postulated the Neutrino, its influence and significance for particle physics as well as for astrophysics has steadily been growing. The observation of flavour oscillations of atmospheric and solar neutrinos, as well as of reactor and accelerator neutrinos at long baseline, is a compelling evidence that neutrinos are massive. Due to this fact and owing to their large abundance in the universe, neutrinos are considered as the primary candidate for hot dark matter in cosmology. Thus, they could play an important role for the evolution of large scale structures (LSS) in the universe. On the other hand, the on-going investigations of neutrino properties, their mass hierarchy and especially their rest mass will open a door to the understanding of the origin of mass. Here, a precision measurement of the neutrino rest mass can discriminate between different \u03bdmass models, in particular whether they are of hierarchical type (m 1 m 2 m 3 ) or of quasi-degenerate type (m 1 m 2 m 3 ). Although experiments on neu-trino flavour oscillation provide compelling evidence that neutrinos are massive, they cannot provide an absolute mass value. Therefore, other methods have to be applied.",

Here, the sum of all neutrino mass eigenstates is being measured, since in cosmological processes the flavour cannot be distinguished. Using only WMAP7 data, an upper limit of 1.2 eV/c 2 is determined for the sum of neutrino mass eigenstates [1]. Upcoming data from the Planck satellite as well as from LSST and weak lensing surveys have the potential of probing the sum of neutrino masses with 50 meV/c 2 sensitivity. However, while cosmologcal studies offer a very sensitive approach, one has to emphasize its generic model dependence, which easily leads to a factor of 2 of uncertainty in the neutrino mass prediction [2].",

An overview of the main beam-line is given in figure 1. The MAC-E filter uses magnetic adiabatic collimation in combination with an electrostatic energy filter. Electrons emitted in the source at high magnetic field enter the spectrometer, where the magnetic field drops by several orders of magnitude. Maintaining a strictly adiabatic regime with full energy conservation, the magnetic gradient force transforms the cyclotron energy of the isotropically emitted electrons into the longitudinal component. At the same time, the increasing potential of the electrostatic filter slows down the electrons by reducing their longitudinal energy. Both effects have to be aligned very carefully for a proper energy analysis. Only electrons which are able to cross the potential in the spectrometer are counted, thus the MAC-E filter acts as high-pass filter for electrons. Its relative resolution is defined by the magnetic field ratio between minimum field in the center of the spectrometer and maximum field at the pinch magnet. This defines the overall electromagnetic design of KATRIN and the size of its components.",

Even tiny cm 3 -sized Penning-like traps close to the ground electrode can cause background rates of > 10 3 cps.
