            "text": "For a resonance decaying to \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 , it is difficult to reconstruct its mass accurately because of the presence of neutrinos in the decay products of the \u03c4 leptons. If the resonance is heavy enough, we show that its mass can be well determined by the momentum component of the \u03c4 decay products perpendicular to the velocity of the \u03c4 lepton, p \u22a5 , and the mass of the visible/invisible decay products, m vis/inv , for \u03c4 decaying to hadrons/leptons. By sampling all kinematically allowed values of p \u22a5 and m vis/inv according to their joint probability distributions determined by the MC simulations, the mass of the mother resonance is assumed to lie at the position with the maximal probability. Since p \u22a5 and m vis/inv are invariant under the boost in the \u03c4 lepton direction, the joint probability distributions are independent upon \u03c4's origin. Thus this technique is able to determine the mass of an unknown resonance with no efficiency loss. It is tested using the MC simulations of the physics processes pp \u2192 Z/h(125)/h(750) + X \u2192 \u03c4\u03c4 + X at 13 TeV. The ratio of the full width at half maximum and the peak value of the reconstructed mass distribution is found to be 20%-40% using the information of missing transverse energy.",

            "text": "Following the discovery of the Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson [1,2], it is of more interest to search for new high-mass particles, such as additional Higgs bosons [3][4][5][6]. Recently, in the \u03b3\u03b3 mass spectrum, a resonance around the mass 750 GeV/c 2 is seen with a significance of about 3\u03c3 [7,8]. In the SM and many beyond-SM theories, the coupling of the Higgs boson and the fermion is proportional to the mass of the fermion. For a neutral Higgs boson, h 0 , the branching fraction of h 0 \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 would be dominant compared to other leptons e and \u00b5. Experimentally, the presence of neutrinos makes it challenging to reconstruct the invariant mass M (\u03c4\u03c4) accurately [9,10]. Accordingly, the performance of the mass reconstruction technique affects the sensitivity of probing new physics.",

Experimentally, the visible decay product is the charged lepton (e, \u00b5) or the hadron(s) while the invisible decay product is the neutrino(s). For the charged leptons, the momentum can be measured well by the tracking system. For the hadronic decay products, they are reconstructed from the energy clusters in the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters using the anti-k t jet finding algorithm [11,12]. One of the characteristics is the presence of one or three charged tracks accompanied by possibly neutral hadrons, which lead to a collimated shower in the calorimeters with a few nearby tracks. The energy deposits in the calorimeters are used to reconstruct the four-momenta of the hadronic \u03c4 candidates. Both the tracking and calorimeter information are combined to identify the hadronic \u03c4 decays and suppress the misidentification rate of jets.",

If only the neutrinos from the \u03c4 decays contribute to the missing energy, / E obs x/y can then be used to improve the M (\u03c4\u03c4) reconstruction, as will be shown below. Here we only use the transverse part of the missing energy. This is because in the hadron colliders, the interaction happens among the colliding partons. The partons in the high-boosting hadrons, such as proton, would have momenta collinear with the original momentum of the proton, and thus the initial transverse momenta are negligible [13]. It should be noted that the pileup effect would worsen the measurement of the missing transverse energy. For the CMS detector, the determination of the missing energy can be improved to have a resolution of 10-15 GeV [9] based on the data taken at 8 TeV using the particle-flow technique [14]. For the ATLAS detector, a track-based soft term (TST) [15] is adopted to mitigate the pileup effect and the missing transverse energy can be determined with a resolution of 10-20 GeV based on a small fraction of the data taken in 2015 [16].",

We will compare this method with the CAT, MMC and SVFIT, as the TMM only reconstructs M (\u03c4\u03c4) partially. In Sec. 2, we present the principle of this method. In Sec. 3, the method is tested on the MC simulations. In Sec. 4, we apply the selection criteria used by the ATLAS Collaboration in searching for the SM Higgs decaying to the \u03c4 pair [10] to a MC sample of pp \u2192 h(125)+X \u2192 \u03c4\u03c4+X via the gluon-gluon fusion process.

            "text": "In the leptonic decay mode \u03c4 l , we do not distinguish the charged leptons e and \u00b5 as their masses are negligible compared to the \u03c4 mass. In the hadronic decay mode \u03c4 h , the events with one charged track and three charged tracks are considered separately. Events with two \u03c4 candidates, charged leptons or hadronic \u03c4 jets, with opposite charge sign are selected. The transverse momentum, p T , is required to be larger than 20 GeV/c and the rapidity |\u03b7| is required to be less than 2.5 for both \u03c4 candidates. They are further required to be isolated. The charged leptons satisfy p T (\u2206R = 0.5)/p T (l) < 10%. Here p T (l) is the transverse momentum of the lepton and p T (\u2206R = 0.5) is the transverse momentum of the additional observed objects in the cone around the lepton candidate, where the cone size is defined by the angular distance between the additional objects and the lepton candidate \u2206R = 0.5. For a hadronic \u03c4 candidate, the angular distance with respect to an electron or a muon is required to be larger than 0.2. Experimentally, additional isolation conditions are imposed on the hadronic \u03c4 candidates to reduce the jet faking rate. For example, the ATLAS collaboration uses the discriminating variables based on the tracks with p T > 1 GeV/c and the energy deposited in the calorimeter in the cone \u2206R < 0.2 and those in the region 0.2 < \u2206R < 0.4 around the hadronic \u03c4 candidate's direction [10]. Here in the delphes simulation, no further isolation condition is used for the hadronic \u03c4s.",

The final reconstructed distributions of M (\u03c4\u03c4) for Z/h(125)/h(750) \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 are shown in Fig. 4, Fig. 5 and Fig. 6 respectively. For each resonance, we also present the results based on the JPDs P(p \u22a5 , m vis/inv ) from         the simulation of the other resonances. In fact, the JPDs describe the decay kinematics of the \u03c4 lepton and have nothing to do with the resonance decaying to \u03c4 lepton pairs. Therefore, we can reconstruct the mass of an unknown resonances based on the JPDs from an known resonance. As Fig. 4, Fig. 5 and Fig. 6 shows, the performance are nearly the same no matter what JPDs are used. We adopt two quantities to measure the performance, namely, the reconstruction efficiency due to the technique itself and the relative mass resolution. They are crucial elements to search for new resonances and distinguish the resonance signal from the background. They are explained below.",

            "text": "In summary, we propose a new technique to reconstruct the mass of a heavy resonance decaying to \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 . It is based on the collinear approximation \u03b8 \u03c4 1 \u03c4 2 \u03b8 vis 1 ,vis 2 . The mass M (\u03c4\u03c4) can be determined with given (p \u22a5 , m vis/inv ) for the \u03c4 leptons. Through sampling (p \u22a5 , m vis/inv ) according to their joint probability distributions, the reconstructed mass is assumed to correspond to the value with the maximal probability. This method utilizes the fact that the quantities p \u22a5 and m vis/inv are invariant under the boost in the direction of the \u03c4 lepton. Based on the MC simulations of pp \u2192 Z/h(125)/h(750) + X \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 + X, this method gives a relative mass resolution, FHWM/m peak 20%-40% using the information of missing energy with no efficiency loss. In the end, we would like to comment that this method would work better in the Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC), since the well-determined initial four-momenta of the colliding beams provide more kinematic constraints.",
