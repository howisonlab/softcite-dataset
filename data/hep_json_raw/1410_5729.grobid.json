The investigation of the B + c meson properties (charge conjugation is implied throughout this paper) is of special interest compared to the flavor symmetric heavy-quarkonium (bb, cc) states, and provides a new testing ground for predictions in the context of effective models inspired by quantum chromodynamics [1]. The decay processes of the B + c meson can be generically divided into three classes: those involving the decay of the b quark, the decay of the c quark, and the annihilation of the b and c quarks [1][2][3]. The b \u2192 c transition, accounting for about 20% of the decay rate [1], offers an easily accessible experimental signature, having a high probability of producing a J/\u03c8 meson. Consequently, the first B + c observation was made in the semileptonic channel B + c \u2192 J/\u03c8 + \u03bd ( = e, \u00b5) by the CDF Collaboration [4]. Information on the production and decays of the B + c meson and its possible excited states is quite limited. Production characteristics have been studied at the Tevatron for p T > 4 GeV and |y| < 1 and by LHCb in the kinematic region p T > 4 GeV, 2.5 < \u03b7 < 4.5.",

Within the superconducting solenoid volume are silicon pixel and strip trackers, a crystal electromagnetic calorimeter, and a brass/scintillator hadron calorimeter. Muons are measured in gas-ionization detectors embedded in the steel return yoke. The subdetectors relevant for this analysis are the silicon tracker and the muon systems. The inner tracker measures charged particles within the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 2.5. It consists of layers totaling 66 million 100\u00d7150 \u00b5m 2 silicon pixels and 9.6 million silicon strips with pitches ranging from 80 to 183 \u00b5m. Muons are measured in the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 2.4 with detection planes constructed using three technologies: drift tubes, cathode strip chambers, and resistive-plate chambers. The first level of the CMS trigger system, composed of custom hardware processors, uses information from the calorimeters and muon detectors to select the most interesting events in a fixed time interval of less than 4 \u00b5s. The high level trigger processor farm further decreases the event rate from around 100 kHz to approximately 400 Hz before data storage.

The track must not be identified as a muon. The B + c \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c0 + \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 candidates are analogously formed by combining a J/\u03c8 candidate with three tracks, assuming that they are pions and requiring that the total charge is +1. The pion (kaon) candidates are required to have a track fit \u03c7 2 less than three times the number of degrees of freedom; \u22656 tracker hits; \u22652 pixel hits; |\u03b7| < 2.4; and p T > 0.9 GeV. The three-dimensional impact parameter between each pion (kaon) and the J/\u03c8 vertex is required to be less than 6 times its uncertainty to reduce combinatorial background and the effect of the number of simultaneous pp interactions per bunch crossing (pileup). The decay vertex is reconstructed using a kinematic vertex fit [21], which constrains the invariant mass of the two muons to the nominal J/\u03c8 mass. After the vertex fit, the track parameters are re-estimated at the fitted vertex to improve their resolution. To reduce backgrounds, only the highest-transverse-momentum B + c or B + candidate is retained per event. This method has been studied using the MC samples and found to select the right candidate in 99.3% (99.2%) of the B + c \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c0 + (B + \u2192 J/\u03c8K + ) events and 91% of the B + c \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c0 + \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 events. In the B + c \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c0 + \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 data sample, this requirement reduces the background by more than a factor of four.",

An additional contribution is considered coming from the choice of the seven-dimensional efficiency parametrization of eq. (72). To estimate this contribution, data are alternatively weighted according to the efficiency distribution directly obtained from the MC samples, binned in the seven two-body submasses. The difference between the ratio measured using the binned efficiency distribution and the function in eq. (72) is taken as a systematic uncertainty (1.0%). In the evaluation of R Bc , two different multiplicity final states are compared. Assuming a tracking efficiency uncertainty for each pion track of 3.9% [26], a global 7.8% uncertainty is included in the final systematic evaluation. The total systematic uncertainty in the ratio, obtained by adding all the contributions in quadrature, is 13.1%.",

            "text": "A measurement of the ratio of the cross sections times branching fractions for B + c \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c0 + and B + \u2192 J/\u03c8K + has been presented based on pp collision data at a center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV collected by the CMS experiment and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 5.1 fb \u22121 . The analysis, performed for B + c and B + mesons with p T > 15 GeV and in the central rapidity region |y| < 1.6, gives a measured ratio of A similar measurement from LHCb in the kinematic region p T > 4 GeV, 2.5 < \u03b7 < 4.5 gives [0.68 \u00b1 0.10 (stat) \u00b1 0.03 (syst) \u00b1 0.05 (\u03c4 Bc )]% [27]. The two measurements, performed in different kinematic regions, are expected to differ because of the softer p T distribution of the B + c with respect to that of the B + , implying a lower value of the ratio at higher p T . The measurements are consistent with this expectation. Measurements of the production cross section times branching fraction for B + c \u2192 J/\u03c8 + \u03bd relative to that for B + \u2192 J/\u03c8K + are also available from the CDF experiment [4] in the kinematic region p T > 4 GeV and |y| < 1. With the present B + c (p T ,|y|) coverage, these experimental results can give guidance to improve the theoretical calculations still affected by large uncertainties and constrain the various B + c production models. The ratio of the B + c \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c0 + \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and B + c \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c0 + branching fractions has been measured to be R Bc = 2.55 \u00b1 0.80 (stat) \u00b1 0.33 (syst) +0.04 \u22120.01 (\u03c4 Bc ), (8.2) which is in good agreement with the result from the LHCb experiment, 2.41 \u00b1 0.30 (stat)\u00b10.33 (syst) [10], and represents its first confirmation. This measurement can be compared with the theoretical predictions, which assume factorization into B + c \u2192 J/\u03c8W + * and W + * \u2192 n\u03c0 + (n = 1, 2, 3, 4). In particular, ref. [28] predicts 1.5 for the ratio, whereas -9 -JHEP01(2015)063 ref. [29] predicts three different values, 1.9, 2.0, and 2.3, depending on the chosen set of B + c meson form factors. More precise measurements are needed to determine if one of the predictions is favored by the data. The model-independent method implemented for the efficiency evaluation of the five-body final state can be considered in future high-statistics analyses to reduce systematic uncertainties associated with the unknown multibody decay dynamics.",
