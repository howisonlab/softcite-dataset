            "text": "Measurements of K 0 S and 0 production in tt final states have been performed. They are based on a data sample with integrated luminosity of 4.6 fb \u22121 from protonproton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV, collected in 2011 with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. Neutral strange particles are separated into three classes, depending on whether they are contained in a jet, with or without a b-tag, or not associated with a selected jet. The aim is to look for differences in their main kinematic distributions. A comparison of data with several Monte Carlo simulations using different hadronisation and fragmentation schemes, colour reconnection models and different tunes for the underlying event has been made. The production of neutral strange particles in tt dileptonic events is found to be well described by current Monte Carlo models for K 0 S and 0 production within jets, but not for those produced outside jets.",

            "text": "Neutral strange particle production has been studied in collider experiments using e + e \u2212 [1-11], pp [12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19], pp [20][21][22], ep [23,24] and heavy-ion collisions [25,26], as well as in fixed-target experiments [27][28][29][30][31][32][33][34][35][36][37][38][39][40]. These measurements provide interesting tests of theoretical jet fragmentation functions [41] and can be used to validate and tune the values of empirical parameters used in the parton shower and fragmentation parts of the Monte Carlo (MC) models. Since the mass of the strange quark is comparable to the QCD scale parameter QCD , perturbative calculations cannot be performed. These models must be highly accurate to constrain the underlying event (UE) effects in the high transverse momentum ( p T ) production investigated at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In particular the ratio \u03b3 s = s/u, giving the suppression factor of strange to non-strange meson production in the hadronic final states, is measured to be larger in pp collisions than in e + e \u2212 annihilation. A review is given in Ref. [42].",

Recent data from RHIC [25,44] tend to support these ideas and show that neutral strange particle production is enhanced. In pp collisions at LHC energies, many overlapping strings due to multi-parton interactions are also expected to come into play, so that higher rates of strange meson and baryon production are expected [42]. This effect was confirmed recently by the ALICE [16] and CMS [15] collaborations.",

Section 6 shows the results at the detector level compared with MC generator simulations. Neutral strange particle production is studied in terms of distributions of transverse momentum, pseudorapidity, energy and multiplicity for the three cases stated above. Section 7 discusses the efficiency correction calculations and the statistical error propagation. Section 8 gives details of the main systematic uncertainties. Section 9 shows the results corrected to the particle level compared with the predictions of different MC models, thus checking the model-dependence of neutral strange particle production in these events.

The calorimeter system covers the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 4.9. The electromagnetic section, covering the region |\u03b7| < 3.2, uses liquid argon as the active material in barrel and endcap calorimeters with accordionshaped electrodes and lead absorbers. The hadronic calorimeter system consists of a steel/scintillator-tile barrel calorimeter (|\u03b7| < 1.7) and a copper liquid-argon endcap (1.7 < |\u03b7| < 3.2). In addition, a forward calorimeter consisting of liquid argon with copper and tungsten for the absorbers extends the pseudorapidity coverage to |\u03b7| = 4.9. The muon spectrometer, located inside a toroidal magnetic field, provides triggering and muon tracking capabilities in the ranges |\u03b7| < 2.4 and |\u03b7| < 2.7 respectively. This allows identification of muons with momenta above 3 GeV and precision determination of the muon transverse momentum up to 1 TeV.

The method numerically calculates the inverse of the migration matrices for each of the distributions under study.

The resulting matrices exhibit a very pronounced diagonal correlation. The number of iterations is chosen such that the residual bias, evaluated through a closure test as discussed in Sect. 8, is within a tolerance of 1% for the statistically significant bins as in Ref.

For kinematic quantities such as the transverse momentum and pseudorapidity, they can be expressed as the deviation of the efficiency ratios from unity. These systematic uncertainties range up to 20-25%, or even to 50% for the tails of the multiplicity distributions, and thus represent the dominant source of systematic uncertainty. The choice of parton shower (PS) and hadronisation scheme plays the predominant role, as tested by comparing the efficiencies calculated with Powheg + Pythia6 and Powheg + Herwig samples. The matrix element (ME) calculation method plays a minor role, as seen when comparing the efficiencies calculated with Powheg + Herwig and MC@NLO + Herwig samples. \u2022 The systematic uncertainty related to pile-up: as a first attempt to check how well the MC pile-up modelling describes the data, mass distributions for K 0 S and candidates are obtained for two samples of events depending on whether the average number of interactions per bunch crossing, \u03bc , is higher or lower than the median ( \u03bc = 8.36). This exercise shows that neutral strange particles embedded in jets, with or without a b-tag, are not at all affected by pile-up. This is not the case for neu- tral strange particles outside jets, for which a clear linear dependence on \u03bc is observed. In order to estimate the systematic uncertainty associated with this class, a datadriven procedure is developed, which compares the \u03bc dependence of the K 0 S multiplicity observed in data and MC events at high longitudinal impact parameter values. The resulting systematic uncertainty is found to be of the order of 8%.",

The resulting uncertainties from both the JES and JER are found to be well below 5%. \u2022 The b-tagging efficiency: in order to study the systematic uncertainty due to the choice of b-tagging efficiency, the analysis was repeated using two alternative b-tagging efficiencies of 60% and 85%. The obvious effect of this is that the number of jets classified as b-tagged (or not) changes. However, as shown in Figs. 3 and 4, the distributions for K 0 S production inside b-tagged jets are very similar to those for K 0 S production inside non-b-tagged jets, so the uncertainties for normalised distributions are expected to be small. The average multiplicity for K 0 S production per b-tagged jet (or non-b-tagged jet) is found to be independent of the choice of b-tagging working point within the statistical uncertainty. Thus the systematic uncertainty due to the choice of b-tagging efficiency is negligible.",
