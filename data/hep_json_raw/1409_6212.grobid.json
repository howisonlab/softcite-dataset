            "text": "For decades, the Higgs boson [1][2][3][4] of the Standard Model (SM) remained an unconfirmed prediction. In July 2012, the ATLAS and CMS experiments at the LHC reported the observation of a new particle with a mass of about 125 GeV and with properties consistent with those expected for the SM Higgs boson [5,6]. Since then, more precise measurements have strengthened the hypothesis that the new particle is indeed a Higgs boson [7][8][9]. These measurements, however, have been mainly performed in the bosonic decay modes of the new particle (H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3, H \u2192 ZZ, and H \u2192 W W ). It is also essential to verify whether it decays into fermions as predicted by the Standard Model. Recently, the CMS Collaboration reported evidence for the \u03c4 \u03c4 decay mode of the Higgs boson at a level of significance of 3.4 standard deviations (\u03c3) for m H = 125 GeV [10].",

Accessing H \u2192 bb decays is therefore crucial for constraining, under fairly general assumptions [12], the overall Higgs boson decay width and, in a global fit to all accessible combinations of Higgs boson production and decay modes, to allow for measurements of absolute Higgs boson couplings. An inclusive search for H \u2192 bb is not feasible at hadron colliders because of the overwhelming background from multijet production. In spite of a cross section more than an order of magnitude lower than the dominant gluon-fusion process, associated production of a Higgs boson with a vector boson, W or Z [13], offers a viable alternative because leptonic decays of the vector boson, W \u2192 \u03bd, Z \u2192 ( = e, \u00b5), and Z \u2192 \u03bd\u03bd, can be efficiently used for triggering and background reduction purposes [14,15]. The CDF and D0 experiments at the Tevatron reported an excess of events in their search for associated (W/Z)H production in the H \u2192 bb decay mode at a significance level of 2.8\u03c3 for m H = 125 GeV [16]. Recently, the CMS experiment reported an excess of events in the H \u2192 bb decay mode with a significance of 2.1\u03c3 for m H = 125 GeV [17].",

In addition to Z \u2192 \u03bd\u03bd decays, the 0-lepton channel has a smaller but not insignificant contribution from leptonic W decays when the lepton is produced outside of the detector acceptance or not identified. A b-tagging algorithm is used to identify the jets consistent with originating from an H \u2192 bb decay.

Systematic uncertainties on the signal and background modelling are implemented as deviations in their respective models in the form of \"nuisance\" parameters that are varied in the fit. Each nuisance parameter is constrained by a penalty term in the likelihood, associated with its uncertainty. Two versions of the analysis are presented in this paper: in the first, referred to as the dijet-mass analysis, the mass of the dijet system of b-tagged jets is the final discriminating variable used in the statistical analysis; in the other, a multivariate analysis (MVA) incorporating various kinematic variables in addition to the dijet mass, as well as b-tagging information, provides the final discriminating variable. Because the latter information is not available in similar detail for the 7 TeV dataset, the MVA is used only for the 8 TeV dataset. In both analyses, dedicated control samples, typically with loosened b-tagging requirements, constrain the contributions of the dominant background processes. The most significant background sources are (W/Z)+heavy-flavour-jet production and tt production. The normalisations of these backgrounds are fully determined by the likelihood fit. Other significant background sources are single-top-quark and diboson (W Z and ZZ) production, with normalisations taken from theory, as well as multijet events, normalised using multijet-enriched control samples. Since the MVA has higher expected sensitivity, it is chosen as the nominal analysis for the 8 TeV dataset to extract the final results. To validate the analysis procedures, both for the dijet-mass and MVA approaches, a measurement of the yield of (W/Z)Z production is performed in the same final states and with the same event selection, with H \u2192 bb replaced by Z \u2192 bb.",

The distance in (\u03b7,\u03c6) coordinates, \u2206R = (\u2206\u03c6) 2 + (\u2206\u03b7) 2 , is also used to define cone sizes. Transverse momentum and energy are defined as pT = p sin \u03b8 and ET = E sin \u03b8, respectively. For the purpose of object selections, \u03b7 is calculated relative to the geometric centre of the detector; otherwise, it is relative to the reconstructed primary vertex of each event.",

Events in the 1-lepton channel are primarily selected by single-lepton triggers. The E T threshold of the single-electron trigger was raised from 20 to 22 GeV during the 7 TeV data-taking period, and to 24 GeV for the 8 TeV data. The p T threshold of the single-muon trigger was similarly increased from 18 GeV for the 7 TeV data to 24 GeV at 8 TeV. As the single-lepton triggers for the 8 TeV data include isolation criteria, triggers with higher thresholds (60 GeV for electrons and 36 GeV for muons) but no isolation requirements are used in addition. Single-lepton trigger efficiencies are measured using a tag-and-probe method applied to Z \u2192 ee and Z \u2192 \u00b5\u00b5 events. In the 1-muon sub-channel, E miss T triggers are also used to compensate for the limited muon trigger-chamber coverage in some regions of the detector. Events in the 2-lepton channel are selected by a combination of single-lepton, dielectron and dimuon triggers. The thresholds of the dilepton triggers are 12 GeV for electrons and 13 GeV for muons.",

The AU2 tune [25,26] is used for the parton shower, hadronisation, and multiple parton interactions. The photos program [27] is used for QED final-state radiation. The powheg generator [28][29][30] is used within the MiNLO approach [31] with the CT10 PDFs [32], interfaced to pythia8 with the AU2 tune, as a cross-check and to evaluate systematic uncertainties on the signal acceptance and kinematic properties. It is also used for the generation of gluon-gluon-initiated ZH production at leading order (LO) in QCD, with results cross-checked by an independent computation [33]. (For the analysis of the 7 TeV data, the pythia8 generator is used for gg \u2192 ZH.) The transverse momentum distributions of the Higgs boson show substantial differences between the two ZH production processes. For qq-initiated W H and ZH production, the total production cross sections and associated uncertainties are computed at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in QCD [34][35][36], and with electroweak corrections at next-to-leading order (NLO) [37]. Additional normalisation-preserving differential electroweak NLO corrections are applied as a function of the transverse momentum of the vector boson [38]. For gluon-gluon-initiated ZH production, NLO corrections [39], which increase the total ZH production cross section by about 5%, are taken into account. The Higgs boson decay branching ratios are calculated with hdecay [11]. Signal samples are simulated for Higgs boson masses from 100 to 150 GeV in steps of 5 GeV. All charged-lepton flavours are simulated in the W and Z decays, as leptonic decays of the \u03c4 leptons can also be selected in the analysis. For the Higgs boson, only the bb decay mode is considered in the analysis.",

It is impractical to simulate a sufficiently large number of V l and V c events to provide a reliable description of these backgrounds in the analysis samples for which two b-tagged jets are required. An alternative procedure, parameterised tagging, is therefore used. Here, instead of directly tagging the c-and l-labelled jets with the MV1c algorithm, parameterisations as functions of p T and |\u03b7| of their probabilities to be b-tagged are used for the V l, V c and W W processes in all analysis samples in which two b-tagged jets are required. These parameterisations are, however, integrated over other variables that can affect the c-and light-jet tagging efficiencies. In particular, a strong dependence of these efficiencies is observed on \u2206R, the angular separation from the closest other jet, and a significant difference is seen between direct and parameterised tagging for V cc events with \u2206R < 1. No such difference is seen for V cl, V l and W W events. A dedicated correction, depending on \u2206R, is therefore applied to the V cc events.",

The free parameters of the transformation algorithm are optimised to maximise the expected signal sensitivity. For simplicity, these transformed outputs, which are used for the analysis, are called \"BDT V H discriminants\" in the following. An optimisation of the number of bins and bin boundaries is also performed for the m bb distribution used in the dijet-mass analysis in a similar way, where the free parameters of the transformation algorithm are optimised separately for the different analysis regions. The effect of the transformation on the BDToutput and dijet-mass distributions can be seen in figure 5 for the 1-lepton channel and one signal region. The transformation groups into few bins the m bb regions that are far from the signal on each of the low and high mass sides, while it expands the region close to the signal mass, where the signal-to-background ratio is largest. The effect on the BDT output is similar, but simpler to visualise because the signal and the background accumulate initially on the high and the low sides of the distribution, respectively. Correlations between input variables and the BDT V H discriminant can provide information on the impact of individual variables on the classification. Figure 6 shows such correlations for the dijet mass, which is the BDT input that provides the best single-variable discriminating power.  This section describes the modelling of individual backgrounds. In many cases, the data are able to constrain the normalisations and shapes better than the a priori estimates. A likelihood fit (also called \"global fit\") is used to simultaneously extract both the signal yield and constraints on the background normalisations and shapes. The distributions used by the fit are those of the dijet mass or BDT V H discriminant in the 2-tag signal regions, as appropriate, as well as those of the M V 1c value of the b-tagged jet in the 1-tag control regions.

For each signal or control region, an MJ-background template is obtained in an MJ-dominated region after subtracting the small remaining contribution from the other backgrounds. The other backgrounds are taken from a simulation improved by scale factors for the various contributions obtained from a preliminary global fit. The MJ-dominated region is obtained by modifying the nominal selection to use medium, instead of tight, leptons and loosening both the track and calorimeter-based isolation criteria. The track-based isolation is changed to the intervals 5%-12% and 7%-50% for electrons and muons respectively, instead of < 4%; and the calorimeter-based isolation is loosened to < 7% from < 4%. The sample sizes of the MJ-templates are however rather low in the 2-tag regions. Since it is observed that the kinematic properties of the 1-tag and 2-tag events in the MJ-dominated regions are similar, 1-tag events are used to enrich the 2-tag MJ templates. Events in the 1-tag category are promoted to the 2-tag category by assigning to the untagged jet an emulated M V 1c value drawn from the appropriate M V 1c distribution observed in the corresponding 2-tag MJ template. This distribution depends on the rank (leading or sub-leading) of the untagged jet and on the M V 1c value of the tagged jet. To cope with residual differences observed in some distributions between these pseudo-2-tag MJ events and the actual 2-tag MJ events, a reweighting is applied according to the M V 1c of the tagged jet and, for the electron sub-channel, according to \u2206R(jet 1 , jet 2 ) and p W",

The main purpose of including the p W T < 120 GeV intervals is to provide constraints on the largest backgrounds (V +jets and tt) in the global fit. Since the MJ background is twice as large for p W T < 120 GeV in the 1-electron subchannel than in the 1-muon sub-channel, only the 1-muon sub-channel is kept for p W T < 120 GeV so as to provide the most reliable constraints on the non-MJ backgrounds.

To cope with the reduced size of the 2-tag MJ event sample, a procedure similar to that used in the 1-lepton channel is used, wherein the pretag MJ sample is weighted by its 2-tag fraction and combinations of M V 1c values are randomly assigned to the jets according to their distribution in the 2-tag MJ template.

This test statistic is used for exclusion intervals derived with the CL s method [91,92].

The fitted\u03bc value is obtained by maximising the likelihood function with respect to all parameters.

These are obtained without any change to the dijet-mass analysis, except for the binning of the transformed m bb distribution, which is reoptimised. For the MVA, it is observed that the performance degrades for masses away from 125 GeV, for which the BDTs are trained. This is largely due to the fact that m bb is an input to the BDTs. The MVA results for other masses are therefore obtained using BDTs retrained for each of the masses tested at 5 GeV intervals between 100 and 150 GeV.

This applies to the tt, W bb, W cl, Zbb and Zcl processes. The corresponding factors applied to the nominal background normalisations as resulting from the global fit of the MVA to the 8 TeV data, are shown in table 7. As stated in section 8, the tt background is normalised in the 2-jet category independently in each of the lepton channels. The reason for uncorrelating the normalisations in the three lepton channels is that the regions of phase space probed in the 2-jet category are very different between the three channels. In the 2-lepton channel, the tt background is almost entirely due to events in which both top quarks decay into (W \u2192 \u03bd)b (fully leptonic decays) with all final-state objects detected (apart from the neutrinos). In the 1-lepton channel, it is in part due to fully leptonic decays with one of the leptons (often a \u03c4 lepton) undetected, and in part to cases where one of the top quarks decays as above and the other into (W \u2192 qq )b (semileptonic decays) with a missed light-quark jet. Finally, in the 0lepton channel, the main contributions are from fully leptonic decays with the two leptons undetected and from semileptonic decays with a missed lepton and a missed light-quark jet; here again, the missed leptons are often \u03c4 leptons. Futhermore, the p V T range probed is different in the 0-lepton channel:",

The number of nuisance parameters is even larger because care is taken to appropriately uncorrelate the impact of the same source of systematic uncertainty across background processes or across regions accessing very different parts of phase space. This avoids unduly propagating constraints. For instance, the tt background contributes quite differently in the 2-tag 3-jet regions of the 0-and 1-lepton channels on one side, and of the 2-lepton channel on the other. In the 0-and 1-lepton channels, it is likely that a jet from a t \u2192 b(W \u2192 qq) decay is missed, while in the 2-lepton channel it is likely that an ISR or FSR jet is selected.

The systematic uncertainties are encoded in templates of variations relative to the nominal template for each up-and-down (\u00b11\u03c3) variation. The limited size of the MC samples for some simulated background processes in some regions can cause large local fluctuations in templates of systematic variations. When the impact of a systematic variation translates into a reweighting of the nominal template, no statistical fluctuations are expected beyond those already present in the nominal template. This is the case, for instance, for the b-tagging uncertainties. For those, no specific action is taken. On the other hand, when a systematic variation may introduce changes in the events selected, as is the case for instance with the JES uncertainties, additional statistical fluctuations may be introduced, which affect the templates of systematic variations. In such cases, a smoothing procedure is applied to each systematic-variation template in each region. Bins are merged based on the constraints that the statistical uncertainty in each bin should be less than 5% and that the shapes of the systematic-variation templates remain physical: monotonous for a BDT V H discriminant, and with at most one local extremum for a dijet mass.",

To address this issue, systematic uncertainties that have a negligible impact on the final results are pruned away, region by region. A normalisation (shape) uncertainty is dropped if the associated template variation is below 0.5% (below 0.5% in all bins). Additional pruning criteria are applied to regions where the signal contribution is less than 2% of the total background and where the systematic variations impact the total background prediction by less than 0.5%. Furthermore, shape uncertainties are dropped if the up-and down-varied shapes are more similar to each other than to the nominal shape.

For each systematic uncertainty, the fit is performed again with the corresponding NP fixed to its fitted value,\u03b8, shifted up or down by its fitted uncertainty, with all the other parameters allowed to vary so as to take properly into account the correlations between systematic uncertainties. The magnitude of the shift in the fitted signal strength\u03bc is a measure of the observed impact of the considered NP. The same procedure is repeated, using the nominal values of the NP and of its associated uncertainty to provide its expected impact. To reduce the computation time and therefore to enable more detailed fit studies, some of the NPs which have a negligible effect on the expected fitted uncertainty on\u03bc are dropped: those associated with the muon momentum scale and resolution and with the electron energy resolution; one of those associated with the jet energy scale; and those associated with the quarkgluon composition of the backgrounds, which turn out to be fully correlated with those associated with the difference in energy response between quark and gluon jets. The ranking of the systematic uncertainties obtained with the MVA applied to the 8 TeV data is shown in figure 16 with the NPs ordered by decreasing post-fit impact on\u03bc. The five systematic uncertainties with the largest impact are, in descending order, those: on the dijet-mass shape for the W bb and W cc backgrounds for p W T > 120 GeV; on the W bl/W bb normalisation ratio for p W T > 120 GeV; on the W bb background normalisation; on the p W T shape in the 3-jet category for the W +hf background; and on the signal acceptance due to the parton-shower modelling.",

For the tt background, a single floating normalisation is determined by the global fit, instead of one in each of the 0-, 1-, and 2-lepton channels. In addition to the other floating normalisations mentioned for the 8 TeV data analysis, the MJ background normalisation is also left freely floating in all regions of the 1-lepton channel, except in the 2-tag 3-jet regions where the statistical power of the data is not sufficient to provide a reliable constraint. In these regions, an uncertainty of 30% is assigned to the MJ background normalisation, using a method similar to what is done for the analysis of the 8 TeV data.",

The final discriminants are the transformed m bb for the dijet-mass analysis and the BDT V H discriminants for the MVA. Results are extracted independently for the dijet-mass and multivariate analyses. Since the MVA has better expected sensitivity to a Higgs boson signal, it is used for the nominal results, while the dijet-mass analysis provides a cross-check (cf. section 11.2). For the 7 TeV data, however, only a dijet-mass analysis is performed. Unless otherwise specified, all results refer to a Higgs boson mass of 125 GeV.

(In the 100-120 GeV p V T interval, the likelihood ratio L designed to suppress the MJ background is used instead of min[\u2206\u03c6(E miss T , jet)].) For events with real E miss T , it is expected that the directions of the calorimeter-based and track-based missing transverse momenta, E miss T and p miss T , are similar. In events with fake E miss T arising from a jet energy fluctuation, it is expected that the direction of E miss T is close to the direction of the poorly measured jet. The signal region (A) is therefore selected with min[\u2206\u03c6(E miss T , jet)] > 1.5 and \u2206\u03c6(E miss T , p miss T ) < \u03c0/2.

The result for the Higgs boson signal strength is unchanged from the nominal result, and the statistical correlation between the two signal-strength parameters is found to be \u22123% in the MVA and 9% in the dijetmass analysis. The main reason for these low correlations is the different shape of the p V T distributions for V Z and for the Higgs boson signal, the p V T variable being used by both the MVA and the dijet-mass analysis. The yield tables in the appendix show that the ratio of the diboson contribution to that of the Higgs boson is indeed smaller in the higher p V T interval than in the lower one. The additional variables input to the BDT provide further separation in the MVA, leading to a very small diboson contribution in the most significant bins of the BDT V H discriminant, as can be seen in table 8.",
