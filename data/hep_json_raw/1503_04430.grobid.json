Instead, the control region is enlarged by removing the isolation criterion on one lepton, and the W \u00fe jets contribution is estimated using the lepton E \u0394R<0.2 T =E T distribution to fit the data with the MC predictions for other SM processes (dominant at low values of the isolation variable) and W \u00fe jets (dominant at large values).

The corresponding lower limits on the Z 0 mass are 2.5 TeV, 2.2 TeV, and 2.2 TeV for the e\u03bc, e\u03c4, and \u03bc\u03c4 channels, respectively. The observed lower mass limits are a factor of three to four higher than the best limits from the Tevatron [8][9][10][11] and 1.5 to 2 times better than the previous limits from ATLAS [12] for the same couplings. In summary, a search has been performed for a heavy particle decaying to e\u03bc, e\u03c4 had , or \u03bc\u03c4 had final states using 20.3 fb \u22121 of pp collision data at ffiffi ffi s p \u00bc 8 TeV recorded by the ATLAS detector at the LHC. The data are found to be consistent with SM predictions. Limits are placed on the cross section times branching ratio for an RPV SUS\u1ef8 \u03bd \u03c4 and a LFV Z 0 boson. These results considerably extend previous constraints from the Tevatron and LHC experiments.",
