The masses m b and m c of the beauty and charm quarks, as well as the transverse momentum of a jet, provide a hard scale, which is necessary for the calculation of pQCD predictions [1]. The dominant process for beauty and charm production at HERA is boson-gluon fusion (BGF): \u03b3 g \u2192 QQX, with Q = b, c. In the kinematic regime of photoproduction, where the photon virtuality Q 2 is small, two classes of processes contribute to BGF. In direct photon processes, the photon emitted from the electron 1 enters the hard BGF process directly. In resolved photon processes, the photon fluctuates into a hadronic state before the hard interaction and acts as a source of partons, one of which takes part in the hard interaction. At leading order (LO) pQCD resolved photon processes are expected to contribute significantly in the photoproduction region.",

The lifetime or mass of heavy flavoured hadrons [2][3][4][5][6][7], semileptonic decays [5,6,8] or the full reconstruction of a D or D * meson [9,10] are exploited to perform the measurements. In general, the measured cross sections agree reasonably well with the theoretical predictions. In the H1 measurement performed with HERA I data [5], where beauty photoproduction was investigated using two jets and a muon in the final state, the data were found to be described reasonably well by the pQCD calculations at next-to-leading order (NLO), except in the region of low transverse momentum of the muon 2.5 < P \u03bc T < 3.3 GeV and of low leading jet transverse momentum 7.0 < P jet1 T < 10.0 GeV, where the NLO prediction was lower than the data. Comparable measurements were performed by the ZEUS collaboration [6,7], covering a similar phase space. Here, a good description by the NLO QCD predictions is found, also at low transverse momenta of the leading jet and the muon.",

The analysis exploits the lifetime and the mass of heavy flavoured hadrons as in the former HERA I beauty production analysis [5]. The measurement is additionally performed for charm photoproduction. Increased statistics due to increased luminosity and extended phase space, a better understanding and description of the H1 vertex detector [11], which is crucial for this analysis, as well as reduced systematic uncertainties compared to the previous H1 analysis make a more detailed test of pQCD predictions possible. Going beyond the earlier HERA I analysis, the cross sections as a function of the azimuthal angular difference \u03c6 jj between the two leading jets, which are sensitive to higher order corrections, are also measured. Furthermore, cross sections are measured in two different regions of phase space, which are either enriched by resolved or direct photon processes.",

In the collinear approach transverse momenta obtained through initial state QCD evolution are neglected and all the transverse momenta are generated in the hard scattering process, i.e. the partons entering the hard interaction are collinear with the proton. Effects from non-zero transverse momenta of the gluons enter only at NLO. In the k t -factorisation ansatz the transverse momenta of gluons k t entering the hard interaction are already included at leading order both in the off-shell matrix element and the k t -dependent unintegrated gluon density [18].

The hadronisation process is simulated according to the Lund string model [21]. For the systematic uncertainty arising from the fragmentation model, additional samples are generated using the Peterson fragmentation function [22]   [26,27]. MC@NLO: The MC@NLO program for HERA [1] combines a collinear NLO calculation of heavy flavour production in the massive approach [28,29] with parton showers and hadronisation as described in [30,31]. The direct and resolved parts of the cross section are calculated separately. MC@NLO uses parton showers applying the DGLAP evolution to simulate higher order contributions and the cluster fragmentation [26,27] as implemented in HERWIG [25]. PYTHIA and CASCADE are used to simulate detector effects in order to determine the acceptance and the efficiency and to estimate the systematic uncertainties associated with the measurement. The generated events are passed through a detailed simulation of the detector response based on the GEANT simulation program [32] and are processed using the same reconstruction and analysis chain as is used for the data.",

The measured cross sections are proportional to the rate of events with a muon and a dijet system rather than the rate of muons or jets. The separation of b, c and light quark (uds) events is only briefly described here. The procedure closely follows  that described in [5]. The separation is performed using the properties of the muon track associated to the \u03bc-jet. The impact parameter \u03b4 of a muon track is the transverse distance of closest approach (DCA) of the muon track to the beam spot point, which is the position of the beam interaction region in x and y. The beam spot is derived from tracks with CST hits averaging over many events and is updated regularly to account for drifts during beam storage. Muon tracks with \u03b4 > 0.1 cm are rejected to suppress contributions from the decays of long-lived strange particles. If the angle \u03b1 between the azimuthal angle of the \u03bc-jet and the line joining the primary vertex to the point of muon closest approach is less than 90 \u2022 , the impact parameter is defined as positive.

Therefore, the fit of this variable can distinguish the three different quark contributions.

This description is achieved by a better understanding of the detector and an improved detector simulation with regard to signal heights, noise levels and dead strips in the CST [11], the inclusion of effects from alignment imperfections, and the description of the dead material in front of the CST and CJC. Therefore, a further smearing of measured track parameters in the simulation is not necessary, as it was done in the former H1 analysis using HERA I data [5].

Compared to the previous H1 beauty measurement [5], the analysis profits from a three times larger luminosity of the data sample, an extended phase space as well as improved understanding of the H1 vertex detector. The flavour composition of the event sample is determined by the transverse momentum of the muon relative to the jet axis of its associated jet P rel T and by its impact parameter \u03b4. Total visible and differential cross sections are measured, and the results are compared to leading order QCD models provided by PYTHIA, CASCADE, and HERWIG, as well as to the next-to-leading order calculations provided by MC@NLO. At low values of P \u03bc T and P jet1 T , the present beauty measurement does not show a significant excess as observed by the previous H1 measurement with respect to the NLO calculation. In general the predictions are in reasonable agreement with the beauty and charm measurements.",
