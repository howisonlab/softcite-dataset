A low-mass search, for resonances with masses between 0.6 and 1.6 TeV, is performed based on events with dijets reconstructed at the trigger level from calorimeter information. A high-mass search, for resonances with masses above 1.6 TeV, is performed using dijets reconstructed offline with a particle-flow algorithm. The dijet mass spectrum is well described by a smooth parameterization and no evidence for the production of new particles is observed. Upper limits at 95% confidence level are reported on the production cross section for narrow resonances with masses above 0.6 TeV. In the context of specific models, the limits exclude string resonances with masses below 7.7 TeV, scalar diquarks below 7.2 TeV, axigluons and colorons below 6.1 TeV, excited quarks below 6.0 TeV, color-octet scalars below 3.4 TeV, W bosons below 3.3 TeV, Z bosons below 2.7 TeV, Randall-Sundrum gravitons below 1.8 TeV and in the range 1.9 to 2.5 TeV, and dark matter mediators below 2.6 TeV. The limits on both vector and axial-vector mediators, in a simplified model of interactions between quarks and dark matter particles, are presented as functions of dark matter particle mass and coupling to quarks. Searches are also presented for broad resonances, including for the first time spin-1 resonances with intrinsic widths as large as 30% of the resonance mass. The broad resonance search improves and extends the exclusions of a dark matter mediator to larger values of its mass and coupling to quarks.",

            "text": "Models of physics that extend the standard model (SM) often require new particles that couple to quarks (q) and/or gluons (g) and decay to dijets. The natural width of resonances in the dijet mass (m jj ) spectrum increases with the coupling, and may vary from narrow to broad compared to the experimental resolution. For example, in a model in which dark matter (DM) particles couple to quarks through a DM mediator, the mediator can decay to either a pair of DM particles or a pair of jets and therefore can be observed as a dijet resonance [1,2] that is either narrow or broad, depending on the strength of the coupling. When the resonance is broad, its observed line-shape depends significantly on the resonance spin. Here we report a search for narrow dijet resonances and a complementary search for broad resonances that considers multiple values of the resonance spin and widths as large as 30% of the resonance mass. Both approaches are sensitive to resonances with intrinsic widths that are small compared to the experimental resolution, but the broad resonance search is also sensitive to resonances with larger intrinsic widths. We explore the implications for multiple specific models of dijet resonances and for a range of quark coupling strength for a DM mediator.",

Similar searches for narrow resonances have been published previously by the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations at \u221a s = 13 TeV [3][4][5][6][7], 8 TeV [8][9][10][11], and 7 TeV [12-18] using strategies reviewed in ref.

A search for broad resonances considering natural widths as large as 30% of the resonance mass, directly applicable to spin-2 resonances only, has been published once before by CMS at \u221a s = 8 TeV [9].

This search uses a dijet event sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 27 fb \u22121 , less than the full data sample, as discussed in section 2.3. The events are reconstructed, selected, and recorded in a compact form by the high-level trigger (HLT) [20] in a technique referred to as \"data scouting\" [21], which is conceptually similar to the strategy that is reported in ref. [22]. Data scouting was previously used for low-mass searches published by CMS at \u221a s = 13 TeV [5] and at 8 TeV [8], and is similar to a trigger-level search at 13 TeV recently published by ATLAS [3]. The second search is a high-mass search [4][5][6][7][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18] for resonances with masses above 1.6 TeV, based on dijet events that are reconstructed offline in the full data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36 fb \u22121 .

Particles are classified as muons, electrons, photons, and either charged or neutral hadrons. Jets are reconstructed either from particles identified by the PF algorithm, yielding \"PF-jets\", or from energy deposits in the calorimeters, yielding \"Calo-jets\". The PF-jets, reconstructed offline, are used for the high-mass search, while Calo-jets, reconstructed at the HLT, are used for the low-mass search. To reconstruct either type of jet, we use the anti-k T algorithm [39,40] with a distance parameter of 0.4, as implemented in the FastJet package [41]. For the high-mass search, at least one reconstructed vertex is required. The reconstructed vertex with the largest value of summed physics-object p 2 T is taken to be the primary pp interaction vertex. Here the physics objects are the jets made of tracks, clustered using the jet finding algorithm [40,41] with the tracks assigned to the vertex as inputs, and the associated missing transverse momentum, taken as the negative vector sum of the p T of those jets. For PF-jets, charged PF candidates not originating from the primary vertex are removed prior to the jet finding. For both PF-jets and Calo-jets, an event-by-event correction based on the jet area [42,43] is applied to the jet energy to remove the estimated contribution from additional collisions in the same or adjacent bunch crossings (pileup).",

To recover the lost efficiency we used single-jet triggers at the HLT that did not rely on the H T trigger at L1 but instead used an efficient single-jet trigger at L1. There were three such triggers at the HLT: the first requiring a PF-jet with p T > 500 GeV, a second requiring a Calo-jet with p T > 500 GeV, and a third requiring a PF-jet with an increased distance parameter of 0.8 and p T > 450 GeV. The trigger used for the high-mass search was the logical OR of these five triggers. We select events with m jj > 1.25 TeV, where the dijet mass is fully reconstructed offline using wide jets, defined later. For this selection, the combined L1 trigger and HLT was found to be fully efficient for the full 36 fb \u22121 sample, as shown in figure 1. Here the absolute trigger efficiency is measured using a sample acquired with an orthogonal trigger requiring muons with p T > 45 GeV at the HLT. The data scouting technique is used for the low-mass search. When an event passes a data scouting trigger, the Calo-jets reconstructed at the HLT are saved along with the event energy density and the missing transverse momentum reconstructed from the calorimeter. The energy density is defined for each event as the median calorimeter energy per unit area calculated in a grid of \u03b7 \u2212\u03c6 cells [43] covering the calorimeter acceptance. The shorter time required for the reconstruction of the calorimetric quantities and the reduced size of the data recorded for these events allow a reduced H T threshold compared to the high-mass search. For the low-mass search, Calo-jets with p T > 40 GeV are used to compute H T . The trigger threshold is H T > 250 GeV, and we select events with m jj > 0.49 TeV for which the trigger is fully efficient, as shown in figure 1. Here the trigger efficiency is measured using a prescaled sample acquired with a data scouting trigger which required only that the event passed the jet trigger at L1 with H T > 175 GeV. This L1 trigger is also fully JHEP08(2018)130 efficient for m jj > 0.49 TeV, measured using another prescaled sample acquired with an even looser trigger with effectively no requirements (zero-bias) at L1 and requiring at least one Calo-jet with p T > 40 GeV at the HLT. Unlike the high-mass search, there were no single-jet triggers at the HLT in data scouting that would allow for the recovery of the inefficiency in the L1 trigger in 9 fb \u22121 of data at the end of the run, so only the first 27 fb \u22121 of integrated luminosity was used for the low-mass search.",

All dijet mass bin edges and widths throughout this paper are the same as those used by previous dijet resonances searches performed by the CMS collaboration [5,6,8,9,11,12,15,17]. Figure 1 illustrates that the searches are fully efficient for the chosen dijet mass thresholds. For the purpose of our search, full efficiency requires the measured trigger inefficiency in a bin to be less than the fractional statistical uncertainty in the number of events in the same bin in the dijet mass spectrum. For example, the measured trigger efficiency in the bin between 1246 and 1313 GeV in figure 1 (right) is 99.95 \u00b1 0.02%, giving a trigger inefficiency of 0.05% in that bin, which is less than the statistical uncertainty of 0.08% arising from the 1.6 million events in that same bin of the dijet mass spectrum. This criterion for choosing the dijet mass thresholds, m jj > 1.25 TeV for the high mass search and m jj > 0.49 TeV for the low mass search, ensures that the search results are not biased by the trigger inefficiency.",

All jets, the PF-jets in the high-mass search and Calo-jets in the low-mass search, are required to have p T > 30 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.5. The two jets with largest p T are defined as the leading jets. Jet identification (ID) criteria are applied to remove spurious jets associated with calorimeter noise as well as those associated with muon and electron candidates that are either mis-reconstructed or isolated [44]. For all PF-jets, the jet ID requires that the neutral hadron and photon energies are less than 90% of the total jet energy. For PF-jets that satisfy |\u03b7| < 2.4, within the fiducial tracker coverage, the jet ID additionally requires that the jet has non-zero charged hadron energy, and muon and electron energies less than 80 and 90% of the total jet energy, respectively. The jet ID for Calo-jets requires that the jet be detected by both the electromagnetic and hadron calorimeters with the fraction of jet energy deposited within the electromagnetic calorimeter between 5 and 95% of the total jet energy. An event is rejected if either of the two leading jets fails the jet ID criteria.

The wide-jet algorithm, designed for dijet resonance event reconstruction, reduces the analysis sensitivity to gluon radiation from the final-state partons. The two leading jets are used as seeds and the four-vectors of all other jets, if within \u2206R = \u221a (\u2206\u03b7) 2 + (\u2206\u03c6) 2 < 1.1, are added to the nearest leading jet to obtain two wide jets, which then form the dijet system. The dijet mass is the magnitude of the momentum-energy 4-vector of the dijet system, which is the invariant mass of the two wide jets. The wide jet algorithm thereby collects hard gluon radiation, satisfying the jet requirement p T > 30 GeV and found nearby the leading two final state partons, in order to improve the dijet mass resolution. This is preferable to only increasing the distance parameter within the anti-k T algorithm to 1.1, which would include in the leading jets the unwanted soft energy from pile-up and initial state radiation. The wide jet algorithm is similar to first increasing the distance parameter and then applying jet trimming [45] to remove unwanted soft energy.",

            "text": "As the dominant background for this analysis is expected to be the QCD production of two or more jets, we begin by performing comparisons of the data to QCD background predictions for the dijet events. The predictions are based upon a sample of 56 million Monte Carlo events produced with the pythia 8.205 [46] program with the CUETP8M1 tune [47,48] and including a Geant4-based [49] simulation of the CMS detector. The QCD background predictions are normalized to the data by multiplying them by a factor of 0.87 for the high-mass search and by a factor of 0.96 for the low-mass search, so that for each search the prediction for the total number of events agrees with the number observed. In figure 3, we observe that the measured azimuthal separation of the two wide jets, \u2206\u03c6, displays the \"back-to-back\" distribution expected from QCD dijet production. The strong peak at \u2206\u03c6 = \u03c0, with very few events in the region \u2206\u03c6 \u223c 0, shows that the data sample is dominated by genuine parton-parton scattering, with negligible backgrounds from detector noise or other nonphysical sources that would produce events more isotropic in \u2206\u03c6. In figure 4, we observe that dijet |\u2206\u03b7| has a distribution dominated by the t-channel parton exchange as does the QCD production of two jets. Note that the production rate increases with increasing |\u2206\u03b7|, whereas s-channel signals from most models of dijet resonances would decrease with increasing |\u2206\u03b7|. In figure 5, we observe that the number of dijets produced falls steeply and smoothly as a function of dijet mass. The observed dijet mass distributions are very similar to the QCD prediction from pythia, which includes a leading order QCD -  Figure 3.

The contribution of the low mass tail to the line shape also depends on the parton content of the resonance. Resonances decaying to gluons, which emit more QCD radiation than quarks, are broader and have a more pronounced tail. For the high-mass resonances, there is also a significant contribution that depends both on the parton distribution functions and on the natural width of the Breit-Wigner distribution. The low-mass component of the Breit-Wigner distribution of the resonance is amplified by the rise of the parton distribution function at low fractional momentum, as discussed in section 7.3 of ref. [55]. These effects cause a large tail at low mass values. Interference between the signal and the background processes is model dependent and not considered in this analysis. In some cases interference can modify the effective signal shape appreciably [56]. The signal shapes in the quark-quark channel come from quark-antiquark (qq) resonances, which likely has a longer tail caused by parton distribution effects than that for diquark (qq) resonances, tending to make the quoted limits in the quark-quark channel conservative when applied to diquark signals.",

The bias in the extracted signal was found to be negligible. There is no evidence for a narrow resonance in the data. The p-values of the background fits are 0.47 for the high-mass search and 0.44 for the low-mass search, indicating that the background hypothesis is an adequate description of the data. Using the statistical methodology discussed in section 4.1, the local significance for qq, qg, and gg resonance signals was measured from 0.6 to 1.6 TeV in 50-GeV steps in the low-mass search, and from 1.6 to 8.1 TeV in 100-GeV steps in the high-mass search. The significance values obtained for qq resonances are shown in figure 9. The most significant excess of the data relative to the background fit comes from the two consecutive bins between 0.79 and 0.89 TeV. Fitting these data to qq, qg, and gg resonances with a mass of 0.85 TeV yields local significances of 1.2, 1.6, and 1.9 standard deviations, including systematic uncertainties, respectively.",

This uncertainty is propagated to the limits by shifting the dijet mass shape for signal by \u00b12%. The uncertainty in the jet energy resolution translates into an uncertainty of 10% in the resolution of the dijet mass [43], and is propagated to the limits by observing the effect of increasing and decreasing by 10% the reconstructed width of the dijet mass shape for signal. The uncertainty in the integrated luminosity is 2.5% [57], and is propagated to the normalization of the signal. Changes in the values of the parameters describing the background introduce a change in the signal yield, which is accounted for as a systematic uncertainty as discussed in the next paragraph.",

            "text": "The asymptotic approximation [58] of the modified frequentist CL s method [59,60] is utilized to set upper limits on signal cross sections, following the prescription described in ref. [61]. We use a multi-bin counting experiment likelihood, which is a product of Poisson distributions corresponding to different bins. We evaluate the likelihood independently at each value of the resonance pole mass from 0.6 to 1.6 TeV in 50-GeV steps in the low-mass search, and from 1.6 to 8.1 TeV in 100-GeV steps in the high-mass search. The contribution from each hypothetical resonance signal is evaluated in every bin of dijet mass greater than the minimum dijet mass requirement in the search and less than 150% of the resonance mass (e.g. the high mass tail of a 1 TeV resonance is truncated, removing any contribution above a dijet mass of 1.5 TeV, but the low mass tail is not truncated). The systematic uncertainties are implemented as nuisance parameters in the likelihood model, with Gaussian constraints for the jet energy scale and resolution, and log-normal constraints for the integrated luminosity. The systematic uncertainty in the background is automatically evaluated via profiling, effectively refitting for the optimal values of the background parameters for each value of resonance cross section. This allows the background parameters to float freely to their most likely value for every signal cross section value within the likelihood function. Since the observed data are effectively constraining the sum of signal and background, the most likely value of the background decreases as the signal cross section increases within the likelihood function. This statistical methodology therefore gives a smaller background for larger signals within the likelihood function than methodologies that hold the background parameters fixed within the likelihood. This leads to larger probabilities for larger signals and hence higher upper limits on the signal cross section. The extent to which the background uncertainty affects the limit depends significantly on the signal shape and the resonance mass, with the largest effect occurring for the gg resonances, because they are broader, and the smallest effect occurring for qq resonances. The effect increases as the resonance mass decreases, and is most severe at the lowest resonance masses within each search, where the sideband used to constrain the background, available at lower dijet mass, is smaller. The effect of the systematic uncertainties on the limit for qq resonances is shown in figure 10. For almost all resonance mass values, the background systematic uncertainty produces the majority of the effect on the limit shown here.",

The observed (points) and expected (dashed) ratio between the 95% CL limit on the cross section, including systematic uncertainties, and the limit including statistical uncertainties only for dijet resonances decaying to quark-quark in the low-mass search (left) and in the highmass search (right). Tables 1 and 2, and figures 11 and 12, show the model-independent observed upper limits at 95% CL on the product of the cross section (\u03c3), the branching fraction to dijets (B), and the acceptance (A) for narrow resonances, with the kinematic requirements |\u2206\u03b7| < 1.3 for the dijet system and |\u03b7| < 2.5 for each of the jets. The acceptance of the minimum dijet mass requirement in each search has been evaluated separately for qq, qg, and gg resonances, and has been taken into account by correcting the limits and therefore does not appear in the acceptance A. The resonance mass boundary of 1.6 TeV between the highand low-mass searches was chosen to maintain a reasonable acceptance for the minimum dijet mass requirement imposed by the high-mass search. For a 1.6 TeV dijet resonance, the acceptance of the 1.25 TeV dijet mass requirement is 57% for a gluon-gluon resonance, 76% for a quark-gluon resonance, and 85% for a quark-quark resonance. At this resonance mass, the expected limits we find on \u03c3BA for a quark-quark resonance are the same in the high and low mass search. Figure 11 also shows the expected limits on \u03c3BA and their bands of uncertainty. The difference in the limits for qq, qg, and gg resonances at the same resonance mass originates from the difference in their line shapes. For the RS graviton model, which decays to both qq and gg final states, the upper limits on the cross section are derived using a weighted average of the qq and gg resonance shapes, where the weights correspond to the relative branching fractions for the two final states.",

The observed 95% CL upper limits on the product of the cross section, branching fraction, and acceptance for dijet resonances decaying to quark-quark (upper left), quark-gluon (upper right), gluon-gluon (lower left), and for RS gravitons (lower right). The corresponding expected limits (dashed) and their variations at the 1 and 2 standard deviation levels (shaded bands) are also shown. Limits are compared to predicted cross sections for string resonances [23,24], excited quarks [26,27], axigluons [28], colorons [29], scalar diquarks [25], color-octet scalars [30], new gauge bosons W and Z with SM-like couplings [32], dark matter mediators for m DM = 1 GeV [34,35], and RS gravitons [33].",

[63]), where \u03b1 S is the strong coupling constant evaluated at a renormalization scale equal to the resonance mass. Similarly, for the axigluon/coloron models a correction factor is applied which varies between K = 1.08 at a resonance mass of 0.6 TeV and K = 1.33 at 8.1 TeV [64]. The branching fraction includes the direct decays of the resonance into the five light quarks and gluons only, excluding top quarks from the decay, although top quarks are included in the calculation of the resonance width. The signal acceptance evaluated at the parton level for the resonance decay to two partons can be written as A = A \u2206 A \u03b7 , where A \u2206 is the acceptance of requiring |\u2206\u03b7| < 1.3 alone, and A \u03b7 is the acceptance of also requiring |\u03b7| < 2.5. The acceptance A \u2206 is model dependent. In the case of isotropic decays, the dijet angular distribution as a function of tanh (|\u2206\u03b7|/2) is approximately constant, and A \u2206 \u2248 tanh(1.3/2) = 0.57, independent of resonance mass. The acceptance A \u03b7 is maximal for resonance masses above 1 TeV-greater than 0.99 for all models considered. The acceptance A \u03b7 decreases as the resonance mass decreases below 1 TeV, and for a resonance mass of 0.  Table 3.

In addition to the observed mass limits listed below, this analysis also excludes the RS graviton model within the mass interval between 1.9 and 2.5 TeV and the Z model within roughly a 50 GeV window around 3.1 TeV.",

Following the recommendation of the LHC DM working group [34,35], the exclusions are computed for Dirac DM and for a universal quark coupling g q = 0.25 and for a DM coupling of g DM = 1.0.

As a consequence and similar to narrow resonances, the broad resonances decaying to gg have a more pronounced tail at low mass, and hence the limits for these resonances are weaker than those for resonances decaying to qq.

For these quoted values, the limits on the resonance cross section are well understood, increasing monotonically as a function of resonance width at each value of resonance mass. To obtain this behavior in the limit, we find it is sufficient to require that the expected limit derived for a truncated shape agrees with that derived for the full shape within 15%. The truncated shape is cut off at a dijet mass equal to 70% of the nominal resonance mass, while the full shape is cut off at a dijet mass of 1.25 TeV. For both the truncated and the full limits, the cross section limit of the resonance signal is corrected for the acceptance of this requirement on the dijet mass in order to obtain limits on the total signal cross section. The difference between the expected limits using the full shape and the truncated shape is negligible for most resonance masses and widths, because the signal tail at low mass is insignificant compared to the steeply falling background. For some resonance masses beyond our maximum, the low dijet mass tail causes the limit to behave in an unphysical manner as a function of increasing width.  Figure 17. The resonance signal shapes (left) and observed 95% CL upper limits on the product of the cross section, branching fraction, and acceptance (right) for spin-2 resonances produced and decaying in the gluon-gluon channel are shown for various values of intrinsic width and resonance mass. The reconstructed dijet mass spectrum for these resonances is estimated from the pythia 8 MC event generator, followed by the simulation of the CMS detector response.  Figure 18.

For example, for a vector resonance, we find that the highest resonance mass that satisfies this condition is 5 TeV for a resonance with 30% width, 6 TeV for 20% width, 7 TeV for 10% width, and 8 TeV for a narrow resonance. It is useful to define the signal pseudo-significance distribution S/ \u221a B where S is the resonance signal and B is the QCD background. The signal pseudosignificance indicates sensitivity to the signal in the presence of background as a function of dijet mass, and has been used as an alternative method of evaluating the sensitivity of the search to the low mass tail. The maximum resonance mass values we present correspond to a 70% acceptance for the signal pseudo-significance, when the signal shape is truncated at 70% of the nominal resonance mass. This demonstrates that, for resonance masses and widths which satisfy our resonance mass condition, the signals are being constrained mainly by data in the dijet mass region near the resonance pole. Signal injection tests analogous to those already described for the narrow resonance search were repeated for the broad resonance search, and the bias in the extracted signal was again found to be negligible. As discussed in the previous CMS search for broad dijet resonances [9], our signal shapes consider only the s-channel process, which dominates the signal, and our results do not include the possible effects of the t-channel exchange of a new particle or the interference between the background and signal processes.",

For each mediator mass value, the predictions for the cross section for mediator production as a function of g q are converted to a function of the width, using eq. (6.4), and are then compared to our cross section limits from figure 18 to find the excluded values of g q as a function of mass for a spin-1 resonance shown in figure 19. Also shown in figure 19 is the limit on g q from the quark-quark narrow resonance shape we used in the previous sections to set narrow-resonance limits. These are equal to the limits on g q in figure 15 and are derived from the limits on g q in figure 13 using the formula  Figure 19. The 95% CL upper limits on the universal quark coupling g q as a function of resonance mass for a vector mediator of interactions between quarks and DM particles. The right vertical axis shows the natural width of the mediator divided by its mass. The observed limits taking into account the natural width of the resonance are in red(upper solid curve), expected limits (dashed) and their variation at the 1 and 2 standard deviation levels (shaded bands) are shown. The observed limits from the narrow resonance search are in blue (lower solid curve), but are only valid for the width values up to approximately 10% of the resonance mass. The exclusions are computed for a spin-1 mediator and, Dirac DM particle with a mass m DM = 1 GeV and a coupling g DM = 1.0. Equation (6.5) is applicable for a narrow mediator with g DM = 1 and mass much larger than the quark and DM particle masses. The quark-quark narrow-resonance limits are derived from a narrow spin-2 resonance shape, which is approximately the same as a spin-1 resonance shape for small values of g q , and therefore in figure 19 at small values of g q the narrow-resonance limits are roughly the same as the limits which take into account the width of the resonance. For resonance masses smaller than about 2.5 TeV, the acceptance of the dijet mass requirement m jj > 1.25 TeV is reduced by taking into account the resonance natural width, resulting in a small increase in the limits compared to the narrow-resonance limits, which can be seen in figure 19. At 3.7 TeV, the largest value of the resonance mass considered approximately valid for the narrow-resonance limits on g q , the narrow-resonance limit is g q > 0.42, while the more accurate limit taking into account the width for the spin-1 resonance is g q > 0.53. The limits taking into account the natural width can be calculated up to a resonance mass of 4.1 TeV for a width up to 30% of the resonance mass. The limits from the narrow resonance search are approximately valid up to coupling values of about 0.4, corresponding to a width of 10%, while the limits taking into account the natural width of the resonance probe up to a coupling value of 0.76, corresponding to a natural width of 30%. We conclude that these limits on a vector DM mediator, taking into account the natural width of the resonance, improve on the accuracy of the narrow-width limits and extend them to larger values of the resonance mass and coupling to quarks.",

A low-mass search, for resonances with masses between 0.6 and 1.6 TeV, is performed based on events with dijets reconstructed at the trigger level from calorimeter information. A high-mass search, for resonances with masses above 1.6 TeV, is performed using dijets reconstructed offline with a particle-flow algorithm. The dijet mass spectra are observed to be smoothly falling distributions. In the analyzed data samples, there is no evidence for resonant particle production. Generic upper limits are presented on the product of the cross section, the branching fraction to dijets, and the acceptance for narrow quark-quark, quark-gluon, and gluon-gluon resonances that are applicable to any model of narrow dijet resonance production. String resonances with masses below 7.7 TeV are excluded at 95% confidence level, as are scalar diquarks below 7.2 TeV, axigluons and colorons below 6.1 TeV, excited quarks below 6.0 TeV, color-octet scalars below 3.4 TeV, W bosons with the SM-like couplings below 3.3 TeV, Z bosons with the SM-like couplings below 2.7 TeV, Randall-Sundrum gravitons below 1.8 TeV and in the range 1.9 to 2.5 TeV, and dark matter mediators below 2.6 TeV. The limits on both vector and axial-vector mediators, in a simplified model of interactions between quarks and dark matter particles, are presented as functions of dark matter particle mass. Searches are also presented for broad resonances, including for the first time spin-1 resonances with intrinsic widths as large as 30% of the resonance mass. The broad resonance search improves and extends the exclusions of a dark matter mediator to larger values of its mass and coupling to quarks. The narrow and broad resonance searches extend limits previously reported by CMS in the dijet channel, resulting in the most stringent constraints on many of the models considered.",
