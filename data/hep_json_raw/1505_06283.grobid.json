The isospin violating decay J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c6\u03c0 0 f0(980) with f0(980) \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0, is observed for the first time. The width of the f0(980) obtained from the dipion mass spectrum is found to be much smaller than the world average value. In the \u03c0 0 f0(980) mass spectrum, there is evidence of f1(1285) production. By studying the decay J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c6\u03b7 \u2032 , the branching fractions of \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 and \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 , as well as their ratio, are also measured.

            "text": "The nature of the scalar meson f 0 (980) is a longstanding puzzle. It has been interpreted as a qq state, a KK molecule, a glueball, and a four-quark state (see the review in Ref. [1]). Further insights are expected from studies of f 0 (980) mixing with the a 0 0 (980) [2], evidence for which was found in a recent BESIII analysis of J/\u03c8 and \u03c7 c1 decays [3]. BESIII also observed a large isospin violation in J/\u03c8 radiatively decaying into \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 and \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 involving the intermediate decay \u03b7(1405) \u2192 \u03c0 0 f 0 (980) [4]. In this study, the f 0 (980) width was found to be 9.5 \u00b1 1.1 MeV/c 2 . One proposed explanation for this anomalously narrow width and the observed large isospin violation, which cannot be caused by a 0 0 (980) \u2212 f 0 (980) mixing, is the triangle singularity mechanism [5,6].",

The cylindrical core of the BESIII detector consists of a helium-based main drift chamber (MDC), a plastic scintillator time-of-flight system (TOF), and a CsI(Tl) electromagnetic calorimeter (EMC). All are enclosed in a superconducting solenoidal magnet providing a 1.0 T (0.9 T in 2012) magnetic field. The solenoid is supported by an octagonal flux-return yoke with resistive plate counter muon identifier modules interleaved with steel. The acceptance for charged tracks and photons is 93% of 4\u03c0 solid angle. The chargedparticle momentum resolution is 0.5% at 1 GeV/c, and the specific energy loss (dE/dx) resolution is better than 6%. The photon energy is measured in the EMC with a resolution of 2.5% (5%) at 1 GeV in the barrel (endcaps). The time resolution of the TOF is 80 ps (110 ps) in the barrel (endcaps). The BESIII offline software system framework, based on the Gaudi package [14], provides standard interfaces and utilities for event simulation, data processing and physics analysis.",

A variation in B(J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c6\u03b7 \u2032 ) will change the size of peaking background and thus the signal yield. In Eq. (2), it is reasonable to consider a change in the quantity N obs /B J/\u03c8 \u03c6\u03b7 \u2032 with any variation in B(J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c6\u03b7 \u2032 ). The fit to the data is repeated after varying the number of peaking background to correspond with 1\u03c3 variations in B(J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c6\u03b7 \u2032 ) [1]. The largest difference of N obs /B J/\u03c8 \u03c6\u03b7 \u2032 from the nominal result is taken as the systematic uncertainty.

            "text": "In summary, we have studied the decay J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c63\u03c0 \u2192 K + K \u2212 3\u03c0. The isospin violating decay J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c6\u03c0 0 f 0 is observed for the first time. In the \u03c0 0 f 0 mass spectrum, there is an evidence of the axial-vector meson f 1 , but not all \u03c0 0 f 0 pairs come from the decay of an f 1 . Using B(J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c6f 1 ) = (2.6 \u00b1 0.5) \u00d7 10 \u22124 and B(f 1 \u2192 \u03c0a 0 \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0\u03b7) = (36 \u00b1 7)% from the PDG [1], the ratio B(f 1 \u2192 \u03c0 0 f 0 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 )/B(f 1 \u2192 \u03c0 0 a 0 0 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 \u03b7) is determined to be (3.6\u00b11.4)% assuming isospin symmetry in the decay f 1 \u2192 a 0 \u03c0. This value is only about 1/5 of B(\u03b7(1405) \u2192 \u03c0 0 f 0 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 )/B(\u03b7(1405) \u2192 \u03c0 0 a 0 0 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 \u03b7) = (17.9 \u00b1 4.2)% [4]. On the other hand, the measured mass and width of the f 0 obtained from the invariant dipion mass spectrum are consistent with those in the decay J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7(1405) \u2192 \u03b3\u03c0 0 f 0 [4]. The measured f 0 width is much narrower than the world average value of 40\u2212100 MeV [1]. It seems that there is a contradiction in the isospin-violating decays f 1 /\u03b7(1405) \u2192 \u03c0 0 f 0 . However, a recent theoretical work [23], based on the triangle singularity mechanism as proposed in Ref. [5,6], analyzes the decay f 1 \u2192 \u03c0 0 f 0 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and predicts that the width of the peaking structure in the f 0 region is about 10 MeV. It also derives B(f 1 \u2192 \u03c0 0 f 0 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 )/B(f 1 \u2192 \u03c0 0 a 0 0 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 \u03b7) \u2243 1%, which is close to our measurement. This analysis supports the argument that the nature of the resonances a 0 0 and f 0 as dynamically generated makes the amount of isospin breaking strongly dependent on the physical process [23]. In addition, we have measured the branching fractions B(\u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 ) = (4.28 \u00b1 0.49(stat.)\u00b1 0.22(syst.)\u00b1 1.09)\u00d7 10 \u22123 and B(\u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 ) = (4.79 \u00b1 0.59(stat.) \u00b1 0.33(syst.) \u00b1 1.09) \u00d7 10 \u22123 , where the last uncertainty is due to B(J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c6\u03b7 \u2032 ). The ratio between them r 3\u03c0 = 1.12 \u00b1 0.19(stat.) \u00b1 0.06(syst.) is also measured for the first time. These results are consistent with those measured in the decay J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7 \u2032 [4].",
