The natural width of the particle is assumed to be much narrower than the experimental resolution, such that it is the latter that dominates the distribution of the dimuon invariant mass in signal events. To maximize the sensitivity to the presence of b-quarks, the analysis is performed in two data categories. The first search category requires at least one jet tagged as containing b-hadrons (b-tagged) in the final state. The second category requires exactly zero b-tagged jets in the event. Simultaneous fits to these two categories are used to search for both the gluon-gluon fusion and b-associated production mechanisms of the scalar particle. This work is primarily motivated as a signature-based search; the event selection is not designed to target any specific model and instead facilitates the comparison of the data with predictions from various theoretical models.",

Measurements of the properties of this particle [3][4][5][6][7] are so far consistent with expectations for the Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson [8][9][10][11][12][13]. However, the observed Higgs  boson could be only a part of an extended scalar sector, as predicted by several theoretical models beyond the SM. For example, such an extended scalar sector is predicted by a class of extensions of the SM known as the two-Higgs-doublet models (2HDM) [14,15].",

One of the higher-mass neutral Higgs bosons may couple to muons at a higher rate than to \u03c4 -leptons, in contradiction to the SM Yukawa ordering. This is the case in the Flavourful Higgs model [16], for example. The search described in this paper sets limits on the cross-section times branching ratio of \u03a6 decaying into muon pairs which are more stringent than the equivalent limits for \u03a6 decaying into \u03c4 -lepton pairs [17]. This is due to higher identification efficiency and lower background rate for muons than for \u03c4 -leptons, and the invariant-mass resolution being better for muon pairs than for \u03c4 -lepton pairs. Similarly, the coupling of these higher-mass neutral Higgs bosons to b-quarks could be enhanced relative to the SM Higgs boson coupling. Hence, the production of \u03a6 in association with b-quarks (bb\u03a6), shown in figure 1(a), could be more abundant than the production of \u03a6 by gluon-gluon fusion (ggF), shown in figure 1(b). The \u03a6 \u2192 bb decay mode, where \u03a6 is produced in associations with b-quarks, is investigated by CMS in ref. [18].",

In Sherpa, Z/\u03b3 * + jets matrix elements were evaluated with up to two extra partons at NLO, and three or four extra partons were included at LO in QCD. The merging of different parton multiplicities was achieved through a matching scheme based on the CKKW-L [47,48] merging technique using a merging scale of Q cut = 20 GeV. The models used for the parton shower and underlying event are the ones provided internally by Sherpa. The Sherpa 2.2.1 generator adopts a full five-flavour scheme, with massless b-quarks and c-quarks in the matrix elements. These quarks are given mass in the final state and massive quarks can be produced directly via the parton shower. The MadGraph5 aMC@NLO v2 generator merges the LO (QCD) matrix-element calculations for Z/\u03b3 * + jets with up to four additional partons (higher jet multiplicities are modelled by the parton shower algorithm). The merging scheme applied to combine different parton multiplicities is the CKKW-L scheme with a merging scale of Q cut = 30 GeV. For the LO matrix-element calculation the NNPDF2.3 LO PDFs were used (with \u03b1 S = 0.13). The A14 tune, together with the NNPDF2.3 LO PDFs, was used for the parton shower. Similarly to Sherpa 2.2.1, MadGraph5 aMC@NLO adopts a full five-flavour scheme.",

For the generation of tt events, the h damp parameter of Powheg-Box, which controls the transverse momentum of the first additional emission beyond the Born configuration, was set to the mass of the top quark.

These are found to have only a small impact (they account for < 0.4% of the total uncertainty on the fitted value of the signal cross-sections). Other sources of experimental uncertainties are the residual differences in the modelling of the flavour-tagging algorithm, the jet energy scale and the jet energy resolution after the simulation-to-data correction factors are applied. Flavour-tagging simulation-to-data efficiency correction factors are derived [68] separately for b-jets, c-jets, and light-flavour jets. All three correction factors depend on jet p T (or p T and |\u03b7|) and are affected by uncertainties from multiple sources. These are decomposed into uncorrelated components which are then treated independently, resulting in three uncertainties for b-jets and for c-jets, and five for light-flavour jets. The approximate size of the uncertainty in the tagging efficiency is 2% for b-jets, 10% for c-jets and 30% for light-flavour jets. Additional uncertainties are considered in the extrapolation of the b-jet efficiency calibration above p T = 300 GeV and in the misidentification of hadronically decaying \u03c4 -leptons as b-jets. The uncertainties in the jet energy scale and resolution are based on their respective measurements in data [66]. The many sources of uncertainty in the jet energy scale correction are decomposed into 21 uncorrelated components which are treated as being independent of one another.

Rather than a single nuisance parameter to describe the 28 eigenvectors of this PDF error set, which could lead to an underestimation of its effect, a re-diagonalized set of 7 PDF eigenvectors was used [34]. This represents the minimal set of PDF eigenvectors that maintains the necessary correlations, and the sum in quadrature of these eigenvectors matches the original CT14NNLO error envelope well. They are treated as separate nuisance parameters. The uncertainties due to the variation of PDF scales and \u03b1 S are derived using VRAP. The former is obtained by varying the renormalization and factorization scales of the nominal CT14NNLO PDF up and down simultaneously by a factor of two. The value of \u03b1 S used (0.118) is varied by \u00b10.002. The EW correction uncertainty was assessed by comparing the nominal additive (1 + \u03b4 EW + \u03b4 QCD ) treatment with the multiplicative approximation ((1 + \u03b4 EW )(1 + \u03b4 QCD )) treatment of the EW correction in the combination of the higher-order EW and QCD effects. The uncertainty in the photon-induced correction is calculated from the uncertainties in the quark masses and the photon PDF. Following the recommendations of the PDF4LHC forum [80], an additional uncertainty due to the choice of nominal PDF set is derived by comparing the central values of CT14NNLO with those from other PDF sets, namely MMHT14 [81] and NNPDF3.0 [82]. The maximum width of the envelope of these comparisons is used as the PDF choice uncertainty, but only if it is larger than the width of the CT14NNLO PDF eigenvector variation envelope.",

To estimate the impact of initial and final state radiation modelling, two alternative Powheg+Pythia samples were generated with the following parameters. In the first one, the renormalization (\u00b5 r ) and factorization (\u00b5 f ) scale were varied by a factor of 0.5, the value of h damp was doubled (2m t ) and the corresponding Perugia 2012 radiation tune variation was used. In the second sample, the renormalization and factorization scales were varied by a factor of 2, while the h damp parameter was not changed.

These choices of parameters have been shown to encompass the cases where \u00b5 r and \u00b5 f are varied independently, and covered the measured uncertainties of the data for unfolded tt distributions [83,84].

The search is conducted with 36.1 fb \u22121 of pp collision data at \u221a s = 13 TeV, recorded during 2015 and 2016. The observed dimuon invariant mass spectrum is consistent with the Standard Model prediction within uncertainties for events both with and without a b-tagged jet over the 0.2-1.0 TeV range. The observed upper limits at 95% confidence level on the cross-section times branching ratio for b-quark associated production and gluon-gluon fusion are between 1.9 and 41 fb and 1.6 and 44 fb respectively, which is consistent with expectations.",
