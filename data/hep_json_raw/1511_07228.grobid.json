A sensitivity study is performed to the process s \u00c0 ! cl \u00c0 based on a 3 fb \u00c01 inclusive Monte Carlo sample of e \u00fe e \u00c0 collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 4.26 or 4.6 GeV, in the framework of the BESIII software system. The 90 % confidence level upper limits on B\u00f0s \u00c0 ! cl \u00c0 \u00de are estimated assuming no signal is produced. We also obtain the sensitivity on B\u00f0s \u00c0 ! cl \u00c0 \u00de as a function of the integrated luminosity, to serve as a reference for the HIEPA being proposed in China. It is found that 6.34 ab \u00c01 are needed to reach the current best upper limit of 4:4 \u00c2 10 \u00c08 and about 2510 ab \u00c01 are needed to reach a sensitivity of 10 \u00c09 if the detector design is similar to that of BESIII.",

On the other hand, the rates of LFV may be enhanced to observable level in various new physics scenarios beyond the SM, such as the Minimal Supersymmetric extension of the SM (MSSM) [3], Grand Unified Theories [4], and seesaw mechanisms [5].",

We can see that the background of e \u00fe e \u00c0 ! c ISR s \u00fe s \u00c0 , where the ISR photon is misidentified as arising from s decays, can be removed easily by accepting as signal candidates only those photons whose energy lies above a certain threshold at 4.0 and 4.26 GeV without efficiency loss.
