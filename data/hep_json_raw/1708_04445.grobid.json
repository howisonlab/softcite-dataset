The diboson system is reconstructed using pairs of large-radius jets with high transverse momentum and tagged as compatible with the hadronic decay of high-momentum W or Z bosons, using jet mass and substructure properties. The search is sensitive to diboson resonances with masses in the range 1.2-5.0 TeV. No significant excess is observed in any signal region. Exclusion limits are set at the 95% confidence level on the production cross section times branching ratio to dibosons for a range of theories beyond the Standard Model. Model-dependent lower limits on the mass of new gauge bosons are set, with the highest limit set at 3.5 TeV in the context of mass-degenerate resonances that couple predominantly to bosons.",

One possible signature of such new phenomena is the production of a heavy resonance with the subsequent decay into a final state consist ing of a pair of vector bosons (WW, WZ, ZZ). Many models of physics beyond the Standard Model (SM) predict such a signa ture. These include extensions to the SM scalar sector as in the two-Higgs-doublet model (2HDM) [1] that predict new spin-0 res onances, composite-Higgs models [2][3][4] and models motivated by Grand Unified Theories [5][6][7] that predict new W' spin-1 reso nances, and warped extra dimensions Randall-Sundrum (RS) mod els [8][9][10] that predict spin-2 Kaluza-Klein (KK) excitations of the graviton, GKK. The heavy vector triplet (HVT) [11,12] phenomeno logical Lagrangian approach provides a more model-independent framework for interpretation of spin-1 diboson resonances.",

            "text": "The search presented here focuses on TeV-scale resonances that decay into pairs of high-momentum vector bosons which, in turn, decay hadronically. The decay products of each of those vector bosons are collimated due to the high Lorentz boost and are typ ically contained in a single jet with radius R = 1.0. While the use of hadronic decays of the vector bosons benefits from the largest branching ratio (67% for W and 70% for Z bosons) amongst the possible final states, it suffers from a large background contami nation from the production of multijet events. However, this con tamination can be mitigated with jet substructure techniques that exploit the two-body nature of V qq decays (with V = W or Z). Previous searches for diboson resonances were carried out by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations with pp collisions at = 7, 8 and 13 TeV. These include fully leptonic (\u00a3v\u00a3v, \u00a3v\u00a3\u00a3) [13][14][15][16], semileptonic (vvqq, \u00a3vqq, \u00a3\u00a3qq)  [17][18][19] and fully hadronic (qqqq) VV [17,19] final states. By combining the results of searches in the vvqq, \u00a3vqq, \u00a3\u00a3qq and qqqq channels, the ATLAS Collaboration [17] set a lower bound of 2.60 TeV on the mass of a spin-1 resonance at the 95% confidence level, in the context of the HVT model B with gV = 3 (described in Section 2). When interpreted in the context of the bulk RS model with a spin-2 KK graviton and k/M Pl = 1, this lower mass bound is 1.10 TeV. The results presented here benefit from an integrated luminosity of 36.7 fb-1, which is an order of magnitude larger than was available for the previous search in the fully hadronic final state at /s = 13 TeV [17].",

The new triplet field interacts with the Higgs field and thus with the longitudinally polarised W and Z bosons by virtue of the equivalence theorem [20][21][22]. The strength of the coupling to the Higgs field, and thus SM gauge bosons, is controlled by the parameter combination gVcH, where cH is a multiplicative constant used to parameterise potential devi ations from the typical strength of triplet interactions to SM vector bosons, taken to be gV. Coupling of the triplet field to SM fermions is set by the expression g2cF/gV, where g is the SM SU(2)L gauge coupling and, like for the coupling to the Higgs field, cF is a mul tiplicative factor that modifies the typical coupling of the triplet field to fermions.

The calculated production cross section times branching ratio ( The HVT model B with gV = 3 and cH -cF -1 [11] is used as another benchmark. This model describes scenarios in which strong dynamics give rise to the SM Higgs boson and naturally in clude a new heavy vector triplet field with electroweak quantum numbers. The constants cH and cF are approximately unity, and couplings to fermions are suppressed, giving rise to larger branch ing ratios (~ 50%) for either W' WZ or Z' WW decays than in model A. Resonance widths and experimental signatures are similar to those obtained for model A and the predicted a x B values for W' WZ with hadronic W and Z decays are 13 and 1.3 fb for W' masses of 2 and 3 TeV, respectively. Corresponding values for Z' WW are 6.0 and 0.55 fb. The RS model with one warped extra dimension predicts the existence of spin-2 Kaluza-Klein excitations of the graviton, with the lowest mode being considered in this search. While the origi nal RS model [8] (often referred to as RS1) is constructed with all SM fields confined to a four-dimensional brane (the \"TeV brane\"), the bulk RS model [8,9] employed here allows those fields to prop agate in the extra-dimensional bulk between the TeV brane and the Planck brane. Although ruled out by precision electroweak and flavour measurements, the RS1 model is used as a benchmark model to interpret diphoton and dilepton resonance searches due to the sizeable G KK couplings to light fermions in that model. In the bulk RS model, those couplings are suppressed and decays into final states involving heavy fermions, gauge bosons or Higgs bosons are favoured. The strength of the coupling depends on k/MP[, where k corresponds to the curvature of the warped extra dimension, and the effective four-dimensional Planck scale M Pl = 2.4 x 1018 GeV.

The inner detector covers the pseudorapidity range |nl < 2.5. It consists of silicon pixel, silicon microstrip, and transition radiation tracking detectors. A new innermost pixel layer [26] inserted at a radius of 3.3 cm has been used since 2015. Lead/liquid-argon (LAr) sampling calorimeters provide electromagnetic (EM) energy measurements with high granularity. A hadronic (steel/scintillator-tile) calorimeter covers the central pseudorapidity range (|nl < 1.7). The end-cap and forward regions are instrumented with LAr calorimeters for both the EM and hadronic energy measurements up to |nl = 4.9. The muon spectrometer surrounds the calorimeters and features three large air-core toroidal superconducting magnet systems with eight coils each. The field integral of the toroids ranges between 2.0 and 6.0 Tm across most of the detector. The muon spectrom eter includes a system of precision tracking chambers and fast detectors for triggering. A two-level trigger system [27] is used to select events. The first-level trigger is implemented in hard ware and uses a subset of the detector information to reduce the accepted rate to at most 100 kHz. This is followed by a software based trigger level that reduces the accepted event rate to 1 kHz on average.",

Muon identification relies on matching tracks in the inner detector to muon spectrometer tracks or track segments. Muon candidates must also satisfy the \"medium\" selec tion criterion [47] and the \"loose\" track isolation [47].",

Ghost association [54] is performed to associate tracks to the jets before the trimming procedure is applied. In this method, tracks are added with an infinitesimally small momentum as addi tional constituents in the jet reconstruction. Tracks associated with the jets are required to have pT > 0.4 GeV and satisfy a number of quality criteria based on the number of measurements in the sili con pixel and microstrip detectors; tracks must also be consistent with originating from the primary vertex [53]. Including informa tion from the tracking system provides improved mass resolution, especially at high jet pT, due to the relatively coarse angular reso lution of the calorimeter. The magnitude of the event's missing transverse momentum (ET mlss) is computed from the vectorial sum of calibrated elec trons, muons, and jets in the event [55]. For this computation and the rejection of non-collision background discussed below, jets are reconstructed from topological clusters using the anti-kt algo rithm with a radius parameter R = 0.4 and are required to satisfy pT > 20 GeV and |nl < 4.9. Calibration of those jets is described in Ref. [56]. The E\u2122ss value is corrected using tracks associated with the primary vertex but not associated with electrons, muons or jets.",

The rapidity separation between the leading and subleading jets (identified with subscripts 1 and 2  in the following) must be sufficiently small, |Ay| = |y1 -y2\\ < 1.2, which is particularly aimed at suppressing f-channel dijet pro duction. The pT asymmetry between the two jets A = (pT1 -pT2) I (pT1 + pT2) must be smaller than 0.15 to remove events where one jet is poorly reconstructed. Jets must be consistent with originating from hadronic decays of W or Z bosons. Discrimination against background jets inside a mass window including the WIZ mass is based on the variable D2, which is defined as a ratio of two-point to three-point en ergy correlation functions that are based on the energies of and pairwise angular distances between the jet's constituents [58,59]. This variable is optimised with parameter p = 1 to distinguish be tween jets originating from a single parton and those coming from the two-body decay of a heavy particle. A detailed description of the optimisation can be found in Refs. [52,60]. The boson-tagging criteria-the jet-mass window size and maximum D2 value-are simultaneously optimised to achieve the maximal background-jet rejection for a fixed W or Z signal-jet efficiency of 50%. The opti misation uses signal jets from simulated W' WZ qqqq events and background jets from simulated multijet events, and depends on the jet pT to account for varying resolution as a function of jet pT. The size of the W (Z) mass window varies from 22 (28) GeV near pT = 600 GeV to 40 (40) GeV at pT > 2500 GeV and the max imum D2 value varies from 1.0 to 2.0 as the jet pT increases. An event is tagged as a candidate WW (ZZ) event if both jets are within the W (Z) mass window. It can also be tagged as a can didate WZ event if the lower-and higher-mass jets are within the W and Z mass windows, respectively. Because the mass win dows are relatively wide and overlap, jets may pass both Wand Z-tagging requirements.",

The relative normalisation in each ntrk bin is controlled by a function which has a scaling parameter, al lowing a variation in the track efficiency. The relative W and Z boson event contributions are fixed to the prediction from the sim ulation but the total W + Z event normalisation is determined in the fit.

The search takes advantage of the high branching ratio of hadronic decays of the vector bosons and covers the resonance mass range between 1.2 and 5.0 TeV. In this kinematic range, the vector bosons are highly boosted and are reconstructed as single large-radius jets that are tagged by exploiting their two-body sub structure. The invariant mass distribution of the two highest-pT large-radius jets in each event is used to search for narrow res onance peaks over a smoothly falling background. No significant excess of data is observed and limits are set on the cross section times branching ratio for diboson resonances at the 95% confidence level. In the case of the phenomenological HVT model A (model B) with gV = 1 (gV = 3), a spin-1 vector triplet is excluded for masses between 1.2 and 3.1 TeV (1.2 and 3.5 TeV). For the bulk RS model with k/M Pl = 1, a spin-2 Kaluza-Klein graviton is excluded in the range between 1.3 and 1.6 TeV. Upper limits on the production cross section times branching ratio for new heavy scalar particles are set with values of 9.7 fb and 3.5 fb at scalar masses of 2 TeV and 3 TeV, respectively.
