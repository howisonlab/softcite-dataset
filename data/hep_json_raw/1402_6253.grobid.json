Despite the many successes of this theory in the last few decades, it has several limitations from the experimental and theoretical perspectives. For instance, the quadratically divergent loop corrections to the Higgs mass would imply a high level of fine-tuning. In addition, the SM in its current formulation cannot explain the abundance of dark matter in the universe and does not provide unification of forces at a high energy scale.",
