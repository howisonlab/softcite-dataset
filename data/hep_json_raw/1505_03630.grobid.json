            "text": "Light-by-light scatterings contain rich information on photon coupling to virtual and real particle states. In the context of quantum electrodynamics (QED), photons can couple to a virtual e + e \u2212 pair. Photons may also couple to known resonance states in the context of quantum chromodyanmics and electroweak dynamics in higher energy domains and possibly couple to unknown resonance states beyond the standard model. The perturbative QED calculations manifestly predict a maximized cross section at the MeV scale; however, no example of exact real-photonreal-photon scattering has yet been observed. Hence, we propose direct measurement with the maximized cross section at the center-of-mass system energy of 1-2 MeV to establish a firm footing at the MeV scale. Given current state of the art high power lasers, helicity-dependent elastic scattering may be observed at a reasonable rate, if a photon-photon collider exploiting \u03b3 -rays generated by the inverse nonlinear Compton process with electrons delivered from laserplasma accelerators (LPA) are properly designed. We show that such verification is feasible in a table-top scale collider, which may be an unprecedented breakthrough in particle accelerators for basic physics research in contrast to energy frontier colliders.",

            "text": "Light-by-light scattering is a purely quantum process, hence, in the standard model, only possible in the context of quantum electrodynamics (QED). QED is the most strictly tested dynamics in its perturbative regime. The scattering amplitude in the lowest order is described by the box diagram where a virtual e + e \u2212 pair loops between four external photons. So far the diagram is indirectly confirmed with off-shell external photons via \u03b3 A \u2192 \u03b3 A [1] known as Delbr\u00fcck scattering [2] and also proposed to be further tested via A A \u2192 A A\u03b3 \u03b3 in the higher energy domain at the Large Hadron Collider [3]. In these scatterings, however, photons are emitted from nuclei A and have finite offshell masses. With the exact on-shell condition, real-photon-real-photon scattering has not been demonstrated hitherto despite explicit predictions [4][5][6][7][8]. Moreover, its dependence on the photon polarization states has not been tested at all. By means of off-shell incident photons from nuclei, it is difficult to test the polarization property. Photon-photon interactions also contain rich information on the two-photon coupling to standard model/non-standard model resonance states depending on the center of mass energy. In the MeV range, no direct search for resonance states coupling to two photons has been performed. Therefore, it is indispensable to first verify the purely QED-based scattering PTEP 2016, 013C01 K. Homma et al. amplitude with specified polarization states in pristine experimental conditions, because a significant deviation from the prediction indicates the existence of physics beyond the standard model.",

There are several proposals [22][23][24][25] to probe photon-photon interactions in the context of the low energy limit of the QED interactions [26,27] based on only optical photons. These proposals commonly suffer from its extremely weak interaction. Therefore, current state of the art high power lasers are supposed to be indispensable. However, if such lasers are available, we may also use them to generate \u03b3 -rays.

We then consider measuring the elastic scattering without specifying the helicity states of the final state \u03b3 -rays. In contrast to the helicity dependence emphasis on the forward scattering amplitude [28,29], we rather aim at larger angle scattering events in order to verify the purely perturbative prediction.

            "text": "The elastic scattering of photons by photons has been thoroughly evaluated in [6][7][8]. The differential cross section per solid angle for unpolarized photon-photon scattering in the lower energy limit is approximated as 2 , where m is electron mass in units of = c = 1, k is the incident photon energy in the center-of-mass system, \u03b1 = 1/137 is the dimensionless fine structure constant, r 0 = \u03b1/m \u223c 2.8 \u00d7 10 \u221213 cm is the classical electron radius, and \u03d1 is the polar angle of scattered photons with respect to the colliding axis between two incident photons in the center-of-mass system on the reaction plane. For laser photons of k \u223c 1 eV, the total cross section is \u03c3 \u223c 10 \u221242 b. This is extremely small due to the steep k 6 dependence. This situation is shown in Fig. 2, where the differential cross section of the unpolarized photon-photon elastic scattering, d\u03c3 qed /d at \u03d1 = \u03c0/2, is plotted as a function of the center-of-mass system energy of photon-photon collisions, E cms . The cross section curve is obtained from the numerical calculation applying formulae in Ref. [8]. On the other hand, if k = 0.5-1.0 MeV is realized, the total cross section is maximized  up to \u03c3 \u223c 1 \u00b5b. Therefore, in order to detect the perturbative QED cross section, it is reasonable to perform the scattering experiment tuned at that energy range. In the region E cms = 1-2 MeV, we see a flat-top character. This allows relatively large fluctuations on E cms , which is preferable for the photon-photon collider exploiting \u03b3 -rays via laser Compton scattering off electrons from LPA having a percent-level energy spread. Figure 3 shows the helicity-dependent QED-based differential cross section d\u03c3 \u00b1\u2192any /d\u03b8 compared to the unpolarized cross section where the symbols \u00b1 \u2192 any indicate the same and opposite helicity states between two incident \u03b3 -rays going to all the possible helicity states. These predictions are the results of numerical calculations at E cms = 1.4 MeV based on Ref. [8]. We find a larger cross section in the same helicity incidence case, particularly around \u03d1 \u223c \u03c0/2. Figure 4(a) shows a table-top (3.4 m \u00d7 1.3 m) \u03b3 \u03b3 collider with a realistic detector system to capture large-angle \u03b3 \u03b3 \u2192 \u03b3 \u03b3 scattering events. The system consists of two LPAs to generate electron beams with which two incident \u03b3 -beams are further produced via the inverse Compton process in head-on collisions. Two initially synchronized laser pulses are incident from the top and bottom sides of the top view, respectively. They are individually split into two drive pulses for the LPA and scatter pulses for the successive inverse Compton process with electrons delivered from the LPA. Figure 4(b) illustrates the collision geometry around the interaction point (IP) of \u03b3 \u03b3 scattering, which is located at distance D from the inverse Compton scattering point (CP).",

It is worth noting that once we fix the focusing geometry, we cannot increase the effective number of \u03b3 -rays as much as we like even if we could increase the laser pulse energy. This is because of the nonlinear nature of Compton scattering represented by the parameter \u03b7 \u2261 e \u2212 A \u03bc A \u03bc /mc 2 , where A \u03bc is the four-vector potential of the laser pulse [38]. The \u03b7 parameter increases the effective electron mass m * = m 1 + \u03b7 2 in the laser field. Hence, the scattered photon energy in the single photon absorption case is effectively lowered and the photon yield in the Compton edge energy also diminishes. On the other hand, the larger number of laser photons increases the luminosity factor in the Compton scattering. Therefore, there is an 4/9 PTEP 2016, 013C01 K. Homma et al.

This contaminated event rate corresponds to 36% of that of the QED \u03b3 \u03b3 scattering. Therefore, even if one throws such contaminated events away without detailed event-by-event offline analysis, the statistical loss of QED events is still acceptable. In reality, the energy deposits on the detector as well as the event topologies, whether electromagnetic showers exist or not, are very different between QED \u03b3 \u03b3 scattering and M\u00f8ller's scattering, as displayed in Fig. 7(a) and (b). Therefore, one can readily distinguish two types of scattering events at the offline analysis and possibly distinguish them even within the same shot, if the two \u03b3 clusters are sufficiently isolated from the background electromagnetic 6/9 PTEP 2016, 013C01 K. Homma et al. showers. Moreover, counting the number of M\u00f8ller's scattering events is indispensable to directly measure the electron-electron luminosity in the actual experimental condition. This information is essential to deduce the \u03b3 \u03b3 luminosity in addition to the direct measurement of the \u03b3 -ray flux.",
