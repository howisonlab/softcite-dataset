The recent Tevatron combination perfomed by CDF and D0 Collaborations improved the relative incertainty to 0.37% [4]. All mass measurements in these combinations were done analyzing events where the top quarks are produced in pairs (tt). The top quark decays almost exclusively into a W boson and a b quark [5] and, depending on the decay modes of the two resulting W bosons, top quark-pair events yield final states with either 0, 1, or 2 charged leptons. To improve the overall precision, the top-quark mass should be measured independently in all decay channels. In the present analysis, we consider the events in the dilepton final state, which is defined by the presence of two oppositely charged leptons (electrons or muons), two or more jets, and a large imbalance in the total transverse momentum from the two neutrinos associated with the charged leptons (\"tt dilepton events\" or \"dilepton channel\").",

            "text": "At the Tevatron, the most accurate M top measurements in the dilepton channel [6,7] use methods of full or partial reconstruction of the top-quark events. In these analyses, the systematic uncertainty dominates over the statistical one with a large contribution of the jet-energy scale (JES) uncertainty. Measurements in the other final states reduce the JES systematic uncertainty by constraining the mass of the final-state jet pair to match the W -boson mass. This constraint permits a precise calibration of the calorimeter JES [8][9][10]. Since dilepton tt events do not contain jets from W decays, we devise a new method to reduce the impact of the JES uncertainty on the measurement result. In the past, CDF developed two methods to reconstruct the top-quark mass using only quantities with minimal dependence on the JES. One measurement exploited the transverse decay length of b-tagged jets [11] and another the transverse momentum of electrons and muons from W -boson decays to determine the top-quark mass [11,12]. These methods decreased the systematic uncertainty stemming from the JES uncertainty, but suffered from an increase of the statistical uncertainty due to their low sensitivity to the top-quark mass. In the current analysis, we combine two reconstruction methods, one with a strong dependence and one with a minimal dependence on JES. The combined method simultaneously optimizes the effect of the statistical and systematic uncertainties delivering a result with a minimal total uncertainty. This paper reports on the final CDF M top measurement in the dilepton channel performed with protonantiproton collision data at \u221a s = 1.96 TeV, collected at the Tevatron with the CDF II detector [13]. The measurement uses the full CDF Run II data set accumulated between March 2002 and September 2011 and corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 9.1 fb \u22121 . The results supersede those of Ref. [6] by exploiting an improved analysis technique and an additional integrated luminosity of about 3 fb \u22121 .",

The tracking system is immersed in the 1.4 T magnetic field of a solenoid aligned with the beams.

            "text": "For the selection of events we require the presence of two oppositely charged leptons (\u2113), with E T > 20 GeV for electrons or p T > 20 GeV/c for muons, at least one of which must be isolated [16] and detected in the central region of the detector (|\u03b7| < 1.1). We further require large missing transverse energy [17], E T > 25 GeV, and at least two jets with E T > 15 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.5. To detect jets we look for clusters of energy in the calorimeter using a cone algorithm with radius R = (\u2206\u03b7) 2 + (\u2206\u03c6) 2 = 0.4 [18], where \u03c6 denotes the azimuthal angle. Jet energies are corrected for instrumental effects [19]. In events in which E T originates from mismeasurements of the leptons or jets, the azimuthal angle between the E T vector and the direction of the mismeasured object is typically small. To suppress this instrumental background, we increase the E T requirement to E T > 50 GeV for events where \u2206\u03c6 between the directions of E T and at least one of the reconstructed leptons or jets is less than 20 \u2022 . One of the main backgrounds is due to events in which a Z boson is produced in association with jets and decays to an electron or muon pair (Z \u2192 ee, \u00b5\u00b5 + jets). These events may feature large E T due to a mismeasurement of the leptons or jets. Therefore, a supplementary requirement is applied to e + e \u2212 and \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 events when the dilepton mass is within 15 GeV/c 2 of the known Z-boson mass [5]. For these events, we require a E T significance [20] in excess of 4 GeV 1/2 . Since the products of tt decays have large transverse energies, further background suppression is achieved by requiring H T > 200 GeV [21]. Another large source of background is due to events in which a W boson produced in association with jets (W +jets) yields a single lepton in the final state, where one of the jets is misidentified as a second lepton (\"W +jets fakes\"). We find that approximately half of these events feature a small distance in the \u03b7-\u03c6 space between the fake lepton and the axis of one of the jets (j), \u2206R \u2113j = (\u2206\u03b7 \u2113j ) 2 + (\u2206\u03c6 \u2113j ) 2 . To reject this background we require \u2206R \u2113j to be greater than 0.2 for all possible pairings between leptons and jets in the event.",

Following the scan, we assign \u03c7 2dependent weights to the solutions in order to identify a preferred M reco t for each event.

We estimate these effects by calculating the average deviations between the results of PE's performed with default and modified templates. The modified templates are derived by using event samples generated with variations of the relevant parameters within their uncertainties. We estimate the modeling uncertainty that stems from the difference between leading-order (LO) and next-toleading-order (NLO) quantum chromodynamics (QCD) calculations by comparing MC samples from LO and NLO generators (pythia and powheg). The uncertainty arising from the choice of the MC hadronization model and MC generator is estimated by comparing samples generated by using pythia and herwig [31] computer codes. The systematic effect due to the leptonenergy scale uncertainty is evaluated by varying the elec-tron energy and muon momentum scales. The systematic uncertainty associated with background modeling accounts for the variations of the background template shapes, the background composition and the total background normalization. The systematic effect due to the imperfect modeling of the initial-state and final-state gluon radiation is estimated by varying the pythia parameters that control the amount of these radiations. To estimate the systematic effect due to the top-quark production mechanism (gg fraction) we vary the relative fractions of qq \u2192 tt and gg \u2192 tt sub-processes in the pythia model by reweighting the gluon fraction from 5% to 20%. We take into account the additional uncertainty on the b-jet-energy scale due to the difference in calorimeter response to jets from light quarks and b quarks and the imperfect modeling of the b-quark fragmentation and b-hadron decay branching fractions. The systematic effect due to the difference in the luminosity profile between data and MC is estimated. The color reconnection (CR) systematic uncertainty [32] is evaluated by comparing pythia MC samples generated with and without CR effects. We take into account the systematic effect stemming from the limited size of the MC samples. We estimate the systematic uncertainty due to parton distribution functions (PDFs) by comparing results from two different PDF families, varying the QCD scale, and propagating the uncertainties arising from the global fit of the CTEQ6M [33] functions. The systematic uncertainty related to the modeling of the b-tagging efficiency is also estimated. Details of the systematic uncertainty estimation are in Ref. [34].",

When varying the JES, the change in event sample accepted by the selection criteria on variables that depend on jet energies generates a change in the M alt \u2113b distribution that affects the M top measurement. We find that by varying the JES, opposite systematic shifts are induced in M reco These systematic shifts bias the M top measurement in opposite directions minimizing the JES uncertainty at w=0.12. This minimum depends only on the variables choice, M reco t and M alt \u2113b , and their sensitivity to M top . If the sample size would be large such that the statistical uncertainty could be neglected, the w=0.12 choice would be optimal for this analysis. In that scenario, the JES uncertainty would approximate zero and the non-JES uncertainty would remain as the major contributor to the total measurement uncertainty.",

The result is M top = 171.5\u00b11.9 (stat)\u00b12.5 (syst) GeV/c 2 . The measured value of M top is compatible with the world-average top-quark mass of M top = 173.34\u00b10.76 GeV/c 2 [3]. This measurement is the final CDF Run II result in the dilepton channel and supersedes the previous published value of M top = 170.3 \u00b1 2.0 (stat) \u00b1 3.1 (syst) GeV/c 2 [6]. The accuracy achieved is approximately 14% better than in the previous measurement. Most of this improvement, 9%, is due to using a new technique for optimizing the combined statistical and systematic uncertainty while the rest, 5%, is due to using a larger data sample. This technique is applicable to a wide range of measurements whose precisions are dominated by systematic uncertainties, in which an optimization between statistical and systematic uncertainty is required.
