An excess of electron neutrino interactions over background is observed from a muon neutrino beam with a peak energy of 0.6 GeV at the Super-Kamiokande (SK) detector 295 km from the beam's origin. Signal and background predictions are constrained by data from near detectors located 280 m from the neutrino production target. We observe 11 electron neutrino candidate events at the SK detector when a background of 3.3 \u00b1 0.4(syst.) events is expected. The background-only hypothesis is rejected with a p-value of 0.0009 (3.",

            "text": "The phenomena of neutrino oscillations through the mixing of massive neutrinos have been well established by experiments observing neutrino interaction rates from solar [1][2][3][4][5][6][7], atmospheric [8][9][10][11][12][13], reactor [14] and accelerator [15][16][17][18] sources. With few exceptions, such as the results from the LSND [19] and MiniBooNE collaborations [20], the observations are consistent with the mixing of three neutrinos, governed by three mixing angles: \u03b8 12 \u2248 34 \u2022 , \u03b8 23 \u2248 45 \u2022 and \u03b8 13 ; and an as-yetundetermined CP-violating phase, \u03b4 CP . Neutrino mixing also depends on three mass states, m i , and therefore two independent mass splittings, |\u2206m 2 32 | \u2248 2.4 \u00d7 10 \u22123 eV 2 (atmospheric) and \u2206m 2 21 \u2248 7.6\u00d710 \u22125 eV 2 (solar), where \u2206m 2 ij = m i 2 \u2212 m j 2 . Additional understanding of neutrino mixing can be gained by observing the appearance of one flavor of neutrino interactions in a beam of another flavor through charged current interactions. Recently, T2K [21] has reported on the appearance of electron neutrinos in a beam of muon neutrinos, and the OPERA [22] and Super-Kamiokande [23] collaborations have reported on the appearance of tau neutrinos from accelerator-based and atmospheric muon neutrino sources, respectively.",

Until recently, the mixing angle \u03b8 13 had only been constrained to be less than 11 \u2022 by reactor [24] and accelerator [25,26] neutrino experiments. With data collected through 2011, the T2K experiment found the first indication of non-zero \u03b8 13 in the oscillation of muon neutrinos to electron neutrinos [21]. Since then, a non-zero value of \u03b8 13 = 9.1 \u2022 \u00b1 0.6 \u2022  [27] has been confirmed from the disappearance of reactor electron anti-neutrinos observed by the Daya Bay [28], RENO [29] and Double Chooz [30] experiments. In this paper, T2K updates its measurement of electron neutrino appearance using additional data collected through 2012 and improved analysis methods.",

In the three-neutrino paradigm CP violation can only occur when all three mixing angles, including \u03b8 13 , have non-zero values. The second term has a negative sign for neutrinos and a positive sign for antineutrinos and violates CP, which suggests the possibility of observing CP violation by measuring the difference in the electron neutrino appearance probabilities for neutrinos and antineutrinos. Since the CP-violating term can only appear in an appearance probability, a measurement of \u03bd e appearance, such as the one described in this paper, is an important milestone towards future searches for CP violation. The A dependence in the oscillation probability arises from matter effects and introduces a dependence on the sign of \u2206m 2 32 .

The T2K neutrino beam line accepts a 31 GeV/c proton beam from the J-PARC accelerator complex. The proton beam is delivered in 5 \u00b5s long spills with a period that has been decreased from 3.64 s to 2.56 s over the data-taking periods described in this paper. Each spill consists of 8 equally spaced bunches (a significant subset of the data was collected with 6 bunches per spill) that are \u223c 15 ns wide. The protons strike a 91.4 cm long graphite target, producing hadrons including pions and kaons, and positively charged particles are focused by a series of three magnetic horns operating at 250 kA. The pions, kaons and some muons decay in a 96 m long volume to produce a predominantly muon neutrino beam. The remaining protons and particles which have not decayed are stopped in a beam dump. A muon monitor situated downstream of the beam dump measures the profile of muons from hadron decay and monitors the beam direction and intensity.",

The cylindrically-shaped water tank is optically separated to make two concentric detectors : an inner detector (ID) viewed by 11129 inward-looking 20 inch photomultipliers, and an outer detector (OD) with 1885 outward-facing 8 inch photomultipliers. The fiducial volume is defined to be a cylinder whose surface is 2 m away from the ID wall, providing a fiducial mass of 22.5 kt. Cherenkov photons from charged particles produced in neutrino interactions form ring-shaped patterns on the detector walls, and are detected by the photomultipliers. The ring topology can be used to identify the type of particle and, for charged current interactions, the flavor of the neutrino that interacted. For example, electrons from electron neutrino interactions undergo large multiple scattering and induce electromagnetic showers, resulting in fuzzy ring patterns. In contrast, the heavier muons from muon neutrino interactions produce Cherenkov rings with sharp edges. The T2K experiment uses a special software trigger to associate neutrino interactions in SK to neutrinos produced in the T2K beam. The T2K trigger records all the photomultiplier hits within \u00b1500 \u00b5s of the beam arrival time at SK. Beam timing information is measured spill-by-spill at J-PARC and immediately passed to the online computing system at SK. The time synchronization between the two sites is done using the Global Positioning System (GPS) with < 150 ns precision and is monitored with the Common-View method [43]. Spill events recorded by the T2K triggers are processed offline to apply the usual SK software triggers used to search for neutrino events, and any candidate events found are extracted for further T2K data analysis. Spills used for the far detector data analysis are selected by beam and  SK quality cuts. The primary reason spills are rejected at SK is due to the requirement that there are no events in the 100 \u00b5s before the beam window, which is necessary to reject decay electrons from cosmic-ray muons.",

The parameter values and uncertainties are further constrained by the fit to neutrino data from the T2K ND280 detector, as described in Section VII.

We compare the agreement of NEUT to the MiniBooNE CCQE data in addition to our own near detector measurement of CCQE events (Section VI) since the MiniBooNE detector has 4\u03c0 acceptance, providing a kinematic acceptance of the leptons that more closely matches the SK acceptance for the selection described in Section VIII.

These models typically modify the cross section either by enhancing the transverse component of the cross section, or by adding an additional multi-nucleon process to the existing cross section, where the neutrino interacts on a correlated pair of nucleons. Future improvements to the NEUT generator may include a full implementation of alternate CCQE models. However, these models would also require modifications to the kinematics of the exiting nucleons, but no consensus has been reached yet in the field as to how the nucleons should be treated. We consider two possible effects of alternate CCQE models on the \u03bd e appearance analysis. First, the effect in Q 2 for these models is often similar to increasing M QE A and [88] shows that other improvements to the CCQE cross section can be represented by an experiment-specific M QE A (effective), so the increase to the overall cross section from these models is approximately covered by the uncertainty on M QE",

To properly represent the neutrino flux across a wider range of off-axis angles, a separate simulation is run to model neutrino interactions in the concrete and sand which surround ND280. The scintillator detectors, including the FGD, use custom models of the scintillator photon yield, photon propagation including reflections and attenuation, and electronics response and noise. The gaseous TPC detector simulation includes the gas ionization, transverse and longitudinal diffusion of the electrons, propagation of the electrons to the readout plane through the magnetic and electric field, and a parametrization of the electronics response.

Of all negatively charged tracks, we identify the highest momentum track in each event that originates in the upstream FGD (FGD1) and enters the middle TPC (TPC2) as the \u00b5 \u2212 candidate. The negatively charged track is identified using curvature and must start inside the FGD1 fiducial volume (FV) that begins 48 mm inward from the edges of FGD1 in x and y and 21 mm inward from the upstream FGD1 edge in z. In this analysis we use only selected tracks with a vertex in FGD1, since it provides a homogeneous target for neutrino interactions. To reduce the contribution from neutrino interactions upstream of the FGD1 FV, any tracks which pass through both the upstream TPC (TPC1) and FGD1 are rejected. This also has the consequence of vetoing backward-going particles from the CC interaction vertex, so the resulting selection is predominantly forward-going \u00b5 \u2212 . The \u00b5 \u2212 candidate track energy loss is required to be consistent with a muon. The identification of particles (PID) is based on a truncated mean of measurements of energy loss in the TPC gas, from which a discriminator function is calculated for different particle hypotheses. We apply the discriminator to select muon candidates and reject electron and proton tracks. The TPC PID and TPC performance are described in more detail elsewhere [41].",

Interactions from the sand or concrete contribute to the number of tracks in the selected event, which can change a CCQElike event to a CCnonQE-like event. Interactions that occur outside of the FGD1 FV are about 7.6% of the total selected CC-inclusive sample. Sources include neutrino interactions in FGD1 outside of the FV, or particles produced in interactions downstream of FGD1 that travel backwards to stop in the FGD1 FV. Pion absorption and charge exchange interactions in the FGD material can also reduce the probability that a charged pion produces a track in TPC2, affecting the identification of an event as CCQE-like or CCnonQE-like.

We require the \u2206T 0 for selected FC events to be between \u22120.2 \u00b5s to 10 \u00b5s. We observe 240 such in-time fully contained events. We extract a fully contained sample within the fiducial volume (FCFV) by further requiring E vis to be above 30 MeV and the reconstructed vertex be 2 m away from the ID wall. We observe 174 such FCFV events, while the expected accidental contamination from events unrelated to the beam, mostly atmospheric neutrino interactions, is calculated to be 0.005 events.",

The main backgrounds are intrinsic \u03bd e contamination in the beam and NC interactions with a misidentified \u03c0 0 . The analysis relies on the well-established reconstruction techniques developed for other data samples in SK [109]. The single, electronlike ring selection criteria are unchanged from our previous measurement of electron neutrino appearance [21], and were determined from MC studies before data-taking commenced. We select CC \u03bd e candidate events which satisfy the following criteria: The E vis cut removes low energy NC interactions and electrons from the decay of unseen muons and pions, such as cosmic muons outside the beam time window or muons below Cherenkov threshold. A Michel electron is an electron from muon decay which is identified by looking for a time-delayed ID-PMT hit peak after the primary neutrino interaction. In order to reduce NC \u03c0 0 events, we utilize a special fitter which reconstructs each event with a two photon ring hypothesis. It searches for the direction and energy of the second ring which maximizes the likelihood based on the light pattern of the event [110]. Fig. 24 shows the invariant mass M inv distribution of the two photon rings for the data and simulation. As shown in the figure, the NC background component peaks around the \u03c0 0 invariant mass, hence events with M inv > 105 MeV/c 2 are cut. Finally, the energy of the parent neutrino is computed assuming CCQE kinematics and neglecting Fermi motion as follows:",

The dominant effect of a non-zero sin 2 2\u03b8 13 is to increase the overall rate of \u03bd e events. However, spectral information, e.g. electron momentum and angle with respect to the T2K beam direction, (p e , \u03b8 e ), or reconstructed neutrino energy, E rec \u03bd , can be used to further separate the signal from background. Fig. 30 shows the area-normalized (p e , \u03b8 e ) distribution for the \u03bd e candidate events predicted by the SK simulation. The signal CC \u03bd e are predominantly CCQE, and peaked at E \u03bd \u2248 0.6 GeV, near the first oscillation maximum and neutrino flux peak. This results in a clear kinematic correlation across the (p e , \u03b8 e ) distribution for signal events. This peak is also visible in the E rec \u03bd distribution for signal events, shown in Fig. 31. Conversely, the backgrounds to the \u03bd e signal populate a wider range of kinematic space. The NC backgrounds are predominantly photons misidentified as electron neutrino candidates, when one photon from \u03c0 0 decay is not reconstructed, or when the two photons are co-linear. This background predominantly populates the low momentum and forward angle region as well as the signal region. The intrinsic beam \u03bd e (\u03bd e ) backgrounds have a larger contribution of events at higher energy than the oscillated \u03bd e , and so more often produce electrons with high momentum in the forward direction. We find that based on studies of the E rec \u03bd and (p e , \u03b8 e ) kinematic distributions that the (p e , \u03b8 e ) distribution has the best power to discriminate signal and background with the minimal cross section model dependence, hence we perform a two-dimensional extended maximum likelihood fit to the (p e , \u03b8 e ) data distribution. Section IX B describes the (p e , \u03b8 e ) likelihood fit to estimate sin 2 2\u03b8 13 , and Section IX D describes two additional fits using E rec \u03bd and rate-only information for comparison to the (p e , \u03b8 e ) fit. The predicted number of \u03bd e candidates and the event shape distribution depend upon the flux, cross section parameters, oscillation probability, and the efficiency and resolution of the SK detector. We calculate the predicted number of events in a given momentum and angular bin (i) as",

The measurements do not include corrections for FSI, but do include uncertainties of interactions of the pions in the detector. To derive the NEUT predictions for these selections, we generate interactions according to the MiniBooNE flux as was done for the CCQE fits. Instead of selecting generated events based on the true neutrino interaction mode, such as CC1\u03c0 + , we select the events based on the presence of a single pion exiting the nucleus. Hence, multiple interaction types are present in the prediction for each of the MiniBooNE measurements. For example, CC1\u03c0 + interactions chiefly result in a single charged pion exiting the nucleus, but these events may instead pass the CC1\u03c0 0 selection if \u03c0 + undergoes single charge exchange within the nucleus. This interdependence within the MiniBooNE selections, as well as the fact that all three are predicted by the same model in NEUT, justifies the use of a joint fit to the three measurements.",

To achieve a fit that better reproduces the central values of the data points, we only use the diagonal terms of the NC1\u03c0 0 covariance matrix in our fit. The missing correlations also result in uncertainties on the fit parameters which do not cover the uncertainties in the data points. To remedy this, we multiply the fit parameter uncertainties by a scale factor of 2 (2.5) for CC (NC) parameters, while keeping their correlations the same. These scale factor ensure that the flux-integrated cross section uncertainty matches that given by MiniBooNE (16% for each measurement).",
