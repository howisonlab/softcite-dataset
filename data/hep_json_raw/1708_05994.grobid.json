The signature for Bose-Einstein correlations is observed in the form of an enhancement of pairs of like-sign charged pions with small four-momentum difference squared. The charged-particle multiplicity dependence of the Bose-Einstein correlation parameters describing the correlation strength and the size of the emitting source is investigated, determining both the correlation radius and the chaoticity parameter. The measured correlation radius is found to increase as a function of increasing charged-particle multiplicity, while the chaoticity parameter is seen to decrease.",

The technique to study the BEC effect in particle physics is the analogue of the Hanbury-Brown-Twiss (HBT) intensity interferometry [3][4][5]. The production of identical bosons that are close in phase space is enhanced by the presence of BEC. The measurements of the quantum interference effect between indistinguishable particles emitted by a finite-size source are useful to understand the space-time properties of the hadron emission volume.",

The densities \u03c1 2 (Q) and \u03c1 0 2 (Q) are normalised to unity, such that they can be interpreted as probability density functions. The correlation function C 2 (Q) is commonly parameterised as a Fourier transform of the source density distribution, C 2 (Q) = N (1 + \u03bbe \u2212|RQ| \u03b1 L ) [39], where the parameter R, the correlation radius, can be interpreted as the radius of the spherically symmetric source of the emission volume, N accounts for the overall normalisation and \u03bb is the chaoticity parameter, which accounts for the partial incoherence of the source [40]. The chaoticity parameter can vary from zero, in the case of a completely coherent source, to unity for an entirely chaotic source. The Levy index of stability [39], \u03b1 L , accounts for the assumed density distribution. The radial distribution of the static source corresponding to the case of \u03b1 L = 1 is used in the present analysis",

However, the opposite-sign charge pairs may also originate from resonances which result in local enhancements in the Q spectrum. Furthermore, correlations arising from the attraction of opposite charges are present in such a sample. Another method is to employ the simulated Q distribution without the BEC effect. In this case, the crucial requirement is a good level of agreement between data and simulated samples in the distributions of crucial variables, e.g. the particle momenta.

The discrepancy between data and simulated track pairs tends to increase as Q approaches zero. Investigations using simulation indicate that there is a significant fraction of pion pairs containing fake and clone tracks in the region Q < 0.05 GeV/c 2 for all activity classes. The double ratio is approximately constant and close to unity in the high-Q region up to Q \u223c 2.0 GeV/c 2 (see figure 2), which indicates that the long-range correlations are modelled accurately in this region. Consequently, the fits to the r d distributions are restricted to the range 0.05 < Q < 2.0 GeV/c 2 . The BEC effect is expected to be largest in the low-Q region below \u223c0.5 GeV/c 2 , where it may be affected by same-sign clone tracks. Such clone pion pairs should manifest themselves as an enhancement in the distribution of the differences of the tangents of the track momenta of the two particles, where the tangents are measured in the xz and yz planes before the magnet, with the z axis defined along the beam direction. The tangents are used to estimate the number of clone tracks remaining after the final selection, and the clone tracks can be suppressed with a requirement on the difference between the tangents of the two particles in a pair. Pion pairs are removed from the analysis if both |\u2206t x | and |\u2206t y | are less than 0.3 mrad, where \u2206t x and \u2206t y are the differences of the tangents of the track momenta of the two particles in the xz and yz planes.

Three activity classes are defined in the range 2 < \u03b7 < 5 according to the multiplicity of reconstructed VELO tracks assigned to a PV, which is a good probe of the total multiplicity. These activity classes are illustrated in figure 1. The low activity class corresponds to a fraction of 48% of PVs with lowest multiplicities (from 5 to 10 tracks).

In the case of unfolded multiplicities in different pseudorapidity ranges quoted by experiments, the correspondence can be found using relations obtained from simulated events. The results for pp collisions at 7 TeV published by the ATLAS experiment  and p T > 0.1 GeV/c) acceptances. The data indicate that the LHCb results for both R and \u03bb are slightly below the ATLAS ones at 7 TeV. In order to perform a more detailed comparison it would be necessary to measure the BEC parameters using a full threedimensional analysis [69].    It should be noted that the fit quality using the parameterisation, eq. (2.3), is poor (see figure 2). The \u03c7 2 values are equal to 591, 623 and 621 for 386 degrees of freedom for low, medium and high activity classes, respectively. The difference between the fitted function and the data points, visible in the whole Q range, is particularly large in the low-Q BEC signal region below 0.2 GeV/c 2 . This indicates that the approximate parameterisation of eq. (2.3) does not reproduce the measured distribution properly. Such an effect is observed also by other experiments [29,30]. This may introduce an additional systematic uncertainty in the theoretical interpretation of the fit results.",

An enhancement of pairs of same-sign charged pions with small relative momentum related to the BEC effect is observed. An event-mixed reference sample is used to determine the signal and the double ratio distributions are fitted using an exponential parameterisation. The results confirm that the effective size of the emission region increases as a function of increasing charged-particle multiplicity, while the chaoticity parameter decreases, as previously observed at LEP and at the other LHC experiments. The R and \u03bb parameters measured in the forward region in three different charged-particle multiplicity bins are slightly lower with respect to those measured by ATLAS for corresponding pp interaction multiplicities.",
