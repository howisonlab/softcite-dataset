The B 0 \u2192 [cc]K 0 S family of decay modes, where [cc] denotes a charmonium resonance (J/\u03c8 , \u03c8(2S), \u03b7 c , etc.), is ideal for studying CP violation [3,4]. Such decays proceed via a b \u2192 [cc]s transition, where higher-order contributions that could introduce additional strong and weak phases in the decay amplitudes are expected to be small [5][6][7].

Different types of charged hadrons are distinguished using information from two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors. Photons, electrons, and hadrons are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter, and a hadronic calorimeter.

The BDTs are trained using simulated signal samples and background samples consisting of B 0 candidates with invariant masses above the considered regions, i.e. 5600 < m(J/\u03c8 K 0 S ) < 6000 MeV/c 2 or 5450 < m(\u03c8(2S)K 0 S ) < 5500 MeV/c 2 . The BDTs exploit features related to kinematic and topological properties of the decay, along with track-and vertex-reconstruction qualities. The common BDT features of the two decay modes are p T (K 0 S ), p T ([cc]), the \u03c7 2 values of the kinematic fits, and the minimum and maximum of log(\u03c7 2 IP ) for each pion and for each lepton, where \u03c7 2 IP is defined as the increase in \u03c7 2 when including the track in the PV fit. In addition to the common variables, the BDT for the J/\u03c8 mode includes p T (B 0 ), \u03c7 2 IP (J/\u03c8 ), \u03c7 2 IP (K 0 S ), and the B 0 -decay vertex-fit quality, \u03c7 2 vtx (B 0 ). The BDT for the \u03c8(2S) mode includes \u03c7 2 vtx (K 0 S ), and the K 0 S decay-time significance, t/\u03c3 t (K 0 S ). The requirements on the BDT responses are chosen to maximise the expected sensitivity on the CP observable S.",

Multiple flavour-tagging algorithms are combined to achieve the best response. Each tagging algorithm provides a decision (tag), d \u2208 {\u22121, 0, 1}, corresponding to a B 0 candidate tagged as B 0 , untagged or tagged as B 0 , respectively, and the mistag probability estimate, \u03b7. The tagging algorithms are categorised as sameside, SS, and opposite-side, OS [22][23][24]. The SS taggers exploit particles created in the fragmentation process of the B 0 meson, while the OS taggers use decay products of the accompanying b hadron that is produced in association with the signal B 0 meson. The combination of OS taggers used in this analysis is based on different possible final states in the decay of the other b hadron in the event. The tagging responses are determined from the charges of muons, electrons or kaons; a weighted average of the charges of all tracks; and the decay products of charm decays possibly originating from the other b hadron in the event. In the case of the SS taggers the tagging decision is based on the charges of the pions and the protons originating from the fragmentation process of the signal B 0 mesons. The OS and SS decisions, d OS and d SS , and their mistag estimates, \u03b7 OS and \u03b7 SS , are combined for each B 0 candidate. The tags d OS and d SS are combined event-byevent during the fit procedure, taking into account their per-candidate mistag estimates.",

The corresponding effects are studied using simulated pseudoexperiments in which ensembles are generated using parameters that differ from those used in the nominal fit. The generated datasets are then fitted with the nominal model to test whether biases in the parameters of interest occur. The effect of neglecting \u2206\u0393 in the nominal model is studied by varying its value within one standard deviation of its current experimental uncertainty [8]. Effects coming from the constrained inputs are evaluated by varying their values by one standard deviation in terms of their systematic experimental uncertainties. The constrained inputs are the production asymmetry parameters, the oscillation frequency, \u2206m, the lifetime, \u03c4 , as well as the tagging-calibration parameters. The systematic uncertainty arising due to the decay-time bias is evaluated using pseudoexperiments in which a corresponding value of 3 fs is assumed. Furthermore, deviations in the scaling of \u03c3 t are estimated at the level of \u00b130 % and addressed through varying the corresponding factors by this amount. Possible inaccuracies in the decay-time-reconstruction efficiency are studied using a different parameterization obtained from data. Table 3 summarizes the results of these studies. The individual uncertainties are added in quadrature to obtain the overall systematic uncertainties.",
