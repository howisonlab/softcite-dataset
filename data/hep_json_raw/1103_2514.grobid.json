The lifetime measurements ( Fig. 1) were made using high signal-to-background D 0 samples consisting of 10 331 decays into K \u2212 K + , and 119 738 decays into K \u2212 \u03c0 + . The measurement of lifetime differences corresponded to a direct measurement of the mixing parameter y CP = (\u0393(CP even) \u2212 \u0393(CP odd))/(\u0393(CP even) + \u0393(CP odd)) = 0.0342 \u00b1 0.0139 \u00b1 0.0074. Such a first evidence for nonzero mixing was followed by higher-statistics measurements from B-factories. Fig.2 from a 2003 review paper 3 shows the FOCUS measurement compared to the existing studies. With a moderate significance due to low statistics, FOCUS showed evidence for a nonzero lifetime difference. Recent results from BABAR and BELLE have solidly established the observation of D mixing. Algorithms and selections used by FOCUS may be used by forward-geometry experiment LHCb at the CERN LHC with much larger statistics very soon.",

There is a well-known technical complication: strong phases can produce a nonzero value of A T , even if the weak phases are zero, that is CP and T violation are not necessarily present.

Such a correlation must necessarily involve at least four final-state particles. This can be understood by considering the rest frame of the decaying particle and invoking momentum conservation.

One needs to build a model for the FSI based on chiral perturbation theory, but this is rather challenging even for three-body final states.

This, however, changes the assignment of the final state, since K s \u03c6 is a CP-odd state, while K s f 0 is CP-even. These considerations forced, in early 2000s, the B-factory experiments to revisit their analyses of some decay modes such as B 0 \u2192 K s K \u2212 K + .

FOCUS gave hints of unexpected phenomena such as a positive value for the y CP parameter in charm mixing, which is still today debated subject of studies, and possibly the only mixing parameter significantly different from zero observed so far. FOCUS did pioneering work for three-body final states to help us in the future to find CPV in D decays, and to help understand CP searches in B decays.Future searches for CPV from New Physics need much more experimental and theoretical work. Finally, FOCUS did pioneering work in D \u2192 4h, useful for the future and showing that more theoretical work is needed. From the experimental side, while BaBar/BELLE reached the 1% level in CPV limits, much more statistics is needed to reach the 0.1% level where NP can generate effects.",
