This is mainly due to the fact that the B 0 s -B 0 s oscillation frequency is 35 times larger than that for the B 0 -B 0 system, posing a considerable challenge for the decay time resolution of detectors. For the LHCb experiment, the ability to resolve these fast B 0 s -B 0 s oscillations is a prerequisite for many physics analyses. In particular it is essential for the study of the time-dependent CP asymmetry of B 0 s \u2192 J /\u03c8\u03c6 decays [4]. The oscillation frequency in the B 0 s -B 0 s system is given by the mass difference between the heavy and light mass eigenstates, m s (we use units withh = 1). In this Letter, we report a measurement of m s by the LHCb experiment with data collected in 2010.",

The first trigger level is implemented in hardware, while the second trigger level is based on software. Trigger conditions were progressively tightened over the duration of the data taking period to cope with the rapidly increasing instantaneous luminosities delivered by the LHC. In the hardware trigger, the events used in this analysis were selected by requiring a cluster with a minimum transverse energy in the hadronic calorimeter. The applied threshold was increased from 2.5 to 3.6 GeV throughout the data taking period. A cut on the number of hits in the SPD detector was applied to reject very high occupancy events. The software trigger for the first 2.4 pb \u22121 of data required a good quality displaced vertex reconstructed from two tracks with transverse momenta p T of at least 500 MeV/c. For the remaining data, a two-level software trigger was applied. A good quality track with large impact parameter with respect to the primary vertex was required with p T > 1.85 GeV/c and momentum p > 13.3 GeV/c [6]. For events passing these criteria, a good quality displaced vertex was required, formed out of two tracks with p T > 0.5 GeV/c and p > 5 GeV/c and with a mass variable in the range 2 to 7 GeV/c 2 [7]. Some of the offline event selection criteria are optimized individually for each of the four decay modes under study. In this way specific features such as the masses of the intermediate \u03c6 and K * 0 resonances or the helicity angle distribution of the K * 0 can be used. The selection criteria common to all decay modes exploit the long B 0 s lifetime by applying cuts on the impact parameters of the daughter tracks, on the angle of the reconstructed B 0 s momentum relative to the line between the reconstructed primary vertex and the B 0 s vertex and on the B 0 s decay time. Additional cuts are applied on the p and p T of the B 0 s candidate and its decay products as well as on particle identification variables and on track and vertex quality. Finally, cuts on the impact parameter significance of the reconstructed D \u2212 s and its distance of closest approach to the primary vertex are applied. The reconstructed D \u2212 s mass is required to be consistent with the PDG value [8]. After this selection, a total of about 14,400 candidates remain in the B 0",

From an independent analysis of the mass scale using various known resonances an uncertainty of the uncalibrated momentum scale of less than 0.1% is estimated.

The step function \u03b8(t) restricts the PDF to positive decay times.The true decay time is convolved with the decay time resolution function of the detector. An event-by-event estimate of the decay time resolution is calculated by the fitting algorithm, which reconstructs the decay vertex of the B 0 s and computes its decay length and decay time. No constraint on the D \u2212 s mass is applied in the computation of the decay time in order to minimize sensitivity to the knowledge of the momentum scale of the experiment. The decay time uncertainty calculated by the fitting algorithm does not include possible effects from an imperfect understanding of the detector material or its spatial alignment. To correct for such effects, the calculated event-by-event decay time uncertainties, \u03c3 t , are multiplied by a constant scale factor S \u03c3 t . The value of S \u03c3 t is determined from data, using a sample of fake B0 s candidates formed by a prompt D \u2212 s and a \u03c0 + from the primary vertex. The contamination due to secondary D \u2212 s from B decays is estimated and statistically subtracted using the measured D \u2212 s impact parameter distribution. The distribution of decay times for this fake B 0 s sample, each divided by its calculated event-by-event uncertainty, is fitted with a Gaussian function and S \u03c3 t is taken as the resulting standard deviation. Using the full sample of fake B 0 s candidates, a value of S \u03c3 t = 1.3 is obtained. This value is used as the nominal scale factor in the m s analysis. Studying different regions of phase space of the fake B 0 s candidates separately, values for S \u03c3 t between 1.2 and 1.4 are obtained. This variation is taken into account for evaluating the systematic uncertainties on m s . Including the nominal scale factor S \u03c3 t = 1.3, the average decay time resolution is 44 fs for the B 0 s \u2192 D \u2212 s \u03c0 + sample and 36 fs for the B 0 s \u2192 D \u2212 s \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + sample.
