This approach to search for NP is complementary to that used by the ATLAS and CMS experiments. While the high-p T experiments search for on-shell production of new particles, LHCb can look for their effects in processes that are precisely predicted in the SM. In particular, the SM has a highly distinctive flavour structure, with no tree-level flavour-changing neutral currents, and quark mixing described by the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix [20,21] which has a single source of CP violation. This structure is not necessarily replicated in extended models. Historically, new particles have first been seen through their virtual effects since this approach allows one to probe mass scales beyond the energy frontier. For example, the observation of CP violation in the kaon system [22] was, in hindsight, the discovery of the third family of quarks, well before the observations of the bottom and top quarks. Crucially, measurements of both high-p T and flavour observables are necessary in order to decipher the nature of NP.",

In particular, the development of trigger algorithms that select events inclusively based on properties of b-hadron decays [23,24] facilitates a much broader output than previously foreseen. On the other hand, limitations imposed by the hardware trigger lead to a maximum instantaneous luminosity at which data can most effectively be collected (higher luminosity requires tighter trigger thresholds, so that there is no gain in yields, at least for channels that do not involve muons). To overcome this limitation, an upgrade of the LHCb experiment has been proposed to be installed during the long shutdown of the LHC planned for 2018. The upgraded detector will be read out at the maximum LHC bunch-crossing frequency of 40 MHz so that the trigger can be fully implemented in software. With such a flexible trigger strategy, the upgraded LHCb experiment can be considered as a general purpose detector in the forward region.",

Charged hadrons are identified using two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors. Photon, electron and hadron candidates are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter and a hadronic calorimeter. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers. The trigger consists of a hardware stage, based on information from the calorimeter and muon systems, followed by a software stage which applies a full event reconstruction.",

The majority of the data was recorded at an instantaneous luminosity of L inst = 3.5 \u00d7 10 32 cm \u22122 s \u22121 , nearly a factor of two above the LHCb design value, and with a pile-up rate (average number of visible interactions per crossing) of \u03bc \u223c 1.5 (four times the nominal value, but below the rates of up to \u03bc \u223c 2.5 seen in 2010). A luminosity levelling procedure, where the beams are displaced at the LHCb interaction region, allows LHCb to maintain an approximately constant luminosity throughout each LHC fill. This procedure permitted reliable operation of the experiment and a stable trigger configuration throughout 2011. The hardware stage of the trigger produced output at around 800 kHz, close to the nominal 1 MHz, while the output of the software stage was around 3 kHz, above the nominal 2 kHz, divided roughly equally between channels with muons, b decays to hadrons and charm decays. During data taking, the magnet polarity was flipped at a frequency of about one cycle per month in order to collect equal sized data samples of both polarities for periods of stable running conditions. Thanks to the excellent performance of the LHCb detector, the overall data taking efficiency exceeded 90 %.",

This framework is known as the operator product expansion, and is described in more detail in, e.g., Refs. [33,34]. In many concrete models, the operators that are most sensitive to NP are a subset of  3 While the radiative b \u2192 q\u03b3 decays are sensitive only to the magnetic and chromomagnetic operators, semileptonic b \u2192 q + \u2212 decays are, in principle, sensitive to all these operators. 4 In the SM, models with minimal flavour violation (MFV) [35,36] and models with a flavour symmetry relating the first two generations [37], the Wilson coefficients appearing in Eq. (1) are equal for q = d or s and the ratio of amplitudes for b \u2192 d relative to b \u2192 s transitions is suppressed by |V td /V ts |. Due to this suppression, at the current level of experimental precision, constraints on decays with a b \u2192 d transition are much weaker than those on decays with a b \u2192 s transition for constraining C ( ) i .

The increasing size of the experimental samples makes it important to design optimised observables (by using specifically chosen combinations of the J i ) to reduce theoretical uncertainties. In the low q 2 region, the linear dependence of the amplitudes on the soft form factors allows for a complete cancellation of the hadronic uncertainties due to the form factors at leading order. This consequently increases the sensitivity to the structure of NP models [53,54]. In the low q 2 region, the so-called transversity observables A (i) T , i = 2, 3, 4, 5 are an example set of observables that are constructed such that the soft form factor dependence cancels out at leading order. They represent the complete set of angular observables and are chosen to be highly sensitive to new right-handed currents via C 7 [53,54]. A second, complete, set of optimised angular observables was constructed (also in the cases of non-vanishing lepton masses and in the presence of scalar operators) in Ref. [55]. Recently the effect of binning in q 2 on these observables has been considered [72]. In these sets of observables, the unknown \u039b QCD /m b corrections are estimated to be of order 10 % on the level of the spin amplitudes and represent the dominant source of theory uncertainty.",

In particular, the observables S 3 , A 9 and the CP-asymmetries A 7 and A 8 vanish at leading order in \u039b QCD /m b and \u03b1 S in the SM operator basis [64]. Importantly, this suppression is absent in extensions with non-vanishing chirality-flipped C 7,9,10 , giving rise to contributions proportional to Re(C i C * j ) or Im(C i C * j ) and making these terms ideal probes of right-handed currents [53,54,62,64]. CP asymmetries are small in the SM, be-cause the only CP-violating phase affecting the decay is doubly Cabibbo-suppressed, but can be significantly enhanced by NP phases in C 9,10 and C 9,10 , which at present are poorly constrained. In a full angular analysis it can also be shown that CP-conserving observables provide indirect constraints on CP-violating NP contributions [54].",

The extraction of form factor ratios is already possible with current data on S 3 (A (2) T ) and F L and leads to a consistent picture between LCSR calculations, lattice calculations and experimental data [41,74]. In the presence of chiralityflipped Wilson coefficients, these observables are no longer short-distance free, but are probes of right-handed currents [42].

The NP contributions from these models usually arise via (C 10 -C 10 ), and they are therefore correlated with the constraints from other b \u2192 s + \u2212 processes, e.g. with B(B + \u2192 K + \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 ) which depends on (C 10 + C 10 ). The term (C P -C P ) in the branching fraction adds coherently with the SM contribution from (C 10 -C 10 ), and therefore can also destructively interfere. In such cases, if (C S -C S ) remains small, B(B 0 s \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 ) could be smaller than the SM prediction. A measurement of B(B 0 s \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 ) well below the SM prediction would be a clear indication of NP and would be symptomatic of a model with a large non-degeneracy in the scalar sector (where C ( ) P is enhanced but C ( ) S is not). If only C 10 is modified, these constraints currently require the branching ratio to be above 1.1 \u00d7 10 \u221210 [42]. In the presence of NP effects in both C 10 and C 10 , even stronger suppression is possible in principle.",

The other [145] uses semileptonic decays, exploiting the expected equality of the semileptonic widths [146,147]. However, the two methods have a common, and dominant, uncertainty which originates from the measurement of B(D + s \u2192 K + K \u2212 \u03c0 + ), which in the PDG is given to 4.9 % (coming from a single measurement from CLEO [148]). A new preliminary result from Belle has recently been presented [149]-inclusion of this measurement in the world average will improve the uncertainty on B(D + s \u2192 K + K + \u03c0 + ) to \u223c3.5 %. With the samples available with the LHCb upgrade, it will be possible to go beyond branching fraction measurements and study the effective lifetime of B 0 s \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 , that provides additional sensitivity to NP [136].",

In many NP models, contributions to third generation quarks/leptons can be dramatically enhanced with respect to the first and second generation. This is true in, for example, scalar and pseudoscalar interactions in supersymmetric scenarios, for large values of tan \u03b2. Interestingly, there is also an interplay between b \u2192 s\u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 processes and the lifetime difference \u0393 s 12 in B 0 s mixing (see Sect. 3). The correlation of both processes has been discussed modelindependently [152,153] and in specific scenarios, such as 17 This value is valid for B mesons produced from \u221a s = 7 TeV pp collisions within the LHCb acceptance. It will, in principle, need to be remeasured at each different LHC collision energy, and may depend on the kinematic acceptance of the detector (i.e. on the transverse momentum and pseudorapidity of the B mesons). However, once a suitable B 0 s branching fraction, such as that for B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c6 or B 0 s \u2192 K + K \u2212 , is known to good precision, normalisation can be carried out without direct need for an f d /f s value. 18 The results from Ref. [140] were updated at HCP2012 [141]. leptoquarks [154,155] or Z models [156][157][158]. There are presently no experimental limits on B 0 s \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 , however the interplay with \u0393 s 12 , and the latest LHCb-measurement of \u0393 d /\u0393 s would imply a limit of B(B 0 s \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 ) < 3 % at 90 % C.L. Any improvement on this limit, which might be in reach with the existing LHCb data set, would yield strong constraints on models that couple strongly to third generation leptons. A large enhancement in b \u2192 s\u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 could help to understand the anomaly observed by the D0 experiment in their measurement of the inclusive dimuon asymmetry [159] and could also reduce the tension that exists with other mixing observables [152,153].",

The \u03c4 leptons must be reconstructed in decays that involve at least one missing neutrino. Although it has been demonstrated that the decay Z \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 can be separated from background at LHCb, using both leptonic and hadronic decay modes [160], at lower energies the backgrounds from semileptonic heavy flavour decays cause the use of the leptonic decay modes to be disfavoured. However, in the case that \"three-prong\" \u03c4 decays are used, the vertices can be reconstructed from the three hadron tracks. The analysis can then benefit from the excellent vertexing capability of LHCb, and, due to the finite lifetime of the \u03c4 lepton, there are in principle sufficient kinematic constraints to reconstruct the decay. Work is in progress to understand how effectively the different potential background sources can be suppressed, and hence how sensitive LHCb can be in this channel. ",

As a consequence, NP with non-standard CP violation is in fact constrained more weakly than NP where CP violation stems only from the CKM phase. This highlights the need for improved measurements of CP asymmetries directly sensitive to non-standard phases. 20 Significant improvements of these constraints-or first hints for physics beyond the SM-can be obtained in the future by both improved measurements of the observables dis-cussed above and by improvements on the theoretical side. From the theory side, there is scope for improving the estimates of the hadronic form factors from lattice calculations, which will reduce the dominant source of uncertainty on the exclusive decays. On the experimental side there are a large number of theoretically clean observables that can be extracted with a full angular analysis of First consider the constrained minimal supersymmetric standard model (CMSSM) and a model with non-universal Higgs masses (NUHM1).

The largest effect stems from left-right mixing between top and charm super-partners. Due to the Zpenguin dominance of the SUSY-flavour contributions the constraints are most effective for the Wilson coefficient C 10 (see Sect. 2.2). SUSY effects in C 10 are reduced from about 50 % to 16 % (28 %) at 68 (95) % C.L. by the recent data on the rare decay B 0 \u2192 K * 0 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 [167]. The constraints are relevant to flavour models based on radiative flavour violation (see, e.g., Ref. [169]), and exclude solutions to the flavour problem with flavour generation in the up-sector and sub-TeV spectra. The flavour constraints are stronger for lighter stops, hence there is an immediate interplay with direct searches. Figure 8 shows the (M A , tan\u03b2) plane from fits of the CMSSM and NUHM1 parameter space to the current data from SUSY and Higgs searches in ATLAS and CMS, as well as dark matter relic density [129,170]. The study in constrained MSSM scenarios is illustrative but not representative of the full MSSM. The strong constraints provided by the current data in the CMSSM are not necessarily reproduced in more general scenarios. To go beyond the constrained scenarios, consider the phenomenological MSSM (pMSSM) [171]. This model is the most general CP-and Rparity-conserving MSSM, assuming MFV at the weak scale and the absence of FCNCs at tree level. It contains 19 free parameters: 10 sfermion masses, 3 gaugino masses, 3 trilinear couplings and 3 Higgs masses. To study the impact of the B 0 s \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 results on the pMSSM, the parameter space is scanned and for each point in the space the consistency of the model with experimental bounds is tested [172]. The left panel of Fig. 9 shows the density of points as a function of M A before and after applying the combined 2010 LHCb and CMS B 0 s \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 limit (1.1 \u00d7 10 \u22128 at 95 % C.L. [173]), as well as the projection for a SM-like measurement with an overall 20 % theoretical and experimental uncertainty. As can be seen the density of the allowed pMSSM points is reduced by a factor of 3, in the case of a SM-like measurement. The right panel shows the same distribution in the (M A , tan \u03b2) plane. Similar to the CMSSM case, the region with large tan \u03b2 and small M A is most affected by the experimental constraints.",

By using the same notation for different decays, an assumption that arg(\u0100 f /A f ) is common for different final states is being made. This corresponds to an assumption that the penguin contributions to these decays are negligible. Although this is reasonable with the current precision, as the measurements improve it will be necessary to remove such assumptionsseveral methods to test the contributions of penguin amplitudes are discussed below. These include measuring \u03c6 q with different decay processes governed by different quarklevel transitions. Previous experiments have used the notation 2\u03b2 eff in particular for measurements based on b \u2192 qqs (q = u, d, s) transitions; for symmetry the notation 2\u03b2 eff s is used in corresponding cases in the B 0 s system, although the cancellation of the mixing and decay phases in B 0 s decays governed by b \u2192 qqs amplitudes is expected to lead to a vanishing CP violation effect (within small theoretical uncertainties).",

The latest  [219] HFAG average in Table 1 combines the LHCb results with the B 0 s \u2192 J /\u03c8\u03c6 analysis results from CDF using 9.6 fb \u22121 [237] and D0 using 8.0 fb \u22121 [238].

Future updates of these analyses will gain in sensitivity by also using the same side kaon tagging information, which so far has been used in a preliminary determination of m s [226,241]. Currently, the systematic uncertainty on \u03c6 s is dominated by imperfect knowledge of the background, angular acceptance effects and by neglecting potential contributions of direct CP violation. All of these uncertainties are expected to be reduced with more detailed understanding and some improvements in the analysis. Therefore it is expected that the determination of \u03c6 s will remain limited by statistical uncertainties, even with the data samples available after the upgrade of the LHCb detector. In addition to B 0 s \u2192 J /\u03c8\u03c6 and [243] will be investigated. These decays have been measured at LHCb [244,245].",

The analysis gives s consistent with the SM, within large uncertainties, whereas the more precise data in the B 0 system hint at a deviation in d (see Fig. 13). Moreover, NP effects up to 30-40 % are still allowed in both systems at the 3\u03c3 level. It should be noted, that the large deviations in the B 0 sector are not only due to A b SL , but also due to the tension between sin \u03c6 d and B(B + \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03bd).",

The popular Wolfenstein parametrisation allows for a transparent expansion of the CKM matrix in terms of the sine of the small Cabibbo angle, \u03bb, with the other three parameters being A,\u03c1 and\u03b7. Assuming the validity of the SM, one can perform a fit to the available measurements. LHCb results already make important contributions to the constraints on \u03b3 and m s . With more statistics, LHCb results are expected to impact on other CKM fit inputs, including \u03b1 and sin 2\u03b2. It is important to note the crucial role of lattice QCD calculations as input to the CKM fits. For example, the parameters f B s B B s and \u03be enter the constraints on m s and m d / m s . At the end of 2011, the precision of the calculations was at the level of 5.4 % and 2.6 %, respectively [109]. The necessary further progress to obtain the full benefit of the LHCb measurements appears to be in hand exploiting algorithmic advances as well as ever increasing computing power for the lattice calculations.",

The results of the studies by both groups point to the absence of big NP effects in B = 2 processes. Nevertheless there is still significant room for NP in mixing in both B 0 and B 0 s systems. More precise results, in particular from LHCb, can enable more careful studies. Besides providing null tests of the SM hypothesis, improved \u03c6 s and a s sl measurements are crucial to quantity effects of NP in mixing.

The reason for the large allowed range of the shift of \u03c6 d is due to the limited precision to which the corresponding control channels B 0 \u2192 J /\u03c8\u03c0 0 and B 0 s \u2192 J /\u03c8K 0 , which are Cabibbo-suppressed compared to the golden modes, are known. For \u03c6 s , an analogous analysis [277] cannot yet constrain the penguin contribution, due to the lack of a B \u2192 J /\u03c8V control channel data for B 0 s \u2192 J /\u03c8\u03c6. However, in principle the effects in the B \u2192 J /\u03c8V modes are expected to be of the same order of magnitude as in the B \u2192 J /\u03c8P modes. The control channel B 0 s \u2192 J /\u03c8K * 0 has already been observed at CDF [282] and LHCb [283], and work is ongoing to measure its decay rate, polarisations and direct CP asymmetries. This will enable the first direct constraint on the shift of \u03c6 s due to penguin contributions in the decay B 0 s \u2192 J /\u03c8\u03c6. 36 For B 0 s \u2192 J /\u03c8f 0 (980) there is an additional complication due to the unknown hadronic structure of the f 0 (980) [235].",

            "text": "In addition to insufficient data, there are, at present, theoretical aspects limiting the precision of this method at present, the most important of which is the violation of SU(3) symmetry. Regarding the B 0 mixing phase, a full SU(3) analysis can be performed [285] (instead of using only one control channel) to be able to model-independently include SU(3) breaking. The inclusion of SU(3)-breaking contributions is important: their neglect can lead to an overestimation of the subleading effects. Including recent data for two of the relevant modes [286,287], the analysis shows that the data are at the moment actually compatible with vanishing penguin contributions, with SU(3)-breaking contributions of the order 20 %. Including the penguin contributions, an upper limit on the shift of the mixing-induced CP asymmetry S = sin \u03c6 d \u2212 sin 2\u03b2 is derived: | S| 0.01, with a negative sign for S slightly preferred. 37 This is the most stringent limit available, despite the more general treatment of SU(3) breaking. In this analysis still some (conservatively chosen) theoretical inputs are needed to exclude fine-tuned solutions: SU(3)-breaking effects have been restricted to at most 40 % for a few parameters which are not well determined by the fit and also have only small influence on the CP violation observables, and the penguin matrix elements are constrained to be at most 50 % of the 36 Other data-driven methods to control penguin contributions to B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c6 have been proposed [284]. 37 Note the definition of S here has a sign difference to that in Ref. [285]. leading contributions. Importantly, these theory inputs can be replaced by experimental measurements, namely of the CP asymmetries in the decay B 0 s \u2192 J /\u03c8K 0 S , the decay rate of which has already been measured at LHCb [287] after its observation at CDF [282]. Furthermore, data from all the corresponding modes (i.e. B d,u,s \u2192 J /\u03c8P , with light pseudoscalar meson P = \u03c0, \u03b7 ( ) or K) can be used to determine the shift more precisely, i.e. the related uncertainty is not irreducible, but can be reduced with coming data.",

Table 3 shows the current results with 1.0 fb \u22121 and the projected precision for 50 fb \u22121 with the upgraded detector. A precision of <10 mrad is expected for 50 fb \u22121 with the upgraded detector. It is expected that even with this data sample, the main limitation will be statistical: the largest systematic uncertainties on the current measurement (background description, angular acceptance, effect of fixed physics parameters) [139] are expected to be removed with more sophisticated analyses or to scale with statistics. Thus changes as small as a factor of two with respect to the SM should be observable with 3\u03c3 significance. This precision will make it possible either to measure a significant deviation from the SM prediction or otherwise to place severe constraints on NP scenarios. As discussed in Sect. 3.2.5, contributions from doubly CKM-suppressed SM penguin diagrams could have a nonnegligible effect on the mixing-induced CP asymmetry and bias the extracted value of \u03c6 s . Naive estimates of the bias are of the order O(10 \u22123 ) only [272][273][274], but this must be examined with experimental data using flavour symmetries to exploit control channels. LHCb can perform an SU(3) analysis using measurements of the decays rates and CP asymmetries in B 0 s \u2192 J /\u03c8K * 0 , B 0 \u2192 J /\u03c8\u03c1 0 and B 0 \u2192 J /\u03c8\u03c6 as control channels for B 0 s \u2192 J /\u03c8\u03c6. The necessary high precision can only be reached using the large data sample that will be collected with the upgraded LHCb detector. The 50 fb \u22121 data sample will also allow to measure \u03c6 s in the penguin-free (b \u2192 c\u016bs/ucs) B 0 s \u2192 D\u03c6 decay [288,289]. Another important goal is a more precise determination of sin 2\u03b2 in the B 0 system, motivated by the tension between the direct and indirect determinations of sin 2\u03b2 seen by both UTfit and CKMfitter groups, as shown in Table 2. With the upgraded detector, using the B 0 \u2192 J /\u03c8K 0 S final state alone, a statistical precision of \u00b10.006 is expected, to be compared to the current error from the B factories of \u00b10.023 [190]. Given experience with the current detector it seems feasible to control the systematic uncertainties to a similar level. Such precision, together with better control of the penguin pollution, will allow us to pin down any NP effects in B 0 mixing. In addition, the penguin-free (b \u2192 c\u016bd/ucd) B 0 \u2192 D\u03c1 0 channel can be used to get another handle on sin 2\u03b2 [290,291].",

Higher order corrections from subleading diagrams are expected to be small compared to the precision that can be achieved in the near-term, but further theoretical studies will be needed as the upgrade era approaches. NP with a flavour structure different from the SM will alter these CP asymmetries through the decay amplitudes, even if there is no NP in B mixing. A number of quasitwo-body or three-body decay modes can be studied. \u2022 Correlations between direct and mixing-induced asymmetries. Penguin-only decay modes are particularly interesting as the difference between formal \"tree\" and \"penguin\" contributions boils down to a difference in the quarkflavour running in the loop of the penguins. This difference, dominated by short distances, can be assessed accurately using QCD factorisation, and it can be used to correlate the branching ratio and the CP asymmetries of penguin-mediated modes. As discussed in Refs. [138,301,302], these observables can be correlated not only within the SM, but can also be used to extract the B 0 s mixing phase even in the presence of NP affecting only this phase. ",

Several established methods to measure \u03b3 in tree decays exploit the B \u2212 \u2192 D ( * ) K ( * )\u2212 decays. They are based on the interference between the b \u2192 u and b \u2192 c tree amplitudes, which arises when the neutral D meson is reconstructed in a final state accessible to both D 0 and D 0 decays. The interference between the amplitudes results in observables that depend on their relative weak phase \u03b3 . Besides \u03b3 they also depend on hadronic parameters, namely the ratio of magnitudes of amplitudes r B \u2261 |A(b \u2192 u)/A(b \u2192 c)| and the relative strong phase \u03b4 B between the two amplitudes. These hadronic parameters depend on the B decay under investigation. They can not be precisely calculated from theory (see, however, Ref. [310]), but can be extracted directly from data by simultaneously reconstructing several different D final states.",

The correlation column refers to that between S f and C f measurements. Except for the preliminary results in Ref. [356], all other measurements have been averaged by HFAG [44]. The CP asymmetry of B + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 0 has been reported for completeness, although it has not been used in the analysis. New results on time-dependent CP violation in B 0 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 reported by Belle at CKM2012 [358] are not included  [ 356,364,367] a precious source of information on the phase of the CKM matrix. Although the method allows a full determination of the weak phase and of the relevant hadronic parameters, it suffers from discrete ambiguities that limit its constraining power. It is however possible to reduce the impact of discrete ambiguities by adding information on hadronic parameters [351,352]. In particular, as noted in Refs. [353][354][355], the hadronic parameters entering the B 0 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and the B 0 s \u2192 K + K \u2212 decays are connected by U-spin, so that experimental knowledge of B 0 s \u2192 K + K \u2212 can improve the extraction of the CKM phase with the GL analysis. Indeed, in Ref. [352], the measurement of B(B 0 s \u2192 K + K \u2212 ) was used to obtain an upper bound on one of the hadronic parameters.",

[357], the authors propose to perform a combined analysis of the GL modes plus B 0 s \u2192 K + K \u2212 to obtain an optimal determination of the CKM phase within the SM. They show that this combined strategy has a milder dependence on the magnitude of Uspin breaking, allowing for a more solid estimate of the theory error. The experimental data used for such a determination of \u03b3 are summarised in Table 6. The time-dependent asymmetry for a B meson decay to a CP eigenstate f can be written, with the same notation as Eqs. (65) and (66), 45 as 45 In the LHCb preliminary results on [356] a different notation has been used:",

However, for the purpose of connecting B \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0 to B 0 s \u2192 KK it is more convenient to use the parametrisation in Eq. (76). In this way, \u03b1 (or, equivalently, \u03b3 ), is determined up to discrete ambiguities, that correspond however to different values of the hadronic parameters. As discussed in detail in Ref. [352], the shape of the PDF obtained in a Bayesian analysis depends on the allowed range for the hadronic parameters. For example, using the data in Table 6, solving for C and choosing flat a pri- Fig. 20 is obtained, corresponding to \u03b3 = (68 \u00b1 15) \u2022 (\u03b3 \u2208 [25,87] \u2022 at 95 % probability).

However, the combined analysis described above, in the framework of a global SM fit, can serve for the same purpose. To illustrate this point, the GL+F analysis is performed, taking as input the SM fit result \u03b3 = (69.7 \u00b1 3.1) \u2022 [270] and not using the measurement of 2\u03b2 s from b \u2192 ccs decays.

Due to the resonant structure in multibody decays, these can offer additional possibilities to search for both the existence and features of NP. Model-independent analyses [374,375] can be performed to first establish the presence of a CP violation effect, and then to identify the regions of the phase space in which it is most pronounced. 49 To further establish whether any observed CP violation can be accommodated within the Standard Model, amplitude analyses can be used to quantify the effects associated with resonant contributions to the decay. A number of methods have been proposed to determine \u03b3 from such processes [378][379][380][381][382][383][384][385][386][387], in general requiring input not only from charged B decays, but also from B 0 and B 0 s decays (to states such as K 0 S h + h \u2212 and \u03c0 0 h + h \u2212 ). 50 The potential for LHCb to study multibody charmless \u039b 0 b decays adds further possibilities for novel studies of CP violation effects.",

Comparisons of the values obtained provide tests of NP, and so precision measurements from both methods are needed. Among the tree-dominated processes, in addition to the modes discussed above, any channel that involves the interference of b \u2192 c\u016bs and b \u2192 ucs transitions is potentially sensitive to \u03b3 . Many of these modes can be analysed in the upgraded phase of LHCb, including 1. B + \u2192 DK + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + where, similarly to the B \u2192 DK mode, the neutral D can be reconstructed either in the two-body (ADS and GLW-like measurement) or multibody (GGSZ-like measurement) final state. The observation of the CF mode in LHCb data [389] indicates a yield only twice lower than that for the B \u2192 DK mode, which makes it competitive for the measurement of \u03b3 . 51 However, two unknown factors affect the expected \u03b3 sensitivity. First, since this is a multibody decay, the overlap between the interfering amplitudes is in general less than 100 %; this is accounted for by a coherence factor between zero and unity which enters the interference term in Eqs. (54), (55), (59), (60) as an unknown parameter. Second, the value of r B can be different from that in B \u2192 DK and is as yet unmeasured, although it is expected [318] that it can be larger in this decay than in B \u2192 DK. 2. B 0 \u2192 DK + \u03c0 \u2212 . Although the rate of these decays is smaller that of B + \u2192 DK + , both interfering amplitudes are colour-suppressed, therefore the expected value of r B is larger, r B 0.3. As a result, the sensitivity to \u03b3 should be similar to that in the B \u2192 DK modes. 52 Depending on the content of",

Measurement of \u03b3 from analysis of the \u039b 0 b \u2192 D\u039b decay mode was proposed in Ref. [400]. This method allows one to measure \u03b3 in a model-independent way by comparing the S-and P -wave amplitudes. However, this mode is problematic to reconstruct at LHCb because of the poorly defined \u039b 0 b vertex (both particles from its decay are long-lived) and low efficiency of \u039b reconstruction. Alternatively, one can consider a similar measurement with the decay \u039b 0 b \u2192 DpK \u2212 . A preliminary observation of this mode in early LHCb data has been reported [401]. Table 7 shows the expected sensitivity to \u03b3 from tree level decays in the upgrade scenario. The LHCb upgrade is the only proposed experiment which will be able to reach sub-degree precision on \u03b3 .",

However, the focus has been shifting to CP violation observables, which provide cleaner tests of the SM [406][407][408].

The CF decays, such as D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + , are mediated by tree amplitudes, and therefore no direct CP violation effects are expected. The same is true for DCS decays, such as D 0 \u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212 , even though these are much more rare. The SCS decays, on the other hand, can also have contributions from penguin amplitudes, and therefore direct CP violation is possible, even though the penguin contributions are expected to be small. Within this classification, it should be noted that some decays to final states containing K 0 S mesons, e.g. D 0 \u2192 K 0 S \u03c1 0 , have both CF and DCS contributions which can interfere [412].

However, when more data is accumulated-and certainly after the upgrade-it will be necessary to change the analysis to take second-order terms into account. This can be done using the ratio formulation of Eq. 87 The nuisance asymmetries A P and A D (\u03c0 + s ) cancel between the K + K \u2212 and \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 final states because these are properties of the D * + and of the tagging slow pion, respectively, which do not depend on the decay of the D 0 meson. However, an artificial correlation between these asymmetries and the decay mode can arise if the asymmetry varies as a function of some variable 63 (e.g. the momentum of the D * + ) and the reconstructed distributions in this variable are different for the K + K \u2212 and \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 final states (e.g. due to detector acceptance of the daughter tracks). In such a scenario, the two modes would populate regions with different raw asymmetries and so the nuisance asymmetries would not cancel fully. Two techniques have been used to address this:",

Only cases which lie within the narrow m(h + h \u2212 ) signal window will survive. This is more common for the K + K \u2212 final state than for \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 : the energy of a missing particle can be made up by misidentifying a pion as a kaon, but apart from D 0 \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 e + \u03bd e there is little that can fake the kinematics of D 0 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 . In practise, the charged hadron identification at LHCb suppresses these background greatly, and their raw asymmetries are not expected to be very different from the signal. In the published LHCb analysis, the impact of these backgrounds on the asymmetry was estimated by measuring their size and asymmetry in the h + h \u2212 mass sidebands and computing the effect of such a background on the signal with a toy Monte Carlo study. The alternative approach would be to use a full 2D fit to m(h + h \u2212 ) and \u03b4m, which would distinguish this class of peaking background from the signal by its m(h + h \u2212 ) distribution. The three issues discussed above-terms entering at second order in the asymmetries, non-cancellation due to kinematic correlations, and peaking backgrounds-are particular to this analysis and will require some changes to the procedure as larger data samples become available. In addition, there are more generic systematic uncertainties associated with the fit procedure and with the handling of events with more than one candidate.

This simple signal for NP was found to not be realised in nature, but it is interesting that the reverse relation, x D < y D with y D expected to be determined by the SM processes, might nevertheless significantly affect the sensitivity to NP of experimental analyses of D mixing [439]. Also, it is important to point out that, contrary to the calculations of the SM contribution to mixing, the contributions of NP models can be calculated relatively unambiguously [405,440,441].",

There are currently two approaches, neither of which give very reliable results because m c is in some sense intermediate between heavy and light. The \"inclusive\" approach is based on the OPE. In the m c \u039b QCD limit, where \u039b QCD is a scale characteristic of the strong interactions, m D and \u0393 D can be expanded in terms of matrix elements of local operators [434][435][436][437]. Such calculations typically yield x D , y D < 10 \u22123 . The use of the OPE relies on local quark-hadron duality (see, for example, Ref. [443]), and on \u039b QCD /E released (with E released \u223c m c ) being small enough to allow a truncation of the series. Moreover, a careful reorganisation of the OPE series is needed, as terms with smaller powers of m s are numerically more important despite being more suppressed by powers of 1/m c [434][435][436][437]. The numerically dominant contribution is composed of over twenty unknown matrix elements of dimension-12 operators, which are very hard to estimate. As a possible improvement of this approach, it would be important to perform lattice calculations of those matrix elements, as well as make perturbative QCD (pQCD) corrections to Wilson coefficients of those operators.",

Since there are cancellations between states within a given SU(3) f multiplet, one needs to know the contribution of each state with high precision. However, the D meson is not light enough that its decays are dominated by a few final states. In the absence of sufficiently precise data on many decay rates and on strong phases, one is forced to use some assumptions. While most studies find x D , y D < 10 \u22123 , Refs. [444][445][446][447][448][449] obtain x D and y D at the 10 \u22122 level by arguing that SU(3) f violation is of order unity. Particular care should be taken if experimental data are used to estimate the mixing parameters, as the large cancellations expected in the calculation make the final result sensitive to uncertainties in the experimental inputs. It was shown that phase space effects alone provide enough SU(3) f violation to induce x D , y D \u223c 10 \u22122 [442]. Large effects in y D appear for decays close to threshold, where an analytic expansion in SU(3) f violation is no longer possible; a dispersion relation can then be used to show that x D would receive contributions of similar order of magnitude. The dispersion calculation suffers from uncertainties associated with unknown (off-shell) q 2 -dependences of non-leptonic transition amplitudes and thus cannot be regarded as a precision calculation, although it provides a realistic estimate of x D . As a possible improvement of this approach, an estimate of SU(3) f breaking in matrix elements should be performed. In addition, a calculation with V ub = 0 should also be done, which is important to understand the size of CP violation in charm mixing.",

As an additional assumption, the framework can be aligned with the down sector, where the constraints are generically stronger. As in realistic alignment models (see e.g. Refs. [402,455]), the off-diagonal element ofm 2 Q in the down mass basis (which induces s \u2194 d FCNCs) is taken to be small but not zero, with comparable real and imaginary parts. For concreteness, values of either \u03bb 5 C or \u03bb 3 C (with \u03bb C being the Cabibbo angle) are examined, where in both cases the dominant bounds still arise from D 0 -D 0 mixing and not from the K system [454]. The constrained parameter is the squark mass degeneracy, defined by In order to analyze the effect of improving the experimental constraints on indirect CP violation in charm (assuming that no such violation is actually observed), for simplicity the bound on x 12 is kept fixed as in Eq. (98), while that on \u03c6 12 is varied. This is shown in Fig. 24 for the two alignment angles mentioned above and for two points in the SUSY parameter spacemQ = mg = 1 and 1.5 TeV, wheremQ is the average squark mass and mg is the gluino mass. The right edge of each of the four lines in the plots marks the current situation, where the dominant constraint is from m D . It is evident that after a certain level of improvement, the bound from CP violation becomes the important one, and this happens more quickly for a weaker alignment model (\u03bb 3 C ) than for \u03bb 5 C alignment. The reason is the larger phase in the former case.",

This is a particularly exciting possibility, given that reasonable NP models can be constructed in which all related flavour-changing neutral current (FCNC) constraints, e.g., from D 0 -D 0 mixing, 66 New results presented at ICHEP 2012, including a new result from Belle on A CP [423], are not included in the averages discussed here. are satisfied. A summary of NP interpretations is given in Sect. 4.4.1. First, a discussion of a dir CP in the SM is given. The naive expectation for the SM penguin-to-tree ratio is based on estimates of the \"short-distance\" penguins with b-quarks in the loops. In fact, there is consensus that a SM explanation for a dir CP would have to proceed via dynamical enhancement of the long-distance \"penguin contraction\" contributions to the penguin amplitudes, i.e., penguins with s and d quarks inside the \"loops\". Research addressing the direct CP asymmetry in the SM has largely fallen into one of two categories: (i) flavour SU(3) f or U-spin fits to the D decay rates, to check that an enhanced penguin amplitude can be accommodated [457][458][459][460][461][462][463] (this, by itself, would not mean that a dir CP is due to SM dynamics); (ii) rough estimates of the magnitudes of certain contributions to the long-distance penguin contractions [461,[464][465][466], to check if, in fact, it is reasonable that SM dynamics could yield the enhanced penguin amplitudes returned by the SU(3) f or U-spin fits.",

An SU(3) f analysis of the D \u2192 P P decay amplitudes that incorporates CP violation effects was first carried out about 20 years ago [445,457,467]. Already in this study the possibility of large direct CP asymmetries was anticipated, e.g., as large as the percent level assuming that the penguins receive a large enhancement akin to the I = 1/2 rule in kaon decays. An updated analysis, working to first order in SU(3) f breaking, has been presented [458], making use of branching ratio measurements for the D \u2192 K\u03c0, \u03c0\u03c0 and D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 K + , K 0 \u03b7 decay modes. The authors concluded that a dir CP can be easily reconciled with the measured branching ratios. This was also the conclusion of a study based on a diagrammatic SU(3) f amplitude decomposition [459], which considered a larger set of D \u2192 P P decay modes. Again, this is only a statement about the possibility of accommodating the required amplitudes in the flavour decomposition, not about their realisation via long distance QCD dynamics. Both studies observe that a SM explanation of a dir CP could be combined with precise measurements of the individual asymmetries",

The essential ingredients are: (i) 1/N c counting; (ii) D branching ratio data which shows that certain formally 1/m c power-suppressed amplitudes are of same order as their leading (1/m c ) 0 counterparts; (iii) translation of this breakdown of the 1/m c expansion to the penguin contraction amplitudes, in the approximation of a hard gluon exchange; (iv) use of a partonic quantity as a rough estimator of the hadronic interactions, e.g., final state interactions, underlying the penguin contraction \"loops\".

A fit of the CP-conserving contributions from the CP-averaged branching ratios provides information on the isospin amplitudes and the underlying renormalisation group invariant amplitude contributions.

Within the effective theory approach, this can be estimated via so-called \"weak mixing\" of the effective operators. In particular, time-ordered correlators of H eff-NP | C|=1 with the SM effective weak Hamiltonian can, at the one weak-loop order, induce important contributions to CP violation in both D meson mixing and kaon decays ( / ).

In the SM, large values of Y b,t induce a SU(3)/SU(2) flavour symmetry breaking pattern [451] which allows one to decompose X L under the residual SU(2) in a well defined way. Finally, residual SM SU(2) Q breaking is necessarily suppressed by small mass ratios m c,s /m t,b , and small CKM mixing angles. The most relevant implication of Eq. 107is that it predicts a direct correspondence between SU(3) Q breaking NP contributions to A CP and / [454]. It follows immediately that stringent limits on possible NP contributions to the latter require SU(3) Q breaking contributions to the former to be below the per mille level (for R NP,i = O(1)). As a corollary, one can show that within NP scenarios which only break SU(3) Q , existing stringent experimental bounds on new contributions to CP-violating rare semileptonic kaon decays K 0 L \u2192 \u03c0 0 (\u03bd\u03bd, + \u2212 ) put robust constraints on CP asymmetries of corresponding rare charm decays D \u2192 \u03c0(\u03bd\u03bd, + \u2212 ). In particular, the SU(3) Q -violating contribution to the CP asymmetry in D \u2192 \u03c0e + e \u2212 has been shown to be less than 2 % [454].",

If A CP is due to a chromomagnetic operator, i.e. due to I = 1/2 contributions, one can measure CP violation in radiative D decays, as explained in the previous section. Examples of NP models that can be tested in this way are, e.g., flavour-violating supersymmetric squark-gluino loops that mediate the c \u2192 ug transition [418,472,473]. On the other hand, if A CP is due to I = 3/2 NP one can use isospin symmetry to write sum rules for direct CP asymmetries in D decays [487]. If the sum rules are violated, then NP would be found. An example of a NP model that can be tested in this way is an addition of a single new scalar field with nontrivial flavour couplings [484]. The basic idea behind the I = 3/2 NP tests [487,488] is that in the SM the CP violation in SCS D decays arises from penguin amplitudes which are I = 1/2 transitions. On the other hand, I = 3/2 amplitudes are CP-conserving in the SM. Moreover, there are no I = 5/2 terms in the SM short-distance effective Hamiltonian, and though such contributions can be generated by electromagnetic rescattering (as has been discussed in the context of B \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0 decays [489,490]) they would also be CP conserving.

This is that, even when one has fixed the strong-interaction quantum numbers of a final state, say to I = S = 0, the strong interactions necessarily bring in multiple final states when E = m D . For example, \u03c0\u03c0 and KK states mix with \u03b7\u03b7, 4\u03c0 , 6\u03c0 , etc. The finite-volume states that are used by lattice QCD are inevitably mixtures of all these possibilities, and one must learn how, in principle and in practise, to disentangle these states so as to obtain the desired matrix element. Recently, in Ref. [500], a first step towards developing a complete method has been taken, in which the problem has been solved in principle for any number of two-particle channels, assuming that the scattering is dominantly S-wave. This is encouraging, and it may be that this method will allow semi-quantitative results for the amplitudes of interest to be obtained. Turning this method into practise is expected to take three to five years due to a number of numerical challenges (in particular the need to calculate several energy levels with good accuracy). It is also expected to be possible to generalise the methodology to include four particle states; several groups are actively working on the theoretical issues.

Therefore, aiming at a relative precision below 10 % and taking into account the current mixing parameter world averages, the target precision would be 2-3 \u00d7 10 \u22124 . Indirect CP violation is expected in the SM at the order of 10 \u22124 , and therefore the direct CP violation parameter contributing to A \u0393 has to be measured to a precision of 10 \u22123 in order to distinguish the two types of CP violation in A \u0393 .",

The results of this exercise are summarised in Table 10 for D 0 decays and in Table 11 for D + and D + s decays. Estimating the physics reach with the projected data sets requires a number of assumptions. The statistical precision generally improves as 1/ \u221a N . Estimating the systematic error, and therefore ultimate physics reach, is more of an art. It is often the case that data can be used to control systematic uncertainties at the level of the statistical error, but the extent to which this will be possible cannot be reliably predicted. In some cases controlling systematic uncertainties will require sacrificing some of the statistics to work with cleaner signals or with signals which populate only parts of the detector where the performance is very well understood.

An inclusive approach based on an operator product expansion relies on the expansion scale being small enough to allow convergence and furthermore involves the calculation of a large number of unknown matrix elements. An exclusive approach sums over intermediate hadronic states and requires very precise branching ratio determinations of these final states which are currently not available. Contrary to the SM, contributions beyond the SM can be calculated reliably. With the SM contribution to indirect CP violation being <10 \u22124 , the LHCb upgrade is ideally suited to cover the parameter space available for enhanced asymmetries beyond the SM. Measurements in several complementary modes will permit the extraction of the underlying theory parameters with high precision.",

            "text": "The mechanism of heavy quarkonium production is a longstanding problem in QCD. An effective field theory, nonrelativistic QCD (NRQCD), provides the foundation for much of the current theoretical work. According to NRQCD, the production of heavy quarkonium factorizes into two steps: a heavy quark-antiquark pair is first created perturbatively at short distances and subsequently evolves non-perturbatively into quarkonium at long distances. The NRQCD calculations depend on the colour-singlet (CS) and colour-octet (CO) matrix elements, which account for the probability of a heavy quark-antiquark pair in a particular colour state to evolve into heavy quarkonium. The CS model [512,513], which provides a leading-order (LO) description of quarkonia production, was first used to describe experimental data. However, it underestimates the observed crosssection for single J /\u03c8 production at high p T at the Tevatron [514]. To resolve this discrepancy the CO mechanism was introduced [515]. The corresponding matrix elements were determined from the large-p T data as the CO cross-section falls more slowly than that for CS. More recent higher-order calculations [516][517][518][519] close the gap between the CS predictions and the experimental data [520] reducing the need for large CO contributions. Traditionally, quarkonia production studies at hadron colliders have focussed on the study of J /\u03c8, \u03c8(2S) and \u03a5 (nS) decays to dimuon or dielectron pairs [520]. The LHCb programme so far has followed this pattern with measurements of many cross-sections already published [521][522][523][524][525]. As an example of the quality of the data, Fig. 25 shows the \u03a5 mass distribution. By the time of the upgrade in 2018, data samples corresponding to several fb \u22121 will have been collected at \u221a s = 7, 8 and 14 TeV and the results will be dominated by systematic uncertainties. Therefore, new probes of quarkonia production will be pursued. Two possibilities are detailed here: multiple quarkonia production and quarkonia production via hadronic decay modes. These studies will profit from the higher integrated luminosity and improved trigger. These modes provide clear signals in the detector and will be relatively uneffected by the increased pile-up.",

This new particle, referred to as the X(3872), was observed in B \u2192 X(3872)K decays, in the decay mode X(3872) \u2192 J /\u03c8\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and has a mass indistinguishable (within uncertainties) from the D * 0 D 0 threshold [520]. Several of the X(3872) parameters are unknown (such as its spin) or have large uncertainties, but this state does not match any predicted charmonium state [520]. The discovery of the X(3872) has led to a resurgence of interest in exotic spectroscopy and subsequently many new states have been claimed. For example: the Y family, Y (4260), Y (4320) and Y (4660), of spin parity 1 \u2212 , or the puzzling charged Z family, Z(4050) + , Z(4250) + and Z(4430) + , so far observed only by the Belle experiment [547][548][549], and not confirmed by BaBar [550,551]. The nature of these states has drawn much theoretical attention and many models have been proposed. One possible explanation is that they are bound molecular states of open charm mesons [552]. Another is that these are tetraquarks [553] states formed of four quarks (e.g. c,c, one light quark and one light anti-quark). Other interpretations have been postulated such as quark-gluon hybrid [553] or hadrocharmonium models [554], but experimental data are not yet able to conclude definitely. For reviews, see Refs. [520,552,[554][555][556][557][558].",

Several sources have been proposed in the literature: intrinsic charm [566], baryonium formation [567] and as yet unobserved exotic states [568]. One of the first proposed explanations for the excess was a contribution from an intrinsic charm component to the b-hadron wave-function [566]. This would lead to an enhancement of b-hadron decays to J /\u03c8 in association with open charm. The B-factories have set limits on such decays at the level of 10 \u22125 [190], which considerably restricts, but does not exclude, contributions from intrinsic charm models. The branching ratios of these decays have been estimated in pQCD [569]. In the case of B 0 \u2192 J /\u03c8D 0 the branching ratio has been estimated to be 7 \u00d7 10 \u22127 .

As the lowest bound state of two heavy quarks b and c, the B + c meson forms a unique flavoured, weakly decaying quarkonium system. Studies of the properties of B + c mesons such as the mass, lifetime and two-body non-leptonic decay modes are being performed with the current detector. As an example, Fig. 26 shows the signals observed for B + c \u2192 J /\u03c8\u03c0 + and B + c \u2192 J /\u03c83\u03c0 + . The large data set collected with the upgraded detector will allow these studies to be pursued with higher precision together with first studies of CP and triple-product asymmetries in the B + c system. In Table 15 the expected yields of selected decay modes are estimated extrapolating from the yields of B + c \u2192 J /\u03c8\u03c0 + and B + c \u2192 J /\u03c83\u03c0 + observed with the current detector. As well as studies of the branching ratios and searches for NP, these modes will allow precision measurements of the B + c Fig. 26 Invariant mass distribution of (top) B + c \u2192 J/\u03c83\u03c0 + and (bottom) B + c \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c0 + candidates using 0.8 fb \u22121 of integrated luminosity collected in 2011 [572].

However, the statistics may be marginal for follow-on analyses: measurements of the lifetime and ratios of branching fractions, searches for excited states, and so forth. They will certainly be insufficient for angular analyses aimed at confirming the quark model predictions for the spin-parity of these states. These studies will require the statistics and improved triggering of the LHCb upgrade. Heavier states such as the \u03a9 cc , \u039e bc , and \u039e bb have still smaller production cross-sections [585]. First studies towards \u039e bc detection are in progress.

The forward coverage of LHCb also allows a probe of electroweak boson production in a different regime from that of ATLAS and CMS, and the range of accessible physics topics is not limited to electroweak bosons. For example, tt production proceeds predominantly by gluon-gluon fusion in the central region, but has a significant contribution from quark-antiquark annihilation in the forward region, giving a similar production regime to that studied at the Tevatron.",

The raw value of A FB measured in dimuon final states at the LHC is about five times larger than at an e + e \u2212 collider, due to the initial state couplings, and so, in principle, it can be measured with a better relative precision, given equal amounts of data. The measurement however requires knowledge of the direction of the quark and antiquark that created the Z boson, and any uncertainty in this quantity results in a dilution of the observed value of A FB . This dilution is very significant in the central region, as there is an approximately equal probability for each proton to contain the quark or anti-quark that is involved in the creation of the Z, leading to an ambiguity in the definition of the axis required in the measurement. However, the more forward the Z boson is produced, the more likely it is that it follows the quark direction; for rapidities y > 3, the Z follows the quark direction in around 95 % of the cases. Furthermore, in the forward region, the partonic collisions that produce the Z are nearly always between u-valence and\u016b-sea quark or d-valence andd-sea quark. The ss contribution, with a less well-known parton density function, is smaller than in the central region. Consequently, the forward region is the optimum environment in which to measure A FB at the LHC. Preliminary studies [586] have shown that with a 50 fb \u22121 data sample collected by the LHCb upgrade, A FB could be  [587]. LHCb will be able to bring clarity to this unsatisfactory situation.",

Although no studies have yet been made of determining m W with LHCb itself, it is evident that the experiment can give important input to the measurements being made at ATLAS and CMS [591]. A significant and potentially limiting external uncertainty on m W will again come from the knowledge of the parton density functions. These are less constrained in the kinematic range accessible to LHCb, so that precise measurements of W + , W \u2212 , Z and Drell-Yan production in this region can be used to improve the global picture. Improved determinations of the shapes of the differential cross-sections are particularly important. One specific area of concern arises from the knowledge of the heavy quarks in the proton. Around 20-30 % of W production in the central region is expected to involve s and c quarks, making the understanding of this component very important for the m W measurement. LHCb can make a unique contribution to improving the knowledge of the heavy-quark parton density functions by exploiting its vertexing and particle identification capabilities to tag the relatively low-p T final-state quarks produced in processes such as gs \u2192 W c, gc \u2192 Zc, gb \u2192 Zb, gc \u2192 \u03b3 c and gb \u2192 \u03b3 b. These processes provide direct probes of the strange, charm and bottom partons, and can be probed at high and low values of Bjorken x inside the LHCb acceptance.",

The LHCb acceptance for identifying both leptons from tt decays is far smaller than that of ATLAS and CMS (typically 2 % rather than 70 %, according to PYTHIA generator level studies). However, the higher qq production fraction and better determined direction in the LHCb forward acceptance combine to suggest that competitive measurements can be achieved.

Strassler and Zurek [601] suggest that an exotic Higgs boson could decay with a significant branching fraction to a pair of \u03c0 0 v particles, where the \u03c0 0 v is the 'neutral' member of the isotriplet of v-isospin 1 hadrons formed by U and C quarks. The \u03c0 0 v can decay in SM particles and if the mass of the spinless \u03c0 0 v is below the ZZ threshold it will decay dominantly into bb pairs due to helicity conservation. Here the \u03c0 0 v widths are determined by their lifetime which could be very long, resulting in narrow states. The final state would consist of four b-jets, each pair being produced from a displaced vertex corresponding to the \u03c0 0 v decay as illustrated in Fig. 29. If these decays exist, the lower limit on the Higgs mass set by LEP would be misleading, as it assumes the prompt decay of the Higgs to bb to be dominant. During 2010 and 2011 data taking, an inclusive displaced vertex trigger has been introduced in the second level of the software trigger. Preliminary studies [605] have demonstrated that for an output rate below 1 % of the overall trigger bandwidth, the efficiency of the whole trigger chain on events with two offline reconstructible \u03c0 0 v vertices with a minimum mass of 6 GeV and good vertex quality is of the order of 80 %. This strategy has been tested up to on average two visible interactions per crossing which is what is expected for the upgraded experiment.",

With the present detector, it is difficult to keep the trigger rate down for single candidate events without using tight cuts on the mass and the displacement of the candidates. In the previous model, the trigger efficiency for events with a single long-lived particle reconstructible in LHCb is only about 20 %. This efficiency is expected to decrease for models where the mass of the long-lived particle is smaller. In addition, the number of events with at least one \u03c0 0 v state in the acceptance is three times higher than the number of events with two \u03c0 0 v particles.

The blue dashed line shows a simulation of a model with baryon number violating neutralino couplings the use of an improved description for the complex RF foil shape will give a better control on the background arising from hadronic interactions.

At high energies the t-channel exchanges giving rise to these processes can only be zero-charge colour singlets. Known exchanges include the photon and the pomeron. Another possibility, allowed in QCD, but not yet observed, is the odderon, a negative C-parity partner to the pomeron with at least three gluons.

The full analysis will allow determination of numerous NP-sensitive observables (see, for example, Refs. [53,54]). The measurements that will be obtained from such an analysis, as well as similar studies of related channels, such as B 0 s \u2192 \u03c6\u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 [69], allow model-independent constraints on NP, manifested as limits on the operators of the effective Hamiltonian (see, for example, Refs. [42,43]). Indeed, the first results already impose important constraints. Studies of radiative decays such as B 0 s \u2192 \u03c6\u03b3 [16,17] provide additional information since they allow to measure the polarisation of the emitted photon, and are therefore especially sensitive to models that predict new right-handed currents. Similarly, studies of observables such as isospin asymmetries [77] are important since they allow to pin down in which operators the NP effects occur.",

Effects of O(0.1) are typical of some wellmotivated NP models that survive the present ATLAS and CMS bounds (such as in Ref. [37]). The experimental uncertainty on \u03c6 s is still a factor of 40 larger than that on the prediction, therefore improved measurements are needed to reach the level of sensitivity demanded by theory.

Further measurements are needed in order to establish if NP effects are present in the charm sector. Among the anticipated results are updates of the A CP measurement as well as of the individual CP asymmetries in D 0 \u2192 K + K \u2212 and D 0 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 . It is of great interest to look for direct CP violation in decays to other final states, and in decays of other charmed hadrons (D + , D + s and \u039b + c ). The SM predictions are somewhat cleaner for indirect CP violation effects, and therefore it is also essential to search for CP violation in charm mixing. New results from time-dependent analyses of D 0 \u2192 K + K \u2212 [19] and D 0 \u2192 K 0 S \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 will improve the current knowledge, and additional channels will also be important with high statistics.",

Conventional hadrons can also be studied with high precision: one important goal will be to establish the existence of doubly heavy baryons. Central exclusive production of conventional and exotic hadrons can also be studied; the sensitivity of the upgraded experiment will be significantly enhanced due to the software trigger. Measurements of production rates and asymmetries of electroweak gauge bosons in the LHCb acceptance are important to constrain parton density functions [588]. With high statistics, LHCb will be well placed to make a precision measurement of the sine of the effective electroweak mixing angle for leptons, sin 2 \u03b8 lept eff , from the forward-backward asymmetry of leptons produced in the Z \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 decay. Improved knowledge of parton density functions, as can be obtained from studies of production of gauge bosons in association with jets [617], will help to reduce limiting uncertainties on the measurement of the W boson. These studies are also an important step towards a top physics programme at LHCb, which will become possible once the LHC energy approaches the nominal 14 TeV.",

In particular, at the observed mass the highest branching ratio is expected to be for H \u2192 bb-however this is a difficult channel for ATLAS and CMS due to the large SM background. LHCb with its excellent b-hadron sensitivity will be able to search for such decays. The forward geometry of LHCb is also advantageous to observe new long-lived particles that are predicted in certain NP models, including some with extended Higgs sectors. Although limits can be set with the current detector [605], this is an area that benefits significantly from the flexible software trigger of the upgraded experiment. Models with extended Higgs sectors also produce characteristic signals in flavour physics observables, which emphasises the need for the LHCb upgrade as part of the full exploitation of the LHC.",

            "text": "As mentioned in Sect. 1, the LHCb upgrade is necessary to progress beyond the limitations imposed by the current hardware trigger that, due to its maximum output rate of 1 MHz, restricts the instantaneous luminosity at which data can most effectively be collected. To overcome this, the upgraded detector will be read out at the maximum LHC bunch-crossing frequency of 40 MHz so that the trigger can be fully implemented in software. The upgraded detector will be installed during the long shutdown of the LHC planned for 2018. A detailed description of the upgraded LHCb experiment can be found in the Letter of Intent (LoI) [25], complemented by the recent framework technical design report (FTDR) [26], which sets out the timeline and costing for the project. A summary has been prepared for the European Strategy Preparatory Group [618]. The sensitivity to various flavour observables is summarised in Table 16, which is taken from the FTDR [26]. This is an updated version of a similar summary that appears as Table 2.1 in the LoI [25]. The measurements considered include CP-violating observables, rare decays and fundamental parameters of the CKM unitarity triangle. More details about these observables are given below. The current precision, either from LHCb measurements or averaging groups [44,252,266], is given and compared to the estimated sensitivity with the upgrade. As an intermediate step, the estimated precision that can be achieved prior to the upgrade is also given for each observable. For this, a total integrated luminosity of 1.0 (1.5, 4.0) fb \u22121 at pp centre-ofmass collision energy \u221a s = 7 (8,13) TeV recorded in 2011 (2012, 2015-2017) is assumed. Another assumption is that the current efficiency of the muon hardware trigger can be maintained at higher \u221a s, but that higher thresholds will be necessary for other triggers, reducing the efficiency for the relevant channels by a factor of 2 at \u221a s = 14 TeV. In LHCb measurements to date, the CP-violating phase in B 0 s mixing, measured in both J /\u03c8\u03c6 and J /\u03c8f 0 (980) final states, has been denoted \u03c6 s . In the upgrade era it will be necessary to remove some of the assumptions that have been made in the analyses to date, related to possible penguin amplitude contributions, and therefore the observables in b \u2192 ccs transitions are denoted by 2\u03b2 s = \u2212\u03c6 s , while in b \u2192 qqs (q = u, d, s) transitions the notation 2\u03b2 eff s is used. This parallels the established notation used in the B 0 system (the \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 convention for the CKM unitarity triangle angles is used). The penguin contributions are expected to be small, and therefore a theory uncertainty on 2\u03b2 s (B 0 s \u2192 J /\u03c8\u03c6) \u223c 0.003 is quoted, comparable to the theory uncertainty on 2\u03b2(B 0 \u2192 J /\u03c8K 0 S ). However, larger effects cannot be ruled out at present. Data-driven methods to determine the penguin amplitudes are also possible [246,277,284]: at present these given much larger estimates of the uncertainty, but improvement can be anticipated with increasing data samples. The flavour-specific asymmetry in the B 0 s system, a s sl in Table 16, probes CP violation in mix-ing. The \"sl\" subscript is used because the measurement uses semileptonic decays. Sensitivity to the emitted photon polarisation is encoded in the effective lifetime, \u03c4 eff of B 0 s \u2192 \u03c6\u03b3 decays, together with the effective CP-violation parameter 2\u03b2 eff s . Two of the most interesting of the full set of angular observables in B 0 \u2192 K * 0 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 decays [62], are S 3 , which is related to the transverse polarisation asymmetry [63], and the zerocrossing point (s 0 ) of the forward-backward asymmetry. As discussed above, isospin asymmetries, denoted A I , are also of great interest.",

While the sensitivities given include statistical uncertainties only, preliminary studies of systematic effects suggest that these will not affect the conclusions significantly, except in the most precise measurements, such as those of a s sl , A \u0393 and A CP . Branching fraction measurements of B 0 s mesons require knowledge of the ratio of fragmentation fractions f s /f d for normalisation [145]. The uncertainty on this quantity is limited by knowledge of the branching fraction of D + s \u2192 K + K \u2212 \u03c0 + , and improved measurements of this quantity will be necessary to avoid a limiting uncertainty on, for example, B(B 0 s \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 ). The determination of 2\u03b2 s from B 0 s \u2192 J /\u03c8\u03c6 provides an example of how systematic uncertainties can be controlled for measurements at the LHCb upgrade. In the most recent measurement [139], the largest source of systematic uncertainty arises due to the constraint of no direct CP violation that is imposed in the fit. With larger statistics, this constraint can be removed, eliminating this source of uncertainty. Other sources, such as the background description and angular acceptance, are already at the 0.01 rad level, and can be reduced with more detailed studies.",

Similarly the yields in charmed-particle decays to final states consisting of only charged tracks cannot be matched by any other experiment. On the other hand, the e + e \u2212 environment is advantageous for inclusive studies and for measurements of decay modes including multiple neutral particles [619][620][621][622][623], and therefore enables complementary measurements to those that will be made with the upgraded LHCb experiment.",

            "text": ", additional sources of CP violation are required. Many extensions of the SM naturally contain new sources of CP violation. The b hadron systems provide excellent laboratories to search for new sources of CP violation, since new particles beyond the SM may enter loop-mediated processes such as b \u2192 q FCNC transitions with q = s or d, leading to discrepancies between measurements of CP asymmetries and their SM expectations. Two types of b \u2192 q FCNC transitions are of special interest: neutral B meson mixing ( B = 2) processes, and loop-mediated B decay ( B = 1) processes. The LHCb experiment exploits the large number of b hadrons, including the particularly interesting B 0 s mesons, produced in proton-proton collisions at the LHC to search for CP-violating NP effects. Section 3.2 provides a review of the status and prospects in the area of searches for NP in B 0 (s) mixing, in particular through measurements of the mixing phases \u03c6 d(s) and the semileptonic asymmetries a d(s) sl . The LHCb efforts to search for NP in hadronic b \u2192 s penguin decays, such as B 0 s \u2192 \u03c6\u03c6, are discussed in Sect. 3.3. Section 3.4 describes the LHCb programme to measure the angle \u03b3 of the CKM unitarity triangle (UT) in decay processes described only by tree amplitudes, such as B \u00b1 \u2192 DK \u00b1 , B 0 \u2192 DK * 0 and B 0 s \u2192 D \u2213 s K \u00b1 . These measurements allow precise tests of the SM description of quark-mixing via global fits to the parameters of the CKM matrix, as well as direct comparisons with alternative determinations of \u03b3 in decay processes involving loop diagrams, such as B 0 s \u2192 K + K \u2212 . At the end of each section, a brief summary of the most promising measurements with the upgraded LHCb detector and their expected/projected sensitivities is provided.",
