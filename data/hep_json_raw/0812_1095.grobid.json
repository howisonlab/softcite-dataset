In this method, the doubly tagged \u03c8(3770) \u2192 D 0 D 0 events, with one D decays to CP -eigenstates and the other D decays semileptonically, are used to reconstruct the signals. Since this analysis requires good e/\u03c0 separation, a likelihood approach, which combines the dE/dx, time of flight and the electromagnetic shower detectors information, is used for particle identification. We estimate the sensitivity of the measurement of y to be 0.007 based on a 20f b \u22121 fully simulated MC sample.",

            "text": "The mixing between a particle and its antiparticle has been observed experimentally in neutral K, B d and B s system. In the Standard Model, however, the mixing rate of the neutral D system is expected in general to be small and long-distance contributions make it difficult to be calculated [1,2,3,4] . Recently, several measurements [5,6,7,8,9] present evidences for D 0 \u2212D 0 mixing with the significance ranging from 3 to 4 standard deviations. This highlights the need for independent measurements of the mixing parameters. Here, we present a study on measuring the mixing parameter y at BESIII experiment, which takes advantage of the correlated threshold production of D 0 \u2212D 0 pairs in e + e \u2212 collisions.",

Other attempts [5,6,7,8,9] are based on the proper-time measurements of the neutral D meason decays. However, the time-dependent analyse are not possible at symmetric charm factory, which operates at the \u03c8(3770) resonance. In this analysis, we utilize the quantum-coherent threshold production of D 0 \u2212 D 0 pairs in a state of definite C = \u22121. Applying the kinematics of the process of e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c8(3770) \u2192 D 0D0 , we can reconstruct both neutral D mesons (double tagging (DT) technique) to obtain clean samples to measure the mixing parameters, the strong phase difference and the CP violation.

In the e-ID, we implement the artificial neural network (ANN) [26] to provide a general framework for estimating non-linear functional mapping between the input variables and the output variable. For the neural network (NN) training, we use the momentum, traverse momentum and other six discriminants (total deposit energy, Eseed, E3x3, E5x5, second moment and \u2206\u03c6) as the input variables. The network we choose has one hidden layer with 16 neurons and one output value. Figure. 4 shows the two-dimension distributions of the output value versus the momentum of the electrons and pions. It is obvious that the distribution of the output value depends on the momentum, especially at low momentum region. Thus, it is unsuitable to apply a single cut on the output value to separate the electrons from the pions. In practice, we construct probability density function (PDF) of the NN output value at every 0.1 GeV/c momentum bin. The PDF is obtained from fitting the nearest 4 bins of the NN output value, with the third-order polynomial function. Then, the PDF value of the NN output can be extracted from the fit. Finally, we make the PID decision by comparing the likelihood values of electron and pion hypothesis. ",

Based on a 20f b \u22121 fully simulated MC sample of \u03c8(3770) resonance decays, we estimated the sensitivity of the y measurement to be 0.007. In this analysis, the double tagging technique was used for reconstructing the D meson pairs. Here, the signal is reconstructed such that one D decays to CP eigenstates and the other D decays semileptonically. The electron identification is essential for this analysis. We improved the e-ID technique for BESIII experiment, which can also be applied to many other important physics topics. Our next step is to include more semileptonic decay modes, such as D 0 \u2192 K * e\u03bd e , into this analysis to improve the sensitivity of y measurement.",

In the Standard Model, however, the mixing rate of the neutral D system is expected in general to be small and long-distance contributions make it difficult to be calculated [1,2,3,4] . Recently, several measurements [5,6,7,8,9] present evidences for D 0 \u2212D 0 mixing with the significance ranging from 3 to 4 standard deviations. This highlights the need for independent measurements of the mixing parameters. Here, we present a study on measuring the mixing parameter y at BESIII experiment, which takes advantage of the correlated threshold production of D 0 \u2212D 0 pairs in e + e \u2212 collisions.",

In the e-ID, we implement the artificial neural network (ANN) [26] to provide a general framework for estimating non-linear functional mapping between the input variables and the output variable. For the neural network (NN) training, we use the momentum, traverse momentum and other six discriminants (total deposit energy, Eseed, E3x3, E5x5, second moment and \u2206\u03c6) as the input variables. The network we choose has one hidden layer with 16 neurons and one output value. Figure. 4 shows the two-dimension distributions of the output value versus the momentum of the electrons and pions. It is obvious that the distribution of the output value depends on the momentum, especially at low momentum region. Thus, it is unsuitable to apply a single cut on the output value to separate the electrons from the pions. In practice, we construct probability density function (PDF) of the NN output value at every 0.1 GeV/c momentum bin. The PDF is obtained from fitting the nearest 4 bins of the NN output value, with the third-order polynomial function. Then, the PDF value of the NN output can be extracted from the fit. Finally, we make the PID decision by comparing the likelihood values of electron and pion hypothesis. ",

Moreover, the two tracks need to pass a common vertex constraint.

In this analysis, the double tagging technique was used for reconstructing the D meson pairs. Here, the signal is reconstructed such that one D decays to CP eigenstates and the other D decays semileptonically. The electron identification is essential for this analysis. We improved the e-ID technique for BESIII experiment, which can also be applied to many other important physics topics. Our next step is to include more semileptonic decay modes, such as D 0 \u2192 K * e\u03bd e , into this analysis to improve the sensitivity of y measurement.",
