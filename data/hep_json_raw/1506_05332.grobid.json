These particles, if produced at the Large Hadron Collider, should be moving non-relativistically and are therefore identifiable through the measurement of an anomalously large specific energy loss in the ATLAS pixel detector. Measuring heavy long-lived particles through their track parameters in the vicinity of the interaction vertex provides sensitivity to metastable particles with lifetimes from 0.6 ns to 30 ns. A search for such particles with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider is presented, based on a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 18.4 fb \u22121 of pp collisions at \u221a s = 8 TeV. No significant deviation from the Standard Model background expectation is observed, and lifetime-dependent upper limits on Rhadrons and chargino production are set. Gluino R-hadrons with 10 ns lifetime and masses up to 1185 GeV are excluded at 95 % confidence level, and so are charginos with 15 ns lifetime and masses up to 482 GeV. ation of the LHC, as well as the support staff from our institutions without whom ATLAS could not be operated efficiently.

Hadronising LLPs are anticipated in a wide range of physics models that extend the Standard Model (SM). For example, these particles appear in both R-parity-conserving [2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9] and R-parity-violating [10][11][12] supersymmetry (SUSY) and in universal extra dimensions theories [13,14]. e-mail: atlas.publications@cern.ch These particles can be stable, or metastable; 1 the lifetime of these metastable particles may depend on the mass splitting with the lightest SUSY particle or on the size of any R-parity-violating coupling [15].",

The ATLAS detector [16] has a number of subsystems able to measure the velocity of charged particles. The pixel detector [17] provides measurements of ionisation energy loss (dE/dx) whereas the calorimeters and the muon spectrometer give a direct measurement of the time of flight for particles traversing them. A search for stable LLPs has been performed with the ATLAS detector [18] with 4.7 fb \u22121 of \u221a s = 7 TeV proton-proton ( pp) collisions using both the full detector information as well as the pixel detector information alone, and has been recently updated with the entire \u221a s = 8 TeV dataset [19], but without a pixel-only analysis. The CMS Collaboration has recently published [20] an analysis searching for stable LLPs based on the measurement of dE/dx, \u03b2, and on muon identification. In CMS, a search for metastable LLPs has been carried out by looking for secondary vertices [21], or disappearing tracks [22]. A displaced vertex search performed by the ATLAS Collaboration [23] sets limits on metastable particles in a number of scenarios. Limits on chargino production, from an analysis searching for disappearing tracks, have also been published by the ATLAS Collaboration [24].",

This measurement does not depend on the way the LLP interacts in the dense calorimeter material nor, to a first approximation, on the LLP decay mode. It can therefore address many different models of New Physics, especially those predicting the production of metastable heavy particles with O(ns) lifetime at LHC energies, such as mini-split SUSY [25,26] or anomaly-mediated supersymmetry breaking (AMSB) models [27,28]. A metastable gluino with a mass of 1 TeV would be compatible with the measured Higgs boson mass according to mini-split SUSY models, which also predict squark masses of 10 3 -10 5 TeV, therefore making the gluino the only observable strongly produced SUSY particle at LHC energies. In AMSB models, SUSY breaking is caused by loop effects and the lightest chargino can be only slightly heavier than the lightest neutralino, resulting in a heavy charged particle that can be measured before decaying into very low energy SM particles and a neutralino.",

This is the only model where doubly charged R-hadrons are predicted, with a production probability of 0.1 %. Hadronic scattering is described through a purely phase-space-driven approach. A second model, referred to as the Regge model in the following, employs a triple-Regge formalism to describe hadronic scattering and describes R-hadrons containing gluinos according to Ref. [48]. More recent models for the hadronic scattering of gluino R-hadrons predict that the majority would be electrically neutral after just a few hadronic interactions. The third scenario considered here belongs to this family and is based on bag-model calculations presented in Ref. [49]. This is referred to as the intermediate model. The probability for a gluino to form a gluon-gluino bound state, based on a colouroctet model, is assumed to be 10 % [2]. Results are presented for the generic (Regge) model for gluino (squark) R-hadrons.

In the case of metastable Rhadrons, the E miss T also depends on the mass of the neutralino produced in the decay itself. The two R-hadrons tend to be emitted back-to-back and the same holds for the two heavy neutralinos, which therefore approximately balance E miss T . If neutralinos are light, highp T jets coming from R-hadron  Fig. 2 Efficiency for the calorimetric E miss T > 80 GeV trigger as a function of the R-hadron mass or of the chargino mass. Separate curves are also shown for the stable and metastable cases. Only statistical uncertainties are shown, which are too small to be visible on these graphs decay also contribute to the transverse momentum imbalance. For this reason, the calorimetric E miss T is significantly larger when the neutralino is light. The E miss T also depends on the lifetime of the parent particle as this defines the fraction that decay before the calorimeter and therefore affects E miss T . If the lifetime is shorter than 1 ns, the decay happens very close to the primary vertex and the calorimetric E miss T does not depend very much on the lifetime. On the other hand, if the lifetime is long enough, the decay may happen beyond the calorimeter region and, therefore, the calorimetric E miss T is close to the stable case. The 10 ns lifetime is an intermediate case, as decays happen mainly, but not exclusively, in the tracker region.",

This uncertainty is large for the benchmark channels in which the E miss T is dominated by the ISR contribution, such as the stable Rhadrons or the gluino R-hadrons decaying into g/qq plus a heavy neutralino of mass m(\u03c7 0 1 ) = m(g) \u2212 100 GeV. The  uncertainty on QCD radiation is evaluated for metastable charginos using the same procedure as described in Ref. [24], while for stable charginos the same uncertainty used for the stable R-hadrons is used, as the E miss T distributions are very similar. For the R-hadrons there is an uncertainty on how they interact with the detector material, and this is evaluated by comparing the efficiencies obtained from generating events according to the three scattering models described in Sect. 4.1. Efficiencies for chargino events generated with and without the jet filter (see Sect. 4.4) are compared, and their difference is accounted for as a systematic uncertainty. A systematic uncertainty is assigned to the lifetime reweighting procedure, and is estimated as the discrepancy between the efficiencies obtained for the same reweighted lifetime starting from different samples.  The systematic uncertainties on the detector modelling are dominated by the trigger efficiency modelling, by the E miss T scale, and by the parameterisation of the ionisation. Systematic uncertainties related to the trigger are evaluated by varying the threshold and resolution parameters of the calorimetric E miss T trigger efficiency modelling curve and then looking at the efficiency difference between data and MC simulated Z \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 events. Systematic uncertainties of the E miss T measurement are evaluated with the methods described in Refs. [57,63] and are propagated to the uncertainty of the efficiency. Since the pile-up distribution is different in data and MC simulation, the simulated samples are reweighted to match the data, and a systematic uncertainty is calculated by varying the weighting factors. The systematic uncertainty on the pixel ionisation is evaluated by compar-  Fig. 10 Upper limits on the production cross section as a function of mass for metastable charginos, with lifetime \u03c4 = 1.0 ns, decaying int\u00f5 \u03c7 0",

The search uses 18.4 fb \u22121 of pp collision data at \u221a s = 8 TeV collected by the ATLAS detector at the LHC. In the scenario considered, stable charginos with masses smaller than 534 GeV are excluded at 95 % confidence level, and so are stable R-hadrons with masses smaller than 1115 GeV for gluinos, 751 GeV for bottom squarks and 766 GeV for top squarks. For metastable particles the maximum sensitivity is reached at 10 ns lifetime for R-hadrons, where masses below 1185 GeV are excluded, and at 15 ns lifetime for charginos, where masses up to 482 GeV are excluded. Compared to previous searches this search provides the best sensitivity for gluinos with lifetimes between 3 and 20 ns.",
