            "text": "A measurement of the electroproduction of photons off protons in the deeply inelastic regime was performed at Jefferson Lab using a nearly 6-GeV electron beam, a longitudinally polarized proton target and the CEBAF Large Acceptance Spectrometer. Target-spin asymmetries for ep \u2192 e p \u03b3 events, which arise from the interference of the deeply virtual Compton scattering and the Bethe-Heitler processes, were extracted over the widest kinematics in Q 2 , xB, t and \u03c6, for 166 fourdimensional bins. In the framework of Generalized Parton Distributions (GPDs), at leading twist the t dependence of these asymmetries provides insight on the spatial distribution of the axial charge of the proton, which appears to be concentrated in its center. These results also bring important and necessary constraints for the existing parametrizations of chiral-even GPDs. Nearly 60 years after Hofstadter's direct measurement of the finite size of the proton [1], the way the bulk properties of the nucleon, such as its mass and spin, are connected to the dynamics of its constituents is still a subject of intense research. Quantum Chromo-Dynamics (QCD), the fundamental theory of the strong interaction, is still unsolved for quarks confined in the nucleon. Therefore, phenomenological functions need to be used to connect experimental observables with the inner dynamics of the constituents of the nucleons, the partons. The Generalized Parton Distributions (GPDs) have emerged two decades ago as a universal tool to describe hadrons, and nucleons in particular, in terms of their elementary constituents, quarks and gluons [2][3][4][5][6][7]. The GPDs combine and generalize the features of the form factors measured in elastic scattering and of the parton distribution functions obtained via deep inelastic scattering (DIS). In a reference frame in which the nucleon moves at the speed of light, the GPDs correlate the longitudinal momentum and the transverse position of partons in a given helicity state. They can also give access to the contribution to the nucleon spin from the orbital angular momentum of the quarks, via Ji's sum rule [4]. At leading order in the QCD coupling constant \u03b1 s and at leading twist (i.e. neglecting quark-gluon interactions or higher-order quark loops), considering only quark GPDs and quark-helicity conserving quantities, there are four different GPDs for the nucleon: H, E, H, E, which can be measured in exclusive electroproduction reactions at high electron- * corresponding author: silvia@jlab.org \u2020 Current address:University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky 40506 \u2021 Current address:Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility, Newport News, Virginia 23606 \u00a7 Current address:University of Massachusetts, Amherst, Massachusetts 01003 \u00b6 Current address:University of Connecticut, Storrs, Connecticut 06269 * * Current address:Old Dominion University, Norfolk, Virginia 23529",

The struck quark emits a real photon, as a result of which its final longitudinal momentum fraction is (x \u2212 \u03be). The amplitude for DVCS can be factorized [4] into a hardscattering part (calculable in perturbative QCD) and a non-perturbative part, encoding the soft structure of the nucleon, parametrized by the GPDs. The GPDs depend on the three kinematic variables x, \u03be, and t, which are defined in the caption of Fig. 1.

At the cross-section level BH is typically larger than DVCS, but information on the latter can be obtained by extracting the DVCS/BH interference term, and exploiting the fact that the amplitude of BH can be accurately computed. It was shown [7] that a spin-dependent asymmetry, with respect to the spin of either the incoming electron or the target nucleon, of the ep \u2192 e p \u03b3 reaction at leading twist depends mainly on the DVCS/BH interference. Such spin asymmetries can then be connected to combinations of real and imaginary parts of Compton Form Factors (CFFs), defined as [6] ",

High-statistics and wide-coverage beam-spin asymmetries measured in Hall B with CLAS [12] brought important constraints for the parametrization of the GPD H.

Figure 2 shows, as examples, the effect of the cuts on the missing mass of X in ep \u2192 e p X (left) and on \u2206\u03c6 (right). The gray and black shaded areas represent the events after all exclusivity cuts but the one on the plotted variable were applied for the 14 NH 3 and 12 C data, respectively. The black shaded areas, in particular, show how the cuts drastically reduce the effect  of the nuclear background from 14 N. The remaining 14 N contamination was evaluated using a dilution factor accounting for the fraction of e p \u03b3 events originating from the polarized hydrogen relative to the total number of e p \u03b3 events from all materials in the target. This factor was determined using data taken on 14 NH 3 and on 12 C targets, each normalized by the accumulated charge and corrected for the different areal densities of the target materials. The resulting dilution factor (D f = 0.923\u00b10.007) was applied to the final asymmetry as in Eq. 3 below.",

Fits were also done, where the statistics allowed, adding an extra sin 2\u03c6 term to the numerator. This term turned out to be negligible compared to the sin \u03c6 term, gaining strength in the low-Q 2 kinematics as \u2212t increased. Interpreted in the GPD framework, this result points towards the dominance of the leading-twist handbag process of Fig. 1 over highertwist diagrams. The \u2212t dependence of the A UL fit parameter \u03b1 for each bin in Q 2 -x B is shown in Fig. 4, panels 1-5. The trend of the target-spin asymmetry as a function of \u2212t is quite different from what was observed for the beam-spin asymmetry [12], which displayed a much stronger drop, by about a factor of 3 on average, for all Q 2 -x B kinematics but more markedly at low x B . It must be recalled that the DVCS/BH beam-spin and targetspin asymmetries are mostly sensitive to the GPDs H and to a combination ofH and H, respectively. Therefore, considering that the t-slope of the GPDs is linked via a Fourier-like transform to the transverse position of the struck parton [20], this result suggests that the axial charge (linked to mH) is more concentrated in the center of the nucleon than the electric charge (linked to (Color online) Target-spin asymmetry (AUL) for DVCS/BH events as a function of \u03c6 for each threedimensional bin in Q 2 -xB (rows) and \u2212t (columns -the bin limits are shown on the top axis). The shaded bands are the systematic uncertainties. The thin black line is the fit to AUL with the function \u03b1 sin \u03c6 1+\u03b2 cos \u03c6 (for all bins but those marked with ( * ), which were fitted with \u03b1 sin \u03c6 due to the limited \u03c6 coverage). The dashed/red lines are the predictions of the VGG model [22]. mH), confirming what was first observed in [21]. This is in agreement with the behavior as a function of Q 2 of the axial form factor, which is the first moment in x of H, and which was measured in \u03c0 + electroproduction experiments on the proton as well as in neutrino-nucleon scattering [23]. Our result adds to this the extra information on the longitudinal momentum of the partons.",

Both the VGG and GK models are based on double distributions [2,27] to parametrize the (x, \u03be) dependence of the GPDs, and on Regge phenomenology for their t depen- dence. The main differences between these two models are in the parametrization of the high-t part of the electromagnetic form factors and in the fact that the parameters of GK are tuned using low-x B deeply-virtual meson production data from HERA. KMM12 is a hybrid model designed for global fitting, in which sea-quark GPDs are represented as infinite sums of t-channel exchanges; valence quarks are modeled in terms of these GPDs on the line \u03be = x. The parameters of KMM12 were fixed using polarized-and unpolarized-proton DVCS data from HERMES [14,28]. The range of applicability of this model is defined by the relation \u2212t < Q 2 4 . The GGL model provides a diquark-model parametrization of the GPDs with Regge behavior for the t dependence. The parameters of GGL were obtained by fitting DIS structure functions and the recent flavor-separated nucleon form factor data [29].",

            "text": "While the VGG and GK models are in fair agreement with the data at low \u2212t, especially for the lowest Q 2 -x B bin, the quark-diquark-based misses the data and tends to diverge away from the measured A UL values going toward higher x B for all \u2212t. The data do not exhibit as strong a drop at high \u2212t as the four models predict. In the low-Q 2 and high-t region, where we also observe a change of shape in the \u03c6 distribution compared to the model predictions (see Fig. 3, last columns of the first two rows), the leading-twist approximation, which is at the core of all these GPD models, could be one of the causes of the discrepancies. The predictions of the VGG and GK models are, as expected, quite similar, as they share common concepts, but start to differ as x B increases: this is to be expected because the GK model contains parameters that were tuned using low-x B HERA data on meson production, and therefore it is not optimized for the valence region (x B 0.3). Moreover, the parametrization of the \u2212t dependence, although Regge-inspired in both cases, is handled differently in the two models. The KMM12 model gives the best fit to the data, especially at the highest x B , but due to its \u2212t < Q 2 4 prescription it cannot be applied to all the available kinematic bins.",

            "text": "In summary, for the first time four-dimensional targetspin asymmetries with longitudinally polarized protons arising from the interference of deeply virtual Compton scattering and Bethe-Heitler were extracted over a large phase space. A UL was measured for 166 bins in Q 2 , x B , \u2212t and \u03c6, with an average statistical precision of \u223c 25%, which largely dominates the systematic uncertainties. The \u03c6 dependence of the obtained asymmetries was studied. Interpreting this result in the GPD framework, the dominance of the leading-twist handbag mechanism can be observed via the prevalence of the sin \u03c6 term, especially at low t and high Q 2 . The t slope of the asymmetry, shallower with respect to that of the beamspin asymmetry in the same kinematic range, suggests, within the leading-twist approximation, that the axial charge is more focused in the center of the proton than the electric charge. Predictions of four GPD-based models are in qualitative agreement at low Q 2 -x B and \u2212t with the data, but fail to predict the correct t dependence of the data in the other kinematics, proving the importance of our results to improve the parametrizations of the GPD H. Thanks to their vast t coverage, our results can also provide a starting point to understand highertwist effects. These data, combined with the beam-spin asymmetry results from CLAS [12] and with the doublespin asymmetry obtained using this same data set [30], will bring strong constraints for model-independent extractions of Generalized Parton Distributions [31][32][33][34].",
