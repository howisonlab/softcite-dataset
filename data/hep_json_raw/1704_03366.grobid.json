            "text": "Numerous extensions of the standard model (SM) predict the existence of new interactions with enhanced couplings to third-generation quarks, especially the top quark. The associated massive new particle contained in these theories could be observed as a tt resonance in experiments at the CERN LHC. Examples of such resonances are: massive color-singlet Z-like bosons (Z ) in extended gauge theories [1][2][3], colorons [4][5][6][7] and axigluons [8][9][10] in models with extended strong interaction sectors, heavier Higgs siblings in models with extended Higgs sectors [11], and Kaluza-Klein (KK) excitations of gluons [12], electroweak gauge bosons [13], and gravitons [14] in various extensions of the Randall-Sundrum (RS) model [15,16]. These models predict the existence of TeV-scale resonances with production cross sections of a few picobarns at \u221a s = 13 TeV . In all of these examples, resonant tt production would be observable in the reconstructed invariant mass spectrum of the top quark-antiquark pair (M tt ).",

We use data recorded in 2015 with the CMS detector in proton-proton (pp) collisions at \u221a s = 13 TeV at the LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.6 fb \u22121 . Four benchmark models are considered: a Z boson decaying exclusively to tt with relative decay widths of 1%, 10%, and 30%, and a KK gluon resonance in the RS model (having a relative decay width of approximately 17%). The Z events are generated in the framework of the sequential SM (SSM) [28]. Although the 1% and 30% widths are unphysical for various masses in that model, assuming SM-like couplings to quarks, this approach enables us to present limits as a function of width, allowing the results to be reinterpreted in models with different resonance widths. The RS KK gluon model is provided as an example of a specific, well-motivated model with a predicted physical width.",

Within the solenoid volume are a silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL), and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter (HCAL). In the region |\u03b7| < 1.74, the HCAL cells have widths of 0.087 in pseudorapidity (\u03b7) and 0.087 radians in azimuth (\u03c6). In the \u03b7-\u03c6 plane, and for |\u03b7| < 1.48, the HCAL cells map on to 5\u00d75 ECAL crystals arrays to form calorimeter towers projecting radially outwards from close to the nominal interaction point. For |\u03b7| > 1.74, the coverage of the towers increases progressively to a maximum of 0.174 in \u2206\u03b7 and \u2206\u03c6. Within each tower, the energy deposits in ECAL and HCAL cells are summed to define the calorimeter tower energies, subsequently used to provide the energies and directions of hadronic jets. Electron momenta are estimated by combining the energy measurement in the ECAL with the momentum measurement in the tracker. Extensive forward calorimetry complements the coverage provided by the barrel and endcap detectors. Muons are measured in gas-ionization detectors embedded in the steel flux-return yoke outside the solenoid. A more detailed description of the CMS detector, together with a definition of the coordinate system used and the relevant kinematic variables, can be found in ref. [29].",

            "text": "Jets are clustered using PF candidates as inputs to the anti-k T algorithm [35] in the FastJet 3.0 software package [36] using two different choices of the distance parameter: R = 0.4 and 0.8. In the following, we refer to the first set of jets as AK4 or small-radius jets, and the second set of jets as AK8 or large-radius jets. For both the small-and largeradius jets, corrections based on the jet area [37] are applied to the energy of the jets to remove the energy contributions from neutral hadrons from pileup interactions. Subsequent corrections are used to account for the combined response function of the calorimeters in both jet energy and mass, as a function of \u03b7 and p T [38]. The jet energy resolution varies from 15% at 10 GeV to 8% at 100 GeV to 4% at 1 TeV for the small-radius jets, and degrades by a few percent for the large-radius jets. The small-radius jets associated with b quarks are identified using the Combined Secondary Vertex v2 (CSVv2) algorithm [39,40]. The working point used for jet b tagging in this analysis has an efficiency of \u224865% (in tt simulated events) and a mistag rate (the fraction of light-flavor jets that are incorrectly tagged) of \u22481% [40]. The large-radius jets with p T > 500 GeV are taken as hadronic top quark candidates. To identify true top quark decays, the \"CMS top tagger v2\" algorithm [41] is used. In this algorithm, the constituents of the AK8 jets are reclustered using the Cambridge-Aachen algorithm [42,43]. The \"modified mass drop tagger\" algorithm [44], also known as the \"soft drop\" (SD) algorithm, recursively declusters a jet into two subjets, discarding soft and wide-angle radiation jet components until a hard splitting criterion is met, to obtain jets consistent with boosted heavy-object decays. This algorithm has been shown to improve jet mass resolution by approximately 40% relative to standard reconstruction techniques [45]. The algorithm is used with angular exponent \u03b2 = 0, soft cutoff threshold z cut < 0.1, and characteristic radius R 0 = 0.8 [46]. This algorithm is also able to identify two subjets within the AK8 jet. The subjet corresponding to the b quark can be identified using subjet b tagging techniques [39]. Specifically, the CSVv2 algorithm, as described above, identifies b-tagged subjets. The algorithm has a comparable performance when applied to subjets, but the uncertainties are larger because of the limited number of highly boosted JHEP07(2017)001 objects used to measure its efficiency. The N-subjettiness observables \u03c4 N are calculated using all PF candidates in the AK8 jet. Each corresponds to a p T -weighted minimum distance from one of N hypothesized subjet axes, defined by the one-pass minimization procedure. These observables are used to quantify the consistency of the particles of a jet with an N-prong decay topology. The variable \u03c4 32 = \u03c4 3 /\u03c4 2 [47,48] is employed to identify the three-pronged substructure of a hadronically decaying top quark. The specific working point used in this analysis is defined by requiring that the soft-dropped mass of the jet satisfies 110 < M SD < 210 GeV and the N-subjettiness variable satisfies \u03c4 32 < 0.69, which corresponds to a misidentification rate (for light-flavor quark and gluon jets) in simulation of 3% [41]. This working point selects top quark jets with an efficiency of approximately 40% when the jet p T is above 500 GeV. Jets selected by the jet mass and N-subjettiness criteria are referred to as \"t-tagged\". Additionally, t-tagged jets are considered to have a subjet b tag if they contain at least one soft-dropped subjet identified as b-tagged using the working point described above.",

Single top quark, Z+jets, and diboson production contribute only a small fraction of the background. The distributions obtained from simulation are corrected to account for known discrepancies in the observed number of data and simulated events. In particular, we derive a scale factor (SF) between data and simulation for the t tagging mistag (t mistag) rate for AK8 jets from a sample dominated by W+jets, selected by requiring events to have \u03c7 2 min > 30. The remaining contamination from tt is removed by subtracting the distribution of tt events in simulation. The t mistag rate is measured separately for the muon and electron channels, in data and simulation. The resulting values, together with the data-tosimulation SFs, are shown in table 1.

The effect due to missing higherorder corrections in the simulation of tt and W+jets production in the SM is estimated by varying the renormalization and factorization scales used in the simulation up and down independently by a factor of 2. Additionally, we account for uncertainties in the simulation of initial-and final-state radiation on the reconstruction of the tt system by using tt events simulated with different Q 2 scales used for the parton shower generation and evolution. Simulated samples for both background and signal processes are generated using PDFs from the NNPDF 3.0 set [63]. The corresponding systematic uncertainty is determined according to the procedure described in ref. [71]. The uncertainty in the total integrated luminosity at \u221a s = 13 TeV is 2.7% [72].

The data-to-simulation correction for the efficiency of the t tagging selection for AK8 jets is measured in situ in the statistical analysis. This is done by leaving this parameter unconstrained in the fit. The t mistag efficiency in the lepton+jets channel (dominated by quarks from W+jets) is measured directly in a control region dominated by W+jets production with an uncertainty of 19%. The t mistag rate in the fully hadronic channel (dominated by gluons from QCD interactions) is measured as described above, with a momentum-dependent uncertainty ranging from 5 to 100%. These uncertainties are estimated by varying the anti-tag criterion for the construction of the anti-tag and probe sample. Systematic uncertainties due to the t tagging efficiency and t mistag rate are treated as uncorrelated.",
