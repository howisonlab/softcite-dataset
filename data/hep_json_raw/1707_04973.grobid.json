We also measure the initial state radiation production cross sections of the \u03a5(2S, 3S) resonances and we find values compatible with the expected ones. Finally, the analysis of the \u03a5(4S) \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03a5(1S) events shows indications for a resonant contribution due to the f0(980) meson.",

            "text": "Recently, hadronic transitions via an \u03b7 meson or two pions between bound states of bottomonium have been recently intensively studied, for instance in [1][2][3][4][5], often with unexpected results. The QCD multipole expansion model [6] can be used generally to describe hadronic transition between the lower mass bottomonium levels, while its predictions fail when considering bottomonia above the BB threshold. In particular, the transitions between bottomonium states via an \u03b7 meson are predicted, for example in [6][7][8], to be highly suppressed, since they require a spin flip of the heavy quark. Among the most unexpected experimental measurements, the BaBar collaboration found an enhancement of the transition \u03a5(4S) \u2192 \u03b7\u03a5(1S) with respect to the transition via a dipion [1]. Also, the Belle collaboration observed the transition \u03a5(4S) \u2192 \u03b7h b (1P ) as the non-BB transition of the \u03a5(4S) with the highest branching fraction [5]. This unsettled picture could be made clearer by the precise measurement of the transitions from the \u03a5(4S) to lowermass \u03a5 states via an \u03b7 meson or a dipion, and also by the search for other possible transitions between bottomonia via an \u03b7 meson.",

The decay \u03b7 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 is not considered in this paper since the corresponding final state has a limited statistical precision, due to the lower signal-to-background ratio than in the decay \u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 .

In addition, a data sample corresponding to 56 fb \u22121 , collected about 60 MeV below the resonance, is used to estimate the background contribution. Decays of \u03a5(3S) and \u03a5(2S) mesons are studied in events recorded at the energy of the \u03a5(4S) and assumed to come from ISR production; the ISR photon is typically emitted almost collinear to the beam direction and is not required to be reconstructed. The equivalent luminosity for a narrow vector resonance produced in ISR events is calculated as in Ref. [12], and is \u223c 17.1 pb and \u223c 28.6 pb for the \u03a5(2S) and the \u03a5(3S), respectively. The Belle detector (described in detail elsewhere [13,14]) is a large-solid-angle magnetic spectrometer that consists of a silicon vertex detector, a 50-layer central drift chamber (CDC), an array of aerogel threshold Cherenkov counters (ACC), a barrel-like arrangement of time-of-flight scintillation counters, and an electromagnetic calorimeter comprised of CsI(Tl) crystals (ECL) located inside a super-conducting solenoid coil that provides a 1.5 T magnetic field. An iron flux-return located outside of the coil is instrumented to detect K 0 L mesons and to identify muons (KLM).",
