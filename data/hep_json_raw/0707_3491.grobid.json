The transition amplitudes can be categorized as due to either external W -or internal (colorsuppressed) W -emission diagrams. The decay B + \u2192 D 0 D 0 K + [1] can proceed through both types of diagrams; thus it is promising for searches for new cs states as well as for some cc states lying above D 0D0 threshold. The unexpected discoveries of the D * s0 (2317) and D s1 (2460) mesons show that our understanding of cs spectroscopy might be incomplete, while experimental data on cc states with decay channels open to D ( * )D( * ) are scarce.",

The resonance parameters and product branching fractions are summarized in Table I (the first error is statistical, the second is systematic). The systematic errors on the product branching fractions and the resonance parameters include contributions from uncertainties in the yields of the \u03c8(4160) reflection (including the recent \u03c8(4160) parameter determination [9]), the threshold parameterization, sensitivities of parameters to the fit range and parameterization, uncertainties in the LR B selection, as well as uncertainties due to interference effects that were neglected. The systematics due to the latter are determined from MC simulations of Dalitz plot densities with and without interference of contributing amplitudes, with each contributing resonance parameterized by a BW form. The resonance parameters from Table I and the threshold enhancement parameters are used to determine the amplitudes. The effects of interference of the \u03c8(3770) with other states are found to be small and are neglected in the simulations. These MC samples, with maximal constructive and destructive interferences, were analysed ignoring interference effects. The differences between the obtained resonance parameters and the input values are taken as systematic errors.",

Here cos \u03b8 hel for \u03c8(3770) is defined as before, whereas for D sJ (2700) + it is the angle between the K + momentum vector and the direction opposite theD 0 in the D 0 K + rest frame. The obtained angular distributions are then corrected using bin-by-bin efficiencies. The expected reflections from \u03c8(4160) and from the threshold component are subtracted from the D sJ (2700) + angular distribution. Spin hypotheses for the resonances are tested by comparing predictions for the different hypotheses to the corrected angular distributions. The \u03c8(3770) distribution (not shown) is well described by the J = 1 hypothesis (\u03c7 2 /ndf = 3.6/5). The D sJ (2700) + distribution ( Fig. 4(d)) favours J = 1 (11/5); the J = 0 (112/5) and J = 2 (146/5) assignments can be rejected.

The observed rate for \u03c8(3770) production in B meson decays confirms our previous observation [11]. The D sJ (2700) + is a previously unobserved resonance in the D 0 K + system with a mass M = 2708 \u00b1 9 +11 \u221210 MeV/c 2 , width \u0393 = 108 \u00b1 23 +36 \u221231 MeV/c 2 and J P = 1 \u2212 . The statistical significance of this observation is 8.4\u03c3. Based on its observed decay channel, we interpret the D sJ (2700) + resonance as a cs meson. Potential model calculations [12] predict a cs radially excited 2 3 S 1 state with a mass 2710-2720 MeV/c 2 . From chiral symmetry considerations [13] a 1 + -1 \u2212 doublet of states has been predicted. If the 1 + state is identified as the D s1 (2536), the mass predicted for the 1 \u2212 state is M = 2721 \u00b1 10 MeV/c 2 . Additional measurements of the meson properties are needed to distinguish between these two interpretations.",
