The searches are performed in the Higgs boson mass range from 100 to 200 GeV/c 2 . The dominant production channels, H \u2192 bb and H \u2192 WW , are combined with all the secondary channels and significant analysis improvements have been implemented to maximize the search sensitivity. We observe a significant excess of data events compared to background predictions with the local significance of 3.0 standard deviations. The global significance for such an excess anywhere in the full mass range investigated is approximately 2.5 standard deviations.",

Within the SM, vector boson masses arise from the spontaneous breaking of electroweak symmetry due to the existence of the Higgs particle. The winter results from the LHC and the Tevatron experiments have excluded wide regions of the possible Higgs mass ranges. The most interesting region to search for the Higgs is the mass range between 115 and 127 GeV/c 2 where the both the ATLAS and the CMS experiments have found some excesses [1,2]. The Tevatron experiments can contribute to the understanding of this region by analyzing the data collected through the years of 2001-2011.",

In all low mass Higgs searches at Tevatron, we include additional variables through the multivariate analysis techniques. Dedicated studies have been performed to improve the search sensitivity through the improvements in dijet mass resolution, lepton identification algorithm, btagging, multijet background suppression and modeling, final discriminant optimization. The detailed information on low mass Higgs channels is present in Ref. [7,8,9,10,11,12] To validate our background modeling and search methods, we perform a search for SM diboson production in the same final states used for the SM H \u2192 bb searches. The data sample, reconstruction, process modeling, uncertainties, and sub-channel divisions are identical to those of the SM Higgs boson search. The measured cross section for W Z and ZZ production is \u03c3 (WW + W Z) = 4.47 \u00b1 0.64 (stat) +0.73 \u22120.72 (syst) pb [13]. This is consistent with SM prediction of \u03c3 (WW +W Z) = 4.4 \u00b1 0.3 pb [14] and corresponds to a significance of 4.6 standard deviations above the background-only hypothesis.",

Being the most sensitive channel for the high mass Higgs region, it has significant contribution to the low mass region as well. For the H \u2192 WW analyses, signal events are characterized by large E T and two oppositesigned, isolated leptons. The presence of neutrinos in the final state prevents the accurate reconstruction of the candidate Higgs boson mass. The most sensitive variable for Higgs signal is the opening angle, \u2206R, between the outgoing leptons.

A broad excess is observed in data with respect to the background estimation, corresponding to a 2.5 standard deviations. Considering only the H \u2192 bb final state searches yields an excess, corresponding to a 3.1 standard deviations. The excess is observed to be consistent with SM Higgs boson production.",
