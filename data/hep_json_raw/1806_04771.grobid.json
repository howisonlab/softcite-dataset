The search is based on proton-proton collision data at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV collected at the CERN LHC in 2016 and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 . No significant excess over the expected standard model background is observed. Upper limits at 95% confidence level are presented for the product of the production cross section and branching fraction in the context of two benchmark simplified models. For the Z -two-Higgs-doublet model (where Z is a new massive boson mediator) with an intermediate heavy pseudoscalar particle of mass m A = 300 GeV and m DM = 100 GeV, the Z masses from 550 GeV to 1265 GeV are excluded. For a baryonic Z model, with m DM = 1 GeV, Z masses up to 615 GeV are excluded. Results are also presented for the spin-independent cross section for the dark matter-nucleon interaction as a function of the mass of the dark matter particle. This is the first search for dark matter particles produced in association with a Higgs boson decaying to two \u03c4 leptons.",

            "text": "Previous searches for h + p miss T have been performed at both the ATLAS and CMS experiments. No excesses were observed in either h \u2192 bb or h \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 decay channels with 20.3 (36) fb \u22121 of data at \u221a s = 8 (13) TeV [9][10][11] or with 2.3-36.1 fb \u22121 of data at \u221a s = 13 TeV [12][13][14]. This paper examines two Higgs boson decay channels: h \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 and h \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 . Two simplified models for DM+h production are used as benchmarks for this search, both of which were recommended by the LHC Dark Matter Forum [15]. The leading order (LO) Feynman diagrams for these models are shown in figure 1. The first benchmark model (figure 1 left) is a Z -two-Higgs-doublet model (Z -2HDM) [7]. In this scenario, the SM is extended by a U(1) Z group, with a new massive Z boson mediator, while a Type-2 2HDM framework [16,17] is used to formulate the extended Higgs sector. At LO, the Z boson is produced resonantly and decays into an SM-like Higgs boson and an intermediate heavy pseudoscalar particle (A). The A then decays into a pair of Dirac fermionic DM particles. This analysis does not consider the contribution of the decay Z \u2192 Zh which can have a h + p miss T signature if Z \u2192 \u03bd\u03bd. The second diagram (figure 1 right) describes a baryonic Z model [8]. In this scenario, a new massive vector mediator Z emits a Higgs boson and then decays to a pair of Dirac fermionic DM particles. Here, the baryonic gauge boson Z arises from a new U(1) B baryon number symmetry. A baryonic Higgs boson (h B ) is introduced to spontaneously break the new symmetry and generates the Z boson mass via a coupling that is dependent on the h B vacuum expectation value. The Z couplings to quarks and DM are proportional to the U(1) B gauge couplings. There is a mixing between h B and the SM Higgs boson, allowing the Z to radiate an SM-like Higgs boson. The stable baryonic states in this model are the candidate DM particles.",

The h \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 channel benefits from higher precision in reconstructed invariant mass and the h \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 channel benefits from smaller SM background. Additionally, the h \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 and h \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 channels are not dependent on p miss T trigger thresholds, as such searches in these channels are complementary to those in the h \u2192 bb channel since they can probe DM scenarios with lower p miss T . The search in the h \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 channel uses a fit in the diphoton invariant mass spectrum to extract the signal yield. In addition to a high-p miss T category, a low-p miss T category is also considered to extend the phase space of the search. In the h \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 channel, the three decay channels of the \u03c4 lepton with the highest branching fractions are analyzed. After requiring an amount of p miss T in order to sufficiently suppress the quantum chromodynamic (QCD) multijet background, the signal is extracted by performing a simultaneous fit to the transverse mass of the p miss T and the two \u03c4 lepton candidates in the signal region (SR) and control regions (CRs).",

Within the solenoid volume are a silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead-tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL), and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter (HCAL). Extensive forward calorimetry complements the coverage provided by the barrel and endcap detectors. Charged particle trajectories are measured by the silicon pixel and strip tracker system, covering 0 \u2264 \u03c6 \u2264 2\u03c0 in azimuth and |\u03b7| < 2.50, where the pseudorapidity is \u03b7 = \u2212 ln (tan \u03b8/2), and \u03b8 is the polar angle with respect to the counterclockwise beam direction. Muons are measured in gas-ionization detectors embedded in the steel flux-return yoke. A more detailed description of the CMS detector can be found in ref. [19].",

An additional veto on the presence of a track pointing to the ECAL cluster is applied to reject electrons that could be reconstructed as photons. Scale factors, extracted from Z \u2192 e + e \u2212 events using the tag- and-probe method [49], are applied to the simulated samples to account for any discrepancy in identification efficiency between data and simulation. The isolation variables that are used in the photon identification are calculated by summing the p T of PF photons, neutral hadrons, or charged hadrons associated with the PV in a cone of radius \u2206R = \u221a (\u2206\u03b7) 2 + (\u2206\u03c6) 2 = 0.3. The isolation variables are corrected by the median transverse momentum density of the event to mitigate the effects of pileup [50]. Some of the signals considered can have Lorentz-boosted topologies. For example, highmass mediators could result in a large boost to the Higgs boson. When a boosted Higgs boson decays to two photons, the resulting photons hit the ECAL close to each other. This effect leads to large contributions from one photon to the photon isolation sum of the other. In order to maintain high efficiency for high-mass mediator signals, the photon isolation requirement is not applied to photons that are within \u2206R < 0.3 of each other.",

Simulated signal and background samples that pass the preselection were used to study the discriminating power of variables such as p miss T , the p T of the diphoton system p T\u03b3\u03b3 , and the ratio p T /m \u03b3\u03b3 for each photon. A selection on p T that scales with m \u03b3\u03b3 is chosen so that it does not distort the shape of the m \u03b3\u03b3 distribution. The p T\u03b3\u03b3 variable is included in the selection because it has higher resolution than the event's measured p miss T and is expected to be large for signal events, since the Higgs boson is produced back-to-back with p miss T . A high-p miss T category (p miss T \u2265 130 GeV) is optimal for the two benchmark models presented in this paper. A lowp miss T category (50 < p miss T < 130 GeV), optimized using as reference the baryonic Z signal model, is also included to probe softer signals, namely signals that may not be observed in other h + p miss T searches because they rely heavily on p miss T for background rejection. The chosen requirements, found to optimize the signal sensitivity for both models in the lowand high-p miss T categories, are given in table 1. Further background rejection is achieved using two topological requirements. The azimuthal separation |\u2206\u03c6(p \u03b3\u03b3 , p miss T )| between p miss T and the Higgs boson direction reconstructed from the two photons must be greater than 2.1 to select events in which the Higgs boson and p miss T are back-to-back. Events with highly energetic jets collinear to p miss T are removed by the requirement that the min|\u2206\u03c6(p jet , p miss T )| be greater than 0.5 for any jet with p T above 50 GeV. This rejects events with a large misreconstructed p miss T arising from mismeasured jet p T . Finally, events are vetoed if they have three or more jets each with p T above 30 GeV, to reject multijet backgrounds while maintaining a high efficiency for the two benchmark signal models. The p miss T distribution of the selected events is shown in figure 2. Observed for events passing the requirements given in table 1. Events with p miss T below 50 GeV are not used in the analysis. The cross sections of the signals are set to 1 pb. The total simulated background is normalized to the integral of the data. The statistical uncertainty in the total background is shown by the hatched bands. The data-to-simulation ratio is shown in the lower panel.",

However, the largest source of uncertainty is statistical. As mentioned in section 4.2, no systematic uncertainties are applied to the nonresonant background, which is extracted from a fit to data, since the bias of the fit is negligible compared to the statistical uncertainty of the data set. The systematic uncertainties for the h \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 channel are summarized in table 3. In addition to the theoretical uncertainties mentioned above, a 20% cross section uncertainty is included for the ggh sample, based on the CMS differential measurements of h \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3, for diphoton p T above 70 GeV [58]. The branching fraction uncertainty [57]   Observed  Figure 4. Distributions of the total transverse mass M tot T in the SR for the e\u03c4 h (upper left), \u00b5\u03c4 h (upper right), and \u03c4 h \u03c4 h (lower) final states are shown after the simultaneous maximum-likelihood fit. Representative signal distributions are shown with cross sections normalized to 1 pb. The data points are shown with their statistical uncertainties. The statistical uncertainty of the observed distribution is represented by the error bars on the data points. The overflow of each distribution is included in the final 400-500 GeV bin. Single top processes are included in the \"Diboson\" contribution. The \"Other DY\" contribution includes background from Z \u2192 . The systematic uncertainty related to the background prediction is indicated by the shaded band.  In addition to the integrated luminosity uncertainty, several other experimental sources of systematic uncertainty are included in this analysis. The trigger efficiency uncertainty (approximately 1%) is extracted from Z \u2192 e + e \u2212 events using a tag-and-probe technique [49]. The photon identification uncertainty of 2% arises from the observed difference in efficiencies between data and simulation. A 0.5% energy scale uncertainty is assigned to take into account the knowledge of the photon energy scale at the Z boson mass peak and its extrapolation to the Higgs boson mass. Additionally, several p miss T -related uncertainties are applied. The systematic uncertainty from mismeasured p miss T is evaluated by comparing the tail of the p miss T distributions in data and simulation in a \u03b3 + jet enriched CR. The efficiencies with which data and simulated events pass the p miss T selection are compared. The difference in efficiency is 50% and is included as a systematic uncertainty associated with mismeasured p miss T . However, the contribution of simulated backgrounds with mismeasured p miss T is quite small since only the ggh and VBF SM h \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 production modes contribute. Finally, a systematic uncertainty, which is less than 4%, is applied to take into account the difference in efficiency between data and simulation when applying the topological \u2206\u03c6 requirements in the low-p miss T region. This uncertainty is evaluated using Z \u2192 e + e \u2212 events, and only affects the ggh and VBF simulated samples.",

Cross section uncertainties of the order of 5% are applied to the tt (6%), top quark (5%), and diboson (5%) processes [59][60][61][62]. In simulated Z + jets samples, a shape uncertainty of 10% of the Z boson p T reweighting correction, to account for higherorder effects, is used. The uncertainty in the Z+jets background contribution is about 12% in the SR. The tt contribution includes a shape systematic uncertainty equivalent to 5% related to the top quark p T spectrum, since there is evidence that the spectrum is softer in data than in simulation [62]. A 1.2% uncertainty in the \u03c4 lepton energy scale [44] is propagated through to the final signal extraction variables. The \u03c4 lepton energy scale depends on the \u03c4 h decay mode and is correlated across all channels. A shape uncertainty is used for the uncertainty in the double \u03c4 h trigger. A shift of 3% of the p T of the trigger-level \u03c4 h candidate leads to a 12% normalization difference at 40 GeV, and a 2% difference at 60 GeV. For p T > 60 GeV, a constant 2% systematic uncertainty is applied.",

The uncertainty increases to about 20% near a \u03c4 h candidate p T = 200 GeV, and acts to change the shape of the M tot T distribution. An asymmetric uncertainty related to the identification of \u03c4 h with a high p T is applied to signal and background simulation. The high-p T \u03c4 h efficiency measurement uses selected highly virtual W bosons and has limited statistical precision in comparison to the lower p T Z \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 and tt \u03c4 h efficiency studies. Therefore the asymmetric uncertainty is used in combination with a constant scale factor. It is proportional to p T and has a value of +5% and \u221235% per 1 TeV.

The expected and observed yields are used to calculate an upper limit on the production cross section of DM+h production via the Z -2HDM mechanism. Upper limits are computed [63] at 95% confidence level (CL) using a profile likelihood ratio and the modified frequentist criterion [64,65] with an asymptotic approximation [66]. The upper limits are obtained for each Higgs boson decay channel separately and for the statistical combination of the two. The two decay channels are combined using the Higgs boson branching fractions predicted by the SM [57]. In the combination of the two analyses, the theoretical uncertainties in the Higgs boson cross section and the systematic uncertainty in the integrated luminosity are assumed to be fully correlated between the two decay channels. Figure 5 shows the 95% CL expected and observed upper limits on the DM production cross section (\u03c3 95% CL ) as a function of Z mass. Both the h \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 and h \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 channels, as well as the combination of the two, are shown for m A = 300 GeV. These upper limits, although obtained with a DM mass of 100 GeV, can be considered valid for any DM mass below 100 GeV since the branching fraction for decays of A to DM particles decreases as the dark matter mass increases. The theoretical cross section (\u03c3 th ) is calculated with m DM = 100 GeV, g Z = 0.8, and g DM = tan \u03b2 = 1, as mentioned in section 1.",
