The number of selected events at 8 TeV is about a factor of 5 larger than the number of events at 7 TeV.

The unfolded A FB (M) measurements for \u03bc\u03bc and ee events, within |y| < 2.4, are combined under the assumption that the uncertainties in the muon and electron channels are uncorrelated. Any effect of the correlation between the \u03bc\u03bc and ee systematic uncertainties in the pileup correction, FSR modeling, and the normalization of MC simulations in the background estimation is found to have a negligible effect on the combination.  Table 2 summarizes the combined A FB quantity for each rapidity region. The unfolded A FB distribution for the forward rapidity region (2.4 < |y| < 5) is shown in Fig. 5. The forward rapidity region extends the scope of the measurement beyond that of the previous CMS result at \u221a s = 7 TeV. Because A FB in the forward rapidity region is diluted less, the measured A FB quantity is closer to the parton-level asymmetry after the unfolding process, than it is in the central rapidity bins.

            "text": "The combined (ee and \u03bc\u03bc) A FB measurements, with statistical and systematic uncertainties for the four rapidity regions with |y| < 2.4. The A FB quantity for ee events is also shown for 2.4 < |y| < 5 integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb \u22121 . The A FB measurement is performed as a function of the dilepton invariant mass between 40 GeV and 2 TeV for \u03bc\u03bc and ee events in 4 dilepton rapidity bins up to |y| = 2.4. For ee events with 2.4 < |y| < 5, the A FB measurement is performed for dielectron masses between 40 and 320 GeV. The large data sample collected at 8 TeV extends the measurement of A FB in the high mass region compared to previous results. The final A FB values are corrected for detector resolution, acceptance, and final state radiation effects. The measurements of A FB (M) are consistent with standard model predictions.",
