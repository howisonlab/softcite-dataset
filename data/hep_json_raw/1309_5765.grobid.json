For each target and energy, a comparison between simulated values based on the LPM suppression of incoherent bremsstrahlung is shown, taking multi-photon effects into account. For these targets and energies, we find that Migdal's theoretical formulation is adequate to a precision of better than about 5%, irrespective of the target substance.",

            "text": "The well-known Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal (LPM) effect, which reduces the radiation emission from an ultrarelativistic electron in a medium due to multiple Coulomb scattering, has been investigated extensively at both SLAC and CERN. Nevertheless, the question remains if the 'traditional' approach of using Migdal's theoretical formulation is adequate in the case of targets of low nuclear charge. Since the LPM effect is routinely applied in codes used to interpret extended air showers which naturally occur in a low-Z medium, the answer to this question is important. There is reason to suspect a certain degree of inadequacy since Migdal applied the Thomas-Fermi approach to determine the screening [1, eq. (22)], an approach that is inherently statistical and therefore inaccurate for atoms with few electrons, see e.g. [2]. As essentially all experiments are performed in the full-screening limit, the inaccuracy of the screening model might lead to imprecise answers. Furthermore, the contribution from electrons may be influenced differently by the LPM effect than the nuclear contribution since a different range of momentum transfers are relevant and different screening parameters involved [3]. And, finally, seemingly unphysical 'kinks' in the calculated spectra based on Migdal's formulation appear when the Migdal formula reaches the Bethe-Heitler (BH) level.",

The electron beam was defined by the scintillator counters S1, S2, S3, where the latter is a 9 mm hole scintillator (used as a veto). The beam chosen in this way is centered on the target, and, after having traversed this, the electrons are swept away by two dipole magnets, connected in series. This method of separation inevitably introduces Synchrotron radiation (SR), the implication of which will be discussed below. To be able to correct for the background, an empty target run was performed. Vacuum pipes were used when possible, to reduce background to a minimum in the 70 m long setup. The beam spot size at the calorimeter position was determined by scanning a 5 mm wide scintillator counter in the vertical and horizontal direction in front of the BGO. From these measurements we find a gaussian beam with a standard deviation of \u03c3 \u2248 12 mm. We can also use this to determine the beam divergence, since the size of the beam is limited by the 9 mm hole scintillator. If it is assumed that the angle made by the direction of the particle and the beam axis is proportional to the distance of the particle from the axis, we calculate a beam divergence of around 0.2 mrad for particles just inside the hole scintillator. This is in good agreement with previous measurements with drift chambers [9,10].",

The detector has been calibrated with an extracted beam from the Aarhus STorage RIng Denmark (ASTRID) where electrons with energies from 100 MeV to 580 MeV are available. This has been done since it is not possible to get an electron beam with an energy below 10 GeV in the North Experimental Area at CERN. It was found that the energy deposit in the BGO was in good agreement with Geant4 simulations in this energy regime (see FIG. 2) and that the detector response was linear ( see FIG. 3 by a slight non-linearity at energies below 200 MeV and by not including the systematic errors which are difficult to quantify. A high-energy point at 2.6 GeV was measured earlier at CERN with tagged electrons [12]. This measurement showed that the calibration at low-energies could safely be extrapolated to multi-GeV energies and combined with the ASTRID data, this shows that the detector response is linear in the energy regime from 200 MeV up to 2.6 GeV. At energies below 200 MeV the mentioned slight non-linearity shifts the energies by up to 6 MeV.

In the high-energy environment at CERN, the detector will occasionally be hit by photons with more than 100 GeV. These events are believed to saturate the PMT and affect the detector for a substantial amount of time after the event. We have therefore marked events occuring within 50, 200 and 500 \u00b5s after a high-energy event. We have also measured the detector output just before the pulse. This can be used to ensure that the detector has reached its base level, before a new event occurs. Early investigations of the detector led to the conclusion that the PMT should be run at a very low High Voltage (HV) of 405 V to minimize saturation. This is significantly below the recommendations by the PMT supplier, 1140 V, based on calibrations with Cs-137 giving 661 keV photons. Nevertheless, our measurements show that this does not affect the linearity of the detector, which has been tested several times.",

The goal is to investigate how a high-energy event affects the detector. We mimic this with a short light pulse from a diode, a laserdiode and an actual pulsed laser. Since the PMT is glued onto the BGO crystal, it is not possible to disassemble the detector and shine light directly onto the photocathode of the PMT. However, it could be accessed from the back by removing an endcap (Photonics XP3330 are no longer available). We used a pulsed nanosecond laser to inject a light pulse into the detector. Surprisingly, the response saturated at signal heights well below ones observed at CERN. The cause of this is uncertain. A possible explanation could be that the laser only illuminates part of the photocathode, causing a smaller signal than if the full photocathode is illuminated. We have investigated how low-energy events occuring shortly after a saturation event are affected. This has been done with a second light pulse from a diode which is triggered by the laser. The delay between the laser pulse and the diode was varied from 84 \u00b5s to 400 \u00b5s and only a small effect was observed, with a reduction in the signal height of about \u223c 10% when the delay was reduced from 260 \u00b5s to 84 \u00b5s. No effect was seen when the delay was reduced from 400 \u00b5s to 260 \u00b5s. Since the affected data are flaged by the DAQ system, this effect can be removed from the data in the analysis.",

The simulations and the data agree very well above 200 MeV and for the low-energy rise below 30 MeV. The magnetic field of the two dipoles is 0.17 T which introduces SR with a critical energy of 3.6 MeV which is well below the low-energy rise. From simulations with and without the LG calorimeter it is clearly seen that the main cause of the lowenergy rise is backsplash from the LG. This arises since events where only low-energy photons are emitted, are accompanied by a high-energy electron which is only deflected \u223c 7 cm by the two dipoles at the position of the detectors. Unfortunately, the amount of backsplash was not discovered during the experiment. In the intermediate energy region from 30 MeV to 200 MeV there is a dip in the radiation spectrum which is not well understood. Several explanations for this dip have been tested, but all unsuccessful.",

This method has been used in a previous experiment [15] and only calculates the radiation emitted by the electron and does not track the particle through the setup. It includes a BH radiation background, SR from the magnets and radiation from the target. We ignore the energy loss of the electron, which can safely be done since we are only interested in events with a low energy loss. However, since we do not track the particle through the setup and therefore do not include the veto scintillator, we have to determine a detection efficiency. This was not neccessary for the Geant4 simulations above. We assume that the efficiency can simply be modelled as a multiplicative factor which varies slightly with energy. We use the ratio of the radiation spectrum from the aluminium reference to the background to determine the amount of material in the background ( see FIG. 7). We use these two, since both only include SR and BH radiation, which are well-known. By taking the ratio between the two measurements, we remove the detection efficiency, and we can directly compare our data to the simulations. We find that the amount of background material is 3%X 0 , which corresponds to the 1.7%X 0 mentioned earlier plus scintillators, mylar foil, air, etc. in the target area. With this background we find the efficiency by dividing the background measurements with the simulations. The result is shown in FIG. 8. We observe a significant efficiency drop from 50 MeV to 200 MeV as was also expected from the Geant4 simulations, but from the ratio (see FIG. 7) it is reasonable to assume that the efficiency corrected simulations are valid down to \u223c 100 MeV, where also the simulations begin to deviate from our measurements. For the 20 GeV data we have used the same method, except that SR is neglected since the critical energy is 0.1 MeV and therefore way below our detection threshold.",

However, after the SLAC measurements several other theoretical models were developed. For 178 GeV electrons in carbon and 20 GeV in copper, we also calculate the radiation cross section according to the formalism of Blankenbecler & Drell (BD) [17]. Blankenbecler later refined their treatment of the problem and included an extra correlation term [18]. We have calculated both expressions for the two cases. Alternative descriptions of the LPM effect have also been developed by Baier & Katkov (BK) [19] and Zakharov [20]. The BK description has been calculated for 178 GeV electrons in carbon. The spectra of the radiated power by 178 GeV electrons traversing a carbon target with a thickness corresponding to 1.97%X 0 is shown in FIG. 9. The differences between the curves are small but worth mentioning. For the BD curve we observe a flattening around 5 MeV. This is related to the finite thickness of the target. If the target thickness is equated to the formation length given by l f = 2\u03b3 2 c/\u03c9 one finds \u03c9 = 10 MeV. This means that for photons with an energy below 10 MeV, one cannot consider the target as semi-infinite and one has to take the size into account. This is naturally incorporated into the BD formalism, but not included in Migdal's formulas. However, this is below our detection limit and does not affect our measurements. We can also ignore transition radiation and dielectric suppression for the same reason. For an experimental investigation of the effects related to the finite target size in the context of bremsstrahlung, the reader is directed to [12]. It is also interesting to notice that it is only the Migdal formulation which shows a small bend around 1200 MeV. The BK curve does not show this but is smooth and otherwise very close to the Migdal curve. The BD curve is also very similar to Migdal curve above 10 MeV, but the BD\u2212\u03b4 curve is consistently slightly below except for the lowest energies, where the size of the target plays a role and one cannot directly compare them. The 20 GeV spectra in FIG. 10 generally show the same tendencies and the same tendencies are seen for other target materials. ",

On the scale of about 5% there is no experimentally based reason to suspect that the widely applied model of Migdal should be inadequate, in spite of the statistical nature of the screening function applied and the differing LPM contribution from electrons. Thus, for instance simulations of extended air showers based on the Migdal formulation should be reliable -for this mechanism and given that the present test can be extrapolated to higher energies -to an accuracy of better than 5%. The carbon data have a preference for the Migdal formula, and the BD\u2212\u03b4 curve is consistently slightly below our data. This is in disagreement with previous results on structured targets [15], which had a slight preference for the BD\u2212\u03b4 theory. Oppositely, it is in agreement with measurements on thin targets, where the BD\u2212\u03b4 theory was also disfavoured [21].",
