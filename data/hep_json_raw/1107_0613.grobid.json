            "text": "The nuclear emulsion target of the CHORUS detector was exposed to the wide-band neutrino beam of the CERN SPS of 27 GeV average neutrino energy from 1994 to 1997. In total, about 100 000 charged-current (CC) neutrino interactions with at least one identified muon were located in the emulsion target and fully reconstructed, using newly developed automated scanning systems. Charmed particles were searched for by a program recognizing particle decays. The observation of the decay in nuclear emulsion makes it possible to select a sample with very low background and minimal kinematical bias. In all, 2013 CC interactions with a charmed hadron candidate in the final state were selected and confirmed through visual inspection. The charm production rate induced by neutrinos relative to the CC cross-section is measured to be \u03c3 (\u03bd \u00b5 N \u2192 \u00b5 \u2212 C X )/\u03c3 (CC) = (5.75 \u00b1 0.32(stat) \u00b1 0.30(syst))%. The charm production cross-section as a function of neutrino energy is also obtained. The results are in good agreement with previous measurements. The charm-quark hadronization produces the following charmed hadrons with relative fractions (in %): f D 0 = 43.7 \u00b1 4.5, f + c = 19.2 \u00b1 4.2, f D + = 25.3 \u00b1 4.2 and f D s + = 11.8 \u00b1 4.7.",

In particular, neutrino-induced charm production offers the possibility of studying the strange-quark content of the nucleon, measuring 'directly' the CKM matrix element V cd and testing models for charm production and subsequent hadronization. Moreover, neutrinos produce charmed hadrons via specific processes such as quasi-elastic and diffractive scattering, which provide a unique tool for studies of exclusive charm production.",

In particular, CDHS [6], CCFR [7], CHARM [8], CHARM-II [9], NuTeV [10] and CHORUS (using only its electronic detectors) [11] have collected large statistics of opposite-sign dimuon events. The leading muon is interpreted as originating from the neutrino vertex and the other one, of opposite charge, as being the decay product of the charmed particle. Although massive electronic detectors allow obtaining large statistics, they have some drawbacks. Of the charmed parent, only the decay muon is seen, resulting in an event sample composed of a mixture of all charmed-particle species weighted by their muonic branching ratios. Furthermore, experiments of this type suffer from significant background (\u223c20%) due to the undetected decay-in-flight of a pion or a kaon. The identification of the primary muon and the decay muon is not unambiguous. Moreover, the kinematic cuts on the energies of the primary and decay muons, required for background reduction, make it difficult to study cross-sections at energies below 20-30 GeV.",

In nuclear emulsion, the different charmed particles are recognized on the basis of their decay topology and short flight length, so that the required kinematic cuts can be quite loose. All decay channels are therefore observed, not only the muonic ones, without requiring knowledge of muonic branching ratios and with very low background. The disadvantage of the low statistics generally obtained in emulsion experiments (122 charm events observed in E531) has been overcome in the CHORUS experiment [16] by using a massive (770 kg) nuclear emulsion target and automated emulsion scanning [17,18]. A high-statistics sample of charm decays in emulsion, more than one order of magnitude larger than in E531, has thus been collected as reported in this paper.",

Only ratios of electronic reconstruction and vertex location efficiencies need to be determined, thus reducing significantly the systematic error. The overall selection efficiencies relative to the selection of CC events for different decay topologies are shown in table 2. The requirement that at least one track of the secondary vertex be matched with a track in the electronic detectors causes the efficiency to be higher with increasing numbers of prongs at the decay vertex. Figure 1 shows the detection efficiency of charged charmed hadrons D + , D + s and + c relative to CC interactions as a function of neutrino energy. Two factors make the selection less efficient at small visible energies: the decay angle of the charm daughters is larger; the flight length of the charm parent is shorter and thus a secondary track might be wrongly attached to the primary vertex.

The flight length is very precisely measured in the emulsion target. The flight length distributions for the one-prong and three-prong events are shown in figure 2. The momentum is not directly measured, but it can be estimated by exploiting the correlation between the momentum and the decay angle of the products [37]. For a given decay mode, this correlation is determined by the decay kinematics. Figure 3 shows the correlation between charm momentum and the daughter's inverse opening angle. The charm parent momentum is obtained from the opening angle of the decay products using a parameterization evaluated with simulated events. The resolution obtained with this method is about 25% for three-prong events and 35% for one-prong events. To achieve statistical separation of the different charged charm species, a likelihood function is constructed for each event using the decay lifetime information. Following [38], the form of the probability function for each event (n) is expressed as the sum of probabilities for the three final state particle hypotheses i (i = + c , D + , D + s ). Using the numbers of hadrons of each species, N i , as the free parameters of the fit, the probability takes the form",

Energy dependence for charged (squares) and neutral (triangles) charm cross-section ratio relative to CC cross-section. measurement is shown. Very good agreement is found with respect to the dimuon cross-section measured with the CHORUS electronic detector by scaling the dimuon results for the muonic charm decay fraction quoted in this paper.",
