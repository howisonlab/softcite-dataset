No excess above the standard model background is observed. The results are interpreted in various SUSY models, and we are able to exclude gluino (sbottom) masses up to 1000 (450) GeV at 95% CL.",

We will assume that the SUSY decay chain ends with the LSP ( \u03c7 0 1 ), that escapes undetected and therefore contribute strongly to the E miss T of the event. In general, same-sign dileptons can be particularly sensitive to SUSY models with compressed spectra where the mass of the LSP is very close to the mass of the produced supersymetric particle, by requiring two same-sign leptons we can recover events that may skip other selections. We therefore search for SUSY using same sign dilepton events with hadronic activity and large E miss T and we interpret the results in the context of various SUSY models. What we present here is just a short summary of the analysis performed by CMS [1], more details can be found in the original publication [2].",

The isolation of the leptons is computed with particle-flow information, and an event-by-event correction is made to account for the effect of the multiple pp interaction in the same bunch crossing (pileup). This correction consists in substracting the estimated contribution from the pileup in the isolation cone.",

We estimate this background starting from measuring the probability of a lepton being fake or prompt using a QCD or Z enriched sample respectively. We then apply those probabilities to events passing the full kinematic selection but in which one or two of the leptons fail the isolation requirements. About 40-50% of the total background is due to this processes and we assign a 50% systematic uncertainty to account for the lack of estatistics in the control sample as well as the little knowledge we about about the control sample composition.",

We estimate this background by selecting opposite-sign ee or e\u00b5 events passing the full kinematic selection, weighted by the probability of electron charge misassignment. This probability is measured in a Z \u2192 ee sample in data by simply calculating the ratio between samesign and opposite-sign events in such sample and it validated in MC, this probability is of the order 0.02 (0.2)% for electrons in the barrel(endcap).

These models have more than two mass parameters, and cannot be fully represented in a two dimensional plot. Table 1. A summary of the combination of results for this search. For each signal region (SR), we show its most distinguishing kinematic requirements, the prediction for the three background (BG) components as well as the total, and the observed number of events. None of the search regions shows any significant excess over the SM background predictions, therefore we set interpret the results in several physics models [2]. For example Figure 1 shows the exclusion regions for gluino-pair production decaying into on-shell stops as well as direct sbotton pair production. We are able to exclude gluino (sbottom) masses up to 1 (0.45) TeV with such models.",
