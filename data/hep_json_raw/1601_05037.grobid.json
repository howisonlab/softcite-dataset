The analysis uses a 14 kton-equivalent exposure of 2.74 \u00d7 10 20 protons-on-target from the Fermilab NuMI beam. Assuming the normal neutrino mass hierarchy, we measure \u2206m 2 32 = (2.52 +0.20   \u22120.18 )\u00d710 \u22123 eV 2 and sin 2 \u03b823 in the range 0.38-0.65, both at the 68% confidence level, with two statistically-degenerate best fit points at sin 2 \u03b823 = 0.43 and 0.60.

            "text": "Neutrino oscillation is a powerful tool for probing fundamental neutrino properties [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10]. For the case of three-flavor mixing this process is governed by two independent mass-squared splittings, \u2206m 2 21 and \u2206m 2 32 , and the unitary mixing matrix U PMNS [11]. This matrix, which describes the linear combinations of neutrino mass eigenstates that constitute the neutrino flavor states, is parameterized by three angles \u03b8 13 , \u03b8 23 , and \u03b8 12 , and a CP-violating phase \u03b4 CP . \u03b8 23 has the largest measurement uncertainty of all mixing angles and is consistent with maximal mixing (\u03b8 23 = \u03c0/4) within current experimental uncertainties [6][7][8][9][10]. The observation of \u03bd \u00b5 disappearance, as reported here, is used to measure \u2206m 2 32 and sin 2 \u03b8 23 . Precise knowledge of \u03b8 23 is an input into future \u03bd e and \u03bd e appearance measurements that may determine whether \u03bd 1 or \u03bd 3 is the lightest mass eigenstate (normal or inverted mass hierarchy, respectively), whether \u03b8 23 > \u03c0/4 or \u03b8 23 < \u03c0/4, and whether neutrinos violate CP symmetry. This paper reports the first measurement by the NOvA experiment of sin 2 \u03b8 23 and \u2206m 2 32 via \u03bd \u00b5 disappearance. * Deceased.",

The generation of neutrino interactions in the NOvA detector and surrounding rock is performed using the GENIE simulation [19]. GENIE simulates the primary interaction inside the nucleus, the production of all final-state particles in the nucleus (hadronization), and the transport and rescattering of the final-state particles through the nucleus (intranuclear transport). For this analysis, three charged-current neutrino interaction types categorized by GENIE dominate the signal: quasielastic (QE), baryon resonance production (RES) and deep-inelastic scattering (DIS). The transport, energy loss, interactions and decays of final state particles within the detector volume are simulated by GEANT4. The GEANT4 simulation uses a description of the geometry and material content of the detectors. The simulated energy deposition in the liquid scintillator is converted to a corresponding number of photoelectrons observed in the APD using a model of light production, capture and propagation in the fiber that is based on test-stand measurements. This photoelectron signal is then converted to digitized quantities in the same format as data collected from the detectors using a model of the readout electronics response, also based on test-stand measurements.",

To ensure that the muon is contained, requirements are placed on the start and end positions of the primary track. In the ND, the forward projection of the track must be 4 or more cell-widths away from the edge of the detector and the backward projection of the track must be 8 or more cell-widths away from the detector edge. A more stringent projection requirement of 10 cells in both the forward and backward directions is applied in the FD, due to the larger cosmic-ray rate for the surface detector. To ensure that the energy resolution in the ND is comparable to the FD, an additional containment requirement is applied in which both the interaction vertex and all but 30 MeV of energy deposited in cells not associated with the selected muon must be upstream of the muon range stack.",
