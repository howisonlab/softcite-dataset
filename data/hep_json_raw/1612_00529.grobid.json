We use the full data sample of 772\u00d710 6 BB pairs recorded with the Belle detector at the KEKB electron-positron collider. Our results, P\u03c4 (D * ) = \u22120.38\u00b10.51(stat.) +0. 21 \u22120.16 (syst.) and R(D * ) = 0.270 \u00b1 0.035(stat.) +0.028 \u22120.025 (syst.), are consistent with the theoretical predictions of the Standard Model.",

            "text": "Semileptonic B decays to \u03c4 leptons (semitauonic decays) are theoretically well-studied processes within the Standard Model (SM) [1][2][3]. The presence of the massive \u03c4 lepton in the decay increases the sensitivity to new physics (NP) beyond the SM, such as an extended Higgs sector. A prominent candidate is the Two-Higgs-Doublet Model (2HDM) [4], as suggested, for example, in Refs. [5][6][7][8][9], for the decay processB \u2192 D ( * ) \u03c4 \u2212\u03bd \u03c4 [10]. The decaysB \u2192 D ( * ) \u03c4 \u2212\u03bd \u03c4 have been studied by the Belle [11][12][13][14], BaBar [15][16][17] and LHCb [18] experiments. Most of these studies have measured ratios of branching fractions, defined as R(D ( * ) ) = B(B \u2192 D ( * ) \u03c4 \u2212\u03bd \u03c4 )/B(B \u2192 D ( * ) \u2212\u03bd ). The denominator is the average of \u2212 = e \u2212 , \u00b5 \u2212 for Belle and BaBar, and \u2212 = \u00b5 \u2212 for LHCb. The ratio cancels numerous uncertainties common to the numerator and the denominator. The current averages of the three experiments [13,14,[16][17][18] are R(D) = 0.397 \u00b1 0.040 \u00b1 0.028 and R(D * ) = 0.316 \u00b1 0.016 \u00b1 0.010, which are 1.9 and 3.3 standard deviations (\u03c3) [19] away from the SM predictions of R(D) = 0.299 \u00b1 0.011 [20] or 0.300 \u00b1 0.008 [21] and R(D * ) = 0.252 \u00b1 0.003 [22], respectively. The overall discrepancy with the SM is about 4\u03c3. These tensions have been studied in the context of various NP models [22][23][24][25][26][27][28][29][30][31][32][33].",

For example, the type-II 2HDM allows P \u03c4 (D ( * ) ) to be between \u22120.6 (\u22120.7) and +1.0 [24,35]. A leptoquark model suggested in Ref. [27] with a leptoquark mass of 1 TeV/c 2 is possible to take P \u03c4 (D * ) between \u22120.5 and 0.0. The \u03c4 polarization can be measured in two-body hadronic \u03c4 decays with the differential decay rate [d\u0393(D ( * ) )/d cos \u03b8 hel ]/\u0393(D ( * ) ) = [1 + \u03b1P \u03c4 (D ( * ) ) cos \u03b8 hel ]/2, where \u03b8 hel is the angle of the \u03c4daughter meson momentum with respect to the direction opposite the W momentum in the rest frame of the \u03c4 (where W denotes the \u03c4 \u2212\u03bd \u03c4 system that corresponds to the virtual W boson from the B meson decay in the SM). The parameter \u03b1 describes the sensitivity to P \u03c4 (D ( * ) ) for each \u03c4 -decay mode; in particular, \u03b1 = 1 for \u03c4 \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03bd \u03c4 and \u03b1 = 0.45 for \u03c4 \u2212 \u2192 \u03c1 \u2212 \u03bd \u03c4 [36].
