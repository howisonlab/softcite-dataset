The data were collected by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC in 2012. Top squark candidates are searched for in events with either two hadronically decaying tau leptons, one hadronically decaying tau and one light lepton, or two light leptons. No significant excess over the Standard Model expectation is found. Exclusion limits at 95 % confidence level are set as a function of the top squark and scalar tau masses. Depending on the scalar tau mass, ranging from the 87 GeV LEP limit to the top squark mass, lower limits between 490 and 650 GeV are placed on the top squark mass within the model considered.",

Supersymmetry (SUSY) [5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13] is one such model which naturally resolves the hierarchy problem with the introduction of supersymmetric partners of the known bosons and fermions. A supersymmetric partner of the top quark would stabilise the Higgs boson mass against quadratically divergent quantum corrections, provided that its mass is close to the electroweak symmetry breaking energy scale. This would make its discovery possible at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) [14]. In a generic R-parity-conserving minimal supersymmetric extension of the SM (MSSM) [15][16][17][18][19], the scalar partners of right-handed and left-handed quarks,q R andq L , can mix, as can the scalar partners of charged leptons,\u02dc R and\u02dc L , to form two squark or two slepton mass eigenstates, respectively. The lighter of the two top squark eigenstates is denotedt 1 and is referred to as the scalar top in the following. Likewise, the lighter of the two scalar tau eigenstates is denoted\u03c4 1 and referred to herein as the scalar tau.",

            "text": "In gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking (GMSB) models [20][21][22][23][24][25], the spin-3/2 partner of the graviton, called the gravitinoG, is assumed to be the lightest supersymmetric particle. Assuming that the mass scale of the messengers responsible for the supersymmetry breaking is of the order of 10 TeV, in order to minimise fine tuning [26], the scalar top should be lighter than about 400 GeV [27]. If the scalar tau is lighter than the scalar top, and the supersymmetric partners of the gauge and Higgs bosons (charginos and neutralinos) are heavier, the dominant decay mode of thet 1 might be the three-body decay into b\u03bd \u03c4\u03c41 , where \u03bd \u03c4 is the tau neutrino, followed by the\u03c4 1 decay into a tau lepton and a gravitino. The other possible decay mode is the two-body decay into a top quark and a gravitino. The partial width of the two-body decay depends on the gravitino mass, while the partial width of the three-body decay via a virtual chargino depends on the chargino mass, as well as the chargino and scalar top mixing. For fixed scalar top and scalar tau masses either mode can dominate, and we focus in this paper on the signature result-ing from the three-body decay. The two-body decay would give a signature very similar to that of the decay into a top quark and a neutralino, which has been addressed in previous searches [28][29][30][31][32][33][34]. In the simplest gauge-mediated models, the predicted Higgs boson mass [35] is typically lower than the measured mass [36], especially if a light scalar top is also required. However, a variety of mechanisms exist [37][38][39][40][41] to raise the Higgs boson mass to make it compatible with the observed value.",

The decay topology of the signal process is shown in Fig. 1; the model considered is a simplified model in which all the supersymmetric particles other than the scalar top and the ones entering its decay chain are decoupled. In order to maximise the sensitivity, two distinct analyses have been performed based on the decay mode of the tau leptons in the final state: one analysis requires two hadronically decaying tau leptons (the hadron-hadron channel) and the other requires one hadronically decaying tau lepton and one tau decaying into an electron or muon, plus neutrinos (the lepton-hadron channel). In addition, the results of the search reported in Ref. [50], which is sensitive to events where both tau leptons decay leptonically (referred to as the lepton-lepton channel), are reinterpreted and limits are set on the scalar top and scalar tau masses.",

The calorimeter system covers the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 4.9. In the region |\u03b7| < 3.2, high-granularity liquid-argon electromagnetic sampling calorimeters are used. A steel/scintillatortile calorimeter provides energy measurements for hadrons within |\u03b7| < 1.7. The end-cap and forward regions, which cover the range 1.5 < |\u03b7| < 4.9, are instrumented with liquid-argon calorimeters for electromagnetic and hadronic particles. The muon spectrometer surrounds the calorimeters and consists of three large superconducting air-core toroid magnets, each with eight coils, a system of tracking chambers (covering |\u03b7| < 2.7) and fast trigger chambers (covering |\u03b7| < 2.4).",

The data are collected based on the decisions of a three-level trigger system [86]. Events are selected for the electron-hadron channel if they are accepted by a single-electron trigger, and for the muon-hadron channel if accepted by a single-muon trigger. For the hadron-hadron channel, a missing transverse momentum trigger is used. The trigger efficiency reaches its maximum value for leptons with a transverse momentum ( p T ) above 25 GeV in the lepton-hadron channels, and it exceeds 97 % for a missing transverse momentum above 150 GeV in the hadron-hadron channel. After beam, detector and data-quality requirements, the integrated luminosity of the data samples is 20.3 fb \u22121 in the electronhadron and muon-hadron channels, and 20.1 fb \u22121 [87] in the hadron-hadron channel. The difference in integrated luminosity is due to the additional data-quality requirements related to the trigger used in the hadron-hadron channel. 2 The mixing matrix of the simulated samples is such that the lightest scalar top eigenstate is almost a pure partner of the right-handed top quark.

An \u03b7and p Tdependent energy scale calibration is applied to correct for the detector response and subtract energy from pile-up interactions [99]. Tau lepton candidates are identified by using two boosted decision tree (BDT) algorithms that separate them from jets and electrons [99]. Variables describing the shower shape in the calorimeters and information from the tracking system are used to separate the collimated \u03c4 had decay products from the generally broader jets resulting from quark and gluon hadronisation. Variables such as the number of tracks or the fraction of the total tau energy contained in a cone of size R = 0.1 centred on the tau candidate provide strong discriminating power. To distinguish taus from electrons, the most discriminating characteristics are the transition radiation emitted by electrons in the TRT and the longer and wider shower generated by a hadronically decaying tau in the calorimeter compared with that produced by an electron. In addition to the two BDT selection criteria, a muon veto is applied. Hadronically decaying tau lepton candidates are required to have p T > 20 GeV, |\u03b7| < 2.47, and exactly one or three associated inner detector tracks (referred to as 1-prong and 3-prong candidates, respectively). The tau candidate is assigned an electric charge equal to the sum of the charges of the associated tracks, and this is required to be either +1 or \u22121. Three working points (loose, medium, and As a given final-state particle can be simultaneously reconstructed as (for example) an electron, a jet and a hadronically decaying tau lepton, an algorithm is used to resolve such ambiguities. Electrons satisfying the medium quality criteria, muons satisfying the criteria described above except that on isolation, jets and hadronically decaying tau candidates satisfying the selection criteria given above are considered by the algorithm. If two objects are close together in R, one of them is discarded according to the sequence specified in Table 2.

A set of single-jet triggers is used to select a sample of events with at least two jets (of which at least one is required to be a b-jet), and two \u03c4 had candidates. These events are required to have a low E miss T significance, 3 to retain topologies where jets and tau candidates are well-balanced in the transverse plane and suppress processes with genuine E miss T . The energy of jets and tau candidates is then smeared within the resolution of the calorimeter, in order to simulate E miss T arising from mis-measurements. To minimise the statistical uncertainty, no identification criteria are applied to \u03c4 had candidates beyond the 1,3-track requirement, and a fake rate is used at a later stage to account for the tau identification efficiency. The pseudo-dataset obtained after smearing serves as a template for the multi-jet background. Its normalisation is derived in a multi-jet-enriched CR, labelled CRHHQCD in Table 3. To estimate the background yield in the signal region, all SRHH requirements except the tau identification are applied to the normalised background template. A weight is then applied 3   Fig. 3 Background yields and composition after the fit in the two CRs and the two VRs of the hadron-hadron channel analysis. Combined statistical and systematic uncertainties are shown as shaded bands. The observed number of events and the total (constrained) background are the same by construction in the CRs to each event according to the probability for a jet reconstructed as a tau to satisfy the tight tau identification criteria. This fake rate is measured in data using events which fire a single-jet trigger, with at least two jets and a hadronically decaying tau candidate. It is found to be of the order of 1 % for 1-prong tau candidates and between 0.02 and 0.4 % (with a strong p T dependence) for 3-prong tau candidates.

The m T2 ( , \u03c4 had ) variable is bounded from above by the W boson mass for events where the light lepton, the hadronically decaying tau and the missing transverse momentum originate from the decay of a pair of W bosons, which is the case for most of the background (tt and W t). The high-mass selection requires this variable to be large, because its distribution for signal models with heavy scalar taus and scalar tops peaks at higher values than for the top-quark-dominated SM background. Another variable used in the selections is the ratio of the scalar sum of the transverse momenta of the two leading jets (H T ) to the effective mass, m eff = E miss T + H T + p T + p \u03c4 had T , where p T and p \u03c4 had T are the transverse momenta of the lepton and the hadronically decaying tau, respectively. This ratio, H T /m eff , tends to be smaller for signal events because of the high number of invisible particles in the final state, and it is required to be less than 0.5. The high-mass selection also requires the missing transverse momentum to be larger than 150 GeV and m eff to be larger than 400 GeV because the decay products of a high-mass scalar top would have large momenta. The low-mass selection requires ( p T + p \u03c4 had T )/m eff > 0.2 because the difference between the masses of the scalar top and scalar tau is relatively small in comparison to the difference between the masses of the top quark and the W boson. Finally, the m T ( , p miss T ) variable is used to distinguish events with real tau leptons from events with fake tau leptons in the dominant top-quark background, and to distinguish multi-jet events from W +jets events. The definitions of the low-mass and high-mass SRs are summarised in Tables 4 and 5, respectively. The signal selection efficiency of the low-mass selection is between 0.008 and 0.01 % for the models with a scalar top mass between 150 and 200 GeV, which is the target of this selection. The signal efficiency of the highmass selection increases with the scalar top mass. For a fixed scalar top mass, it increases with the scalar tau mass as the m T2 ( , \u03c4 had ) selection becomes more efficient, up to the region with m(t 1 )\u2212m(\u03c4 ) < 50 GeV where the b-jets become too soft to be efficiently detected. Outside this region, which is better targeted by the lepton-lepton channel, the efficiency of the high-mass selection varies between 0.0007 and 1 % for a scalar top mass between 200 and 700 GeV.",

In all cases, the difference in the predicted background or signal between the nominal MC simulation and that obtained after applying each systematic variation is used to determine the systematic uncertainty on the background or signal estimate. Parts of the systematic uncertainties cancel when a background is estimated from a control region, but they do not cancel for processes normalised to their theoretical cross section.

Scalar top candidates are searched for in events with either two hadronically decaying taus, one hadronically decaying tau and one light lepton, or two light leptons. Good agreement is observed between the Standard Model background estimate and the data. The first results from a hadron collider search for the three-body decay mode to the scalar tau are presented.

For tt events where the jet and the lepton belong to the decay of the same top quark, this variable is bounded from above by the top-quark mass. Similarly, for signal events, the upper bound on this variable is the scalar top mass. A maximum-value cut is therefore used in the low-mass selection and a minimum-value cut in the high-mass selection. The calculation of the variable requires the resolution of a two-fold ambiguity in the pairing of the jets and the leptons. Only the pairings for which m(b ) and m(b\u03c4 had ) are both smaller than m t are considered.4 If exactly one pairing satisfies the condition, that pairing is used in the m T2 calculation. If both pair-ings satisfy the condition, m T2 is calculated for both pairings and the smaller value is taken.

The system of one of the b-jets and the light lepton is considered as the first visible four-momentum. Only pairings for which m(b ) < m t are considered.

The invisible particle associated with this system is assumed to be massless. The other b-jet is the second visible system used in the m T2 calculation, and the mass of the associated invisible particle is set to the W boson mass, as the algorithm targets tt events where one lepton from a W boson decay is not detected or identified. For the dominant top-quark background, the m T2 (b , b) variable is bounded from above by the top-quark mass. This variable has a softer distribution for low-mass signal events than the background, and a maximum-value cut of 100 GeV is applied.The distributions for m T2 (b , b\u03c4 had ) and m T2 ( , \u03c4 had ) are illustrated inFig. 4after the preselection, showing the separation between two signal models and the SM background.
