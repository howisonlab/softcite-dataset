The nuclei recoiling from the scattering process are identified by the pulse shape of the scintillation light signals that they produce. The data are consistent with a no nuclear-recoil hypothesis, and WIMP-mass-dependent 90% confidence-level upper-limits are set on WIMP-nuclei elastic scattering cross sections. These limits partially exclude the DAMA/LIBRA allowed region for WIMP-sodium interactions with the same NaI(Tl) target material. The 90% confidence level upper limit on the WIMP-nucleon spin-independent cross section is 3.26\u00d710 \u22124 pb for a WIMP mass of 10 GeV/c 2 .",

            "text": "A number of astrophysical observations provide evidence that the dominant matter component of the universe is not ordinary matter, but rather non-baryonic dark matter [1,2]. Theoretically favored dark matter candidates are weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) [3], which were well motivated by supersymmetric models [4]. Many direct searches for WIMP dark matter in deep underground laboratories have been performed and failed to find evidence for a signal [5], with the notable exception of the DAMA experiment (including DAMA/NaI and DAMA/LIBRA) that has been operating for more than 20 years and has consistently reported a positive signal of annual modulation of event rates in Na(Tl) crystals [6][7][8][9], with a statistical significance of more than 9\u03c3 [9]. This significance has recently been strengthened with results from an additional six-year data exposure [10]. The DAMA signal has been interpreted as being due to WIMP-nucleon scattering in the context of the standard model for Milky Way galaxy's WIMP dark matter halo [11]. However, the inferred WIMP-nucleon cross sections in this case are in conflict with null observations from experiments that use different target materials [12][13][14][15]. Considering the high significance of the DAMA signal as well as the broad impact of a positive observation of WIMP dark matter, an independent verification of the DAMA signal using the same NaI(Tl) target material is required. A number of efforts with NaI target materials aimed at achieving this goal are in progress [16][17][18][19][20][21][22].",

Scintillation-light signals are read out by 76 mm Hamamatsu R12669 photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) that are optically coupled to each end of the cylinder. The assembled detector modules are installed in the shielding structure that was used for the KIMS CsI(Tl) detector measurements at the Yangyang Underground Laboratory (Y2L) [12,30,31]. The shield includes a 12-module array of low-background CsI(Tl) detectors situated inside of a shield that is comprised, from inside out, of 10 cm of copper, 5 cm of polyethylene, 15 cm of lead, and 30 cm of mineral oil to attenuate external radiation. Nitrogen gas was flushed through the detector setup to avoid radon contamination and maintain stable temperature and humidity levels.

This figure shows the background spectra of the crystals after the application of the event selection criteria described below. These background levels are lower than those of the crystals used by the NAIAD experiment [32], but higher than those of the DAMA/LIBRA crystals that are approximately 1 counts/day/kg/keV [33]. The higher background is primarily due to a larger contamination of 210 Pb and 40 K [19,25], which is also main cause of difference in background level between NaI1 and NaI2. Beside the internal contaminations, NaI1 has much higher cosmogenic activations due to different delivery method of air in NaI1 but sea in NaI2 [25]. Detailed background studies of these crystals are reported elsewhere [19,25,26].",

We used the small-sized crystal for the NR events to minimize multiple scattering events. Since a mean free path of 2.43 MeV neutron in the NaI crystal is about 10.82 cm [36], the multiple scattering probability of the neutron in the 1.5 cm thick crystal is negligible. Neutrons that scattered from the NaI(Tl) crystal were detected in neutron tagging counters containing BC501A liquid scintillator [37]. A time coincidence between signals from the target crystal and any one of the neutron detectors was used to select neutron scattering events. Neutron-induced signals in the tagging counters were distinguished from electron and gamma background-induced events by their pulse shapes. Details of neutron calibrations with similar arrangements are reported in elsewhere [27,35,38,39].",

The most important parameters reflect the differences between the \"slow\" (100-600 ns) and \"fast\" (0-50 ns) charge sums and the charge asymmetry between the two PMTs. A NR event from the WIMP interaction is expected to produce a hit in a single crystal, designated as a single-hit (SH) event, while events with accompanying hits in other surrounding NaI(Tl) or CsI(Tl) crystals are designated as multiple-hit (MH) events. The MH events are used to determine the selection efficiency and for modeling ER events. The efficiency determined with the MH events is greater than 90% in the ROI (2-8 keV). A sample of NR events from the neutron beam studies are used for an independent determination of the efficiency for NR events with results that are consistent with the determination with the ER events to within 3%.",

The averaged ER-induced waveform in NaI2 shows clearly slower rise-time than that in NaI-NR, but the similar decay-time as that seen in the smaller crystal. Figure 2(a) shows the averaged waveforms for ER-and NR-induced events with energies between 2 and 10 keV, where differences in the decay portion of the signals are evident. We can, therefore, use the LMT parameter to characterize the two different types of recoils. As summarized in table 2, the crystals used to produce the NR and SR calibration samples were different from those used for WIMP search measurements. Differences between the responses to ER-induced events for the WIMP-search crystal (NaI2) and the small crystal used to generate the NR calibration sample (NaI-NR) can be seen in figure 2(b). While the rise times in the two crystals are different, the decay portion of the waveforms in the two different-sized crystals are well matched. Light signals produced in larger crystals have longer light paths to the PMT and, thus, experience more photon absorption and reemission, and undergo more reflections, resulting in longer rise times [44,45]. On the other hand, these effects are small in comparison to the scintillation light decay time. Similar crystal-size effects on the LMT distribution are expected for the SR calibration sample.",

The limit, 3.26\u00d710 \u22124 pb for a WIMP mass at 10 GeV/c 2 , partially covers the DAMA 3\u03c3 region of WIMP-sodium interaction and demonstrates the feasibility of using PSD techniques for the direct extraction of WIMP-nucleon scattering from ongoing NaI(Tl) experiments such as COSINE-100 [53] and ANAIS-112 [54].",
