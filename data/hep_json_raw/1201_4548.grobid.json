            "text": "Due to the high centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV, the LHC has discovery potential for new heavy particles beyond the Tevatron limits even with little luminosity. This holds in particular for particles with colour charge, such as squarks and gluinos in supersymmetry (SUSY) [1]. However, due to the excellent luminosity performance of the LHC in 2011, sensitivity also exists for electroweak production of charginos and neutralinos, the supersymmetric partners of the electroweak gauge bosons and the Higgs boson. In this document, a number of results of ATLAS searches for supersymmetry with up to 2 fb \u22121 of LHC pp data at \u221a s = 7 TeV are summarized. Since none of the analyses have observed any excess above the Standard Model expectation, limits on SUSY parameters or masses of SUSY particles are set. It is, however, important to consider carefully the assumptions made in each of the limits, and the true constraints that they impose on supersymmetry.",

An important caveat in this interpretation is the fact that this is only true for neutralino LSP masses below approximately 250 GeV (as in MSUGRA/CMSSM for values of m 1/2 below O(600) GeV). For higher LSP masses, the squark and gluino mass limits are significantly less restraining. It will be a challenge for further analyses to extend the sensitivity of inclusive squark and gluino searches to the case of heavy neutralinos.

It is instructive to consider what such a motivation really requires from SUSY: a relatively light top quark partner (the stop,t) (and an associated sbottom-left quark,b L ), a gluino not much heavier than about 1.5 TeV to keep the stop light (the stop receives radiative corrections from loops liket \u2192gt \u2192t), and electroweak gauginos below the TeV scale [9]. There are no strong constraints on first and second generation squarks and sleptons; in fact heavy squarks and sleptons make it easier for SUSY to satisfy the strong constraints from flavour physics.

            "text": "The number of different final states sensitive to SUSY production is very large. SUSY particles may be long-lived, when their decay is suppressed kinematically (split SUSY, R-hadrons, anomaly-mediated SUSY breaking, certain parts of phase space of gauge-mediated SUSY breaking) or by very small couplings (e.g. R-parity violation). ATLAS has carried out searches for stable massive particles [17], for stopped gluinos [18], for kinked or disappearing tracks [19] and for secondary vertices of decaying massive particles [20]. Furthermore, there is a dedicated search for third generation sneutrinos decaying to an electron-muon pair in Rparity violation scenarios [21]. It is also noteworthy that ATLAS has searched for a scalar partner of the gluon [22]. Kinked or disappearing tracks are a possible signature of high-p T massive particles decaying in the detector volume to an almost degenerate daughter particle, such as \u03c7 \u00b1 1 \u2192\u03c7 0 1 \u03c0 \u00b1 in anomaly-mediated SUSY breaking (AMSB) models, where\u03c7 \u00b1 1 and\u03c7 0 1 are almost degenerate, and the resulting pion track has low p T and is easily missed in the reconstruction. ATLAS has searched for such signatures in 1.0 fb \u22121 of data [19], demanding a track p T of at least 10 GeV, good reconstruction quality in the silicon tracking detectors and in the inner layers of the transition radiation tracker (TRT), but no, or only few hits in the outer layer of the TRT. Backgrounds arise from tracks interacting with the TRT material (dominant), or from misreconstructed low-p T tracks. Figure 10 (top) shows probability density functions (pdfs) in p T for signal and background 09007-p.4 tracks; Figure 10 (bottom) shows the p T distribution of the 185 tracks in data satisfying the selection criteria, and the pdf fit to the data. The data is consistent with the background expectation, and upper limits on the signal are set. ATLAS has also searched for high-mass secondary vertices, consistent with the decay of massive particles, in 33 pb \u22121 of data collected in 2010. The analysis is designed in particular for the decay\u03c7 0 \u2192\u03bc\u00b5 and the R-parity violating decay\u03bc \u2192 qq \u2032 through a non-zero \u03bb \u2032 2i j coupling [20]. Backgrounds arise from interactions in the inner detector material, and the fiducial volume of this analysis excludes regions with such detector material. A signal region is defined requiring a vertex mass of 10 GeV or more, with at least four tracks in the vertex, as shown in Figure 11. The data is consistent with the background hypothesis.",
