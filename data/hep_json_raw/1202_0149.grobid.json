These measurements are useful to test the Standard Model (SM) at a new energy scale, to improve our knowledge on the proton composition. They are also sensitive to new physics. They are important background for many searches. As standard candles, they are useful to calibrate our detectors. Additionally, electroweak bosons are copiously produced in the collisions, being one of the most common processes, and their signal is considerably clean in the leptonic channels (especially in the Z boson case).",

These events are characterized by two high p T , isolated electrons or muons. The strategy in both experiments to select Z boson events is based on these characteristics, looking for energetic leptons (muons or electrons) not reconstructed within a jet. Quality criteria applied on the leptons are necessary to avoid bad reconstructions, bad p T measurements and to remove punch-through, cosmic rays and decays in flight. The invariant mass distribution for Z bosons decaying into two electrons after selection is shown in Fig. 1, in the ATLAS case. The distributions in the muon channel and in the CMS case are similar. W bosons decay into one electron (muon) plus an electronic neutrino (muonic neutrino) approx. 10% of the times per channel. In both cases we consider in the final state the existence of an energetic lepton (muon or electron) plus an imbalance of energy in the transverse plane (missing transverse energy, MET). The reconstruction of such a missing energy points generally to the existence of an undetected neutrino. The W boson signal is not as clean as the Z boson one due to the presence of the neutrino. Extra requirements are applied to remove backgrounds: quality criteria and electron p T (muon p T ) requirements (similar to the Z boson ones), Drell-Yan veto (removing events with two energetic leptons, to avoid Z bosons to be reconstructed as W bosons). In order to get a cleaner sample of W bosons, several studies require the transverse mass of the system lepton-neutrino, defined as:",

The W and Z boson inclusive cross section production through their decay into electrons are muons is the first electroweak measurement published by both experiments ( [3], [4]). It is measured by counting the number of events reconstructed as W or Z bosons for a certain luminosity and correcting for lepton reconstruction and identification efficiencies and detector acceptance. In the W boson case, the selection is optimized to get a reasonably clean sample consisting of more than 80% of signal in the Jacobian peak region. The analysis slightly differs in CMS and ATLAS in this measurement. ATLAS performs a more restrictive selection (removing events with low M T or low MET). In CMS a fit to the MET variable is used to extract the signal normalization. The Z boson case is easier since it is almost background free (less than 1%). The results published are presented in the form of total and fiducial cross sections and ratios of cross sections. This latter measurement is a more stringent test of the SM since many systematic uncertainties are removed or reduced when computing the ratios (e.g. the dominant luminosity uncertainty). The total systematic uncertainty (excluded luminosity) is of the order of 2% for both experiments. All the results are in agreement with the SM prediction. A summary of results published by CMS is shown in Fig. 2.",

            "text": "W and Z bosons are also studied in the tau decay mode. The W boson production cross section when decaying into \u03c4 and a \u03bd \u03c4 neutrino is measured by the ATLAS collaboration [5] (CMS [6] also published preliminary results). The properties of the tau jet (when the tau decays hadronically) are exploited to reconstruct these events. They select events with low multiplicity, high collimated jets or with non-zero flight distance using a boosted decision tree that includes all these properties. A clear W to tau signal is observed (more than 80% signal). The main difficulty in this analysis is the electroweak background (W boson decays into electrons and muons and Z boson leptonic decays) that amounts to some 13% and has a similar shape in the transverse mass as the signal (see Fig. 3). The cross section is measured with an approx. 23% systematic uncertainty and is compatible with the SM prediction. The Z boson signature in the tau channel is cleaner. It is studied in both CMS [8] and ATLAS [7] in four final states: \u03c4 \u00b5 \u03c4 \u00b5 , \u03c4 \u00b5 \u03c4 e , \u03c4 \u00b5 \u03c4 had , \u03c4 e \u03c4 had . The electroweak background is partially removed by inverting the M T and MET requirements. The \u03c4 l \u03c4 had channel is the one with the biggest branching ratio, but we have to cope with important backgrounds, mainly QCD multijet events. The \u03c4 e \u03c4 \u00b5 is the cleanest since no electroweak process can produce both leptons in the same event apart from the rare diboson processes. The \u03c4 \u00b5 \u03c4 \u00b5 is highly affected by the Z \u2192 \u00b5\u00b5 process. A boosted decision tree in 5 kinematic variables sensitive to the kinematical differences of muons from both processes is used by ATLAS. CMS uses a likelihood in 4 variables to separate signal and electroweak background. A competitive result is obtained after combining the results coming from the 4 final states (see Fig. 4). The total cross section is measured   Fig. 4. Z boson cross section production studied in the \u03c4 channel in the four final states: \u03c4 \u00b5 \u03c4 \u00b5 , \u03c4 \u00b5 \u03c4 e , \u03c4 \u00b5 \u03c4 had , \u03c4 e \u03c4 had and compared with the theoretical prediction (Gray band) and the cross section given in other leptonic decays (ATLAS).",

The Z boson production is studied in bins of the boson rapidity. The procedure for the cross section measurement is similar to that of the total inclusive production. Results for both muons and electrons, and the combination of them are presented by both collaborations. In CMS [9] and ATLAS [4] they exploit the use of the forward calorimeters to reconstruct electrons at high rapidities. In this region the resolution is worse but provides information for the PDFs in a new (Q 2x) region. The results are compatible with the expectations given by the reference MC in CMS and ATLAS. Systematic uncertainties range from 3% in the central region to 7% in the forward.   the theoretical predictions at NNLO. RESBOS in ATLAS and POWHEG [16]+PYTHIA Z2 in CMS also show discrepancies in the high p T region as can be seen in Fig. 7. Something similar happens for the W boson [12], where a general disagreement in the high p T region (more than 100 GeV) is observed in ATLAS. MCatNLO [18] and POWHEG+ PYTHIA give a prediction that differs by more than 20% in the high p T region with respect to data (giving the best prediction in the low domain). Despite the general disagreement shown in these studies, a similar trend is observed in the Z and W boson spectrum (see Fig. 8), supporting the universality of strong interactions effects in W and Z production. A better understanding of the p T spectrum is needed, for example, to achieve the precision required in future W mass measurements. W + and W \u2212 are not symmetrically produced in LHC collisions. At \u221a s = 7 TeV the expected ratio of W + over W \u2212 is roughly 1.4 and varies with the rapidity of the boson. The accessible variable in LHC experiments to test this asymmetry is the lepton charge asymmetry defined as:  Fig. 8.

Of special interest are the low p T and high p T regions of the spectrum. Low p T region uncertainties are dominated by nonperturbative QCD and the MC tuning. For the Z boson, in CMS [9] the official tune (PYTHIA [15] Z2) gives the best agreement data-MC. In ATLAS [11] RESBOS [17] is in optimal agreement (seeFig. 6). General disagreement is observed in the high p T region in both experiments with 06007-p.2",
