            "text": "To define the background model, we proceed as follows. First we estimate the number of multijet events that enter the final data sample. We use a data driven method [18] based on a superset of the final data sample obtained by removing the lepton isolation and p T requirements from the selection. At low p T this sample is dominated by multijet events and we can determine the ratio of the number of multijet background events with lepton candidates before and after applying the lepton isolation criteria. We determine the same ratio for leptons from simulated tt events. Using these two ratios and the ratio of events observed with the full selection before and after applying the lepton isolation criteria, we estimate the number of multijet events in the final data sample. We compute the number of multijet events in the e+jets and \u00b5+jets samples separately. We then subtract the number of multijet events and the expected number of events from all other backgrounds, except from W +jets production, from the number of data events and normalize the W +jets contribution to the remaining number of events. This corresponds to scaling the total number of W +jets events expected by a factor 1.3, which is consistent with NLO expectations. Table I summarizes the resulting composition of the data sample. To test for the presence of a t quark signal, we fix the relative normalizations of the W +jets, Z+jets, single top quark, and diboson backgrounds, as given in Table I, but float their overall normalization. To simulate the signal, we use t t production in pythia and force the decay t \u2192 W b. However, since we do not identify b jets in this analysis, our results are also applicable to t quarks decaying to a W boson and a light down-type quark. We generate events at 13 tmass values between 200 and 500 GeV. We set the total width of the t quark to 10 GeV. This is smaller than the resolution for reconstructing the t mass, which ranges between 50 GeV at m t = 200 GeV and 100 GeV at m t = 500 GeV. Therefore, the exact value of the width does not affect the analysis.",

            "text": "We define H T as the scalar sum of p T and of the transverse momenta of all jets and the charged lepton. A kinematic fit to the t t \u2192 \u03bdbqq b hypothesis reconstructs the mass m fit of the t quark. We use the two-dimensional histograms of H T versus m fit to test for the presence of signal in the data and to compute 95% C.L. upper limits on the t t production cross section as a function of tmass. Figure 1 shows the scatter plots observed in data and expected from t t production, tt production, and from all other background sources. For each hypothesized value of the t mass, we fit the data to background-only and to signal+background hypotheses. We then use the likelihood ratio L = \u22122 log(P S+B /P B ) as the test statistic, where P S+B is the Poisson likelihood to observe the data under the signal+background hypothesis and P B is the Poisson likelihood to observe the data under the background-only hypothesis. For the background-only hypothesis, we fit three components to the data: tt production constrained to its theoretical cross section, the multijets background constrained to the number of events given in Table I and W +jets and all other backgrounds in the proportions given in Table I. We add the t t cross section as a parameter to the signal+background fit. The fit can discriminate between background and signal contributions because their distributions in the H T and m fit variables are different. For each hypothesis we also vary the systematic uncertainties given in Table II subject to a Gaussian constraint to their prior values to maximize the likelihood ratio [19]. We use the CL s method [20] to determine the cross section limits. Using pseudoexperiments, we determine the probability to measure values of L that are larger than the value observed in the data sample for a t signal, CL s+b , and for no t signal, CL b . The value of the t pair production cross section for which 1\u2212CL s+b /CL b = 0.95 is the 95% C.L. upper limit. We repeat this procedure for each t mass point. Table II summarizes the sources of systematic uncertainties included in the limit calculation. The first four uncertainties affect the normalization of the components of our signal and background models. All other uncertainties affect the selection efficiency. When estimating the effect of uncertainties in the jet energy scale, the jet identification efficiency, and the jet energy resolution, we also vary the shapes of the H T and m fit distributions. No uncertainties are given for the W +jets background because its normalization is a free parameter of the fit. We first analyze the e+jets and \u00b5+jets data separately. Figure 2 shows the distributions of H T and m fit from the standard model backgrounds and a 325 GeV t quark signal compared to data. There is no excess in the e+jets data. In the \u00b5+jets data we observe a small excess of events over standard model expectations. We can fit the data best with a t t production cross section of 3.2 \u00b1 1.1 times the theoretical cross section for a t quark mass of 325 GeV. The value of 1 \u2212 CL b for the data gives the probability of getting a local deviation of at least this size from the standard model expectation in the absence of physics beyond the standard model. We find a p value of 0.007, corresponding to 2.5 Gaussian-equivalent standard deviations. Figure 3 shows the resulting cross section limits compared to the limits expected in the absence of t t production and to the predicted NLO t pair production cross section [21] as a function of the t mass. We expect to be able to exclude t t production for t quark masses below 315 GeV in the e+jets channel and below 280 GeV in the \u00b5+jets channel. The observed cross section limit allows us to exclude t t production for t quark masses at the 95% C.L. below 295 GeV in the e+jets channel and below 225 GeV in the \u00b5+jets channel. Combining e+jets and \u00b5+jets data as shown in Fig. 4, we expect to exclude t t production for t quark mass values below 320 GeV. Based on the observed limits we can exclude at the 95% C.L. t t production for t quark masses below 285 GeV. We achieve the best fit to the data with a t t production cross section of 1.1 \u00b1 0.5 times the theoretical cross section for a t quark mass of 325 GeV which gives a p value of 0.015, corresponding to 2.2 standard deviations from zero. In conclusion, we searched for pair production of a t quark and its antiparticle followed by their decays into a W boson and a jet. We do not see a signal consistent with t t production, although we observe a small excess of events in the \u00b5+jets channel. Combining the e+jets and \u00b5+jets channels and under the assumption that the branching fraction B(t \u2192 W q) = 100%, we exclude at 95% C.L. t t production for t quark mass values below 285 GeV.",
