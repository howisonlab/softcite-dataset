            "text": "Heavy quarks are a unique probe to study the medium produced in ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions. The dominant process of charm quark production at RHIC is believed to be initial gluon fusion which can be calculated in the perturbative QCD. The upper limit of FONLL calculation seems to be in good agreement with charm cross section measurements at mid-rapidity in p + p collisions at \u221a s NN = 200 GeV provided by STAR. The same measurement in Au+Au collisions at equal energy reveals the numberof-binary-collisions scaling of charm cross section indicating that charm production is dominated by initial hard scatterings. In this article, we report the measurements of D 0 , D * in p + p at 0.6 GeV/c < p T < 6 GeV/c and D 0 in Au+Au collisions at 0.2 GeV/c < p T < 5 GeV/c via hadronic decays",

            "text": "The charm quark production is dominated by initial gluon fusion at initial hard partonic collisions and well described by perturbative QCD (pQCD) because of large charm quark mass (\u223c 1.5 GeV/c 2 ) [1]. The mass is almost exclusively generated through its coupling to the Higgs field in the electroweak sector, while masses of (u, d, s) quarks are dominated by spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry (CS) in QCD [2]. This means that charm quarks remain heavy even if CS is restored, as it likely is in a QGP. Since charm is produced mainly in initial hard scatterings, one expects that charm production total cross section \u03c3 NN cc should scale as a function of number-of-binary-collisions N bin . In addition, if charm quarks flow elliptically, there must have been enough interactions to easily thermalize light quarks. Hence, charm quarks are an ideal probe to study early dynamics in high-energy nuclear collisions.",

This results in a large combinatorial background which was reconstructed via mixed-event method (Au+Au dataset), same-charge-sign, and kaon momentumrotation (p+p dataset) and subtracted from invariant mass spectra of daughter particle pairs [5]. To reconstruct D * , one may exploit the softness of D * \u2192 D 0 \u03c0 decay; combine low momentum pions with D 0 candidates, i.e. pairs with 1.82 < M(K\u03c0) < 1.9 GeV/c, and plot difference M(K\u03c0\u03c0) \u2212 M(K\u03c0). Such value occupies the beginning of the phase space; hence it does not suffer from large combinatorial background making D * direct observation possible. The combinatorial background was reconstructed by side-band (picking D 0 candidates outside the D 0 mass region) and wrong-sign (picking soft pion with opposite charge) methods. The difference between these methods is the dominant source of systematic uncertainties for both D 0 and D * analyses.",

Then the invariant charm cross section d\u03c3 cc p+p /(2\u03c0p T dp T dy) was calculated by formula in each p T bin (\u03c3 NSD is non-single diffractive p+p inelastic cross section, f frag. is the ratio of charm quarks hadronized to open charm mesons and T is the trigger bias correction). The charm cross section at mid rapidity d\u03c3 cc /dy was obtained from power-law function fit to d\u03c3 cc /(2\u03c0p T dp T dy) points (see Fig. 3) as 170 \u00b1 45(stat.) +37 \u221251 (sys.) \u00b5b. In Au+Au collisions we calculated invariant yield d 2 N/(N ev p T dp T dy). The d\u03c3 cc /dy at mid-rapidity in Au+Au collisions was extracted, from a power-law fit as 186\u00b122(stat.)\u00b130(sys.)\u00b1 18(norm.) \u00b5b assuming that the f frag. does not change from p+p to Au+Au collisions. The charm cross section for three centrality bins, 0-20%, 20-50% and 50-80%, is obtained according to the integrated yields. The charm production cross section per nucleon-nucleon collision at mid-rapidity as a function of N bin is shown in the right panel of Fig.  3. Within errors, the results are in agreement and follow the number of binary collisions scaling, which indicates that charm quark is produced via initial hard scatterings at early stage of the collisions at RHIC. The FONLL (orange band) and NLO [6] (light-blue band) uncertainties are also shown here for comparison.",
