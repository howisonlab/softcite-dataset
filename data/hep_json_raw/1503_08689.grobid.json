Differential cross sections are measured as a function of \u03be X \u00bc M 2 X =s in the region \u22125.5 < log 10 \u03be X < \u22122.5, for log 10 M Y < 0.5, dominated by single dissociation (SD), and 0.5 < log 10 M Y < 1.1, dominated by double dissociation (DD), where M X and M Y are given in GeV. The inclusive pp cross section is also measured as a function of the width of the central pseudorapidity gap \u0394\u03b7 for \u0394\u03b7 > 3, log 10 M X > 1.1, and log 10 M Y > 1.1, a region dominated by DD. The cross sections integrated over these regions are found to be, respectively, 2.99 AE 0.02\u00f0stat\u00de \u00fe0.32 \u22120.29 \u00f0syst\u00de mb, 1.18 AE 0.02\u00f0stat\u00de AE 0.13\u00f0syst\u00de mb, and 0.58 AE 0.01\u00f0stat\u00de \u00fe0.13   \u22120.11 \u00f0syst\u00de mb, and are used to extract extrapolated total SD and DD cross sections. In addition, the inclusive differential cross section, d\u03c3=d\u0394\u03b7 F , for events with a pseudorapidity gap adjacent to the edge of the detector, is measured over \u0394\u03b7 F \u00bc 8.4 units of pseudorapidity. The results are compared to those of other experiments and to theoretical predictions and found compatible with slowly rising diffractive cross sections as a function of center-of-mass energy.",

            "text": "Inclusive diffractive cross sections cannot be calculated within perturbative quantum chromodynamics and are commonly described by models based on Regge theory (see e.g. [1] and references therein). The predictions of these models generally differ when extrapolated from the Tevatron center-of-mass energies of ffiffi ffi s p \u2264 1.96 TeV to LHC energies. Therefore, measurements of diffractive cross sections at 7 TeV provide a valuable input for understanding diffraction and improving its theoretical description. They are also crucial for the proper modeling of the full final state of hadronic interactions in event generators, and can help to improve the simulation of the underlying event, as well as of the total inelastic cross section. The DD cross section has been recently measured at ffiffi ffi s p \u00bc 7 TeV by the TOTEM Collaboration [2], for events in which both dissociated-proton masses are below \u223c12 GeV. Other measurements of diffractive cross sections at the LHC, with higher dissociation masses, have either a limited precision [3] or no separation between SD and DD events [4]. In this paper, we present the first CMS measurement of inclusive diffractive cross sections at ffiffi ffi s p \u00bc 7 TeV. This measurement is based on the presence of a forward LRG, with SD-and DD-dominated event samples separated by using the CASTOR calorimeter [5], covering the very forward region, \u22126.6 < \u03b7 < \u22125.2. A data sample with a central LRG, in which DD dominates, is also used. In addition, the inclusive differential cross section, d\u03c3=d\u0394\u03b7 F , for events with a pseudorapidity gap adjacent to the edge of the detector, is measured over \u0394\u03b7 F \u00bc 8.4 units of pseudorapidity, and compared to a similar ATLAS measurement [4]. The results presented here are based on the first CMS data collected at ffiffi ffi s p \u00bc 7 TeV during the 2010 LHC commissioning period, when the probability of overlapping pp interactions in the same bunch crossing (pileup), which may spoil the detection of the gap, was low. The paper is organized into 11 sections and two appendices. The CMS detector is described in Sec. II. Section III presents the Monte Carlo (MC) simulations used in the analysis. The event selection and the diffractive event topologies used to measure the cross sections are discussed in Secs. IV and V, respectively. Sections VI, VII, and VIII present the measurement of the forward-gap and centralgap differential cross sections, and the integrated cross sections, respectively. All cross sections are extracted within the detector acceptance and with minimal modeldependent systematic uncertainties. The extrapolation of the measured cross sections to the low-mass regions is discussed in Sec. IX. Section X presents the measurement of the pseudorapidity gap cross section and its comparison to the ATLAS result [4]. The systematic uncertainties for all the measurements are discussed in Sec. XI. A summary is given in Sec. XII. Appendixes A and B present additional comparisons between the diffractive MC models used.",

The forward component of the hadron calorimeter, HF (2.9 < j\u03b7j < 5.2), consists of steel absorbers with embedded radiation-hard quartz fibers, providing fast collection of Cherenkov light. The very forward angles are covered at one end of CMS (\u22126.6 < \u03b7 < \u22125.2) by the CASTOR calorimeter [5], made of quartz plates embedded in tungsten absorbers, segmented in 16 \u03d5 sectors and 14 z modules.",

We use PYTHIA 8.165 [7,8] to generate samples of inelastic events. We compare the detector-level data distributions to the PYTHIA 8 4C [8] and PYTHIA 8 MBR (minimum bias Rockefeller) [9] simulations and extract integrated cross sections using PYTHIA 8 MBR. Diffractive events in the PYTHIA 8 4C simulation are generated according to the Schuler-Sj\u00f6strand model implemented in PYTHIA 6 [7]. The 4C tune [8]  The PYTHIA 8 MBR generator predicts the energy dependence of the total, elastic, and inelastic pp cross sections, and fully simulates the main diffractive components of the inelastic cross section: SD, DD and CD. The diffractive-event generation in PYTHIA 8 MBR is based on a phenomenological renormalized-Regge-theory model [10,11], which is unitarized by interpreting the Pomeron flux as the probability for forming a diffractive rapidity gap. The model was originally developed for the CDF experiment at the Tevatron and has been successfully tested with the CDF results on diffraction. The PYTHIA 8 MBR simulation assumes a linear parametrization of the Pomeron trajectory, \u03b1\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc 1 \u00fe \u03b5 \u00fe \u03b1 0 t, where t is the square of the four-momentum transfer between the two incident protons. We use \u03b1 0 \u00bc 0.25 GeV \u22122 , and \u03b5 \u00bc 0.08 [12,13] or \u03b5 \u00bc 0.104 [14,15], to account for the possible energy dependence of \u03b5 in the range of diffractive masses accessible in this analysis. We find that the simulation with \u03b5 \u00bc 0.08 gives a good description of the data. Scaling the DD cross section downwards by 15%, which preserves the agreement with the CDF data, further improves the description of the DD-dominated data at ffiffi ffi s p \u00bc 7 TeV.",

At the stable-particle level (where stable particles are those with lifetime \u03c4 such that c\u03c4 > 10 mm), the kinematic regions covered by the present measurements are defined by the masses M X and M Y of the two final-state hadronic systems separated by the largest rapidity gap in the event. For a final-state particle of energy E and longitudinal momentum p z , rapidity is defined as y \u00bc \u00f01=2\u00de ln\u00bd\u00f0E \u00fe p z \u00de=\u00f0E \u2212 p z \u00de. At stable-particle level the gap is defined as the largest rapidity separation between stable particles, without any acceptance restriction. The final state is then separated into systems X and Y, which populate the regions on the positive and negative side of the rapidity gap, respectively. The corresponding masses M X and M Y are calculated from the full set of four-vectors in the respective group of stable particles. In the following sections, M X and M Y are given in units of GeV.  . Detector-level distributions of the energy of PF objects in four pseudorapidity intervals: j\u03b7 PF j < 1.4, 1.4 < j\u03b7 PF j < 2.6, 2.6 < j\u03b7 PF j < 3.2, and j\u03b7 PF j > 3.2, corresponding to the barrel, end-cap, end-cap-forward transition, and forward detector regions (columns), for five particle candidate types: charged hadrons (tracks), photons, neutral hadrons, and two types that yield electromagnetic or hadronic energy deposits in HF (rows). Electron and muon candidates constitute less than 0.1% of the PF objects reconstructed in the j\u03b7 PF j < 2.6 region, and are not shown. The data are compared to the predictions of the PYTHIA 8 MBR simulation, normalized to the integrated luminosity of the data sample. The contribution of each of the generated processes is shown separately.",

            "text": "Offline selections [24] are applied to remove beamscraping, beam-halo, and noise events. In addition, a minimal activity in the main CMS detectors is imposed offline by requiring at least two particle-flow (PF) objects reconstructed within the geometrical acceptance of the BSC detectors (3.23 < j\u03b7j < 4.65, with an energy of at least 4 GeV for each PF object). Particle-flow objects [25,26] are particle candidates obtained by optimally combining the information from the tracking system and the calorimeters. In the forward regions (j\u03b7j > 2.5), where there is no tracking, PF objects reduce to calorimeter towers. Figure 2 shows the distributions of the energy of the PF objects reconstructed in different detector regions for different particle candidates, compared to the prediction of the PYTHIA 8 MBR simulation, which describes the data well. The requirement on the minimum energy of PF objects was found by studying data collected in dedicated runs with no beam; it depends on the detector region and the particle candidates and varies from zero for tracks to 4 GeV for the HF towers. To assure a reliable Monte Carlo description of the data, the two innermost (most forward) rings of HF are not used in the analysis, thus limiting the central CMS detector coverage to j\u03b7j \u2272 4.7. The two outermost (most central) HF rings are also not used for the same reason. No vertex requirement is imposed. This procedure gives high acceptance for diffractive events with the hadronic system outside the tracking acceptance (i.e., with low to moderate diffractive masses, 12 \u2272 M X \u2272 100 GeV). According to the PYTHIA 8 MBR simulation, the selection described above accepts about 90% of the events corresponding to the total inelastic cross section in the region of log 10 M X > 1.1 or log 10 M Y > 1.1.",

The experimental topology with a forward pseudorapidity gap on each edge of the detector [CD topology, Fig. 1(d)] is neglected in this analysis because of the limited number of such events. For the FG1 and FG2 topologies the pseudorapidity gap is related to the variables \u03b7 max and \u03b7 min (Fig. 3), defined as the highest (lowest) \u03b7 of the PF object reconstructed in the central detector. Experimentally, the pseudorapidity gap in CG events may be expressed as \u0394\u03b7 0 \u00bc \u03b7 0 max \u2212 \u03b7 0 min , where \u03b7 0 max (\u03b7 0 min ) is the closest-to-zero \u03b7 value of the PF objects reconstructed on the positive (negative) \u03b7 side of the central detector (Fig. 3). Figure 4 shows the distributions of \u03b7 max , \u03b7 min , and \u0394\u03b7 0 \u00bc \u03b7 0 max \u2212 \u03b7 0 min for the minimum bias sample defined in Sec. IV, compared to MC predictions. For the \u0394\u03b7 0 selection, the additional requirement that activity be present on both \u03b7 sides of the central detector is imposed. The data are dominated by the contribution from ND events, for which rapidity gaps are exponentially suppressed [27]. Diffractive events appear as a flattening of the exponential distributions, and dominate the regions of low \u03b7 max , high \u03b7 min , and high \u0394\u03b7 0 . The absence of events around j\u03b7 max j\u00f0j\u03b7 min j\u00de \u2248 3 in Figs. 4(a) and 4(b) reflects the fact that the two outermost (most central) rings of HF are not used in the analysis; the depletion of events around j\u03b7 max j\u00f0j\u03b7 min j\u00de \u2248 2.4 corresponds to the transition region between the tracker and the forward calorimeters, where higher thresholds are applied for the latter. The regions of 3 \u2272 \u0394\u03b7 0 \u2272 6 and \u0394\u03b7 0 \u2273 6 in Fig. 4(c) correspond to the DD topology for which one or both of the \u03b7 0 max and \u03b7 0 min edges are in the HF calorimeters. In order to select samples of FG1, FG2, and CG events with a central LRG signature, the requirements \u03b7 max < 1, \u03b7 min > \u22121, and \u0394\u03b7 0 > 3 are imposed, respectively.",

Figure 8(a) shows the comparison for the entire FG2 sample. The separation of the SD and DD processes (hatched green and solid yellow histograms, respectively) by means of the CASTOR tag is clearly seen in Figs. 8(b) and 8(c). Overall, the PYTHIA 8 MBR MC describes the data better than PYTHIA 8 4C and is therefore used to extract the diffractive cross sections. Both MC predictions are presented for a Pomeron trajectory with \u03b5 \u00bc 0.08 and describe the region of low \u03be X well. At higher \u03be X values, \u03b5 \u00bc 0.104 would be more appropriate [14], providing a better agreement with the data in that region. Since the M X dependence of \u03b5 is currently not available in the MC models used for this analysis, we extract cross sections using \u03b5 \u00bc 0.08 and evaluate a systematic uncertainty related to the possible variation of \u03b5, as explained in Sec.

The number of iterations is optimized following the procedure suggested in Ref. [28], by studying the difference in \u03c7 2 (goodness-of-fit) values after consecutive iterations; the final unfolded distribution, folded back to the detector level, is consistent with the observed data. The response matrix is obtained with PYTHIA 8 MBR (\u03b5 \u00bc 0.08). The results are presented in Table I; they include a small correction for overlapping pp collisions (\u223c7%), evaluated by comparing MC simulations with and without pileup. Figures 9(a,c) present the measured cross sections compared to the PYTHIA 8 MBR, PYTHIA 8 4C, and PYTHIA 6 Z2* predictions. The error bars of the data points are dominated by systematic uncertainties, which are discussed in Sec. XI. The predictions of PYTHIA 8 MBR are shown for two values of the \u03b5 parameter of the Pomeron trajectory. Both values, \u03b5 \u00bc 0.08 and \u03b5 \u00bc 0.104, describe the measured cross section for log 10 M Y < 0.5. The data for 0.5 < log 10 M Y < 1.1 favor the smaller value of \u03b5, specifically in the region of lower \u03be X , corresponding to the topology in which both dissociation masses are low. The prediction of the Schuler-Sj\u00f6strand model, used in the PYTHIA 8 4C simulation, describes well the measured cross section for 0.5 < log 10 M Y < 1.1, while the PYTHIA 6 Z2* simulation overestimates it. Both predictions are higher than the data for log 10 M Y < 0.5 at high log 10 \u03be X , and the predicted rising behavior of the cross section is not confirmed by the data in the region of the measurement, \u22125.5 < log 10 \u03be X < \u22122.5.

            "text": "The measurements based on the central CMS detector are insensitive to the low-mass part of diffractive dissociation. Therefore, in order to compare the measured \u03c3 SDvis cross section with results of other experiments and theoretical models that present integrated cross sections for \u03be < 0.05, an extrapolation from \u22125.5 < log 10 \u03be X < \u22122.5 (\u03be X \u00bc M 2 X =s) to \u03be < 0.05 is required. Similarly, the \u03c3 DDvis cross section must be extrapolated to \u0394\u03b7 > 3 (Fig. 6). The extrapolation factors, calculated by using each of the MC simulations introduced in Sec. III, are presented in Appendix A. Not all of the simulations are able to describe the measured cross sections (see Sec. VIII), nor do they include realistic hadronization models (see Appendix B). Following the discussion in Sec. VIII and Appendix B, the extrapolation factors are determined with PYTHIA 8 MBR (with \u03b5 \u00bc 0.08), which describes well all aspects of our data. The multiplicative factor needed to extrapolate the measured SD cross section to \u03be < 0.05 is f SD MBR \u00bc 2.18 \u00fe13% \u22124% , and that for the extrapolation of the DD cross section to \u0394\u03b7 > 3 is f DD MBR \u00bc 1.92 \u00fe31% \u221210% (Tables VI and VII in Appendix A). The extrapolation uncertainties are estimated by changing the parameters \u03b1 0 and \u03b5 of the Pomeron trajectory from their nominal values (\u03b1 0 \u00bc 0.25 GeV \u22122 , \u03b5 \u00bc 0.08) to those presented in Tables VI and VII (one parameter changed at a time), and adding in quadrature the corresponding deviations with respect to the central result,  Figure 12(a) presents the extrapolated SD cross section compared to the ALICE result [3] and a compilation of lower center-of-mass energy measurements [31][32][33][34][35]. The data are also compared to the PYTHIA 8 MBR simulation, as well as to the GLM [36] and KP [37,38] models. The CMS result is consistent with a SD cross section weakly rising with energy. Figure 12(b) shows the extrapolated DD cross section compared to the ALICE results [3], those by CDF at ffiffi ffi s p \u00bc 630 GeV and 1.8 TeV [39], as well as the PYTHIA 8 MBR, GLM [36], and KP [37,38] models. The CMS measurement at ffiffi ffi s p \u00bc 7 TeV is in agreement with the ALICE measurement at the same energy. Note, however, that the ALICE result is obtained from the NSD (non-single-diffractive \u00bc DD \u00fe ND) data, while for the CMS measurement the ND background has been subtracted. Here as well, the data are consistent with a weakly rising cross section with energy, as predicted by the models. Table IV presents the summary of the cross section measurements illustrated in the previous sections, together with the kinematic region covered by each measurement. The method used for the cross section extraction (LRG or MBR) is given as well. The \u03c3 no-CASTOR , \u03c3 CASTOR , and \u03c3 CG cross sections are measured from all the events passing the LRG selection (Sec. VIII). The \u03c3 SDvis , \u03c3 DDvis CASTOR , and \u03c3 DDvis CG cross sections are extracted from the latter ones by subtracting the background contribution from other processes as predicted by the PYTHIA 8 MBR simulation (Sec. IX). In addition, \u03c3 DDvis is calculated from the combination of \u03c3 DDvis CASTOR and \u03c3 DDvis CG . Finally, the \u03c3 SD and \u03c3 DD cross sections (Sec. IX A) are calculated by extrapolating \u03c3 SDvis and \u03c3 DDvis to the region of lower diffractive masses using the mass dependence of the cross section predicted by PYTHIA 8 MBR.",

The migration corrections are evaluated with the iterative Bayesian unfolding technique [28], as implemented in the ROOUNFOLD package [29], with a single iteration. The response matrix is obtained with PYTHIA 8 MBR (\u03b5 \u00bc 0.08). The cross section is measured only for \u0394\u03b7 F < 8.4, so as to avoid regions where the trigger inefficiency and the unfolding uncertainty are large.

Figures 17 and 18 show the charged-particle multiplicity distributions and p T spectra for the SD process for three ranges of M X : 5.6 < M X < 10 GeV, 32 < M X < 56 GeV, and 178 < M X < 316 GeV, for the PYTHIA 8 MBR, PYTHIA 8 4C, PYTHIA 6 Z2*, PHOJET, QGSJET-II 03, QGSJET-II 04, and EPOS simulations, compared to the reference model quoted above. The following conclusions can be drawn: PYTHIA 6 Z2*, QGSJET-II 03, QGSJET-II 04, and EPOS predict smaller multiplicities and harder p T spectra than the model of Ref. [41,46]; PYTHIA 8 4C agrees with the mean values of the multiplicity distributions, but predicts narrower widths, and harder p T spectra; PHOJET predicts multiplicity distributions consistent with the reference model with harder p T spectra; and PYTHIA 8 MBR agrees with the reference model in both multiplicity and p T spectra. The latter is an expected result, as the hadronization parameters of the PYTHIA 8 MBR simulation have been tuned to follow the reference model. and f SD MBR \u00bc \u03c3 SD i \u00f0\u03be < 0.05\u00de=\u03c3 SD;vis MBR from the visible to total SD (\u03be < 0.05) cross section for each MC model considered (i \u00bc 1-10).
