The analysis is performed on events containing one isolated electron or muon, large missing transverse momentum and exactly two b-tagged jets in the final state. The analysed data set corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb \u22121 . The signal is extracted using a maximum-likelihood fit of a discriminant which is based on the matrix element method and optimized in order to separate single-top-quark s-channel events from the main background contributions, which are top-quark pair production and W boson production in association with heavy-flavour jets. The measurement leads to an observed signal significance of 3.2 standard deviations and a measured cross-section of \u03c3 s = 4.8 \u00b1 0.8(stat.) +1.6    \u22121.3 (syst.) pb, which is consistent with the Standard Model expectation. The expected significance for the analysis is 3.9 standard deviations.",

            "text": "In proton-proton (pp) collisions, top quarks are produced mainly in pairs via the strong interaction, but also singly via the electroweak interaction through a Wtb vertex. Therefore, single top-quark production provides a powerful probe for the electroweak couplings of the top quark. In the Standard Model (SM), three different production mechanisms are possible in leadingorder (LO) QCD: an exchange of a virtual W boson either in the t-channel or in the s-channel (see Fig. 1), or the associated production of a top quark and a W boson. Among other interesting features, s-channel single top-quark production is sensitive to new particles proposed in several models of physics beyond the SM, such as charged Higgs boson or W boson production [1]. It also plays an important role in indirect searches for new phenomena that could be modelled as anomalous couplings in an effective quantum field theory [2]. Furthermore, s-channel production, like the other two production channels, provides a direct determination of the absolute value of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix element V tb .",

At LO the final state contains two jets with large transverse momenta: one jet originating from the decay of the top quark into a b-quark (\"b-jet\"), and another b-jet from the Wtb vertex producing the top quark. Thus the experimental signature consists of an isolated electron or muon, large missing transverse momentum, E miss T , due to the undetected neutrino from the W boson decay, and two jets with large transverse momentum, p T , and which are both identified as containing b-hadrons (\"b-tagged\"). The electron and muon channels in this analysis are merged regardless of the lepton charge in order to measure the combined production crosssection of top quarks and top antiquarks.",

The same data set is used in both analyses. This analysis takes advantage of enhanced simulation samples which reduce the statistical uncertainty and give a better description of the data. Furthermore, updated calibrations for the 2012 data are used, resulting in a reduction of systematic uncertainties. The event selection is improved by adding a veto on dileptonic events, which leads to a significant suppression of the background for top-quark pair (tt) production (see Section 5). The combination of all these measures results in a significant improvement in the sensitivity to the s-channel process. Approximately half of this improvement can be attributed to the change in method from BDT to ME. In particular, the BDT technique applied to this analysis is limited by the sample sizes available for the training, while the ME approach is not sensitive to this limitation.",

The selected events consist either of an electron or muon, two jets, both of which are identified to be induced by a b-quark, and large E miss T . In order to separate the signal from the large background contributions, a matrix element method discriminant is used. The signal is extracted from the data utilizing a profile likelihood fit, which leads to a measured cross-section of 4.8 +1.8 \u22121.6 pb. The result, which is in agreement with the SM prediction, corresponds to an observed significance of 3.2 standard deviations, while the expected significance of the analysis is 3.9 standard deviations.",
