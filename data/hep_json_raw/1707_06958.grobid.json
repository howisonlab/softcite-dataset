The search uses 36.1 fb-1 of proton-proton collision data at s = 13 TeV collected by the ATLAS detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider in 2015 and 2016. The data are in agreement with the Standard Model expectations, with the largest excess found at a resonance mass of 3.0 TeV with a local (global) significance of 3.3 (2.1) \u03c3 . The results are presented in terms of constraints on a simplified model with a heavy vector triplet. Upper limits are set on the production cross-section times branching ratio for resonances decaying to a W (Z ) boson and a Higgs boson, itself decaying to bb\u00af, in the mass range between 1.",

            "text": "The discovery of the Higgs boson [1,2] confirms the validity of the Standard Model (SM) in the description of particle inter actions at energies up to a few hundred GeV. However, radiative corrections to the Higgs boson mass drive its value to the model's validity limit, indicating either extreme fine-tuning or the presence of new physics at an energy scale not far above the Higgs boson mass. It is natural to expect such new physics to manifest itself through significant coupling to the Higgs boson, for example in decays of new particles to a Higgs boson and other SM particles. This Letter presents a search for resonances produced in 36.1 fb-1 of proton-proton ( pp) collision data at s = 13 TeV which decay to a W or Z boson and a Higgs boson. Such resonances are pre dicted in multiple models of physics beyond the SM, e.g. composite Higgs [3,4] or Little Higgs [5] models, or models with extra dimen sions [6,7].",

The new heavy vector bosons couple to the Higgs bo son and SM gauge bosons with coupling strength c H g V and to the SM fermions with coupling strength (g2/gV )cF , where g is the SM SU(2)L coupling constant. The parameter g V characterizes the interactions of the new vector bosons, while the dimension less coefficients c H and c F parameterize departures of this typical strength for interactions with the Higgs and SM gauge bosons and with fermions, respectively, and are expected to be of order unity in most models. Two benchmark models are used: in the first, re ferred to as Model A, the branching ratios of the new heavy vector boson to known fermions and gauge bosons are comparable, as in some extensions of the SM gauge group [10]. In Model B, fermionic couplings to the new heavy vector boson are suppressed, as for example in a composite Higgs model [11]. The regions of HVT pa rameter space studied correspond to the production of resonances with an intrinsic width that is narrow relative to the experimen tal resolution. The latter is roughly 8% of the resonance mass. The sensitivity of the analysis to wider resonances is not tested. In ad dition, while the production rates of the new heavy charged and neutral states are related within the HVT model, the search pre sented here assumes the production of only a charged or neutral resonance and not both simultaneously.",

The ATLAS searches (using leptonic V decays) based on data collected at s = 8TeVset a lower limit at the 95% confidence level (CL) on the W ^ ( Z ^) mass at 1.47 (1.36) TeV in HVT benchmark Model A with gV = 1 [12]. Using the same decay modes, a search based on 3.2 fb-1 of data collected at \u221as = 13 TeV set a 95% CL lower limit on the W ^ ( Z ^) mass at 1.75 (1.49) TeV [13] in the HVT benchmark Model A. For Model B the corresponding limits are 2.22 (1.58) TeV. Searches by the CMS Collaboration at s = 8TeVin hadronic channels, based on HVT benchmark Model B with g V = 3, exclude heavy resonance masses below 1.6 TeV (W^ \u2192 WH), below 1.1 TeV and between 1.3 TeV and 1.5 TeV ( Z ^ \u2192 ZH), and below 1.7 TeV (combined V ^ \u2192 VH) [14] at the 95% CL. Using the W^ \u2192 WH \u2192 ^\u03bdbb\u00af channel, CMS excludes new heavy vector bosons with masses up to 1.5 TeV in the same context [15]. The CMS Collaboration also carried out a search for a narrow resonance decaying to ZH in the qq\u00af\u03c4 +\u03c4 -final state, setting limits on the Z^ production cross section [16]. Searches for heavy resonances in HVT models have also been carried out in the hadronic WW/W Z/ZZ channels by the ATLAS experiment at \u221as = 13 TeV with 3.2 fb-1 of data [17].",

The signal is modelled using bench mark Model A with g V = 1. Results derived from this model can be directly applied to benchmark Model B by rescaling the relevant branching ratios. The signal was generated with Mad-graph5_aMC@NLO 2.2.2 [24] interfaced to Pythia 8.186 [25] for parton shower and hadronization, with the NNPDF2.3 next-toleading order (NLO) parton distribution function (PDF) set [26] and a set of tuned parameters called the ATLAS A14 tune [27] for the underlying event. The Higgs boson mass was set to 125.5 GeV, and Higgs boson decays to both bb\u00af and cc\u00af , assuming SM branch ing ratios, were included in the simulation.

A 2% absolute uncertainty is assigned to the large-R jet pT , and to the mass and D 2 resolutions relative 20% and 15% uncertainties are assigned, respectively. The uncertainty in the b-tagging efficiency for track jets is based on the uncertainty in the measured tagging efficiency for b-jets in data following the methodology used in Ref. [47]. This is measured as a function of b -jet pT and ranges between 2% and 8% for track jets with p T < 250 GeV. For track jets with p T > 250 GeV the uncertainty in the tagging efficiencies is extrapolated using MC simulation [47] and is approximately 9% for track jets with p T > 400 GeV. A 30% normalization uncertainty is applied to the tt\u00af background based on the ATLAS tt\u00af differential cross-section measurement [56]. Due to the small contribution of the V +jets background, no corresponding uncertainty is considered.",

A test statistic based on the profile likelihood ratio [58] is used to test hypothesized values of \u03bc, the global signal strength factor, separately for each model considered. The statistical analysis described below is performed using the m JJ distribution of the data observed in the signal re gions. The systematic uncertainties are modelled with Gaussian or log-normal constraint terms (nuisance parameters) in the defini tion of the likelihood function. The data distributions from the 1-tag and 2-tag signal regions are used in the fit simultaneously, treating systematic uncertainties on the luminosity, jet energy scale, jet energy resolution, jet mass resolution and b-tagging as fully correlated between the two signal regions. Both the multijet normalization and shape uncertainties are treated as independent between the two signal regions. In addition, the multijet shape uncertainties for m JJ above and below 2TeV are treated as in dependent. When performing the fit, the nuisance parameters are allowed to vary within their constraints to maximize the likeli hood. As a result of the fit, the multijet shape uncertainties are significantly reduced. With the jet mass resolution, jet energy scale and multijet normalization, they have the largest impact on the search sensitivity. Fits in the WH and ZH signal regions are per formed separately. The preand post-fit m JJ distributions in the signal regions are shown in Fig. 3.",
