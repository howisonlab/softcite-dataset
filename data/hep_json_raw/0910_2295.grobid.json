To proceed with a measurement of \u2206\u0393 s one assumption is generally made: that the B 0 s light mass eigenstate is CP even and the heavy state is CP odd. With this assumption, two approaches to measuring \u2206\u0393 s are pursued. The first is to analyse B 0 s \u2192 J\u03c8\u03c6 decays, fitting the angular distributions between the decay products in order to decipher the CP odd and even content. The second is to measure the lifetime in a CP specific decay for which the proportion of CP odd and even states is known a priori. ",

This causes the likelihood function to have two minima. Confidence regions in the \u03b2 J/\u03c8\u03c6 s \u2212 \u2206\u0393 plane are constructed by CDF, Figure 2 (left). The resulting regions show the expected double minimum structure and are shifted with respect to the SM expectation. The significances of the deviation is 1.8 standard deviations. Combina-  tion of the CDF and D0 results has been performed [5]. The combination includes the D0 analysis with 2.8 fb \u22121 [6] and a previous CDF result [7] that used only 1.35 fb \u22121 of data. Confidence regions, shown in Figure 2 (right), result in a 2.2\u03c3 deviation of \u03b2 J/\u03c8\u03c6 s from the SM. Although the combined deviation from the SM expectation is not statistically significant, the independent CDF and D0 fluctuations in the same direction are interesting to follow in the future as the analyzes will be updated using more data. By the end of the Tevatron running, samples of 8 fb \u22121 are expected. A joint effort of the CDF and D0 is currently underway to produce Tevatron combined confidence regions in the \u2206\u0393 s \u2212 \u03b2 s plan. Two approaches are pursued: the first combines the bi-dimensional profile likelihoods of the two experiments, a preliminary result can be found in [8]; the second approach, more powerful but on a longer time scale, will perform a simultaneous fit of the CDF and D0 data.",

Good sensitivity to \u2206m s can be exploited to calibrate improved flavor tagging algorithms. At CDF, a new flavor tagging algorithm is under development. The new approach combines the information of alla the tracks in the event. For a given B s candidate, tracks are divided in three categories: 1) tracks in the same side in wich the B s was found; 2) tracks that are an electron or muon candidate; 3) all remaining tracks. For each category, a track flavor correlation neural network is trained; finally, the output of the track flavor correlation neural networks are combined in a likelihood ratio. The new flavor tagger is currently calibrated and checked on Monte Carlo samples and on a new B 0 s mixing measurement. The new flavor tagger will be used in the flavor tagged CP Violation Phase \u03b2 J/\u03c8\u03c6 s analysis.",
