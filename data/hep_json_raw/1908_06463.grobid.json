The data sample, collected during the 2016-2018 data taking of the LHC, corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 137 fb \u22121 at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The events are required to contain two same-sign charged leptons (electrons or muons) or at least three leptons, and jets. The observed and expected significances for the tt tt signal are respectively 2.6 and 2.7 standard deviations, and the tt tt cross section is measured to be 12.6 +5.8   \u22125.2 fb. The results are used to constrain the Yukawa coupling of the top quark to the Higgs boson, y t , yielding a limit of |y t /y SM t | < 1.7 at 95% confidence level, where y SM t is the SM value of y t . They are also used to constrain the oblique parameter of the Higgs boson in an effective field theory framework,\u0124 < 0.12. Limits are set on the production of a heavy scalar or pseudoscalar boson in Type-II two-Higgs-doublet and simplified dark matter models, with exclusion limits reaching 350-470 GeV and 350-550 GeV for scalar and pseudoscalar bosons, respectively. Upper bounds are also set on couplings of the top quark to new light particles.",

Moreover, tt tt produce-mail: cms-publication-committee-chair@cern.ch tion can be significantly enhanced by beyond-the-SM (BSM) particles and interactions. New particles coupled to the top quark, such as heavy scalar and pseudoscalar bosons predicted in Type-II two-Higgs-doublet models (2HDM) [4][5][6] and by simplified models of dark matter (DM) [7,8], can contribute to \u03c3 (pp \u2192 tt tt) when their masses are larger than twice the mass of the top quark, with diagrams similar to Fig. 1 (right). Additionally, less massive particles can enhance \u03c3 (pp \u2192 tt tt) via off-shell contributions [9]. In the model-independent framework of SM effective field theory, four-fermion couplings [10], as well as a modifier to the Higgs boson propagator [11], can be constrained through a measurement of \u03c3 (pp \u2192 tt tt). Conversely, models with new particles with masses on the order of 1 TeV, such as gluino pair production in the framework of supersymmetry [12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20][21], are more effectively probed through studies of tt tt production in boosted events or by requiring very large imbalances in momentum.",

Simulated samples generated at NLO are also used to estimate backgrounds from associated production of single top quarks and vector bosons (tWZ, tZq, t\u03b3), or tt produced in association with a single boson (tt W, tt Z, tt H, tt\u03b3). Three separate sets of simulated events for each process are used in order to match the different data-taking conditions and algorithms used in 2016, 2017, and 2018. Most samples are generated using the Mad-Graph5_amc@nlo 2.2.2 (2.4.2) program [28] at NLO for 2016 samples (2017 and 2018 samples) with at most two additional partons in the matrix element calculations. In particular, the tt W sample is generated with up to one additional parton, and tt Z and tt H with no additional partons. The tt Z sample, which includes tt Z/\u03b3 * \u2192 , is generated with a dilepton invariant mass greater than 1 GeV. For the WZ sample used with 2016 conditions, as well as all ZZ and tt H samples, the powheg box v2 [29,30] program is used. The MadGraph5_amc@nlo generator at LO with up to three additional partons, scaled to NLO cross sections, is used to produce a subset of samples for some of the data taking periods: W\u03b3 (2016), tt\u03b3 (2017 and 2018), tZq (2018), and t\u03b3 (2018) [28]. Other rare backgrounds, such as tt production in association with dibosons (tt WW, tt WZ, tt ZZ, tt WH, tt ZW, tt HH) and triple top quark production (tt t, tt tW), are generated using LO MadGraph5_amc@nlo without additional partons, and scaled to NLO cross sections [31]. The background from radiative top decays, with \u03b3 * \u2192 , was found to be negligible in this analysis.",

In the context of type-II 2HDM, these samples are scaled to LO cross sections obtained with MadGraph5_amc@nlo model, \"2HDMtII\" [32,33]. For the choice tan \u03b2 = 1 in the alignment limit [34], where tan \u03b2 represents the ratio of vacuum expectation values of the two Higgs doublets, these cross sections reproduce those of Ref. [6], which were also used in the previous CMS result [27]. In the context of simplified models of dark matter, these samples are scaled to LO cross sections obtained with the model used in Ref. [35], which includes kinematically accessible decays of the mediator into a pair of top quarks. The processes are simulated in the narrowwidth approximation, suitable for the parameter space studied here, in which the width of the mediator is 5% of its mass or less. Samples and cross sections used for constraining the modified Higgs boson propagator are generated using MadGraph5_amc@nlo at LO, matching the prescription of Ref. [11]. Cross sections used for SM tt tt enhanced by scalar and vector off-shell diagrams are obtained at LO from Ref. [9].",

The underlying event modeling uses the CUETP8M1 tune [42,43] for 2016, and CP5 [44] for 2017 and 2018 data sets, respectively. The top quark mass in the Monte Carlo programs is set to 172.5 GeV.

The jet momentum is determined as the vectorial sum of all PF candidate momenta in the jet. An offset correction is applied to jet energies to take into account the contribution from pileup [53]. Jet energy corrections are derived from simulation and are improved with in situ measurements of the energy balance in dijet, multijet, \u03b3 +jet, and leptonically decaying Z+jet events [54,55]. Additional selection criteria are applied to each jet to remove jets potentially affected by instrumental effects or reconstruction failures [56]. Jets originating from b quarks are identified as b-tagged jets using a deep neural network algorithm, DeepCSV [57], with a working point chosen such that the efficiency to identify a b jet is 55-70% for a jet p T between 20 and 400 GeV. The misidentification rate is approximately 1-2% for light-flavor and gluon jets and 10-15% for charm jets, in the same jet p T range. The vector p miss T is defined as the projection on the plane perpendicular to the beams of the negative vector sum of the momenta of all reconstructed PF candidates in an event [58]. Its magnitude, called missing transverse momentum, is referred to as p miss T .",

The reweighting is based on a comparison of the light-flavor jet multiplicity in dilepton tt events in data and simulation, where the simulation is performed with the same generator settings as those of the tt W and tt Z samples. The method requires exactly two jets identified as originating from b quarks in the event and assumes that all other jets are from ISR or FSR. The N ISR/FSR jets reweighting factors vary within the range of [0.77, 1.46] for N ISR/FSR jets between 1 and 4. This correction is not applied to tt H (H \u2192 WW) events, which already have additional jets from the decay of the additional W bosons. In addition to the ISR or FSR correction, the tt W, tt Z, and tt H simulation is corrected to improve the modeling of the flavor of additional jets, based on the measured ratio of the tt bb and tt jj cross sections, 1.7\u00b10.6 , reported in Ref.

The tight identification (for electrons) and isolation (for both electrons and muons) requirements of the SRs are relaxed to define a loose lepton selection, enriched in nonprompt leptons. The efficiency, TL , for nonprompt leptons that satisfy the loose selection to also satisfy the tight selection is measured in a control sample of single-lepton events, as a function of lepton flavor, p T , and |\u03b7|, after subtracting the prompt-lepton contamination based on simulation. The loose selection is chosen to ensure that TL remains stable across the main categories of nonprompt leptons specified in Sect. 4, allowing the same TL to be applied to samples with different nonprompt lepton composition. For leptons failing the tight selection, the p T variable is redefined as the sum of the lepton p T and the energy in the isolation cone exceeding the isolation threshold value. This parametrization accounts for the momentum spectrum of the parent parton (the parton that produced the nonprompt lepton), allowing the same TL to be applied to samples with different parent parton momenta with reduced bias. To estimate the number of nonprompt leptons in each SR, a dedicated set of application regions is defined, requiring at least one lepton to fail the tight selection while satisfying the loose one (loose-not-tight). Events in these regions are then weighted by a factor of TL /(1 \u2212 TL ) for each loosenot-tight lepton.

In all cases, simulated events are reweighted to match the efficiencies measured in data. The uncertainty associated with jet energy corrections results in yield variations of 1-15% across SRs. Uncertainties in the jet energy resolution result in 1-10% variations [54].",

For the charge-misidentified lepton background, the uncertainty is based on the agree-ment observed between the prediction and data as a function of kinematic distributions, in a data sample enriched in Z \u2192 e + e \u2212 events with one electron or positron having a misidentified charge. For the nonprompt-lepton background, the uncertainty is based on the agreement observed in simulation closure tests of the \"tight-to-loose\" method using multijet, tt, and W+ jets samples. The contamination of prompt leptons, which is subtracted based on simulation, is below 1% in the application region, but it can be significant in the control sample where TL is measured, resulting in an uncertainty up to 50% in TL . The statistical uncertainty in the estimate based on control samples in data is taken into account for both backgrounds. It is negligible for the charge-misidentified lepton background, while for the nonprompt-lepton background it can be comparable or larger than the systematic uncertainty. Experimental uncertainties in normalization and shape are treated as fully correlated among the SRs for all signal and background processes. Two choices of correlation across years (uncorrelated or fully correlated) were tested for each experimental uncertainty, and their impact on the measurement of \u03c3 (tttt) was found to be smaller than 1%. For simplicity, these uncertainties are then treated as uncorrelated. Systematic uncertainties in the background estimates based on control samples in data and theoretical uncertainties in the normalization of each background process are treated as uncorrelated between processes but fully correlated among the SRs and across the 3 years. Scale and PDF uncertainties, as well as uncertainties in the number of additional b quarks, are correlated between processes, signal regions, and years. Statistical uncertainties due to the finite number of simulated events or control region events are considered uncorrelated.",

            "text": "This analysis is used to constrain SM parameters, as well as production of BSM particles and operators that can affect the tt tt production rate. The existence of tt tt Feynman diagrams with virtual Higgs bosons allows interpreting the upper limit on \u03c3 (pp \u2192 tt tt) as a constraint on the Yukawa coupling, y t , between the top quark and the Higgs boson [2,3]. Similarly, the measurement can be interpreted as a constraint on the Higgs boson oblique parameter\u0124 , defined as the Wilson coefficient of the dimension-six BSM operator modifying the Higgs boson propagator [11]. More generically, Feynman diagrams where the virtual Higgs boson is replaced by a virtual BSM scalar (\u03c6) or vector (Z ) particle with mass smaller than twice the top quark mass (m < 2m t ), are used to interpret the result as a constraint on the couplings of such new particles [9]. In addition, new particles with m > 2m t , such as a heavy scalar (H) or pseudoscalar (A), can be produced on-shell in association with top quarks. They can subsequently decay into top quark pairs, generating final states with three or four top quarks. Constraints on the production of such heavy particles can be interpreted in terms of 2HDM parameters [4][5][6], or in the framework of simplified models of dark matter [7,8]. When using our tt tt to determine a constraint on y t , we verified using a LO simulation that the signal acceptance is not affected by the relative contribution of the virtual Higgs boson Feynman diagrams. We take into account the dependence of the backgrounds on y t by scaling the tt H cross section by |y t /y SM t | 2 prior to the fit, where y SM t represents the SM value of the top quark Yukawa coupling. As a result of the tt H background rescaling, the measured \u03c3 (pp \u2192 tt tt) depends on |y t /y SM t |, as shown in Fig. 5. The measurement is compared to the theoretical prediction obtained from the LO calculation of Ref. [2], scaled to the 12.0 +2.2 \u22122.5 fb cross section obtained in Ref. [1], and including the uncertainty associated with doubling and halving the renormalization and factorization scales. Comparing the observed limit on \u03c3 (pp \u2192 tt tt) with the central, upper, and lower values of its theoretical prediction, we obtain 95% CL limits of |y t /y SM t | < 1.7, 1.4, and 2.0, respectively, an improvement over the previous CMS result [27]. Alternatively, assuming that the on-shell Yukawa The predicted value (dashed line) [2], calculated at LO and scaled to the calculation from Ref. [1], is also plotted. The shaded band around the measured value gives the total uncertainty, while the shaded band around the predicted curve shows the theoretical uncertainty associated with the renormalization and factorization scales coupling is equal to that of the SM, we do not rescale the tt H background with respect to its SM prediction, and obtain corresponding limits on the off-shell Yukawa coupling of |y t /y SM t | < 1.8, 1.5, and 2.1. Since y t affects the Higgs boson production cross section in both the gluon fusion and tt H modes, constraints on y t can also be obtained from a combination of Higgs boson measurements [74]. However, these constraints require assumptions about the total width of the Higgs boson, while the tt tt-based limit does not. For th\u00ea H interpretation, the BDT analysis is repeated using simu- Fig. 7 The observed (points) and expected (dashed line) 95% CL upper limits on the cross section times branching fraction to tt for the production of a new heavy scalar H (left) and pseudoscalar A (right), as a function of mass. The inner and outer bands around the expected limits indicate the regions containing 68 and 95%, respectively, of the distribution of limits under the background-only hypothesis. Theoretical values are shown for Type-II 2HDM in the alignment limit (solid line) and simplified dark matter (dot-dashed line) models Fig. 8 The observed (solid curve) and expected (long-dashed curve) 95% CL exclusion regions in the tan \u03b2 versus mass plane for Type-II 2HDM models in the alignment limit for a new scalar H (upper left), pseudoscalar A (upper right), and both (lower) particles.

The excluded regions are below the curves lated samples of tt tt signal events with different values of\u0124 to account for small acceptance and kinematic differences, as described in Sect. 2. We rescale the tt H cross section by (1 \u2212\u0124 ) 2 to account for its\u0124 dependency [11]. This results in the 95% CL upper limit of\u0124 < 0.12. For reference, the authors of Ref. [11] used recent LHC on-shell Higgs boson measurements to set a constraint of\u0124 < 0.16 at 95% CL.",

Such particles are at present only weakly constrained, while they can give significant contributions to the tt tt cross section [9]. Having verified in LO simulation that these new particles affect the signal acceptance by less than 10%, we recalculate the \u03c3 (pp \u2192 tt tt) upper limit of the BDT analysis including an The excluded regions, shaded, are above the limit curves. The dashed lines show the limits assuming a weaker coupling between H/A and \u03c7, g DM = 0.5 additional 10% uncertainty in the acceptance, and obtain the 95% CL upper limit of 23.0 fb on the total tt tt cross section, slightly weaker than the 22.5 fb limit obtained in Sect. 7. Comparing this upper limit to the predicted cross section in models where tt tt production includes a \u03c6 or a Z in addition to SM contributions and associated interference, we set limits on the masses and couplings of these new particles, shown in Fig. 6. These limits exclude couplings larger than 1.2 for m \u03c6 in the 25-340 GeV range and larger than 0.1 (0.9) for m Z = 25 (300) GeV.",

At such masses, the production rate of these particles in association with a single top quark (tqH/A, tWH/A) becomes significant, so we include these processes in addition to ttH/A. As pointed out in Ref. [6], these processes do not suffer significant interference with the SM tt tt process. To obtain upper limits on the sum of these processes followed by the decay H/A \u2192 tt, we use the BDT analysis and treat the SM tt tt process as a background. Figure 7 shows the excluded cross section as a function of the mass of the scalar (left) and pseudoscalar (right). Comparing these limits with the Type-II 2HDM cross sections with tan \u03b2 = 1 in the alignment limit, we exclude scalar (pseudoscalar) masses up to 470 (550) GeV, improving by more than 100 GeV with respect to the previous CMS limits [26]. Alternatively, we consider the simplified model of dark matter defined in Ref. [35], which includes a Dirac fermion dark matter candidate, \u03c7 , in addition to H/A, and where the cou-plings of H/A to SM fermions and \u03c7 are determined by parameters g SM and g DM , respectively. In this model, exclusions similar to those from 2HDM are reached by assuming g SM = 1 and g DM = 1, and taking m H/A < 2m \u03c7 . Relaxing the 2HDM assumption of tan \u03b2 = 1, Fig. 8 shows the 2HDM limit as a function of H/A mass and tan \u03b2, considering one new particle at a time and also including a scenario with m H = m A inspired by a special case of Type-II 2HDM, the hMSSM [75]. Values of tan \u03b2 up to 0.8-1.6 are excluded, depending on the assumptions made. These exclusions are comparable to those of a recent CMS search for the resonant production of H/A in the p \u2192 H/A \u2192 tt channel [76]. Relaxing the m H/A < 2m \u03c7 assumption in the dark matter model, Fig. 9 shows the limit in this model as a function of the masses of both H/A and \u03c7 , for g DM = 1 and for two different assumptions of g SM . Large sections of the phase space of simplified dark matter models are excluded, and the reach of this analysis is complementary to that of analyses considering decays of H/A into invisible dark matter candidates, such as those of Refs. [35,77].",

The final state with either two same-sign leptons or at least three leptons is analyzed using two strategies, the first relying on a cut-based categorization in lepton and jet multiplicity and jet flavor, the second taking advantage of a multivariate approach to distinguish the tt tt signal from its many backgrounds. The more precise multivariate strategy yields an observed (expected) significance of 2.6 (2.7) standard deviations relative to the background-only hypothesis, and a measured value for the tt tt cross section of 12.6 +5.8 \u22125.2 fb. The results based on the two strategies are in agreement with each other and with the SM prediction of 12.0 +2.2 \u22122.5 fb [1]. The results of the boosted decision tree (BDT) analysis are also used to constrain the top quark Yukawa coupling y t relative to its SM value, based on the |y t | dependence of \u03c3 (pp \u2192 tt tt) calculated at leading order in Ref. [2], resulting in the 95% confidence level (CL) limit of |y t /y SM t | < 1.7. The Higgs boson oblique parameter in the effective field theory framework [11] is similarly constrained to\u0124 < 0.12 at 95% CL. Upper limits ranging from 0.1 to 1.2 are also set on the coupling between the top quark and a new scalar (\u03c6) or vector (Z ) particle with mass less than twice that of the top quark (m t ) [9]. For new scalar (H) or pseudoscalar (A) particles with m > 2m t , and decaying to tt, their production in association with a single top quark or a top quark pair is probed. The resulting cross section upper limit, between 15 and 35 fb at 95% CL, is interpreted in the context of Type-II two-Higgs-doublet models [4][5][6]75] as a function of tan \u03b2 and m H/A , and in the context of simplified dark matter models [7,8], as a function of m H/A and the mass of the dark matter candidate. accelerator departments for the excellent performance of the LHC and thank the technical and administrative staffs at CERN and at other CMS institutes for their contributions to the success of the CMS effort.
