The ratio R \u03c8\u03b3 is predicted to be in the range (3-4) \u00d7 10 \u22123 for a DD * molecule [22][23][24], 1.2-15 for a pure charmonium state [25][26][27][28][29][30][31][32] and 0.5-5 for a molecule-charmonium mixture [29,33].

The detector includes a high-precision tracking system consisting of a silicon-strip vertex detector surrounding the pp interaction region, a large-area silicon-strip detector located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4 Tm, and three stations of silicon-strip detectors and straw drift tubes placed downstream. The combined tracking system provides a momentum measurement with relative uncertainty that varies from 0.4% at 5 GeV/c to 0.6% at 100 GeV/c, and impact parameter resolution of 20 \u00b5m for tracks with high transverse momentum. Charged hadrons are identified using two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors [35]. The calorimeter system consists of a scintillating pad detector (SPD) and a pre-shower system (PS), followed by electromagnetic (ECAL) and hadron calorimeters. The SPD and PS are designed to distinguish between signals from photons and electrons. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers [36].",
