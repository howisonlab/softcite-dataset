Also particularly sensitive to the PDFs is the charge asymmetry of leptonic W decays. The variation of this asymmetry with the lepton pseudo rapidity (see Fig. 12) reflects combined effects of PDFs, W polarization and V-A decay of the W. The sign inversion around =3.0, which falls into the acceptance of the LHCb experiment is nicely reproduced by simulations. Larger data sets, as now available, will certainly improve the knowledge of PDFs.  Z production is the best possible place to assess the efficiency and the accuracy of decays reconstruction. The trigger efficiency is the first problem to be overcome, given the large fraction of transverse momentum taken by the neutrinos in the final state. To reach low enough thresholds, double conditions are required, like illustrated for example in Fig. 6 for the -had final state. The hadronic \" -jets\" are separated from electron showers and from jets by a combination of criteria on charged tracks (1 or 3), on shower shapes in the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters, and on isolation. Finally to isolate Z decays, a minimum E \u00d1 \u00d7\u00d7 \u00cc is required. Fig. 13 shows the spectrum obtained by CMS [11] in the muon-hadron channel, still with 2010 data.

This difference has an rms of 30mm, thus corresponding to a primary vertex accuracy of 15mm, well below the longitudinal spread of primary vertices (about 56 mm), and accurate enough to give a contribution to the m resolution negligible compared to the effect of the photon energies resolution. When one or both of the photons are converted in the inner detector volume, the coordinate of this conversion point is used, with the shower barycentre, to give an even more accurate photon direction. The energy response of the calorimeter is calibrated using Z \u00bc decays in \u2022 pairs. Monte-Carlo simulations are used to take into account the small differences in response between electrons, converted photons, and unconverted photons. With the available statistics, the calibration was made by bins of AE =0.1, without any subdivision in azimuth. By comparing the width of the Z \u00bc line shape to Monte-Carlo simulations, this procedure also allows to estimate the \"constant term\" of the energy resolution, which, for the data set considered for this optimization (2010 data worth 36 pb \u00bd ) was 1.1 \u00a60.5% in the barrel ( 1.37) and 1.8 \u00a6 0.6% in the end-caps (1.52 2.37).

Non resonant ZZ production as considered in section 2.5 is an irreducible background, while and \u00d8 \u00d8 are the main other backgrounds, reduced by isolation and impact parameter requirements. The key point when addressing the low Higgs boson mass range is the reconstruction and identification efficiencies of leptons, and in particular electrons of transverse momenta down to 5 to 7 GeV. In an extended sample as compared to section 3.5 (up to 2.28 fb \u00bd ), 27 events were selected (6ee, 9e and 12 ) with one Z mass requirement (76 to 106 GeV) while 28\u00a64 were expected. One event only had a mass below 140 GeV, as shown in Fig. 22. The main performance effort for this channel, both in ATLAS and CMS, is towards improving the efficiency of soft leptons. On the analysis point of view the very low mass range (below 140 GeV) may benefit from considering events where the two Z are off mass shell, an attempt already made by CMS (see talks at this Conference). This decay mode is a very useful complement to in the low mass range, and a key channel for the MSSM Higgs for a large range of M and tan\u00ac values. Recently, CMS made public [22] an analysis with 1.6 fb \u00bd of data, using the e-, e-had and -had final states, triggered by either a lepton or a lepton plus a -jet (see section 3.3). The -jets are reconstructed using particle flow and identified as briefly described in 3.3. One of the main backgrounds is W+jets, where the W decay leptonically, and the jet is misidentified as a -jet. This background is rejected by cutting on the E \u00d1 \u00d7\u00d7 \u00cc projected onto the bisector of the two \"visible\" decay products. The analysis is made using the invariant mass of the two visible decay products.",
