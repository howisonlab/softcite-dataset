This signature is sensitive to the Higgs sector of the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) with large values of the parameter tan \u03b2. The analysis is based on data from proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV collected with the CMS detector at the LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb \u22121 . The results are combined with a previous analysis based on 7 TeV data. No signal is observed. Stringent upper limits on the cross section times branching fraction are derived for Higgs bosons with masses up to 900 GeV, and the results are interpreted within different MSSM benchmark scenarios, m max h , m mod+ h , m mod\u2212 h , light-stau and light-stop. Observed 95% confidence level upper limits on tan \u03b2, ranging from 14 to 50, are obtained in the m mod+ h benchmark scenario.",

While the measured properties of the observed boson are in agreement with the expectations of the standard model (SM) with the current experimental precision, this particle could well be the first visible member of an extended Higgs sector, which would be a direct indication of new physics. Extended Higgs sectors are possible in various theoretical models, such as Supersymmetry [4][5][6][7], which relates fermionic and bosonic degrees of freedom and in consequence requires the introduction of additional Higgs -1 -",

Among the latter are two CP-even (h, H) and one CP-odd state (A). The recently discovered boson with a mass near 125 GeV might then be interpreted as one of the neutral CP-even states. Two parameters, generally chosen as the mass of the pseudoscalar Higgs boson m A and the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two Higgs doublets, tan \u03b2 = v 2 /v 1 , define the properties of the Higgs sector in the MSSM at tree level. For tan \u03b2 values larger than one, the couplings of the Higgs field to downtype fermions are enhanced relative to those to the up-type fermions. Furthermore, the A boson is nearly degenerate in mass with either the h or H boson. These effects enhance the combined cross section for producing these Higgs bosons in association with b quarks by a factor of \u22482 tan 2 \u03b2. The decay \u03c6 \u2192 bb is expected to have a high branching fraction (\u224890%), even at large values of the Higgs boson mass [11].",

Preceding limits had been obtained by the LEP [16] and Tevatron experiments [17][18][19]. Also the \u03c6 \u2192 \u00b5\u00b5 decay mode has been investigated [13,20]. Besides extending the MSSM Higgs boson search to an independent channel, the \u03c6 \u2192 bb decay mode is particularly sensitive to the higgsino mass parameter \u00b5 [21], and thus to the bottom quark Yukawa coupling. In the \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 channel, the sensitivity to \u00b5 is much smaller due to a partial cancellation of the respective radiative corrections between the contributions to the production and decay processes [21]. Beyond the MSSM interpretation, lepton-specific two-Higgs-doublet models (2HDM) [22] may allow for enhanced couplings of down-type quarks relative to leptons. The bb decay mode is also relevant in the more general context of exotic resonance searches, motivated for example by dark-matter models involving mediator particles with a large coupling to b quarks [23,24].",

The analysis searches for a peak in the invariant mass distribution of the two b jets with the highest p T values, which are assumed to originate from the Higgs boson decay. The dominant background is the production of heavy-flavor multijet events containing either three b jets, or two b jets plus a third jet originating from either a charm quark, a light-flavor quark or a gluon, which is misidentified as a b quark jet.

Within the field volume, the inner tracker is formed by a silicon pixel and strip tracker. It measures charged particles within the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 2.5. The tracker provides a transverse impact parameter resolution of approximately 15 \u00b5m and a resolution on p T of about 1.5% for 100 GeV particles. Also inside the field volume are a crystal electromagnetic calorimeter, and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter. Muons are measured in gas-ionization detectors embedded in the steel flux-return yoke, in the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 2.4, with detector planes made using three technologies: drift tubes, cathode strip chambers, and resistive-plate chambers. Matching muons to tracks measured in the silicon tracker results in a p T resolution between 1% and 5%, for p T values up to 1 TeV. Forward calorimetry extends the coverage provided by the barrel and endcap detectors up to |\u03b7| < 5. A detailed description of the CMS detector, together with a definition of the coordinate system used and the relevant kinematic variables, can be found in ref. [27].",

The leading jet (here and in the following the jets are ordered by decreasing p T ) is required to have p T > 80 GeV, while the subleading jet must have p T > 70 GeV. Furthermore, the event is only accepted if the absolute value of the difference in pseudorapidity between any two jets fulfilling the p T and \u03b7 requirements is less than or equal to 1.74. The tight online requirements on the angular variables of the jets are introduced to reduce the trigger rates while preserving the signal significances in the probed mass range of JHEP11 (2015)071the Higgs bosons. At the trigger level, b jets are identified using an algorithm that requires at least two tracks with high 3D impact parameter significance to be associated with the jet. At least two jets within the event must meet the online b tagging criteria to be accepted by the trigger. The efficiency of the jet-p T requirements in the trigger are derived from the data with zero-bias triggered events. The online b tagging efficiencies relative to the offline b tagging selection are obtained from simulations of QCD events generated with pythia and scaled to account for the different b tagging efficiencies between data and simulation.

            "text": "From these three double-b-tag categories, background templates are constructed by weighting each untagged jet with the b tagging probability according to its assumed flavor. In the template nomenclature, the convention is to indicate the assumed flavor with a -6 -JHEP11(2015)071 capital letter, and it can be one of the five options Q, C1, B1, C2, and B2, where Q refers to light quarks or gluons, while C1 and C2 refer to a jet with a single charm quark and a pair of charm quarks, respectively. Similarly, B1 and B2 refer to jets assumed to contain a single bottom quark and a pair of bottom quarks, respectively. The total number of templates is therefore 15. Each background template is a binned distribution in the twodimensional space spanned by M 12 , the dijet mass of the two leading jets, and the event b tagging variable X 123 . For the construction of each template, each event is weighted with the b tagging probability corresponding to the assumed flavor of the untagged jet. This weight accounts for the effect of the b tagging discriminant threshold. The b tagging probability for each flavor is determined with simulated QCD multijet events, where the flavor selection is based on Monte Carlo truth information. Data/MC scale factors for the b tagging efficiencies are applied where appropriate [34]. Since the b tagging efficiency has a characteristic dependence on p T and \u03b7 for each flavor, the weighting results in different shapes of the M 12 distributions. The X 123 dimension of the templates is modeled in the following way: in a given M 12 bin, an event can contribute to different X 123 bins depending on the flavor of its jets and its kinematics. For the two b-tagged jets, the secondary vertex mass sum information is taken as measured. For the untagged jet, each of the four possible values of the secondary vertex mass sum index is taken into account with a weight according to the probability that a jet with given flavor, p T and \u03b7 will assume this value. These probabilities, parametrized as a function of the jet p T and \u03b7, were determined from simulated events, and validated in control data samples.",

A second correction is required since the online b tagging patterns are different in the double-and the triple-b-tag samples. In double-b-tag events, the two online b tags usually coincide with the offline b tags, while in triple-b-tag events the online b tags can be assigned to any two-jet subset of the three leading jets.

In the cases where one of the two leading jets is untagged, and the flavor assumption is the same, e.g. Qbb, and bQb, the templates are combined, resulting in a merged template ( Beyond QCD multijet production, top-quark pair (tt) events pose the largest potential background to the signal topology. The requirement of three b-tagged jets reduces this background substantially, since only two highly energetic b-tagged jets are expected from the decays of the top quarks. However, one of the W bosons can decay into a cs pair, and the c jet can be mistagged as b jet. Using the tt Monte Carlo sample, the tt contribution is found to be relatively small; the number of tt events passing the selections of the doubleand triple-b-tag datasets it estimated to be about a factor of 70 smaller than the total amount of data in these samples. The invariant mass spectrum from tt is very similar to the one from the QCD multijet background, and does not show any narrow peaks.

The incompatible regions in the parameter space are illustrated by the hatched areas in both plots in figure 7. In the m max h scenario, the MSSM parameters beyond tree level have been tuned such that m h becomes as large as possible. As a result, large m A and already moderate values of tan \u03b2 lead to m h values that are higher than the measured Higgs boson mass. This apparent exclusion of large tan \u03b2 values is, however, an artificial consequence of the assumptions in the m max h scenario. Recently, several new MSSM benchmark scenarios have been proposed, which are more naturally compatible with the observed Higgs boson at 125 GeV [21], and among them the m mod+ h , m modh , light-stop, and light-stau scenarios are also used in the following for the interpretation of the results of this analysis. The observed and expected 95% CL exclusion limits in these scenarios with \u00b5 = +200 GeV, obtained with the combined 7 and 8 TeV data, are shown in figure 8. (The term \"stop\" refers to the supersymmetric partner of the top quark throughout this paper. Results for the \u03c4 -phobic and low-m H scenarios are not shown because the analysis has sensitivity in a limited mass region only.) The limits obtained in all MSSM benchmark scenarios are listed in tables 6 to 11 in appendix B. , light-stop, and light-stau benchmark scenarios with \u00b5 = +200 GeV [21].",

The data were taken with dedicated triggers using all-hadronic jet signatures combined with online b tagging. A selection of events with three b-tagged jets has been performed in the offline analysis. A signal has been searched for in the two-dimensional spectrum formed by the invariant mass of the two leading jets and a condensed event b-tag estimator. No evidence for a signal is found. The observed distributions are well described by a background model constructed from events in which only two of the three leading jets are required to be b tagged. Upper limits on the Higgs boson cross section times branching fraction are obtained in the mass region from 100-900 GeV, thus extending the search to considerably higher masses than those accessed by the previous 7 TeV analysis. The upper limits range from about 250 pb at the lower end of the mass range, to about 1 pb at 900 GeV.",
