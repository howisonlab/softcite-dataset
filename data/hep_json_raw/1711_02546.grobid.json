We study the prospects of searching for these neutrinos at the upcoming Iron CALorimeter (ICAL) detector to be housed at the India-based Neutrino Observatory (INO). We perform ICAL simulations to obtain the detector efficiencies and resolutions in order to simulate muon events in ICAL due to neutrinos coming from annihilation of WIMP in the mass range m \u03c7 = (3 \u2212 100) GeV. The atmospheric neutrinos pose a major background for these indirect detection studies and can be reduced using the fact that the signal comes only from the direction of the sun. For a given WIMP mass, we find the opening angle \u03b8 90 such that 90 % of the signal events are contained within this angle and use this cone-cut criteria to reduce the atmospheric neutrino background. The reduced background is then weighted by the solar exposure function at INO to obtain the final background spectrum for a given WIMP mass. We perform a \u03c7 2 analysis and present expected exclusion regions in the \u03c3 SD \u2212 m \u03c7 and \u03c3 SI \u2212 m \u03c7 , where \u03c3 SD and \u03c3 SI are the WIMP-nucleon Spin-Dependent (SD) and Spin-Independent (SI) scattering cross-section, respectively. For a 10 years exposure and m \u03c7 = 25 GeV, the expected 90 % C.L. exclusion limit is found to be \u03c3 SD < 6.87 \u00d7 10 \u221241 cm 2 and \u03c3 SI < 7.75 \u00d7 10 \u221243 cm 2 for the \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 annihilation channel and \u03c3 SD < 1.14 \u00d7 10 \u221239 cm 2 and \u03c3 SI < 1.30 \u00d7 10 \u221241 cm 2 for the bb channel, assuming 100 % branching ratio for each of the WIMP annihilation channel.",

            "text": "Various cosmological and astrophysical observations strongly support the existence of the Dark Matter (DM) with an abundance of \u223c27%. The existence of DM was first postulated by Fritz Zwicky [1] who in an attempt to explain the dynamics of galaxies in the Coma galaxy cluster concluded that the most of the mass in the cluster must be invisible. Missing mass of spiral galaxies were also reported by Jan Oort and later confirmed by Vera Rubin (see [2] for a more recent discussion) from the observation of flat galactic rotation curves which demanded that most of the matter of the galaxy is non-luminous and existed in the form of dark haloes. This inference has been supported by the weak [3,4] and strong [5] gravitational lensing data. Observations of the bullet cluster by the Chandra satellite [6] further reinforced the idea of existence of a dark non-baryonic component of matter in the universe. Finally, the most precise measurement of the dark matter abundance of the universe comes from the measurements of the anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background spectra [7]. The most recent analysis of the data from the Planck satellite [8] gives a dark matter abundance of 0.1172 \u2264 \u2126 DM h 2 \u2264 0.1226 at 67 % C.L..",

            "text": "While the evidence for the existence of dark matter via its gravitational interactions is pretty strong, its particle nature remains largely unknown. Among the various possible candidates proposed, WIMP seem to be the most promising ones with masses ranging from a few GeVs to a few TeVs [9,10]. As the solar system moves through the DM halo, WIMP scatter off the nuclei in the celestial bodies like the sun and the earth. The scattered WIMP lose energy and could get gravitationally trapped by the gravitational potential of body and gradually sink to their cores. As WIMP annihilation rate scales with the square of its density, the core of these celestial bodies are the centres where WIMP could undergo annihilation, through various channels, into Standard Model (SM) particle-antiparticle pairs. The subsequent showering of these would give neutrinos whose energy spectra depend on the WIMP mass and annihilation channel 1 . The neutrinos thus produced deep inside the sun, will undergo oscillations, interactions and regeneration as they propagate out of the core. Detection of these neutrinos, then, in principle, would provide information about the nature of DM viz., its branching ratio, mass and cross-section. The signal neutrinos, on reaching the detector, interact with the medium and produce corresponding leptons.",

The main physics goal of this detector would be to use atmospheric neutrino events to determine the neutrino mass hierarchy [22][23][24] and atmospheric neutrino parameters [25][26][27][28] with good precision. However, it has been shown that one could use this detector to obtain competitive sensitivity to new physics scenarios such as sterile neutrinos [29], CPT violation in neutrinos [30], non-standard neutrino interactions [31], and magnetic monopoles [32] and decaying dark matter [33], among others. Since the neutrinos produced in WIMP annihilations are in the energy range of a few GeV to 100 GeV for WIMP masses in the few GeV to 100 GeV range, ICAL should be able to efficiently detect these neutrinos and constrain the WIMP paradigm of dark matter. Prospects of indirect searches for dark matter at magnetised iron calorimeters were studied before in [34][35][36]. All these studies were done assuming ad-hoc values for the detector specification such as detector efficiencies and energy and zenith angle reconstruction of the neutrino from WIMP annihilations.",

The sum in Eq. 6is over all possible channels j and the sum has to be weighted with the branching ratio (BR j ) of the particular channel j. These branching ratios can be calculated within the framework of specific models. Since we consider a generic WIMP scenario, we will take only one annihilation channel at a time and assume 100% branching ratio for that channel. The expected sensitivity limit calculated for each channel for 100 % branching ratio indicates the limit expected for that particular channel alone. A given WIMP model will predict a mixture of these channels with varying branching ratios, and hence the corresponding sensitivity limit will lie somewhere in the region bounded by the best and worst limit expected from these various channels. For instance, the expected sensitivity limit for a DM model that predicts annihilation of WIMPs into \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 with 20 % BR and into bb with 80 % BR, will lie in a region between the expected sensitivity for these two channels with 100% BR, and closer to the latter channel. It should be noted, however, that this example model explicitly assumes only two annihilation channels. In case WIMP annihilate to less competitive annihilation channels such as dd, u\u016b, ss etc the sensitivity limits would decrease proportionately. Similarly, WIMP annihilation to channels like e + e \u2212 etc which do not contribute to neutrino fluxes, would weaken the sensitivity. The annihilation of WIMP can occur through various channels : cc, bb, tt, e + e \u2212 ,  like Kaluza-Klein (KK) dark matter, WIMP could directly undergo annihilation into neutrinos \u03bd e\u03bde , \u03bd \u00b5\u03bd\u00b5 , \u03bd \u03c4\u03bd\u03c4 .

The neutrino (or antineutrino) on entering the detector interacts with detector nucleon to produce a muon (or antimuon) and hadron(s). The muon (or antimuon) produces a clean track in the magnetised iron, with the muon and antimuon bending in opposite directions, giving the detector an excellent charge identification capability. The hadron(s) produces a shower, which can also be detected. The detector is expected to have good muon energy and angle resolution, reasonably good muon reconstruction efficiency and excellent charge identification efficiency.

Due to finite detector resolution there will be smearing effects and the reconstructed muon direction will be slightly different compared the true direction.

The cartoon showing our geometrical cone-cut criteria is given in Fig. 4. The higher energy neutrinos will have a narrower cone opening while lower energy ones will have a broader \u03b8 90 . Since the neutrino energy is determined by the mass of the annihilating WIMP, we expect the neutrino flux from annihilation of heavier WIMP to produce more muons peaked along the direction of the sun and hence have narrower cone angle \u03b8 90 than neutrino flux produced by lighter WIMP. For the same reason, \u03b8 90 for the \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 channel is expected to be smaller than \u03b8 90 for the bb channel. Likewise, among the channels considered, we expect the largest and smallest value of \u03b8 90 for gg and \u03bd\u03bd 3 respectively. Using WIMPSIM and GENIE, we calculate \u03b8 90 for each WIMP mass and for a given annihilation channel in the sun. Fig. 5 shows the \u03b8 90 calculated for the sun as a function of the WIMP mass (m \u03c7 ). The different lines correspond to different annihilation channels. For each WIMP mass and annihilation channel, we place \u03b8 90 cone around the neutrino direction and accept events that fall within this cone. As expected the cone-cut angle \u03b8 90 is smaller for the \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 channel compared to the bb channel since the former is harder compared to the latter. The \u03b8 90 for the antineutrinos is seen to be smaller since for the same energy, the \u00b5 + events from antineutrinos are seen to be more forward peaked compared to the \u00b5 \u2212 events coming from neutrinos.",

For the case of WIMP annihilation in the sun, the direction of the signal neutrinos is same as the direction of the sun. Since we are using a Monte-Carlo generated data for our analysis, we assign a weight to each of the background events, where the weight corresponds to the probability that a particular event has originated from the direction of the sun. We call the probability of the sun exposing a particular zenith and azimuth, for a given latitude and longitude at the earth, as the solar exposure probability.

Like-wise, Fig. 8(b) shows the corresponding events spectra and atmospheric neutrino background expected for the bb channel. As noted before, since the neutrino flux from the \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 channel is higher than the bb channel and since it also produces a harder neutrino spectrum, the signal event spectrum is higher for the former as well as harder for both neutrinos as well as antineutrinos. The atmospheric neutrino background too is lower for the \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 channel since a harder neutrino spectrum gives a smaller \u03b8 90 , improving the cone-cut background rejection employed in our analysis. Therefore, the signal to background ratio and hence the sensitivity to WIMP is expected to be better for the \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 channel, as we will see in the following sections. Fig. 8(c) shows the events due to cc annihilation channel. Since the fluxes from cc are only slightly lower in comparision to bb, the event distribution follows the similar trend. However, since the \u03b8 90 values for cc and bb channels are almost comparable for various WIMP masses, it would be difficult to distinguish between these two channels.

Note that ICAL is expected to be better than all other direct as well as indirect experiments which have placed limits on the WIMP-nucleon spin-dependent scattering cross-section. In particular, the sensitivity of the ICAL experiment is expected to be better   II Si [65] by brown hatched region at 90 % C.L. The limits on SI cross-sections from direct detection experiments are shown for SuperCDMS [66] (cyan dotted line), CDMSlite [67] (orange dotted), XENON-1T [68] (brown solid line) and LUX [69] (solid cyan line). The limits from Xenon-1T are currently the best limits on WIMP-nucleon SI cross-sections. Also shown are the less competitive limits from the indirect searches at IceCube [56] for \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 (cyan solid line) and bb (cyan dotted line) channels, and SK [15] for \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 (dark violet line) and bb (light violet line) channels. As for the SD cross-section case, we find that the expected sensitivity of ICAL is comparable to that from SK for both channels and better than the current limits from IceCube. It is worth pointing out that even though the limits on SI case from indirect detection experiments are expected to be poorer than from direct detection experiments, they provide an independent check on the WIMP parameters and can be used as a complementary probe of the WIMP paradigm. shown in Fig. 11 in the \u03c3 SD \u2212 m \u03c7 plane for the spin dependent cross-section. The green lines are for gg channel, orange lines for cc, blue for bb, violet for \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 , azure lines for \u03bd e\u03bde , black for \u03bd \u00b5\u03bd\u00b5 and red for \u03bd \u03c4\u03bd\u03c4 channel. Fig. 12 presents the 90 % C.L. expected sensitivity from 10 years of running of ICAL for the spin-independent cross-section, shown in the \u03c3 SI \u2212 m \u03c7 plane for different annihilation channels. The colour coding remains the same. For the reasons described in II, the expected sensitivity limit due to WIMP annihilating into neutrino-antineutrino channels is the strongest and weakest for the gg channel. This holds for both SD and SI case.",

The solid lines in this figure show the 90 % C.L. expected sensitivity of ICAL when systematic uncertainties are included. These were the expected limits shown in Figs. 9, 10, 11 and 12. The corresponding dashed lines are obtained by switching off the systematic uncertainties in the analysis. The orange lines are for \u03c3 SD and bb channel, the red lines are for \u03c3 SD and \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 channel, the azure lines are for \u03c3 SI and the bb channel, the magenta lines are for \u03c3 SI and \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 channel, the dark green lines for \u03c3 SD and \u03bd\u03bd channel and light green lines are for \u03c3 SI and \u03bd\u03bd channel. The impact of the systematic uncertainties for all the channels are seen to be more for lower WIMP masses. This is because the atmospheric neutrinos peak at lower energies and their fluxes fall as roughly E \u22122.7 \u03bd . Therefore, for lower WIMP masses, since the neutrino spectrum from WIMP annihilation are softer, these get more affected by the uncertainties in the atmospheric neutrino fluxes. The impact of the uncertainties is also seen to be more for the bb channel. The reason for this behaviour is again the same. We had seen in section II that the neutrino spectrum from the bb channel is softer. Similarly, the harder channels like \u03bd\u03bd and \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 have greater high energetic neutrino content. Therefore, the impact of the atmospheric neutrino background and also the uncertainty on the atmospheric neutrino background affect the softer channels more than the harder channels.",

            "text": "Finally, in Fig. 14 we illustrate the impact of varying branching ratios on sensitivity limits. It is clear from Fig. 2 that some channels are weaker in comparision to others and would yield a weaker sensitivity to indirect detection as shown in Fig. 11 and Fig. 12. However, these sensitivity limits are assuming 100% branching ratios for each of the annihilation channel. Therefore, the above sensitivity limit indicates the best limit one would expect at ICAL due to a particular channel considered. In nature, however, we would have a mixture of fluxes from different channels and correspondingly the sensitivity limits would be altered. For a given WIMP model, the branching ratio of a particular channel would be known and corresponding contribution in terms of neutrino fluxes can be easily calculated. In a framework of a particular model, therefore, the sensitivity due to this mixture of fluxes would get scaled appropriately. To illustrate this point, we consider two toy models and calculate their expected sensitivities at ICAL. We take two toy models restricted to three annihilation channels: Model A which has a following prediction : BR cc : BR bb : BR \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 = 20% : 60% : 20% and Model B which predicts BR cc : BR bb : BR \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 = 10% : 20% : 70%. We see from the Fig. 14 that sensitivity due to Model B (violet line) is more than Model A (red line), and it is expected since it has greater contribution from a 'harder channel which is \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 in this case. For both the models, sensitivites are indeed bounded by the strongest and the weakest channels which in this partcular case are \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 and cc respectively.",

We first fold these events with detector efficiency and charge identification efficiency. Next, in order to simulate the events in bins of measured muon energy and muon zenith angle, we fold them with the muon energy resolution functions and muon zenith angle resolution functions. We performed the ICAL detector simulation using the Geant4-based ICAL detector code to obtain the detector and charge identification efficiencies as well as the muon energy and angle resolution functions.

The detector and charge identification efficiencies as well as muon energy and zenith angle resolutions are functions of both true muon energy and true muon zenith angle. We presented our results on the ICAL detector response for higher energy muon in the atmospheric neutrino background. We first performed a generator-level simulation to find the opening angle between the signal neutrinos and the direction of the sun such that 90 % of the signal events were accepted. We presented these 90 % cone-cut angles \u03b8 90 as a function of the WIMP mass. Heavier WIMP produce higher energy neutrinos and hence have smaller cone-cut angles. This 90 % cone-cut criteria was then implemented on the atmospheric neutrino background, wherein the event was accepted or rejected depending on whether its zenith angle lied inside or outside the cone defined by \u03b8 90 . Since the cone-cut angle \u03b8 90 was found to be different for different WIMP mass, the atmospheric neutrino events accepted for the analysis was also different for different WIMP masses. Finally, since the sun spends a specific amount of time on a given zenith angle, we obtained the exposure function of the sun at the INO site and weighted the accepted atmospheric neutrino events with this exposure function to get the final reduced atmospheric neutrino background events as a function of the WIMP mass. We showed that the cone-cut acceptance method reduces the atmospheric neutrino background by a fact of 100.

In our convention, the cosine of the zenith 6 angle cos \u03b8 = 1 represents an upward going muon, whereas cos \u03b8 = \u22121 indicates a downward going muon. We take 37 E \u00b5 bins of variable bin-width between 1 and 100 GeV, finer bins for low energies and coarser for high energies, and 20 cos \u03b8 bins. A large number of events are generated for a fixed E \u00b5 and cos \u03b8, separately for \u00b5 + and \u00b5 \u2212 . The vertices of these events were smeared over the central region (as defined in [70]) of ICAL. In each case, the azimuthal angle (\u03c6) was uniformly averaged over the range \u2212\u03c0 \u2264 \u03c6 \u2264 \u03c0. A good reconstructed event is one that leaves a single track in the detector and crosses at least three consecutive RPC layers. A further condition \u03c7 2 /ndf < 10 is applied for choosing the reconstructed events. Reconstruction efficiency (\u03b5 rec ) for each \u00b5(E \u00b5 , cos \u0398) event is given by the ratio of total number of events properly reconstructed (\u03b7 rec ) and total number of events generated in the central region of the detector (\u03b7 total ) i.e. \u03b5 rec = \u03b7rec \u03b7 total . Fig. 15 shows the reconstruction efficiencies of the muon events as a function of E \u00b5 for various cos \u03b8 values. The left and right figures are for \u00b5 \u2212 and \u00b5 + respectively. We can see from the figure how the reconstruction efficiency depends on the true energy and true zenith angle of the muon. The efficiency is seen to initially rise with muon energy, reach a peak at about E \u00b5 \u223c 10 GeV, after which it is seen to fall albeit extremely slowly.",
