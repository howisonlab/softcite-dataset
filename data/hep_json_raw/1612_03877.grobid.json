Two searches, based on complementary techniques, are performed in all-jet final states that are characterized by a significant imbalance in transverse momentum. An additional search requires the presence of a charged lepton isolated from other activity in the event. The data were collected in 2015 at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV with the CMS detector and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 2.3 fb \u22121 . No statistically significant excess of events is found beyond the expected contribution from standard model processes. Exclusion limits are set in the context of simplified models of top or bottom squark pair production. Models with top and bottom squark masses up to 830 and 890 GeV, respectively, are probed for light neutralinos. For models with top squark masses of 675 GeV, neutralino masses up to 260 GeV are excluded at 95% confidence level.",

            "text": "The standard model (SM) has been extremely successful at describing particle physics phenomena. Nevertheless, it suffers from shortcomings such as the hierarchy problem [1][2][3][4][5][6], the need for fine-tuned cancellations of large quantum corrections to keep the Higgs boson mass near the electroweak scale. Supersymmetry (SUSY), based on a symmetry between bosons and fermions, is an attractive extension of the SM. A key feature of SUSY is the existence of a superpartner for every SM particle with the same quantum numbers, except for spin, which differs by one half unit. In R-parity conserving SUSY models [7,8], supersymmetric particles are created in pairs, and the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) is stable [9,10] and considered to be a candidate for dark matter [11]. Supersymmetry can potentially provide a \"natural\", i.e. not fine-tuned, solution to the hierarchy problem through the cancellation of quadratic divergences in pare-mail: cms-publication-committee-chair@cern.ch ticle and sparticle loop corrections to the Higgs boson mass. In natural SUSY models light top and bottom squarks with masses close to the electroweak scale are preferred.",

            "text": "This paper presents three complementary searches for direct production of a pair of top ( t 1 t 1 ) or bottom squarks ( b 1 b 1 ), where the subscript here denotes the less massive partner of the corresponding SM fermion's chirality states. The first search targets top squark pair production in the alljet final state, while the second focuses on the single-lepton final state. These two analyses were explicitly designed for complementarity, allowing for a combination of the results to enhance the sensitivity. The third search targets bottom squark pair production in the all-jet final state. The searches are performed using the data collected in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV with the CMS detector at the CERN LHC in 2015, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.3 fb \u22121 . The results of similar searches were previously reported by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations using proton-proton collisions at 7 and 8 TeV [12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20][21][22][23][24][25] and by the CDF and D0 collaborations in pp collisions at 1.96 TeV at the Fermilab Tevatron [26][27][28][29][30]. With the increase in LHC collision energy from 8 to 13 TeV, the cross section to produce signal events is enhanced by a factor of 8-12 for a top or bottom squark mass in the range 700-1000 GeV [31,32]. Therefore, new territory can be explored even with the relatively small amount of data collected in 2015. The CMS and ATLAS collaborations have already provided first exclusion results for these models in the all-jet and single-lepton final states [33][34][35][36]. Unlike the more generic searches for new phenomena presented by the CMS collaboration in Refs. [33][34][35], the searches described in this paper directly target top and bottom squark production through the design of search regions that exploit the specific characteristics of these signal models, for instance through the use of a top quark tagging algorithm in the top squark search in the all-jet final state to identify boosted hadronically decaying top quarks originating from top squark decays.",

            "text": "The decay modes of top squarks depend on the sparticle mass spectrum. Figure 1 illustrates the top and bottom squark Feynman diagrams for pair production of top and bottom squarks via the decay modes considered in this paper. The model with 50% branching fractions for t 1 \u2192 t ( * ) \u03c7 0 1 and t 1 \u2192 b \u03c7 \u00b1 1 \u2192 bW \u00b1 * \u03c7 0 1 decays leads to the final states in a-c decay modes explored in this paper. The simplest top squark decay modes are t 1 \u2192 t ( * ) \u03c7 0 1 and t 1 \u2192 b \u03c7 \u00b1 1 \u2192 bW \u00b1( * ) \u03c7 0 1 , with \u03c7 \u00b1 1 representing the lightest chargino, and with intermediate particles that can be virtual marked by asterisks. In these decay modes, the neutralino and charginos are mixtures of the superpartners of electroweak gauge and Higgs bosons, and \u03c7 0 1 is considered to be an LSP that escapes detection, leading to a potentially large transverse momentum imbalance in the detector. The two analyses of top squark pair production in the all-jet and single-lepton final states probe both of these t 1 decay modes. In the t 1 \u2192 t ( * ) \u03c7 0 1 decay mode, the top quark is produced off-shell when m \u2261 m t 1 \u2212 m \u03c7 0 1 < m t , while in the t 1 \u2192 b \u03c7 \u00b1 1 decay mode, the experimental signature is affected by the mass of the chargino. We consider a model in which both top squarks decay via the t 1 \u2192 t ( * ) \u03c7 0 1 decay mode. A second model in which the branching fraction for each of the two top squark decay modes is 50% is also considered, under the assumption of a compressed mass spectrum in which the mass of \u03c7 \u00b1 1 is only 5 GeV greater than that of \u03c7 0 1 , with the W bosons resulting from chargino decays consequently being produced heavily offshell. If m < m W , t 1 can decay through a four-body decay involving an SM fermion pair ff as t 1 \u2192 bff \u03c7 0 1 , or through a flavour changing neutral current decay t 1 \u2192 c \u03c7 0 1 . The analysis of bottom squark pair production considers the decay mode b 1 \u2192 b \u03c7 0 1 within the allowed phase space, and also probes top squark pair production in the t 1 \u2192 c \u03c7 0 1 decay scenario.",

Within the solenoid volume are an all-silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL), and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter (HCAL), each composed of a barrel and two endcap sections. Forward calorimeters extend the pseudorapidity (\u03b7) coverage provided by the barrel and endcap detectors. Muons are measured in gas-ionization detectors embedded in the steel flux-return yoke outside the solenoid. The first level of the CMS trigger system, composed of custom hardware processors, uses information from the calorimeters and muon detectors to select the most interesting events in a fixed time interval of less than 4 \u00b5s. The high-level trigger processor farm further decreases the event rate from around 100 kHz to around 1 kHz, before data storage. A more detailed description of the CMS detector, together with a definition of the coordinate system used and the relevant kinematic variables, can be found in Ref. [37].",

For a relativistic top quark with a Lorentz boost \u03b3 = E/m, the W boson and b quark produced in the top quark decay are expected to be separated by a distance R \u2261 \u221a ( \u03b7) 2 + ( \u03c6) 2 \u2248 2/\u03b3 (where \u03c6 is the azimuthal angle in radians). In cases where the W boson subsequently decays hadronically, the three resulting jets from the W boson decay and the hadronization of the b quark are likely to be merged into a single jet by a clustering algorithm with a distance parameter larger than 2/\u03b3 . To identify hadronically decaying top quarks with p T > 400 GeV, we therefore use jets reconstructed using the anti-k T algorithm with a distance parameter of 0.8 to try to cluster the top quark decay products into a single jet. The next step of top quark reconstruction is an attempt to decompose the candidate jet into at least three subjets with the help of the Cambridge-Aachen jet clustering algorithm [50,51], the invariant mass of which is required to be consistent with the top quark mass (140-250 GeV). The final requirement of top quark identification is that the minimum invariant mass of any pair of the three subjets with the highest p T must exceed 50 GeV. The efficiency of the CTT algorithm to identify jets originating from top quark decays is measured to be about 30-40% while the misidentification rate is found to be about 4-6%, depending on the p T of the top quark candidates. No disambiguation is performed between top quark candidates and jets reconstructed with a distance parameter of 0.4.",

The MadGraph 5_amc@nlo 2.2.2 generator [56] is used in leading-order (LO) mode to simulate events originating from tt, W+jets, Z+jets, \u03b3 +jets, and quantum chromodynamics multijet processes (QCD), as well as signal events, based on LO NNPDF3.0 [57] parton distribution functions (PDFs). Single top quark events produced in the t W channel and tt samples used in the single-lepton analysis are generated at next-to-leading order (NLO) with Powheg v2 [58][59][60][61], while rare SM processes such as ttZ and ttW are generated at NLO using the MadGraph 5_amc@nlo 2.2.2 program, using NLO NNPDF3.0 PDFs. Parton showering and hadronization is generated using Pythia8.205 [62]. The response of the CMS detector for the SM backgrounds is simulated via the Geant4 [63] package. The CMS fast simulation package [64] is used to simulate all signal samples, and is verified to provide results that are consistent with those obtained from the full Geant4-based simulation. Event reconstruction is performed in the same manner as for collision data. A nominal distribution of pileup interactions is used when producing the simulated samples. The samples are then reweighted to match the pileup profile observed in the collected data. The signal production cross sections are calculated using NLO with next-to-leading logarithm (NLL) soft-gluon resummation calculations [31]. The most precise cross section calculations are used to normalize the SM simulated samples, corresponding most often to next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) accuracy.",

The high-N j region in conjunction with the low threshold on the p T of selected jets improves sensitivity for signal models with soft decay products in the final state. In the high-M T (b 1,2 , p miss T ) category, requiring the presence of at least one top quark reconstructed by the CTT algorithm (N t \u2265 1) ensures a high-purity selection of signal events with highly boosted top quarks, at the sacrifice of some loss in signal efficiency.

The first method relies on a sample dominated by Z \u2192 +jets events, which has the advantage of accessing very similar kinematics to the Z \u2192 \u03bd\u03bd process, after correcting for the difference in acceptance between charged-lepton pairs and pairs of neutrinos, but is statistically limited in regions defined with stringent requirements on jets and E miss T . The second method utilizes \u03b3 +jets events that have a significantly larger production cross section than the Z \u2192 +jets process, but similar leading-order Feynman diagrams. The two main differences between the processes that must be taken into account, namely, different quark-boson couplings and the massive nature of the Z boson, become less important at large Z boson p T , which is the kinematic region we are probing in this search.",

Both leptons must also have |\u03b7| < 2.4. The \u03b3 +jets sample is collected through a singlephoton trigger, and consists of events containing photons with p T > 180 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.5. The transverse momentum of the dilepton or photon system is added vectorially to p miss T in each event of the corresponding data samples to emulate the kinematics of the Z \u2192 \u03bd\u03bd process.

To increase the purity of the Z \u2192 events, we require the dilepton invariant mass to lie within the Z boson mass window of 80 < M < 100 GeV. The normalization of the nonnegligible tt contamination is estimated in the region outside the Z boson mass window (20 < M < 80 or M > 100 GeV) and taken into account.

The first term constrains the W boson whose lepton decay product is the detected lepton, while the second term constrains the top quark for which the lepton from the W boson decay is lost in the reconstruction. Once again, we consider all possible pairings of b jet candidates with up to three jets with highest CSV discriminator values. The calculation of modified topness uses the resolution parameters a W = 5 GeV and a t = 15 GeV, which determine the relative weighting of the mass shell conditions. We select events with t mod > 6.4. The definition of topness used in this analysis is modified from the one originally proposed in Ref. [69]: namely, the terms corresponding to the detected leptonic top quark decay and the centre-of-mass energy are dropped since in events with low jet multiplicity the second b jet is often not identified. In these cases, the discriminating power of the topness variable is reduced when a light-flavour jet is used instead in the calculation. The modified topness is more robust against such effects and provides better signal sensitivity in these SRs than the M W T2 variable. The distribution of modified topness for events with at least two jets is shown in Fig. 4 (bottom).",

We also require that the two highestp T jets be identified as b jets. These requirements suppress events originating from W and Z boson production, for which the leading jets have a softer p T spectrum since they are produced by ISR or FSR. To maintain a stable b tagging efficiency as a function of jet p T , both the loose and medium working points of the b tagging algorithm are used to identify b jets. The b tagging efficiency of the medium working point depends strongly on the jet p T and degrades by about 20-30% for jets with p T above 500 GeV, while the efficiency of the loose working point is more stable with increasing jet p T . Specifically, we use the loose working point to identify b-tagged jets when the leading jet has p T above 500 GeV, and the medium working point otherwise. Since such highp T jets are less likely to occur in SM processes, the higher misidentification rate of the loose working point results in only a small increase in the SM background.",

Differences in the efficiencies for selecting isolated leptons between simulation and data are measured in Z \u2192 events in the case of electrons and muons and in a tt-enriched sample for hadronically decaying \u03c4 leptons. The observed deviations are accounted for in the form of corrections to the simulation, and the cor-responding uncertainties are propagated to the predicted SM yields in the SRs. Correction factors and uncertainties based on measurements of b tagging performance in data and simulation [44] are also applied. They are parameterized by jet kinematics and flavour. We also assess an uncertainty related to the modelling of additional interactions in the simulation. For the rare SM backgrounds with top quarks, predominantly from tt production in association with a Z boson, where the Z boson decays to a pair of neutrinos, an extra uncertainty is estimated to account for the possible mismodelling of the top quark p T spectrum. The efficiency and misidentification rates for the top quark tagging algorithm are compared between data and simulation in CRs as a function of the key kinematic variables. The correction factors are found not to be strongly dependent on the different kinematic variables. The efficiency estimated in simulation agrees with the measured efficiency while the misidentification rate has to be corrected by 30%. Both correction factors have a 10% uncertainty, estimated from the variations of the efficiency measurement.",

The back- ground predictions from control samples in data are affected through the transfer factors that are calculated from simulation corrected to reproduce data. In general these uncertainties are subdominant and the uncertainty in the final background estimate is dominated by the statistical uncertainty of the data control sample. For the signal samples differences between the fast simulation and the full Geant4-based model are also taken into account. Lepton selection efficiencies and b tagging performance are found to be different in the fast simulation. We derive appropriate corrections for the fast simulation and propagate the corresponding uncertainties to the predicted signal yields. We also assess an additional uncertainty for the difference in E miss T resolution between the fast simulation and the full Geant4-based model. This difference in E miss T resolution has the largest impact on signal models with small intrinsic E miss T , as is the case for compressed mass spectra. The modelling of the ISR plays an important role in cases where the top squark and \u03c7 0 1 masses are very similar. The uncertainty is determined by comparing the simulated and observed p T spectra of the system recoiling against the ISR jets in tt events, using the method described in Ref. [21]. The effect is generally found to be small, although in scenarios with a compressed mass spectrum the effect can be as large as 30%.",

We combine the results of the two searches, treating the systematic uncertainties assigned to the predicted signal and background yields as correlated or uncorrelated depending on the source, as detailed in Sect. 7. Figure 7 shows 95% CL exclusion limits for pp \u2192 t 1 t 1 \u2192 t ( * ) \u03c7 0 1 t ( * ) \u03c7 0 1 , assuming the top quarks in the decay to be unpolarized, together with the upper limit at 95% CL on the excluded signal cross section. All top squarks are assumed to decay to a top quark and an LSP. For m < m t the signal samples assume a three-body decay without an off-shell top quark as intermediate particle. The expected exclusion is given by the dashed red line, with the one SD experimental uncertainty. The observed exclusion curve is shown as a solid black line together with the 1 SD uncertainty in the theoretical cross section. We do not interpret in the region near m \u2248 m t when \u03c7 0 1 is very light because of the difficulty in modelling rapidly varying kinematics in this region. In this region an indirect search for top squark pair production can be performed by looking for a small excess in the measured tt cross section compared to the SM expectation [20,85]. We exclude top squark masses from 280 to 830 GeV for a massless LSP and LSP masses up to 260 for 675 GeV top squarks. At 8 TeV top squark masses were excluded up to 780 GeV for a massless LSP [25]. For models with heavy top squarks and light LSPs, the sensitivity is driven by the top squark analysis in the all-jet final state of Sect. 4, which is more sensitive than the single-lepton analysis (Sect. 5) because of the larger acceptance for signal. The combination extends the expected reach in top squark mass by about 45 GeV. When the LSP is heavier, the cleaner search in the single-lepton final state becomes more important. Both analyses have similar sensitivity in this area of parameter space, and combining them extends the reach in LSP mass by about 30 GeV. Figure 8 shows the 95% CL exclusion limits for t 1 t 1 production, assuming equal probabilities for the decay modes t 1 \u2192 t ( * ) \u03c7 0 1 and t 1 \u2192 b \u03c7 \u00b1 1 . The chargino in the latter mode decays to a W boson and an LSP. In this model, the chargino is considered to be nearly mass-degenerate with the LSP (m analysis does not contribute much to the combination because of the larger acceptance in the all-jet final state, except at low LSP masses. In most of the mass parameter space the combination reaches \u224815 GeV higher than the analysis in the all-jet final state.",

The pairing that gives the lowest value of M W T2 defines the final estimate. The reconstruction of an event using the M W T2 variable helps discriminate signal from the dominant dilepton tt background. For large mass differences between the top squark and the neutralino, the M W T2 > 200 GeV requirement significantly reduces the background while maintaining reasonable signal efficiency. In contrast, for smallm models, such a requirement results in a significant loss in signal efficiency.
