The measurement is performed in final states containing one electron and missing transverse momentum using data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 20.2 fb \u22121 . Differential cross sections for events with at least one or two jets are presented for a range of observables, including jet transverse momenta and rapidities, the scalar sum of transverse momenta of the visible particles and the missing transverse momentum in the event, and the transverse momentum of the W boson. For a subset of the observables, the differential cross sections of positively and negatively charged W bosons are measured separately. In the cross-section ratio of W + /W \u2212 the dominant systematic uncertainties cancel out, improving the measurement precision by up to a factor of nine. The observables and ratios selected for this paper provide valuable input for the up quark, down quark, and gluon parton distribution functions of the proton.",

            "text": "With the large samples of proton-proton collision data available from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the measurement of the production of a W boson in association with jets allows precise tests of perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD). In recent years, numerous theoretical advances have been made including calculations for up to five additional jets at next-to-leading-order (NLO) [1][2][3] and calculations for one additional jet at next-to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO) [4,5], as well as merging approaches for NLO predictions of different jet multiplicities [6][7][8] and new parton shower approaches [9,10]. The theoretical predictions have undergone rigorous scrutiny using data from the ATLAS, CMS and LHCb experiments [11][12][13][14][15][16] with proton-proton collisions at the LHC and from the CDF and D\u00d8 experiments with proton-antiproton collisions at the Tevatron [17][18][19][20]. These results comprise a wide range of measurements of differential cross sections of observables, which are reconstructed from jets and leptonic decay products of the W boson. Detailed measurements of specific processes such as electroweak W boson production [21], small-angle emission of a W boson radiating from an energetic jet [22] and production in association with heavy-flavour quarks [23-28] complement these results. All of the studies mentioned here focus on jet production over a range of energy scales and attempt to probe pQCD to the statistical limits of the available data.",

These observables are sensitive to higher-order terms in the prediction as well as the parton distribution functions (PDFs). For events with at least two jets, the differential cross sections are shown for W boson production and include distributions as a function of the p T and rapidity of the second leading jet, the dijet angular separation, and the dijet invariant mass.

The new measurements are based on an independent dataset, at a higher centre-of-mass energy and with larger integrated luminosity. The analysis has improved event selections to reduce backgrounds from top quark productionan important improvement since the increase in cross section with centre-of-mass energy is greater for top quark production than for W boson production.

The inner detector covers the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 2.5. It consists of silicon pixel, silicon microstrip, and transition radiation tracking detectors.

The muon spectrometer surrounds the calorimeters and includes a system of precision tracking chambers and fast detectors for triggering. Three large air-core toroidal superconducting magnets, each with eight coils, provide the magnetic field for the muon system. In 2012, a three-level trigger system was used to select events. The first-level trigger was implemented in hardware and used a subset of the detector information to reduce the accepted event rate to at most 75 kHz.

For electromagnetic final-state radiation and the decay of \u03c4 -leptons, Photos [40] and Tauola [41] were used, respectively. Double counting of parton emissions between the Alpgen matrix element and the Pythia parton shower calculations was removed through the MLM matching scheme [35]. The proton structure is described by the CTEQ6L1 PDF set [42]. The Alpgen samples include a matrix element calculation of W boson production in association with massive heavy-flavour partons, W + c, W + cc and W + bb in addition to the light-flavour jet production. Overlap between heavy-flavour quarks originating from the matrix element and those originating from the parton shower was removed. For the Sherpa samples, events were produced with up to four additional partons in the final state from the matrix element and include a model of the parton shower, the hadronisation and the underlying event. The ME+PS@LO prescription [43] is used to combine different parton multiplicities from the matrix element and the parton shower. The Sherpa event generator uses the CKKW matching scheme [44] and its own model of electromagnetic final-state radiation based on the Yennie-Frautschi-Suura method [45]. Massive c-and b-quarks are also included and the PDF set used is CT10 [46]. The Alpgen+Pythia 6 samples for W + jets production provide the best description of data and are used as the main signal prediction throughout this measurement. The Sherpa samples supply an alternative prediction and are used to estimate some of the systematic uncertainties.",

The h damp parameter, which effectively regulates high-p T emission in Powheg was set to the top quark mass of 172.5 GeV. Single top quark production in the s-, t-and W t-channels was modelled by Powheg and showered with Pythia v6.426 (v6.427 for the t-channel) using the Perugia 2011C tune. The PDF set is CT10 (with a fixed 4-flavour scheme for t-channel production).

The number of multijet background events is estimated by fitting, for each jet JHEP05(2018)077 multiplicity, the E miss T distribution in the data (without the E miss T requirement, but all other signal region requirements applied) to a sum of two templates: one for the multijet background and another which includes the signal and all other backgrounds. The normalisation of both templates is allowed to vary freely. The shape of the multijet template is obtained from data, while the second template is obtained from simulation. The multijet-enriched data sample used to extract the multijet template is acquired using a dedicated electron trigger, an inverted electron identification criterion, and an inverted isolation criterion. The electron trigger is equivalent to the one used for the signal region, but does not contain an isolation requirement. The inverted identification requires that the electron passes the medium criteria but fails the tight criteria, and the inverted isolation that the sum of the p T of tracks in a cone of \u2206R = 0.3 around the electron, excluding the electron track, is larger than 7% of the electron's p T . To increase the number of events in the multijet-enriched sample the electron impact parameter criteria are not applied. The multijet-enriched data sample is statistically independent from the signal region and any contribution from the signal or other backgrounds to this sample is subtracted using simulation.",

Migrations between bins that occur during the reconstruction of events are corrected for using an iterative Bayesian unfolding method [85,86] with two iterations. In addition corrections for events that are outside the fiducial region but are reconstructed within the signal region or events that are not reconstructed due to detector inefficiencies are included. The correction procedure includes an extrapolation from the signal region, which has a veto on events with b-tagged jets, to the fiducial region, which does not. W boson production in association with cand b-quarks is 18% of the combined fiducial cross section for N jets \u2265 1. This reduces by only 2% in the signal region from the b-tagged jet veto because, in events with one jet, contributions from W + c production are larger and these contributions are only slightly affected by this veto. The extrapolation therefore has a small effect compared to other corrections, such as the one accounting for the electron identification efficiency. For differential distributions, the unfolding is performed in two dimensions, one of which is always the jet multiplicity. In this way, migrations between jet multiplicity bins, which can be large, are considered. Migrations in E miss T compose a large part of the correction in and out of the fiducial region, in particular for zero-jet events, and are accounted for by the procedure. Other migrations, for example those in m T are also included but are small. Differential cross sections for a given jet multiplicity, such as N jets \u2265 1, are obtained by summing over the contributing jet multiplicities in the two-dimensional result.",

The uncertainty in the JES varies as a function of the jet p T and \u03b7 and is approximately 3.5% for central jets with p T > 30 GeV and decreases to about 1% for central jets with p T > 100 GeV. For forward jets, the JES uncertainty is almost twice as large as for central jets, mainly due to the uncertainties in the jet-\u03b7intercalibration [73]. In the analysis, jet energies are shifted in simulated events by the size of the JES uncertainty component, and the event selection, including a recalculation of E miss T and m T , is re-evaluated. The full analysis chain, which includes the background estimates and the unfolding, is repeated and the change in the cross section with respect to the nominal is taken as the systematic uncertainty. For a given source, the average of the up and down variations is taken as the symmetric uncertainty. The impact of the JES uncertainties on the cross section ranges from 8% to 55% for N jets \u2265 1 to N jets \u2265 7 but decreases for the W + /W \u2212 cross-section ratio to below 1% and up to 17% for N jets \u2265 1 to N jets \u2265 6.

The uncertainty in the shape of the multijet template is estimated JHEP05(2018)077 by varying separately both the inverted isolation criteria and the inverted identification of the electron used to select the multijet-enriched data sample. The influence of the signal template in the E miss T fit is determined by using the Sherpa simulation instead of Alp-gen+Pythia 6 for the modelling of W + jets production. The impact due to statistical uncertainties in the templates is evaluated by creating a thousand pseudo-data samples drawn from the templates and refitting the data with each. Uncertainties due to the fit procedure are estimated by varying the lower and upper bound of the fit range separately, as well as changing the binning used in the fit. The statistical uncertainty in the fit parameters is also included. The uncertainty in the W cross section from these sources ranges from less than 1% to about 12% for N jets \u2265 0 to N jets \u2265 7; the largest contributions to the uncertainty are due to the fit range variation, the modification of the inverted electron identification, the choice of W + jets generator, and, at higher jet multiplicities, the statistical uncertainties. The uncertainty in the W + /W \u2212 cross-section ratio ranges from less than 1% to 27% for N jets \u2265 0 to N jets \u2265 6 and is larger than that of the W boson measurement due to statistical uncertainties from the fit as well as the inverted electron identification and the fit range uncertainties that do not fully cancel out in the ratio.",

Additional uncertainties in the modelling of the shape of the distributions are not considered. Backgrounds from single top quark, diboson and Z boson production are small, and the impact of the cross-section uncertainties is minimal, therefore any modelling uncertainties are negligible. For the tt background, the theoretical uncertainties only have a noticeable effect in the N jets distribution for events with 5-7 jets where tt production is a significant contribution. The impact of tt background modelling uncertainties is crosschecked by comparing to an alternative tt prediction from MC@NLO+Herwig [93]. The results from this prediction are well covered by other uncertainties, except for in events with N jets \u2265 7 where this prediction is known to have large differences from the data in the tt-enriched data sample.

All the kinematic selections listed in table 2 are applied except for the jet rapidity requirement, which is |y| < 2.5 for the leading jet for this calculation. In order to compare the N jetti results to the data, the ratio of events selected using a leading jet rapidity criterion of |y| < 4.4 to events using a criterion of |y| < 2.5 is estimated with the Alpgen+Pythia 6 simulation as a function of each differential observable and applied as a correction to the N jetti results. The size of this correction is around 10% to 15% at low p T of the W boson and of the jets as well as at low H T and decreases to zero at around 200 GeV to 250 GeV in p T (and at around 500 GeV for H T ). For the differential cross section as function of the second leading jet's rapidity, the correction is approximately constant at 10%. Uncertainties in this correction factor include statistical uncertainties from the Alpgen+Pythia 6 sample and the change in the correction when using the Sherpa 1.4.1 generator. The theoretical uncertainties in the NNLO prediction are obtained by multiplying and dividing \u00b5 o by a factor of two.",

These predictions use the CT10 NLO PDF set and the choice of renormalisation and factorisation scale is H T /2, where H T is the scalar sum of the transverse momenta of the W boson and the jets. The theoretical uncertainties considered include uncertainties due to the PDF error set and uncertainties due to the choice of scale, which are evaluated by independently varying the renormalisation and factorisation scales up and down by a factor of two. For W + 1-jet production, the BlackHat+Sherpa matrix elements are also used in the exclusive sums approach [94], in which NLO information from W + 2-jet production is utilised.

For W production, there is good agreement between the data and most LO predictions as well as the N jetti NNLO calculation.

The Alpgen predictions vary slightly for different parton shower models, with Pythia providing a better description of the data. In the ratio of W + /W \u2212 , where the experimental precision is greatly improved, neither of these predictions describe the data well. Most predictions (except N jetti NNLO and Sherpa 1.4.1) overestimate the data between one to almost four times the experimental uncertainties. This effect is largest for Alpgen and consistent with the offset seen for Alpgen in figure 2 (right) for events with one jet.

The N jetti , Alpgen and LO Sherpa 1.4.1 predictions show fair agreement with the data for both distributions. The Sherpa 2.2.1 calculations for both NLO and LO as well as BlackHat+Sherpa tend to predict a softer p T distribution. These differences contrast with those observed in W +dijet production [21] in the leading jet p T for events with at least two jets. In that paper, the event selection requires a larger leading jet p T and a dijet invariant mass greater than 500 GeV. With this selection, the predictions tend to overestimate the cross section.

In the forward region, the data turn down more sharply at |y| \u2248 3.6 compared to a smoothly falling   distribution. The experimental uncertainties, which in this region are dominated by the difference between Alpgen and Sherpa in the unfolding and the jet energy scale and resolution uncertainties, cover this effect. Most theory calculations predict a larger cross section for forward jets than that observed in the data and lie within 1-2 times the experimental uncertainties. The parton shower model strongly influences the calculated cross section in the high rapidity region, as seen through the comparison of Alpgen+Pythia 6 and Alpgen+Herwig. In addition, different PDF sets can affect the predicted cross section at high jet rapidities, but to a smaller extent (as can be seen by comparing with figure 24 in appendix A). The mismodelling in the forward region, however, largely cancels out in the ratio of W + /W \u2212 , resulting in good agreement with data. It can be noticed that Sherpa underpredicts the ratio at high rapidities, and Alpgen overpredicts the data around |y| \u2248 2.4. The W + /W \u2212 cross-section ratios for the above four observables (H T , W boson p T , leading jet p T and leading jet rapidity) are compared in figure 7 to NLO MCFM predictions with four different PDF sets: CT10, HERAPDF 1.5, MSTW 2008, and NNPDF 2.3. The theoretical uncertainties for the MCFM prediction are displayed only for the CT10 PDF set. As seen in the figure, the MCFM predictions vary depending on the PDF set used. These variations are largest for the p T of the W boson and at forward jet rapidities. In the region of 200 GeV to 400 GeV in the distribution of the p T of the W boson, where experimental uncertainties in the ratio are small (around 2% to 6%), the predictions from the four PDF sets differ by about 2% to 5% and are, in some cases, up to 2-3 times   Figure 6.

The description of the ratio by the Powheg +Pythia 8 predictions is similar to that from the BlackHat+Sherpa exclusive sums method.

Corrections to the differential cross section from electroweak radiation calculated at NLO in \u03b1 QED grow for increasing values of H T , leading jet p T and the p T of the W boson, resulting in a reduction of the predicted cross section of up to 30% to 80% depending on the distribution (the distributions are shown in figures 21-23 in appendix A). The inclusion of these corrections to Sherpa 2.2.1 leads to a larger disagreement with the data.

These observables test hard parton radiation at large angles and matrix-element/parton-shower matching  schemes. Jet production in the forward region can also be very sensitive to the tuning of the underlying event's contribution. BlackHat+Sherpa describes the data well for both distributions even at large dijet invariant masses, with a cross section slightly higher than in the data at low invariant mass. This leads to the small observed offset in the \u2206R jet1,jet2 distribution, which is dominated by this low m jet1,jet2 region. The Sherpa 1.4.1 generator predicts too many events at large angular separations and high dijet invariant masses. As a result, this prediction greatly overestimates the data in the highest bin of the \u2206R jet1,jet2 distribution, which includes all higher values beyond the shown \u2206R jet1,jet2 range. Both LO and NLO Sherpa 2.2.1 describe the data better, in particular, the dijet invariant mass distribution. In Sherpa 1.4.1, considerable improvement in the description of this observable is found when requiring a larger p T of the leading jet. The Alpgen predictions describe large invariant masses well, but deteriorate for small and large angular separations between the leading two jets. Differences between the Alpgen predictions with two different parton shower models are small for both distributions. For electroweak production of the W boson, which becomes larger for dijet invariant masses above 1 TeV, a dedicated measurement with an optimised selection has been performed using data at \u221a s = 7 TeV and \u221a s = 8 TeV [21].

The selected differential distributions focus on W production in association with one or two jets and are sensitive tests of perturbative QCD, the modelling of the parton shower and the parton structure of the proton. The W + /W \u2212 cross-section ratio can be measured to high precision as many of the experimental and theoretical uncertainties cancel out.",

            "text": "Overall, the measured distributions show that NNLO and NLO predictions are able to describe the data. However, at high transverse momenta, large jet rapidities, or large dijet angular separations, many of these predictions underestimate or overestimate the cross sections. In many places, multi-leg LO generators, such as Alpgen and Sherpa, which consider a larger number of parton emissions from the matrix element calculation, model the data best, although with large theoretical uncertainties. There is, however, no single prediction that is able to describe all distributions well. The H T , jet rapidity, and dijet invariant mass distributions are in general the least well described, suggesting that better modelling of events with energetic jets as well as jets with large rapidities is needed. In the W + /W \u2212 cross-section ratios, additional features in the description of the data by the predictions emerge; agreement for Alpgen worsens, but in many places improves for others. The choice of parton distribution functions can, in some cases, modify the predicted W + /W \u2212 cross-section ratio by about the experimental uncertainty.",
