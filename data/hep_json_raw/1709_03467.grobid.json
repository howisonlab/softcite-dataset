The measurement uses 818 pb \u22121 of e + e \u2212 collision data that is taken at the \u03c8(3770) resonance and collected by the CLEO-c experiment. The measurement is important for the determination of the CP -violating phase \u03b3 in B \u00b1 \u2192 DK \u00b1 (and similar) decays, where the D meson (which represents a superposition of D 0 and D 0 ) subsequently decays to \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 . To obtain optimal sensitivity to \u03b3, the phase space of the D \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decay is divided into bins based on a recent amplitude model of the decay. Although an amplitude model is used to define the bins, the measurements obtained are model-independent. The CP -even fraction of the D \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decay is determined to be F 4\u03c0 + = 0.769 \u00b1 0.021 \u00b1 0.010, where the uncertainties are statistical and systematic, respectively. Using simulated B \u00b1 \u2192 DK \u00b1 , D \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decays, it is estimated that by the end of the current LHC run, the LHCb experiment could determine \u03b3 from this decay mode with an uncertainty of (\u00b110 \u00b1 7) \u2022 , where the first uncertainty is statistical based on estimated LHCb event yields, and the second is due to the uncertainties on the parameters determined in this paper.",

The relative magnitudes can be determined by measuring D * + \u2192 D 0 \u03c0 + decays that are subsequently followed by a D 0 \u2192 f decay; this is possible at a large variety of collider experiments, such as LHCb and the B-factories. Measuring the relative phase, however, is more challenging. One method is to infer the relative phase through use of an amplitude model; in principle this is the best way to exploit the available statistics, but theoretical uncertainties in determining the model can lead to large systematic uncertainties on \u03b3. The relative phase can also be determined model-independently by using samples of D \u2192 f decays, where the D meson is in a known superposition of D 0 and D 0 states. Previously, such data samples have been obtained from two sources: correlated DD pairs from the decay of a \u03c8(3770) meson [6,[9][10][11][12][13][14][15] (the first charmonia resonance above the charm threshold); and the decay D * + \u2192 D\u03c0 + , where the superposition of D 0 and D 0 states depends on the D meson decay-time [16][17][18]. In this paper we determine the relative magnitude and phase of D 0 \u2192 4\u03c0 \u00b1 and D 0 \u2192 4\u03c0 \u00b1 amplitudes using \u03c8(3770) decays collected by the CLEO-c experiment.",

The parameter space that describes these final state configurations is known as the phase space of the decay. For the 4\u03c0 \u00b1 final state, a phase space-integrated measurement was performed in ref. [19] to determine the CP -content of the inclusive decay, and then applied in a B \u00b1 \u2192 DK \u00b1 study at LHCb [20]. However, to better exploit the information available in multi-body D decays, the phase space can be divided into bins such that regions of constructive and destructive interference do not dilute each other. Such a method has already been applied to the K 0 S \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 final state [21] which gives the best single measurement of \u03b3 to date [22]; here an amplitude-model was used to group regions of phase space that have a similar phase difference between D 0 \u2192 K 0 S \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and D 0 \u2192 K 0 S \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 amplitudes [23]. Recently an amplitude model for D \u2192 4\u03c0 \u00b1 has become available [24], so in this paper a similar technique is applied to the 4\u03c0 \u00b1 final state. It is important to note that although the binning scheme is defined by an amplitude model, this will not result in any model-dependent bias. If the model is incorrect, this will just result in an increased statistical uncertainty.",

To best exploit the symmetries of the self-conjugate 4\u03c0 \u00b1 final state, phase space bins are defined in pairs that map to each other under the CP operation. The bins are labeled such that bin +i is paired with bin \u2212i, therefore, for any point p in +i, the CP conjugate point p will fall into bin \u2212i. This choice of binning means that the following relations exist between the hadronic parameters of +i and \u2212i bins: Since the relative magnitude and phase of A 4\u03c0 p and\u0100 4\u03c0 p varies over the D \u2192 4\u03c0 \u00b1 phase space, so will the relative size of the interference term in B \u00b1 \u2192 DK \u00b1 , D \u2192 4\u03c0 \u00b1 decays. If a single bin contains regions of phase space with differing levels of interference (for example, constructive and destructive interference) the overall interference is diluted, and the sensitivity to \u03b3 is reduced. It is therefore preferable for both r 4\u03c0 p = |A 4\u03c0 p /\u0100 4\u03c0 p | and \u2206\u03b4 4\u03c0 p = arg(A 4\u03c0 p /\u0100 4\u03c0 p ) to be approximately constant within each bin. This is possible by using an amplitude model to assign each point in phase space a value of r 4\u03c0 p and \u2206\u03b4 4\u03c0 p , which are used to determine the bin number. Although a model is used to determine the bin number, this will not introduce any model-dependent systematic uncertainties, since the hadronic parameters will still be determined model-independently. An incorrect model will only lead to a non-optimal binning, and an increased statistical uncertainty.",

An adaptive binning algorithm is used to create a hyper-binning scheme. At the beginning of the algorithm one hypervolume is defined with corners {m min , m min , 0, 0, 0} and {m max , m max , 1, 1, \u03c0}. At each iteration of the algorithm, the hypervolumes from the previous iteration are split in two, choosing to split in the dimension that has the fastest varying \u2206\u03b4 4\u03c0 p , and picking a split point that is as close as possible to one of the bin boundaries defined in eq. (4.1). The algorithm runs until either: splitting a hypervolume will always result in two hypervolumes with the same bin number; splitting a hypervolume will always result in a hypervolume that has an edge length narrower than the minimum allowed. Several minimum edge lengths were tested and the values {39 MeV, 39 MeV, 0.06, 0.06, 0.19 rad} were chosen since this results in a reasonable number of volumes (\u223c 250, 000) while reproducing the parameters c i and s i to within 2% compared to a binning scheme that uses the model directly.

Therefore, the arithmetic-mean of the hadronic parameters from all alternative models is used as the model prediction, and the covariance of the results is used to determine a model-uncertainty. To determine the statistical and systematic uncertainties, the hadronic parameters are calculated many times using the baseline model, each time varying the model parameters within their statistical and systematic uncertainties.

In ref. [19] any \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 pair with an invariant mass in the range [0.470, 0.530] GeV is required to have a reconstructed vertex that is compatible with the e + e \u2212 collision point. In this paper, any \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 pair with an invariant mass in the range [0.480, 0.505] GeV is rejected, regardless of its compatibility with the e + e \u2212 collision point. The 4\u03c0 \u00b1 phase space bins defined in section 4 have the same region of phase space removed, so no corrections to the measured hadronic parameters are needed. In addition to the tags in ref. [19], this analysis also uses the flavour-tags K \u2213 e \u00b1 \u03bd, and the quasi-flavour-tags K \u2213 \u03c0 \u00b1 , K \u2213 \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03c0 0 and K \u2213 \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03c0 \u2213 \u03c0 \u00b1 .

The \u03b3 uncertainties are also compared between different binning scheme types with N = 5; all result in similar values of \u03c3 stat (\u03b3), although the values of \u03c3 had (\u03b3) are notably larger for the 'variable \u2206\u03b4  'alternative' binning schemes.

Currently BESIII have collected 2.9 fb \u22121 of e + e \u2212 collisions at the \u03c8(3770) resonance, and a further \u223c 7 fb \u22121 is planned for the future. These datasets correspond to approximately 3.5 and 12 times the amount collected by CLEO-c, respectively. It is assumed that the uncertainties on the 4\u03c0 \u00b1 hadronic parameters would be reduced by 1/ \u221a 3.5 and 1/ \u221a 12, respectively, compared to the constraints obtained in section 8. The central values of the estimated BESIII measurements are different for each simulated dataset, and are randomly sampled from the constraints obtained in section 8. Figure 12.

Figure 13 shows, for the default binning scheme, the expected values of \u03c3 had (\u03b3) for different numbers of B \u00b1 \u2192 DK \u00b1 , D \u2192 4\u03c0 \u00b1 decays. This is shown for the hadronic parameter constraints measured in this paper, and the expected constraints for the two BESIII data taking periods. With 10.0 fb \u22121 of BESIII data, the expected \u03b3 uncertainties become (18 \u2295 3) \u2022 , (10 \u2295 1.7) \u2022 and (2.5 \u2295 1.2) \u2022 for the LHCb \"Run I\", \"Run II\" and \"Phase 1 Upgrade\" scenarios, respectively. It is also possible that BESIII could make further gains in sensitivity by using additional numbers of phase space bins. Improved constraints on the 4\u03c0 \u00b1 hadronic parameters could be obtained using D-mixing, as has been done for the K \u00b1 \u03c0 \u2213 \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03c0 \u2213 final state in ref.

Details of the simulation and fitting procedure can be found in the text. The uncertainties are given for three different data taking periods of the LHCb experiment, where the number of signal decays in each case it taken/extrapolated from existing measurements. The uncertainty on \u03b3 comes from two sources: the uncertainty due to limited B \u00b1 \u2192 DK \u00b1 , D \u2192 4\u03c0 \u00b1 statistics, \u03c3 stat (\u03b3); and the uncertainty due to limited knowledge of the 4\u03c0 \u00b1 hadronic parameters that are measured in this paper, \u03c3 had (\u03b3). Both uncertainties are shown in the table, and are given in the format (\u03c3 stat (\u03b3) \u2295 \u03c3 had (\u03b3)).

Expected \u03b3 uncertainties obtained using different numbers of B \u00b1 \u2192 DK \u00b1 , D \u2192 4\u03c0 \u00b1 decays and the default binning scheme. The black line shows the estimated uncertainty due to limited B \u00b1 \u2192 DK \u00b1 , D \u2192 4\u03c0 \u00b1 statistics. The red, green and blue lines shows the estimated uncertainty due to the measured/predicted constraints on the 4\u03c0 \u00b1 hadronic parameters from CLEOc data with 0.818 fb \u22121 , BES III with 2.9 fb \u22121 , and BES III with 10.0 fb \u22121 , respectively. The grey bands highlight the event numbers that correspond to different LHCb data taking periods.",

The first uncertainty is due to limited B \u00b1 \u2192 DK \u00b1 statistics, and the second is due to uncertainties on the 4\u03c0 \u00b1 hadronic parameters.

At iteration 0, there is one hypervolume; at iteration 1, this gets split to give two hypervolumes; at iteration 2 each of these gets split to give 4 hypervolumes etc. Rather than discard the hypervolumes from iteration 0 and iteration 1, these can be kept to speed up the binning process later. The final set of hypervolumes that come out of the binning algorithm are known as 'bins' (B). Other hypervolumes that were used during the binning algorithm (but were then further divided) are known simply as 'volumes' (V). The first volume from iteration 0 is known as the primary volume (PV). A simple example of a 2 dimensional binning scheme, iteration-by-iteration, is given in figure 14, with bins and volumes labelled. Each volume and bin has a unique identifier called a 'volume number'. Every volume has links to two volume numbers, whereas each bin has a bin content (which gives the phase space bin number). The simple binning scheme in figure 14 is described by the information in figure 15, which has the same format as hypbinningwlinks.txt. For comparison, the same binning scheme is described in the same format as hypbinning.txt in figure 16.",
