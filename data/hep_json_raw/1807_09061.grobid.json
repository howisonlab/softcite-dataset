            "text": "Particle production at LHC energies involves the interplay of hard (perturbative) and soft (non-perturbative) QCD processes. Global observables, such as the charged-particle multiplicity, are related to the initial geometry and the energy density produced in the collision. They are important to characterise relativistic heavy-ion collisions and to constrain model calculations. The LHC produced Xenon-Xenon collisions for the first time in October 2017. New results on the primary charged-particle pseudorapidity density, and its pseudorapidity and centrality dependence are presented for this lighter and deformed nucleus, and compared to measurements obtained for lead ions. New results will also be presented for p-Pb collisions at the highest energy of 8.16 TeV, as part of an overview of all the measurements at LHC Run 1 and 2 energies. These studies allow us to investigate the evolution of particle production with energy and system size and to compare models based on various particle production mechanisms and different initial conditions.",

            "text": "For the last 8 years from 2010 to 2018, the ALICE Collaboration has provided results of primarycharged-particle production in various collision energies and systems. In October 2017, LHC collided xenon ions at \u221a s NN = 5.44 TeV. Central collisions of heavy ions, like Pb (atomic number A = 208) revealed Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) effects. Xe has fewer nucleons (A = 129) than Pb and is a good medium-sized ion to check how the system size of a colliding system relates to the creation of the hot and dense medium. On the other hand, QGP-like effects have been observed even in pp and p-A collisions, the so-called small systems [1,2,3]. In high multiplicity pp and p-Pb collisions, the process of the Multi Parton Interactions (MPI) [4] becomes more important and is supposed to be related to QGP-like effect [5]. Particle production at few GeV/c is dominated by soft QCD and makes a big contribution to the charged-particle multiplicity density. This can be approached by phenomenological modelling.",

Data were collected with a minimum bias trigger requiring a coincidence of signals in each side of V0 sub-detectors (V0A and V0C) [9,8]. The primary interaction vertex of a collision is obtained by extending correlated hits in the two silicon-pixel layers of the SPD to the beam pipe of the LHC. Centrality estimation is based on a Glauber approach [10,11] by fitting to the V0 amplitude distribution [12] for the Pb-going side (V0A) in p-Pb collisions or for both A-going sides (V0A and V0C) in Pb-Pb and Xe-Xe collisions.
