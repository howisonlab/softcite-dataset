The production of heavy quark pairs, Q Q, can be calculated with perturbative QCD, while the hadronisation of Q Q pairs into heavy quarkonia is nonperturbative and must be determined using input from experimental results. Heavyquarkonium production therefore probes both perturbative and nonperturbative aspects of QCD by providing stringent tests of theoretical models. Knowledge of hadronic production of heavy quarkonium has been significantly improved in the past forty years [1,2], but the mechanism behind it is still not fully understood. Colour-singlet model calculations [3][4][5][6][7][8][9] require that the intermediate Q Q state is colourless and has the same J PC quantum numbers as those of the outgoing quarkonium state. In the nonrelativistic QCD (NRQCD) approach [10][11][12], intermediate Q Q states with all possible colour-spin-parity quantum numbers have nonzero probability to be transformed into the desired quarkonium. The transition probability of a Q Q pair into the quarkonium state is described by a long-distance matrix element (LDME), which is assumed to be universal and can be determined from experimental data.",

The first two contributions, which cannot be distinguished experimentally, are referred to as prompt production; while the third component can be separated from prompt production by exploiting the lifetime of b-hadrons. For prompt J/\u03c8 production the feed-down contribution is large, mostly from radiative decays of \u03c7 cJ (J = 0, 1, 2) mesons. This complicates the comparison between theoretical calculations and experimental results. On the contrary, the feed-down contribution to \u03c8(2S) mesons is negligible [13], thus theoretical calculations can be directly compared with measurements.",

            "text": "The differential cross-sections of inclusive \u03c8(2S) meson production in p p collisions at centre-of-mass energies of \u221a s = 1.8 and 1.96 TeV were measured by the CDF experiment at the Fermilab Tevatron Collider [16,17]  TeV [24] with LHC data. This paper presents measurements of \u03c8(2S) production cross-sections in pp collisions using a data sample collected by LHCb in 2015 (2011) corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 275 \u00b1 11 pb \u22121 at \u221a s = 13 TeV (614 \u00b1 11 pb \u22121 at \u221a s = 7 TeV). The \u03c8(2S) mesons from prompt production are abbreviated as \"prompt \u03c8(2S)\", while those from b-hadron decays are abbreviated as \"\u03c8(2S)-from-b\". The \u03c8(2S) mesons are reconstructed through their decay mode \u03c8(2S) \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 . The doubledifferential production cross-sections of prompt \u03c8(2S) and \u03c8(2S)-from-b as functions of transverse momentum p T and rapidity y and their integrated production cross-sections are measured, assuming zero polarisation of the \u03c8(2S) meson. The kinematic region of the measurement at 13 TeV (7 TeV) is 2 < p T < 20 GeV/c (3.5 < p T < 14 GeV/c) and 2.0 < y < 4.5. Compared to the previous LHCb measurement at 7 TeV using 2010 data [19], the new analysis at 7 TeV has several advantages: the 2011 data sample is much larger than that in the previous measurement corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36 pb \u22121 , the previous measurement did not provide the \u03c8(2S) production cross-section as a function of the rapidity y because of the limited sample size, and the same final state and offline selection criteria as those in the 13 TeV measurement are used in the new 7 TeV measurement. This guarantees that the maximum number of systematic uncertainties cancel in the cross-section ratio between 13 TeV and 7 TeV, which is measured in the present analysis. This represents a more stringent test of the theoretical models, since many of the experimental and theoretical uncertainties cancel. Finally, the \u03c8(2S) meson differential production cross-sections are compared with those of the J/\u03c8 meson at \u221a s = 13 TeV [25].",

The detector includes a high-precision tracking system consisting of a silicon-strip vertex detector surrounding the pp interaction region [28], a large-area silicon-strip detector located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4 Tm, and three stations of silicon-strip detectors and straw drift tubes [29,30] placed downstream of the magnet. The tracking system provides a measurement of the momentum, p, of charged particles with a relative uncertainty that varies from 0.5% at low momentum to 1.0% at 200 GeV/c. The minimum distance of a track to a primary vertex (PV), the impact parameter (IP), is measured with a resolution of (15+29/ p T ) \u00b5m, where p T is in GeV/c. Different types of charged hadrons are distinguished using information from two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors [31]. Photons, electrons and hadrons are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad (SPD) and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter and a hadronic calorimeter. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers [32]. The online event selection is performed by a trigger [33], which consists of a hardware stage, based on information from the calorimeter and muon systems, followed by a software stage, which applies a full event reconstruction. Simulated samples are used to evaluate the \u03c8(2S) detection efficiency. In the simulation, pp collisions are generated using Pythia 8 [34,35] with a specific LHCb configuration [36]. Decays of unstable particles are described by EvtGen [37], in which final-state radiation is generated using Photos [38]. Both the leading-order colour-singlet and colour-octet contributions are included in the generated prompt charmonium states [36,39]. These states are generated with zero polarisation. The interaction of the generated particles with the detector, and its response, are implemented using the Geant4 toolkit [40,41] as described in Ref. [42].",

The correlation between m \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 and t z is found to be negligible. The invariant-mass distribution of the signal candidates in each bin is described by the sum of two Crystal Ball (CB) functions [47] with a common mean value and different widths. The parameters of the power-law tails, the relative fractions and the difference between the widths of the two CB functions are fixed to values obtained from simulation, leaving the mean value and the width of one of the CB functions as free parameters. The invariant-mass distribution of the combinatorial background is described by an exponential function with the slope parameter free to vary in the fit. The t z distribution of prompt \u03c8(2S) mesons is described by a Dirac \u03b4 function at t z = 0, and that of \u03c8(2S)-fromb by an exponential function, both convolved with the sum of two Gaussian functions. A \u03c8(2S) candidate can also be associated to a wrong PV, resulting in a long tail component in the t z distribution. This shape is modelled from data by calculating t z between the \u03c8(2S) candidate from a given event and the closest PV in the next event of the sample.

It is parametrised as the combination of a Dirac \u03b4 function and the sum of five exponential functions, three for positive t z and two for negative t z .

The double-differential cross-sections, as functions of p T and y of the \u03c8(2S) meson in the range of 2 < p T < 20 GeV/c and 2.0 < y < 4.5, are determined for prompt \u03c8(2S) mesons and \u03c8(2S) mesons from b-hadron decays. A new measurement of the branching fraction B(b \u2192 \u03c8(2S)X ) is presented, which is in agreement with the world average[13]. The measured prompt \u03c8(2S) production cross-section as a function of transverse momentum is in good agreement in the high p T region with theoretical calculations in the NRQCD framework. Theoretical predictions based on the FONLL calculations describe well the measured cross-sections for \u03c8(2S) mesons from b-hadron decays.",
