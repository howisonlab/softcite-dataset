No excess of signal events over the expected background has been observed, and we set upper limits on the branching fractions in the range (5.9 \u2212 18) \u00d7 10 \u22128 at the 90% confidence level. These upper limits include the first results for the \u2113\u03c9 mode as well as new limits that are significantly more restrictive than our previous results for the \u2113\u03c6, \u2113K * 0 , \u2113K * 0 and \u2113\u03c1 0 modes.",

However, LFV is expected to appear in many extensions of the SM. Some such models predict branching fractions for \u03c4 LFV decays in the range 10 \u22128 \u2212 10 \u22127 [1,2,3], which can be reached at the present B-factories. An observation of LFV would provide unambiguous evidence for new physics beyond the SM.",

No evidence for a signal is observed, and the upper limits on the branching fractions are set in the range (5.9 \u2212 18) \u00d7 10 \u22128 at the 90% CL. This analysis is the first search for the \u03c4 \u2212 \u2192 \u2113 \u2212 \u03c9 mode. The results for the \u03c4 \u2212 \u2192 \u2113 \u2212 \u03c6, \u2113 \u2212 K * 0 , \u2113 \u2212K * 0 and \u2113 \u2212 \u03c1 0 modes are 3 \u2212 10 times more restrictive than our previous results obtained using 158 fb \u22121 of data. The sensitivity improvement comes from a factor of 3.4-times larger statistics and an optimized analysis. In particular, we have improved the conditions on p miss and m 2 miss to reduce \u03c4 \u03c4 and qq background as well as those on the opening angle \u03b1 to reduce two-photon background. As a result, better background suppression is achieved and the efficiency is improved, e.g. it increases by a factor of 2.8 for the \u00b5 \u2212 \u03c6 and 2.5 for the e \u2212 \u03c6 mode.
