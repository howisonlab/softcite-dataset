In the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) [10][11][12][13][14], charginos,\u03c7 \u00b1 1,2 , and neutralinos,\u03c7 0 1,2,3,4 , are the mass-ordered eigenstates formed from the linear superposition of the SUSY partners of the Higgs and electroweak gauge bosons (higgsinos, winos and bino). In R-parity-conserving models, SUSY particles are pair-produced in colliders and the lightest SUSY particle (LSP) is stable. In many models the LSP is assumed to be a bino-like\u03c7 0 1 , which is weakly interacting. Naturalness arguments [15,16] suggest that the lightest of the charginos and neutralinos may have masses at the electroweak scale, and may be accessible at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) [17]. Furthermore, direct pair production of charginos and neutralinos may be the dominant production of supersymmetric e-mail: atlas.publications@cern.ch particles if the superpartners of the gluon and quarks are heavier than a few TeV.",

This paper focuses on SUSY scenarios where the decay to the Higgs boson is the dominant one. This happens when the mass splitting between the two lightest neutralinos is larger than the Higgs boson mass and the higgsinos are much heavier than the winos, causing the composition of the lightest chargino and next-to-lightest neutralino to be wino-like and nearly mass degenerate.",

The Higgs boson decays into a pair of bquarks, or a pair of photons, or a pair of W bosons where at least one of the bosons decays leptonically. The final states therefore contain missing transverse momentum from neutrinos and neutralinos, one lepton ( = e or \u03bc), and one of the following: two b-quarks ( bb), or two photons ( \u03b3 \u03b3 ), or an additional lepton with the same electric charge ( \u00b1 \u00b1 ). The Higgs boson candidate can be fully reconstructed with the bb and \u03b3 \u03b3 signatures. The \u00b1 \u00b1 signature does not allow for such reconstruction and it is considered because of its small SM background. Its main signal contribution is due to h \u2192 W W , with smaller contributions from h \u2192 Z Z and h \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 when some of the visible decay products are missed during the event reconstruction.",

The x-axis points from the IP to the centre of the ductor microstrip tracker, and a transition radiation tracker. The ID is surrounded by a thin superconducting solenoid providing a 2 T axial magnetic field. A high-granularity lead/liquid-argon (LAr) sampling calorimeter measures the energy and the position of electromagnetic showers within |\u03b7| < 3.2. Sampling calorimeters with LAr are also used to measure hadronic showers in the endcap (1.5 < |\u03b7| < 3.2) and forward (3.1 < |\u03b7| < 4.9) regions, while a steel/scintillator tile calorimeter measures hadronic showers in the central region (|\u03b7| < 1.7). The muon spectrometer (MS) surrounds the calorimeters and consists of three large superconducting air-core toroid magnets, each with eight coils, precision tracking chambers (|\u03b7| < 2.7), and fast trigger chambers (|\u03b7| < 2.4).

To reduce statistical uncertainties originating from the limited number of simulated events, the non-Higgs contributions are obtained in the sideband and scaled into the Higgs-mass window by 0.2. The simulation-based prediction of the non-Higgs background is estimated from the W/Z(\u03b3, \u03b3 \u03b3 ) + jets samples, after applying a data-driven correction for the probability of electrons or jets to be reconstructed as photons. The contribution from backgrounds with jets reconstructed as leptons is determined by using the \"fake factor\" method described in Ref. [82].

The approach followed is similar to the one in Ref. [81]: the non-Higgs background is modelled as exp(\u2212\u03b1m \u03b3 \u03b3 ), with the constant \u03b1 as a free, positive parameter in the fit. Alternative functional models are used to evaluate the systematic uncertainty due to the choice of background modelling function. The h \u2192 \u03b3 \u03b3 template, used for the Higgs background and signal, is formed by the sum of a Crystal Ball function [83] for the core of the distribution and a Gaussian function for the tails. This functional form follows the one used in the SM h \u2192 \u03b3 \u03b3 analysis [81], with the nominal values and uncertainties on the fit parameters determined by fits to the simulation in SR \u03b3 \u03b3 -1 and SR \u03b3 \u03b3 -2. The results of the fit to the simulation are used as an external constraint on the template during the fit to data. The width of the Gaussian core of the Crystal Ball function quantifies the detector resolution and is determined in simulation to be 1.7 GeV in SR \u03b3 \u03b3 -1 and 1.8 GeV in SR \u03b3 \u03b3 -2.

Statistical uncertainties from the data in the CRs result in uncertainties on the normalisations of the tt and W + jets backgrounds, while the limited number of simulated events yields uncertainty on the shape of the background m bb distributions. The largest experimental systematic uncertainties are those on the jet energy scale [72] and resolution [89], derived from a combination of test-beam data and in-situ measurements, followed by the uncertainty on the b-jet identification efficiency [90]. The uncertainty on the W boson background modelling is dominated by the uncertainty on the cross section for the production of the W boson in association with heavy-flavour jets, and is reported within the \"Other sources\". The W boson background component is small in bb SRs, and its uncertainty is constrained by the CRs with a similar composition.",

The systematic uncertainties on the Higgs background estimates are dominated by the theoretical uncertainties on the W h, Zh, and tth production cross sections and the photon reconstruction. The main theoretical uncertainties are those on the QCD scales and the parton distribution functions [55].
