An untagged time-integrated analysis was presented finding a branching fraction of B = (1.28 +0.35 \u22120.30 \u00b1 0.11) \u00d7 10 \u22126 and a longitudinal polarisation fraction of f L = 0.80 +0.11 \u22120.12 \u00b1 0.06. In untagged time-integrated analyses the distributions for B 0 and B 0 decays are assumed to be identical and summed, so that they can be fitted with a single amplitude. However, if CP -violation effects are present, the distribution is given by the incoherent sum of the two contributions. The Belle collaboration also searched for this decay [2] and a branching fraction of B = (0.26 +0.33+0. 10 \u22120.29\u22120.07 ) \u00d7 10 \u22126 was measured, disregarding S-wave contributions. There is a 2.2 standard-deviations difference between the branching fraction measured by the two experiments. The predictions JHEP07(2019)032 3 ) \u00d7 10 \u22126 and f L = 0.69 +0.01+0.34 \u22120.01\u22120.27 [3]. Perturbative QCD predicts B = (0.64 +0.24 \u22120.23 ) \u00d7 10 \u22126 [4]. 2 These theoretical predictions agree with the experimental results within the large uncertainties. The measurement of f L agrees with the na\u00efve hypothesis, based on the quark helicity conservation and the V \u2212A nature of the weak interaction, that charmless decays into pairs of vector mesons (V V ) should be strongly longitudinally polarised. See, for example, the Polarization in B Decays review in ref. [5].",

More recently, a complete CP -sensitive time-dependent analysis of B 0 s \u2192 (K + \u03c0 \u2212 )(K \u2212 \u03c0 + ) decays in the (K\u03c0) mass range from 750 to 1600 MeV/c 2 has been published by LHCb [7], with data corresponding to 3 fb \u22121 of integrated luminosity. A determination of f L = 0.208 \u00b1 0.032 \u00b1 0.046 was performed as well as the first measurements of the mixing-induced CP -violating phase \u03c6 dd s and of the direct CP asymmetry parameter |\u03bb|. These LHCb analyses of B 0 s \u2192 (K + \u03c0 \u2212 )(K \u2212 \u03c0 + ) decays lead to three conclusions: firstly, within their uncertainties, the measured observables are compatible with the absence of CP violation; secondly, a low polarisation fraction is found; finally, a large S-wave contribution, as much as 60%, is measured in the 150 MeV/c 2 window around the K * 0 mass. The low longitudinal polarisation fraction shows a tension with the prediction of QCDF (f L = 0.63 +0.42 \u22120.29 [3]) and disfavours the hypothesis of strongly longitudinally polarised V V decays. Theoretical studies try to explain the small longitudinal polarisation with mechanisms such as contributions from annihilation processes [3,8]. It is intriguing that the two channels B 0 \u2192 K * 0 K * 0 and B 0 s \u2192 K * 0 K * 0 , which are related by U-spin symmetry, implying the exchange of d and s quarks as displayed in figure 1, show such different polarisations. A comprehensive theory review on polarisation of charmless V V neutral B-meson decays can be found in ref. [9].",

The study of the angular distribution employs the helicity angles shown in figure 2: \u03b8 1(2) , defined as the angle between the direction of the K +(\u2212) meson and the direction opposite to the B-meson momentum in the rest frame of the K * 0 (K * 0 ) resonance, and \u03c6, the angle between the decay planes of the two vector mesons in the B-meson rest frame. From angular momentum conservation, three relative polarisations of the final state are possible for V V final states that correspond to longitudinal (0 or L), or transverse to the direction of motion and parallel ( ) or perpendicular (\u22a5) to each other. For the two-body invariant mass of the (K + \u03c0 \u2212 ) and (K \u2212 \u03c0 + ) pairs, noted as m 1 \u2261 M (K + \u03c0 \u2212 ) and m 2 \u2261 M (K \u2212 \u03c0 + ), a range of 150 MeV/c 2 around the known K * 0 mass [5] is considered. Therefore, (K\u03c0) pairs may not only originate from the spin-1 K * 0 meson, but also from other spin states. This justifies that, besides the helicity angles, a phenomenological description of the two-body invariant mass spectra, employing the isobar model, is adopted in the analytic model. In the isobar approach, the decay amplitude is modelled as a linear superposition of quasi-two-body amplitudes [14][15][16].",
