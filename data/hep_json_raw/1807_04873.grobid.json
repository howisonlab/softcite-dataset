The data set used corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb \u22121 of proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV recorded by the ATLAS detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. No significant excess relative to the Standard Model expectation is observed. The observed limit on the non-resonant Higgs boson pair cross-section is 0.73 pb at 95% confidence level. This observed limit is equivalent to 22 times the predicted Standard Model cross-section. The Higgs boson self-coupling (\u03ba \u03bb = \u03bb HHH /\u03bb SM HHH ) is constrained at 95% confidence level to \u22128.2 < \u03ba \u03bb < 13.2. For resonant Higgs boson pair production through X \u2192 HH \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3bb, the limit is presented, using the narrow-width approximation, as a function of m X in the range 260 GeV < m X < 1000 GeV. The observed limits range from 1.1 pb to 0.12 pb over this mass range.",

If SM expectations hold, the production of a Higgs boson pair in a single pp interaction should not be observable with the currently available LHC data set. In  Figure 1. Leading-order production modes for Higgs boson pairs. In the SM, there is destructive interference between (a) the heavy-quark loop and (b) the Higgs self-coupling production modes, which reduces the overall cross-section. BSM Higgs boson pair production could proceed through changes to the Higgs couplings, for example the ttH or HHH couplings which contribute to (a) and (b), or through an intermediate resonance, X, which could, for example, be produced through a quark loop as shown in (c).",

Models with two Higgs doublets [5], such as the minimal supersymmetric extension of the SM [6], twin Higgs models [7] and composite Higgs models [8,9], add a second complex scalar doublet to the Higgs sector. In general, the neutral Higgs fields from the two doublets will mix, which may result in the existence of a heavy Higgs boson that decays into two of its lighter Higgs boson partners.

These can either originate from loop corrections involving new particles, such as light, coloured scalars [11], or through non-SM couplings. Changes to the single Higgs boson production cross-section arising from such loopcorrections are neglected in this paper. Anomalous couplings can either be extensions to the SM, such as contact interactions between two top quarks and two Higgs bosons [12], or be deviations from the SM values of the couplings between the Higgs boson and other particles. In this work, the effective Higgs self-coupling, \u03bb HHH , is parameterised by a scale factor \u03ba \u03bb (\u03ba \u03bb = \u03bb HHH /\u03bb SM HHH ) where the SM superscript refers to the SM value of this parameter. The theoretical and phenomenological implications of such couplings for complete models are discussed in refs. [13,14]. The Yukawa coupling between the top quark and the Higgs boson is set to its SM value in this paper, consistent with its recent direct observation [15,16]. This paper describes a search for the production of pairs of Higgs bosons in pp collisions at the LHC. The search is carried out in the \u03b3\u03b3bb final state, and considers both resonant and non-resonant contributions. Previous searches were carried out by the ATLAS and -2 -",

It consists of an inner tracking detector (ID) surrounded by a thin superconducting solenoid providing a 2 T axial magnetic field, electromagnetic (EM) and hadronic calorimeters, and a muon spectrometer (MS). The inner tracking detector, consisting of silicon pixel, sili-JHEP11(2018)040 con microstrip, and transition radiation tracking systems, covers the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 2.5. The innermost pixel layer, the insertable B-layer (IBL) [25], was added between the first and second runs of the LHC, around a new, narrower and thinner beam pipe. The IBL improves the experiment's ability to identify displaced vertices and thereby improves the performance of the b-tagging algorithms [26]. Lead/liquid-argon (LAr) sampling calorimeters with high granularity provide energy measurements of EM showers. A hadronic steel/scintillator-tile calorimeter covers the central pseudorapidity range (|\u03b7| < 1.7), while a LAr hadronic endcap calorimeter provides coverage over 1.5 < |\u03b7| < 3.2. The endcap and forward regions are instrumented with LAr calorimeters for both the EM and hadronic energy measurements up to |\u03b7| = 4.9. The MS surrounds the calorimeters and is based on three large air-core toroidal superconducting magnets, each with eight coils, and with bending power in the range of 2.0 to 7.5 T m.

The reconstruction algorithm searches for possible matches between energy clusters and tracks reconstructed in the inner detector and extrapolated to the calorimeter. Well-reconstructed tracks matched to clusters are classified as electron candidates, while clusters without matching tracks are classified as unconverted photon candidates. Clusters matched to a reconstructed conversion vertex or to pairs of tracks consistent with the hypothesis of a \u03b3 \u2192 e + e \u2212 conversion process are classified as converted photon candidates. Photon energies are determined by summing the energies of all cells belonging to the associated cluster. Simulation-based corrections are then applied to account for energy losses and leakage outside the cluster [63]. The absolute energy scale and response resolution is calibrated using Z \u2192 e + e \u2212 events from data. For the photons considered in this analysis, the reconstruction efficiency for both the converted and unconverted photons is 97%. Photon identification is based on the lateral and longitudinal energy profiles of EM showers measured in the calorimeter [64]. The reconstructed photon candidates must satisfy tight photon identifi-JHEP11(2018)040 cation criteria. These exploit the fine granularity of the first layer of the EM calorimeter in order to reject background photons from hadron decays. The photon identification efficiency varies as a function of E T and |\u03b7| and is typically 85-90% (85-95%) for unconverted (converted) photons in the range of 30 GeV < E T < 100 GeV.",

The potential bias arising from this procedure, termed 'spurious signal', is estimated by performing signal-plus-background fits to the JHEP11(2018)040 combined continuum background from simulation, including the \u03b3\u03b3, \u03b3j, j\u03b3 and jj components [35]. The maximum absolute value of the extracted signal, for a signal in the range 121 GeV < m \u03b3\u03b3 < 129 GeV, is taken as the bias. This method is used to discriminate between different potential fit functions -the function chosen is the one with the smallest spurious signal bias. If multiple functions have the same bias, the one with the smallest number of parameters is chosen. The first-order exponential function has the smallest bias among the seven functions considered and is therefore chosen. The background from single Higgs boson production is described using a double-sided Crystal Ball function, with its parameters determined through fits to the appropriate simulated samples.",

For the loose (tight) mass selection, the Novosibirsk function 2 (exponential function) has the smallest bias among the three (four) functions considered and is therefore chosen. As a result, for low-mass resonances both the signal and background fit functions have a characteristic peaked shape. This degeneracy could potentially introduce a bias in the extracted signal cross-section. In order to stabilise the background fit, nominal values of the shape parameters are estimated by fitting to the simulated events described in section 5.1. The shape is then allowed to vary in the likelihood to within the statistical covariance of this template fit. Experimental systematics on the background shape have a small effect and are neglected. The normalisation of the background is estimated by interpolating the m \u03b3\u03b3 sideband data. Additionally, a simple bias test is performed by drawing pseudo-data sets from the overall probability distribution created by combining the Novosibirsk background function with the signal function. For each mass point and each value of the injected signal cross-section, fits are performed on the ensemble of pseudo-data sets and the median extracted signal cross-section is recorded. For resonances with masses below 400 GeV, a small correction is applied to remove the observed bias. The correction is less 2 P (x) = e \u22120.5 (ln qy ) 2 /\u039b 2 +\u039b 2",

No significant deviations from the Standard Model predictions are observed. A 95% CL upper limit of 0.73 pb is set on the cross-section for non-resonant production, while the expected limit is 0.93 pb. This observed (expected) limit is 22 (28) times the predicted SM cross-section. The Higgs boson self-coupling is constrained at 95% CL to \u22128.2 < \u03ba \u03bb < 13.2 whereas the expected limits are \u22128.3 < \u03ba \u03bb < 13.2.
