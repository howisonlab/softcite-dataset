The analysis uses 760 \u03bcb \u22121 of minimum bias data collected by the ATLAS detector at the LHC in the year 2010. The measured transverse polarization averaged over Feynman x F from 5 \u00d7 10 \u22125 to 0.01 and transverse momentum p T from 0.8 to 15 GeV is \u22120.010 AE 0.005\u00f0stat\u00de AE 0.004\u00f0syst\u00de for \u039b and 0.002 AE 0.006\u00f0stat\u00de AE 0.004\u00f0syst\u00de for\u039b. It is also measured as a function of x F and p T , but no significant dependence on these variables is observed. Prior to this measurement, the polarization was measured at fixed-target experiments with center-of-mass energies up to about 40 GeV. The ATLAS results are compatible with the extrapolation of a fit from previous measurements to the x F range covered by this measurement.",

The \u039b hyperons are spin-1=2 particles and their polarization is characterized by a polarization vectorP. Its component, P, transverse to the \u039b momentum is of interest since for hyperons produced via the strong interaction parity conservation requires that the parallel component is zero. Following the definition used by previous protonproton and proton-nucleon fixed-target experiments [1][2][3][4][5] and an experiment at the CERN Intersecting Storage Rings (ISR) [6], the polarization is measured in the direction normal to the production plane of the \u039b hyperon:",

Assuming CP conservation, the value of \u03b1 for the\u039b decay is of the same magnitude as for the \u039b with an opposite sign. Large polarization of \u039b hyperons (up to 30%) was observed in inclusive proton-proton and proton-nucleon collisions by previous experiments [1][2][3][4][5][6]. These results are inconsistent with perturbative QCD (pQCD) calculations [9] that predict much smaller polarization values. On the other hand, the\u039b polarization was measured to be consistent with zero by all previous experiments [1][2][3][4][5][6]. Many models [10] have been proposed to explain the origin of hyperon polarization; however, while some models have been successful in explaining the behavior of one member of the hyperon family, no model has been successful in explaining the behavior of all.",

This measurement makes use of the innermost subsystem called the inner detector (ID). The ID, which serves as a tracking detector, is situated in a magnetic field of about 2 T generated by a superconducting solenoid. Charged-particle tracks are reconstructed with p T > 50 MeV and in the pseudorapidity range of j\u03b7j < 2.5. The ID consists of two types of silicon detectors (pixel and microstrip) and a gasfilled detector with a transition radiation detection capability, called the transition radiation tracker (TRT). The ID forms a cylinder 7 m long with a diameter of 2.3 m. Pixel detectors form three cylindrical layers surrounding the IP and three disks on each side of the detector. Microstrip detectors are arranged in four cylindrical layers (with each module consisting of two silicon wafers) and nine disks in each of the forward regions. The silicon detectors extend to a distance of 50 cm from the beam axis. The TRT consists of multiple layers of gas-filled straw tubes oriented parallel to the beam in the central region and perpendicularly in the forward regions. Typically, three pixel layers and eight microstrip layers (providing four space points) are crossed by each track originating at the collision point. A large number of tracking points (typically 36 per track) are provided by the TRT.",

Relative differences between the number of tracks in bins of the data and MC distributions are then attributed to the tracking efficiency uncertainty and propagated to the final result using event weighting. (7) Equation (5) assumes that the total efficiency of \u039b reconstruction does not depend on polarization. This is satisfied if the efficiency \u03b5\u00f0t\u00de is an even function of t. It was checked that this assumption has a negligible effect on the result. (8) The uncertainty of the \u03b1 parameter measured previously [7,8] is propagated to the uncertainty of the measured polarization. 9The measurement is performed in the phase space defined by the p T , \u03b7, and x F ranges. With the data, these can only be defined in terms of measured quantities that are affected by the finite detector resolution. The fraction of events that migrate into and out of the fiducial volume due to resolution is estimated using simulation and the impact of event migration on the polarization is estimated. (10) The small fraction (< 3%) of \u039b hyperons that are produced from weak decays can be polarized in the direction parallel to their momenta, whereas this measurement is performed assuming the parallel component of the polarization vector is zero. Using the simulation, it is estimated that weakly produced \u039b hyperons cannot significantly affect the final result. Similarly, the contribution of \u039b hyperons from secondary hadronic interactions with the detector material (< 3%), which have zero transverse polarization in the chosen reference frame, can be neglected. 11Lastly, the MC simulation is used to show that the trigger selection does not bias the polarization measurement.",

To allow comparisons between the measured values and any theoretical parametrization of P\u00f0x F ; p T \u00de, the efficiency maps of reconstructed \u039b and\u039b decays are provided in the HEPDATA database [19]. Figure 7 shows the reconstruction efficiency for \u039b. The MC simulation is used to check that the reconstruction efficiency as a function of p T and x F does not depend on the value of the polarization. These maps can therefore be used to calculate the expected average polarization given by Eq. 7for any theoretical model. Figure 8 compares this result with other measurements: an experiment at the M2 beam line at Fermilab [2], experiment E799 [3] also at Fermilab, NA48 [4] at   Fig. 8 the ATLAS data cover the average p T range of 1.83-2.12 GeV. Furthermore, the HERA-B measurement covers negative values of x F . In Fig. 8, the HERA-B results are transformed using Eq. (1) so that they can be compared with other results. The E799 and NA48 experiments define x F as the fraction of the beam energy carried by the \u039b. In Fig. 8, the values are transformed according to the definition of x F used in this paper (although the difference is very small). Figure 8 shows only a subset of the M2 results measured at a fixed production angle of about 6 mrad with a beryllium target. A parametrization of the polarization [2] as a function of x F and p T is used to extrapolate the results of the M2 experiment to the x F and p T range of this measurement. The extrapolated value is less than 5 \u00d7 10 \u22124 , which can effectively be treated as zero given the precision of this measurement. The fixed-target experiments [1][2][3][4][5] did not observe any strong dependence of the \u039b polarization on the collision energy. Some energy dependence could be introduced at the LHC, since due to a significant collision energy increase, the fraction of \u039b hyperons from decays of heavier baryons may be different than for low energy collisions. Using PYTHIA, it is estimated that about 50% of the \u039b hyperons in ATLAS data are produced in decays, which is comparable to the estimate of about 40% for NA48 [4]. Therefore, assuming that the polarization of the original baryons is diluted in the decay, the magnitude of the polarization at the LHC is expected to be slightly smaller than that observed by the previous experiments at the same p T and x F . In the absence of any new polarizationproducing mechanism that would manifest itself at low x F and high center-of-mass energies, the measured polarization is expected to be consistent with zero; this is so for the results presented here.",
