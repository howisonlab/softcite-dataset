The \u03d2(10860) resonance, also known as \u03d2(5S), is above mass threshold for the B s and shares many of the same advantages. The Belle experiment has collected more than 120 fb \u22121 at the \u03d2(5S), corresponding to 7.9 million B s events. First results from these data are presented, including the first observation of a baryonic decay of B s , a novel measurement of sin 2\u03c6 1 , and observation of h b (1P), h b (2P), and two charged bottomonium-like states.",

The Belle experiment [2], located at KEKB [3], although built primarily to measure CP asymmetries of B meson decay in e + e \u2212 annihilations at the \u03d2(4S) resonance, collected in 2005-9 a total of 121.4 fb \u22121 at the \u03d2(5S) resonance, corresponding to 37 million resonance events and including 7.9 million B s events. Part of this sample, 23.6 fb \u22121 , as well as an 8 fb \u22121 nearby energy scan produced 11 publications covering several B s modes, B events at the \u03d2(5S), and bottomonium transitions and spectroscopy. While rates of B s in e + e \u2212 collisions are low compared to those for hadronic collisions, \u03c3 (e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03d2(5S))\u2248 0.3 nb, the \u03d2(5S) is nonetheless competitive for several aspects of B s decay; the e + e \u2212 environment produces clean events, efficiently triggered, with precisely known center-of-mass energy. Furthermore, the B-factory offers an existing facility with high luminosity, a well-studied detector with precise and sensitive photon detection, and an abundance of \u03d2(4S) data for comparisons. The new preliminary results presented here, based on the full on-resonance set, includeB 0 s \u2192 \u039b + c \u03c0 \u2212\u039b , a novel measurement of sin 2\u03c6 1 (aka sin 2\u03b2 ), and several new bottomonia.",

Figure 1 shows the distributions in M miss for (center) B 0 \u03c0 + and (right) B 0 \u03c0 \u2212 combinations, respectively, where the fits yield a total of 21.5 \u00b1 6.8 events.

This result establishes a new time-independent method of measuring sin 2\u03c6 1 , and the value is consistent with measurements in \u03d2(4S) data. The spectroscopy of bottomonia above BB threshold is not well known, and the data at and near the \u03d2(5S) collected by Belle provide an excellent opportunity for exploration. In addition to the fact that the predicted states h b (1P,2P)(J PC = 1 +\u2212 ) and \u03b7 b (1S,2S,3S)(J PC = 0 \u2212+ ) are yet to be established, this activity is motivated by several recent findings: the observation in the charm sector of many previously unpredicted charmonium-like states (X,Y, Z) by Babar, Belle, and CLEO; enhanced h c production in events e + e \u2212 \u2192 h c \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 in CLEO data at the mass of the charmonium-like state Y (4260) [5]; searches for h b at Babar (3.0\u03c3 evidence [6]) and CLEO (upper limit [7]) in \u03d2(3S) \u2192 h b \u03c0 0 ; measurement at Belle of an anomalously high rate of e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03d2(nS)\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 at \u03d2(5S) energy, roughly two orders of magnitude greater than at other \u03d2's [8]; cross section for e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03d2(nS)\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 at CMS energies near the \u03d2(5S) found to peak \u223c20 MeV higher than the peak of the hadronic cross section [9]. In this talk I discuss the first observation of h b (1S) and h b (2S) [10] as well as the first observation of a charged bottomonium-like state [11] that may be analogous to the Z(4430), a charmonium-like state seen at Belle [12].",

As there are no clear and efficient exclusive decays expected of h b , this search is conducted by taking pairs of oppositely charged pions and observing the distribution in missing mass. The raw sample of candidates is huge but, given the high statistics, it is possible to fit to peaks with smooth polynomial background functions to identify several new states. The raw and background-subtracted distributions are shown in Figure 2. The fit yields a mass of 9898.25 \u00b1 1.06 +1.03 \u22121.07 MeV/c 2 (10259.76 \u00b1 0.64 +1.43 \u22121.03 MeV/c 2 ) for h b (1P) (h b (2P)), with significance 5.5\u03c3 (11.2\u03c3 ) including systematics. This constitutes the first observation of these two states. In the absence of hyperfine interactions, the mass of h b (nP) is equal to the spin-weighted average of the corresponding \u03c7 b (nP) states, M 0 (h b (nP)) \u2261 [M(\u03c7 b0 (nP)) + 3M(\u03c7 b1 (nP)) + 5M(\u03c7 b2 (nP))]/9, and for heavy quarkonia the difference \u2206M n = M meas (h b (nP)) \u2212 M 0 (h b (nP)) is expected to be small. We find \u2206M 1 = 1.62 \u00b1 1.52MeV/c 2 and \u2206M 2 = 0.48 +1.57 \u22121.22 MeV/c 2 , both consistent with zero. The ratio of the corresponding h b and \u03d2 rates, R n \u2261 \u0393(\u03d2(5S)\u2192h b (nS)\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) \u0393(\u03d2(5S)\u2192\u03d2(2S)\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) , is na\u00efvely expected to be small, as the transition to h b requires a heavy quark to flip spin, whereas that to \u03d2 does not. The observed ratios, R 1 = 0.407 \u00b1 0.079 +0.048 \u22120.076 and R 2 = 0.78 \u00b1 0.09 +0.22 \u22120.10 , possibly indicate a more complicated picture. Motivated by this and other anomalies listed above, we have studied the resonant substructure of the \u03d2(5S)\u2192 h b (nP)\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and \u03d2(5S)\u2192 \u03d2(nP)\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 transitions. For \u03d2(5S)\u2192 h b (nP)\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 we select h b (nP) candidates as above and for each of the two pions construct a h b (nP)\u03c0 mass via missing mass of the remaining pion, MM(\u03c0). The h b fit is repeated in bins of MM(\u03c0), and the resulting yields are plotted as shown in Figure 3. Evident in both plots is a double peak structure, which is fitted to a sum of two S-wave Breit-Wigner forms plus a nonresonant background: ",

The measured masses and widths for all five channels are in good agreement, and the overall averages are included in the table. It is noted that the relative phases of the h b (\u03d2) channels are consistent with 180 \u2022 (0 \u2022 ) and that the two masses are just above threshold for B * sBs and B * sB * s , respectively, characteristics predicted for \"meson molecule\" models [14]. This constitutes the first observation of two charged bottomonium-like states, which we shall call Z b (10610) and Z b (10650). In summary the Belle experiment, which was designed to measure CP-asymmetry in B decay, is exploring the \u03d2(5S) region and reports first results based on 121.4 fb \u22121 of data collected on the \u03d2(5S) resonance. We have made the first observation of a baryonic B s decay, in the mode B s \u2192 \u039b + c \u03c0 \u2212\u039b . Using full reconstruction, we identify \u03d2(5S)\u2192 B ( * )0 B ( * )\u2212 \u03c0 + events to tag B 0 flavor and make a time-independent measurement of sin 2\u03c6 1 . We have also made the first observation of the h b (1P) and h b (2P) as well as two new charged bottomonium-like states, Z + b (10610) and Z + b (10650), which are each observed in five different channels.",
