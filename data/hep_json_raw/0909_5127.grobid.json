            "text": "Evidences of neutrino oscillation have been observed by several experiments over the last decade, and neutrino oscillation physics has entered the era of precision measurements. In the second generation accelerator neutrino oscillation experiments, precise knowledge of neutrino cross-sections with nuclei are important to achieve the best sensitivity. However, the typical accuracy of neutrino-nucleus cross-sections in the one GeV region, which is relevant to many future experiments, is 20% with our current knowledge. Among several neutrino interaction channels, neutrino interactions producing single pion form significant backgrounds for neutrino oscillation studies with a few-GeV neutrino beam, and thus understanding those processes is essential. It has been known for years that neutrinos can produce pions by interacting coherently with the nucleons forming the target nucleus. are possible, \u03bd \u03bc A \u2192 \u03bc \u2212 A\u03c0 + and \u03bd \u03bc A \u2192 \u03bd \u03bc A\u03c0 0 , where A is a nucleus. The outgoing lepton and pion tend to go in the forward direction in the lab frame, and no nuclear breakup occurs. Recent results on coherent pion production have induced interest of the neutrino physics community. The non-existence of charged current coherent pion production in a 1.3 GeV wide-band neutrino beam has been reported by K2K [1], while there exist charged current coherent pion production positive results at higher neutrino energies. On the one hand, evidence for NC coherent pion production in the similar neutrino energy has been recently reported by MiniBooNE [2].",

In this paper, we report the first measurement of charged current coherent pion production on carbon by neutrinos in the SciBooNE experiment, which was recently published in ref. [4]. Figure 1 shows a schematic drawing of the experimental setup of SciBooNE. The experiment uses the Booster Neutrino Beam (BNB) at Fermilab. The primary proton beam, with kinetic energy 8 GeV, is extracted to strike a 71 cm long, 1 cm diameter beryllium target. Each beam spill consists of 81 bunches of protons, containing typically 4 \u00d7 10 12 protons in a total spill duration of 1.6 \u03bcs. The target sits at the upstream end of a magnetic focusing horn that is pulsed with approximately 170 kA to focus the mesons, primarily \u03c0 + , produced by the p-Be interactions. In a 50 m long decay pipe following the horn, \u03c0 + decay and produce neutrinos, before the mesons encounter an absorber. The flux is dominated by muon neutrinos (93% of total), with small contributions from muon antineutrinos (6.4%), and electron neutrinos and antineutrinos (0.6% in total). The flux-averaged mean neutrino energy is 0.7 GeV. When the horn polarity is reversed, \u03c0 \u2212 are focused and hence a predominantly antineutrino beam is created.",

The most energetic SciBar-MRD matched track in any event is considered as the muon candidate. The matching criteria impose a muon momentum threshold of 350 MeV/c. The neutrino interaction vertex is reconstructed as the upstream edge of the muon candidate.

Finally, event timing is required to be within 2 \u03bcs beam timing window. The cosmic-ray background contamination in the beam timing window is only 0.5%, estimated using a beam-off timing window. Approximately 30000 events are selected as our standard charged current sample, which is called SciBar-MRD matched sample. According to the MC simulation, the selection efficiency and purity of true \u03bd \u03bc charged current events are 27.9% and 92.8%, respectively. Two subsamples of the SciBar-MRD matched sample are further defined: the MRD stopped sample and the MRD penetrated sample. Events with the muon stopping in the MRD are classified as MRD stopped events. Events with the muon exiting from the downstream end of the MRD are defined as the MRD penetrated sample, in which we can measure only a part of the muon momentum. The average neutrino beam energy for true charged current events in the MRD stopped and MRD penetrated samples is 1.0 GeV and 2.0 GeV, respectively, enabling a measurement of charged current coherent pion production at two different mean neutrino energies.",

The probability of misidentification is estimated to be 1.1% for muons and 12% for protons. We first require that the MuCL of the SciBar-MRD matched track is greater than 0.05 to reject events with a proton penetrating into the MRD. Then the second track in the event is classified as a pion-like or a proton-like track with the same MuCL threshold.

Figure 3 shows the maximum energy for \u03bc + \u03c0 events in the MRD stopped sample.

Since the CC-QE interaction is a two-body interaction, one can predict the proton direction from the measured muon momentum and muon angle.
