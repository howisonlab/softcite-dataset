QCD describes mesons and baryons as being composed of color-charged quarks (q) and anti-quarks that interact via the exchange of gluons (g). Two non-trivial aspects of QCD are that the gluons carry color charge and that color is absolutely confined into color-neutral objects. These aspects make it complicated to understand the structure of mesons and baryons, and lead to emergent phenomena that are not readily evident from the QCD Lagrangian. The quest to understand how the proton gets its spin from its constituents is one avenue to tackling the big question regarding color confinement.",

            "text": "Spin-orbit correlations and qg correlations are two suggestions by theory why transverse SSA are so large. Transverse momentum (k T ) can be correlated with the spin of either the quark or hadron. This k T can be either in the initial state [2]  (Sivers effect) or in the fragmentation of partons into hadrons [3]  (Collins effect). An issue for the Sivers effect is that factorization theorems have not been proven for the use of k T -dependent distribution functions to describe inclusive particle production in hadronic interactions, except in the case of Drell-Yan production. Factorization is used for collinear calculations [4] that use qg correlators [5]. The qg correlators can appear in the initial state or in the fragmentation, but are collinear so do not involve k T . Explicit relations between initial-state qg correlators and k T moments of the Sivers function have been found [6]. The Sivers function is important to understand because it can provide new insight into the structure of the proton, regarding the role of orbital motion of the confined partons [7,8], although model independent connections have not been found.

Each ring has two full snakes that each precess the polarization by 180 \u2022 . Beams are transversely polarized in the rings. Spin rotator magnets can precess the polarization to become longitudinal at STAR and PHENIX.

Preserving beam polarization in high-energy synchrotrons is difficult because of many intrinsic and imperfection resonances that can depolarize the beams. Collisions of high-energy polarized beams at RHIC are made possible by Siberian Snakes [9]. RHIC realizes this concept by superconducting helical dipole magnets that precess the polarization vector by 180 \u2022 when the beam traverses the magnet, thereby resulting in perturbations of the polarization vector about the stable transverse direction as the polarized beams orbit the ring. Each RHIC ring has two Siberian Snake magnets. Similar magnets at two of the six interaction points (IP) can serve to precess transverse polarization to become longitudinal for collisions, and then restore transverse polarization after the IP. Alternatively, transversely polarized proton collisions can be studied.",

Such local polarimeters require identifying some sort of hadroproduction from colliding beams that has non-zero transverse SSA. Neutrons produced near 0 \u2022 were found to have a non-zero transverse SSA [10]. The particle multiplicity observed in beam-beam counters (scintillator annuli that bracket the IP with acceptance near beam rapidity) was found to have azimuthal modulations correlated with the transverse spin. Finally, neutral pion production at large rapidity was found to have a sizeable transverse SSA [11], although the production rate is such that its use as a local polarimeter is limited.

Operationally, A N requires measurement of integrated luminosity for spin-up (\u2191) and spin-down (\u2193) beams. As well, the beams do not have all particles with spins pointing in a particular direction, but instead are an ensemble of particles having a polarization, P beam , measured in independent counting experiments. For the data in Fig. 2, a carbon fiber was inserted into the beams at regular times for each fill and the spin dependence of recoil carbon ions was measured. The momentum transfer for the elastic scattering of polarized protons from carbon is in the region where the Coulomb amplitude for the process interferes with the nuclear amplitude. This Coulomb-Nuclear Interference (CNI) polarimeter is considered a relative polarimeter, because the spin-dependence of the nuclear amplitude is not known a priori, unlike for the Coulomb amplitude, where the spin dependence is determined from the anomalous magnetic moment of the proton. The effective normalization of the CNI polarimeter is completed by having the high-energy polarized proton beams scatter from a gas jet of hydrogen atoms, where the protons in this jet are   [21]. The \u03c0 0 are detected at midrapidity. Also shown is A N for \u03b7 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 reconstructed at midrapidity.",

Preliminary results have extended the p T range for measurements of A N in neutral pion production out to \u223c 10 GeV/c for p \u2191 + p collisions at \u221a s = 500 GeV [25]. The basic form of the p T dependence of A N for p \u2191 p \u2192 \u03c0X is reminiscent of other transverse SSA phenomena, as measured in fixed-target experiments. Such p T dependencies are observed for the induced polarization of hyperons in unpolarized hadroproduction: e.g. pp \u2192 \u039b \u2191 X. When the \u039b is produced at moderate to large x F it has its spin preferentially (anti) aligned transverse to the production plane. At fixed x F , the induced polarization magnitude increases with p T to a plateau, and then persists to the highest p T values accessible by experiment [26]. Although phenomenological treatments can explain the p T dependence of p \u2191 p \u2192 \u03c0X [31,32], these quantifications do not provide physical insight into this behavior.",

Those explanations are constrained by measurements of transverse SSA in semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering (SIDIS) for both the Sivers [33,34] and Collins effects [35,36], and in e + e \u2212 collisions for the Collins effect [37]. Questions about factorization in SIDIS and e + e \u2212 collisions have been settled. Factorized forms for these transverse SSA exist despite the presence of final-state interactions in SIDIS that are required by gauge invariance, and are required for there to be transverse SSA. Factorized forms also exist for Drell-Yan (DY) production via p \u2191 p \u2192 \u03b3 * X, or for generalized DY production of vector gauge bosons. For DY production, theory predicts the Sivers function will change sign relative to SIDIS because the attractive final-state interaction in the latter [38] become a repulsive initial-state interaction in the former [39]. As will be discussed below, this prediction awaits an experimental test. Complications for p \u2191 p \u2192 \u03c0X are that a mix of initial-state and final-state interactions are in general possible and that factorization for TMD distribution functions has not been proved.",

Collins contributions are not present, to the extent that the jet finding integrates over all fragments, as suggested it does from comparions of particle jet results to hard scattered partons (Fig. 10). Consequently, in the TMD framework, A N for forward jet production arises only from the Sivers effect. The anticipated cancellation of \u03c0 + and \u03c0 \u2212 contributions is observed, in that the magnitude of the jet A N is small. Comparisons to theory that fit the Sivers function deduced from SIDIS are shown in Fig. 11. The generalized parton model (GPM) assumes factorization, and uses the Sivers function from SIDIS directly in their calculation [31]. Error bands on the calculation reflect uncertainties in the Sivers functions from SIDIS. The twist-3 calculation uses soft-gluon pole qg correlators constrained to k T moments of the Sivers function [55]. This calculation has been cited as evidence of the color-charge reinteractions that give rise to the predicted sign change from SIDIS to DY. Mention should be made of A N for x F < 0. The p \u2191 p \u2192 \u03c0X results generally have A N consistent with zero at negative x F . The jet A N does have a negative analyzing power with a \u223c 3.5 sigma signficance at x F \u2248 \u22120.4. As we heard at this workshop [56], tri-gluon correlators do predict negative analyzing power for jet production at large negative x F . For the forward jet production, the beam with p z opposite to that of the detected jet is a source of low-x partons, in a conventional 2 \u2192 2 partonic scattering picture for the particle production. That same picture requires that partons from the p z < 0 proton have a broad distribution in x. Forward dijets select the low-x component of that distribution, so could be of interest to further probe tri-gluon correlator contributions.",

I think we should be careful with our language, in that not all clusters of energy deposition are jets. Jets should be clustered energy depositions that are related back to the momentum of scattered partons. Absent that connection, it is difficult to relate an experimental observable to an object treated by theory. The second caution is in regard to trigger bias, and its impact on reconstructed jets. An example of this was obtained from the apparatus in Fig. 9. That apparatus was the first stage of what was to become an experiment that would measure spin observables for DY production [12]. As such, there were small electromagnetic calorimeter (ECal) modules. The ECal modules were used to trigger (via a sum of ADC values from all cells of each ECal module, corresponding after final calibrations to E ECal \u2265 22 GeV) readout for a small sample of events obtained in p \u2191 p collisions at \u221a s = 500 GeV. Jets from that data sample were reconstructed and compared to jets reconstructed from HCal-triggered readout. Tower-multiplicity distributions are shown in Fig. 12. Evident in that figure is that jets triggered by the ECal modules bias the fragmentation. The bias extends well beyond the \u2248 22 GeV ECal-trigger threshold. Comparing transverse SSA in the right panel of the figure shows that the bias impacts the spin observable, most likely because the jets include high-energy neutral pions as selected by the ECal-trigger.",

The COMPASS collaboration will begin a polarized DY experiment later this year [57]. There are proposals to pursue polarized DY production at many laboratories, as also described at this workshop [58]. RHIC remains the only facility with polarized proton beams, and remains the world's first and only polarized proton collider. It is natural to exploit this uniqueness to address the physics question regarding the sign change of the Sivers function. The issues to be aware of include the precision to which we presently know the Sivers function from SIDIS and whether we have sufficient understanding of how the Sivers function evolves with resolution scale. Most polarized DY measurements will require M \u03b3 * > 4 GeV/c 2 (as set by background considerations), corresponding to a resolution scale of 16 GeV 2 , whereas the SIDIS measurements have < Q 2 >\u2248 2.4 GeV 2 [33] and 3.8 GeV 2 [34].",

The high energy of the collider results in large partonic luminosity, to partly overcome the nucleon-nucleon luminosity advantage of fixedtarget experiments. Estimates of backgrounds were made for a forward calorimeter system with tracking detectors that would observe e + e \u2212 dileptons from the virtual photon, with the conclusion that backgrounds can be reduced to < 10% of the virtual photon signal. The measurement consists of e/\u03b3/hadron discrimination by differences of their interactions in matter, as they shower in a calorimeter system. A preshower detector before an electromagnetic calorimeter (ECal) and a hadron calorimeter after the ECal are the primary tools to suppress backgrounds. The proposal to make this a specific experiment at IP2 at RHIC was not implemented, so that the interaction region could be used for a coherent electron cooling experiment. There is a proposal to implement this concept at STAR, as described at this workshop [59]. That proposal includes design and construction of new forward calorimetry, so likely would not be available for a polarized DY experiment prior to 2020.",

A test of this calorimeter was done in the 2014 RHIC run, which included 3 He+Au collisions at \u221a s NN = 200 GeV. The calorimeter proved to be robust against challenging beam conditions, as is a requirement for p \u2191 p \u2192 \u03b3 * X.

In addition, the calorimeteric system for polarized DY in the forward direction looks promising for reconstruction of \u039b [51], although discrimination of \u039b is difficult. This opens the prospects for a measurement of induced polarization at large x F and for a measurement of polarization transfer (D NN ) for p \u2191 p \u2192 \u039b \u2191 X at \u221a s = 500 GeV.
