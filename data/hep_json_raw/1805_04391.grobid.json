            "text": "The first measurement of e + e \u2212 pair production at mid-rapidity (|\u03b7 e | < 0.8) in pp collisions at \u221a s = 7 TeV with ALICE at the LHC is presented. The dielectron production is studied as a function of the invariant mass (m ee < 3.3 GeV/c 2 ), the pair transverse momentum (p T,ee < 8 GeV/c), and the pair transverse impact parameter (DCA ee ), i.e., the average distance of closest approach of the reconstructed electron and positron tracks to the collision vertex, normalised to its resolution. The results are compared with the expectations from a cocktail of known hadronic sources and are well described when PYTHIA is used to generate the heavy-flavour contributions. In the low-mass region (0.14 < m ee < 1.1 GeV/c 2 ), prompt and non-prompt e + e \u2212 sources can be separated via the DCA ee . In the intermediate-mass region (1.1 < m ee < 2.7 GeV/c 2 ), a double-differential fit to the data in m ee and p T,ee and a fit of the DCA ee distribution allow the total cc and bb cross sections to be extracted. Two different event generators, PYTHIA and POWHEG, can reproduce the shape of the two-dimensional m ee and p T,ee spectra, as well as the shape of the DCA ee distribution, reasonably well. However, differences in the cc and bb cross sections are observed when using the generators to extrapolate to full phase space. Finally, the ratio of inclusive to decay photons is studied via the measurement of virtual direct photons in the transverse-momentum range 1 < p T < 8 GeV/c. This is found to be unity within the statistical and systematic uncertainties and consistent with expectations from next-to-leading order perturbative quantum chromodynamic calculations.",

            "text": "Electron-positron pairs are produced at all stages of the collision. Since they are not affected by the strong interaction, they can escape from the dense medium without finalstate interaction, and are suited to probe the entire time evolution and dynamics of the JHEP09(2018)064 system. At low invariant masses of the dielectron pairs (m ee < 1.1 GeV/c 2 ), e + e \u2212 spectra are sensitive to the properties of vector mesons \u03c1, \u03c9, and \u03c6 in the medium. The \u03c1 meson has a shorter lifetime (\u2248 1.3 fm/c in its rest frame) than that of the medium (\u2248 10 fm/c [11]). Therefore, its spectral function, which can be measured through its dielectron decay channel, is affected by the dense medium and the predicted restoration of chiral symmetry [12][13][14]. Thermal radiation emitted by the system, both during the partonic and hadronic phase [9,10], contributes to the dielectron yield over a broad mass range. In the intermediate-mass region (IMR, 1.1 < m ee < 2.7 GeV/c 2 ), the measurement of thermal dielectrons from the QGP is very challenging at the LHC due to the dominant contribution of e + e \u2212 pairs from semileptonic decays of charm and beauty hadrons, correlated through flavour conservation. 1 The continuum produced by these decays is sensitive to the energy loss [15][16][17][18][19] and the degree of thermalisation of charm and beauty quarks in the medium, as well as the heavy-quark hadronisation mechanism, e.g. recombination of heavy quarks with light quarks from the thermalised medium [20][21][22]. To single out the interesting signal characteristics of the QGP, it is crucial to understand the dielectron yield from primordial heavy-flavour production. The latter can be studied in proton-proton (pp) collisions, which serve as a reference for the analysis of heavy-ion collisions and provide a test for perturbative QCD (pQCD) calculations and Monte Carlo (MC) event generators. Complementary to single-electron or D meson measurements, the yield of correlated e + e \u2212 pairs from charmhadron decays contains information about kinematical correlations between the c and c quarks, i.e. the production mechanisms, and is sensitive to soft heavy-flavour production.",

            "text": "At the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC), the PHENIX and STAR Collaborations found that the dielectron production in pp collisions at \u221a s = 200 GeV is well described by a cocktail of expected hadronic sources [23][24][25]. In addition, PHENIX measured the total cc and bb cross sections in pp and d-Au collisions at \u221a s NN = 200 GeV by fitting the spectra of e + e \u2212 pairs from heavy-flavour hadron decays simultaneously in m ee and pair transverse momentum p T,ee [26,27]. At this energy and in the PHENIX acceptance, the yield from correlated pairs from beauty-hadron decays dominates across all mass regions for p T,ee > 2.5 GeV/c, whereas the cc contribution is preeminent for m ee < 3 GeV/c 2 and p T,ee < 2 GeV/c. The extraction of the heavy-flavour cross sections, in particular the total cc cross section, depends nevertheless on the event generator used to extrapolate the measurements to full phase space. Finally, at lower masses (m ee < 0.3 GeV/c 2 ) and high p T,ee (p T,ee > 1 GeV/c), i.e. the quasi-real virtual-photon region where the p T,ee of the dilepton pair is much larger than its mass (p 2 T,ee m 2 ee ), the measured e + e \u2212 yield was used to study the production of virtual direct photons. The corresponding yield of real direct photons in pp and d-Au collisions is reproduced by next-to-leading order perturbative quantum chromodynamic (NLO pQCD) calculations [24,28]. At the LHC, no significant signal of direct photons for p T < 16 GeV/c could be extracted from the inclusive photon measurements in pp collisions at \u221a s = 2.76 TeV and 8 TeV by the ALICE Collaboration [29]. However, the results are consistent with expectations from NLO pQCD calculations, which predict a smaller contribution of direct photons to the inclusive photon spectrum with increasing \u221a s.",

            "text": "In heavy-ion collisions, a strong enhancement at low invariant mass of dilepton pairs (m ll < 1 GeV/c 2 ) is observed at different energies, at the Super Proton Synchroton (SPS) by the CERES and NA60 Collaborations [30][31][32][33][34][35] and at RHIC energies by the PHENIX and STAR Collaborations [24,[36][37][38]. The data can be explained by thermal radiation of the hadronic phase, dominated by the \u03c1 meson, which appears strongly broadened [39][40][41][42][43][44][45][46][47] with essentially no change of the pole mass. This broadening is consistent with chiral symmetry restoration [14]. At RHIC, the data show a further excess of the direct-photon yield over the pp expectation, which is exponential in p T with an inverse slope T of about 221 MeV [24]. This excess can be attributed to thermal radiation from the partonic and/or hadronic phase [46,48,49]. At the LHC, a similar enhancement of the direct-photon production, with T \u2248 297 MeV, is observed in central Pb-Pb collisions at \u221a s NN = 2.76 TeV [50]. In the IMR, a significant excess over the yield from semileptonic decays of heavy-flavour hadrons is found at the SPS [34,35,51,52], whereas at RHIC the data can be fairly well described by calculations including heavy-flavour contributions estimated in pp collisions and scaled with the number of binary collisions [24,[36][37][38]. At the SPS, the NA60 Collaboration showed, by using precise vertex information, that the excess is associated with a prompt source, as opposed to \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 pairs from D mesons that decay further away from the interaction point [51]. The analysis of the p T,\u00b5\u00b5 -spectra, with the extraction of the slope parameter T eff as a function of m \u00b5\u00b5 , revealed that the IMR is dominated by an early source of dileptons, i.e. partonic radiation, where radial flow is negligible [52]. Models including thermal radiation from the QGP [39,41,42,53] can reproduce the data in the IMR. In this paper, the first measurement of the e + e \u2212 pair production in pp collisions at \u221a s = 7 TeV with ALICE at the LHC is presented. The invariant yield is studied within the central barrel acceptance of ALICE (|\u03b7 e | < 0.8) as a function of m ee (m ee < 3.3 GeV/c 2 ), p T,ee (p T,ee < 8 GeV/c), and DCA ee (DCA ee < 10 \u03c3), i.e. the average distance of closest approach of the reconstructed electron and positron tracks to the collision vertex, normalised to its resolution. The latter allows the prompt and non-prompt dielectron sources to be separated and provides an additional variable to disentangle the contributions from cc (with c\u03c4 \u2248 150 \u00b5m for D mesons) and bb (with c\u03c4 \u2248 470 \u00b5m for B mesons). The data are compared with a cocktail of expected e + e \u2212 sources from known hadrons based on measured cross sections. Correlated pairs from heavy-flavour hadron decays are calculated with two different MC event generators, PYTHIA [54] and POWHEG [55][56][57][58]. Finally, the relative contribution of virtual direct photons is shown and compared with NLO pQCD calculations.",

Reconstructed charged-particle tracks in the ITS and TPC are selected in |\u03b7| < 0.8 and p T > 0.2 GeV/c. For the DCA ee analysis, the tracks must have a p T > 0.4 GeV/c to assure a sufficient separation between prompt and non-prompt e + e \u2212 sources. The DCA resolution worsens at low p T and is larger than 150 \u00b5m for tracks reconstructed in the ITS and TPC with p T < 0.35 GeV/c [59], which is of the same order of magnitude as the decay length of the D 0 and D \u00b1 s mesons (c\u03c4 \u2248 122.9 and 149.9 \u00b5m, respectively). The tracks are required to have at least 100 out of a maximum of 159 reconstructed space points in the TPC with at least 100 crossed pad-rows, while the ITS track segments must have a hit in at least 5 of the 6 detector layers. The maximum \u03c7 2 per space point in the TPC (ITS) from the track fit must be less than 4 (4.5). Only tracks with a DCA to the primary vertex smaller than 1 cm in the xy-plane and 3 cm along the z-axis are accepted. To suppress electron tracks from photon conversions in the detector material at large radii, a hit in the first layer of the SPD is required. This rejects about 63% of the conversion electron tracks, keeping 83% of the signal electrons from light and heavy-flavour hadron decays. A small fraction of electrons from photon conversions in the second ITS layer may still have a hit in the first layer associated wrongly to their reconstructed track. Such cases are further removed from the sample by requiring that the reconstructed track does not share any ITS cluster with other tracks (see below). This requirement also reduces the amount of conversion electrons from the first ITS layer, rejecting 38% of the remaining conversion contamination after the requirement of a hit in the first SPD layer and keeping 97% of the signal electrons. For e + e \u2212 pairs from photon conversions, where both electrons pass the default track selection, the rejection factor is even higher, about 92%.",

Additionally, pions are rejected by requiring that the measured TPC dE/dx of the track is far from the expectation value for pions: n TPC \u03c3\u03c0 > 3.5. Since electrons have a larger energy loss in the TPC than pions for momenta above 0.25 GeV/c, the n TPC \u03c3\u03c0 requirement is asymmetric. The remaining contamination by kaons and protons occurs mainly in the crossing regions of the expected dE/dx values in the TPC for these particle species and for electrons, i.e. around a momentum of 0.5 and 1.1 GeV/c, respectively. This contamination can be reduced by using the ITS information, where the crossings occur at higher momenta around 0.7 and 1.5 GeV/c for kaons and protons, respectively. In the left panel of figure 1, the variable n TPC \u03c3e is shown as a function of n ITS \u03c3e for selected tracks with 0.5 < p < 0.52 GeV/c after the pion rejection in the TPC was applied. In this momentum interval, kaons and electrons have a very similar energy loss in the TPC, whereas they are still separated in the energy loss measurements of the ITS. The electron selection criterion in the ITS is \u22123 < n ITS \u03c3e < 1. Further reduction of the hadron contamination can be achieved using the TOF information with |n TOF \u03c3e | < 3 (in case the selected tracks have an associated hit in the TOF detector). The electron purity P e is estimated at low momenta (p < 3 GeV/c) by fitting the n TPC \u03c3e distribution in momentum slices after the ITS and TOF selection, as well as the n TPC \u03c3\u03c0 rejection, following a procedure explained in [65]. At higher momenta, the n TPC \u03c3\u03c0 distribution is fitted after the requirements on n ITS \u03c3e , n TOF \u03c3e , and n TPC \u03c3e , are fulfilled. The result is shown in the right panel of figure 1. The purity ranges from 60% to 99%, depending on the particle momentum p. The lowest purity is observed where kaons (p \u2248 0.5 GeV/c) or protons (p \u2248 1.2 GeV/c) have similar dE/dx as electrons in the TPC. ",

Typical values of S/B range between O(1) and O(10 \u22121 ), depending on m ee and p T,ee (see below). Therefore, the minimisation of B and a careful subtraction of the remaining background are key aspects of this analysis.",

The extrapolation of displaced conversion electron tracks to the collision point results in a non-vanishing artificial opening angle that is caused by the deflection of the tracks in the magnetic field.

In the left panel of figure 4, the measured \u03d5 v distribution without ITS shared-cluster cut for m ee < 0.1 GeV/c 2 and p T,ee < 8 GeV/c is compared with the sum of two MC templates, one for pairs from \u03c0 0 and \u03b7 Dalitz decays and one for pairs from photon conversions, fitted to the data. Prompt pairs with finite invariant mass have an almost uniform \u03d5 v distribution in this kinematic domain, while conversion pairs show a peak around \u03d5 v = \u03c0. To reject these conversions, reconstructed electron tracks that share at least one ITS cluster with another track are not used in the analysis. The measured \u03d5 v distribution after this requirement is shown in the right panel of figure 4. The conversion peak around \u03d5 v = \u03c0 is clearly suppressed. The MC simulations describe the data very well. Moreover, dielectron pairs with \u03d5 v > 2 rad and m ee < 0.1 GeV/c 2 are removed from the selected pairs to further reduce the amount of conversion electrons. From MC studies, their final contribution is expected to be below 1% down to m ee = 0. The remaining background B is estimated from the distribution of same-sign pairs, SS, from the same event. In comparison to a mixed-event approach, the same-sign approximation of the combinatorial background has the advantage of containing all residual correlations arising from charge-symmetric processes such as jet fragmentation or conversions of decay photons from the same mother particle that are present in B, but the disadvantage of suffering from the limited statistics available in the analysed data sample. The same-sign distribution SS is computed in the same bins of m ee , p T,ee , and DCA ee as the OS distributions by forming in each bin the geometric mean SS = 2\u2022 \u221a N ++ N \u2212\u2212 of the number of (++) and (\u2212\u2212) pairs, N ++ and N \u2212\u2212 , respectively. The geometric mean is robust against charge asymmetries in the electron sample, as they may arise from acceptance differences of positive and negative tracks, and from charge asymmetries of the hadronic background. In the present data set, charge asymmetries of up to 5% are observed, depending on p T . MC simulations confirm that such asymmetries do not lead to a bias in the estimate of B if the geometric mean is used for the same-sign background calculation. In a few bins with low pair statistics, however, N ++ or N \u2212\u2212 is zero. In such bins, the arithmetic sum SS = N ++ +N \u2212\u2212 is used instead, to avoid underestimation of the combinatorial background.",

A realistic detector response is modelled using GEANT3 [68], with the same detector configurations as in data.

Also no strong \u03b7 dependence of e is observed within |\u03b7| < 0.8 as well, whereas the dead zones of the first ITS layer can be seen in the \u03d5 distribution of the electron candidates due to the requirement of a hit in the first pixel.

            "text": "The systematic uncertainties arise from limitations in the determination of the background, the relative acceptance correction factor R acc , the electron selection efficiency, the prefilter efficiency, and the pair-cut efficiency. These uncertainties are evaluated by varying all the electron and pair selection criteria simultaneously and by comparing the results with and without prefilter. Table 1 summarises the single-track selection criteria variations. The signal is extracted and corrected for 22 random combinations of selection criteria, which probe different but still reasonable single-electron efficiencies and S/B ratios, ranging from 0.22 to 0.42 at p T = 1 GeV/c and from about 0.05 to 0.15 at m ee = 0.5 GeV/c 2 , respectively. More than one selection criteria are varied at the same time to take into account possible correlations between them. The final systematic uncertainty is calculated as the root mean square of the variation of the final data points. These extracted systematic uncertainties contain not only systematic effects from the signal efficiency, but also from the background estimation. The maximum \u03d5 v requirement for pairs with m ee < 0.1 GeV/c 2 is also varied, around the default value of 2 rad, from 1.57 to 2.5 rad. Deviations from a flat \u03d5 v distribution for the signal dielectron pairs are estimated with a MC simulation and found to lead to a systematic uncertainty below 1% for the default \u03d5 v requirement. The resulting systematic uncertainties from the selection criterion variation is listed in table 2 in the case of the DCA analysis with p T,e > 0.4 GeV/c. An additional source of systematic uncertainty is considered for the DCA ee -differential dielectron cross section. The electron efficiency is found to be independent on the singletrack DCA within the range under study by checking the fraction of reconstructed electrons as a function of the distance of their production vertex to the reconstructed primary vertex in MC. However, some correlations still remain between p T,ee and DCA ee . In the \u03c0 0 mass region (0.08 < m ee < 0.14 GeV/c 2 ), the mean p T,ee is approximately constant as a function of DCA ee , which is expected since the electron tracks should always point to the primary vertex for a prompt source, and the finite DCA ee values are only due to the detector resolution. This is not the case for the J/\u03c8 region (2.7 < m ee < 3.3 GeV/c 2 ), where the mean p T,ee exhibits an increase as a function of DCA ee . The reasons are twofold: first, non-prompt J/\u03c8 from feed-down from B-mesons have a harder p T spectrum than prompt J/\u03c8, and second, high-p T non-prompt J/\u03c8 decay farther away than low-p T non-prompt J/\u03c8 so that the decay electrons have larger DCAs and larger p T compared to electrons from low-p T non-prompt J/\u03c8. The possible remaining uncertainty from this correlation is estimated by half the difference of the pair efficiency at the maximum and minimum meanp T,ee , seen as a function of DCA ee in a given mass region. This systematic uncertainty is found to be less than 5%, increasing from low to high m ee . Table 2 summarises the systematic uncertainties arising from the DCA analysis.",

For the decay of the other vector mesons, which are assumed to be unpolarised, the Gounaris-Sakurai expression [76] is used. The rapidity distribution of the mesons is assumed to be flat at mid-rapidity. The momentum distributions of \u03c0 0 , \u03b7, \u03c6, and J/\u03c8 are obtained by fitting the spectra measured by the ALICE Collaboration [77][78][79][80] with a modified Hagedorn function [81]. The measured \u03c0 \u00b1 and \u03c0 0 spectra agree within their systematic uncertainties. Since the \u03c0 \u00b1 measurement extends to lower p T , and exhibits smaller uncertainties than the \u03c0 0 , charged pions are used to approximate neutral pions. For the other mesons, \u03c1, \u03c9, and \u03b7 , the shape of their p T spectra is derived from the \u03c0 \u00b1 spectrum. The \u03b7 mesons are generated assuming m T scaling [82][83][84], implying that the spectra of all light mesons as a function of m T = m 2 + p 2 T are the same and only differ by a normalisation factor. The normalisation factors are based on the ratio of the p T spectra of the given hadron to the p T spectrum of the \u03c0 \u00b1 at high p T : 0.4 \u00b1 0.08 for \u03b7 from PYTHIA 6 calculations of pp collisions at \u221a s = 7 TeV, 0.85 \u00b1 0.17 for \u03c9 obtained from measurements in pp collisions at \u221a s = 7 TeV [85], and 1.0 \u00b1 0.2 for \u03c1 obtained from measurements in pp collisions at \u221a s = 2.76 TeV [86]. The momentum distributions of \u03c9 and \u03c1 are obtained from the \u03c9/\u03c0 \u00b1 and \u03c1/\u03c0 \u00b1 ratios in simulated pp collisions at \u221a s = 7 TeV with the Monash 2013 tune of PYTHIA 8 [87,88]. This tune describes the measured \u03c9/\u03c0 0 and \u03c1/\u03c0 0 ratios in pp collisions at \u221a s = 7 TeV and 2.76 TeV, respectively. Since the \u03c9 measurement does not extend to low p T (the \u03c9 meson is measured for p T > 2 GeV/c), fits of the data are used only to estimate the systematic uncertainties.",

The calculations presented in this paper (POWHEG) are obtained with the POWHEG BOX framework [57,58] and the tune Perugia-2011 of PYTHIA 6.4.25. The CTEQ6.6 [92] functions are used for the input parton distribution functions. To be consistent with the PYTHIA simulations, the mass of the charm and beauty quarks are set to 1.  [89]), the one for charm-to-electron (BR c\u2192e ) is assumed to be (9.6 \u00b1 0.4)% as reported in [89], which is slightly smaller than what has been estimated with PYTHIA (BR c\u2192e = 10.6%). An additional uncertainty of 9.3% is added in quadrature for the BR c\u2192e to take into account differences in the \u039b + c /D 0 ratio measured by the ALICE Collaboration, 0.543\u00b10.061(stat.)\u00b10.160(syst.) (for p T > 1 GeV/c) in pp collisions at \u221a s = 7 TeV [95], and the LEP average of 0.113 \u00b1 0.013(stat.) \u00b1 0.006(syst.) [96]. This translates into a 22% uncertainty at the pair level. The uncertainties of the effective beauty-and charm-to-electron branching ratios are propagated to the final hadronic cocktail. For both generators, the p T -differential cross-section of single electrons from charm-and beauty-hadron decays at mid-rapidity is found to be consistent with FONLL calculations [97] and to reproduce the measurements reasonably well within the theoretical and experimental uncertainties [98]. To obtain the dielectron yield of correlated e + e \u2212 pairs from heavy-flavour hadron decays, the distribution of same-sign pairs is subtracted from the e + e \u2212 spectrum, as in data. applied. Since the various charm hadrons have quite different decay lengths, ranging from about 59.9 \u00b5m for \u039b \u00b1 c to 311.8 \u00b5m for D \u00b1 mesons [89], their relative yields are relevant to build the DCA ee template of correlated e + e \u2212 pairs from charm-hadron decays. The measured production ratios of charm hadrons [95,99] and their semileptonic decay branching ratios [89] are used to obtain the cc DCA ee distribution. Finally, DCA ee templates are extracted for e + e \u2212 pairs from \u03c0 0 Dalitz decays, from charm-and beauty-hadron decays, and from the decays of prompt and non-prompt J/\u03c8. In figure 8, the \u03c0 0 , cc, and bb templates are shown integrated over p T,ee and m ee . Whereas the distributions for prompt sources, like \u03c0 0 , directly reflect the detector DCA resolution, those of non-prompt sources, like heavy-flavour hadrons, are characterised by the convolution of the DCA resolution and the decay length of the mother particle (c\u03c4 D \u2248 150 \u00b5m and c\u03c4 B \u2248 470 \u00b5m [89]). The DCA ee spectrum of e + e \u2212 pairs from \u03c0 0 Dalitz decays is taken as an approximation for all prompt light-flavour decays into dielectrons.",

Third, the PYTHIA simulations used to create the DCA ee templates for the heavy-flavour contributions have been performed with the PYTHIA Perugia-0 tune [67], which does not reproduce well the measured p T distribution of electrons from charm-hadron decays at high p T (p T > 3 GeV/c) [98]. This was found to have a negligible effect on the final DCA ee template, by varying the maximum p T requirement on the single electron track (p T < 3 GeV/c). Moreover, the charm and beauty DCA ee templates do not exhibit any strong dependence on p T,ee and m ee , as well as on the minimum electron p T requirement. The latter is varied from 0.4 GeV/c to 0.7 GeV/c. Therefore, the shape of the heavy-flavour MC templates is assumed to be model independent, whereas their absolute normalisation, i.e. the dielectron yields from charm-and beauty-hadron decays in the given p T,ee and m ee range, is not. The same DCA ee distributions are used for the two event generators, PYTHIA and POWHEG, and normalised to the dielectron yield predicted in each mass interval by the corresponding event generator.",

The template for e + e \u2212 pairs from prompt light-flavour hadron decays cannot describe the tail of the DCA ee distribution. The latter is well reproduced by additional contributions from correlated pairs of heavy-flavour hadron decays. The good agreement between data and MC validates the possibility to separate prompt from non-prompt dielectron sources via this observable.  as for the PYTHIA cocktail, the POWHEG calculations tend to underestimate the data, in particular in the region where the cc contribution dominates. This indicates a sensitivity of the present data to the underlying heavy-quark production mechanism implemented in the two models. The latter can result in different kinematic correlations of the QQ pair and therefore different probabilities for the e + e \u2212 pair to enter the detector acceptance. Table 3 summarises the fraction of correlated e + e \u2212 pairs in the full phase space (4\u03c0) and after consecutive acceptance selection criteria for the cc and bb contributions. The fraction of dielectron pairs from charm-hadron decays where both electrons are found at mid-rapidity (|\u03b7 e \u00b1 | < 0.8) is about 5.2% and 7.5% for the POWHEG and PYTHIA simulation, respectively. Since the hadronisation of the charm and beauty quarks, as well as the decay kinematics of the heavy-flavour hadrons, are the same in both calculations, this difference results from different treatments of the various production processes of the cc pair by the two event generators. First, the rapidity distribution of charm quarks predicted by POWHEG is slighly broader than the one from PYTHIA, leading to a smaller probability for single electrons to fall into the acceptance at mid-rapidity in POWHEG (17.3%) as com-  Table 3.

Second, the pseudorapidity correlation between the electron and positron from charm-hadron decays gives rise to a larger acceptance for e + e \u2212 pairs at mid-rapidity than from a purely random correlation. The pseudorapidity correlation is model-dependent which increases the difference in acceptance between the two generators to about 46%. For electrons from beauty-hadron decays, the model dependences are smaller, on the order of 7%. The rapidity distributions of beauty quarks predicted by POWHEG and PYTHIA are quite similar. Moreover, about 50% of the correlated e + e \u2212 pairs from beauty hadron decays originate from a single B hadron (B \u2192 De + X \u2192 e + e \u2212 X) and are insensitive to the correlations between the B and B hadrons. Due to the large mass of the B hadrons, the correlation between the decay electron and the parent meson is diluted and the pseudorapidity correlation of the e + e \u2212 pairs originating from different B hadrons is less related to the correlation between the b and b but more driven by decay kinematics. templates normalised to the PYTHIA cocktail. The shape of the MC DCA ee distribution for correlated e + e \u2212 pairs from charm-hadron decays deviates from the data at large DCA ee . The additional contribution from e + e \u2212 pairs from beauty-hadron decays allows the data to be well described, as can be seen with the pull distribution presented in the bottom panel of figure 14.

The statistical uncertainties are plotted as ellipses and correspond to a confidence level of 68.3% (1\u03c3) for each parameter (at \u03c7 2 = \u03c7 2 min + 1 [101]). The error bars represent the systematic uncertainties determined by the fit result after moving the data points coherently up-and downward by their systematic uncertainties. The uncertainties of the effective beauty-and charm-to-electron branching ratios are shown as coloured bands. Finally the full and dashed lines show \u03c3 REF cc [93] and \u03c3 REF bb [94] with their total uncertainties. The statistical and systematic uncertainties are fully correlated between the PYTHIA-and POWHEG-based results, whereas they are partially correlated between the (m ee , p T,ee ) and DCA ee fits. Both calculations, PYTHIA and POWHEG, are able to reproduce the (m ee , p T,ee ) and DCA ee spectra reasonably well and give similar minimum \u03c7 2 per number of degree of freedom (0.999 for POWHEG and 0.989 for PYTHIA for the (m ee , p T,ee ) fit). The fit results of the (m ee , p T,ee ) and DCA ee spectra are in agreement within the statistical and systematic uncertainties. The DCA ee distribution is slightly less sensitive to the total bb cross section. hadron decays only dominate the last DCA ee bin (see figure 14). The shapes of the MC DCA ee templates are driven by the decay kinematics and assumed to be model independent. Therefore the extracted \u03c3 cc and \u03c3 bb directly reflect the different probabilities for the e + e \u2212 pair to enter the detector acceptance calculated with PYTHIA or POWHEG (see table 3). The (m ee , p T,ee ) fit depends in addition on the p T,ee distributions of correlated e + e \u2212 pairs from charm and beauty-hadron decays, which are harder in POWHEG compared to PYTHIA. The total cc and bb cross sections show model dependences of about a factor of two. The fitted cross sections are summarised in tables 4 and 5. For comparison, the total cc cross section obtained by extrapolating in rapidity the D 0 p T spectrum measured by the ALICE Collaboration [93] is of the order of 8.6 mb with POWHEG, and 7 mb with PYTHIA. The dielectron measurements can give further constraints on the MC event generators aiming to reproduce the heavy-flavour production mechanisms, once the uncertainties, which are fully correlated between the PYTHIA-and POWHEG-based results, are reduced.",

Perturbative QCD calculations at NLO [102] performed with the CT10 PDFs [103][104][105] predict a small ratio of inclusive to decay photon cross sections over the measured p T range, compatible with the measurements within uncertainties. The uncertainty band of the calculation is given by the simultaneous variation of the factorisation, renormalisation, and fragmentation scales (with 0.5p T < \u00b5 F < 2p T for the factorization scale) used in the calculation. The upper limits at 90% confidence level (C.L.) on R \u03b3 , extracted with the Feldman-Cousins method [106], are summarised in table. 6. Gaussian distributions are assumed for statistical and systematic uncertainties, which are treated independently and summed in quadrature. The results are consistent with the R \u03b3 measured in pp collisions at \u221a s = 8 TeV with the real photon analysis performed by the ALICE Collaboration [29].",

In the \u03c0 0 mass region (m ee < 0.14 GeV/c 2 ), the comparison of the measured DCA ee distribution with the MC templates shows that the detector resolution is well reproduced in the simulations. In the low-mass region (0.14 < m ee < 1.1 GeV/c 2 ), prompt and non-prompt contributions can be separated with the DCA ee observable. In the intermediate-mass region, 1.1 < m ee < 2.7 GeV/c 2 , the measured e + e \u2212 cross section is dominated by correlated e + e \u2212 pairs from charm-and beauty-hadron decays. The cc and bb total cross sections can be extracted from the data by a double-differential fit of the measured spectra in (m ee , p T,ee ) and by fitting the DCA ee distribution in the IMR. Both fits give consistent results within statistical and systematic uncertainties. The extracted cross sections show a large model-dependence between PYTHIA and POWHEG by up to a factor of two. In the J/\u03c8 mass region (2.7 < m ee < 3.3 GeV/c 2 ), the measured DCA ee -and p T,ee -differential cross sections are well described by the hadronic cocktail. The DCA ee distribution is sensitive to the fraction f B of non-prompt J/\u03c8 originating from B-meson decays. The data are consistent with the previously measured f B by the ALICE Collaboration [100].",
