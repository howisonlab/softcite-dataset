The accuracy of these measurements is about 25-30% and the |G E | = |G M | assumption is made. In the PS170 experiment at LEAR [6] the measurement of the effective proton form factor and the first measurement of the |G E /G M | ratio have been performed in the process pp \u2192 e + e \u2212 with 30% accuracy.

The design luminosity of the VEPP-2000 is 10 32 cm \u22122 s \u22121 at the maximum center-of-mass energy E c.m. = 2 GeV. The detector tracking system consists of the cylindrical drift chamber (DC) and double-layer cylindrical multiwire proportional Z-chamber, both used for a trigger, and both installed inside a thin (0.2 X 0 ) superconducting solenoid with 1.3 T field. The beam pipe inside the DC is made of 0.5 mm aluminum with 17 mm inner radius. An inner shell of DC is made of a carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) and has 20 mm radius. The DC contains 1218 hexagonal cells and allows to measure charged particle momentum with 1.5-4.5% accuracy in the 100-1000 MeV/c range, and provides the measurement of the polar (\u03b8) and azimuthal (\u03c6) angles with  20 mrad and 3.5-8.0 mrad accuracy, respectively. An amplitude information from the DC wires is used to measure ionization losses of charged particles with \u03c3 dE/dx =11-14% accuracy. Two electromagnetic calorimeters (a liquid xenon (LXe) one with 5.4 X 0 and CsI crystals with 8.1 X 0 ) are placed in the barrel outside the solenoid. BGO crystals with 13.4 X 0 are used as the end-cap calorimeters. The return yoke of the detector is surrounded by scintillation counters, which are used to veto cosmic events.",

An example of such an event is shown in Fig. 2. When E c.m. is above 952 MeV, almost all nucleons reach the DC sensitive volume, and stop in the DC outer shell or in the Z-chamber. Figure 3 shows an example of an event, when both proton and antiproton are detected in the DC. For beam energies between 950 and 952 MeV, only part of nucleons penetrate into the DC volume.

Using these selections we obtain the proton detection efficiency for data  \u01eb exp reg and MC-simulation \u01eb sim reg , which are calculated as a ratio of the number of events with found protons to that of all events with antiprotons. Because of the large proton background from beam-gas interactions we cannot select a pure sample of detected protons, and assume equal detection efficiencies for protons and antiprotons. The squared ratio of efficiencies found for data and MC-simulation is shown in Fig. 7 vs c.m. energy, and gives an estimate of data-MC difference. We fit these points with a constant and obtain the value R = 1.030 \u00b1 0.014 close to unity and it is used as an estimate of the systematic error on the detection efficiency. At the point E c.m. = 1901.6 MeV we use the correction as determined above, because the effect of material and thickness uncertainties of the beam pipe is too big.",
