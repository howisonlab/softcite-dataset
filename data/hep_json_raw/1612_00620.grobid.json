            "text": "Final results are presented from the inclusive measurement of deep-inelastic polarised-muon scattering on longitudinally polarised deuterons using a 6 LiD target. The data were taken at 160 GeV beam energy and the results are shown for the kinematic range 1 (GeV/c) 2 < Q 2 < 100 (GeV/c) 2 in photon virtuality, 0.004 < x < 0.7 in the Bjorken scaling variable and W > 4 GeV/c 2 in the mass of the hadronic final state. The deuteron double-spin asymmetry A d 1 and the deuteron longitudinal-spin structure function g d 1 are presented in bins of x and Q 2 . Towards lowest accessible values of x, g d 1 decreases and becomes consistent with zero within uncertainties. The presented final g d 1 values together with the recently published final g p 1 values of COMPASS are used to again evaluate the Bjorken sum rule and perform the QCD fit to the g 1 world data at next-to-leading order of the strong coupling constant. In both cases, changes in central values of the resulting numbers are well within statistical uncertainties. The flavoursinglet axial charge a 0 , which is identified in the MS renormalisation scheme with the total contribution of quark helicities to the nucleon spin, is extracted at next-to-leading order accuracy from only the COMPASS deuteron data: a 0 (Q 2 = 3 (GeV/c) 2 ) = 0.32 \u00b1 0.02 stat \u00b1 0.04 syst \u00b1 0.05 evol . Together with the recent results on the proton spin structure function g p 1 , the results on g d 1 constitute the COMPASS legacy on the measurements of g 1 through inclusive spin-dependent deep inelastic scattering.",

This result initiated enormous experimental and theoretical activities to study the spin structure of the nucleon. In subsequent measurements by SMC [2], an upgraded apparatus was used to confirm with better precision that only about one third of the spin of the nucleon is made up by quark spins. This observation is supported by recent lattice QCD simulations [3].",

These experiments included COM-PASS at CERN using the CERN SPS muon beam line at energies 160 GeV and 200 GeV, HERMES at DESY using the 27.5 GeV electron beam of HERA, many experiments at the 6 GeV electron beam of Jefferson Laboratory, as well as PHENIX and STAR at the protonproton collider RHIC with a centre of mass energy of 270 GeV. Except for the latter two, in all other experiments the longitudinal spin structure of the nucleon was studied by inclusive measurements of spin-dependent deep-inelastic lepton-nucleon scattering (DIS) using longitudinally polarised beams and targets, in particular by measuring double-spin cross-section asymmetries. More details can be found in recent reviews, see e.g. Ref. [4].",

In 2006 the target material was 6 LiD contained in three cells instead of two. They were located along the beam one after the other and had a diameter of 3 cm. The two outermost cells had a length of 30 cm and the central cell was 60 cm long. The deuteron polarisation in 6 LiD was P T \u2248 0.52, and the direction of the target polarisation in the outer cells was opposite to that of the central one. The polarisation direction was inverted on a regular basis by rotating the direction of the target solenoid magnetic field. During the data taking, the direction of the polarisation with respect to the solenoid field was inverted by repolarisation in opposite directions keeping the solenoid field unchanged. The tertiary M2 beam of the CERN SPS delivered a naturally polarised muon beam with a polarisation of P B \u2248 0.8. The nominal momentum was 160 GeV/c with a momentum spread of 5%. Momentum and trajectory of each beam particle were measured by sets of scintillator hodoscopes, scintillating fibre and silicon detectors. The particles produced in an interaction were detected in a two-stage open forward spectrometer with large momentum and angular acceptance. Each stage contained a dipole magnet complemented with various tracking detectors (scintillating fibre detectors, micropattern gaseous detectors, multiwire proportional chambers, drift chambers, straw detectors), as well as hadron and electromagnetic calorimeters. In the first stage, a RICH detector was available for hadron identification. Scattered muons were detected by drift tube planes and multiwire proportional chambers located behind iron and concrete absorbers. Two types of triggers were used in this analysis. The \"inclusive\" trigger was based on a signal from a combination of hodoscope signals from the scattered muon. The \"semiinclusive\" triggers required an energy deposition in one of the calorimeters with an optional coincidence with the inclusive trigger.",

Both asymmetries are found to be consistent with zero. In the other method, \"pulls\" [15] are used to check for time-dependent effects.

In the figure, the two COMPASS data points at lowest x are obtained as averages from the four lowest x bins used in this analysis. The systematic uncertainties are shown by bands at the bottom. The COMPASS data do not support large negative values of the structure function at low x, an indication of which may be seen in the SMC data. Instead, g d 1 is compatible with zero for x decreasing towards the lower limit of the measured range.",

The contributions from the unmeasured regions are estimated using the parameterisations of parton distributions from our NLO QCD analysis [9]. For the region 0 < x < 0.004 the contribution lies between \u22120.0015 and 0.001. Such a small contribution can be expected as g d 1 is consistent with zero for x < 0.02. It is also consistent with zero at scales Q 2 < 1 (GeV/c) 2 where the measurements extend to even lower values of x [11]. For the region 0.7 < x < 1 the contribution to the first moment of g d 1 is as small and equal to 0.001. The contributions from the different x ranges are shown in Table 2. The updated value of the first moment from COMPASS data alone is: N 1 (Q 2 = 3 (GeV/c) 2 ) = 0.046\u00b10.002 stat \u00b10.004 syst \u00b10.005 evol .

The uncertainties of P B and P T dominate, while the impact of possible false asymmetries largely cancels in the discussed integral. An uncertainty of 100% is used for the contribution from the large-x extrapolation, while for the low-x extrapolation the uncertainty is taken as half of the full range, i.e. 0.00125.

(11) The largest contribution to the total uncertainty originates from the uncertainties in the evolution of g d 1 to a common value of Q 2 . This is due to the large uncertainty of the polarised gluon distribution obtained in the fits. The extrapolation uncertainty is given by the extrapolation uncertainty of N 1 as explained above, and is included in the evolution uncertainty. This independent result on a 0 is consistent with the value of a 0 obtained from the COMPASS NLO QCD fit [9] of the world data. Note the remarkably good statistical and systematic accuracy of this result obtained from only the COMPASS deuteron data when comparing to the corresponding accuracy of the fit result [9].",

            "text": "We have presented new results on the longitudinal spin structure function g d 1 from data taken in 2006 and we have combined this data with our previous measurements. All data were taken using the 160 GeV CERN muon beam and a longitudinally polarised 6 LiD target. The results cover the kinematic range 0.004 < x < 0.7, 1 (GeV/c) 2 < Q 2 < 100 (GeV/c) 2 and W > 4 GeV/c 2 . The doublespin asymmetry is studied in bins of x and Q 2 . The combined results for g d 1 at low x (x < 0.03) improve considerably the precision compared to the only existing result in this region, which originates from SMC. Now, g d 1 appears consistent with zero at the presently lowest accessible values of x. The combined set of data was included in our NLO QCD fit to the g p 1 , g d 1 and g n 1 world data. In addition, a re-evaluation of the Bjorken sum rule was performed using only COMPASS results. Both for the QCD NLO fit and the Bjorken sum rule, the new values stay compatible with the published ones within statistical uncertainties. The analysis of the COMPASS deuteron data alone leads to a NLO determination of the flavour-singlet axial charge a 0 = 0.32 \u00b1 0.02 stat \u00b1 0.04 syst \u00b1 0.05 evol at Q 2 = 3 (GeV/c) 2 from the first moment of g d 1 . Together with the results on the proton spin structure function g p 1 [8,9], the results for g d 1 constitute the COMPASS legacy on the measurements of g 1 .",
