            "text": "The exclusive electroproduction of mesons on the nucleon is an important tool to better understand the nucleon structure and, more generally, the transition between the low energy hadronic and high energy partonic domains of the Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) theory. The CEBAF (\"Continous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility\") of the Jefferson Laboratory (JLab) at Newport News (USA) with its high intensity electron beam and its large acceptance spectrometer CLAS [1] (CEBAF Large Acceptance Spectrometer) offers a great opportunity to study the exclusive electroproduction of mesons, in particular those that have multi-particle decays. This proceeding presents the results for the exclusive electroproduction of the vector mesons \u03c1 0 , \u03c9 and \u03c6 on the proton at CLAS and provides a first (preliminary) look at the \u03c1 + channel. These results come mainly from two experiments: the e1-6 and the e1-dvcs experiments. For e1-6, the data were collected between October 2001 and January 2002. The beam energy was 5.754 GeV and the integrated luminosity was 28.5 fb \u22121 . The e1-dvcs data were collected between March and May 2005. The beam energy was 5.75 GeV and the integrated luminosity was \u223c 40 fb \u22121 . The cross sections for the \u03c1 0 , \u03c9 and \u03c6 channels are published in refs. [2,3,4]. For the \u03c1 + channel, it is the first ever measurement of its cross section. The presented results are still preliminary and more details can be found in ref. [6]. The final state that is analyzed is ep \u2192 ep\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 . The final state particles e, p and \u03c0 + were detected in CLAS and the exclusive process was identified by selecting a missing \u03c0 \u2212 with the missing mass technique. Fig. 1 shows the distributions of M X [epX] for some (Q 2 , x B ) bins. One sees clearly the \u03c1 0 peak sitting on top of a background of a non-resonant two-pion continuum. One can also distinguish two bumps at masses around 980 MeV and 1270 MeV corresponding, respectively, to the scalar f 0 and tensor f 2 mesons. After weighting each event with the appropriate acceptance, we have used four contributions to fit these spectra: three skewed Breit-Wigner distributions to describe the \u03c1 0 , f 0 and f 2 resonant structures and a parametrisation of the M \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 non-resonant continuum determined from simulations (mostly ep \u2192 ep\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 phase space). After the background subtraction procedure, total and differential cross sections of the reaction ep \u2192 ep\u03c1 0 were extracted, by calculating for each ( gitudinal cross sections from the transverse ones was performed by analysing the pion decay angles of the \u03c1 0 and relying on the SCHC (s-channel helicity conservation) which was checked experimentally.",

It consists of exchanges of meson \"trajectories\" in the t-channel. In the following, we will use the \"JML\" acronym to refer to the specific model developed by J.-M. Laget and collaborators [8]. For the \u03c1 0 channel, the model consists of t-channel exchanges of \u03c3, f 2 and Pomeron trajectories. For the \u03c9 channel, the exchange particles are \u03c0 0 and Pomeron trajectories. For the \u03c6 channel, the only exchange particle is the Pomeron trajectory. For the \u03c1 + channel, the exchange particles are the \u03c0 + and the \u03c1 + trajectories. The free parameters are the coupling constants at the hadronic vertices (most of them being well constrained) and the mass scales of the electromagnetic form factors. Fig. 5 shows the total longitudinal cross section \u03c3 L (\u03b3 * p \u2192 p\u03c1 0 ) as a function of W for fixed Q 2 . The results of the JML calculation is shown with the dot-dashed curve. The JML model is able to successfully reproduce the cross sections for almost all of our (Q 2 , W ) range. It can also reproduce successfully the main trends of the W , Q 2 and t dependences of the total and differential cross sections of the reactions \u03b3 * p \u2192 p\u03c9, \u03b3 * p \u2192 p\u03c6 and \u03b3 * p \u2192 n\u03c1 + as presented in refs.

            "text": "The formalism of GPDs is valid in the so-called Bjorken regime, i.e. Q 2 , \u03bd \u2192 \u221e with x B = Q 2 2M\u03bd finite. It was proven [9] that the dominant process for exclusive meson electroproduction, in the Bjorken limit, is given by the so-called handbag diagram represented in Fig. 4. The handbag diagram is based on the notion of factorization in leading-order/leading-twist pQCD between a hard scattering process, exactly calculable in pQCD, and a nonperturbative nucleon structure part that is parametrized by the GPDs. For mesons, the factorization of the handbag diagram is only valid for the longitudinal part of the cross section. For electroproduction of \u03c1 0 and \u03c9 we are sensitive to the sum of the quark handbag diagram and the gluon handbag diagram, while for the \u03c1 + and the \u03c6 channels we are sensitive to, respectively, only the quark handbag diagram and the gluon handbag diagram. In the following we discuss the two particular GK [10] and VGG [11] GPD-based calculations that provide quantitative results for the longitudinal part of the exclusive meson cross sections. In Fig. 5, the dashed line shows the results of the GK model, while the thin solid line shows the result of the VGG model. We see that they give a good description of the high and intermediate W region, down to W \u223c 5 GeV. At high W the slow rise of the cross section is due to the gluon and sea contributions, while the valence quarks contribute only at small W . At lower W values, where the new CLAS data lie, both the GK and VGG models fail to reproduce the data. This discrepancy can reach an order of magnitude at the lowest W values. The trend of these particular GPD calculations is to decrease as W decreases, whereas the data increase. The same behavior was observed, in the low W region, for the exclusive electroproduction of the \u03c1 + as one sees in Fig. 6. The results of the calculations of the GK and VGG models are shown, respectively, with the red and the blue curves. An attempt to reconcile the GPD calculation with the low W \u03c1 0 cross sections is presented in ref. [12]. Through a toy-model, t-channel meson exchanges are included in the GPDs and the result of this calculation (actually a fit) is illustrated by the thick blue curve in Fig. 5. Fig. 7 shows the longitudinal cross section of \u03c6 electroproduction compared with the calculation of the GK model. One can see that the model reproduces well the data for all the presented W range: for low W data where the CLAS data lie and for higher W . As mentionned before, for the \u03c6 channel, we have only the contribution of the handbag diagram of gluons and this comparison shows that the GPD approach can work well for gluons.  The references of the presented data can be found in ref. [4]. The black curve is the result of the GK model. that the GPD approach seems to work for gluons and sea quarks and largely fail for valence quarks. Many theorical efforts are now in progress to understand this transition between the small W region and the high W region. For the \u03c9 channel, SCHC was found to be violated by a significant amount, thus preventing a longitudinal/transverse cross section separation. We therefore do not discuss here its comparison with GPD calculations.",
