The study of two-particle correlations allows us to obtain very different constraints compared to the nuclear modification factor. In particular, the correlation of charged hadrons with high energy \u03c0 0 or direct photons is believed to give a measurement of the parton energy loss and insights into the medium-induced modification of the fragmentation process. High energy neutral pions are reconstructed using the ALICE electromagnetic calorimeters EMCal and PHOS, and the charged particles are detected by the main tracking detectors ITS and TPC. In these proceedings, the measurement of neutral mesons at \u221a s =2.76 TeV in pp collisions are presented, as well as the measurements of azimuthal \u03c0 0 -hadron correlations in pp and Pb-Pb collisions at \u221a s NN = 2.76 TeV, and the extracted per-trigger yield modification factor (I AA ). Comparisons with theoretical model calculations are also added.",

Studying several collision systems aims both at probing such a medium and understanding the strong interaction. In heavy-ion collisions, the medium properties and the in-medium modifications can be measured, while pp collisions are used as a reference, as a test of perturbative QCD (pQCD), and as constraints to the parton distribution (PDFs) and the fragmentation (FF) functions. p-A collisions are used to discriminate cold and hot nuclear matter effects but will not be discussed here. The measurement of neutral meson production allows us to obtain a rough approach to parton energy loss through its nuclear modification factor R AA . The study of \u03c0 0 -hadron correlations permits us to obtain other constraints to parton energy loss and is a necessary step to access photon-hadron correlations that provide a calibration of the parton energy scale for energy loss studies.",

The first one consists in combining pairs of clusters to reconstruct the invariant mass of the two decay photons coming from the neutral mesons. The candidates whose invariant mass falls close to the \u03c0 0 or \u03b7 mass are kept and the combinatorial background is treated statistically, as shown in Fig. 1, top panel. The second analysis uses elongated clusters made of the merged electromagnetic showers of both decay photons. The elongation can be quantified by the largest squared eigenvalue \u03c3 2 long (see Fig. 1, bottom panel) of the cluster's energy decomposition in the (pseudorapidity, azimuth) plane of EMCal, which, due to the decay angle variation decreases with increasing meson p T . \u03c0 0 can then be selected with an energy dependent cut on \u03c3 2 long . This method will be referred as \"single cluster analysis\" in the following.",

The cross section for \u03c0 0 results from a combination of PCM, PHOS and EMCal measurements from 2011 [2] and 2013 data while the \u03b7 cross section results from a combination of PCM and EMCal measurements. The new EMCal measurement using the single cluster analysis allows us to extend the p T reach from 20 GeV/c up to 40 GeV/c for \u03c0 0 , and the new measurement allows us to reach a p T up to 20 GeV/c for the \u03b7.   The results, fitted by a two component model, are compared to PYTHIA 8.2 Monash 2013, which agrees better with the data for \u03c0 0 than for the \u03b7. Comparisons with NLO pQCD calculations lead to the same disagreement for the \u03b7 than with the \u03c0 0 [5] when CTEQ PDFs and AES [4] for the fragmentation function are used, but the discrepancy is much reduced for \u03c0 0 when MSTW PDFs with DSS14 [3] for the fragmentation function are used. Combined with the Pb-Pb measurement at \u221a s NN = 2.76 TeV [2], these results will allow us to obtain the nuclear modification factor, R AA , for the \u03b7 meson as well as to extend the \u03c0 0 R AA measurement [6] up to 20 GeV/c. Yet differential measurements such as \u03c0 0 -hadron correlations are also needed to have a better understanding of the in-medium energy loss.",

The dominant systematic uncertainty comes from the background subtraction. On the near side (Fig. 4, left), an enhancement is observed at low p T , maybe due to a modification of the fragmentation function and/or of the quark to gluon jet ratio. Such a behavior could also be caused by a harder parton p T spectrum. On the away side (Fig. 4, right), a suppression attributed to parton energy loss is observed at high p T in Pb-Pb collisions. At low p T , a large enhancement is observed, which was unexpected but could be explained by k T broadening, medium excitation or by the presence of fragments from radiated gluons, all those phenomena being related to the jet interactions with the medium. Both sides show a good agreement with a previous measurement of di-hadron correlations [10]. This suppression at high p T was already observed at RHIC energies [11], but the low p T enhancement is larger in the measurement by ALICE. As the higher harmonics have only been subtracted in the ALICE analysis, results cannot be directly compared.  These results can be compared with theoretical models. On the near side, the enhancement is reproduced only by the AMPT model [12], except below 1 GeV/c where it overestimates the enhancement. On the away side, the high p T suppression is qualitatively described by all the models but only AMPT decribes the low p T enhancement. In this model, the low p T enhancement is a consequence of the increase of soft particles as a result of the interactions between the jet and the QCD medium.",

The medium-induced per-trigger yield modification factor from \u03c0 0 -hadron correlations has also been presented for the most central Pb-Pb events both on the near and away sides. A suppression is observed on the away side which is attributed to parton energy loss and well described by all the models.

A next step is to access the medium induced parton energy loss with direct \u03b3-hadron correlation, for which results from STAR [13] and PHENIX [14] already show a clear evidence of parton energy loss.
