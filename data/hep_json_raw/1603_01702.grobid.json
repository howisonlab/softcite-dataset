The W W production cross section would grow arbitrarily large as a function of the centre-of-mass energy of the production process, \u221a\u015d , were it not for the cancellations of s-and t-channel W + W \u2212 (henceforth denoted W W ) processes. New physics phenomena can occur as deviations from the gauge structure of the Standard Model in the triple-gauge-boson couplings ZW W or \u03b3W W [2], termed anomalous triple-gauge-boson couplings (aTGCs). As the cross section for W W production is one of the largest among those involving a triple-gauge-boson vertex, it allows tests of the self-interaction of the gauge bosons to be made with high precision through measurements of differential kinematic distributions. Studies of the W W production process are particularly important as it constitutes a large irreducible background to searches for physics beyond the SM as well as to resonant H \u2192 W + W \u2212 production.",

Perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD) is the essential ingredient in all these calculations and a recent calculation of non-resonant W W production has been performed up to next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) [3]. However, fixed-order calculations may fail to describe effects that arise from restrictions imposed on the phase space of the measurement. In this analysis, it is required that there be no jets above a certain transverse momentum threshold, which introduces an additional momentum scale in the theoretical calculation. Resumming the resulting large logarithms can improve the accuracy of the prediction. Several calculations including resummation effects up to next-to-next-to-leading logarithms (NNLL) have appeared recently in the literature [4][5][6][7]. Both the fixed-order and resummed predictions are compared to the measurements in this paper, except for ref. [4] which coincides with the central prediction of the NNLO fixed-order prediction.",

The first measurement of the production of W boson pairs at a hadron collider was conducted by the CDF experiment using Tevatron Run I data [9]. Since then, more precise results have been published by the CDF [10] and D\u00d8 experiments [11]. The W W production cross sections have already been measured at the LHC for a centre-of-mass energy of \u221a s = 7 TeV by the ATLAS Collaboration  by the CMS Collaboration [13,14]. Limits on anomalous couplings have been reported in these publications as well and, in several cases, are comparable to the most stringent aTGC limits set by the LEP experiments [8]. The present analysis uses a data sample with an integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb \u22121 at a centre-of-mass energy of \u221a s = 8 TeV. The total and fiducial W W production cross sections are measured using W \u2192 e\u03bd and W \u2192 \u00b5\u03bd decays. Furthermore, measurements of differential cross sections are presented and limits on anomalous triple-gauge-boson couplings are reported.",

Resistive plate and thin-gap chambers are used to trigger on muons in the region |\u03b7| < 2.4. The magnetic fields for the MS are produced by one barrel and two end-cap air-core toroid magnets surrounding the calorimeter. Each magnet consists of eight superconducting coils arranged symmetrically in \u03c6. The ATLAS trigger system uses three consecutive stages to decide whether an event is selected to be read out for permanent storage. The first level of the trigger is implemented using custom-made electronics and operates at a design rate of at most 75 kHz. It is complemented by two software-based high-level triggers (HLT). The second level consists of fast online algorithms to inspect regions of interest flagged by the first trigger level. At the third level, the full event is reconstructed using algorithms similar to those in the offline event selection.",

The qq \u2192 W + W \u2212 events are generated using the Powheg-Box 1.0 generator (referred to as Powheg below) [21][22][23][24]. It is interfaced to Pythia 8.170 for the simulation of parton shower and hadronisation processes. The non-resonant gg-induced W W signal events are generated using the gg2ww program (version 3.1.3) [25] interfaced to Herwig 6.5 and Jimmy 4.31 [26,27] for parton showering, hadronisation and underlying event simulation. The resonant W W production via a Higgs boson with a mass of m H = 125 GeV is modelled using Powheg+Pythia 8.170. For these three samples, the CT10 NLO [28] parton distribution function (PDF) is employed in the event generation. Photos [29] is used to model the radiation of photons, and AU2 [30] and AUET2 [31] are used as the parameter tunes for the underlying event in the Powheg+Pythia and the Herwig+Jimmy samples, respectively. To calculate acceptances (see section 8.2) or make differential predictions for the W W signal process, these samples are combined according to their respective cross sections as listed in table 1. Next-to-leading-order electroweak (EW) contributions of O(\u03b1 3 EW ) are described in refs. [32][33][34][35] and the corrections derived in ref. [36] are applied as scale factors to qq \u2192 W + W \u2212 production in the acceptance calculation and in the setting of limits on anomalous triple-gauge-couplings (see section 10), but not for any other purpose or distribution shown in this paper.",

These object quality criteria vary for the different triggers and are generally looser and more efficient for dilepton triggers as opposed to single-lepton triggers, which are designed to yield larger rate reductions. Another important consideration is the coverage of the first-level muon trigger, which is only about 80% in the central region (|\u03b7| < 1.05) of the detector [53]. In the ee and \u00b5\u00b5 final states, highly efficient dilepton triggers are used, which impose loose identification criteria on both electrons for the dielectron trigger and for the dimuon trigger only a single muon in the first trigger level. In the e\u00b5 final state the optimal signal yield is achieved by combining single-lepton triggers with the e\u00b5 dilepton trigger, as the latter is affected by the limited coverage for muons at the first trigger level and, due also to the trigger requirements on the electrons, yields a low efficiency.",

However, the resulting effect on the MC ratio and consequently on the top-quark background estimate are very small. Interference effects between W t and tt have also been considered and similarly to the variations of the single-top cross section, the impact is found to be minor. An additional cross-check is performed by changing the exponent in the correction factor p data /p MC 2 to be 1.5 or 2.5, which reflects the average jet multiplicity in top-quark background events (see figure 3). The resulting change in the estimated yield of top-quark background is found to be less than 1%. This indicates that the result does not strongly depend on how one assumes the correction factor should account for the two jets in the final state. The value of p data /p MC ranges between 0.982 and 1.009 with an uncertainty of 1.5-5% for the different final states, thus indicating good modelling of top-quark events in MC simulation. The uncertainty on this ratio is propagated to the total uncertainty on the top-quark background estimate. Apart from the MC ratio, further terms play a role in eq.

While the normalisation of the top-quark background is determined from data, the shape information used in the differential measurements relies on MC modelling. The binby-bin uncertainties in the differential distributions are evaluated by propagating (1) the uncertainties of the jet energy scale and resolution, (2) the uncertainties determining by taking the difference in the differential distributions found with different MC generators and parton shower models and (3) the uncertainties due to the QCD scale and parton distribution functions.

The reconstructed spectra are corrected for background contributions and then unfolded to the fiducial phase space by correcting for detector resolution and reconstruction efficiencies. The iterative Bayesian approach [74,75] with three iterations is employed in this analysis. The choice of three iterations is optimised to minimise the statistical uncertainties and the dependence on the prior Monte Carlo distribution in the unfolded spectra. The measured differential cross sections are calculated from the unfolded signal spectra divided by the integrated luminosity and the corresponding bin widths. For the measurement, statistical uncertainties and the same systematic uncertainties as for the fiducial cross-section measurements are considered. In addition, the uncertainty due to the theoretical modelling is evaluated using a data-driven method that was introduced in ref. [76], in which the kinematic distributions of the MC signal events are corrected to match those from data and the uncertainty is considered as the difference between the unfolded data spectra derived with the modified MC distributions and those using the original MC simulation.

The bin-to-bin correlations are preserved for each source of systematic uncertainty and the correlation matrices are made available in the appendix. The systematic uncertainties are treated as fully correlated. This includes the background uncertainties, except the uncertainties due to the limited statistics of the MC simulation and the uncertainties related to the W +jets estimate, specifically the uncertainties on the measured fake lepton efficiencies and the sample dependence, since both these uncertainties have a large statistical component. The background uncertainties are added in quadrature to the statistical and experimental uncertainties to obtain the total uncertainty in each bin. The total uncertainties range from 10% to 30%.

Equal Couplings and HISZ scenarios are shown in figure 15. Finally, the 95% confidencelevel contours for linear combinations of aTGC parameters defined in the effective field theory approach are shown in figure 16. Due to the increased integrated luminosity and the higher centre-of-mass energy, the new limits are more stringent by up to 50% than those previously published by the ATLAS Collaboration using data taken at \u221a s = 7 TeV [12]. The constraints derived in the LEP scenario are similar to the combined results of the LEP experiments and in a few cases the derived limits exceed the bounds placed by LEP. The 95% confidence-level limits on \u2206g Z 1 obtained in this analysis range from \u22120.016 to 0.027 whilst the limits from LEP cover values from \u22120.021 to 0.054.

The measurement is conducted in three dilepton final states (e\u00b5, ee and \u00b5\u00b5) that are all accompanied by missing transverse momentum due to the neutrinos produced in the leptonic W decays. Fiducial and total cross sections are measured and limits on anomalous triple gauge couplings are derived. The uncertainty of the fiducial cross-section measurement is dominated by systematic uncertainties due to reconstruction and background estimation, while the total cross-section uncertainty is subject to significant contributions from the modelling of the extrapolation from the fiducial to the full phase space.",

This is about 1.4 standard deviations higher than the NNLO prediction of 63.2 +1.6 \u22121.4 (scale) \u00b11.2(PDF) pb. The fiducial cross sections for the three final states are about two standard deviations higher than the partial NLO predictions. However, the difference is reduced by taking into account higher-order effects that increase the cross-section prediction by 5-10%. The measured fiducial cross sections are found to be consistent with predictions that include both the NNLO and resummed QCD corrections up to NNLL accuracy. Differential cross sections are measured in the fiducial region using events in the e\u00b5 final state. The shapes of the measured unfolded differential cross section distributions agree with the predictions at the level of 15%, and the discrepancy is mainly caused by the overall normalization offset. Larger deviations at the 20% level are observed in the unfolded distribution of the leading lepton p T for large transverse momenta. All measured cross sections are consistent within 1.5-2 standard deviations with the predictions.",

The data show no indications of anomalous couplings and are fully compatible with the SM, hence limits on these parameters are set. The derived limits are better than expected due to a deficit in data for large momenta of the leading lepton. Due to the increased integrated luminosity and the higher centre-of-mass energy, the limits reported here are more stringent than those previously published by the ATLAS Collaboration using data taken at \u221a s = 7 TeV. They are also competitive with the results obtained at the LEP collider [8]. The limits can also be compared with the limits observed by the CMS experiment [14], which computed limits based on the dilepton invariant mass distribution m , and which also reported better observed limits than expected limits. The confidence interval on C W W W /\u039b 2 and C B /\u039b 2 derived in this analysis are similar, or up to 20-30% more restrictive than those observed by the CMS experiment [14]. The limits derived on C W /\u039b 2 cover a complementary range around zero compared to the bounds by the CMS experiment. ",
