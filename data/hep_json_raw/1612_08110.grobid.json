In the Standard Model the amplitudes of these processes, suppressed compared to the dominant tree b \u2192 c transition governing charmed decays, usually have similar magnitudes and give rise to possibly large violation of the charge-parity (CP ) symmetry. Therefore, charmless decays of B mesons should be sensitive to additional amplitudes from new, heavy particles, contributing to the loop-level transitions [1].",

The phenomenological understanding that has emerged allows predictions to be made for charmless B 0 s decays, as will be illustrated in the following. In the ongoing effort to test these predictions experimentally, the LHCb experiment has recently observed the decay 2 B 0 s \u2192 \u03b7 \u03b7 . The relatively large measured branching fraction B(B 0 s \u2192 \u03b7 \u03b7 ) = (33.1\u00b17.1)\u00d710 \u22126 is consistent with Standard Model expectations [2]. However, the knowledge about charmless hadronic B 0 s decays into light pseudoscalar (P) and vector (V) mesons is still limited. Further measurements will help to better constrain phenomenological models, the uncertainties of which often translate into a major contribution to the theoretical uncertainties in searches for physics beyond the Standard Model.",

            "text": "The decay B 0 s \u2192 \u03b7 \u03c6 proceeds predominantly through b \u2192 sss transitions, as illustrated in figure 1. It is of particular interest in constraining phenomenological models, as predictions for its branching fraction cover a wide range, typically from 0.1 \u00d7 10 \u22126 to 20 \u00d7 10 \u22126 , with large uncertainties that reflect the limited knowledge of form factors, penguin contributions, the \u03c9 \u2212\u03c6 mixing angle, or the s-quark mass. The decay B 0 s \u2192 \u03b7 \u03c6 has been studied in the framework of QCD factorisation [3,4], perturbative QCD [5,6], soft-collinear effective theory (SCET) [7], SU(3) flavour symmetry [8], and factorisation-assisted topological (FAT) amplitude approach [9]. Table 1 presents the available predictions for B(B 0 s \u2192 \u03b7 \u03c6). In QCD factorisation, predictions for B(B 0 s \u2192 \u03b7 \u03c6) are generally small because the spectator quark can become part of either the \u03b7 or the \u03c6 meson (see figure 1), leading to a strong cancellation between the PV and VP amplitudes contributing to the \u03b7 \u03c6 final state [3]. Such cancellation does not occur in the symmetric B 0 s \u2192 \u03b7 \u03b7 (PP) and B 0 s \u2192 \u03c6\u03c6 (VV) decays. However, other values of the form factor for the B 0 s to \u03c6 transitions can lead to enhancements of the branching fraction by more than an order of magnitude [4]. The measurement of B(B 0 s \u2192 \u03b7 \u03c6) is therefore important to improve the knowledge of the B 0 s to \u03c6 form factor and the accuracy of model predictions. The comparison of QCD factorisation [3,4], perturbative QCD [5], and SCET [7] calculations shows that the hierarchy of branching fractions in B 0 s \u2192 \u03b7 \u03c6 and B 0 s \u2192 \u03b7\u03c6 decays is sensitive to the size of the colour-suppressed QCD penguin loop, which is estimated to be large in perturbative QCD [5], and to \"gluonic charming penguins\", which play an important role in SCET calculations [7]. Future measurements of both decay modes will provide useful information on these loop contributions.",

The sample of B + \u2192 \u03b7 K + candidates is modelled using three components: the signal and the two combinatorial backgrounds with and without a true \u03b7 resonance. The yields of all components are free to vary in the fit. The peaking components in the B 0 s , B + and \u03b7 mass spectra are described using Gaussian functions modified with an exponential tail on each side. While all the tail parameters are fixed from simulation, the mean and the widths of the Gaussian functions are free to vary in the fit, but the ratio of the widths of the peaking components in m \u03b7 KK and m \u03b7 K is fixed to the value obtained in simulation and the difference between the B 0 s and B + masses is constrained to the known value [10]. The \u03b7 resonances in the two samples are modelled using a common function, with mean and width free in the fit. The combinatorial components are described with linear functions, with the exception of the random combinations in m \u03b7 K , where a parabolic function is used. To account for correlations between m \u03b7 KK and m \u03c0\u03c0\u03b3 , the B 0 s \u2192 \u03c6\u03c6 component is described with a superposition of two-dimensional Gaussian kernel functions [33] determined from simulation. For all other components, in particular the signal, the correlation is negligible due to the \u03b7 mass constraint applied in the computation of the B-candidate mass. The fit procedure is validated on simulated samples containing the expected proportion of background and signal events, according to various assumptions on B(B 0 s \u2192 \u03b7 \u03c6). In particular, for B(B 0 s \u2192 \u03b7 \u03c6) = 4 \u00d7 10 \u22126 , a statistical significance corresponding to more than 5 standard deviations is observed in 74% of the pseudoexperiments. s \u2192 \u03b7 \u03c6)/N (B + \u2192 \u03b7 K + ) = (\u22122.9 +4.5 \u22123.5 ) \u00d7 10 \u22124 . Sets of pseudoexperiments are used to evaluate possible fit biases. Fits on samples generated from the probability density function (PDF) with parameters obtained from the data are found to be unbiased. The procedure is then repeated using simulated B 0 s \u2192 \u03c6\u03c6 events instead of generating the corresponding background component from the PDF. Biases of \u22121.3 \u00b1 0.3 on the signal yield and of (\u22121.16 \u00b1 0.33) \u00d7 10 \u22124 on the ratio of yields are observed. The results obtained with data are corrected for these biases and systematic uncertainties computed as the quadratic sum of the statistical uncertainty on the bias and half of the bias value are assigned.",

This is the first upper limit set on the B 0 s \u2192 \u03b7 \u03c6 branching fraction. This result favours the lower end of the range of predictions for this branching fraction, pointing to form factors consistent with the light-cone sum-rule calculation used in ref. [4], or with the hypotheses used in refs. [3,5]. Although large theoretical uncertainties make most predictions compatible with the result of this analysis, the central values of the predictions in refs. [6][7][8][9] are significantly larger than the upper limit. These discrepancies should help in constraining the theoretical models used in the prediction of branching fractions and CP asymmetries for B-meson hadronic charmless decays.",
