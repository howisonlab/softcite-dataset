Events with large missing transverse momentum are selected when produced in association with high-momentum jets of which one or more are identified as jets containing b-quarks. Final states with top quarks are selected by requiring a high jet multiplicity and in some cases a single lepton. The data are found to be consistent with the Standard Model expectations and limits are set on the mass scale of effective field theories that describe scalar and tensor interactions between dark matter and Standard Model particles. Limits on the dark-matter-nucleon cross-section for spin-independent and spin-dependent interactions are also provided. These limits are particularly strong for low-mass dark matter. Using a simplified model, constraints are set on the mass of dark matter and of a coloured mediator suitable to explain a possible signal of annihilating dark matter.",

One of the best motivated candidates for a DM particle is a weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) [5]. At the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), one can search for DM particles (\u03c7 ) that are pair produced in pp collisions. These studies are sensitive to low DM masses (m \u03c7 \u2264 10 GeV), and therefore provide information complementary to direct DM searches, which are most sensitive to larger DM masses [6][7][8][9].",

In this model, a new scalar field, \u03c6, mediates the interactions between DM and quarks as shown in Fig. 2. DM is assumed to be a Dirac fermion that couples to right-handed, down-type quarks. The lightest DM particle, which constitutes cosmic DM, preferentially couples to b-quarks. The collider signature of this model is b-quarks produced in association with missing transverse momentum.

Muon candidates are identified from tracks that are well reconstructed inside both the inner detector and the muon spectrometer [36]. To reject cosmic-ray muons, muon candidates are required to be consistent with production at the primary vertex, defined as the vertex with the highest ( p track T ) 2 , where p track T refers to the transverse momentum of each track. Electrons are identified as tracks that are matched to a well-reconstructed cluster in the electromagnetic calorimeter. Electron candidates must satisfy the tight electron shower shape and track selection criteria of Ref. [37]. Both electrons and muons are required to have transverse momenta p T > 20 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.5. Potential ambiguities between overlapping candidate objects are resolved based on their angular separation. If an electron candidate and a jet overlap within R < 0.2, then the object is considered to be an electron and the jet is discarded. If an electron candidate and any jet overlap within 0.2 < R < 0.4, or if an electron candidate and a b-tagged jet overlap within R < 0.2 of each other, then the electron is discarded and the jet is retained.",

The first CR exploits Z +jets events with Z \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 , while the second uses \u03b3 +jets events for which the production at high transverse momentum ( p \u03b3 T > M Z ) mimics that of Z +jets [45]. The \u03b3 +jets control region substantially increases the number of events at large missing transverse momentum. The transverse momentum of the dimuon pair or photon is added vectorially to the E miss T of the event to simulate the Z \u2192 \u03bd\u03bd background. Corrections to compensate for the differences in efficiency and acceptance between the Z (\u03bd\u03bd)+jets and Z (\u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 )+jets or \u03b3 +jets are derived from data using control regions without b-tagged jets before applying any requirements on the missing transverse momentum. Remaining kinematic selections correspond to the ones described in Table 1. A muon control region is chosen because the energy loss of muons in the detector is comparatively small. The systematic uncertainties introduced by this data-driven procedure on the Z (\u03bd\u03bd)+jets background are approximately 10 %, mainly from the flavour composition of background processes, kinematic differences between the control and signal regions and relative normalizations of backgrounds.",

These contributions are estimated from Z ( + \u2212 )+jets and W ( \u03bd)+jets MC samples generated using ALPGEN2.3 [46] with the CTEQ6L1 [47] parton distribution function (PDF) set. The procedure used for the normalization of this sample is described in reference [48]. These samples are generated with up to five light partons (u, d, s) and one c quark or two heavy quarks (c, b) per event. W + b production is highly suppressed and therefore negligible. A control region enriched in W ( \u03bd)+jets events is selected by adding a lepton requirement to the selection and is used to validate the estimate of this background. The purity of W ( \u03bd)+jets in the control region for SR1 (SR2) is 67 % (47 %). After full selection the contribution of b(c)-quarks to the dominant W ( \u03bd)+jets background is approximately 39 % (38 %) for SR1 and 52 % (37 %) for SR2. The systematic uncertainty on this background is approximately 20 %. Finally, the small contribution from tt is estimated using MC samples and validated in data control regions before applying signal selection requirements. The tt process is selected with very high purity Table 2 Expected background and signal yields for m \u03c7 = 10 GeV compared with observed yields in data for the various signal regions.

The effective mass scale, M * , is set to be 100/40/600 GeV for the D1/C1/D9 operators, approximately corresponding to the expected limit.

In SR3, this contribution is estimated from data using a control region not overlapping with SR4 and largely dominated by tt events with one of the two top quarks decaying semileptonically.

Additionally, the event is required to contain exactly one lepton with p e(\u03bc) T > 30 (25) GeV and must fulfill E miss T + m T > 25 (30) GeV for the electron (muon) channel. The potential signal contribution to this selection is less than 0.1 %. The uncertainties are small because the SR3 data control region uses a kinematic region similar to the signal region with the lepton veto and jet multiplicity being the main difference. These effects were studied and considered as systematic uncertainties. Dominant uncertainties are related to jets and the top quark momentum distribution. Corrections to compensate for the differences in efficiency and acceptance between hadronic and semi-leptonic top decays are derived from MC samples generated using the POWHEG BOX generator [49] interfaced with JIMMY4.31 [50] with the nextto-leading-order (NLO) PDF set CT10 [51].

The results for the operators D1, C1, and D9 are presented individually for all four signal regions. The best limits on the D1 and C1 operators are obtained using SR4, while SR1 provides the best limits on the D9 operator, as shown in Fig. 4. These limits are then converted into limits on the \u03c7 -nucleon cross-section [12].

The results reported in this article represent the first ATLAS limits on the scalar operator C1 and they significantly improve the sensitivity to \u03c7 -nucleon interactions mediated by the scalar operator D1 compared to previous ATLAS results [14,16,18,19]. Figure 7 shows the exclusion curves observed and expected for the b-FDM model as a function of the mediator and DM masses. For each point in (m \u03c7 , m \u03c6 ), the signal region with the best expected sensitivity is used, with SR1 dominating over the other signal regions. For a DM particle of approximately 35 GeV, as suggested by the interpretation of data recorded by the Fermi-LAT collaboration, mediator masses between approximately 300 and 500 GeV are excluded at 95 % CL.",

The analysis is performed using 20.3 fb \u22121 of pp collisions collected at \u221a s = 8 TeV by the ATLAS detector at the LHC. The results are interpreted in the framework of an effective field theory to set stringent limits on scalar and tensor interactions between Standard Model and DM particles. The data are found to be consistent with the Standard Model expectations, and limits are set on the mass scale of effective field theories that describe scalar and tensor interactions between DM and Standard Model particles. The exclusion limits are strongest at low DM masses. The limit on the \u03c7 -nucleon cross-section mediated by the D1 operator is improved significantly with respect to previously published ATLAS results by obtaining sensitivities of approximately \u03c3 SI \u03c7 \u2212N = 10 \u221242 cm 2 for m \u03c7 = 10 GeV. Constraints on b-Flavoured Dark Matter models, suitable to explain a possible signal of annihilating DM, are also presented. The excluded regions depend on m \u03c7 and m \u03c6 . For m \u03c7 = 35 GeV, mediator particles with m \u03c6 = 300-500 GeV are excluded. sity of Chicago) for helpful discussions about the models presented and the interplay between collider DM constraints and direct and indirect DM experiments.
