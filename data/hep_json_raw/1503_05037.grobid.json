For this purpose, neutral B 0 q (q = d, s) meson oscillations, mediated by box diagrams, and rare decays, proceeding through loop flavour changing neutral currents, come as natural grounds to seek for any deviation from Standard Model-based predictions. Spectroscopy of heavyflavoured hadrons is also considered along these research lines.",

The detector includes a high precision tracking system, consisting of a silicon-strip vertex detector surrounding the pp interaction region, a largearea silicon-strip detector located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4 Tm, and three stations of silicon-strip detectors and straw drift tubes placed downstream. The combined tracking system has momentum resolution \u0394p/p that varies from 0.4% at 5 GeV/c to 0.6% at 100 GeV/c, and impact parameter (IP) resolution of 20 \u03bcm for tracks with high transverse momentum. Charged hadrons are identified using two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors (RICH) [2]. Photon, electron and hadron candidates are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter and a hadronic calorimeter. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers. The trigger [3] consists of a hardware stage, based on information from the calorimeter and muon systems, followed by a software stage which applies a full event reconstruction. Events triggered both on objects independent of the signal, and associated with the signal, are used. In the latter case, the transverse energy of the hadronic cluster is required to be at least 3.5 GeV. The software trigger includes more sophisticated requirements and operations, in particular a multivariate algorithm to identify secondary vertices [4].",

Their interesting feature lies in the possibility to study the dynamics of the amplitude, as the density of events in the Dalitz plane [32] is directly proportional to the squared modulus of the amplitude A. Near-threshold distributions are observed for both mesonic and baryonic cases. However, while in the mesonic modes [33], resonances such as \u03c1, f 0 (980) or K * largely contribute to the spectrum, the baryonic decays [34] exhibit a non-resonant near-pp threshold enhancement.

A huge number of observations of new particles, excited states and decays has been published. The observation of the rare B 0 s \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 decay is also one of the main achievements. Hints of discrepancies in observables of the rare B decays have been remarked but are still lacking significance. CP violation studies in multibody decays have unveiled complex final state dynamics that still needs to be understood in amplitude analyses.

Finally, charmless b quark decays to u, s, d, leading to final states with one charm D meson, are suppressed, and the bc annihilation process, generating final states with no charmed hadron, is even more suppressed.
