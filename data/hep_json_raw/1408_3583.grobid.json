The data were collected by the CMS detector in proton-proton collisions at the LHC and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb \u22121 at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV . The number of observed events is found to be consistent with the standard model prediction. Limits are placed on the DM-nucleon scattering cross section as a function of the DM particle mass for spin-dependent and spinindependent interactions. Limits are also placed on the scale parameter M D in the Arkani-Hamed, Dimopoulos, and Dvali (ADD) model of large extra dimensions, and on the unparticle model parameter U . The constraints on ADD models and unparticles are the most stringent limits in this channel and those on the DM-nucleon scattering cross section are an improvement over previous collider results.",

Popular models of particle dark matter hypothesize the existence of nonrelativistic particles that interact weakly with the standard * e-mail: cms-publication-committee-chair@cern.ch model (SM) particles. These are known as weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs). Such models are consistent with the thermal relic abundance for dark matter [3,4] if the WIMPs have weak-scale masses and if their interaction cross section with baryonic matter is of the order of electroweak cross sections. Some new physics scenarios postulated to explain the hierarchy problem also predict the existence of WIMPs [5].",

We can thus assume the interaction to be a contact interaction and work within the framework of an effective field theory.

The results are not expected to be greatly altered if the DM particle is a Majorana fermion, except that certain interactions are not allowed. Results from previous searches in the monojet channel have been used to set limits on the DM-nucleon scattering cross section as a function of the DM mass [10][11][12]. The Arkani-Hamed, Dimopoulos, and Dvali (ADD) model [13][14][15][16][17] of large extra dimensions mitigates the hierarchy problem [18] by introducing a number \u03b4 of extra dimensions. In the simplest scenario, these are compactified over a multidimensional torus with radii R. Gravity is free to propagate into the extra dimensions, while SM particles and interactions are confined to ordinary space-time. The strength of the gravitational force is thus diluted in 3+1 dimensional spacetime, explaining its apparent weakness in comparison to the other fundamental forces. The fundamental Planck scale in 3+\u03b4 spatial dimensions, M D , is related to the apparent Planck scale in 3 dimensions, M Pl as M Pl",

This algorithm reconstructs each particle produced in a collision by combining information from the tracker, the calorimeters, and the muon system, and identifies them as either a charged hadron, neutral hadron, photon, muon, or electron. The candidate particles are then clustered into jets using the anti-k T algorithm [30] with a distance parameter of 0.5. The energy resolution for jets is 15 % at p T of 10 GeV, 8 % at p T of 100 GeV, and 4 % at p T of 1 TeV [31]. Corrections are applied to the jet four-momenta as a function of the jet p T and \u03b7 to account for residual effects of non-uniform detector response [32]. Contributions from multiple proton-proton collisions overlapping with the event of interest (pileup) are mitigated by discarding charged particles not associated with the primary vertex and accounting for the effects from neutral particles [33]. The E miss T in this analysis is defined as the magnitude of the vector sum of the transverse momenta of all particles reconstructed in the event, excluding muons.",

            "text": "Events are collected using two triggers, the first of which has an E miss T threshold of 120 GeV, where the E miss T is calculated using calorimeter information only. The second trigger requires a particle-flow jet with p T > 80 GeV and E miss T > 105 GeV, where the E miss T is reconstructed using the particle-flow algorithm and excludes muons. This definition of E miss T allows the control sample of Z \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc events used for estimating the Z \u2192 \u03bd\u03bd background to be collected from the same trigger as the signal sample. The trigger efficiencies are measured to be nearly 100 % for all signal regions. Events are required to have a well-reconstructed primary vertex [34], which is defined as the one with the largest sum of p 2 T of all the associated tracks, and is assumed to correspond to the hard scattering process. Instrumental and beam-related backgrounds are suppressed by rejecting events where less than 20 % of the energy of the highest p T jet is carried by charged hadrons, or more than 7 % of this energy is carried by either neutral hadrons or photons. This is very effective in rejecting non-collision backgrounds, which are found to be negligible. The jet with the highest transverse momentum ( j 1 ) is required to have p T > 110 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.4. As signal events typically contain jets from initial state radiation, a second jet ( j 2 ) with p T above 30 GeV and |\u03b7| < 4.5 is allowed, provided the second jet is separated from the first in azimuth (\u03c6) by less than 2.5 radians, \u03c6(j 1 , j 2 ) < 2.5. This angular requirement suppresses Quantum ChromoDynamics (QCD) dijet events. Events with more than two jets with p T > 30 GeV and |\u03b7| < 4.5 are discarded, thereby significantly reducing background from top-quark pair tt and QCD multijet events. Processes producing leptons, such as W and Z production, dibosons, and top-quark decays, are suppressed by rejecting events with well reconstructed and isolated electrons with p T > 10 GeV, reconstructed muons [35] with p T > 10 GeV and well-identified [36] hadronically decaying tau leptons with p T > 20 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.3. Electrons and muons are considered isolated if the scalar sum of the p T of the charged hadrons, neutral hadrons and photon contributions computed in a cone of radius ( \u03b7) 2 + ( \u03c6) 2 = 0.4 about the lepton direction, divided by the electron or muon p T , is less than 0.2. The analysis is performed in seven inclusive regions of E miss T : E miss T > 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500, 550 GeV.",

            "text": "After the full event selection, there are two dominant backgrounds: Z + jets events with the Z boson decaying into a pair of neutrinos, denoted Z(\u03bd\u03bd); and W + jets with the W boson decaying leptonically, denoted W( \u03bd) (where stands for a charged lepton, and can be replaced by e, \u03bc or \u03c4 to denote specific decays to electron, muon, or tau, respectively). Other background processes include: tt production; single top quark, denoted (tt); QCD multijet; diboson processes, including ZZ, WZ, and WW; and Z + jets events with the Z boson decaying to charged leptons, denoted Z( ). Together, these other background processes constitute \u22484 % of the total. The dominant backgrounds are estimated from data, as described in detail below, whilst others are taken from simulation, and cross-checked with data. Figure 3 shows the E miss T distribution of the data and of the expected background, after imposing all the selections described in Sect. 3 and normalised to the estimation from data using the E miss T threshold of 500 GeV. The background from events containing Z(\u03bd\u03bd) decays is estimated from a control data sample of Z(\u03bc\u03bc) events, since the kinematic features of the two processes are similar. The control sample is selected by applying the full signal selection, except for the muon veto, and in addition requiring two reconstructed muons with p T > 20 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.4, with at least one muon also passing the isolation requirement. The reconstructed invariant mass is required to be between 60 and 120 GeV. The distribution of Z(\u03bd\u03bd) events is estimated from the observed dimuon control sample after correcting for the following: the estimated background in the dimuon sample; differences in muon acceptance and efficiency with respect to neutrinos; and the ratio of branching fractions for the Z decay to a pair of neutrinos, and to a pair of muons (R BF ). The acceptance estimate is taken from the fraction of simulated events that pass all signal selection requirements (except muon veto), having two generated muons with p T > 20 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.4 and an invariant mass within the Z-boson mass window of 60-120 GeV. The efficiency of the selection, which has the additional requirement that there be at least one isolated muon in the event, is also estimated from simulation. It is corrected to account for differences in the measured muon reconstruction efficiencies in data and simulation. The uncertainty in the Z(\u03bd\u03bd) prediction includes both statistical and systematic components. The sources of uncertainty are: (1) the statistical uncertainty in the numbers of Z(\u03bc\u03bc) events in the data, (2) uncertainty due to backgrounds contributing to the control sample, (3) uncertainties in the acceptance due to the size of the simulation samples and from PDFs evaluated based on the PDF4LHC [50,51] recommendations, (4) the uncertainty in the selection efficiency as determined from the difference in measured efficiencies in data and simulation and the size of the simulation samples, and (5) the theoretical uncertainty on the ratio of branching fractions [52]. The backgrounds to the Z(\u03bc\u03bc) control sample contribute at the level of 3-5 % across the E miss T signal regions and are predominantly from diboson and tt processes. These are taken from simulation and a 50 % uncertainty is assigned to them. The dominant source of uncertainty in the high E miss T regions is the statistical uncertainty in the number of Z(\u03bc\u03bc) events, which is 11 % for E miss T > 500 GeV. Table 1 summarizes the statistical and systematic uncertainties.",

Uncertainties in the signal acceptance (described below) are taken into account when upper limits on the cross section are determined.

The mass of the mediator is varied for two fixed values of the mass of the DM particle, 50 and 500 GeV. The width of the mediator is varied between the extremes of M/8\u03c0 and M/3, where M/8\u03c0 corresponds to a mediator that can annihilate into only one quark flavor and helicity, has couplings g \u03c7 g q = 1 and is regarded as a lower limit on the mediator width. However, not all widths may be physically realizable for the DM couplings that are considered [62].

Figure 7 shows 95 % CL limits at LO, compared to published results from ATLAS, LEP, and the Tevatron. The ATLAS limits were produced using the full kinematic phase space, without any truncation applied to restrict the phase space to the region where the effective field theory is valid. The CMS limits are obtained using the truncated phase space, after discarding events for which the parton center of mass energy\u015d > M D 2 . The maximum difference in the cross section evaluated with and without the truncation was found to be 11 %. Table 7 shows the expected and observed limits at LO and NLO for the ADD model.

The dominant backgrounds to this topology are from Z(\u03bd\u03bd) + jets and W( \u03bd) + jets events, and are estimated from data samples of Z(\u03bc\u03bc) and W(\u03bc\u03bd) events, respectively. The data are found to be in agreement with expected contributions from standard model processes. Limits are set on the DM-nucleon scattering cross section assuming vector, axialvector, and scalar operators. Limits are also set on the fundamental Planck scale M D in the ADD model of large extra dimensions and on the unparticle model parameter U . Compared to previous CMS publications in this channel, the lower limits on M D represent an approximately 40 % improvement, and the lower limits on the unparticle model parameter U represent an improvement by a factor of roughly 3. The upper limit on the DM-nucleon cross section has been reduced from 8.79 \u00d7 10 \u221241 to 2.70 \u00d7 10 \u221241 cm 2 for the axial-vector operator and from 2.47 \u00d7 10 \u221239 to 7.06 \u00d7 10 \u221240 cm 2 for the vector operator for a particle DM mass of 10 GeV. The constraints on ADD models and unparticles are the most stringent limits in this channel and those on the DM-nucleon scattering cross section are an improvement over previous collider results.",
