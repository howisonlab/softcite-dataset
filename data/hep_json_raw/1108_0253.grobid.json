Isolated photons are considered: from a theoretical perspective, photons are isolated if the transverse energy E iso T , within a cone of radius R = ( \u03b7) 2 + ( \u03c6) 2 = 0.4 centered around the photon direction in the pseudorapidity (\u03b7) and azimuthal angle (\u03c6) plane, 2 is smaller than E cut T . In Jetphox [9], used for next-to-leading order (NLO) calculations, E iso T is calculated from all partons. Similarly, a corresponding isolation prescription is applied experimentally on the reconstructed objects, based on the energy reconstructed in an R = 0.4 cone around the photon candidate, corrected for the effects associated with: the energy of the photon candidate itself, the underlying event and the collision pileup [3]. The main background to these isolated prompt photons is composed of photons from decays of light neutral mesons, such as the \u03c0 0 or \u03b7.",

For energies above 200 GeV the global constant term c, estimated to be (1.2 \u00b1 0.6)% ((1.8 \u00b1 0.6)%) in the barrel (endcap) for the 2010 data, starts to dominate [11]. In front of the electromagnetic calorimeter the inner detector allows the reconstruction of tracks from the primary pp collision point and also from secondary vertices, permitting an efficient reconstruction of photon conversions in the beam pipe and inner detector up to a radius of \u223c80 cm. Further details of the inner detector, the electromagnetic calorimeter and the whole ATLAS detector are documented in Ref. [12]. Event samples simulated with Pythia 6.4.21 [13] are used to study the characteristics of signal and background events. To estimate systematic uncertainties related to the choice of the event generator and the parton shower model, alternative samples are generated with Herwig 6.5 [14]. Events used in this analysis are triggered using a single-photon trigger with a nominal transverse energy threshold of 40 GeV. The trigger efficiency, \u03b5 trig , is measured using a bootstrap method to be (99.4 +0.6 \u22120.2 )% for prompt photon candidates with E T > 45 GeV passing the selection criteria presented below. The same trigger condition was used for the whole dataset, even though the mean number of events per collision rose from <1 to \u223c3 as the instantaneous luminosity increased during 2010. Collision candidates are selected by requiring a primary vertex with at least three associated charged particle tracks, consistent with the beam interaction region. The total number of selected events in data after these requirements is almost 1.7 million, with a negligible amount of non-collision background.",

An event-by-event correction [16,17] is applied to subtract the estimated contributions from the underlying event and in-time pileup (i.e. from additional proton-proton interactions). The correction to E iso T is typically 900 MeV. After this subtraction, the remaining fluctuations are dominated by electronic noise from the calorimeter measurement. The effect of the out-of-time pileup, associated with collisions taking place in previous bunch-crossings, is found to be minimal (i.e. shifts of 200 MeV at most, towards lower isolation energies).

This definition is similar to applying a 4 GeV cut on the particle-level isolation, defined as the transverse energy of all stable particles in a cone of radius R = 0.4 around the photon direction (with the underlying event removed as before). The small difference between the two, caused by noise and other detector effects, is taken into account in the uncertainties associated with the photon reconstruction efficiency \u03b5 reco discussed below. The particle-level isolation can in turn be related to the parton-level isolation in Jetphox that is used for the NLO predictions. The efficiency of the isolation criteria is found to be similar (i.e. within a few percent) at both the particle-level and the parton-level for simulated photons passing the selection described below. As in Ref. [3], the reconstruction and preselection efficiency \u03b5 reco is computed from simulated prompt photons as a function of the true photon E T . It is defined as the ratio between the number of photons reconstructed in a given |\u03b7| interval with reconstructed E iso T < 3 GeV, and the total number of true prompt photons with true pseudorapidity in the same |\u03b7| interval, and with particlelevel transverse isolation energy <4 GeV. The estimated \u03b5 reco for photons with 45 < E T < 400 GeV is \u223c85% (75%) in the barrel (endcap) region. The main inefficiency (\u223c10%) is due to the acceptance loss originating from a few inoperative optical links in the calorimeter readout. A similar reduction is caused by the isolation requirement in the pseudorapidity region 1.52 |\u03b7| < 1.81 where the calorimetric isolation suffers from larger detector effects. The systematic uncertainty on \u03b5 reco associated with the experimental isolation requirement is evaluated from the prompt photon simulation by varying the value of the isolation criterion by the average difference (\u223c500 MeV) observed for electrons from W \u2192 e\u03bd events in data and simulation. The estimated uncertainty varies between 3 and 4% depending on \u03b7. The uncertainty associated with the imperfect knowledge of the material in front of the ECAL is estimated by comparing the expected efficiencies in a sample simulated with the nominal ATLAS setup, and one with increased material. It varies between 1 and 2.5%, depending on \u03b7.",

As detailed in Ref. [3], selection criteria on these variables, optimized independently for unconverted and converted photons, are applied to reconstructed photon candidates. The requirements on these variables are applied in stages resulting in tight candidates: firstly jets are removed whilst still keeping a high photon efficiency and then secondly wide or closely spaced showers (i.e. those consistent with jets or meson decays) are rejected. The selection criteria have been revised to minimize the systematics on the efficiency extraction, especially in the region 1.81 |\u03b7| < 2.37. The photon identification efficiency \u03b5 ID is computed from simulation as a function of transverse energy in each pseudorapidity region. It is defined as the efficiency for reconstructed (true) prompt photons, with measured E iso T < 3 GeV, to pass the identification criteria mentioned above.",

This helps to reduce the systematic uncertainties associated with the correction procedure. The value of \u03b5 ID varies from 90 to 97%, depending on \u03b7 and increasing with E T . The systematic uncertainty on \u03b5 ID is also \u03b7 dependent, ranging from 1.5 to 3%, with contributions from: detector simulation; background contamination; (un)converted photon misclassification; direct/fragmentation photon fraction; the choice of different Monte Carlo generators (MC). These uncertainties affect the reconstruction and identification efficiencies in a correlated way, and are treated as such in their combination.

The two dimensions are the transverse isolation energy E iso T and the quality of the photon, defined by whether or not it passes the shower shape identification criteria. On the isolation axis, the signal region contains photon candidates with E iso T < 3 GeV, while the sideband region contains nonisolated photon candidates with E iso T > 5 GeV. On the other axis, the signal photon candidates are required to pass the tight identification criteria (tight candidates). Those failing the tight criteria but passing a background-enriching subset of these criteria (non-tight candidates) are contained in the sideband. A typical distribution of E iso T for both tight and non-tight data is shown in Fig. 1 for photon candidates with 45 < E T < 55 GeV in |\u03b7| < 0.6. The non-tight distribution is normalized to the tight one above 5 GeV where a only small signal contamination is expected. Corrections for the signal contamination in the background control regions are computed using prompt photon Monte Carlo samples. For the tight isolated signal leaking into the non-isolated region, these are as large as 17% at high E T . Smaller leakages of up to 6% are expected for the other two background control regions. The purity of isolated prompt photons measured with this method increases with E T from 91% at E T = 45 GeV to close to 100% at E T > 200 GeV.",

They are presented as a function of the photon transverse energy, for each of the four considered pseudorapidity intervals. They are also presented in tabular form in Appendix A. The error bars on the data points represent the combination of the statistical and systematic uncertainties: systematic uncertainties dominate over the entire kinematic range considered. The contribution from the luminosity uncertainty (3.4%) is shown separately as it represents a possible global change by a common multiplicative factor. The data agree with NLO pQCD calculations, obtained with Jetphox 1.2.2 [9] using the CTEQ 6.6 PDFs [20] and the BFG set II [21] fragmentation functions (FF). These predictions are negligibly affected when using BFG set I instead. The nominal renormalization, factorization and fragmentation scales are set to the E T of the photon. Theoretical calculations using MSTW 2008 [22] and NNPDF2.0 [23] PDFs show a similarly good agreement to data. The central values obtained with the MSTW 2008 (NNPDF2.0) PDFs are 3 to 5% (1 to 4%) higher than those predicted using the CTEQ 6.6 PDFs. The total systematic uncertainties on the theoretical predictions are represented with a solid band. The scale uncertainty (\u223c10%) is the leading theoretical systematic uncertainty. It is estimated from the enve- lope of independent and coherent variations of the three scales, by a factor of two around the central value, with the renormalization scale (coherent variation) dominating this envelope at low (high) E T , while the fragmentation scale produces the smallest variation. The scale error is summed in quadrature with the contributions from the PDF uncertainty (5% at 68% C.L.) and the uncertainty associated with the choice of the parton-level isolation criterion (2%). The same quantities are also shown in the bottom panels after having been normalized to the expected NLO pQCD cross-sections.",

In general, good agreement between the data and the NLO pQCD predictions is observed. This measurement improves the precision and significantly extends the kinematic regime explored in the previous measurement [3] and is consistent in the region where the two measurements overlap. Over most of this extended kinematic range the experimental errors are smaller than the theoretical ones. The large theoretical scale error limits the discrimination between PDFs. Future measurements of this process in finer pseudorapidity binning and those of the photon + jet system should provide more insight into the PDF differences.
