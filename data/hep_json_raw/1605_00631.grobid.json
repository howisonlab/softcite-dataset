Nevertheless, the neutrino flavor oscillation experiments unambiguously demonstrated that neutrino has a non-zero mass. The success of neutrino oscillation experiments notwithstanding, they are only sensitive to the mass squared differences, so we still do not know the absolute mass scale of neutrino. It is also not known how the three mass eigenstates are aligned with respect to each other -the question of normal versus inverse hierarchy. Essentially, this question is whether the lightest neutrino mass state is dominated by electron neutrino flavor (normal), or by muon and tau neutrino flavors (inverted). Finally, it is not clear how exactly the mass term should be incorporated into the theory. Strongly linked to the last question is the possibility that neutrino is its own antiparticle, which would make it the only known Majorona fermion.",

Such a process would violate the lepton number conservation and B-L conservation, and is forbidden in the Standard Model. Among several possible mechanisms the simplest and most often considered one is the 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay mediated by a light Majorana neutrino with the emission of two electrons only. Another mode of this process that also often receives experimental attention is the 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay with an additional emission of one or two hypothetical bosons, called Majorons. Other potential mechanisms include exchanges by heavy Majorana neutrino and by sterile neutrino. Regardless of the mechanism, the existence of 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay would prove that neutrino Majorana mass is non-vanishing. 1 However, the relative contribution of the Majorana term to the total neutrino mass may still be negligible, as discussed in. 2 In the simplest case of the exchange by a light Majorona neutrino, the half-life of 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay depends on the effective Majorona mass as follows:",

This would likely involve observation in multiple isotopes or tracking of the full kinematics. The process of light-neutrino exchange would still have to contribute though, and assuming that non-observation implies a limit on the mass the electron-neutrino can have were it a Majorana particle is still considered safe. Another problem of measuring the neutrino mass using this approach is the large theoretical uncertainties on the nuclear matrix elements (NME). Several approximations are used to calculate the NME resulting in differences by a factor of \u223c2-4, depending on the isotope (see Fig.5 in 5 ).",

            "text": "In spite of the lower resolution and absence of event topology information the experiment currently has the largest amount of isotope of interest (\u223c320 kg of enr.Xe initially, increased to \u223c390 kg in 2013) and uniquely large and pure shield of external backgrounds (main KamLAND detector) that provides both passive and active rejection. Initial result was published in 2012 15 based on 27.4 kg\u2022yr exposure (77.6 days with 129 kg of 136 Xe fiducial) and revealed substantial peak in the ROI. The energy of the peak was 3% larger than the Q-value of 136 Xe \u03b2\u03b2 decay, excluding the 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay explanation at more than 5\u03c3 and thus suggesting a presence of an unexpected background. The background was identified as 110m Ag, whose presence may be explained by the spallation of 136 Xe by cosmic rays (Xe gas was enriched in Russia and sent to Japan by airplane), or by fallout from the Fukushima I reactor accident on March 11, 2011 (it was observed with Ge detectors in the soil sample in Sendai). 16 The binned maximum likelihood fit was performed on the data, allowing 110m Ag and other potential unexpected backgrounds to float unconstrained. The resulting 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 half-life limit was T 1/2 >5.7\u202210 24 yr at 90% C.L. The combined best-fit background rate, dominated by 110m Ag, was reported in 800 keV ROI (2200-3000 keV) as 0.22 ROI \u22121 (Xe-LS tonne) \u22121 day \u22121 , which we translate using 2.44 wt.% loading into \u223c3000 ROI \u22121 tonne \u22121 yr \u22121 for exposure with enriched xenon. The first attempt to remove the background was performed in February 2012 by passing the Xe-LS through a filter. The subsequent data taking showed reduction of 110m Ag consistent with natural decay of the isotope, indicating that the Xe-LS filtration had not effect. The combined analysis of the datasets before and after the filtration spanned the period from October 2011 to June 2012 (Phase I), corresponding to 89.5 kg\u2022yr exposure (112.3 days with 179 kg of 136 Xe before and 101.1 days with 125 kg after the filtration). The 90% C.L. lower limit of T 1/2 >1.9\u202210 25 yr was reported. 17 The second attempt to remove 110m Ag background started in June 2012 when Xe was extracted from the detector and purified. 110m Ag was confirmed to remain in the depleted LS, which was then also purified. The purification eventually reduced 110m Ag background by more than a factor of 10. Apart from sub-dominant remaining contamination with 110m Ag, the primary backgrounds for KamLAND-Zen are 214 Bi on the IB film (possibly due to dust contamination during IB film assembly and air leakage during the LS purification), 10 C muon spallation product, and 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay. The Phase II dataset was collected between December 2013 and October 2015. The result features increased Xe concentration up to \u223c2.9 wt.% for a total Phase-II exposure of 504 kg\u2022yr (534.5 days with \u223c345 kg of 136 Xe), reduction of 10 C background by additional cuts on muon-induced neutron events, and mitigation of the 214 Bi on IB by optimizing fiducial volume cut and addition of volume as an observable in the fit. The energy resolution increased to \u223c11% FWHM due to increased number of dead PMTs, compared to Phase I. The Phase II dataset is further divided into two equal periods (Period-1 and Period-2) roughly equal to one lifetime of 110m Ag each. The fit is simultaneous in energy and volume (with 20 equal volume bins) and is performed independently for the two time periods. The best-fit background index in 400 keV ROI (2300-2700 keV) for the cleanest part of the dataset (Phase II, Period-2, 1-m radius spherical volume) translates to \u223c160 ROI \u22121 tonne \u22121 yr \u22121 for exposure with enriched xenon. The Phase II result is T 1/2 >9.6\u202210 25 yr at 90% C.L. Combining Phase I and Phase II data gives a 90% C.L. lower limit of T 1/2 >1.1\u202210 26 yr at 90% C.L.. 18 This result solidifies the KamLAND-Zen's lead among current generation experiments. KamLAND-Zen's plan for Phase III is to rebuild the IB with cleaner material, increase xenon amount to \u223c800 kg, refurbish water-Cerenkov veto detector. The projected sensitivity for Phase III is T 1/2 >2\u202210 26 yr after two years of data taking. 19 KamLAND-Zen also reported on searches for various Majoron-emitting modes of 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay using 38.6 kg\u2022yr 20 and on 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decays to the excited states using 89.5 kg\u2022yr 21 exposures. A lower limit on the ordinary (spectral index n = 1) Majoron-emitting decay half-life of 136 Xe was obtained as T 1/2 >2.6\u202210 24 yr at 90% C.L. The corresponding limit on the Majoron-neutrino coupling constant was reported as | g M ee | < (0.8 \u2212 1.6) \u2022 10 \u22125 . The authors of this manuscript, however, believe that the coupling constraint should be a factor of two stronger, due to the improved understanding of the phase space factor value for the n=1 Majoron decay. 14  ",

The advantage of this technology is that it provides the best energy resolution of any detector practical for use in rare events searches. However, one of the major drawbacks is the difficulty of the enrichment, as germanium is a solid at room temperature (whereas xenon is a gas and tellurium experiments don't need to enrich). Growing the crystals and the complicated process of purifying germanium combine to make the technique difficult to scale in mass. With that said, germanium based experiments have found several techniques to achieve very-low backgrounds and remain competitive.",

            "text": "Phase I of GERDA uses reprocessed p-type coaxial detectors that were formerly owned by Heidelberg-Moscow (HDM) and the International Germanium Experiment (IGEX). The total mass of the eight reprocessed detectors (5 from HDM, 3 from IGEX) in Phase I is 17.67 kg enriched to \u223c86% in 76 Ge. These detectors achieve an interpolated FWHM energy resolution of between 0.20% and 0.28% (4.2 and 5.7 keV) at Q-value. The detectors operate at the Italian INFN Laboratori Nationali del Gran Sasso (LNGS). The experiment is shielded by 3 m of water instrumented with PMTs to act as a muon-veto and a liquid argon (LAr) shield. The LAr shield also offers cooling but comes with a drawback that 42 Ar which decays within the LAr becomes 42 K. These 42 K daughters are often charged and thus drift toward the detectors, leading to a background from the 42 K decay on the detector surface. However, in Phase II of the experiment this background will be greatly reduced. The detectors are held by low-mass copper supports in strings. They have demonstrated in an ex situ test that that 42 K background can be eliminated by an external shroud around the detector. In Phase-II, they will use a shroud made from low-background nylon. A pulse-shape discrimination (PSD) based on an artificial neural network rejects multiple scatter events (45% of the background) with a signal acceptance of 0.90 +0.05 \u22120.09 . For Phase II, GERDA is planning to use broad energy germanium (BEGe) detectors manufactured by Canberra. 23 BEGe detectors are not coaxial and instead use a point contact to reduce capacitance and gain greater multiple scatter rejection. The BEGe detectors show an improved FWHM energy resolution of between 0.13% and 0.2% at Q-value (30-40 rel.% better than p-type coaxial detectors) and simpler PSD using an amplitude (A) over energy (E) cut. The A/E cut in BEGe detectors rejects 80% of the background while keeping a fraction 0.92 \u00b1 0.02 of the signal.",

All events in \u00b120 keV window around Q-value were blinded until all cuts and analysis were finalized. A total of 21.6 kg\u2022yr of data are collected with three events in \u00b15 keV of Q-value passing all cuts, placing a 90% C.L. limit of T 1/2 >2.1\u202210 25 yr at 90% C.L. Combining this result with previous results in germanium yields a limit of T 1/2 >3.0\u202210 25 yr at 90% C.L., inconsistent with the claimed discovery by part of HDM. The observed background was found to be consistent within errors with prediction, 25 which has flat energy spectrum around Q-value and BI for 5 keV (\u223cFWHM) wide ROI, normalized to exposure with enr.Ge, of \u223c50 ROI \u22121 tonne \u22121 yr \u22121 after PSD cuts (based on rate per keV quoted in 24 ).

In the future GERDA intends to integrate a total of 20 kg of BEGe detectors which will be closely packed to increase vetoing power of multiple scatter events. Furthermore, the LAr shield is being instrumented as an active veto. In one test facility a rejection of 99.9% of all 42 K backgrounds events has been demonstrated.

The first stage is a single tower referred to as COURE-0, which collected data from March 2013 to August 2013 and November 2013 until March 2015. Each crystal is cooled down to \u223c10 mK and uses a neutron-transmutation-doped Ge thermistor to measure small changes in temperature. When an ionizing particle interacts in a given crystal, that creates a pulse of heat which is detected by the thermistor. This technique has several distinct advantages. First, the isotope of interest, 130 Te, has a natural abundance of \u223c34% meaning that isotopic enrichment is unnecessary. Second, the energy resolution achievable with this technology is similar to germanium detectors, \u223c5.1 keV FWHM at Q-value. However the need to run at 10's of mK adds cost to the experiment per unit size. Also the events last for on the order of seconds, so event pile-up can be a concern. But most seriously, because there is a limit to how large the crystals can be, there are risks of backgrounds from surface contamination. Part of the purpose of COURE-0 was to demonstrate the ability to sufficiently reduce these backgrounds from surface events. A rigorous program for growth of radiopure crystals and surface cleaning has been developed to address backgrounds. 27 The cryogenic systems, shielding, and electronics are all reused from the predecessor experiment, Couricino. [28][29][30] The experiment is shielded by Roman lead inside the cryostat. As compared to Couricino, the amount of copper per unit TeO 2 has been largely reduced to mitigate 232 Th backgrounds. Overall, BI has been substantially reduced compared to Couricino (see Table 4 in 30 ).",

A random fraction of 1-3% of the events within \u00b110 keV of Q-value and events within \u00b110 keV of the 2.615 MeV line of 208 Tl are switched. The fractions varies run-to-run, and creates a peak at Q-value. The analysis exploits both optimal filtering and decouple optimal filtering to separate signal from noise in measuring pulse amplitude. There are also two methods of gain stabilization, based either on the heater data or calibration data. For each crystal-dataset, the combination of filtering and gain stabilization that optimizes energy resolution is utilized. This does vary dataset-to-dataset. Backgrounds are further reduced in the analysis based on six pulse shape parameters. 50% of the data is randomly selected, excluding the ROI, and prominent peaks from the background are used to tune cuts to maximize the ratio of the signal to the square root of the background. The overall efficiency is (81.3 \u00b1 0.6)%. There are some uncertainties in the calibrated energy scale observed for different peaks. Using the sum peak at 2505.7 keV from 60 Co, a shift in the measured energy of 1.9 keV was observed (so that the reconstructed energy of the peak was 2507.6 keV). This is due to a difference in detector response between two-gamma events and single gamma events which is still under investigation. As a result, an uncertainty in the reconstructed Q-value is taken based on residuals at prominent peaks in the background spectrum.",

            "text": "NEXT (\"Neutrino Experiment with a Xenon TPC\") is planning to use highpressure xenon gas (gXe) TPC with electroluminescent (EL) readout to achieve background rejection substantially better than other xenon detectors. At 15 bar pressure, a \u03b2\u03b2 decay typically leaves a \u223c15 cm length track in gXe (compared to \u223c2 mm in LXe). A characteristic increase of ionization density at both ends of the track -two \"blobs\" -can be used to effectively reject the two major backgrounds, 208 Tl ( 232 Th chain) and 214 Bi ( 238 U chain), whose tracks should typically have just one blob due to a single electron. This should in principle allow to identify background (signal) events virtually indistinguishable from signal (background) in a conventional LXe detector -the \u223c3% of \u03b3 depositions at energies near the Q-value ( 214 Bi) occurring via the photoeffect (no Compton scatters) and thus having true SS topology, and several percent of \u03b2\u03b2 events that emit Bremsstrahlung photons and thus having true MS topology. Moreover, gaseous xenon offers an order of magnitude better energy resolution than LXe due to small Fano factor, hence further suppressing backgrounds, including the otherwise irreducible 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay. A challenge of this approach is reaching large exposure due to low density of gas and practical limits of building and operating high-pressure detectors. NEXT collaboration makes steady progress through a series of smaller scale prototypes. The first two \u223c1 kg scale prototypes, called NEXT-DBDM and NEXT-DEMO, have demonstrated an extrapolated FWHM energy resolution of 0.5% at Q-value 32 and an existence of topological signature, 33 respectively. The collaboration is constructing a \u223c50 kg scale prototype, NEW (NEXT-WHITE), at the Canfranc underground laboratory, Spain, to validate the design and background model for the upcoming factor of two upgrade (NEXT-100). The installation and commissioning of NEXT-100 is planned for 2017. Based on Monte-Carlo prediction of BI of <4\u202210 \u22124 keV \u22121 kg \u22121 yr \u22121 , the projected sensitivity of NEXT-100 is T 1/2 >6\u202210 25 yr at 90% C.L. after three years of running, 34 still giving it a chance to catch-up with the field.",

            "text": "NEMO (\"Neutrino Ettore Majorana Observatory\") is another program that offers superior tracking capabilities, but faces greater challenge with exposure. The previous generation experiment, NEMO-3, searched for 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay of seven isotopes from February 2003 to January 2011. The NEMO-3 detector is located in the Modane underground laboratory, France, and is capable of reconstructing full topology of events (tracks of individual \u03b2s and their energy). This not only offers greater background rejection, but may also allow to discern different mechanisms of 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay. The NEMO-3 detector consists of sectors arranged in a cylindrical geometry containing thin source foils of \u03b2\u03b2 emitters. The foils are suspended between two concentric cylindrical tracking volumes consisting of drift cells operating in Geiger mode. 36 The tracking detector, immersed in a magnetic field, is surrounded by a plastic scintillator calorimeter, monitored by PMTs. Combination of tracking and calorimetry allows to distinguish \u03b2 and \u03b3 events, while magnetic field allows one to reject pair production and external electron events. The detector is shielded from external \u03b3 backgrounds by iron and water with boric acid to suppress the neutron flux. A radon trapping facility reduces internal radon background. The strongest result was obtained for 100 Mo, for which 34.7 kg\u2022yr exposure was accumulated. No evidence for the 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 signal has been found, yielding a limit for the light Majorana neutrino mass mechanism of T 1/2 >1.1\u202210 24 years at 90% C.L.. 37 In spite of great advantages of this technology, the challenges are smallness of target foils (only 6.9 kg of 100 Mo used by NEMO-3), not great energy resolution (\u223c9% FWHM at 3034.4 keV, the Q-value of 100 Mo) and small detection efficiency (11.3% for 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay of 100 Mo for \u03b2\u03b2 energy above 2 MeV). The current stage of the program, Super-NEMO, aims to reach sensitivity up to T 1/2 >10 26 yr, 38 rivaling that of KamLAND-Zen's Phase III. It plans to achieve that by increasing mass to 100 kg, using 82 Se as primary isoptope (due to 13 times smaller rate of 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 background that with 100 Mo), improving energy resolution to 4% FWHM at 3 MeV (using bigger PMTs with higher quantum efficiency and no light-guides), and decreasing Th/U contamination (by material selection, target isotope purification, and radon trapping). Commissioning of the first module, the SuperNEMO demonstrator, is expected at the end of 2016.",

            "text": "Majorana Demonstrator is an 76 Ge experiment under construction in the Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF). It is complementary to GERDA and plans to join in efforts for the next generation 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 search. Its main goal is to demonstrate a path towards sensitivity covering IH, which requires a BI in the 4 keV ROI around Q-value of \u22643 ROI \u22121 tonne \u22121 yr \u22121 , which should scale to 1 ROI \u22121 tonne \u22121 yr \u22121 in a tonne-scale experiment due to better self-shielding. The signature feature of Majorana is the ultra-low background copper used in construction of the cryostat and other detector components. The copper is made by the collaboration using electroforming at SURF and shallow underground site of PNNL. Using the most sensitive ICP-MS-based assay technique, 39 the copper was shown to have U/Th limits of <0.1 \u00b5Bq/kg. In addition to the GERDA's PSD analysis, Majorana also developed an alternative approach 40 for discriminating multi-and single-site events. Analysis of natural background data (in particular, single and double escape events of 208 Tl, which have MS and SS topology, respectively) resulted in a survival probability of just 1.0(\u00b10.2)% for such MS events versus 98.3(\u00b121.9)% of SS events, roughly corresponding to 100 to 1 rejection fraction. The first full detector module containing 20 enriched (16.8 kg) and 9 natural (5.7 kg) Ge detectors was installed and started in-shield measurements in June 2015. A second module with another 15 (12.9 kg) enriched and 15 (9.4 kg) natural Ge detectors was being assembled at the end of 2015. If the expected BI of 3 ROI \u22121 tonne \u22121 yr \u22121 (about an order of magnitude smaller than GERDA's Phase I) is achieved, Majorana Demonstrator will reach sensitivity level of 1\u202210 26 yr after about three years of operation. 41 The AMoRE (Advanced Mo based Rare process Experiment) collaboration is going to use 40 Ca 100 MoO 4 (CMO) crystals with a total mass of 100 kg as cryogenic scintillation detector to search for 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay of 100 Mo. 42 Simultaneous detection of phonons and scintillation light is a potentially very powerful tool to reject backgrounds from internal radioactive contamination of crystals. The collaboration is making progress in development of large crystals and characterization of their radio-purity and optical properties. 42 The energy resolution was demonstrated to be comparable to that of germanium detectors. 43 The first phase (AMoRE-I) will use 5 kg (possible, 10 kg) of CMO crystals to be installed at the YangYang underground laboratory, South Korea. The aimed background level in \u00b110 keV ROI around 100 Mo Q-value (3.034 MeV) is 40 ROI \u22121 tonne \u22121 yr \u22121 (based on rate per keV quoted in 44 ). AMoRe is expected to eventually achieve sensitivity of 3\u202210 26 yr after 250 kg\u2022yr exposure. Table 1 summarizes half-life limits for light Majorana mediated 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay and BIs for the currently leading experiments. The BIs are expressed in units of ROI \u22121 (isotope tonne) \u22121 yr \u22121 . Note the unusual BI normalization in the tableper mass of the isotope of interest, instead of per mass of the element (as is typically done by experiments and also by us in the detailed descriptions above). We think that normalizing per mass of the isotope of interest provides for the more straightforward comparison and insight into how far the present results are from the next generation goal of covering IH. In order to compare the half-life results obtained with different isotopes we need to convert them into limits on effective Majorana mass. Fig. 2 shows such comparisons assuming the simplest mechanism of 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay and vacuum value of the axial vector coupling constant. The range of limits on the effective Majorana mass depends on used NMEs (EDF, 45 NSM, 46 (R)QRPA 47 ) and phase-space factors. 3 The combination of results from several datasets (Cuorcino and Cuore-0, NEMO-3, first phases of EXO-200, KamLAND-Zen, and GERDA) was recently reported 48 as m \u03b2\u03b2 <130-310 meV at 90% C.L. The combined result, however, would be completely dominated by KamLAND-Zen if its latest result 18 is taken into account.",

            "text": "3.1. nEXO nEXO (\"next EXO\") is being designed as a 5 tonne enriched LXe cylindrical TPC detector. It borrows basic approach from EXO-200, but several improvements need to be made to achieve the goal of having 3\u03c3 discovery potential completely covering the IH region after 10 years of data. Having a bigger homogeneous detector allows one to take a better advantage of external \u03b3 background reduction by self-shielding. To remove any material from the most pure central region of the detector, nEXO is planning to place the cathode at an end of the TPC, instead of in the middle, as EXO-200. The challenge here is to maintain low loss of ionization electrons to impurities during the longer drift length, which is expected to be achievable with increased xenon re-circulation flow rate, and to demonstrate stable operation with larger high voltage needed to maintain the electric field in the bigger detector. nEXO needs to improve the energy resolution compared to what has been demonstrated with EXO-200 to keep 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay from becoming a significant background. It expects to achieve this by increasing the light collection and reducing noise, by covering up to \u223c4-5 m 2 of the TPC's barrel with silicon photomultipliers, 49 which have much higher gain than APDs used in EXO-200, and by maximizing reflectivity of internal components. nEXO is planning to deploy the detector at a deeper location (e.g., SNOLAB) than EXO-200, thus reducing cosmogenically-produced 137 Xe background, which currently amounts to roughly a quarter of the background budget in EXO-200. In EXO-200 resolving multiple scatters allowed for roughly 3 to 1 rejection of \u03b3 backgrounds at Q-value. nEXO aims to double the rejection fraction with the help of new charge readout scheme, now under prototyping, and lower noise electronics, possibly submerged in LXe. A continuing challenge is the radiopurity of detector components. For example, nEXO needs to demonstrate an order of magnitude lower limits on U/Th backgrounds in TPC copper, compared to EXO-200, in order for the projected discovery potential to completely cover the IH region (for the worst-case NME and no g A quenching). The collaboration is expanding the screening and characterization program to address the radiopurity questions. An ultimate background rejection technique would be to identify individual 136 Ba atoms or ions following \u03b2\u03b2 decay of 136 Xe (\"Ba-tagging\"). While work on various approaches to Ba-tagging continues, [50][51][52] at least initial operation of nEXO is not expected to achieve it. Xenon is one of the best choices of isotopes in terms of scalability, but amassing 5 tonne of enriched isotope is not trivial. World production of xenon in 1998 was estimated to be 28-40 tonne/yr, 53 which corresponds to 3-4 tonne of 136 Xe.",

However, as a result LZ will have some sensitivity to 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2. Major background contributions include the TPC PMTs, the xenon vessel, and the resistors in the field cage and cathode high voltage connection. There is some contribution from the radioactivity of the Davis cavern walls that is still under investigation. At worst some additional shielding, over what is in the current baseline plan, may be necessary above and below the xenon vessel, but not on the sides. In order to extend the dynamic range over previous experiments, LZ will have two DAQ channels, one with high-gain for the low-energy (0 to 100's of keV) data and one with low-gain for high-energy (\u223c MeV) data. The LZ projection is a median expected 90% C.L. sensitivity of T 1/2 > 1.0\u2022 10 26 yr. LZ is planned to start taking data in 2020 and will run for five years. In the future, this half-life sensitivity could be extended by one order of magnitude by either filling LZ with enriched xenon or in a similar 50 tonne detector filled with natural xenon. LZ is already fully funded, so doing the former can be accomplished at only a fraction of the cost of a dedicated tonnescale LXe experiment, providing for a natural synergy between the dark matter and 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 research goals. In a 50 tonne detector, one would exploit the self-shielding of liquid xenon to reduce backgrounds. The DARWIN collaboration has made a similar suggestion. 54 ",

Tellurium offers very good scalabity due to high natural abundance (34%) of 130 Te, not requiring enrichment. SNO+ will fill 6-m radius spherical acrylic vessel (AV) located in the SNOLAB, Canada, with about 0.78 kton of liquid scintillator. The scintillator will be loaded with Te. Initial concentration is set to 0.3% (800 kg of 130 Te), which was demonstrated to retain good light yield, attenuation, and 2 year stability. 56 The scintillator's purity is expected to be comparable to KamLAND's. The scintillation time profile depends on the density of energy depositions, allowing one to discriminate \u03b1 backgrounds. The scintillation light will be viewed by \u223c9300 PMTs supported by a geodesic stainless steel structure, filled with about 7 kton of ultra-pure water, which provides a shield for external backgrounds. Further external background rejection is provided by self-shielding. Internal backgrounds could be measured in situ prior to 130 Te loading to address possible presence of unexpected sources. Expected main internal backgrounds, in the order of contribution, are 8 B solar neutrinos (flat continuum from elastically scattered electrons), 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2, and 238 U/ 232 Th chains. Sub-dominant sources are cosmogenically produced isotopes and (\u03b1,n) reaction with subsequent release of 2.22 MeV neutron capture \u03b3.

SNO+ has projected sensitivity of 9\u202210 25 yr for 0.3% loading after 5 years (Phase I). Phase I is expected to start in 2017. The challenge for covering IH is to increase the isotope loading while maintaining good enough attenuation length, light emission levels, and scintillator stability.
