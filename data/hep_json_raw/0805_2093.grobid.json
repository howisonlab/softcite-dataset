We find that both experimental and phenomenological sources of systematic uncertainties can be strongly constrained with Z measurements: the lineshape, d\u03c3 Z /dm, is robustly predicted, and its analysis provides an accurate measurement of the detector resolution and absolute scale, while the differential cross-section analysis, d 2 \u03c3 Z /dydp T , absorbs the strong interaction uncertainties. A sensitivity \u03b4 m W \u223c 7 MeV for each decay channel (W \u2192 e\u03bd, W \u2192 \u00b5\u03bd), and for an integrated luminosity of 10 fb \u22121 , appears as a reasonable goal.",

Its most precisely measured parameters \u03b1 QED , G \u00b5 , and m Z , provide constraints on the W boson and top quark masses, which can be confronted with measurement. Injecting the measured value of the W mass and the measured Z boson couplings, a definite prediction is given for the top quark mass [3]. This prediction, together with the discovery of the top quark at a compatible mass [4,5], has been a major achievement in high energy physics.",

Any possible time dependence of the energy response can be treated in the same way, provided the analysed W and Z event samples are taken from identical data taking periods (\"runs\").

Figure 7). As a first approximation, the same procedure can be applied; the averaging over \u03b7 then assumes that leptons from W and Z are reconstructed with similar performance, with the same averaging contribution to the global detector resolution. The averaging can be improved by reweighting the \u03b7 \u2113 distribution observed in Z events, where the scale is measured, to reproduce the distribution observed in W events where the scale applied. The detector response to leptons of given transverse momentum is then identical by construction in W and Z decays, up to the statistical precision of the reweighting. As will be seen in Section 6, the absolute scale determination is very stable against variations of the underlying physics hypotheses. In particular, it is negligibly affected by PDF uncertainties, which are the main factor determining the physical rapidity distribution of the Z boson and its decay products. The reweighting does thus not introduce hidden physics uncertainties, and does not affect the discussion of other systematic uncertainties.",

This confrontation of measurements is expected to allow to understand the source of any observed non-linearities in terms of magnetic field effects, imperfect alignement, excess of passive material in the detector, etc. It will thus be possible to confront several independent probes of the detector scale; compatibility between these measurements then validates its use for the measurement of m W .

This then implies that the impact of sea quark PDF uncertainties on W and Z production should be very similar.

At ATLAS, a precision of \u223c10% is assumed in the electron channel, where this background is expected to be significant. The assumed improvement is justified by the superior granularity and resolution of the EM calorimeter [15]. The muon final state is less contaminated by jet events, muons being measured behind all calorimetry. A specific background is however constituted by muons from hadron decays in flight. As we have no measure of the uncertainty on this background, our results implicitly assume it is small. We stress that these estimates are essentially qualititative.

Another assumption is that the non-perturbative mechanisms controling the p W T and p Z T distributions remain essentially universal, although heavy flavour contributions to W and Z production are different. The effect of heavy flavours on the p W T distribution has been studied [50], but a study comparing these effects on W and Z production is currently lacking. The largest remaining systematic comes from the modeling of p W T , in the p \u2113 T -based measurement, contributing a 3 MeV uncertainty.

We base our comparison on the p \u2113 T -based m W measurement and 10 fb \u22121 of data. CMS claims 2 MeV from the absolute scale, agreeing with our average scale result of Section 3.1.1. A simplified treatment of non-linearities leaves a systematic uncertainty of 10 MeV, and the assumed 8% relative knowledge on the resolution contributes 5 MeV; these numbers can be compared to the 4 MeV we obtain in Section 3.1.2. We include a discussion of the reconstruction efficiency uncertainty, which is omitted in [14]. On the theoretical side, the present note and Reference [14] agree on the initial uncertainties related to PDFs and the description of the W transverse momentum distribution. Our improvements in this respect rely on an analysis of the constraints provided by the analysis of the Z boson differential cross-section at the LHC. Finally, we claim a statistical sensitivity of about 2 MeV, compared to 15 MeV in [14]. This is explained by CMS choosing to base the W templates on measured Z events (via the scaled observable method, or scaling the kinematics event by event), thus paying for the smaller Z boson production rate. Such a procedure is in principle justified by the reduction of other systematic uncertainties, but as we saw throughout this paper this does not seem to be a worthy trade.",

We argued that the theory is under very good control, having notably allowed a very precise Z mass measurement at LEP1, where QED effects are large, but the uncertainties finally have an almost negligible contribution. To preserve this situation at the LHC, the m W measurement requires QED simulation tools providing the same level of accuracy.",

Releasing the light flavour symmetry assumption in use in the current global QCD fits will cause a decorrelation between W and Z production at the LHC. This decorrelation can be expected to be small, but will have to be measured at the LHC, notably using the rapidity-dependent W charge asymmetry and the study of associated W /Z + charm production. Similarly, heavy flavour PDFs generate some decorrelation. This decorrelation was verified to be small in the y W and y Z distributions, and the same was assumed true for the p W T and p Z T distributions. To verify this assumption requires a theoretical study comparing the heavy flavours influence on soft gluon resummation in W and Z events.",
