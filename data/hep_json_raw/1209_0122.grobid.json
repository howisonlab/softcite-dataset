The search was performed with the ICARUS T600 detector located at the Gran Sasso Laboratory, receiving CNGS neutrinos from CERN at an average energy of about 20 GeV, after a flight path of \u223c730 km. The LSND anomaly would manifest as an excess of \u03bd e events, characterized by a fast energy oscillation averaging approximately to sin 2 (1.27 m 2 new L/E \u03bd ) \u2248 1/2 with probability P \u03bd \u03bc \u2192\u03bd e = 1/2 sin 2 (2\u03b8 new ). The present analysis is based on 1091 neutrino events, which are about 50 % of the ICARUS data collected in 2010-2011. Two clear \u03bd e events have been found, compared with the expectation of 3.7 \u00b1 0.6 events from conventional sources. Within the range of our observations, this result is compatible with the absence of a LSND anomaly. At 90 % and 99 % confidence levels the limits of 3.4 and 7.3 events corresponding to oscillation probabilities P \u03bd \u03bc \u2192\u03bd e \u2264 5.4 \u00d7 10 \u22123 and P \u03bd \u03bc \u2192\u03bd e \u2264 1.1 \u00d7 10 \u22122 are set respectively. The result strongly limits the window of open options for the LSND anomaly to a narrow region around ( m 2 , sin 2 (2\u03b8)) new = (0.5 eV 2 , 0.005), where there is an overall agreement (90 % CL) between the present ICARUS limit, the published limits of KARMEN and the published positive signals of LSND and MiniBooNE Collaborations.",

Therefore it accounts for the effects of Fermi motion, Pauli principle, and other initial and final state effects such as, for instance, reinteractions of the reaction products inside the target Argon nucleus [25]. All reaction products are transported in the T600 volume, with detailed simulation of energy losses by ionisation, delta ray production, electromagnetic and hadronic interactions. Ionisation charge along the track is subject to the experimentally observed recombination effects [26]. Energy depositions are registered in grid structures that reproduce the actual wire orientation and spacing, with a fine granularity (0.2 mm) in the drift direction. The resulting charge is convoluted with the readout channel response (including wire signal induction and electronics response), including noise parameters extracted from the real data.

To this initial sample, a minimal fiducial volume cut has been applied to collect as much statistics as possible: the interaction vertex is required to be at a distance of at least 5 cm from each side of the active volume and at least 50 cm from its downstream wall. These cuts allow for the identification of electron showers, but are neither stringent enough for the reconstruction of neutrino energies, nor for the identification of \u03bd \u03bc CC vs NC events. Furthermore, only events with a deposited energy smaller than 30 GeV have been included in the analysis, in order to optimize the signal over background ratio.

In this case, any uncertainty in the deposited energy spectrum is reflected in an equal uncertainty on the effect of the energy cut.

The ionisation information of the early part-before the showering of the e.m. track has occurred-is examined wire by wire in order to tag the presence of an initial electron emitted in the neutrino interaction, as a powerful eliminator of \u03b3 -converting pairs, which are generally separated from the vertex and generate double minimum ionising tracks. The rejection factor based on ionisation increases dramatically with increasing photon energies, while the electron identification efficiency is almost constant. Indeed, the possible photon misidentification is essentially due to photons undergoing Compton scattering, whose cross section becomes negligible with respect to the pair production above a few hundreds MeV. Monte Carlo studies indicate a residual contamination of about 0.18 % for the energy spectrum of photons from pion decays in CNGS events, rising to a few % in the sub-GeV energy region. The loss in efficiency for electron showers is only 10 %. First results from an ongoing study on low energy showers from isolated secondary \u03c0 0 's in the T600 CNGS data confirm the MC expectation (see Fig. 2). The plot shows a good agreement between data and simulations, including the low ionisation tail due to Compton interactions.",

The close similarity of the MC simulation with actual ICARUS events (see Figs. 4(A) and (B)) is apparent In order to determine the electron signature selection efficiency \u03b7, \u03bd e events have been generated with MC according to the \u03bd \u03bc CC spectrum. A simulated event is shown in Fig. 3. Out of an initial sample of 171\u03bd \u03bc \u2192 \u03bd e MC reconstructed events, 146 events have a visible energy smaller than 30 GeV, 122 of which satisfy the fiducial volume cuts (a). These events have been visually and independently scanned by three different people in different locations. An excellent agreement has been found with differences in less than 3 % of the sample. As a result, the average number of positively identified electron-like neutrino events is 90, corresponding to a selection efficiency \u03b7 = 0.74 \u00b1 0.05. In a good approximation \u03b7 is independent of the details of the energy spectrum. The systematic error on \u03b7 induced by the dE/dx cut is bound to be smaller than 1 % from the already discussed agreement to better than 2.5 % between the measured and the predicted scale of the dE/dx for muons in \u03bd \u03bc CC (see Fig. 1A).",

Even if disappearance and ap-pearance results should not be referred to a single effective \u03b8 and m 2 , the plot allows situating the residual \"LSND anomaly\" in the framework of the present neutrino oscillation results. While for m 2 new 1 eV 2 there is already disagreement between the allowed regions from the published experiments, for m 2 new \u2264 1 eV 2 the ICARUS result now allows to define a much smaller, narrower region centered around ( m 2 , sin 2 (2\u03b8)) new = (0.5 eV 2 , 0.005) in which there is 90 % CL agreement between (1) the present ICARUS limit, (2) the limits of KARMEN and (3) the positive signals of LSND and MiniBooNE collaborations. This is the area in which the expectations from cosmology suggest a substantial contribution to the dark mass signal. This region will be better explored by the proposed ICARUS/NESSiE dual detector experiment [36,37] to be performed at CERN at much shorter distances (\u223c300 m and \u223c1.6 km) and lower neutrino energies, which increase the event rate, reduce the overall multiplicity of the events, enlarge the angular range and therefore improve substantially the \u03bd e selection efficiency.",
