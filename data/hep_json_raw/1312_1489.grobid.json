One approach to measure heavyflavour production is via electrons from semi-leptonic decays of heavy-flavour hadrons. In this contribution we present the nuclear modification factor (RAA) and the azimuthal anisotropy (v2) of heavy-flavour decay electrons in Pb-Pb collisions at \u221a sNN = 2.76 TeV, which are sensitive to the interaction of c and b quarks with the medium. We also present, for the first time, the azimuthal angular correlations of heavy-flavour decay electrons and charged hadrons, \u2206\u03c6(HFE , h), in Pb-Pb collisions and the corresponding near-side yield ratio (IAA).",

Heavy-flavour particles produced in such collisions are a useful probe of the medium since they carry information about the full evolution of the system. One way to measure heavy-flavour production is through the measurement of electrons from heavy-flavour hadron decays (HFE ). The observables discussed here reflect the interaction of heavy quarks with the medium. These are the nuclear modification factor (R AA ), the elliptic flow of (v 2 ) of HFE and the azimuthal angular correlations between HFE and charged hadrons (\u2206\u03c6(HFE , h)). R AA , which can be interpreted in terms of parton energy loss in the medium, is defined as the ratio of p T -differential yields measured in nucleus-nucleus collisions to the corresponding cross-section in pp collisions scaled by the nuclear overlap function < T AA >.",

The particle identification system (PID) consists of a Time of Flight (TOF) detector, the TPC with which the specific ionization energy loss (dE /dx ) of charged particles is measured and the Electromagnetic Calorimeter (EMCal), which registers electromagnetic showers in part of the central barrel acceptance (|\u03b7| < 0.7 and 80 \u2022 < \u03c6 < 180 \u2022 ). At low p T (p T < 6 GeV/c for the present analysis) electrons are identified with the TPC and TOF detectors, while with the EMCal the measurement can be extended to higher p T . In Pb-Pb collisions, the centrality was determined from the sum of the amplitudes of the signals in the VZERO detector and defined in terms of percentiles of the total hadronic Pb-Pb cross section.

The general analysis strategy used for all measurements presented here involves the identification of electrons and the statistical removal of the background from sources other than heavy-flavour hadron decays (Non-HFE ). This background is dominated by electrons from photon conversions in the detector material and Dalitz decays of light neutral mesons ( mostly \u03c0 0 and \u03b7). Two methods are available to remove the background, the invariant mass method and the cocktail method [1]. In the invariant mass method one makes use of the fact that electron-positron pairs from conversions and Dalitz decays have a small invariant mass and can thus be tagged. In the cocktail method, the Non-HFE background is calculated with a Monte-Carlo generator using the measured \u03c0 0 and \u03b7 p T -differential yields as input.",
