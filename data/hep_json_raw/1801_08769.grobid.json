The dataset consists of proton-proton collisions with an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb \u22121 at a centre-of-mass energy of \u221a s = 13 TeV recorded by the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. Resonance candidates are identified as massive large-radius jets with substructure consistent with a particle decaying into a quark pair. The mass spectrum of the candidates is examined for local excesses above background. No evidence of a new resonance is observed in the data, which are used to exclude the production of a lepto-phobic axial-vector Z 0 boson.",

At the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the ability to discover or exclude such hadronic resonances has been extended into the TeV range, although no evidence of statistically significant excesses has been seen [8,9].",

The recording of collision data typically requires placing thresholds of several hundred GeV on the transverse momentum (p min T ) of the jet used to trigger the event, which translates to approximate thresholds on mass of m \u2248 2p min T . Consequently, recent searches for dijet resonances at the LHC have poor sensitivity for masses well below 1 TeV. This limitation can be avoided by recording only a summary of the jet information needed for performing a resonance search in the dijet mass spectrum. This strategy is called \"data scouting\" in CMS [10], \"real-time analysis\" in LHCb [11] and \"trigger-object-level analysis\" in ATLAS [12], and has set limits for resonance masses in the range 500-800 GeV [10].",

The dominant background processes are multijet production in the jet channel and photons produced in association with jets in the photon channel, both characterised by non-resonant jets initiated predominantly by single gluons or light-flavour quarks. The Z 0 signal models considered decay to quark-antiquark pairs. This difference in the dominant jet production mechanism between the signal and the leading backgrounds means that, in the boosted regime considered in this Letter, the use of jet substructure methods strongly suppresses the background, making it a crucial component for the search sensitivity. In addition, current datasets are the largest collected, allowing the sensitivity to rare processes to be extended beyond that of earlier studies. 1 ATLAS uses a right-handed coordinate system with its origin at the nominal interaction point (IP) in the centre of the detector and the z-axis along the beam pipe. The x-axis points from the IP to the centre of the LHC ring, and the y-axis points upwards. Cylindrical coordinates (r, \u03c6) are used in the transverse plane, \u03c6 being the azimuthal angle around the z-axis. The pseudorapidity is defined in terms of the polar angle \u03b8 as \u03b7 = \u2212 ln tan(\u03b8/2). It is equivalent to the rapidity for massless Recently, CMS reported results of applying a similar technique [14,15] to exclude a light Z 0 boson with Standard Model (SM) coupling values (g q ) exceeding 0.1 to 0.25 in the mass range 50-300 GeV. With respect to those results, this Letter also exploits the channel with the ISR photon.",

In order to enhance the sensitivity to the signal, jet substructure techniques are used to identify the expected two-body quark-pair signal-like events within a single large-R jet. One of the commonly used jet substructure variables is \u03c4 21 [51], defined as the ratio \u03c4 2 /\u03c4 1 . The variable \u03c4 N is a measure of how consistent a given jet's constituents are with being fully aligned along N or more axes; thus \u03c4 21 is a useful discriminant for differentiating between a two-particle jet from the decay of a boosted resonance and a single-particle jet. However, \u03c4 21 is correlated with the reconstructed large-R jet mass m J . Any selection requirement on \u03c4 21 leads to a selection of jets from the leading background processes with efficiency strongly dependent on the jet mass, and modifies the final jet mass distribution in a way that makes it difficult to model using a simple functional approach, effectively increasing the systematic uncertainties and weakening the overall sensitivity. To avoid this, the designed decorrelated tagger (DDT) method [14,52,53] is used to decorrelate \u03c4 21 from the reconstructed jet mass. The variable \u03c1 DDT is defined as",

If the difference between the data and the background estimate in the VR is larger than the derived uncertainty, the uncertainty is inflated by a scale factor, without changing the nominal value of the background estimate.

For the ISR jet channel, the scale factor in the background uncertainty is found to be consistent with 1, while for the ISR \u03b3 channel the scale factor ranges from 1 to 2 across the values of m Z 0 .

            "text": "As a cross-check, the TF method is applied to a candidate mass range near the W and Z boson masses: the signal region's mass range is set as a \u00b120% window around 85 GeV ([68, 102] GeV), and the validation region as a \u00b130% window around the same mass, but with the SR removed ([59.5, 68] GeV and [102, 110.5] GeV). Fig. 2 shows distributions of the large-R jet mass for data and the resulting background estimate. The latter is found to agree with the data within uncertainties. The SM prediction for W and Z production is scaled with the NLO cross section using NLO K -factors, as described in Section 3. The cross sections used are 40.6 pb (18.6 pb) for the W ( Z )+jets processes in the ISR jet channel, and 1.52 pb (0.983 pb) for W ( Z )+\u03b3 processes in the ISR \u03b3 channel. These cross sections are taken from the phase space of p T (W , Z ) > 280 (140) GeV for the jet (photon) channels, as motivated by the analysis kinematic selections. The best-fit signal strength relative to the SM prediction for W and Z production, \u03bc = \u03c3 /\u03c3 W /Z , is \u03bc = 0.93 \u00b1 0.03 (stat) \u00b1 0.24 (syst) in the ISR jet channel and \u03bc = 1.07 \u00b1 0.13 (stat) \u00b1 0.35 (syst) in the ISR \u03b3 channel, consistent with the SM predictions. This result shows that the TF method works well.",

The search is based on 36.1 fb \u22121 of 13 TeV pp collisions recorded by the ATLAS detector at the LHC. Resonance candidates are identified as massive large-radius jets with substructure consistent with a quark pair. The mass spectrum of the candidates is examined for local excesses above a data-derived estimate of a smoothly falling background. No evidence of anomalous phenomena is observed in the data, and limits are presented on the cross section and couplings of a leptophobic axial-vector Z 0 benchmark model. Upper limits at 95% confidence level on production cross sections times acceptance are 0.50 pb (0.04 pb) for a 100 GeV signal hypothesis, and 0.35 pb (0.03 pb) for a 220 GeV signal hypothesis in the ISR jet (ISR \u03b3 ) channels. The observed upper limits on the coupling g q are 0.17 for m Z 0 = 100 GeV and 0.21 for m Z 0 = 220 GeV, when combining ISR jet and ISR \u03b3 channels.",
