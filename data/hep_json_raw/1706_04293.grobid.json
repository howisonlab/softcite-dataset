For example, in astroparticle physics an event may be defined as all the data produced by a very energetic cosmic ray particle as it interacts with the atmosphere. In particle colliders, an event includes all the data produced in a beam crossing, when particle interactions occur, with the caveat that some of the collected information may belong to previous crossings due to the finite speed of detector electronics. In neutrino experiments, an event occurs when a neutrino interacts with a nucleus of an atom in the detector. Simulation software in high-energy physics (HEP) experiments is designed to produce, in an ideal scenario, events which are identical to those resulting from the actual experiment. The output data format is typically the same for simulated and real events, so that event processing and physics analysis is performed in the same way and with the same tools.",

Generators provide the final state particles in a hard collision, a cosmic ray particle shower, a neutrino beam with the desired energy and angular distribution, or any other set of particles to be observed in the detector. A second module simulates the passage of the generated particles through the detector material and its magnetic field. In most contemporary experiments, this detector simulation module is based on the Geant4 simulation toolkit [1,2], a software package that provides the tools to describe the detector geometry and materials, and incorporates a large number of models to simulate electromagnetic and hadronic interactions of particles with matter. The next module simulates the detector electronics and the calibration of individual channels. At the end of the chain, the same algorithms used to identify and reconstruct individual particles and physics observables in real data are applied to simulated events. Fig. 1 describes a generic simulation software chain and the functionality of each module for a typical HEP experiment.",

            "text": "There was a time, however, when experiments modeled their detectors using simple analytic or back-of-the-envelope calculations, toy simulations, or parametrizations based on theoretical predictions, or experimental data of the passage of particles through matter and electromagnetic fields. The era of detailed detector simulation started in the late 1970's and early 1980's when the Electron Gamma Shower software (EGS) [3] was developed, and the GEANT team released GEANT3 [4], a software toolkit that allowed the experiments to describe complex geometry, propagate particles through these geometries, and trace the incident and secondary particles as they interact with the different materials according to physics models implemented as part of the toolkit. It did not take too long before GEANT3 was widely used at the European Center  for Nuclear Research (CERN), the German Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron (DESY) and the US Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (FNAL) experiments. Although initially of limited use because of the insufficient speed of computers in those days, these GEANT3-based full detector simulation software applications became the norm through the nineteen nineties and revolutionized the way the particle physics community plans experiments, design detectors, and perform physics measurements. It should not be necessary to clarify that particles cannot be discovered through simulation. For example, the Higgs boson can only be observed in simulated data if its production mechanisms and decay modes are coded in the event generator package that feeds the detector simulation module. What a simulation does is to teach physicists what mark the Higgs boson would leave in the real detector if it were present in the data sample. For instance, the Standard Model of Elementary Particles and their Interactions (SM) predicts that the Higgs boson decays into two photons with certain kinematic properties. Using simulation, physicists designed detectors and data analysis procedures that targeted Higgs searches with the goal to identify events with the characteristics predicted by theories. In 2012, the observation of events of this kind in real data signaled a discovery by the ATLAS [5] and CMS [6] experiments at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Real-life physics measurement procedures are more complex than the example presented here but the general idea is always the same in what pertains to the role of simulation.",

The goal is to make the ParSim much faster than the FullSim, typically a couple of orders of magnitude, and almost as accurate. The accuracy limitations of ParSim tools are typically more severe in describing particle shower shapes and related detector effects such as energy leakage beyond the detector boundaries, and regions of phase space where data are not available. ParSim tools may also be based on GEANT3 or Geant4 up-to-the-point of the first interaction of primary incident particles with matter, after which tools such as GFLASH [13] may be used to describe shower shapes and response with better or worse accuracy, depending on the number of parameters used to describe the showers and the time performance cost the experiment is willing to pay for accuracy. GFLASH-based simulations, or a simulation that uses particle shower libraries constructed from FullSim events, are sometimes used in combination with FullSim to model subdetectors with high particle occupancy, for example those located near the beam pipe in collider experiments. ParSim is commonly used for detector design studies that require to test many geometry scenarios, and to generate signal samples for new physics that involve scans over a large sector of theory parameter space. In most cases, the output of ParSim applications has the same format as the output from FullSim and the data coming from the real detector.

(In the absence of public documentation, the information about the CDF QFL and GFLASH parametrized simulations was obtained from private communication with Soon Young Jun, Kenichi Hatakeyama, and Marjorie Shapiro.) QFL was based on a detailed geometry description and accurate parametrization of single particle showers. Pion information was extracted from minimum bias and track triggers in the 0.75-20 GeV range and test beam pion data were utilized in the higher 57-145 GeV energy range. This approach provided a suitable solution in the 1989-1990 (Run 0) and 1991-1996 (Run 1) data taking periods to deal with the fact that GEANT3based simulations were still too slow to be practical. In 2002, QFL was replaced with a hybrid application that utilized GEANT3 to model the detector geometry and track particles, but only up to the point when the incident particles interact with the detector material for the first time, with subsequent showers modeled with GFLASH parametrizations tuned to test beam and collider data. In contrast, the D0 experiment followed a FullSim approach from the start of Run 1 in 1991, since the absence of a solenoidal magnetic field within the tracker made it challenging to tune a ParSim tool with high precision. However, in the interest of speed, D0 introduced approximations such as a mixed plate geometry option, based on average material, rather than a full plate option, based on the actual material detail. In addition, showers were truncated once 95% of the energy of the shower was released in the detector material, approximation that had a significant impact on the description of hadron energy response linearity, and on shower shapes. Twenty years later, the availability of more advanced computing and software systems has allowed the ATLAS and CMS experiments to develop FullSim applications and generate tens of billions of Geant4-based events per year with unprecedented geometry, material and magnetic field detail, as well as significantly improved physics models. In CMS, the amount of CPU (Central Processing Unit in a computer) time spent per event during the 2009-2013 (Run 1) period ranged between 15 seconds for the simplest events to three minutes for more complex events such as those with top quarks or many high momentum jets. In contrast, it took up to one hour per event to generate the Monte Carlo sample utilized in the W boson mass measurement at the Tevatron D0 experiment a decade earlier. In the early 1990's, most of the FullSim MC samples used by the Tevatron experiments consisted of a few hundreds of thousands events and included approximations which introduced severe limitations in their utilization.",

Since then, its areas of application have extended to include high-energy, nuclear and accelerator physics, as well as medical science and treatment, and space exploration. The GEANT saga started in 1975 with the release of GEANT1, a very basic framework to drive a simulation program providing a user-defined output with histograms. GEANT2 was released in 1976 as an extension of GEANT1. It had a more complete set of physics models, including electromagnetic (EM) showers based on a subset of the Electron Gamma Shower (EGS) [3] package, multiple scattering, particle decay, and energy loss. GEANT2 was used by several Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) experiments at CERN. The breakthrough came in 1980 with GEANT3, an evolution of the GEANT software that contained a data structure to describe complex geometries at the level required by the experiments planned for the 1980's. GEANT3 was first used in the OPAL experiment at the CERN Large Electron-Positron Collider (LEP) and then adopted by other LEP experiments, such as L3 and ALEPH.

It comes with a remarkably complete library of physics models to simulate the interactions of particles with matter. Electrons, muons, and charged hadrons interact electromagnetically with matter through processes such as ionization, bremsstrahlung, pair production, and multiple scattering. Examples of photon interactions are the photoelectric, Compton, conversion, and Rayleigh scattering processes. Hadrons, such as pions, kaons, protons, and neutrons are abundantly produced in HEP collisions and interact strongly with nuclei in the detector material. Although QCD is the theory that describes all hadronic interactions, perturbative calculations may be applied only to a small region of phase-space, while hadronization and nucleus interactions are non-perturbative and may only be described by approximate models. A hadronic shower is the result of the interaction of a single hadron with the detector material. It consists of a cascade of strong interactions producing large numbers of secondary particles of diminishing energies. The development of a hadronic shower covers a large range of energy scales, from the hundreds of GeV down to, in the case of neutrons, thermal energies. Hadronic showers are difficult to model and are of critical importance to simulate events with quark-initiated or gluon-initiated jets in the experiments.",

            "text": "The task of improving the Geant4 physics models from comparisons between MC predictions and dedicated or thin-target experiments is part of the Geant4 development process. Thin-target experiments consist of directing beams of particles of different types onto thin targets made of the materials typically used in HEP experiments. The measured cross-sections of different nuclear interactions, angular distributions, and particle multiplicities are then used to validate individual models at the microscopic, single-interaction level; examples are the CALICE [16], HARP [17,18,19], NA49 [20,21,22], and NA61 [23,24] experiments. Selecting the physics models to be used in a Geant4 application is not a one-size-fits-all operation, in the sense that some models may represent the data better than others for a given particle type, detector material, and energy range. The reason is that these models typically depend on parameters which are adjusted to the available experimental data, and not all particles, energy ranges, and target materials are present in the currently available thin-target experimental data-sets. Therefore, it is essential for particle physics experiments to validate their Geant4-based simulation software by comparing MC predictions with test beam or collider data. Test beam experiments are designed to study the performance of realistic detector prototypes or solid angle slices of the actual detectors. The data collected are not only essential to understand, optimize and calibrate the detectors, but are also of critical importance to validate the experiment's simulation software. Experiments also contribute to the MC validation process by comparing Geant4 predictions with in situ measurements performed using data collected during their physics runs. Examples of the latter are studies to understand the modeling of single charged tracks, jet response and resolution, and shower shapes.",

The squares and circles correspond to different versions of Geant4, 10.0.p02 and 10.2.p02, and collections of physics models or physics lists. The FTFP BERT EMM list is the CMS experiment default Geant4 physics list (as of May 2017), based on the Bertini and FTFP models. As illustrated, the simulation models the track data within less than 5% in the 1-20 GeV/c p Track range. Fig. 7 shows a similar measurement performed by the ATLAS experiment. ATLAS measured the E/p from min-bias data, with E the energy deposited by an isolated charged track in the calorimeter and p the momentum measured in the tracker. The background subtracted mean ratio, < E/p > COR , is plotted as a function of the track momentum p in two pseudorapidity regions, |\u03b7| < 0.6 and 1.8 < |\u03b7| < 1.9, using the 2010 and 2012 data samples. The measurements are compared to Geant4-based simulation predictions in the p = 0.5 \u2212 30 GeV range, using the FTFP BERT and QGSP BERT physics lists. In the kinematic region with small enough statistical uncertainties, the study proved that the simulation models the data to within 5% [29]. The previous examples are an illustration of how the increasing speed of computers during the last couple of decades allowed the LHC experiments to generate large-enough samples of simulated events to test different sets of Geant4 competing physics models and select those that describe the data best. Another set of experimental results utilized by modern collider experiments to discriminate between different Geant4 physics lists, and offer the Geant4 collaboration guidance on how to assemble them from individual physics models, is the set of test beam single particle energy response and resolution measurements performed for different particles such as electrons, protons, and pions. Fig. 8 depicts comparisons of MC and data measurements of the response distribution, or response function, for 4 GeV pions and 3 GeV protons incident onto a solid angle slice of the CMS ECAL and HCAL calorimeters [28]. Fig. 9 shows the mean pion and proton response as a function of the beam momentum, p beam , for 2006 test beam data and the same two Geant4 software versions and physics lists as in Fig. 8. The agreement is excellent, within uncertainties, over the whole range of particle momenta. For pions below \u223c5 GeV, there seems to be a trend with the prediction overestimating the data by a few percent, although data and MC agree within uncertainties above p beam >3 GeV. For positive pions with beam energies of 20, 50, 100, and 180 GeV, Fig. 10 depicts the ATLAS calorimeter energy response, E total /E beam , and percentage resolution as a function of the beam energy E beam . These 2000-2003 test beam results are compared to predictions from a Geant4 version 10.1 simulation using different physics list options [30]. The error bars are statistical only. The MC-to-data ratios show agreements within less than 2% for energy response and 10-15% for energy resolution.",

Furthermore, the Tevatron test beam programs were very limited in scope and data-taking capabilities, in detriment of the MC validation exercise. Fig. 11 shows the electron-to-pion energy response ratio, e/\u03c0, versus beam energy as measured in the D0 Liquid Argon-Uranium calorimeter test beam experiment that took place in 1991 [31]. In the case of CMS, statistical uncertainties in simulated data are negligible and the agreement is much better than for D0 in the energy range covered by the experiments. Furthermore, the CMS comparison extends to energies as low as 1 GeV while the D0 measurement and comparison stops at 10 GeV. In CMS, the modeling of the momentum dependence of the single particle response is excellent, while in D0 e/\u03c0 flattens out much faster in MC than in data. Figure 6: MC-to-data comparison results for isolated charged tracks in CMS min-bias events [28]. The vertical axis displays the MC-over-data ratio of the ratio of the energy measured in the calorimeters over the momentum measured in the tracker, for a single isolated track.

Experiments used well-tuned ParSim options instead, such as QFL or the GEANT3-GFLASH tools developed in CDF. Pure Geant MC samples were either not accurate enough due to approximations to gain speed, they were statistically limited, or both. The situation changed significantly in the last few years when the availability of large samples of significantly more realistic simulated events became the norm in HEP experiments. As a result, MC-driven methods are being used with increasing frequency and confidence, as long as they are based on simulation code that has been thoroughly validated within systematic uncertainties, using thin target, test beam, and in situ experimental data. Data-driven methods, based on physics laws applied to real data, are still at the core of the derivation of calibration and correction factors applied to data measurements, while closure tests are essential to test the validity and precision of the methods. Closure tests are based on the comparison between the detector-level MC data, treated as if it were real data, and the Monte Carlo truth information associated with the particles of an event before they interacted with the detector.",

The observed energy of jets in HEP detectors needs to be calibrated with a scale factor, which depends on the jet type and kinematics, and includes corrections for electronic noise, additional hard interactions in the same beam-beam crossing, detector response, and reconstruction algorithm effects. In a collider experiment, the response correction may be derived using conservation of momentum in the transverse plane, and the fact that the energy response and resolution are much better for electromagnetically interacting physics objects, such as photons or electrons, than they are for jets. The relatively small energy calibration factors for photons are similar to those for electrons, which are typically derived from Z \u2192 e + e \u2212 samples. Once the photon scale is adjusted, jets may be calibrated using p T balancing, that is transverse momentum conservation in each event. To increase sample statistics and the accuracy of the measurement, jets in forward \u03b7 regions may be calibrated from di-jet events with one jet in the central region (\u03b7 close to 0). As a bonus, the jet energy or p T resolution may be derived from the width of the asymmetry distribution,",

The CMS experiment uses a hybrid approach where the MC truth prediction of the jet energy scale is adjusted by small factors derived from the above-mentioned data-driven techniques [35], in order to take into account the differences of jet energy scale in data and simulated events. ATLAS uses a similar calibration scheme based on both MC-driven and data-driven techniques [36]. Fig. 12 (top) shows the CMS data-to-MC ratio of the jet energy response as a function of jet p T , determined from two different data-driven methods: p T balancing (solid squares) and Missing p T Fraction (solid circles). The Missing p T Fraction Method (MPF) is a variation of p T balancing, that uses the projection of the event transverse momentum imbalance vector onto the direction of the photon to estimate the response of the hadronic recoil. The message contained in Fig. 12 is that the normalization factor between the jet energy response measured in data and modeled in the CMS Full Simulation is approximately SF R =0.985 with an uncertainty of less than 2%. Moreover, the ratio shows that the p T dependence is flat to within the small uncertainties represented by the error bands. Although this ratio also depends on the jet flavor and pseudorapidity, the data-to-MC normalization or \"scale\" factors are in all cases small enough to allow CMS to follow the approach of extracting the jet energy response directly from MC truth information. In other words, the jet energy response applied as a correction to the jet energy in real collider data, R jet , is calculated as SF",

The SF R factor puts MC and data in the same footing, by shifting R jet in MC to model what was measured in data. This approach is significantly more accurate because, since the same data-driven method is applied to both MC and data, the uncertainty in the ratio is much smaller than that in the numerator and denominator, given that most uncertainty components are correlated and cancel. It is not the jet response what is measured but how different the measurements are in data and MC. Fig. 12 (bottom) shows the asymmetry distribution A for a CMS sample of di-jet events from where the jet p T resolution is measured. The agreement between MC and data is excellent except in the non-Gaussian tails of the distribution, which are very difficult to model in MC because they come from non-linear contributions to the detector response. Although the CMS calorimenter system (ECAL+HCAL) is undercompensating, with an e/h > 2 (e, h are the response to the energy deposited by an incident hadron through electromagnetic and nuclear interactions respectively), non-linear behavior is corrected to a large extent during calibration and through the use of tracking information by the particle flow algorithm [37].

Fig. 13 (top) shows the measured MPF response in a photon plus jets sample, as a function of p \u03b3 T in the central pseudorapidity region [38]. Also for ATLAS, the MC models the MPF response very accurately over the whole kinematic range of interest, deviating slightly from a 0.98 flat data-to-MC ratio in the lowest and highest extremes of the range. The shaded band in Fig. 13 (bottom) shows the total uncertainty in the data-to-MC MPF response ratio, which is less than 1% for p \u03b3 T > 70 GeV. The excellent data-to-MC agreement for the asymmetry distribution, A, is illustrated in Fig. 14 (top) for the ATLAS experiment [39]. Although calorimeter jets are used in this example, the ATLAS asymmetry distribution is reasonably well described by a Gaussian function, since the e/h = 1.37 value for the ATLAS calorimeter system does not deviate that much from perfect compensation, e/h = 1. Still, the modeling of the residual non-linear behavior contributing to the tails is difficult and both the data measurement and the MC prediction deviates from a perfect Gaussian distribution in the tails. Fig. 14 (bottom) shows the measured jet energy resolution, \u03c3(p T )/p T , versus the average jet p T of the two jets in the di-jet sample used for the derivation. The agreement between MC and data for the di-jet balance method is impressive, while the agreement when using the bisector method is within 10%. The bisector method [39] is a variant of the di-jet balance technique, and measures the variance of the p T balance vector projected along an orthogonal coordinate system in the transverse plane, where one of the axes is chosen in the direction that bisects the azimuthal angle formed by the two leading jets.",

One essential aspect of a search for a new particle, or a characterization of a known particle, is the selection of a signal-enhanced sample, where the particle under study represents the signal, and all other physics processes resulting in similar final states or detector signatures represent the backgrounds. Control Samples (CS's) or control regions (CR's) are background-only samples, or regions of phase space, used to estimate the background contributions in a signal region (SR) from a combination of measurements in the CR, event properties, and physics laws.

In both plots, error bars are statistical and the lower panels show data-to-MC ratios to illustrate the level of agreement between simulation and data. See Ref. [39]. study. To estimate the background in the SR, the function may be fit to the data in the CR and then extrapolated to the SR to make the prediction. Fig. 15 illustrates how MC samples are used to establish the boundaries of CR's and SR's for use in the data-driven prediction of the QCD background to multi-jet final states in a CMS Supersymmetry (SUSY) [40] search [41]. SUSY is a theory based on a symmetry that relates bosons and fermions, offering a solution to the Higgs boson hierarchy problem, and predicting the unification of gauge couplings and a dark matter candidate. Fig. 15 shows the minimum azimuthal angular distance min \u2206\u03c6(jet 1,2,3 , H miss T ) between the three leading jets in the event and the event H miss T , defined as the the negative vector sum of the p T 's of all jets in the event [42]. This angle is plotted as a function of H miss T , the absolute value of the vector. For QCD background events, min \u2206\u03c6(jet 1,2,3 , H miss T ) is small and H miss T low, since the p T imbalance comes from detector response and resolution effects, and tends to be aligned with the two approximately back-to-back leading jets. For certain SUSY models, the two leading jets and two weakly interacting BSM stable particles, called neutralinos (\u03c7 0 1 ), tend to be in opposite hemispheres of the transverse plane, generating high missing p T in the event as well as a large min \u2206\u03c6(jet 1,2,3 , H miss T ). The data-driven technique illustrated in Fig. 15 with a MC sample is known as the factorization or ABCD method. It consists of identifying three CR's (A, B, and D) and a SR (C), which corresponds to events with a large angular distance and high H miss",

The principle of the tagand-probe method, when applied to measure particle reconstruction and identification efficiencies, is to use the a priori knowledge of the identity of a reconstructed physics object (Tagged Object), for example a known resonance, and ask the question on the fraction of the times a given Probe Object is identified by a reconstruction and identification algorithm correctly. The method is also used to measure trigger efficiencies, or the probability for a hardware or software trigger system to flag an event it is designed to identify from all collisions occurring in the experiment. Particle isolation efficiency is the probability for a particle to pass a requirement of isolation with respect to other particles in the event, and fake rate is the probability for a particle to be miss-identified as a different particle by a software algorithm. Both may also be measured from real data using the tag-and-probe method. For example, the probability that an electron is missidentified as a photon, the e \u2192 \u03b3 fake rate, may be derived from three di-object samples where each of the two objects has been identified either as an electron or a photon: e + e \u2212 , e +/\u2212 \u03b3,\u03b3\u03b3. The di-object invariant mass distribution will show a distinct peak centered at the mass value of the Z boson. In average, once the non-Z di-electron continuous and monotonically decreasing background is subtracted, all the events within the m Z \u223c 91.2 GeV peak are bound to be electrons, no matter whether they have been identified as such or as e\u03b3, or \u03b3\u03b3, Figure 15: Illustration of the ABCD or factorization method for multi-jets (QCD) background estimation. The minimum azimuthal angular distance between the three leading jets in the event, min \u2206\u03c6(jet 1,2,3 , H miss T ), is shown as a function of the event H miss T , for a QCD background only sample (top) and a SUSY signal sample (bottom). It is apparent that the A, B, and D regions are dominated by the background, while the C region is background depleted and signal enhanced [42].",

Efficiencies are not defined the same way for all physics objects and in all experiments, and a good understanding of the definition details is important for their correct utilization in physics analysis. For example, the CMS muon efficiency shown in Fig. 16 refers to reconstruction plus identification (or muon sample selection) efficiency. It is the conditional probability of identifying a muon with a looser or tighter selection criteria given that a track in the tracker system exists. The CMS electron efficiency in Fig. 16 accounts for identification only, and must be multiplied by the reconstruction only efficiency to yield the combined reconstruction plus identification efficiency.",

In other words, a method not closing indicates the need to go back to the drawing board and understand the biases in the measurement procedure that are responsible for the lack of closure. Closure tests are only useful if the simulated samples accurately model the details of real data because, otherwise, some effects from the measuring procedure may be missed. The basic principle of closure tests is the possibility to compare MC truth values to data-driven measurements, with the former calculated directly from detector-level-to-particle-level information, and the latter derived from methods applied to detector-level-only information. For example, the MC truth jet energy response is determined from the ratio between the energy of detector-level reconstructed jets and the MC truth jet energy calculated as the sum of energies of all the final state particles identified as part of the jet before they hit the detector. If the jet energy response measured from detector-level MC information using data-driven methods, such as \u03b3-jet and di-jet balance, is consistent within uncertainties with the MC truth jet energy response, then the method closes. Typically, closure tests take the form of detector-level-toparticle-level ratios for an observable of interest as a function of variables such as transverse momentum or pseudorapidity. For a method to close, the ratio has to be consistent with unity within the quoted uncertainties.",

The background arises from events that mistakenly pass the p lep T > 10 GeV veto cut on the p T of isolated leptons, introduced to remove events with high p T isolated leptons from the signal sample. These mistakes occur when the lepton escapes detection due reconstruction and identification inefficiencies. The data-driven method is based on the selection of a one lepton plus jets control sample by inverting the lepton veto requirement. In such a sample, 97% of the events are either tt+jets or W +jets. Once the number of events in the control region is normalized by a factor accounting for reconstruction and identification efficiencies, (1/\u03b5 iso )[(1 \u2212 \u03b5 iso )/\u03b5 reco+id ], and the sample is restricted to the signal region, also referred to as the search region, the control sample predicts the number of electroweak background events in the search region. Figs. 19, 20 show a comparison between the predicted background (circles) and the MC truth estimated background (histograms) for H T (scalar sum of the jet p T 's), H miss T , and jet multiplicity. The excellent closure within statistical uncertainties for all three observables indicates that the method predicts the background with high accuracy and any potential biases are under control, within the quoted uncertainties. Had there been deviations of the ratios from unity, outside statistical and systematic uncertainties, potential sources of biases on the method would have been further investigated and eventually removed, most probably at the cost of additional systematic uncertainties.",

Nowadays, these simulation efforts are an absolute requirement for every HEP experiment seeking approval from funding agencies. Interestingly, Geant4 plays a dual role in the process. Firstly, it helps select the optimal design that does the physics job for the available budget. Secondly, Geant4 influences the detector design by adding its own software and computing constraints to the decision process. In other words, the optimal geometric designs are often too difficult to model with Geant4 or very expensive in computing resources.

Performance tests evaluate basic detector level observables, such as track efficiencies, photon, electron, muon and jet resolutions, as well as the potential precision of cross section or mass measurements, or the discovery reach for new particles. As an example, Fig. 21 (top) shows the predicted CMS tracking efficiency versus pseudorapidity for various tracker design options and accelerator performance parameter values associated with the high-luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) run scheduled to start in 2026. Efficiency is studied for different accelerator performance scenarios, expressed in terms of instantaneous luminosity, L = 1 \u03c3 dN dt , where dN/dt is the number of events produced as the result of the hard collision and \u03c3 is the interaction cross section. L depends on detector parameters such as the number of particles in a bunch within the beam, and the size of the beams. At the LHC, as L increases, the probability of multiple proton-proton (pp) interactions per crossing with low momentum transfer increases. These spurious interactions pile-up and overlap with the high-p T event of interest which fired the physics trigger. For different pile-up (PU) scenarios, measured in terms of the number of spurious pp interactions, Fig. 21 (top) shows the tracking efficiency for the 2017 detector (Phase I detector, black squares) and the proposed 2026 detector (Phase II detector, blue, red, green symbols) with and without a tracker upgrade that would extend the \u03b7 coverage to 3.8. The addition would extend the coverage in the region near the beam pipe, improving the tracking efficiency and reducing the fake rate (not shown), thus allowing to suppress more efficiently any spurious contribution from pile-up events to the high-p T event under study. Fig. 21 (bottom) shows the relative degradation in photon energy resolution, measured in gluon fusion Higgs events, as a function of the number of layers removed from the proposed CMS endcap calorimeter. N b/a is the number of layers before and after removal. This degradation affects measurements with the Higgs boson decaying to two photons or four electrons. Fig. 22 (top) shows how much energy from pile-up events contribute on average to a reconstructed jet as the number of pile-up events increases with luminosity. This spurious contribution changes the jet multiplicity of the event, distorts the jet energy response, and degrades jet energy and missing transverse energy resolutions. Missing transverse energy is a measure of the event momentum imbalance in the transverse plane and will be defined and discussed properly in Sec. 5.2.3. Fig. 22 (bottom) shows, using the Delphes parametrized simulation framework [49], the impact of the tracker extension and the number of pile-up events on the sensitivity of the proposed detector to SUSY particle production. The study investigates a model with electroweak production of a chargino-neutralino pair,\u03c7 \u00b1 1\u03c7 0 2 , decaying to W H and two stable neutralinos,\u03c7 0 1 , the latter being the lightest stable particle (LSP) predicted by the model. For an integrated luminosity of 3000 fb \u22121 , that is the integral of the instantaneous luminosity over the time covering the full data set expected to be collected by the CMS experiment during the HL-LHC run, the sensitivity is explored for three different scenarios: 140 PU events with and without a tracker extension, and 200 PU events with a tracker extension. The limits on the chargino mass are very sensitive to an increase in the number of PU events, although a fraction of the sensitivity is recovered with the tracker extension.",

The upgrade also includes improvements to the trigger system, detector electronics, and forward calorimetry (Reference scenario). The results presented here are based on simulated events produced with the ATLAS Geant4-based simulation application. Fig. 23 (top) shows the momentum dependence of the muon reconstruction plus identification efficiency for different ATLAS detector upgrade scenarios and 200 PU events. It is apparent that the detector descoping from the Reference scenario to the Low scenario would cost the experiment 10% in muon efficiency. The primary vertex reconstruction efficiency in ATLAS for tt, Z \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 , and Vector Boson Fusion (VBF) H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 events is shown in Fig. 23 (bottom) in the case of 200 PU events. The lesson learned is that vertexing performance does not depend strongly on the tracker layout, and it varies with physics process. While the efficiency does not change for tt, it goes down by 1%(2%) for VBF H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 (Z \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) events when switching from the Reference to the Low scenario.

At the LHC, the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid (WLCG) [51] is used to process, store and analyze the data collected or generated by the experiments. The WLCG is composed of four levels or \"Tiers\": 0, 1, 2, 3. The difference between Tiers is in the services they provide, whether they host raw data, and how well they are interconnected. The Tier 0 is located at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland and at the Wigner Research Centre for Physics in Budapest, Hungary. All data passes through the two Tier 0 sites, which are connected by two dedicated 100 Gbit/s data links and provide less than 20% of the compute capacity. The main role of the Tier 0 is to safe-keep the raw data, perform a first pass reconstruction, reprocess data when the LHC is not running, and distribute the raw and reconstructed data to the Tier 1 centers. The Tier 1 consists of 13 computing centers with large storage capacity distributed all over the world. They are responsible for the safe-keeping of different shares of all raw and reconstructed data, as well as for performing large-scale reprocessing and storing the associated output. The Tier 1 centers distribute data to the Tier 2 centers and store a share of the simulation output produced by the Tier 2's. A dedicated high-bandwidth network, consisting of 10 Gbit/s optical-fiber links, connect CERN to most of the Tier 1 centers around the world. The approximately 160 Tier 2 centers are typically located at research institutions outside CERN and provide data storage capacity and computing power for simulated event production and reconstruction, as well as for data analysis tasks. Tier 3 computing resources are not part of the WLCG and refer to local clusters in universities, other scientific institutes, or even individual PC's, that scientists use to access the WLCG resources.",

In a series of exercises in 2006, 2007, 2008 (Run 1) and 2014 (Run 2), the computing system was stress tested at 25%, 50%, and 100% capacity. In preparation for Run 1, 150 million simulated events were produced, realistic trigger rates were modeled, and reconstruction and physics analysis performed in real time for event samples representing an integrated luminosity   in excess of a quarter of the total delivered in 2010. For illustration, the workflow for the CMS 2008 CSA challenge [52] is shown in Fig. 25. The \"pre-production\" samples are simulated data modeling the real raw data acquired by the detector and filtered by the trigger according to the same physics requirements coded in the actual trigger system. This step was performed in various Tier 0, 1 and 2 computing centers, and the resulting output data copied to the Tier 0 center at CERN, where prompt reconstruction followed. Next, the MC data-sets utilized for calibration and alignment, the \"AlCaReco\" files, were produced and transferred to the CERN Analysis Facility (CAF). Then, the calibration and alignment constants were derived at the CAF and transferred to the conditions database. The data was reprocessed in the Tier 1 center, re-reconstructed as is typical in the experiments to correct mistakes in the first pass.

Typically, trackers are highly segmented to provide efficient particle identification and precise measurements of particle trajectories and momentum in the presence of a magnetic field. In addition, these detectors must be thin and light to minimize interactions before the particles reach the calorimeters. In an ideal detector, electrons, photons, and hadrons would traverse the tracker unperturbed and experience their first destructive interaction and subsequent shower in the calorimeters, the detector components designed to measure energy. In real detectors, most significantly in the case of silicon trackers, particles do interact and disappear (photon conversion) or loose a large fraction of their total energy while traversing the detector material (charged particles). This is a price that most modern experiments are willing to pay in exchange for the more precise position and momentum measurements, faster readout, and better radiation tolerance offered by silicon-based detectors. For example in CMS, photons have a 70% probability to convert into electrons within the silicon tracker volume, a difficult challenge to overcome given the key role that photons play in Higgs measurements (H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3), direct photon strong production studies, and BSM searches. Simulation is a useful tool to understand the impact of tracking detector material on physics measurements, keep the systematic uncertainties under control, and deliver competitive results. The necessary condition is that the tracker materials, shapes, and thicknesses are described with precision in the geometry code, and that photon-nucleus interactions, photon conversions and energy loss, as well as multiple scattering are accurately modeled in Geant4.",

The contribution to the total material of each of the subsystems that comprise the CMS tracker is given separately: the pixel tracker, the strip tracker which consists of the tracker endcap (TEC), the tracker outer barrel (TOB), the tracker inner barrel (TIB), and the tracker inner disks (TID), the support tube that surrounds the tracker, and the beam pipe [53]. Fig. 27 presents the data-to-MC ratio of the fraction of photons undergoing conversions and nuclear interactions as a function of the radial distance (R) from the center of the detector, which is correlated with different sub-detector components. This ratio is computed from data-driven measurements of the conversion and nuclear interaction probabilities respectively, demonstrate agreement between data and MC within 15%, and may be used as scaling factors to correct the MC before using it in physics analysis. Discrepancies observed in Fig. 27 can be directly related to deficiencies in the detector geometry modeling [54].",

Zero-bias refers to a sample of events collected from random proton bunch crossings without any specific trigger requirement. The sub-sample of all muons contained in the zero-bias sample includes the contributions of prompt muons from W and Z decays, muons from heavy flavor decays (b-and c-quarks or \u03c4 -leptons), light hadrons (\u03c0, K) or decays of particles produced in nuclear interactions, and muons from hadrons that penetrate the detector beyond the limits of the calorimeters.

The excellent agreement in the kinematic regions where data and MC are compared, p T = 1 \u2212 20 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.6, is remarkable given that the pixel, tracker, and muon systems are all used in muon reconstruction, involving a diversity of technologies, shapes, and materials, as well as abrupt transitions between sub-detector systems.",

The development and validation of simulation code to model the detector shape, thickness, and materials was therefore an activity of utmost importance. Fig. 29 (top) shows the distribution of photon conversion vertices in the radial direction starting from the detector center [55]. Full circles represent the collider data measurement, while the solid line shows the distribution of conversion candidates obtained using the same analysis method applied to the data. The histogram shows the true MC distribution for the conversions (blue) and the Dalitz decays of neutral mesons (yellow). The good agreement between MC and data, although based on limited statistics, is a measure of the excellent modeling of the material distribution in the MC. A second example of material modeling validation is shown in Fig. 29 (bottom)  [56] and consists of reconstructing particles with well known masses and lifetimes from detector tracks. Flaws in the material modeling of the detector would result in incorrect compensation for effects of energy loss and multiple scattering on the tracks, resulting in biases to the reconstructed tracks momenta, which propagate to the reconstructed mass.

The contribution to the total material of each of the subsystems that comprise the CMS tracker is shown separately. Discrepancies between MC and data can be related directly to deficiencies in the detector geometry modeling of the tracker [54].

The impact parameter has the same sign as the scalar product of the vector pointing from the primary vertex to the point of closest approach with the jet direction. In an ideal detector, tracks originating from the decay of long-lived particles such as b quarks traveling along the jet axis would have positive IP values, while the impact parameters of light-flavor quarks coming from the PV would be still be positive but close to zero. However, in a real detector, both negative and positive values are possible due to resolution effects. While distributions are significantly asymmetric for b-quarks, they are almost symmetric for light quarks, with a deviation towards a small positive mean value due to contributions of secondary vertices from particles decaying within the light jets, such as kaons and lambdas.

Fig. 33 shows the signed transverse impact parameter significance distribution measured in an ATLAS di-jet sample compared to a MC distribution. The overall agreement is good except in the tails of the distribution, which are more difficult to model.  The b-tagging efficiency as a function of the jet p T is shown in Fig 34 for a neural network tagger known by its acronym MV1. As in the case of CMS, the MC derivation of b-tagging efficiencies using data-driven methods is within less than 5% of the equivalent measurement in data, and the difference is accounted for in physics measurements through scale factors computed as the ratio of the values represented by the full circles over those in open squares. Differences between CMS and ATLAS efficiencies when comparing Fig. 32 with Fig. 34 are not relevant because taggers are typically tuned to different efficiency operating points depending on the fake (or mis-tag) rate tolerance for a particular physics measurement. The mis-tag probability for light-parton jets to be mis-identified as b jets is measured from data in the ATLAS and CMS experiments using \"negative taggers\". These inverted tagging algorithms select non-b jets using the same variables and techniques as the b-tagging algorithms. An accurate determination of the mis-tag rate is important because, since the cross section for light jets is much larger than for b jets, even a low rate of \"false positives\" (mis-tagged jets) affects the b-jet sample purity in a significant way. Simulating mis-tag rates is tricky because the contributing jets originate in the tails of the IP distributions, which are not trivial to model. For a mis-tag rate tolerance in the 0.01-0.03 range, CMS reports a p T dependence of the data-to-MC mis-tag rate scale factors of about 20% [57], while ATLAS reports factors of 2-3 for a tolerance in the 0.002-0.005 range [58].

Although simulation is typically not used as the main tool to predict these backgrounds, MC samples are used to design and develop data-driven methods for background estimation and to perform the associated closure tests. For instance, kinematic distributions of final state particles measured in data, inspire physically motivated families of functional forms which also fit well the simulated spectra in both the control and signal regions and are ultimately used to predict the backgrounds in SR's from extrapolations of fits to data in CR's. This is a common practice in many cases where the electroweak (EWK) processes are known to be accurately modeled by physics generators. The use of MC samples to assist on the derivation of EWK backgrounds for final states with high jet multiplicity and heavy-flavor jets is more challenging, because of limitations of the physics generators rather than those of detector modeling. In other words, the standard machinery of the Pythia [59,60] event generator is based on leading-level matrix elements combined with parton showers. From matrix elements calculations, the Mad-Graph [61] event generator produces events based on processes modeled to LO accuracy for any user-defined Lagrangian, and to the NLO accuracy for QCD corrections to SM processes. Matrix elements at the tree-level and one-looplevel can also be generated. Consequently, predictions for final states with high particle multiplicity and heavy-flavors are either inaccurate, or computationally expensive once loop-level calculations are included. Exceptionally, in the case of rare SM processes that contribute sub-dominant backgrounds, such as ttV , ttH, V H in same-sign leptonic BSM searches, backgrounds are predicted directly from MC truth information. The cost of this approach is a large uncertainty on a small fraction of the total background, which ultimately does not affect the sensitivity of the analysis. Fig. 35 describes the kinematics in the transverse plane of Z+jets and \u03b3+jets collider events, which are used to illustrate the data-to-MC agreement of quantities involving gauge boson production. These events consist of either a Z boson decaying to leptons or a \u03b3 recoiling against jets that balance the transverse momentum, q T , of the gauge boson. The total transverse momentum of the hadronic recoil is indicated in Fig. 35 by the vector u T , while u \u22a5 and u are the components perpendicular and parallel to the gauge boson. The E T vector is a measure of the p T imbalance in the event and will be discussed in detail in Sec. 5.2.3. Figure 35: Kinematics of Z+jets and \u03b3+jets events in the transverse plane. The events consist of either a Z decaying to leptons or a \u03b3 recoiling against jets that balance the transverse momentum, q T , of the gauge boson. The total transverse momentum of the hadronic recoil is indicated by the vector u T , while u \u22a5 and u are the components perpendicular and parallel to the gauge boson. The & E T vector is a measure of the p T imbalance in the event. Figs. 36, 37, 38 show the CMS di-lepton (\u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 and e + e \u2212 ) invariant mass distributions for the Z+jets samples, and the q distributions for the Z+jets and \u03b3+jets samples [62]. The full circles correspond to the number of events in the data samples, while the histograms represent the MC predictions for the number of events contributed by all the physics processes with final states passing the selection criteria. The agreement between the data measurements and the MC predictions is excellent, except in the range of q T > 200 GeV for the Z+jets sample, where the MC overestimates the data by a difference that grows linearly with q T .",

Although this term is physically incorrect because energy is a scalar quantity, it is widely used in high-energy particle physics because calorimeters measure energy (not momentum) and, in most events of interest in current collider experiments, particle masses are negligible with respect to their total energy. In this limit of negligible mass, energy equals momentum and missing transverse momentum may be approximated by E T as defined above. Modeling E T is one of the most challenging simulation tasks because this event level quantity depends on accurate simulation of all types of particles, including hadronic showers from jets, as well as unclustered energy not assigned to any particle in the event. Challenging as it is, accurate modeling of E T in simulation is of paramount importance to the quality of BSM searches for SUSY and Extra Dimensions (ED), as well as in collider-based searches for dark matter. Simulation of E T also played a crucial role in the discovery and characterization of the Higgs boson, particularly in the H \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 final state, and channels with a W \u2192 l\u03bd or a Z \u2192 \u03bd\u03bd.",

As a result, these processes contribute significant background to most searches for signals with weakly interacting particles because the latter have a large E T signature, and the W/Z+jets events may have large fake E T .

            "text": "All-jet events resulting from strong production of highly collimated beams of particles are among the most difficult to simulate and so is their associated E T . To model the high-energy tail of the E T distribution of these multi-jet events, the simulation needs to include a high degree of detail in the development and fluctuations of particle showers in the detector, as well as modeling of rare oc-        currences of detector signal processing malfunctions. Consequently, MC-truth predictions of E T distributions are typically not reliable, to the level required in modern collider experiments, to make accurate estimates of the background contributions of these QCD events to measurements of other SM processes and potential BSM signals. The E T simulation challenge in multi-jet events originates in the fact that jets are composed of many particles with energies ranging from a few GeV to hundreds of GeV, which shower into hundreds of more particles as they traverse the detector material. Different models for electromagnetic and nuclear interactions and a careful handling of the model-to-model transitions are required to simulate these showers, depending on the particle type, energy, and material involved. Small changes in the modeling of energy fluctuations translate into large differences in the transverse momentum imbalance observed in multi-jet events, which ranges from mild to severe and result in small to very large fake missing transverse momentum. More examples of backgrounds to SM and BSM measurements with E T are presented below. Backgrounds are irreducible when they come from a physics process that results in a final state indistinguishable from the one for the signal. Reducible backgrounds are those that are distinguishable from the signal due to distinctive physics properties. Irreducible QCD background to tt production occurs for the final state where both top quarks decay hadronically to two b jets plus light jets. In this case, the multi-jet event observed in the detector is indistinguishable from an event with the same light-jet and b-jet multiplicity which originates in the strong production and subsequent hadronization and fragmentation of light quarks, b quarks, and gluons. Instead, when a tt pair decays semi-leptonically, QCD background arises from the measurement process, when jets in the tails of the response distribution cause fake E T that mimics the W \u2192 l\u03bd process in top decays. A SUSY search with all jets in the final state, where events with large E T are selected, is another example of instrumental QCD background. Events in the tails of the jet response distribution, observed in Fig. 12, make large contributions to SUSY SR's due to their large production cross sections. The source and rates of these rare events with extremely large E T are very difficult to identify, evaluate, and eventually simulate.",

Fig. 46 shows the E T distribution for CMS di-jet events before and after applying the software algorithms to remove events with spurious E T [62] . Excellent agreement is observed in the > 500 GeV range, even in the tail of the distribution. Agreement deteriorates below 500 GeV as the contribution of QCD events in the sample increases and eventually becomes dominant. In spite of the excellent agreement observed in the high E T range, data-driven methods are preferred over MC predictions of multi-jet backgrounds with high E T , particularly in searches with a SR in the tail of the E T distribution, and simulation-based closure tests are utilized to demonstrate accuracy. The reason is that it is basically impossible to demonstrate that all sources of spurious events in this region of low statistics have been identified, understood, and modeled in the MC with the correct rates of occurrence. One example of these rare occurrencies is when a high-energy particle hits directly a photo-diode in the detector readout circuit.  Fig. 47 shows the resolution of the CMS particle flow E T projections along the x and y axes as a function of the scalar sum of the transverse energy, \u03a3E T , of all the reconstructed particles in the event, except for the \u03b3 in the \u03b3+jets sample or the leptons from the decay of the Z-boson candidate in the Z+jets sample [62]. E T resolutions in Z+jets events for the e + e \u2212 and \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 decay channels are described in the simulation within a 10% accuracy, well within the statistical and systematic uncertainties of the measurements. A good modeling of the energy resolutions of measured particles and event quantities such as E T is important because small data-to-MC discrepancies would cause a different amount of distribution \"smearing\" and therefore bin-to-bin migration of events. A poor modeling of the resolution smearing effect would render the MC of limited use in physics analysis. Migration effects may be large and are challenging to simulate, particularly in the case of the jet p T spectrum, which reflects the rapidly falling p T dependence of the QCD cross sections for jet production. In this case, the event E T distribution would be significantly affected in a detector with poor energy resolution because low p T jets produced with large cross sections would populate the high E T tail, reducing the purity in the highest E T bins of the distribution.",

            "text": "The example of jet cross sections and QCD jet measurements in general is particularly useful to illustrate the impact of simulation in data measurements because of its dependence on a single dominant source of systematic uncertainty, the jet energy correction, which in turn relies to a large extent on how well the hadronic response and energy resolutions are modeled in the simulation. In particular, the energy response to low-energy hadrons (E = 1 \u2212 10 GeV) is the most difficult to model and affects even high-energy jets given that the energy of the jet constituents grows slowly, approximately as the square root of the jet energy. Figs The goal here is to analyze the impact of simulation in the publication process timeline and the precision of the result. There is an important difference between the comparisons for jet measurements and the rest of the data-to-MC comparisons in this article. While the latter are comparisons between detector-level measured quantities and predicted quantities based on events generated and passed through detector simulation software, the former are comparisons between measured quantities corrected to the particle level and NLO-QCD parton level theoretical predictions which, sometimes, contain non-perturbative hadronization corrections. In the inclusive jet measurements, all detector effects such as jet energy response and resolution smearing have been removed, in average, as part of the analysis procedure. Therefore, theoretical predictions do not need to be passed through detector modeling software in order to be on the same footing for comparison with data. While comparisons in previous sections give information about the quality of the event generators and detector simulation software  tools, the jet cross section comparisons evaluate the accuracy of the QCD theoretical predictions, which depend on the order of the calculation, the choice of factorization and renormalization parameters, and the parton distribution functions (PDFs). The aspect of the jet cross section measurements to highlight in this section is the relationship between the size of the systematic uncertainty (measurement precision), the role of simulation, and the publication timeline (publication turnaround). The capabilities of the detectors as well as the quality of the FullSim and ParSim tools, utilized to either design the data-driven jet correction derivation methods or directly extract the corrections after thorough tuning and validation, dominate the accuracy of the measurements and the publication timeline. Fig. 49 shows the CMS inclusive jet cross section measurements based on the full 34 pb \u22121 data collected in 2010. The data taking period started in March 2010 and the results were published in June 2011, only seven months after the end of the run. The jet cross sections shown in Fig. 50 are based on the full 2010 data set and were published by the ATLAS experiment in April 2012. ATLAS also published an intermediate result [69], based on half the data-set, in October 2010, before the end of the run. The CMS measurement extends up to rapidities of |y| = 3 with uncertainties in the range of 10 \u2212 20% in the most central region and 15 \u2212 30% in the most forward bin. ATLAS measured the jet cross sections up to rapidities of |y| = 4.4 with uncertainties similar to those in the CMS measurement for the central bin and in the 12 \u2212 40% range for the most forward bin. Rapidity is defined as y",

The measurement, shown in Fig. 51, covers only the central pseudorapidity region, 0.1 < |\u03b7| < 0.7, with uncertainties in the 20 \u2212 35% range. D0's first inclusive jet cross section measurement, shown in Fig. 52, was published in 1999, eight years after the start of Run 1. It was based on the full 92 pb \u22121 Run 1b data-set, restricted to the |\u03b7| < 0.5 range, and reported uncertainties in the 10\u221230% range. A few years later, in 2001, D0 extended the Run 1 measurement to the forward pseudorapidity region, up to |\u03b7| = 3 [70]. Both experiments published the Run 2 inclusive jets cross sections, CDF in |\u03b7| < 2.1 (2008) [71], and D0 in a slightly larger, |\u03b7| < 2.4, region (2011) [72]. The reason for the CDF delay in extending the \u03b7 coverage is that the experiment initially tuned the ParSim only for the central calorimeter. The End Plug Calorimeter was not incorporated until a GFLASH based approach was undertaken in 2002-2003. Jet energy calibration in forward regions relies on di-jet balance techniques, which are significantly affected by resolution biases and can be understood in detail only with large and accurate MC samples. In the case of D0, a ParSim approach was not viable due to the absence of a solenoidal magnetic field in the tracker and scarce test beam data. The in situ calibration approach based on data-driven methods applied to collider data had to be developed from scratch and without the aid of large and accurate FullSim samples for studies and closure tests. Consequently, D0 could not deliver a result with competitive systematic uncertainties until 1996,  while CDF published jet cross sections with large uncertainties in 1989 (Run 0) [73] and 1992. The latter was an intermediate Run 1 result based on early data [74].",

As discussed in Sec. 2, CDF used Run 0 data to measure the single-track energy response from minimum bias and track triggers to tune a fast MC. This parametrized simulation approach was preferred during Run 0 and Run 1 over the full GEANT3-based option because the latter was prohibitively slow. In Run 1, D0 did not have a solenoid magnet wrapped around the tracker to measure the momentum of single-charged-particles and tune the simulation. Consequently, the experiment relied purely on in situ measurements of calibration factors and efficiencies using data-driven methods applied to collider events. The process of developing these methods and, eventually, improving and tuning their simulation software  was very lengthy for the experiments because they had to rely on small MC samples, of the order of a few ten to a few hundred thousand events, to develop the techniques and demonstrate their correctness via closure tests. Even with the aid of GEANT3-based simulation software, accuracy was often sacrificed for speed by introducing approximations to the sub-detector shapes, material, or particle shower modeling. The resulting MC samples were only partially useful to develop data-driven techniques, investigate their associated biases, and establish closure. At the LHC, hundreds of millions of fully simulated events were generated using Geant4-based applications even before the start of the first run. Reconstruction algorithms and data-driven methods to derive efficiencies and calibration factors were developed using these MC samples, and performed, basically, as in design specifications on real collider data at start-up. MC truth predictions of calibration curves and physics observables were in such good agreement with data, that they could be used \"out-of-the-box\" almost immediately after start-up, requiring only small corrections and even smaller uncertainties derived from comparisons with results from data-driven methods applied on real collider data.",

(This information was obtained from the CMS Dashboard, which is a computing information monitoring source available to CMS members.) ATLAS's Geant4 module takes approximately seven times more CPU time than CMS's due to the more complex geometry and other factors. In CMS, the rest of the CPU cycles were primarily used to reconstruct and analyze real collider data. The assumption for the 85% figure is that the analysis of simulated data consumes 75% of the CPU time spent in analysis, including both simulated and real data, and excludes the generation of signal samples for BSM searches. The reason why the analysis of simulated data takes a larger fraction of the total analysis CPU time than the analysis of    real collider data is that the design and optimization of the measurements, as well as the development and validation of data-driven methods, are all based on MC samples.",

(This information was obtained from the CMS Dashboard and from private communication with Oliver Gutsche.) These numbers account only for purchasing cost though, and a more realistic estimation may be based on a value of 0.9 US dollar cents per core hour, which is what Fermilab spends on physical hardware including life-cycle, operation and maintenance. (The information was obtained from private communication with Oliver Gutsche.) An alternative estimate is based on the cost of renting the CPU time from industry, at a rate of 1.4 US dollar cents per core hour. (The information was obtained from private communication with Oliver Gutsche.) The 0.9 (1.4) US dollar cents assumption puts the annual cost of simulation for CMS in the range of 3.5-6.2 (5.5-10) million US dollars, half of it spent on executing the Geant4 module. A corollary to this discussion is that improvements of 1%, 10%, and 35% in the time performance of the Geant4 toolkit would render 50-80k, 500-800k, 1.8-2.8M US dollars per year of savings to CMS. Improvements on the order of a 2-5 speed-up factor, as targeted by current R&D efforts (GeantV [78]), would yield savings on the order of 2-4 (3-6) million US dollars per year. An important question, rarely addressed even by modern experiments at the time of detector design and technology selection, is related to the added costs to the detector construction, commissioning, and operations that comes from detector choices that maximize physics output in exchange for expensive and time-consuming simulation and reconstruction operations.",

In principle, reconstruction would take a larger fraction of the computing resources during the HL-LHC era, since the CPU time consumption is predicted to increase exponentially with the number of pile-up events. However, while simulation code is highly optimized and offers few non-revolutionary time performance improvement opportunities, the reconstruction code under development for the upgraded or new HL-LHC sub-detector systems still offers low hanging fruit to exploit, at least in the case of CMS.

Simulation helps physicists to design and optimize detectors for best physics performance, stress-test the computing infrastructure, program data reconstruction algorithms that perform almost as in design specifications at the begining of the experiment run, develop data-driven techniques for calibration and physics analysis, and produce data samples with the properties predicted by many candidate theories to describe currently unexplained physical phenomena.",

According to Ref. [80], the amount of data collected and stored by the LHC experiments through the end of 2013 was of the order of 15 PB/year, not so far from the 180 PB/year uploaded to Facebook, the 98 PB of data in the Google search index, or the 15 PB/year in videos uploaded to YouTube.

Through the end of the 2030's, the experiments expect to collect 150 times more data than in Run 1. The 50 PB of raw data produced in 2016 will grow to approximately 600 PB in 2026 while the CPU needs will increase by a factor of about 60. The exact numbers will depend on the approximations and the loss of information that the experiments are willing to tolerate to keep computing performance within the limits established by the available resources. Thus, the effort to improve the computing performance of the simulation and reconstruction software requires immediate attention, in order to restrain the increasing demand of computing power within the limits of flat budgets. Although transistor density growth is more or less keeping up with Moore's law, doubling every couple of years, clock speed has been flat since approximately 2003. Consequently, solutions must be found elsewhere, leveraging the core count growth in multicore machines, using new generation coprocessors, and re-engineering code under new programming paradigms based on concurrency and parallel programming. Coprocessors, or accelerators, specialize in operations such as floating point math or graphics. A hybrid computing model would allow to share work across a mixture of computers with different architectures. Each processor type could be used to perform different tasks depending on its nature.",

In the specific case of Geant4, the release of the first version with multithreading capability in 2013 allowed significant savings in memory, although not in time performance. For the latter, expert teams are invested in R&D programs to explore the potential of multithread track-level (particle-level) parallelization, improved instruction pipelining, data locality, and vectorization for single instruction multiple data. One example is the GeantV [78] project to develop the next generation detector simulation toolkit, with a goal set to achieve a speedup factor of 2 to 5 with respect to Geant4, while enhancing the physics accuracy of the code and offering fast simulation options that include machine learning techniques for fast and precise tuning.",
