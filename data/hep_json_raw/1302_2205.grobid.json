Searches for B 0 s,d meson decays to dimuons were performed both at the Tevatron and the LHC, where the large datasets of B hadrons provide a unique opportunity to study rare decays. In addition, the rates and angular distributions of b \u2192 s\u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 decay products are also sensitive to new physics. In Section 2 we review the experimental status of the searches for the B 0 s and B 0 rare decays to dimuons at hadron colliders. In Section 3 the angular analysis and measurements of branching ratios for various b \u2192 s\u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 decays performed by the CDF experiment is summarised.",

            "text": "The rare decays B 0 s \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 and B 0 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 are highly suppressed in the SM of particle physics due to their FCNC nature. These decays are forbidden at tree level and can proceed only through higher order diagrams, such as electroweak penguin and box diagrams. Furthermore, the decays are helicity suppressed and require an internal quark annihilation within the B meson. The SM predictions for the B 0 s and B 0 branching ratios to dimuons are (3.23 \u00b1 0.27) \u00d7 10 \u22129 and (1.07 \u00b1 0.10) \u00d7 10 \u221210 , respectively, with the main uncertainty resulting from the value of the B meson decay constant f B [1]. The comparison with experimental results requires the inclusion of soft-photon radiation and B 0 s -B s oscillations effects each yielding O(10%) corrections to the predicted decay rate. Several extensions of the SM, such as supersymmetric models and models with a non-standard Higgs sector, predict enhancements or suppressions to the branching fractions for these rare decays. The rare nature of the processes and the rather precise SM predictions make these decays an excellent probe for physics beyond the SM. a e-mail: vincenzo.chiochia@cern.ch At the LHC searches for the B 0 s and B 0 decays to dimuons were performed by the ATLAS, CMS and LHCb experiments using datasets of pp collisions at center-ofmass energies \u221a s = 7 or 8 TeV collected between 2010 and 2012. The CMS experiment performed a simultaneous search for the rare decays B 0 s \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 and B 0 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 using an integrated luminosity of 5 fb \u22121 collected at the center-of-mass energy \u221a s = 7 TeV [2]. An event-counting experiment was performed in dimuon mass regions around the B 0 s and B 0 masses and all selection criteria were established before observing the signal region. A normalization sample of events with B + \u2192 J/\u03c8K + decays (where J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) was used to remove uncertainties related to the b-quark production cross section and the integrated luminosity. Combinatorial backgrounds were evaluated from the data in dimuon invariant mass sidebands while backgrounds from B decays were assessed with Monte Carlo (MC) simulation. The analysis was performed separately in two channels, barrel and endcap, and then combined for the final result. The barrel channel contained the candidates where both muons have |\u03b7| < 1.4 and the endcap channel included those where at least one muon had |\u03b7| > 1. 4. B\u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 candidates with traverse momentum above 6.5(8.5) GeV in the barrel(endcap) were formed by two oppositely-charged muons originating from a common vertex and with an invariant mass in the range 4.9 < m \u00b5\u00b5 < 5.9 GeV. The (sub)leading muon transverse momentum was required to be larger than (4.0)4.5 GeV in the barrel and (4.2)4.5 GeV in the endcap. Further selection cuts were applied on the B candidate isolation variables, decay length significance and three-dimensional pointing angle.",

The sensitivity to the B 0 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 decay is beyond the reach of the current analysis. Hence only a limit on the B 0 s decay was derived by assuming the B 0 branching ratio to be negligible. The di-muon mass region 5.066 < m \u00b5\u00b5 < 5.666 GeV was removed from the analysis until the procedures for event selection, signal and limit extractions were fully defined. The sample of signal candidates was selected with a multivariate classifier, trained on a fraction of the events from the di-muon invariant-mass sidebands. 14 discriminating variables were used in the selection, including the isolation, decay angle and proper decay length significance, vertex separation, impact parameter of the decay products as well as the B hadron and single muon transverse momenta. Three regions of different mass resolution and hence signal-to-background ratio were defined and selection cuts were optimized indepen-dently. The three categories were defined by the intervals |\u03b7 max | = 0 \u2212 1, 1 \u2212 1.5 and 1.5 \u2212 2.5, where \u03b7 max is the largest pseudorapidity value of the two muons in each event. The width of the search region was set between 116 and 171 MeV and the classifier output threshold between 0.234 and 0.270. The MC validation for the kinematic distributions and classifier output was performed on the normalization channel B + \u2192 J/\u03c8K + and residual discrepancies between data and simulation were treated as systematic uncertainties. The branching ratio was obtained with Eq. 1, where the acceptance and selection efficiencies were extracted from MC simulation. In each mass-resolution category the B 0 s \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 signal yield was obtained from the number of events observed in the search window (see Figure 2), the number of background events in the sidebands, and the small amount of resonant background.

The most stringent constraint is provided by the D0 collaboration, that has fully analyzed the Run II pp dataset corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 10.4 fb \u22121 [9]. The mass resolution is not sufficient to separate the B 0 s and B 0 decays and a search for B 0 s decays was performed assuming no contribution from B 0 . Decay candidates were identified by selecting two high-quality muons of opposite charge forming a three-dimensional vertex well separated from the primary interaction. Backgrounds in the low mass region are dominated by sequential decays b \u2192 c\u00b5X \u2192 \u00b5\u00b5X while on the high mass region double semileptonic decays are dominant. From the peaking backgrounds the B 0 s \u2192KK is the dominant contribution. Oppositely charged muons with p T > 1.5 GeV were selected and a multivariate discriminant was used to differentiate between signal and backgrounds. Two boosted decision trees (BDT) were trained against the two background categories using 30 variables. The optimal BDT output cuts were determined by opti-mizing the expected limit the B 0 s branching ratio and were set to 0.19 and 0.26. The expected number of events in the signal and control regions was determined by applying a log likelihood fit to the dimuon mass distribution using an exponential plus constant functional form. Three events in the signal region were observed after unblinding, which is consistent with expected background. The observed and expected upper limits improve substantially the previous D0 result and are given in Table 1.",

It required high quality muon candidates with transverse momentum p T > 2.0(2.2) GeV in the central (forward) region. The muon pairs were required to have an invariant mass in the range 4.669 < m \u00b5\u00b5 < 5.969 GeV and are constrained to originate from a common well measured three-dimensional vertex. A likelihood method together with a selection based on the track energy loss were used to further suppress contributions from hadrons misidentified as muons. The combinatoric background was estimated by fitting a fixed slope first order polynomial to the mass sidebands while the peaking background from B\u2192 hh decays is evaluated from MC, where the hadron misidentification probabilities were extracted from data. The number of candidates in the B 0 mass window after unblinding are consistent with the background expectations and the corresponding exclusions limits are reported in Table 1. The search in the B 0 s window yielded an excess of events in the region of neural network output \u03bd > 0.97 with a background-only p-value of 0.94%. The combination of all neural network bins has a p-value of 6.8% with respect to a background plus SM-signal hypothesis. The excess is likely a statistical fluctuation of the background as no excess is observed in the last two neural network bins. The corresponding observed and expected exclusion limits obtained with the CL s method are given in Table 1.",

A large part of the parameter space of the supersymmetric models, where tan \u03b2 can be large, is ruled out by the current constraints. While the recent LHCb observation indicates a value of B(B 0 s \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) consistent with the SM, large enhancements of B(B 0 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) are not yet excluded by experimental data. The most stringent exclusion limit to date for this channel is about eight times larger than the SM prediction (at 95% CL). The prospects for further improving the precision on the B s,d branching fractions to dimuons at the LHC are excellent, with the most stringent constraints expected from LHCb and CMS. The LHCb, CMS experiments have collected about 2.1 fb \u22121 and 23 fb \u22121 in 2012, respectively, at the center-of-mass energy \u221a s = 8 TeV. Results based on the analysis of these datasets are expected to be released within 2013. The decay B s ! \u00b5 + \u00b5 is strongly helicity-suppressed in the SM. For this reason, its branching ratio could be strongly enhanced in the presence of NP in the scalar or pseudoscalar operators, which would lift this helicity suppression. A prominent example of a model predicting such enhancement is supersymmetry with large tan and sizable A terms, as motivated e.g. by grand unification.",

To cancel the dominant systematic uncertainties, the decay rates for each rare channel H b \u2192 h\u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 were normalised to the corresponding resonant channel H b \u2192 hJ/\u03c8, where H b can be B + , B 0 , B 0 s and \u039b b , and h stands for K + , K * 0 , \u03c6, K 0 S , K * + , and \u039b. Candidate events were selected by constructing a vertex of two muons that satisfy the trigger requirements with one charged track or with two reconstructed tracks of opposite charge, for the case of charged and neutral h hadrons, respectively. For the normalisation samples the dimuon invariant mass was required to be within 50 MeV of the J/\u03c8 mass. After loose selection cuts the rare decays were tightly selected with a multivariate analysis based on a Neural Network.

In B 0 \u2192 K ( * ) \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 decays the muon forward-backward asymmetry (A FB ) and the K * longitudinal polarisation (F L ) are extracted from the angular distributions cos \u03b8 \u00b5 and cos \u03b8 K , respectively, where \u03b8 \u00b5 is the angle between the \u00b5 + direction and the opposite of the B meson direction in the dimuon rest frame, while \u03b8 K is the angle between the kaon direction and the direction opposite to the B meson in the K * rest frame.
