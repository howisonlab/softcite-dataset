The analysis is based on data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.1 fb \u22121 collected with the CMS detector at the LHC. For events with at least one observed jet, the angular separation between the J/ \u03c8 meson and the jet is used to test whether the J/ \u03c8 meson is part of the jet. The analysis shows that most prompt J/ \u03c8 mesons having energy above 15 GeV and rapidity |y| < 1 are contained in jets with pseudorapidity |\u03b7 jet | < 1. The differential distributions of the probability to have a J/ \u03c8 meson contained in a jet as a function of jet energy for a fixed J/ \u03c8 energy fraction are compared to a theoretical model using the fragmenting jet function approach. The data agree best with fragmenting jet function calculations that use a long-distance matrix element parameter set in which prompt J/ \u03c8 mesons are predicted to be unpolarized. This technique demonstrates a new way to test predictions for prompt J/ \u03c8 production using nonrelativistic quantum chromodynamics.",

            "text": "The mechanism for producing J/\u03c8 mesons as bound states of charm quark pairs (cc) in hadronic collisions has been under intensive experimental and theoretical study since the 1974 discovery of the J/\u03c8 meson in proton-nucleon collisions [1] and in e + e \u2212 annihilations [2]. The early theoretical descriptions of the hadronic production process considering only color-singlet production [3,4] were at odds with the differential cross section measurements as a function of the J/\u03c8 transverse momentum p J/\u03c8 T made by experimenters at the Fermilab Tevatron [5] for p J/\u03c8 T > 6 GeV. A new theoretical approach, nonrelativistic quantum chromodynamics (NRQCD), was used to address the problem [6][7][8]. The NRQCD model includes both color-singlet and color-octet amplitudes for the cc system that ultimately produces the J/\u03c8 meson. It proved to be capable of explaining the cross section data, using phenomenological parameters called long-distance matrix elements (LDMEs) that are adjusted to describe J/\u03c8 meson production data. Within the NRQCD factorization assumption, the LDME parameters are process independent. However, each determination of an LDME set can choose a specific collection of J/\u03c8 meson production data and J/\u03c8 meson kinematic requirements. Furthermore, different LDME sets that describe the production data may have different predictions for the J/\u03c8 meson polarization [9]. Experiments [10,11] E-mail address: cms -publication -committee -chair @cern .ch. have shown that the prompt J/\u03c8 meson polarization at large p J/\u03c8 T (>12 GeV) is small. Recent NRQCD studies extend the range of experimental input to include low-p T data and attempt to make global fits to the full set of charmonium information. A review of these studies can be found in Ref. [12].",

The second level, known as the high-level trigger (HLT), consists of a farm of processors running a version of the full event reconstruction software optimized for fast processing. This reduces the event rate to around 1 kHz before data storage.

Combinatorial candidates are accidental pairings of an identified \u03bc + and a \u03bc \u2212 such that the dimuon invariant mass falls within the signal mass interval. The nonprompt background is strongly reduced by applying a selection on the variable TD , which is the sum of the squares of the significance (in units of standard deviations) of the transverse distance of closest approach of each muon track to the primary vertex. The TD distribution has a sharp peak near zero from prompt events and a long tail at larger TD from nonprompt sources, which we fit with an exponential function. From a prompt J/\u03c8 meson Monte Carlo (MC) sample, we find that >99% of the events have TD < 10. The simulated T D shape agrees with that in data for this region, so we require TD < 10 to define the prompt dimuon events. In the J/\u03c8 data, the exponential function that describes the nonprompt background is extrapolated into the range T D < 10 to estimate the fraction of nonprompt events in the prompt signal mass range. This is (5.7 \u00b1 0.1)%. The events in the prompt signal mass range also contain combinatorial background, which is determined by interpolating the m \u03bc\u03bc low (2.70-2.90 GeV) and high (3.25-3.50 GeV) sideband regions. We find that the combinatorial background fraction in the prompt signal mass range is (1.4 \u00b1 0.2)%. The quoted uncertainties in the backgrounds are statistical only. All distributions shown in this Letter have the nonprompt and combinatorial backgrounds subtracted. After background subtraction, there are 1.63 \u00d7 10 6 prompt J/\u03c8 meson candidates.",

The procedure uses an input generator-level jet energy distribution (truth distribution) derived from pythia light-quark or gluon jets. Simulation shows that for measured jet energy E jet > 44 GeV, the jet reconstruction efficiency exceeds 98.5% and is consistent with being energy independent. Thus, 44 GeV is the lowest jet energy considered in the unfolding procedure. The unfolding procedure uses the CMS jet energy resolution and jet finding efficiency [27] to determine the unfolded jet energy matrix and the MISS matrix. The latter is filled for events that fail the jet efficiency test or fall outside the unfolded jet energy window 44-140 GeV. The method was validated using several different simulated jet energy input truth distributions, including a fit to the pythia shape using the sum of exponentials and the raw data itself in a bootstrap approach. There was no change in the unfolded distributions that exceeded \u03c3 stat /4 for any jet energy bin. Based on unfolding studies in simulation that used three to six iterations, we found that four unfolding iterations gave stable matches to the simulation events and showed no sensitivity to different choices for the input truth distribution. Based on the simulation results, the unfolded jet energy range is 56 < E jet < 120 GeV. This range is stable when the input distribution is changed. Henceforth, E jet will refer to the unfolded quantity, unless otherwise noted.",

The systematic uncertainty in the jet energy scale is small compared to the jet energy resolution used in the unfolding. Varying the jet energy by the jet energy scale systematic (< 2.2%) uncertainty before the unfolding made no change in the results. The CMS studies at \u221a s = 8 TeV using a tag-and-probe method [22,23] show that, for the offline requirements used in this analysis, the ratio of the single-muon efficiency in data and MC simulation is consistent with unity within <3%, independent of p \u03bc T [40]. The tracking efficiency in data and simulation agree to within 1% per track. The dimuon vertex and trigger simulation also have 1% systematic uncertainties. The dimuon HLT trigger inefficiency varies with p J/\u03c8 T in the range 4.5-7.5%. For the few dimuons with p T > 60 GeV, it can go up to 15%. The difference between unity (no loss) and the simulated HLT trigger efficiency is assigned as the HLT systematic uncertainty for each event. All of the above systematic uncertainties are added in quadrature to determine the total systematic uncertainty in the weight for each event. To estimate the impact of the weight systematic uncertainty on the (E jet ; z 1 ) function, two additional (E jet ; z 1 ) functions are made for each z 1 .",

Fig. 2 shows the normalized jet energy distributions for the data and the FJF total cross section predictions for each LDME set Table 1 The \u03c7 2 value and the associated p-value (in parentheses) for 7 degrees of freedom from the comparison of the data and the predictions for the total FJF cross section shape at z 1 = 0.425, 0.525, and 0.625, using the BCKL, the BK, and the Chao LDME parameter sets.  [30,41,42] have normalization uncertainties, as shown in Ref. [16]. The FJF calculations give the ratio of the cross section in a small-z region to the cross section integral over a wide z range. The uncertainty in the predicted FJF values due to the theory normalization uncertainty is almost completely correlated for the numerator and denominator of the ratio. The resulting theoretical uncertainty is negligible compared to the experimental uncertainty in the (E jet ; z 1 ) values. We therefore ignore it in computing the \u03c7 2 values to match data and theory. The \u03c7 2 value and the associated p-value for comparison of data to each LDME set are given in Table 1. An a priori decision was made that a model prediction is an acceptable match to the data only if the \u03c7 2 p-value is larger than 0.1% for seven degrees of freedom. Otherwise, we say that the model does not match the data. For all three z 1 ranges, the FJF predictions using the BCKL LDME parameters match data. Neither the BK nor the Chao LDME parameter sets describe these jet + constituent J/\u03c8 data for any z 1 value. The observation that these new data on J/\u03c8 meson production as constituents of jets match the FJF predictions for the BCKL LDME parameter set and reject two others validates the FJF ap-proach to treating jets as a major source of J/\u03c8 production in the gluon-rich central region in pp interactions. It also demonstrates that the BCKL LDME parameter set can describe new features of J/\u03c8 hadronic production at large p J/\u03c8 T . The BCKL LDME parameters were developed from a completely different data set than these J/\u03c8 + jet data, so there is no a priori reason to expect them to have predicted these measurements. The BCKL parameters are known to predict small J/\u03c8 polarization [30], in agreement with experiment [10,11] for the range of p J/\u03c8 T values selected in this analysis . Because this analysis studies only high-p T J/\u03c8 meson production and shows that the BCKL LDME parameters describe the process and other sets do not, it suggests a tension between high-p T J/\u03c8 results and global charmonium studies [12].",

The model prediction for the number of zero-jet events using the 20 GeV z probability calculation differs by 3% from the 50 GeV result. This difference is taken as the systematic uncertainty in the z fragmentation probability. The uncertainty in the MC prediction of the low-energy jet efficiency is 13%. We also made a closure test by using the model to predict the number of observed jets lost when the jet p T threshold was raised from 25 to 40 GeV. The model prediction agrees with the actual number of lost jets to within (3.5 \u00b1 0.1)%. However, there is a jet energy dependence in the matching between the data and the prediction. Extrapolating the bin-by-bin jet energy dependence of that difference into the 19-44 GeV range, the closure study gives a 7% systematic uncertainty in the predicted number of zero-jet events having jet energies less than 44 GeV. Adding the systematic uncertainties in quadrature, the predicted fraction of zero-jet events with a J/\u03c8 meson as a constituent of a jet with p jet T < 25 GeV is (43 \u00b1 3 (stat) \u00b1 7 (syst))%.",

This increases the fraction of J/\u03c8 mesons that are constituents of a jet in the one-jet sample from (84.0 \u00b1 0.1)% to (94.3 \u00b1 0.1)%. With this interpretation, and the results from Section 5, we find that the one-and two-jet fractions for a jet to have a constituent J/\u03c8 meson are both essentially 94%. The overall fraction of J/\u03c8 mesons that come from jets is, then, 0.94\u202245% = 42% from events with one or more observed jets, plus 43% from the zero-jet sample. While the zero-jet model is simple, it passes an experimental closure test. Also, it follows the trend of the data as the jet p T requirement is raised in steps from 25 to 40 GeV. Using it, we conclude that (85 \u00b1 3 (stat) \u00b1 7 (syst))% of the J/\u03c8 mesons within our kinematic acceptance, E J/\u03c8 > 15 GeV and |y J/\u03c8 | < 1, are constituents of jets with E jet > 19 GeV and |\u03b7 jet | < 1.",

The term prompt means that the J/\u03c8 meson is consistent with originating from the primary vertex. In the FJF model, the jet fragments into a cc system in an angular momentum state and quark color configuration 2S+1 L n J , plus other hadrons. Here, S, L, and J are the spin, orbital, and total angular momentum quantum numbers of the cc system and n indicates a color-singlet (n = 1) or color-octet (n = 8) configuration. The FJF analysis uses the nonrelativistic quantum chromodynamics (NRQCD) approach to compute the cross section for the formation of a J/\u03c8 meson from the cc system for four specific S, J , L, and n configurations: requirement, we find that jets are the source of (85 \u00b1 3 (stat) \u00b1 7 (syst))% of the J/\u03c8 mesons produced in the kinematic region probed in this study. Interpreting the results in the framework of the FJF model, jet fragmentation accounts for almost all prompt J/\u03c8 mesons produced at large p J/\u03c8 T . The data are consistent with an NRQCD treatment of the FJF process using the BCKL parameter set.",

The kinematic selections for the analy-sis are E J/\u03c8 > 15 GeV, |y J/\u03c8 | < 1, p jet T >25 GeV, and |\u03b7 jet | < 1. In z ranges 0.40-0.45, 0.50-0.55, and 0.60-0.65, where z is the J/\u03c8 meson fraction of the jet energy, the shape of the masured differential cross section as a function of E jet for J/\u03c8 meson production as a jet constituent is compared to the FJF prediction for this quantity, using three different long-distance matrix element (LDME) parameter sets. The FJF predictions using the Bodwin, Chung, Kim, and Lee (BCKL)[30]  LDME parameters match the data for all three z ranges. In contrast, the FJF predictions for the LDME parameter sets from Butenschoen and Kniehl (BK)[41] and Chao, et al.,(Chao)  [42]  disagree with the data for all three z ranges. This establishes the ability of the FJF analysis to describe J/\u03c8 meson production from central gluonic jets and the ability of this kind of experiment to distinguish among different sets of LDME parameters, all of which describe inclusive J/\u03c8 meson production for their choice of data.",
