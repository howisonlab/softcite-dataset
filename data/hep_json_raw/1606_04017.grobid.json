            "text": "The production of W \u00b1 Z pairs in hadron collisions is an important test of the electroweak sector of the Standard Model (SM). The W \u00b1 Z final states arise from two vector bosons radiated by quarks or from the decay of a virtual W boson into a W \u00b1 Z pair, which involves a triple gauge coupling (TGC). In addition, W \u00b1 Z pairs can be produced in vector-boson scattering processes, which involve triple and quartic gauge couplings (QGC) and are sensitive to the electroweak symmetry breaking sector of the SM. New physics could manifest in W \u00b1 Z final states as a modification of the TGC and QGC strength. Precise knowledge of the W \u00b1 Z production cross section is therefore necessary in the search for new physics.",

            "text": "Measurements of the W \u00b1 Z production cross section in protonantiproton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of \u221a s = 1.96 TeV were published by the CDF and D0 Collaborations [1,2]  ATLAS experiment at the LHC, and corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 3.2 fb \u22121 . The W and Z bosons are reconstructed using their decay modes into electrons or muons. The inclusive production cross section is measured in a fiducial phase space and extrapolated to the total phase space. This Letter also reports the ratio of the cross sections at 13 TeV and 8 TeV [4], as well as the ratio of the W + Z /W \u2212 Z cross sections, which is sensitive to the parton distribution functions (PDF). Finally, the production cross section is also measured as a function of the jet multiplicity. This distribution provides an important test of perturbative quantum chromodynamics (QCD) for diboson production processes. The W \u00b1 Z diboson process is particularly well suited for this measurement, since the W W final state has a very large background from top-quark production when associated jets are present, and the Z Z final state has substantially fewer events. The reported measurements are compared with the SM cross-section predictions at the next-to-leading order (NLO) in QCD [5,6] and the total cross section is also compared to a very recent calculation at next-tonext-to-leading order (NNLO) in QCD [7].",

The production of W \u00b1 Z pairs and the subsequent leptonic decays of the vector bosons are generated at NLO in QCD using the Powheg-Box v2 [22][23][24][25] generator, interfaced to the Pythia 8.210 parton shower model using the AZNLO [26] set of tuned parameters. The CT10 [27] PDF set is used for the hardscattering process, while the CTEQ6L1 [28] PDF set is used for the parton shower. The jet multiplicity measurement is also compared to the theoretical NLO prediction from the Sherpa 2.1.1 generator [29], calculated using the CT10 PDF set in conjunction with a dedicated set of tuned parameters for the parton shower developed by the Sherpa authors [30].",

To enrich the sample in Z + j and Z \u03b3 events, the m W T requirement is reversed and the missing transverse momentum is required to be less than 40 GeV. The fake factor is calculated as the ratio of the number of events with a tight third lepton to the number of events with a loose third lepton. The dominant contribution (>97%) to the denominator of the fake-factor ratio originates from Z + j and Z \u03b3 events. Simulation shows that the relative fractions of these two processes are similar in this region and the Z control sample where the fake factor is applied, justifying the use of a single fake factor to describe both backgrounds. Processes with at least three prompt leptons contaminate the events in the numerator of the ratio, particularly at high lepton p T , and are subtracted as described for the Z control sample. The fake factor is computed in bins of p T of the lepton not associated with the Z boson, separately for muons and electrons, and considering the different selection criteria used for leptons in the analysis.

The number of qq \u2192 Z Z events predicted by Powheg is scaled by 1.08 to account for NNLO QCD and NLO EW corrections [45][46][47]. The number of gg \u2192 Z Z events predicted by the Sherpa MC event sample is scaled by a factor of 1.52 to account for NLO QCD corrections [48]. These estimates are validated by comparing the MC predictions with the observed event yield, and the distributions of several kinematic variables, in a four-lepton data sample enriched in Z Z events. The number of observed events in this validation region is 106, with 89% purity for the Z Z process. Overall agreement between the data and the predictions is within one standard deviation of the experimental uncertainty. The shapes of the distributions of the main kinematic variables are also found to be well described by the MC predictions. Table 1 summarises the predicted and observed numbers of events together with the estimated background contributions.

The uncertainties in the jet energy scale are obtained from \u221a s = 13 TeV simulations and in situ measurements, similar to the ones described in Ref. [43]. The uncertainty in the jet energy resolution is derived by extrapolating measurements in Run-1 data to \u221a s = 13 TeV. The uncertainty in the E miss T is estimated by propagating the uncertainties in the transverse momenta of hard physics objects and by applying momentum scale and resolution uncertainties to the track-based soft term. The uncertainty associated with pile-up modelling is of the order of 1% and can reach up to 2.9% in the 0-jet bin of the unfolded jet multiplicity distribution. For the measurements of the W charge-dependent cross sections, an uncertainty arising from the charge misidentification of leptons is also considered. It affects only electrons and leads to an uncertainty of less than 0.05% in the ratio of W + Z to W \u2212 Z integrated cross sections determined by combining the four decay channels.",
