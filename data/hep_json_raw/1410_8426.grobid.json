At the 90% confidence level, the upper limits are determined to be B(J/\u03c8 \u2192 D \u2212 s e + \u03bde + c.c.) < 1.3 \u00d7 10 \u22126 and B(J/\u03c8 \u2192 D * s \u2212 e + \u03bde + c.c.) < 1.8 \u00d7 10 \u22126 , respectively.

How-ever, the J/\u03c8 can decay into a single charmed meson via the weak interaction [1]. Weak decays of the J/\u03c8 are rare processes, and the inclusive branching fractions of J/\u03c8 decays to single D or D s mesons are predicted to be of the order of 10 \u22128 or less [2] in the Standard Model (SM). s l\u03bd branching fractions to be \u2243 10 \u221210 by using quantum chromodynamics (QCD) sum rules and employing the covariant light-front quark model [3]. However, as mentioned in Refs. [4][5][6][7], the branching fractions of J/\u03c8 \u2192 D(D)X (with X denoting any hadrons) could be enhanced when new interaction couplings are considered, such as in the top-color models, the Minimal Supersymmetric SM with R-parity violation, or the two-Higgsdoublet model. It is interesting to note that the ratio between J/\u03c8 \u2192 D * s l\u03bd and D s l\u03bd is predicted to be 1.5 \u223c 3.1 in Ref. [2,3], where part of the theoretical uncertainties cancel.",

The cylindrical core of the BESIII detector consists of a helium-based main drift chamber (MDC), a plastic scintillator time-of-flight system (TOF), and a CsI (Tl) electromagnetic calorimeter (EMC), which are all enclosed in a superconducting solenoidal magnet providing a 1.0 T magnetic field. The solenoid is supported by an octagonal flux-return yoke with modules of resistive plate muon counters interleaved with steel. The acceptance for charged particles and photons is 93% over a 4\u03c0 solid angle. The momentum resolution for a charged particle at 1 GeV/c is 0.5%, and the ionization energy loss per unit path-length (dE/dx) resolution is 6%.

Since the resolution of the reconstructed D \u2212 s mass is different for each decay mode, the invariant mass of D \u2212 s candidates is required to be in different mass windows, which are taken as three times the respective resolution (\u00b13\u03c3 around its central value). s or D * \u2212 s candidates are allowed in one event. According to the MC simulations, after all selection criteria are applied, events with multiple candidates occur in about 0.1% cases for each mode in J/\u03c8 \u2192 D \u2212 s e + \u03bd e and about 0.2% for each mode in J/\u03c8 \u2192 D * \u2212 s e + \u03bd e . For real data, only a few events are observed and no events with multiple candidates are found, so the effect of the multiplicity of candidates can be safely ignored.",

This new N up total distribution can be described by a Gaussian function too, then a sum of the mean value (N up total ) and one standard deviation (\u03c3 total ) of this Gaussian function is quoted as the N up \u2032 total . All the numerical results are summarized in Table IV. V. SUMMARY With a sample of 2.25 \u00d7 10 8 J/\u03c8 events collected with the BESIII detector, we have searched for the weak decays J/\u03c8 \u2192 D \u2212 s e + \u03bd e and J/\u03c8 \u2192 D * s \u2212 e + \u03bd e . No significant excess of signal is observed. At the 90% C.L., the upper limits of the branching fractions are: B(J/\u03c8 \u2192 D \u2212 s e + \u03bd e + c.c.) < 1.3 \u00d7 10 \u22126 and B(J/\u03c8 \u2192 D * s \u2212 e + \u03bd e + c.c.) < 1.8 \u00d7 10 \u22126 . The upper limit on the branching fraction B(J/\u03c8 \u2192 D * \u2212 s e + \u03bd e +c.c.) is set for the first time and the upper limit on the branching fraction B(J/\u03c8 \u2192 D \u2212 s e + \u03bd e + c.c.) is 30 times more strict than the previously result [16]. The results are within the SM prediction, but more data will be helpful to test the branching fraction of semileptonic decays of the J/\u03c8 to the order of 10 \u22128 . The results would also be applied to constrain the parameter spaces of some BSM models if direct calculations of these processes are carried out in the future.",
