We find no evidence of B \u00fe \u2192 e \u00fe \u03bd e and B \u00fe \u2192 \u03bc \u00fe \u03bd \u03bc processes. We set the upper limits of the branching fraction at B\u00f0B \u00fe \u2192 e \u00fe \u03bd e \u00de < 3.5 \u00d7 10 \u22126 and B\u00f0B \u00fe \u2192 \u03bc \u00fe \u03bd \u03bc \u00de < 2.7 \u00d7 10 \u22126 at 90% C.L., which are by far the most stringent limits obtained with the hadronic tagging method. Given the low background level demonstrated in this search, we expect more stringent constraints on the new physics models to be set by Belle II [27], the next generation B factory experiment.

The points with error bars are the experimental data. The solid histograms are for the signal MC distributions which are scaled up by a factor of 10 6 (40) from the SM expectation for B \u00fe \u2192 e \u00fe \u03bd e (B \u00fe \u2192 \u03bc \u00fe \u03bd \u03bc ). The dashed (blue) curves show the background PDF fitted in the sideband region (2.0 GeV=c < p B l < 2.5 GeV=c).
