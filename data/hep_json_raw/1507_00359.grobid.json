The data correspond to an integrated luminosity of up to 19.4 fb \u22121 collected with the CMS detector at the LHC. Higgs bosons produced in gluon-gluon fusion and in association with a Z boson are investigated, using models in which the Higgs boson decays into a gravitino and a neutralino or a pair of neutralinos, followed by the decay of the neutralino to a gravitino and a photon. The selected events are consistent with the background-only hypothesis, and limits are placed on the product of cross sections and branching fractions. Assuming a standard model Higgs boson production cross section, a 95% confidence level upper limit is set on the branching fraction of a 125 GeV Higgs boson decaying into undetectable particles and one or two isolated photons as a function of the neutralino mass. For this class of models and neutralino masses from 1 to 120 GeV an upper limit in the range of 7 to 13% is obtained. Further results are given as a function of the neutralino lifetime, and also for a range of Higgs boson masses.",

The same discussion can be applied to heavy neutral Higgs bosons with masses larger than 125 GeV.

In that program, CMS recorded additional data with relaxed trigger requirements, planning for a delayed offline reconstruction in 2013 after the completion of the LHC Run 1. For the search for Higgs bosons produced in ZH, collision events were collected using single-electron and single-muon triggers which require the presence of an isolated lepton with p T in excess of 27 GeV and 24 GeV, respectively. Also a dilepton trigger was used, requiring two leptons with p T thresholds of 17 GeV and 8 GeV. The luminosity integrated with these triggers at at leading-order (LO), the gg \u2192 W + W \u2212 process is generated with the LO event generator gg2ww 3.1 [23], and the tt and tW processes are generated with powheg 1.0 at next-to-leading-order (NLO). The signal samples are also produced with MadGraph. The cross sections at NLO or higher orders if available are used for a given process to renormalize the MC event generators. All processes are interfaced to the pythia 6.4 generator [24] for parton shower and hadronization. The CTEQ6L set of parton distribution functions (PDF) [25] is used for LO generators, while the CT10 [26] PDF set is used for NLO generators. For all processes, the detector response is simulated with a detailed description of the CMS detector, based on the Geant4 package [27]. Additional pp interactions overlapping the event of interest in data, denoted as pileup events, are accounted for by simulating pp interactions with the pythia generator and adding them to each MC sample. The MC samples are tuned to reproduce the distribution in the number of pileup events in data. The average number of pileup events is about 26 for the collected data used in the ggH channel, and is about 21 for the collected data used in the ZH channel.",

The MC normalization of this background is corrected using control samples in data for two event classes, events without jets and those with one or more jets. The control samples in data are obtained using events collected with a prescaled single-photon trigger and with the E miss T requirement reversed to ensure orthogonality to the signal phase space, where the contamination from other processes is minimal. Multiplicative correction factors (C ) are obtained after normalizing the event yield in the simulation to match the data in the control region, separately for events with no jets (C = 1.7) and one or more jets (C = 1.1). These correction factors are used to normalize the simulated \u03b3 + jet event yield in the signal region. An uncertainty of 16% is obtained for these correction factors based on the difference between the corrected and uncorrected simulation and the relative fraction of no jet events (about 10% of the events in the control region) and one or more jet events. The background processes Z\u03b3 \u2192 \u03b3 and W \u2192 \u03bc\u03bd contribute only a small fraction of the total background prediction, due to the lepton veto applied at the preselection stage, and are modeled using simulated samples.",

The data correspond to an integrated luminosity of up to 19.4 fb \u22121 collected with the CMS detector at the LHC. Higgs bosons produced in gluon-gluon fusion or in association with a Z boson are investigated. Models including Higgs boson decays into a gravitino and a neutralino or a pair of neutralinos, followed by the neutralino decay to a gravitino and a photon, are tested. The measurements for the selected events in data are consistent with the background-only hypothesis, and the results are interpreted as limits on the product of cross sections and branching fractions. Assuming a standard model Higgs production cross section, a 95% CL upper limit is set on the branching fraction of a 125 GeV Higgs boson decaying into undetectable particles and one or two isolated photons as a function of the neutralino mass. For neutralino masses from 1 to 120 GeV an upper limit in the range of 7 to 13% is obtained. Further results are given as a function of the neutralino lifetime, and also for a range of Higgs boson masses.",
