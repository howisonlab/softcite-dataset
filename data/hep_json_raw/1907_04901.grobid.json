The signal searched for was the elastic scattering of dark matter particles off nucleons in the detector mineral oil, with neutrinos being an irreducible background. A review of the experiment, its analysis methods, its results and future perspectives are summarized, demonstrating that beam dump experiments provide a novel and promising approach to dark matter searches.

There are only three renormalizable versions of the so called portal models connecting the dark sector to the SM that are constrained by the SM symmetries, differing on the type of mediator particle considered: the vector portal (vector mediator), the Higgs portal (scalar mediator), and the neutrino portal (fermion mediator). Vector portal models are often considered among the most viable for thermal sub-GeV DM. Accelerator beam dump experiments [3] are powerful probes to explore this theoreically well motivated idea.",
