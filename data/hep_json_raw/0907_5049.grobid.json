            "text": "Measurements at RHIC have established the creation of a Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) in most central heavy-ion collisions. An important tool to understand properties of the QGP is study of the spectral shapes of low-mass vector mesons (LVM's), \u03c1, \u03c9 and \u03c6, which can be modified in the medium by partial restoration of chiral symmetry. This modification may be accessed directly by measuring low-momentum LVM's via their decays into lepton pairs inside the hot matter. Since leptons are not subject to the strong interaction, they do not rescatter on their way out of the medium. The PHENIX experiment at RHIC has measured LVM production at midrapidity in p+p, d+Au and Au+Au collisions at \u221a s NN = 200 GeV. Mass peaks for the LVM's have been observed in the di-electron invariant mass spectra with a resolution of 10 MeV/c 2 in all of the three collision systems. The extracted spectra, mass and width of \u03c9 and \u03c6 in p+p, d+Au and Au+Au, in the leptonic and hadronic decay channels are reviewed. As the widths of the mesons may be affected in the medium, the branching ratios of various decay modes may also be modified from the values in vacuum. The relative branching ratio is compared between \u03c6 \u2192 e + e \u2212 and \u03c6 \u2192 K + K \u2212 , which may be sensitive to the mass modification due to the small Q-value of \u03c6 \u2192 K + K \u2212 .",

            "text": "LVM's have both leptonic and hadronic decay channels. The hadronic decay channels have an advantage of larger branching ratios. However, hadrons from deep within the hot matter are scattered by the strong force, thereby loosing information of the original decay. On the other hand, as leptons are not subject to the strong interaction, leptonic probes can carry information of the vector mesons in medium. The most straight-forward and direct method to detect the mass modification is line-shape analysis on invariant mass spectra of daughter leptons of the LVM's. KEK E325 collaboration has reported an excess on the lighter side of the LVM peaks on e + e \u2212 invariant mass spectra [6]. However, this line-shape analysis needs high statistics, which is difficult to collect at collider experiments. Another interesting probe is the decay branch of \u03c6 \u2192 K + K \u2212 to \u03c6 \u2192 e + e \u2212 . Due to the small Q-value of \u03c6 \u2192 K + K \u2212 /K 0 K 0 , the decay branch of \u03c6 may be sensitive to the in-medium mass modification. Some models predict that mass of \u03c6 can be modified to be lighter than mass of a pair of kaons in hot and/or dense medium [7], in which extreme case, \u03c6 cannot decay into a kaon pair.",

Kaons are identified by the time of flight information measured by ToF counters (Full-PID method). For higher p T kaons, the \u03c6 can be also reconstructed without kaon identification (no-PID method).

The production is consistent with each other in the both decay channels, and agree with the N coll scaling. These systematic measurement methods for the LVM's are highly established in PHENIX. A higher statistics run with a HBD detector, which has a capability to reject the \u03c0 0 dalitz background, will enable measurements in central Au+Au collisions and is planned at the end of this year.
