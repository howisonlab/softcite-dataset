A novel strategy has been developed for a combined search for quarks of the up and down type in decay channels with at least one isolated muon or electron. Limits on the mass of the fourth-generation quarks and the relevant Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix elements are derived in the context of a simple extension of the standard model with a sequential fourth generation of fermions. The existence of mass-degenerate fourth-generation quarks with masses below 685 GeV is excluded at 95% confidence level for minimal off-diagonal mixing between the third-and the fourth-generation quarks. With a mass difference of 25 GeV between the quark masses, the obtained limit on the masses of the fourth-generation quarks shifts by about AE20 GeV. These results significantly reduce the allowed parameter space for a fourth generation of fermions.",

The possibility of a fourth generation of fermions has not been excluded, although it is strongly constrained by precision measurements of electroweak observables. These observables are mainly influenced by the mass differences between the fourth-generation leptons or quarks. In particular, scenarios with a mass difference between the fourth-generation quarks smaller than the mass of the W boson are preferred, and even fourth-generation quarks with degenerate masses are allowed [2,3].",

The most stringent limits exclude the existence of a down-type (up-type) fourthgeneration quark with a mass below 611 (570) GeV [14,15]. These limits on the quark mass values enter a region where the coupling of fourth-generation quarks to the Higgs field becomes large and perturbative calculations for the weak interaction start to fail, assuming the absence of other phenomena beyond the standard model [16]. To increase the sensitivity and to use a consistent approach while searching for a new generation of quarks, we have developed a simultaneous search for the up-type and downtype fourth-generation quarks, based on both the electroweak and strong production mechanisms.",

Electron candidates in the transition region between electromagnetic calorimeter barrel and end cap (1:44 < jj < 1:57) are excluded because the reconstruction of an electron object in this region is not optimal. We require a missing transverse momentum 6 E T of at least 40 GeV. The 6 E T is calculated as the absolute value of the vector sum of the p T of all reconstructed objects. Jets are required to have a p T > 30 GeV. The jet energies are corrected to establish a uniform response of the calorimeter in and a calibrated absolute response in p T .

The POWHEG and MADGRAPH generators are interfaced with PYTHIA for the decay of the particles as well as the hadronization and the implementation of a CMS custom underlying event tuning (tune Z2) [27]. The matching of the matrix-element partons to the parton showers is obtained using the MLM matching algorithm [28]. The CTEQ6L1 leading-order (LO) parton distributions are used in the event generation [29]. The generated events are passed through the CMS detector simulation based on GEANT4 [30], and then processed by the same reconstruction software as the collision data. The simulated events are reweighted to match the observed distribution of the number of simultaneous proton interactions. For the full data set collected in 2011, we observe on average about nine interactions in each event. We smear the jet energies in the simulation to match the resolutions measured with data [31]. At least one of the jets within the tracker acceptance (jj < 2:4) needs to be identified as a b jet. For the b-jet identification, we require the signed impact parameter significance of the third track in the jet (sorted by decreasing significance) to be larger than a value chosen such that the probability for a light quark jet to be misidentified as a b jet is about 1%. We apply scale factors measured from data to the simulated events to take into account the different b-jet efficiency and the different probability that a light quark or gluon is identified as a b jet in data and simulation [32].",

We divide the selected single-lepton events into different subsamples according to the signal final states. Therefore, we define a procedure to count the number of W-boson candidates. Each event has at least one W boson that decays to leptons, consistent with the requirements of an isolated lepton and a large missing transverse momentum from the neutrino, which escapes detection. The decays of W bosons to q \" q final states are reconstructed with the following procedure. For each event, we have a collection of selected jets used as input for the reconstruction of the W-boson candidates. The one or two jets that are identified as b jets are removed from the collection. W-boson candidates are constructed from all possible pairs of the remaining jets in the collection. We use both the expected mass, m fit W \u00bc 84:3 GeV, and the width, fit mW \u00bc 9:6 GeV, from a Gaussian fit to the reconstructed mass distribution of jet pairs from the decay of a W boson in simulated t \" t events. The W-boson candidate with a mass that matches the value of m fit W best is chosen as a W boson if its mass is within a AE1 fit mW window around m fit W . The jet pair that provided the hadronically decaying W boson is removed from the collection, and the procedure is repeated until no more candidates are found for W bosons decaying to jets. Different exclusive subsamples are defined according to the number of b jets (exactly one or at least two) and the number of W-boson candidates (one, two, three, and at least four). There are seven subsamples, because we do not consider the subsample with only one b jet and one W boson. The subsample with two b jets and one W boson is dominated by singly produced t 0 events. In this subsample, we apply a veto for additional jets with a transverse momentum exceeding 30 GeV. Furthermore, since b \" b background tends to have jets which are produced backto-back with balanced p T , we remove this background by requiring Table I summarizes the requirements that define the different single-lepton decay subsamples, after the criteria on the 6 E T , and the lepton and jet p T and are applied. Table II shows the observed and predicted event yields. After the selection criteria, the dominant background contributions result from the production of top-quark pairs, W \u00fe jets, and single top. Other processes with very small contributions to the total background are Z \u00fe jets and diboson production, and also top-quark pairs produced in association with a W or Z boson. The combined event yield of these processes is about 1% of the total standard-model contribution. The multijet background is found to be negligible in each of the subsamples. The reason is the requirements of an isolated muon or electron with p T > 40 GeV, a missing transverse momentum of 40 GeV, and at least one jet identified as a b jet. Data and simulation are found to agree within the combined statistic and systematic uncertainties.",

Moreover, we veto events with leptons of the same flavor which have a dilepton mass within 20 GeV of the Z-boson mass. We count the number of loose and tight leptons with a p T below 35 GeV. The threshold on the p T is required to suppress contamination from W \u00fe jets events, which would bias the estimation, because leptons produced in jets have typically a soft p T spectrum.

In general, the decay products of the fourth-generation quarks are expected to have higher transverse momenta compared to the standard-model background. This is shown in Fig. 1 for three of the subsamples. The dominant contribution to the selected signal events in the subsample with two b jets and one W boson would come from the t 0 b process. Almost no signal events are selected for A \u00bc 1, because in that case, the production cross section of t 0 b is equal to zero. The subsamples with two W bosons are dominated by t \" t events. In this case, we use two sensitive observables: S T and the mass of the hadronic bW system,  1 (color online). The S T distribution for the subsamples with two b jets and one W boson (a), one b jet and three W bosons (b), two b jets and two W bosons (c), and the m bW distribution for the subsample with two b jets and two W bosons (d). The data distributions of these observables are compared to their expectation from the simulation assuming the fitted nuisance parameters. The fitted values of the nuisance parameters represent the systematic shifts that are applied on the simulation to fit the data in the background-only hypothesis. As an illustration, the total uncertainty band is shown around the simulated expected distribution before taking into account the fitted values of the nuisance parameters. The expected distribution for a signal is shown for two different values of the V 4\u00c24 CKM parameter A and for b 0 and t 0 masses of 550 GeV. The cross section of the signal in the plots is scaled by a factor of eight for visibility. The last bin in all the histograms includes the overflow. We do not expect much signal for A \u00bc 1 in (a), because the subsample with two b jets and one W boson is mainly sensitive to single t 0 -quark production. m bW . The latter observable is sensitive to the fourthgeneration physics, because of the higher mass of a hypothetical fourth-generation t 0 quark compared to the top-quark mass. To obtain a higher sensitivity with the m bW observable, four jets need to be assigned to the quarks to reconstruct the final state t 0 \" t 0 ! WbWb ! q \" qb' ' b. Therefore, six observables with discriminating power between correct and wrong jet/quark assignments are combined with a likelihood ratio method. These observables are angles between the decay products, the W-boson mass, the transverse momentum of the top quark decaying to hadrons, and an observable related to the values of the b-jet identification variable for the jets. The jet/quark assignment with the largest value of the likelihood ratio is chosen. The mass of the bW system is then reconstructed from this chosen jet/quark assignment. The lower plots in Fig. 1 show the projections of the two-dimensional S T versus m bW distribution.",

For the uncertainty in the normalization of the background processes, we use the uncertainties in the production cross section of the various standard-model processes. The most important contributions that affect the normalization of the templates are the 12% [33] (30%) uncertainty for the top-quark pair (single-top) production cross section and a 50% uncertainty for the W production cross section because of the large fraction of selected events with jets from heavy-flavor quarks.

In particular, fourth-generation quarks with a degenerate mass below 685 GeV are excluded at the 95% CL for a parameter value of A $ 1. It is worth noting that no limits can be set for A exactly equal to unity (A \u00bc 1), because in this special case, the fourth-generation quarks would be stable in the assumed model. The analysis is, however, valid for values of A extremely close to unity. The distance between the primary vertex and the decay vertex of the fourth-generation quarks is less than 1 mm for 1 \u00c0 A > 2 \u00c2 10 \u00c014 , a number obtained using the LO formula for the decay width of the top quark in which the top-quark mass is replaced with a fourth-generation-quark mass of 600 GeV.",

            "text": "Up to now, the masses of the fourth-generation quarks were assumed to be degenerate. However, if a fourth generation of chiral quarks exists, this is not necessarily the case. Therefore, it is interesting to study how the limit would change for nondegenerate quark masses. If we assume nondegenerate masses, another decay channel for the fourth-generation quarks is possible. Namely, the branching fraction for the decay of t 0 \u00f0b 0 \u00de into b 0 \u00f0t 0 \u00de, and an off-shell W boson becomes nonzero. For values of the mass splitting up to about 25 GeV, this branching fraction is small as noted in the introduction. We assume a mass splitting of 25 GeV and unchanged branching fractions for the t 0 and b 0 decays. The sensitivity of the analysis increases or decreases depending on the specific values of the masses and hence the production cross sections of the fourth-generation quarks. The effect of the mass difference between the fourth-generation quarks on the exclusion limit is shown in the bottom plot of Fig. 2 ",

A simple model for a unitary CKM matrix has been defined based on a single parameter A \u00bc jV tb j 2 \u00bc jV t 0 b 0 j 2 . Degenerate masses have been assumed for the fourth-generation quarks, hence m t 0 \u00bc m b 0 . The information is combined from different subsamples corresponding to different final states with at least one electron or muon. Observables have been constructed in each of the subsamples and used to differentiate between the standard-model background and the processes with fourth-generation quarks. With this strategy, the search for singly and pair-produced t 0 and b 0 quarks has been combined in a coherent way into a single analysis. Model-dependent limits are derived on the mass of the quarks and the V 4\u00c24",

The existence of fourth-generation quarks with masses below 685 GeV is excluded at 95% confidence level for minimal off-diagonal mixing between the third-and the fourth-generation quarks. A nonzero cross section for the single fourthgeneration quark production processes, corresponding to a value of the V 4\u00c24 CKM parameter A < 1, gives rise to a more stringent limit. When a mass difference of 25 GeV is assumed between t 0 and b 0 quarks, the limit on m t 0 shifts by about \u00fe20\u00f0\u00c020\u00de GeV for m t 0 \u00bc m b 0 \u00fe 25 GeV (m t 0 \u00bc m b 0 \u00c0 25 GeV). These results significantly reduce the allowed parameter space for a fourth generation of fermions and raise the lower limits on the masses of the fourth generation quarks to the region where nonperturbative effects of the weak interactions are important.",

The data distributions of these observables are compared to their expectation from the simulation assuming the fitted nuisance parameters. The fitted values of the nuisance parameters represent the systematic shifts that are applied on the simulation to fit the data in the background-only hypothesis. As an illustration, the total uncertainty band is shown around the simulated expected distribution before taking into account the fitted values of the nuisance parameters. The expected distribution for a signal is shown for two different values of the V 4\u00c24 CKM parameter A and for b 0 and t 0 masses of 550 GeV. The cross section of the signal in the plots is scaled by a factor of eight for visibility. The last bin in all the histograms includes the overflow.
