The three-jet final state provides sensitivity to lower resonance masses than in previous searches using the data scouting technique. The spectrum of the dijet invariant mass, calculated from the two jets with the largest transverse momenta in the event, is used to search for a resonance. No significant excess over a smoothly falling background is found. Limits at 95% confidence level are set on the production cross section of a narrow dijet resonance and compared with the cross section of a vector dark matter mediator coupling to dark matter particles and quarks. Translating to a model where the narrow resonance interacts only with quarks, upper limits on this coupling range between 0.10 and 0.15, depending on the resonance mass. These results represent the most stringent upper limits in the mass range between 350 and 450 GeV obtained with a flavor-inclusive dijet resonance search.",

            "text": "Many models of new physics predict the existence of new massive particles coupled to quarks. The production and decay of these particles into two jets, known as dijets, have been searched for since the first high-energy hadron colliders came into operation [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9]. In some models, these particles act as mediators linking the standard model (SM) to new physics sectors containing dark matter (DM) particle candidates [10][11][12][13]. New mediators interacting with both quarks and DM particles (\u03c7 ) have been searched for using different methods: in the direct searches for DM, by measuring the recoil of an SM particle caused by the scattering with a DM particle (\u03c7 q \u2192 \u03c7 q, t-channel) [14][15][16][17][18][19][20][21][22][23][24]; with astrophysics detectors, by looking for SM particles produced through the annihilation of DM particles (\u03c7 \u03c7 \u2192 qq, s-channel) [25][26][27][28][29][30][31][32][33][34][35][36][37][38][39]; and at hadron colliders, by detecting the momentum imbalance due to the production of DM particles (qq \u2192 \u03c7\u03c7 , s-channel) [40][41][42][43][44][45][46]. The search for dijet resonances at hadron colliders (qq \u2192 qq, s-channel) can be compared with such DM searches and the results are particularly sensitive for models where the decay of the mediator into DM particles is forbidden for kinematic reasons. The search for di-E-mail address: cms -publication -committee -chair @cern .ch. jet resonances is also sensitive to the signals predicted by other models [47][48][49][50][51][52][53][54][55][56][57].",

From searches where both jets are individually resolved, the AT-LAS and CMS Collaborations have set limits for resonances with masses above 450 and 600 GeV, respectively, in mass range of 350-700 GeV, we select a three-jet final state and utilize a special high-rate trigger with low jet p T thresholds. This trigger uses a technique known as \"data scouting\" described in Section 3. This search is limited to data collected in the year 2016 in order to take advantage of the low trigger thresholds used in that data period. After 2016, these thresholds were raised in order to limit the trigger rate increase due to the larger instantaneous luminosity and pileup.",

In this process, the contribution from each calorimeter tower is assigned a momentum, the absolute value and the direction of which are found from the energy measured in the tower, and the coordinates of the geometrical center of the tower. The raw jet energy is obtained from the sum of the tower energies, and the raw jet momentum from the vectorial sum of the tower momenta. The raw jet energies are then corrected to establish a uniform relative response of the calorimeter in pseudorapidity \u03b7 and a calibrated absolute response in transverse momentum p T . The calorimetric jet energy resolution is typically 40% at a p T of 10 GeV, 12% at 100 GeV, and 5% at 1 TeV, resulting in a calorimetric dijet mass resolution of about 10% for resonance masses between 350 and 700 GeV. Events of interest are selected using a two-tiered trigger system [71]. The first level (L1), composed of custom hardware processors, uses information from the calorimeters and muon detectors to select events at a rate of around 100 kHz within a time interval of less than 4 \u03bcs. The second level, known as the high-level trigger (HLT), consists of a farm of processors running a version of the full event reconstruction software optimized for fast processing, and reduces the event rate to around 1 kHz before data storage.",

This variable is calculated using jets, reconstructed at the HLT from energy deposits in the calorimeter, and passing the selection p T > 30 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.5. Spurious jets originating from instrumental noise are rejected by requiring each jet to be detected by both ECAL and HCAL, with at least 5% of the jet energy in each of the two types of calorimeter. We form \"wide jets\", by clustering the jets already reconstructed by the HLT, using the anti-k T algorithm with a distance parameter of 1.1. This algorithm improves the dijet mass resolution and the resonance search sensitivity, by recombining jets from hard final-state radiation to obtain a reduced number of wide jets. A similar algorithm using a merging distance of R = \u221a ( \u03b7) 2 + ( \u03d5) 2 < 1.1 was employed in previous CMS searches [60,62], but it only reconstructed two wide jets per event. The wide-jet calibrations for the 2016 data scouting sample were already obtained in the low-mass dijet search of Ref. [60], and therefore we apply the same calibrations. We require at least three wide jets, each with p T > 72 GeV, in order to select events that have large H T and pass the trigger selections. This requirement is particularly effective in selecting events with low dijet invariant mass, which would be rejected if only two jets were required. Applying a common threshold to the p T of the three jets enabled us to minimize the value of the lowest resonance mass to which we are sensitive. The p T threshold of the three-jet selection has been chosen with a method that is explained in the next section. Finally, the two leading wide jets are required to have |\u03b7 1 \u2212 \u03b7 2 | < 1.1 to reduce the quantum chromodynamics multijet background, which is dominated by t-channel production of jets.",

Wrong combinations arise because either an energetic initial-state radiation jet is included in the dijet selection, or an energetic jet from final-state radiation is emitted with a distance R > 1.1 from the leading jets and therefore excluded from the reconstruction of the two leading wide jets. We investigated alternative criteria to select the dijet, such as choosing the jet pair with the largest norm of the vectorial sum p T . We found that such alternative criteria do have better performance if the resonance p T is greater than half the mass, but worse performance for this search. This is because, for accepted events, the p T of the resonance is about 150 GeV, which is less than half the resonance mass considered in this search. ",

This function is similar to that used by previous dijet searches [58-62], with a modification to the numerator. The new parameterization better fits the shape of the dijet mass spectrum for three-jet events, which includes the effect of a small inefficiency to pass the trigger for events at the lowest values of dijet mass. The function has been chosen from a pool of functions using a Fisher test [78] with a 95% confidence level (CL). The pool of functions is obtained by changing the number of degrees of freedom of the polylogarithmic function in the exponent of the denominator of Eq. (1). We perform a maximum likelihood fit of the function in Eq. (1) to our data in the mass range 290 < m jj < 1000 GeV . The chi-square per number of degrees of freedom of the fit is \u03c7 2 /NDF = 19.3/13, corresponding to a pvalue of 0.11. Fig. 1 also shows the expected dijet mass distributions of a resonance signal for three different values of resonance mass. The data distribution is well modeled by the background parameterization and there is no evidence for a dijet resonance.",

For background events, the dijet mass distribution in the signal-depleted region, so calculated, is closely similar to the dijet mass distribution in the signal region because the variables \u03b7 1 \u2212 \u03b7 2 in the signal region and \u03b7 1 + \u03b7 2 in the signal-depleted region have approximately the same uniform distribution between \u22121.1 and 1.1. The signal-depleted region contains about the same number of background events and 50% fewer signal events, and 35% of the observed events in the signal-depleted region are also in the signal region. Small datadriven corrections, which change the observed number of events by less than 5%, are applied to the dijet mass distribution in the signal-depleted region to make it the same as the background distribution in the signal region. These corrections, which are applied as a function of the product of the two largest values of jet p T in the event, are obtained by fitting an analytic function describing this product to the ratio of the numbers of events passing the signal selection to the number of events passing the signaldepleted selection. The lower edge of dijet mass included in the search, 290 GeV, has been chosen to be the lowest value of the corrected dijet mass in the signal-depleted region for which the fit of the background parameterization has a Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) probability [79][80][81] larger than 33%. The p T threshold of the three-jet selection, 72 GeV, has been chosen to obtain the lowest possible value for the corrected dijet mass in the signal-depleted region that could be included in the fit and satisfy the same KS test.

[85]. We use the profiled likelihood ratio as test statistic. The likelihood is the product of the Poisson probabilities for each of the bins in Fig. 1. The expected background yield of each bin is determined from the analytic function described in Eq. (1). The five parameters of the analytic function are profiled and their uncertainties from the fit to data are the dominant uncertainties. The shapes of the dijet mass distributions for signals are obtained from simulations. The systematic uncertainties affecting the signal shape and normalization have a minor impact and are incorporated into the likelihood function via nuisance parameters with log-normal probability distributions. We account for the uncertainty of 2% in the jet energy scale [86] by shifting the dijet mass of the signal distribution by \u00b12%. The effect of the jet energy resolution uncertainty is included by varying the width of the signal distribution by \u00b110% [86]. The signal acceptance depends significantly on the presence of a jet from initial-state or final-state radiation. We estimated the uncertainty of the simulation related to this dependence by modifying by a factor of two both the renormalization (\u03bc R ) and the factorization scales (\u03bc F ) of the initial-state and final-state radiation using the method described in Ref. [87]. This uncertainty has a negligible effect on the shape of the dijet mass distribution of the signal, and changes the normalization by 10%. The uncertainty in the integrated luminosity is 2.5% [88] and affects directly the signal normalization. The systematic uncertainty due to the choice of the background function has been estimated by measuring the signal yield in pseudo-data spectra generated using alternative background functions.

The errors are dominated by the uncertainty related to the modeling of the jet radiation used in signal simulations.

In the sub-TeV mass range, another search by the ATLAS Collaboration at 13 TeV for dijet resonances, produced in association with a photon from initialstate radiation, has set limits in the mass region between 225 and 1100 GeV [63]. A search by the CMS Collaboration at 8 TeV for resonances decaying into two bottom quarks, experimentally identified as b-tagged jets, has set limits in the mass range of 325-1200 GeV [64]. Finally, the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations have set limits in the mass range below 220 and 450 GeV, respectively, from searches for Lorentz-boosted resonances decaying into a quark-antiquark pair reconstructed as a single jet [65-67]. This paper presents a search for a dijet resonance in three-jet events that is sensitive to narrow resonances with mass between 350 and 700 GeV.
