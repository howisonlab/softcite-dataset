The method used in this study requires only the lepton energy distribution at parton level. The analysis is performed in the lepton + jets final state by using fast simulation data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of approximately 20 fb \u22121 at \u221a s = 14 TeV. Events with exactly one lepton, at least four jets and two b jets are selected. The lepton energy distribution at parton level is obtained by applying the bin-by-bin unfolding technique. The study shows that the pole mass of the top quark can be measured with an uncertainty of the order of 1 GeV.",

The top-quark mass value is one of key issues of the current researches. In particular, it plays an important role in testing the stability of the SM Higgs potential. The most precise measurement of the top-quark mass is 172.44 \u00b1 0.13 (stat.) \u00b1 0.47 (syst.) GeV from the published CMS result [1] at the LHC. The result is limited by the systematic uncertainty, coming mainly from the modeling of the hadronization. The ATLAS collaboration has also measured the top-quark mass of 172.84 \u00b1 0.34 (stat.) \u00b1 0.61 (syst.) GeV, which is mostly limited by the systematic uncertainty from the jet energy scale [2].",

To date, the pole mass has been measured with a relatively large uncertainty of around 2 GeV from the tt cross section measurements [3,4] and using tt+1 jet events [5]. In order to reduce the uncertainty, different approaches are to be explored. One of such approaches is in the direction of utilizing leptonic observables [6][7][8]. Since leptons do not involve QCD activities, leptonic observables are advantageous to the extraction of the top-quark pole mass. The latest measurement using lepton differential distributions [9] has an uncertainty as close as 1.5 GeV.",

In the LHC experiments, events with low-energy leptons are not available due to a lepton p T trigger. In Ref. [8], this problem was coped with by compensating the low energy part of the distribution with Monte-Carlo (MC) events. Since the compensating MC part has m t dependence, a way to independently extract the top-quark mass was invented. In addition, in order to avoid uncertainties related to the MC events, a way of determining the normalization of the compensating part was devised. Furthermore, an event selection was carefully chosen not to deform the parton-level distribution of the remaining part. Although these devices work well, they induce additional complexity.",

The second step is to correct detector effects such as acceptance and resolution on the lepton energy spectrum in order to obtain the energy distribution at parton level from the distribution at preselection level with the single-lepton requirement.

We multiply the unfolded energy distribution and the weight function bin by bin, and obtain the weighted sum. reconstructed top-quark masses. In this figure, the input topquark mass to the data sample is set to 173 GeV. The plot shows that the input value is correctly reconstructed for each n using the unfolded energy distribution. Figure 5 shows reconstructed top-quark masses versus input masses in a 3-GeV step for the n = 2 weight function. The  response sample with the top-quark mass of 173 GeV is used for the unfolding including the correction below the 20 GeV threshold. The statistical uncertainty is estimated by varying each bin randomly within the statistical uncertainty in the unfolded distribution. The statistical uncertainty shown on the unfolded distribution is the sum of the statistical uncertainties from the response distribution and the input distribution. This uncertainty on the unfolding is obtained by running toy MC experiments. The estimated statistical uncertainty is around 0.5% which corresponds to about 0.8 GeV for the topquark mass of 173 GeV. The statistical uncertainty described above is shown in Fig. 5. Table 1 shows the input and reconstructed top-quark masses using the weight function corresponding to n=2, 3, 5, 15. The reconstructed top-quark masses are consistent with the input top-quark masses within the sizes of the statistical error. Note that the results with different n involve different sizes of statistical and systematic uncertainties, although they are strongly correlated. In addition, there would be a systematic bias due to the 2-GeV bin width. Since a weight function with larger n has a sharper form in the low-energy region (see Fig. 3), the bias due to the bin width is larger for the larger-n weight function. To see effects of the lepton p T threshold on the result, the analysis is repeated with different lepton p T thresholds of 22, 24 and 26 GeV. Increasing the threshold would lead to a larger bias on the reconstructed top-quark mass. Table 2 shows input and reconstructed masses for various lepton p T thresholds. One can see in Table 2 that the reconstructed top-quark mass approaches the top-quark mass value of the response sample, namely 173 GeV, as the threshold increases. With the 20 GeV threshold, the bias is sufficiently small compared with the statistical uncertainty.",

The most serious bias is caused by the fact we have to rely on the response distribution from the MC sample for the lepton energy distribution below the threshold. As the lepton energy threshold goes up, we rely more and more on the response sample. In Sect. 5, we showed this possible bias is negligible when the lepton energy threshold of 20 GeV is used. The result with this threshold is consistent with the input top-quark mass within the statistical uncertainty of 0.5%. However, with a threshold of above 20 GeV, the bias becomes larger than the statistical uncertainty, and the method used in this paper has a difficulty. Therefore, it is desired that the lepton p T threshold is as low as possible. Note that this is not a critical problem for the weight function method itself. As explained in Sect. 1, this problem is solved in Ref. [8], by imposing a consistency condition that the reconstructed mass is equal to the mass for the MC sample below the threshold. The result in our study demonstrates that the simple way used in this analysis can be applied only with a p T trigger as low as 20 GeV. With a lepton p T trigger above 20 GeV, it would be essential to apply a supplementary method like the one described in Ref. [8].",

This method requires only the lepton energy distribution at parton level. Events with exclusively one lepton, at least four jets and two b jets are selected. The lepton energy distribution at reconstruction level after the selection is unfolded back to the energy distribution at parton level. In the region below the energy threshold of 20 GeV, the response sample with the top-quark mass of 173 GeV is used. The reconstructed mass of the top quark with the weight function method is consistent with the input mass within the statistical uncertainty of 0.8 GeV. We discussed and estimated some of main systematic uncertainties expected in this method. Taking into account the statistical and systematic uncertainties, the estimated uncertainty of the reconstructed top-quark mass is of the order of 1 GeV. This uncertainty is compatible with the current uncertainty of 2 GeV in the measurement of the top-quark pole mass. Therefore, the weight function method could provide an alternative approach to measure the top-quark mass without introducing large systematic uncertainties that can arise due to the jet energy measurement. This study shows that the weight function method can also provide an independent verification of the top-quark mass measurement and provide pointers toward possible improvements with Run 2 data.",
