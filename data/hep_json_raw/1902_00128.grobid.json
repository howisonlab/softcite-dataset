The exotic interactions can be mediated by hypothetical fundamental bosons which may explain several unsolved mysteries in physics. Here we expand this area of research by probing an exotic parity-odd spin-and velocitydependent interaction between the axial-vector electron coupling and the vector nucleon coupling for polarized electrons. This experiment utilizes a high-sensitivity atomic magnetometer, based on an optically polarized vapor that is a source of polarized electrons, and a solid-state mass containing unpolarized nucleons. The atomic magnetometer can detect an effective magnetic field induced by the exotic interaction between unpolarized nucleons and polarized electrons. We set an experimental limit on the electron-nucleon coupling g e A g N V < 10 \u00c030 at the mediator boson mass below 10 \u22124 eV, significantly improving the current limit by up to 17 orders of magnitude.",

To date, 15 possible interactions have been derived by considering the spins and the relative velocity of two interacting fermions 1,3 . In recent theoretical literature, mediators of such interactions have been generically defined as WISPs (weakly interacting sub-eV particles) 4 including the most plausible mediators, the axion and the hidden photon. The axion is a hypothetical spin-0 pseudoscalar boson that can explain the puzzling strong charge-parity (CP) problem in the quantum chromodynamics (QCD) [5][6][7] and is a theoretically well-motivated candidate for dark matter in the Universe 8,9 . The hidden photon [10][11][12] is a hypothetical spin-1 boson arising from the breaking of a U(1) gauge symmetry, which can be a dark matter candidate as well, indirectly interacting with ordinary particles 13,14 . Detection of WISPs is challenging because they are only very weakly coupled to fermions to mediate interactions between the fermions. Recent WISPs searches, such as the Axion Dark Matter eXperiment (ADMX) 15 , are reviewed in ref. 16 .",

Recently, we have expanded this area of research using a highly sensitive non-cryogenic atomic magnetometer based on an optically pumped alkali-metal atomic vapor 20,21 . The atomic magnetometer operates in the spin-exchange relaxation-free (SERF) regime in which the effects of spinexchange collisions on spin relaxation are tuned off, dramatically improving the sensitivity to the femto-Tesla level 22,23 . Our approach probes exotic interactions between optically polarized electrons in an atomic vapor and unpolarized or polarized particles of a solid-state mass in the vicinity of the atomic vapor.",

The circularly polarized pump laser beam serves to pump atomic spins into the stretched state, creating nearly 100% polarization. The linearly polarized probe laser beam serves to detect the spin projection along the probe beam. The non-zero spin projection results in the rotation of light polarization, due to the strong birefringence of the spin-polarized vapor, and is measured with a polarizing beam splitter and two photo detectors as a small difference in the balanced output. The interaction of an external magnetic field with the polarized atomic spins leads to a change in the orientations of the spins and hence in the observed light polarization rotation. Because Eq.

This was done by randomly generating 2 20 electron-nucleon pairs inside the volumes, summing the potential P eff between each pair based on Eq.

The velocity magnitude, v, was 15.38 mm s \u22121 , used in the present experiments. As shown in Fig. 2, the interaction potential gets weaker as the mass moves away from the vapor and drops more drastically for the smaller interaction range due to the term of e \u2212r/\u03bb in Eq.

The initial configuration was chosen because the sample holder contacted the head of the magnetometer when Shift < \u22121 mm. The motor was able to repeat this mass motion continuously, during which we recorded the magnetometer signals for 77 h using a 24-bit analog-to-digital converter (PXIe-4497 provided by National Instruments) with a sampling rate of 1 kHz. Figure 3b shows standard time traces of the magnetometer signal, which present two full cycles of the mass motion reversal. Here one cycle refers to one extension with v = 15.38 mm s \u22121 and one retraction with v = \u221215.38 mm s \u22121 of the mass. The motor provided a voltage output which allows us to distinguish the mass motion's direction, as shown in Fig. 3c. This was also recorded simultaneously with the magnetometer signal. The rising and falling edges served as the reference points for each half cycle. The motor had a delay time of 0.05 s after each extension and retraction of the mass, necessary to reverse the mass motion's direction, thus the time elapsed for one cycle was 0.75 s. As discussed above, to extract the magnitude of the effective magnetic field, B eff , from the magnetometer signals, we selected the middle configuration of each motion which corresponds to Shift = 1.5 mm, as shown in Fig. 3a, equivalent to the data point at the first 50% of the data in each half cycle, as shown in Fig. 3b. However, instead of taking only one data point in each half cycle for the extraction of B eff , we used the mean of three data points, i.e., the data point at the first 50% of the data \u00b1 the adjacent data points. The distance between data points is 15 \u03bcm.",

The SERF atomic magnetometer used in this work operates in a single-beam configuration in which a single circularly polarized laser beam is used to pump and probe the Rb electron spins 39 . The single-beam configuration is suboptimal in terms of magnetic field sensitivity. For an improved design, the magnetometer would use an orthogonal-beam configuration in which the probe beam is perpendicular to the pump beam, and the laser beams' wavelengths are individually optimized. This modification can improve the sensitivity to 1 fT Hz \u22121/2 immediately. Further work will bring the magnetometer close to the fundamental photon shot noise limit of subfemto-Tesla to atto-Tesla 41 by reducing the noise sources from laser frequency and intensity fluctuations and by using the hybrid optical pumping 41 .

A SERF atomic magnetometer employed for the experiments, manufactured by QuSpin Inc., is a compact, self-contained unit with all the necessary optical components and can be readily operated using a control software. Practically, the SERF regime is achieved by operating in a near-zero magnetic field and by heating the Rb vapor; a SERF magnetometer is sensitive at low frequency below 100 Hz. It is mainly composed of a 3 mm cube 87 Rb vapor cell, a single semiconductor 795 nm laser for both optical pumping and probing, and silicon photodiodes 39 . The dimensions of the magnetometer module are: length 8 cm, width 1.4 cm, and height 2.1 cm. The cell temperature is around 160\u00b0C for sufficiently large Rb density. The action of the laser beam creates a large number of polarized Rb electron spins in the vapor cell and its intensity transmitted through the cell is detected using the photodiode. The output from the photodoide is an analogue voltage signal and it can be converted to a magnetic field signal by applying a known calibration field to the vapor cell. In order to reduce the effects of the laser noise due to intensity fluctuation, the magnetometer uses a modulating field at 926 Hz 39 . The measured field at a certain low frequency is restored using a built-in lock-in amplifier and a low-pass filter.",

The motor was positioned away from the magnetic shields and was enclosed by a singlelayer open \u03bc-metal box to suppress magnetic noise arising from the motor operation [seeFig. 1b]. The translation stage precisely adjusted the position of the mass in the vicinity of the Rb vapor. In order to prevent the mass from oscillating due to the movement of the long G10 rod, a non-magnetic air bushing (OAV0500IB) was closely mounted to the ferrite shield, providing an additional support of the G10 rod with nearly frictionless motion of the mass. To reduce systematic effects due to vibrations induced by the motor moving the mass, the frame holding both the atomic magnetometer and the magnetic shields was decoupled from the frame holding the moving mass, as indicated inFig. 1a, b.As illustrated inFig. 1c, the relative velocity term in the interaction V was created by linearly moving the BGO mass along the z-axis with a constant velocity v next to the Rb vapor located in the magnetometer head. The standoff distance between the nearest surfaces of the mass and the vapor was set to 5 mm, limited by the location of the vapor. The Rb electron spins were oriented along the x-axis and the magnetometer was sensitive to the z component of a magnetic field with the intrinsic field noise level of 15 fT Hz \u22121/2 , at low frequency.

In a-c, 1 is a motor enclosed by a single-layer open \u03bc-metal box, 2 is a three-axis translation stage, 3 is a fiberglass G10 rod, 4 is a frictionless air bushing, 5 is a three-layer open \u03bc-metal co-axial cylindrical shield, 6 is a cylindrical ferrite shield, 7 is a sample holder, 8 is a unpolarized BGO mass, 9 is a SERF atomic magnetometer, and 10 is a plastic holder for the atomic magnetometer; 11 and 12 are aluminum frames holding the motor system moving the mass and the magnetometer/shields system, respectively. The frames are decoupled so as to reduce mechanical vibrations due to the mass motion. An unpolarized BGO mass is placed next to the rubidium atomic vapor cell located inside the head of the atomic magnetometer module. The BGO mass is translated up and down in z-direction with a constant velocity v",
