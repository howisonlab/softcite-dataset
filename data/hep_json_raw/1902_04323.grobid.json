The Parton Distribution Function (PDF) uncertainties are a potential limitation for measurements of M W with LHC data. It has recently been pointed out that, thanks to LHCb's unique forward rapidity acceptance, a new measurement of M W by LHCb can improve this situation. Here we report on a detailed study on the mechanism driving the PDF uncertainty in the LHCb measurement of M W , and propose an approach which should reduce this uncertainty by roughly a factor of two using LHCb Run 2 data.",

Of notable interest is the mass of the W boson (M W ) because, currently, it is predicted with higher precision than it is measured. The 2018 update of the electroweak fit by the gFitter collaboration indirectly predicts M W = 80354 \u00b1 7 MeV/c 2 [1]. This prediction is more precise than the average of direct measurements reported by the Particle Data Group, M W = 80379 \u00b1 12 MeV/c 2 [2], which is dominated by measurements using W \u2192 \u03bd decays at hadron collider experiments, where can be either an electron or a muon.",

The combination of measurements by the CDF [3] and D0 [4] experiments at the Fermilab Tevatron pp collider is M W = 80387 \u00b1 16 MeV/c 2 [4]. In pp collisions W bosons are primarily produced by the annihilation of valence quarks and antiquarks. By contrast, gluons and sea quarks play a critical role in the pp collisions at the LHC. Measurements of M W at the LHC are therefore expected to be more susceptible to theoretical uncertainties in the modeling of W production, in particular those related to the Parton Distribution Functions (PDFs), than at the Tevatron [5][6][7][8][9]. The ATLAS Collaboration reported a measurement of M W = 80370 \u00b1 13 \u00b1 14 MeV/c 2 where the first and second uncertainties are experimental and theoretical, respectively [10]. The dominant contribution to the theoretical uncertainty can be attributed to the PDFs. A key challenge of future measurements by ATLAS and CMS will be to reduce the PDF uncertainty.",

LHCb [11] is a single-arm spectrometer with full charged particle tracking and identification capabilities over the range 2 < \u03b7 < 5, which is mostly orthogonal to the acceptance of ATLAS and CMS. While LHCb is primarily designed for the study of beauty and charm hadrons, it has a strong track record in measurements of W and Z production in muonic final states [12,13]. As for precision electroweak tests, LHCb has already measured the effective weak mixing angle sin 2 \u03b8 lept eff [14], but the potential for a measurement of M W was not realised until recently.   \u221a s values in Run 1. Using the methods described in this paper we estimate that the Run 2 data could yield a M W measurement with a statistical uncertainty of roughly 10 MeV/c 2 . The obvious next question is how well the theoretical uncertainties, in particular those related to the PDFs, can be controlled. Reference [15] estimated that the PDF uncertainties in a standalone LHCb measurement would be larger than those in ATLAS and CMS. However, the uncertainty on the LHCb measurement would be partially anticorrelated with those of ATLAS and CMS. It is therefore claimed that the introduction of a LHCb measurement into a LHC M W average could reduce the overall PDF uncertainty. Similar improvements may be possible with the extended angular coverage of the upgraded ATLAS and CMS detectors in the HL-LHC era, as explored in a recent study by ATLAS [16]. Given the large size of the LHCb Run 2 dataset, and anticipated future data with LHCb Upgrade I [17] and the proposed Upgrade II [18], it seems worthwhile to study in greater detail the cause of the PDF uncertainty in a measurement of M W by LHCb, and possible strategies to reduce it.",

Toy data histograms are generated by randomly fluctuating the bins around the nominal distribution, assuming these yields and Poisson statistics. These histograms can be generated with different PDF sets using the reweighting procedure already described. The current study neglects experimental systematic uncertainties, such as those due to the knowledge of the momentum scale and the dependence of the muon identification efficiency on p \u03bc T and \u03b7, and does not address the treatment of higher order QCD corrections in the p W T modelling [25,26]. The data histograms are compared to templates with different PDF and M W hypotheses. The normalisation of each template is scaled to match the data such that the fit only considers the shape information. For a given PDF hypothesis a single-parameter (1D) fit determines the value of M W that minimises the \u03c7 2 between a toy and the templates. The 68% C.L. statistical uncertainty corresponds to a variation of \u0394\u03c7 2 = 1 with respect to the parabola minimum.  (20) MeV/c 2 for the W + (W \u2212 ). The broadly parabolic distributions of the best-fit \u03c7 2 (\u03c7 2 min ) versus M W indicate that the PDF replicas that most severely bias M W tend to give a measurably poorer fit quality. Before evaluating how this information could be used to constrain the PDF uncertainty let us first try to understand in more detail the underlying mechanism behind the PDF uncertainty. Figure 3 shows how the different partonic subprocesses contribute to the cross-section for W production as a function of rapidity (y). The dominant W + (W \u2212 ) production subprocesses involve valence u(d) quarks. Annihilation of gluons with sea quarks (gq s ) contributes for around a 20% factor. Contributions from only second generation quarks annihilation are below 10% or so.    ",

There is a clear anticorrelation between the changes in the shapes of the y and p W T distributions which is expected from the kinematics and is enhanced by the forward acceptance cuts applied to the lepton, but further patterns can be seen in the colour distribution. In the W + case, the replicas that bias M W upwards (downwards) tend to predict larger (smaller) y values and smaller (larger) p W T values. The opposite pattern is seen for the W \u2212 case.

Reference [28] showed that correlated changes in the shapes of the \u03b7 and p \u03bc T distributions in the phase-space acceptance of ATLAS and CMS can be used to further constrain the PDFs. It is therefore interesting to consider a similar approach in the LHCb phase-space acceptance. Figure 7 shows how the muon p \u03bc T and \u03b7 distributions vary with the PDF replicas. As expected the replicas that bias M W upwards (downwards) correspond to a decrease (increase) in the predicted cross-section at high p \u03bc T with respect to low p \u03bc T . An intriguing observation, however, is that the replicas that provide the largest bias on M W change not only the shape of the p \u03bc T distribution but also that of the \u03b7 distribution. This is a measurable change of up to several percent, which could be exploited to constrain the PDF uncertainty. Figure 8 shows the mean p \u03bc T versus the mean \u03b7 for each replica, with the M W dependent colour scale as before. The replicas that bias M W tend to be clearly separated in this two-dimensional plane, which encourages us to consider exploiting this information to constrain the PDF uncertainty.",

The high constraining power of the proposed method is manifest in the large reduction of the effective number of replicas. The weights are clearly dependent on the toy data, so it is now important to consider the results with multiple toy datasets. For a single toy dataset the PDF uncertainty is defined by the RMS of the M W values for the 1000 replicas. Figure 10 shows the distribution of the PDF uncertainty for 1000 toy datasets, comparing the one-dimensional fit with and without weights, and the two-dimensional fit with weights. In the one-dimensional case the weighting reduces the uncertainty by an average factor of 10 (20)% for the W + (W \u2212 ), with a larger spread of the distributions under data fluctuations. In the one-dimensional weighted case this is estimated to be about 0.8 (1.2) MeV/c 2 for the W + (W \u2212 ), in contrast to the 0.04 (0.07) MeV/c 2 of the unweighted case. The two-dimensional weighted case corresponds to a most probable improvement by a factor of roughly two (1.5) for the W + (W \u2212 ), with a spread under data fluctuations of 0.9 (1.2) MeV/c 2 . Since the outcome of the PDF replica weighting depends on the data, the computation of the PDF uncertainty becomes much more sensitive to the statistical fluctuations of the data themselves. This explains the broadening of the PDF uncertainty distributions once the weighting is applied. This effect becomes even larger for the two-dimensional fit because of its higher constraining power. However, even considering the broadening effect, there is a clear separation between the twodimensional weighted PDF uncertainty distribution and that of the one-dimensional unweighted (reference) fit approach. These encouraging results strongly motivate the adoption of the two-dimensional fit method by LHCb.   Fig. 11 The distribution of the W \u2212 versus W + mass determined from a single toy dataset with each of the NNPDF3.1 replicas. Ten percent of the replicas with the highest P(\u03c7 2 ) (product over the two W charges) are assigned red markers 5.1 Simultaneous fit of W + and W \u2212 samples Following the promising results shown for separate fits to the W + and W \u2212 data it is now interesting to consider the combination of the two charges. Figure 11 shows, separately for the one-dimensional and two-dimensional approaches, the W + versus W \u2212 fit results for a single toy dataset. Each point represents a different PDF replica. Interestingly, for both fit approaches, there is a clear negative correlation, which implies a partial cancellation of the PDF uncertainty when the W + and W \u2212 data are combined. It is now interesting to see how this partial anti-correlation is affected by (i) the weights and (ii) moving to a two-dimensional fit. Therefore, in Fig. 11 ten percent of the points corresponding to the largest product (over the two W charges) of P(\u03c7 2 min ) values are highlighted. Unfortunately, in both the one-and two-dimensional fit cases, the subset of favoured replicas exhibits a correlation coefficient with a reduced magnitude. Figure 12 shows the \u03c7 2 min versus M W values for combined (W + and W \u2212 ) fits to a single toy dataset. The normalisation for both the datasets is scaled by the same parameter to take into account the integrated charge asymmetry constraint on the PDFs. Each point corresponds to a different NNPDF3.1 replica, and the results are shown separately for the one-dimensional and two-dimensional fits. The weighted and unweighted M W distributions are shown with corresponding Gaussian fits overlaid. With these data the weights have very little effect on the width of the distribution in the one-dimensional case. The effective number of replicas (N eff ) after reweighting, computed using Eq. 3, is indeed 928. In the two-dimensional case, however, there is roughly a factor of two of improvement. The effective number of replicas estimated for this case (N eff =  Fig. 12 Upper: the distribution of \u03c7 2 versus M W for a one-dimensional (left) and two-dimensional (right) simultaneous fit to a single toy dataset, which assumes the LHCb Run 2 statistics, with each of the 1000 NNPDF3.1 replicas. Lower: the extracted M W values, with a Gaussian fit function overlaid, without (black) and with (red) weighting. In the simultaneous fit the W + and W \u2212 templates share the same normalisation 35) is showing a very large constraining power of the data and suggests that, for the final measurement, a more robust approach like the Hessian method or an increase of the number of replicas in the reweigting procedure, is necessary to guarantee the statistical reliability of the results obtained with the two-dimensional fit. Figure 13 (left) shows the distribution of the PDF uncertainty in 1000 toy datasets, in combined fits of the W + and W \u2212 data. Compared to the traditional one-dimensional fit, the addition of the weighting typically improves the PDF uncertainty by around 10%. The two-dimensional fit with weighting is, however, typically around a factor of two better. If the normalisation is no longer shared between the W + and W \u2212 the uncertainty is typically slightly larger, but this change is usually less than 1 MeV/c 2 . Figure 13 (right) considers an alternative approach whereby the W + and W \u2212 data are analysed separately, and the corresponding M W values are combined in a weighted average. This results in larger uncertainties, and therefore encourages the simultaneous fit of W + and W \u2212 data with a single shared M W fit parameter.",

It is interesting to now consider how the results depend on this choice, since the LHCb acceptance extends slightly outside this eta range, and LHCb is able to trigger on muons with far smaller p \u03bc T values without any prescales. Figure 14 shows how the PDF uncertainties depend on the width of the p \u03bc T interval, which is symmetric around M W /2. Each band is centered on the mean of the distribution of the PDF uncertainty evaluated for 1000 toy datasets and its width is defined as the RMS of the same distribution. With the simple one-dimensional unweighted fit the PDF uncertainty grows approximately linearly with the width of the p \u03bc T interval. This is also the case for the oneand two-dimensional weighted fits, though the slope is less severe. Despite this study suggests that choosing a smaller fit range yields to smaller PDF uncertainties, the reduction of this range has an impact on the statistical precision of the measurement as well. Figure 15 considers separately the dependence on the minimum and maximum \u03b7 value. The T range (the full width, centered around M W /2) used in the simultaneous fit. The bands report the mean and the RMS of the distribution of the PDF uncertainty evaluated for 1000 toy datasets. The \u03b7 range is set to 2 < \u03b7 < 4.5. In the two dimensional fits three \u03b7 bins are used uncertainty is found to reduce when the \u03b7 range is extended in either direction. The uncertainty is not significantly changed if the number of \u03b7 bins is increased from the nominal value of three. Using only three bins in \u03b7 should make the experimental control of the \u03b7 dependence of the muon efficiency more straightforward to control than if more bins are required.",

            "text": "It has recently been suggested that LHCb should perform a measurement of M W based on a one-dimensional fit to the muon p \u03bc T distribution in samples of W \u2192 \u03bc\u03bd decays. Thanks to LHCb's unique angular coverage this measurement would complement those performed by ATLAS and CMS, particularly when considering PDF uncertainties. Here we report on a detailed study of the PDF uncertainty, restricting to the NNPDF3.1 set, on the proposed LHCb measurement. It is found that the variations in the PDFs that tend to bias the determination of M W lead to clear patterns of variation in the shapes of the W kinematic distributions, in particular the rapidity distribution. A particularly interesting observation is that those variations also lead to a measurable change in the shape of the muon \u03b7 distribution. An analysis performed on a two-dimensional ( p \u03bc T versus \u03b7) plane would reduce the capability of the PDFs to give rise to changes in the p \u03bc T distribution that can be misidentified as variations of M W . Therefore, with large enough data samples, a two-dimensional fit to the p \u03bc T versus \u03b7 distribution, with PDF replica weighting, would allow the PDF uncertainty to be further constrained. A study with 1000 experiments, assuming the LHCb Run 2 statistics, indicates a typical improvement of around a factor of two, compared to the one-dimensional fit to the p \u03bc T spectrum alone, when fitting the W + and W \u2212 data simultaneously. Alternative approaches to the PDF replica reweighting, such as the Hessian method, should be considered in future studies towards the real measurement. The full PDF uncertainty should also include the variation between results from different PDF fitting groups, but this is a very encouraging result. In order to facilitate the study of the possible impact of other data a table of M W biases for the first 100 NNPDF3.1 replicas is provided as supplementary material. The main study considers events in which the muon satisfies 2 < \u03b7 < 4.5 and 30 < p  (2). In the two dimensional fits three \u03b7 bins are used also studied since there are likely to be many considerations on the optimal fit range for the real measurement.",

Large W samples are therefore required to resolve this subtle change in the shape of the p \u03bc T distribution.
