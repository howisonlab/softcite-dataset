Independent analyses of ttH final states containing at least six hadronic jets are performed, based on detailed simulations of SiD and ILD, the two candidate detector concepts for the ILC. We estimate that a statistical precision on y t of 4.5 % can be obtained with an integrated luminosity of 1 ab \u22121 that is split equally between two configurations for the beam polarization P(e \u2212 , e + ), (\u221280 %, +20 %) and (+80 %, \u221220 %). This estimate improves to 4 % if the 1 ab \u22121 sample is assumed to be fully in the P(e \u2212 , e + ) = (\u221280 %, +20 %) configuration.",

In the SM, the coupling strength of the Higgs boson to a fermion is given by y f = \u221a 2m f /v, where m f is the fermion mass and v \u2248 246 GeV is the vacuum expectation value. Since the top quark is the heaviest known elementary particle, the measurement of the top Yukawa coupling, y t , serves as the high endpoint to test this prediction. A sizable deviation in y t from the SM prediction is expected in various new physics scenarios, which motivates a precise measurement of y t . For example, in composite Higgs models, where the Higgs boson is a pseudo-Nambua e-mail: t.price@bham.ac.uk b e-mail: philipp.roloff@cern.ch c e-mail: jan.strube@pnnl.gov d e-mail: tomohiko@icepp.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp Goldstone boson, y t could deviate up to tens of %, even in the scenario that no new particles are discovered in LHC Run 2 data [3].",

The size of this effect is studied by evaluating the behavior of the e + e \u2212 \u2192 ttH cross section when changing y t from the SM value, using the linear approximation \u0394y t /y t = \u03ba \u2022 \u0394\u03c3 /\u03c3 . In the absence of the Higgs-strahlung diagram, we would find \u03ba = 0.5. Instead, we find \u03ba = 0.52, indicating a nonnegligible contribution from the Higgs-strahlung diagram to the total cross section at \u221a s = 1 TeV. This factor is used in the extraction of the top Yukawa coupling precision. The correction will be known with good precision, because the Higgs coupling to the Z boson can be extracted from measurements of e + e \u2212 \u2192 ZH events at \u221a s = 250 GeV with a statistical uncertainty of about 1.5 % [12].",

In a the Higgs boson is radiated from a top quark and b is the background Higgs-strahlung process where the Higgs boson is radiated from the Z boson which are b jets, an isolated lepton, and missing energy and momentum from a neutrino. For isolated leptons, only the prompt electrons and muons are reconstructed and considered as signal, neglecting the decays into \u03c4 leptons. These two modes are reconstructed in independent samples and are combined statistically. Irreducible backgrounds to these processes arise from the eight-fermion final states of ttZ where the Z decays into a bb pair and ttbb where the tt system radiates a hard gluon which forms a bb pair. A large background contribution also arises from tt due to the huge relative cross section compared to the signal. There is also a contribution from the other decay modes of the ttH system such as the Higgs decaying to final states other than a bb pair and the fully leptonic decays of the top quarks.",

During the collision, a number of processes occur in addition to the primary scattering event. The production of incoherent electron-positron pairs results in an average of 4.5 \u00d7 10 5 low-momentum particles per bunch crossing. We assume an average of 4.1 hadronic events from two-photon processes (\u03b3 \u03b3 \u2192 hadrons) with a diphoton-invariant mass greater than 300 MeV. The distributions of the particles originating from these processes in the (polar angle, energy) plane are shown in Fig. 2. They do not affect the reconstruction significantly, but present a challenge to the sub-detector occupancies and pattern recognition. The SiD analysis includes both effects, while the ILD analysis includes only the \u03b3 \u03b3 \u2192 hadrons processes. The SiD analysis shows that incoherent pairs are under control by incorporating a detector design capable of time stamping individual bunch crossings. The baseline technology of the ILD barrel vertex detector integrates over 18 bunch crossings in layer 2 up to 180 bunch crossings in layers 3-6. Preliminary results of studies that take advantage of recent progress in the track reconstruction show a relative reduction of the b-tag purity at 80 % efficiency by about 7 %, while the c-tag purity at 60 % efficiency suffers a relative loss of 13 % [26]. Reducing the impact using advanced pattern recognition techniques in a detector design with smaller pixels that integrate over a whole bunch train is the subject of ongoing efforts.",

The efficiency is defined as the fraction of leptons with correctly identified flavor. The purity is defined as the ratio of the number of leptonic W decays of a given flavor to the number of reconstructed isolated leptons of that flavor. Leptons from heavy flavor meson decays and charged pions mis-identified as leptons are considered as background. An efficiency of 82 % (89 %) and purity of 95 % (97 %) for electrons (muons) is observed in ILD and 86 % (86 %) efficiency and 94 % (95 %) purity for electrons (muons) in SiD. The particles from beam-induced backgrounds as described in Sect. 5 tend towards low transverse momenta and small angles with respect to the beam axis. Different approaches are used to suppress the impact of the beam-induced backgrounds. For the SiD analysis, only the reconstructed objects in the range 20 \u2022 < \u03b8 < 160 \u2022 are considered, because the ttH final state is produced via s-channel exchange and is not suppressed by this selection. In the ILD analysis, the longitudinally-invariant k T jet algorithm [27,28] with a value of 1.2 for the R parameter is employed to suppress the particles close to the beam axis. Only the particles grouped into the physics jets by the k T algorithm are considered further in the analysis. Figure 3 shows how the impact of the beaminduced backgrounds on the reconstructed Higgs mass is mitigated by the removal procedure. A modified version of the Durham jet finding algorithm [29] then groups all particles in the event into a specified number of jets, without splitting decay products of secondary vertices across different jets.",

In either case, the isolated leptons described in Sect. 6.1 are removed before the jet finding steps. Heavy flavor identification is primarily used to remove the tt background. Both the six-jet and eight-jet final states contain four b jets. The tt events contain no more than two b jets from the top decays as do \u223c80 % of ttZ. The flavor tagging classifier for the measurement of ttH production was trained on events with six quarks of the same flavor produced in electron-positron annihilation. For the training, 60000 cand b jets, and 180000 light flavor quark jets are used. These samples were chosen since the jets have similar kinematic properties as those in ttH signal events. For a b-jet identification efficiency of 50 %, the misidentification fraction is found to be about 0.12 % for c-jets and about 0.05 % for light quark (uds) jets for both detectors, evaluated using twojet final states at \u221a s = 91 GeV [11]. The misidentification fraction for c-jets (uds-jets) increases by 100 % (60 %) when incoherent electron-positron pairs and \u03b3 \u03b3 \u2192 hadrons processes are included in the simulation as described in Sect. 5. For the six-quark final states at \u221a s = 1 TeV, the misidentification fractions typically degrade by a factor of two in addition due to the varying jet energies and the confusion in the jet clustering due to the increased number of jets. Figure 4a shows the distribution of the response from the flavor-tagging multivariate selection for the jet that has the third-highest tagging probability. In both analyses, the shape of the distribution of the flavor tagging response, rather than a simple cut, is used. The background channels, in particular tt, are dominated by the peak at low values. The peak at higher values in the ttZ channel is due to events with four genuine b jets.",

For the tt process, the electroweak corrections are known to the 1-loop level [34], while the QCD corrections are known at the 3-loop level [35][36][37][38][39]. QCD contributions to the ttbb cross section make this value more challenging to compute precisely; in principle the measurement of the gluon splitting rate at relevant energies will provide a handle to estimate its size.
