Using this data sample, the processes e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b7J/\u03c8 and \u03c0 0 J/\u03c8 cross section are measured. 1 In this analysis, the J/\u03c8 is reconstructed through its decays into lepton pairs while \u03b7/\u03c0 0 is reconstructed in the \u03b3\u03b3 final state. After imposing all of some selection criteria, a clear J/\u03c8 signal is observed in the \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 mode while indications of a peak around 3.1 GeV/c 2 also exist in the e + e \u2212 mode. A significant \u03b7 signal is observed in M (\u03b3\u03b3) in both J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 and J/\u03c8 \u2192 e + e \u2212 , as shown in Fig. 1. No significant \u03c0 0 signal is observed. The M (\u03b3\u03b3) invariant mass distributions are fitted using an unbinned maximum likelihood method. For the \u03b7 signal, the statistical significance is larger than 10\u03c3 while that for the \u03c0 0 signal is only 1.1\u03c3. The Born cross section for e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b7J/\u03c8 is measured to be  Distributions of M (\u03b3\u03b3) between 0.2 GeV/c 2 and 0.9 GeV/c 2 for J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 (left panel) and for J/\u03c8 \u2192 e + e \u2212 (middle panel) and distribution of M (\u03b3\u03b3) below 0.3 GeV/c 2 for J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 (right panel).

Figure 3 shows the \u03b7 c invariant mass distributions for selected \u03b7 c candidates, together with the estimated backgrounds. A clear \u03b7 c signal is evident in every decay mode. Assuming 100% interference between the \u03b7 c and the non-resonant amplitude, an unbinned simultaneous maximum likelihood fit was performed. In the fit, the \u03b7 c mass, width, and relative phases are free parameters, and the mass and width are constrained to be the same for all decay modes. Two solutions of relative phase are found for every decay mode, one represents constructive interference, the other for destructive. The measured mass is M = 2984.3 \u00b1 0.6(stat.) \u00b1 0.6(syst.) MeV/c 2 and width \u0393 = 32.0 \u00b1 1.2(stat.) \u00b1 1.0(syst.) MeV. The interference is significant, which indicates previous measurements of the \u03b7 c mass and width via radiative transitions may need to be rechecked. The results are consistent with that from photon-photon fusion and B decays; this may partly clarify the discrepancy puzzle.",
