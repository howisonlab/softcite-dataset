The nuclear modification factor and cross section ratio with different collision energies are measured. Both results imply cold nuclear matter effects on heavy-flavour production in p-Pb collisions are small enough to be negligible and there is no significant collision energy dependence between \u221a s NN = 8.16 TeV and \u221a s NN = 5.02 TeV.",

            "text": "Due to the larger masses (m c,b \u226b \u039b QCD ), heavy quarks (charm and beauty) are produced in hard scatterings processes at early stage of the collisions. Therefore, charm and beauty are powerful probes to test perturbative QCD calculations in pp collisions and study the properties of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) produced in Pb-Pb collisions. Strong suppression of the production of electrons from charm and beauty hadron decays at high p T has been observed in Pb-Pb collisions with ALICE at the LHC [1]. For further understanding of the properties of the QGP such as energy loss mechanism in the dense matter, it is very important to study Cold Nuclear Matter (CNM) effects in order to distinguish the role of initial-and final-state effects on heavy-flavour production. CNM effects on heavy quark production can be studied in proton-nucleus collisions. In this contribution, we present measurement of the production of electrons from charm and beauty hadron decays in p-Pb collisions at \u221a s NN = 8.16 TeV. We report the p T dependence of the nuclear modification factor (R pPb ) and ratio of cross section of heavy-flavour decays electrons in p-Pb collisions with different collision energies, \u221a s NN = 8.16 TeV and \u221a s NN = 5.02 TeV.",

Particles produced in collisions are reconstructed with excellent particle identification capabilities. Heavy-flavour hadrons are measured by direct reconstruction of D mesons and charm baryons, or indirectly tagged via single electrons or muons from semi-leptonic decay channels of heavy quarks. This analysis has been performed using experimental data from p-Pb collisions at \u221a s NN = 8.16 TeV collected in 2016 by the ALICE detector. Minimum bias data is triggered by coincidence of two V0 detectors. The V0 detector consists of two scintillator arrays placed in 2.8 < \u03b7 < 5.1 and \u22123.7 < \u03b7 < \u22121.7, covering full azimuth. For extending p T reach of electrons, events triggered by the Electro-Magnetic Calorimeter (EMCal) are also analyzed. The EMCal trigger requires clusters on the EMCal over threshold energies (5.5 GeV and 8 GeV). Tracks of charged particles produced in collisions are reconstructed by the Inner Tracking System (ITS) and the Time Projection Chamber (TPC).",

In this analysis, electron identification is performed by using the TPC and the EMCal. Electrons identification with the EMCal is based on the feature of electron; the energy deposit of electrons in the EMCal (E) is equal to momentum measured in the TPC (p) due to small mass of electrons (p \u226b m e ). Particles in the TPC are characterized using the ionization energy loss (dE/dx). A cut on the shower shape properties in EMCal is also applied to reduce the contamination of hadronic showers. E/p ratio of electron candidates is shown in Fig. 1. and clear peak is observed around E/p \u223c 1. Hadron contamination is estimated with data-driven approach and statistically subtracted from electron candidates. E/p of hadron is measured by selecting hadron tracks based on dE/dx and scaled to match the E/p between 0.4 and 0.5 where hadrons are dominant in the distribution.  The nuclear modification factor R pPb is defined as the equation below:",
