            "text": "The Beijing Spectrometer (BES) is a large general purpose solenoidal detector 1 at the Beijing Electron Positron Collider (BEPC), which was designed for the \u03c4 -charm physics in the center-of-mass energy range of 2\u22125 GeV. The principal sub-detectors of BES are the central drift charmber (CDC), the main drift chamber (MDC), the barrel and endcap shower counters (BSC, ESC), magnet with a 0.4 T magnetic field, moun counters(MUC) and luminosity monitor (LUMI). Since its completion in 1989, the BES detector had been in operation successfully. About 9 million J/\u03c8 events, 4 million \u03c8(2S) events and 22.3 nb \u22121 data at 4.03 GeV were collected for studying charmonium and charm decays. Of particular importance was a scan of the beam energy across the \u03c4 pair production threshold, which was performed to precisely measure the \u03c4 mass. After running for 6 years, aging effects were seen. Thus a major upgrade on the BES detector (called BESII afterwards), 2 as displayed in Fig. 1, was made from 1996 to improve its performance. Meanwhile, the improvements on BEPC to increase the luminosity were performed, which are described in Ref. 3. In addition, a GEANT3 based Monte Carlo (MC) package (SIMBES) 4 with detailed consideration of the BESII detector performance was used to improve the consistency between data and MC.",

However, in this paper we only focus on the two precision measurements, \u03c4 mass at BES and R value at BESII, which are both very important in the test of the Standard Model (SM). The former one provides a significant test of lepton universality, while the latter one is used to determine the vacuum polarization, which plays a crucial role in the precision determination of the QED running coupling constant evaluated at the Z mass, \u03b1(M 2 Z ), and the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, a \u00b5 . The purpose of this review is to look back at these two precision measurements, pointing out the research in the energy region in 2 \u2212 5 GeV has been extraordinarily productive and the exploration of this interesting and important physics has not even been exhausted in the past. Results relevant to this energy range have been, and continue to be accumulated by the BESIII 7 experiment at BEPCII (the only e + e \u2212 collider in the world operating in this energy region). 2. \u03c4 mass measurement at BES \u03c4 lepton, ?, 8 the most massive member of the charged lepton family, was a giant step toward establishing the present SM. In the past forty years, the \u03c4 lepton was a subject of extensive experimental study since it offers a unique place to test fundamental aspects of electroweak interactions. Within the frame of SM the e, \u00b5 and \u03c4 are all point particles and they have the same spin, electromagnetic and weak interactions except for the different masses. We usually refer to this as the lepton universality, which could be tested by comparing the reaction with the interactions of electrons and muons with the weak neutral current. With an assumption of m \u03bd\u03c4 = 0, the leptonic width in \u03c4 decays 10 is given by,",

In this energy region the only contamination of \u03c4 pair events comes from ordinary meson production and well understood purely electromagnetic processes. Above 3.67 GeV backgrounds from decays of charmed states grow rapidly. Another important advantage of the \u03c4 -charm region is the existence of two precisely known narrow resonances, J/\u03c8 and \u03c8(2S), which provide a very high rate signal to calibrate and monitor the detector performance.

It is clear that \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 production can be most easily measured by studying e + e \u2212 annihilation events with two charged particles, which have the possibilities of ee, e\u03c0, \u00b5\u00b5, \u00b5h and hh (h represents for a charged \u03c0 or K).

Their theoretical precisions so far are limited by the second order loop effects from the hadronic vacuum polarization. The uncertainties on \u03b1(M 2 Z ) and a \u00b5 , as indicated in Fig. 8, are dominated by the contribution from the R value with uncertainties of 15 \u223c 20% in the range of 1 \u2212 5 GeV. 34 Of importance is the \u03b1(M 2 Z ) plays a vital role in the determination of electroweak corrections relation to the mass of Higgs particle, which was finally discovered in 2012, 35,36 but as the only yet undiscovered particle in the SM at that time. An improved uncertainty for R value would help to determine \u03b1(s) and therefore result in improved constraint on the parameters of the Standard Model, also contribute to the interpretation of \u03b1 \u00b5 . From Fig. 8, the dominant uncertainty in \u03b1(M 2 Z ) comes from data in the energy range of 2 \u2212 5 GeV, thus making an improved measurement is critical for better accuracy. In the case of \u03b1 \u00b5 , a smaller contribution is possible, due to the fact that \u03b1 \u00b5 is more sensitive to lower energy data. However, this contribution may become important with the accumulation of lower energy data obtained from the CMD and SND experiments at VEPP-2M in Novosibirsk, and KLOE experiment at DA\u03a6NE in Frascati. With the previous e + e \u2212 experiments in the energy region of 2\u22125 GeV, the accuracy with which the absolute value of R can be measured was limited by systematic uncertainties. In view of its importance, it is essential to perform the R value measurement at the BES experiment because the BEPC just exactly operated in this energy region. Before the official proposal, we made a pre-study 37 using the data, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 5 pb \u22121 , collected near \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 threshold in 1992 for the \u03c4 mass measurement.

Separated beam running at each energy point was carried out in order to subtract the beam associated background from the data.

The salient features of the beam associated background are that their tracks are very much along the beam pipe direction, the energy deposited in BSC is small, and most of the tracks are protons. Therefore, most of them could be rejected by a vertex cut. With the same selection criteria as those for hadronic events, the remaining background events in the hadronic events, after normaliziation in accordance with the integrated beam currents for collision and separated beam runs, were subtracted directly in the calculation of the hadronic cross sections. For the 1999 fine scan data, there were some improvements in event selection and the numbers of hadronic events and beamassociated background events were determined by fitting the distribution of event vertices along the beam direction with a Gaussian to describe the hadronic events and a polynomial of degree one to three for the beam-associated background. 5 The trigger efficiencies are measured by comparing the responses to different trigger requirements in special runs taken at the J/\u03c8 resonance. 39 From the trigger measurements, the efficiencies for Bhabha, dimuon and hadronic events are deter-tau-r-bes mined to be 99.96%, 99.33% and 99.76%, respectively. As a cross check, the trigger information from the 2.6 and 3.55 GeV data samples is used to provide an independent measurement of the trigger efficiencies. This measurement is consistent with the efficiencies determined from the J/\u03c8 data. The errors in the trigger efficiencies for Bhabha and hadronic events are less than 0.5%. JETSET7.4 is used as the hadronic event generator to determine the detection efficiency for hadronic events. Parameters in the generator are tuned using a 4 \u00d7 10 4 hadronic event sample collected near 3.55 GeV for the \u03c4 mass measurement done by the BES Collaboration. 19,20 The parameters of the generator are adjusted to reproduce distributions of kinematic variables such as multiplicity, sphericity, transverse momentum, etc. However, the Monte Carlo simulation packet JETSET was not designed to fully describe few body states produced by e + e \u2212 annihilation in the few GeV energy region. A great effort has been made by the Lund group and BES collaboration to develop the formalism using the basic Lund Model area law directly for the Monte Carlo simulation, which is expected to describe the data better. 40  Figure 9 shows the comparison of hadronic event shapes between data and MC simulations, which indicates that the MC simulations could describe data well. The detection efficiency curve with respect of the center-of-mass energy is shown in Fig. 10.",

Above charm threshold, where resonances are important, the agreement is around 1 \u223c 3%. The major uncertainties common to all models are due to errors in previously measured R-values and in the choice of values for the resonance parameters. For the measurements reported here, we use the formalism of Ref. 43  The R values obtained at the 6 energy points scanned in 1998 and 85 energy points in 1999 are summarized in Table 2, respectively, and graphically displayed in Fig. 11, together with those measured by MarkI, \u03b3\u03b32, and Pluto. [30][31][32] The R values from BESII have an average uncertainty of about 6.6%, which represents a factor of two to three improvement in precision in the 2 to 5 GeV energy region. Of this error, 3.3% is common to all points. These improved measurements had a significant impact on the the global fit to the electroweak data and the determination of the SM prediction for the mass of the Higgs particle. 45 In addition, they provided an improvement in the precision of the calculated value of a SM \u00b5 , 46 and test the QCD sum rules down to 2 GeV. 47,48 In 2004, before BESII was shut down for the upgrade to BESIII, a high-statistics data sample was taken at 2.6, 3.07 and 3.65 GeV, with an integrated luminosity of 1222, 2291 and 6485 nb \u22121 , respectively. 49 The results are summarized in Table. 2. Compared with the previous results from BESII experiment, 5,38 the measurement precision was improved due to three main refinements to the analysis: (1) the simulation of BESII included both of the hadronic and electromagnetic interactions with a GEANT3 50 based package SIMBES 4 with a more detailed geometrical description and matter definition for the sub-detectors; (2) large data samples were taken at each energy point, with statistical errors smaller than 1%; (3) the selected hadronic event sample was expanded to include one-track events, which supplied more information to the tuning of LUARLW, and resulted in the improved values of parameters and hadronic efficiency. With these improvements, the errors on the new measured R values were reduced to about 3.5%.",

In the study of non-DD decay of \u03c8(3770), data samples at 3.65 GeV with a luminosity of 5.536 pb \u22121 and at 3.665 GeV with a luminosity of 998.2 nb \u22121 were collected, with which the hadronic events with more than 2-tracks (n ch \u2265 3) were selected, and the averaged R value was obtained as R = 2.218 \u00b1 0.019 \u00b1 0.089 with an error of 4.1%. 57 For the measurement of the resonant parameters of \u03c8(3770), a scan with 68 energy points in the energy region between 3.650 and 3.872 GeV was performed, and this data sample was used tau-r-bes \u03c4 mass and R value measurements at BES 17 for the R measurement as well, with an overall systematic uncertainty of 4.0 \u223c 4.9% and R uds = 2.141 \u00b1 0.025 \u00b1 0.085 for the continuum light hadron production near the DD threshold. 58 ",

            "text": "In addition, being one of the most fundamental parameters in particle physics, the R-value plays an important role in the development of the theory of particle physics and in the test of SM. Experimental efforts to precisely measure R values at low energies are crucial for the future electroweak precision physics. The BESII experiment performed energy scans in the energy region between 2 and 5 GeV, and the R values were measured at 6+85 energy points with an average uncertainty of 6.6%, representing a significant improvement in precision by a factor of 2 or 3 and thus a great impact on the determination of \u03b1(M 2 Z ). However, the present uncertainty on the R values in the low energy region of 2 \u2212 5 GeV is still at a level of \u223c6%, which should be further improved for the precision test of SM. The BESIII experiment is therefore absolutely crucial for a better determination of the R values in this energy region. A test run at 4 energies, 2.2324, 2.4, 2.8 and 3.4 GeV, with a total integrated luminosity about 12 pb \u22121 was carried out in 2011. Together with other data samples in the continuum for various projects, a feasibility study of R measurement at BESIII has been performed which shows a precision of \u223c 3% can be reached. Then a dedicated scan was done in the high energy region of 3.85 \u2212 4.6 GeV with \u223c 800 pb \u22121 at 104 energy points and at least 100k hadronic events at each point in the 2013 \u2212 2014 run, followed by a low energy scan in 2.0 \u2212 3.08 GeV with \u223c 525 pb \u22121 at 21 energy points in the 2014 \u2212 2015 run. These data samples make it possible for an improvement by a factor of 2 once again in the R measurement. Since the luminosity of BEPCII is two orders of magnitude higher than at BEPC, the scan of the resonance region will provide precise information on the 1 \u2212\u2212 charmonium states up to 4.6 GeV. The analysis is undergoing and the results will be presented in the near future, which will be very important in electroweak theory physics with regard to the R-values at low energy region.",

Therefore \u03c4 \u2212 charm physics will continue to be studied at facilities, such as BESIII, Belle-II.
