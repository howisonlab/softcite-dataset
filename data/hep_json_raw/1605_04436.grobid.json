The analysis is based on proton-proton collisions collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The data samples correspond to integrated luminosities of 71 and 44 pb \u22121 for |y| < 3 and 3.2 < |y| < 4.7, respectively. Jets are reconstructed with the anti-k t clustering algorithm for two jet sizes, R, of 0.7 and 0.4, in a phase space region covering jet p T up to 2 TeV and jet rapidity up to |y| = 4.7. Predictions of perturbative quantum chromodynamics at next-to-leading order precision, complemented with electroweak and nonperturbative corrections, are used to compute the absolute scale and the shape of the inclusive jet cross section. The cross section difference in R, when going to a smaller jet size of 0.4, is best described by Monte Carlo event generators with next-to-leading order predictions matched to parton showering, hadronisation, and multiparton interactions. In the phase space accessible with the new data, this measurement provides a first indication that jet physics is as well understood at \u221a s = 13 TeV as at smaller centreof-mass energies.",

            "text": "Quantum chromodynamics (QCD) is the fundamental theory describing strong interactions among partons, i.e.quarks and gluons. Inclusive jet production (p + p \u2192 jet + X) is a key process to test predictions of perturbative QCD (pQCD) over a wide region in phase space. To compare with measurements, the parton-level calculations must be complemented with corrections for nonperturbative (NP) effects that involve the modeling of hadronisation (HAD) and multiparton interactions (MPI). Previous measurements at the CERN LHC have been carried out by the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations at centre-of-mass energies \u221a s = 2.76 TeV [1,2], 7 TeV [3-* e-mail: cms-publication-committee-chair@cern.ch 7], and at lower \u221a s by experiments at other hadron colliders [8][9][10][11][12]. The measurements at 2.76 and 7 TeV centre-ofmass energies were found to be in agreement with calculations at next-to-leading order (NLO) in the strong coupling constant \u03b1 S over a wide range of jet transverse momentum p T and rapidity y. With the latest data from the LHC Run 2, these tests of pQCD are extended to cover the new energy regime of \u221a s = 13 TeV. In this paper, a measurement of the double-differential inclusive jet cross section is presented as a function of the jet p T and absolute jet rapidity |y|. The jets are clustered with the anti-k t jet algorithm [13] as implemented in the Fast-Jet library [14]. Two jet sizes R are used: the larger value R = 0.7 corresponds to the standard jet size chosen in most QCD jet analyses made by the CMS Collaboration because it favourably compares to fixed-order predictions [15]. A second, smaller value of R emphasizes different aspects of perturbative and nonperturbative QCD and permits complementary tests to be performed [16][17][18]. Moreover, the choice of R = 0.4 as a new CMS default jet size that replaces the previous one of 0.5 in LHC Run 1 analyses will allow direct comparisons between jet measurements made by ATLAS and CMS.",

The results are compared to fixed-order predictions at NLO precision, complemented with electroweak and nonperturbative corrections, and to predictions of various Monte Carlo (MC) event generators that combine leading-order (LO) or NLO pQCD with the modeling of parton showers (PS), HAD, and MPI.",

            "text": "The central feature of the CMS apparatus is a superconducting solenoid of 6 m internal diameter, providing a magnetic field of 3.8 T. Within the solenoid volume are a silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL), and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter (HCAL), each composed of a barrel and two endcap sections. Forward calorimeters extend the pseudorapidity (\u03b7) coverage provided by the barrel and endcap detectors to the region 3.0 < |y| < 5.2. Muons are measured in gasionisation detectors embedded in the steel flux-return yoke outside the solenoid. In the region |\u03b7| < 1.74, the HCAL cells have widths of 0.087 in \u03b7 and 0.087 radians in azimuth (\u03c6). In the \u03b7-\u03c6 plane, and for |\u03b7| < 1.48, the HCAL cells map onto 5 \u00d7 5 ECAL crystals arrays to form calorimeter towers projecting radially outwards from close to the nominal interaction point. At larger values of |\u03b7|, the size in rapidity of the towers increases and the matching ECAL arrays contain fewer crystals. Within each tower, the energy deposits in ECAL and HCAL cells are summed to define the calorimeter tower energies, subsequently used to provide the energies and directions of hadronic jets. The particle-flow (PF) event algorithm [19,20] reconstructs and identifies each individual particle with an optimised combination of information from the various elements of the CMS detector. The energy of photons is directly obtained from the ECAL measurement. The energy of electrons is determined from a combination of the electron momentum at the primary interaction vertex as determined by the tracker, the energy of the corresponding ECAL cluster, and the energy sum of all bremsstrahlung photons spatially compatible with originating from the electron track. The momentum of muons is obtained from the curvature of the corresponding track. The energy of charged hadrons is determined from a combination of their momenta measured in the tracker and the matching ECAL and HCAL energy deposits, corrected for zero-suppression effects and for the response function of the calorimeters to hadronic showers. Finally, the energy of neutral hadrons is obtained from the corresponding ECAL and HCAL energy. When combining information from the entire detector, the jet energy resolution typically amounts to 15 % at 10 GeV, 8 % at 100 GeV, and 4 % at 1 TeV, to be compared to about 40, 12, and 5 % obtained when the ECAL and HCAL alone are used. A more detailed description of the CMS detector, together with a definition of the coordinate system used and the relevant kinematic variables, can be found in Ref. [21].",

            "text": "The measurement is based on data samples collected with single-jet high-level triggers (HLT) [22]. Eight single-jet HLT paths are considered, seeded by Level 1 triggers based on calorimetric information. They require, in the full rapidity coverage of the CMS detector, at least one jet in each event with p T > 60, 80, 140, 200, 260, 300, 400, or 450 GeV. All triggers, except the one with the highest threshold, are prescaled. The relative efficiency of each trigger is estimated using lowerp T -threshold triggers, and found to exceed 99 % in the p T regions shown in Table 1. The absolute trigger efficiency is measured using a tag and probe method [23] based on events selected with a single-jet trigger threshold of 40 GeV, a back-to-back dijet system, and a probe jet matched to a HLT trigger object. This trigger has an efficiency greater than 99 % for selecting an event with a jet of p T > 80 GeV. The main physics objects in this analysis are PF jets, reconstructed by clustering the Lorentz vectors of the PF candidates with the anti-k t (AK) clustering algorithm for the two jet sizes R = 0.7 and 0.4 that will be referred to as AK7 and AK4, respectively. In order to reduce the contribution to the reconstructed jets from additional proton-proton interactions within the same or neighbouring bunch crossings (pileup), the technique of charged hadron subtraction [24] is used. Pileup produces unwanted calorimetric energy depositions and additional tracks. The charged hadron subtraction reduces these effects by removing charged particles that originate from pileup vertices. The average number of pileup interactions observed in these data is \u224819. During data collection the LHC operated with a 50 ns bunch spacing.",

The response matrix is derived from a simulation, that uses the theoretically predicted spectrum as input and introduces smearing effects by taking into account the jet p T resolution. The predicted spectrum is evaluated from fixed-order calculations based on the NLOJet++ v4.1.13 program [31,32] within the framework of the fastNLO v2.3.1 package [33], using the CT14 [34] parton distribution functions (PDF). More details are presented in Sect. 5.1. The jet p T resolution is evaluated with the CMS detector simulation based on Geant4 [35] using a QCD simulation from pythia8 with tune CUETM1, after correcting for the residual differences between data and simulation [23]. The unfolded distributions differ from the distributions at detector level by 5-20 %. The unfolding procedure can turn statistical fluctuations of the measured spectra into correlated patterns among the neighbouring bins. It has been verified that such effects are always within the statistical uncertainties of the unfolded distributions, which are larger than those of the detector-level distributions. The iterative unfolding procedure is regularized by limiting the number of iterations to four in each rapidity bin.",

The combinations of PDF sets, matrix element calculations, and UE tunes used to evaluate the NP corrections are validated on UE, minimum bias and jet variables, and they are able to reproduce a wide set of observables[26]. The NP corrections are shown inFigs. 1 and 2, respectively, for AK7 and AK4 jets in a central (0.5 < |y| < 1.0) and a forward rapidity bin (2.5 < |y| < 3.0). Fits to the nonperturbative corrections obtained for inclusive AK4 jet cross sections as a function of jet p The dotted lines represent the uncertainty bands, which are evaluated by fitting the envelopes of the predictions of the different generators used",
