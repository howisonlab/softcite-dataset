The barrel and endcap calorimeters are immersed in three LAr-filled cryostats, and are segmented into three layers for |\u03b7| < 2.5.

About 20% of photons at low |\u03b7| convert in the ID, and up to about 65% convert at |\u03b7| \u2248 2.3. The reconstruction of electrons and photons with |\u03b7| < 2.5 proceeds as shown in Figure 1. The algorithm first prepares the tracks and clusters it will use. It selects clusters of energy deposits measured in topologically connected EM and hadronic calorimeter cells [4], denoted topo-clusters, reconstructed as described in Section 4.1. These clusters are matched to ID tracks, which are re-fitted accounting for bremsstrahlung. The algorithm also builds conversion vertices and matches them to the selected topo-clusters. The electron and photon supercluster-building steps then run separately using the matched clusters as input. After applying initial position corrections and energy calibrations to the resulting superclusters, the supercluster-building algorithm matches tracks to the electron superclusters and conversion vertices to the photon superclusters. The electron and photon objects to be used for analyses are then built, their energies are calibrated, and discriminating variables used to separate electrons or photons from background are added.

[1], both to improve the reconstruction efficiency of double-track Si conversions (conversions reconstructed with two Si tracks), and to reduce the fraction of unconverted photons mistakenly reconstructed as single-or double-track TRT conversions (conversions reconstructed with one or two TRT tracks). The efficiency for double-track Si conversions was improved by modifying the tracking ambiguity processor, which determines which track seeds are retained to reconstruct tracks. For double-track conversion topologies, the two tracks are expected to be close to each other, parallel, and potentially to have shared hits, so that frequently only one track is reconstructed. The optimization in the ambiguity processor results in the recovery of the second track that was previously discarded. Overall, these modifications result in a 2-4% improvement in efficiency for double-track Si conversions, with larger improvements of up to 9% for photons with conversion radii larger than 200 mm. In addition to reconstructing the second track of what would otherwise have been single-track Si conversions, the overall conversion reconstruction efficiency is improved by about 1% by reducing the fraction of low-radius converted photons that are only reconstructed as electrons.",

More information about the variables and the identification methods are given in Sections 6 and 7 for electrons and photons, respectively. Figure 5 shows the reconstruction efficiencies for electrons. The reconstruction efficiency at high p T approaches the tracking efficiency, as expected. One interesting feature, however, is the difference between the efficiency to reconstruct the cluster and track (green triangles) and the efficiency to reconstruct an electron (purple inverted triangles) at lower p T . The reason for this is that tracks with silicon hits are considered for matching to superclusters only if they have had a GSF re-fit performed. The fixed-size clusters used for choosing the tracks on which the GSF re-fit is performed introduce an E T threshold, which is the source of this inefficiency. To alleviate this feature, the EM topo-clusters as defined in Section 4.1 could be used to seed the GSF fit.",

In absence of pile-up, an improvement in resolution of up to 20-30% is found in some bins in the endcap region of the detector, as well as in the central region for low-E T electrons. Similarly, a large improvement in the resolution is seen for converted photons, over 30% in a few bins. For unconverted photons, the overall change in performance is small, due to the generally narrower shower width. However, some improvement is observed for high E T bins in the endcap region.

For electrons and converted photons, the IQE of the supercluster reconstruction generally remains better, although the supercluster-based response is more sensitive to pile-up, as seen by its larger slope as a function of \u00b5 . Part of the reason is that the topo-cluster noise thresholds remain fixed even though \u00b5 changes. For unconverted photons, however, the supercluster reconstruction shows worse IQE for \u00b5 > 15.

The difference in \u03b1 i for the different years is mainly due to two effects: variations of the LAr temperature, and the increase of the instantaneous luminosity. The former effect induces a variation in the charge/energy collection, affecting the energy response by about -2%/K [33]. The latter implies an increased amount of deposited energy in the liquid-argon gap that creates a current in the high-voltage lines, reducing the high voltage effectively applied to the gap and introducing a variation of the response of up to 0.1% in the endcap region. A prediction of the different effects that can impact the results is presented in Ref. [3].

            "text": "The dependence of the constant term on the amount of pile-up, observed in Figure 9(b), is explained by the larger pile-up noise predicted by the simulation, compared with that observed in the data. Figure 11 shows an example of the evolution of the second central moment of the cell energy deposit in data and simulation as a function of \u00b5 for the second layer and 1.0 < |\u03b7| < 1.1 assuming \u03c6 symmetry. The contribution of the pile-up noise varies linearly with \u221a \u00b5, while the electronic noise remains constant. An average difference of 10% between the pile-up noise in data and simulation is observed. This mismodelling is absorbed in the c i parameters for electrons of E T \u223c 40 GeV, the average E T value for electrons from Z \u2192 ee decays used to derive the energy corrections. The two methods used for the extraction of the energy resolution corrections, described in Section 5.1, are compared and the full difference is taken as an uncertainty in the energy resolution. This uncertainty amounts to up to 0.2% in the barrel and is due to the different sensitivities of the two methods to the pile-up. The impact of a 10% difference in pile-up noise at a different energy is propagated to the energy resolution uncertainty relying on the predicted dependence of the pile-up noise effect as a function of the energy. For electrons and photons in the transverse energy range 30-60 GeV, the uncertainty in the energy resolution is of the order of 5% to 10%. In order to mimic the pile-up noise estimation in the simulation, the pile-up rescaling factor, described in Section 3, is changed from 1.03 to 1.2 for the 48b filling scheme and to 1.3 for the 8b4e filling scheme. A systematic uncertainty in the energy scale is derived comparing the results obtained with the two pile-up reweighting factors; it is of the order of 2 \u00d7 10 \u22124 in the barrel and of 5 \u00d7 10 \u22124 in the endcap. The total systematic uncertainty in the energy scale amounts to 4 \u00d7 10 \u22124 in the barrel and 2 \u00d7 10 \u22123 in the endcap.",

A data-driven validation of the photon energy scale corrections is performed using radiative decays of the Z boson, probing mainly the low-energy region. Residual energy scale factors for photons, \u2206\u03b1, are derived by comparing the mass distribution of the \u03b3 system in data and simulation after applying the Z-based energy scale corrections. The mass distribution of the \u03b3 system in the simulation is modified by applying \u2206\u03b1 to the photon energy and the value of \u2206\u03b1 that minimizes the \u03c7 2 comparison between the data and the simulation is extracted. If the energy calibration is correct, \u2206\u03b1 should be consistent with zero within the uncertainties described in Section 5.2. An alternative method based on a binned extended maximum-likelihood fit with an analytic function to describe the mass distribution is used, and gives consistent results. The electron and muon channels are analysed separately. In the electron channel, the electron energy scale uncertainty is accounted for in the determination of the residual photon energy scale.

The first uses an inclusive-photon production data selection, the second uses photons radiated from leptons in Z \u2192 \u03b3 decays, and the third uses electrons from Z \u2192 ee decays, with a method that transforms the electron shower shapes to resemble the photon shower shapes. These efficiency measurements are described in detail in Ref. [1], and summarized below. All three procedures measure photons that are isolated, using the Loose working-point definition (see Section 8.2). The three measurements use a common method to characterize the imperfect modelling of shower shapes in simulated samples, in order to estimate its impact on the efficiency measurement in data. Nominally, the MC shower shapes are compared with data in control regions enriched in real photons and corrected by applying a simple shift to the distributions, whose magnitude is determined by a \u03c7 2 minimization procedure. However, some data-MC differences cannot be corrected by this procedure, such as the widths of the distributions. In order to estimate any residual data-MC differences, the \u03c7 2 minimisation is repeated considering only the tail of the distribution, defined as the region containing 30% of the distribution on the side closer to the identification cut value. The shift value obtained when comparing the data and simulation tails is used to define a systematic uncertainty in the modelling of the shower shapes, and is derived for all variables for which a mismodelling is observed. Four variations are defined using sets of correlated variables; the variables within each set are shifted together: {R had }, {R \u03c6 }, {R \u03b7 ,w \u03b7 2 }, and {w s 3 , f side ,w s tot }. The result is equivalent to four sets of MC simulated samples, which can be used to assign systematic uncertainties for mismodelling effects that impact the data measurement, and which are considered to be uncorrelated variations.",

The matrix method constructs four regions by categorizing Loose photon candidates according to whether they pass or fail the Tight identification, and whether they pass or fail track-based isolation cuts. The four regions contain eight unknowns (i.e. the numbers of signal and background events in each region); if the isolation efficiencies for signal and background from each region are known, the efficiency for Loose photons to pass the Tight identification can be extracted. The isolation efficiencies for loosely and tightly identified signal photons are determined from the Monte Carlo samples, and the isolation efficiencies for backgrounds are obtained in a jet-enriched control region constructed by inverting identification criteria.

First, a closure test is performed to determine whether the transformed electrons can reproduce the expected photon efficiency, using the simulation and in the absence of background. The difference in relative efficiency, which can be as high as 3%, is applied as a correction to the measured data efficiency, and the magnitude of the correction is assigned as the systematic uncertainty. Systematic effects that affect the Smirnov transformations include the fraction of fragmentation photons in the simulated inclusive-photon sample, which is varied by \u00b150%, and the predicted fraction of true converted photons, which is varied by \u00b110%, to assess the impact of the imperfect simulation on the efficiency measurement. The uncertainty in the modelling of identification variables in simulation is assessed by defining Smirnov transformations for each of the four sets of variations of the shower shape modelling, recalculating the efficiency for each case; the total modelling uncertainty is taken as the sum in quadrature of the individual variations. The uncertainty due to the limited size of the MC samples used to derive the Smirnov transformations is assessed using the bootstrap method. Finally, the uncertainty associated with the subtraction of the W+jets and multijet backgrounds in the signal region is tested by reducing the level of background through a restriction of the selected invariant-mass range to 80 < m < 100 GeV, and repeating the measurement procedure. The resulting difference in the measured efficiency is taken as the systematic uncertainty.",

Data from Z \u2192 ee decays are used to reduce efficiency losses due to mismodelling of the input variables in the BDT training. Furthermore, additional input variables have been studied.",

These requirements minimize charge misidentification for this electron. Any additional reconstructed electron in the event is used to train the BDT, as a signal electron if it has an electric charge different from the first electron, and as a background electron if the electric charge is the same. To reduce background from converted photons from initial-or final-state radiation, the invariant mass of any pairs of electrons must lie within 5 GeV of 90 GeV in opposite-charge events and within 5 GeV of 88 GeV in same-charge events. The lower value used in same-charge events accounts for the fact that electrons with the incorrect charge have a higher probability for energy loss as discussed in Section 9.2 and illustrated in Figure 30(a).",

This approach allows measurements in 5 bins in E T and 14 bins in \u03b7 with reasonable statistical precision from a sample of approximately 9000 electrons with the incorrect charge assignment (for Tight identification). The systematic uncertainty in the parameterization is assessed by comparing, double differentially, the ratio of same-charge events and opposite-charge events, weighted with the charge misreconstruction probability, in data and simulation.

In Figure 30(b), the charge misidentification probability is shown as a function of the energy response, (p reco T \u2212 p true T )/p true T , in several bins of \u03b7. It increases with the difference between true and reconstructed electron energy. The same effect causes the differences in reconstructed invariant mass between opposite-charge and same-charge events shown in Figure 30(a). The correlation with the energy response complicates the measurement of charge misidentification probabilities in data. The probability measurement is blind as to which of the two electrons has the incorrect charge assignment. Hence, the probabilities determined from the likelihood maximization are used to form data-to-simulation probability ratios. No significant dependence of the data-to-simulation ratios on the dilepton invariant mass has been observed. The charge misidentification probabilities in data are obtained by multiplying the datato-simulation probability ratios by the charge misidentification probabilities computed in the simulation, where the electron with the incorrect charge assignment is unambiguous. The probabilities in data are shown in Figure 31 for several combinations of identification and isolation operating points. For Medium identification with Tight isolation, the electron charge misidentification probability in Z \u2192 ee events is  Figure 30: (a) Dielectron invariant mass distribution of events from Z \u2192 ee production used for the measurement of electron charge misidentification efficiencies.

As a function of E T it increases approximately linearly from 0.28% at E T = 20 GeV to 1.7% at E T = 120 GeV. With Tight instead of Medium identification, a reduction of charge misidentification by 25%-50%, depending on E T and \u03b7, is seen. The BDT presented in Section 9.1 further reduces the misidentification probability by factor of about five, on average over the detector acceptance, and by up to a factor 10 at high pseudorapidity. . The energies of the electrons have been corrected for the energy loss in the interaction with the detector material, which is the primary source of charge misidentification.
