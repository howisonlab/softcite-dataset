One of the important objectives of the experiment is the exploration of the transverse spin structure of the nucleon via spin dependent azimuthal asymmetries in single-hadron production in deep inelastic scattering of polarized leptons off transversely polarized target. For this purpose a series of measurements were made in COMPASS, using 160 GeV/c longitudinally polarized muon beam and transversely polarized 6 LiD (in 2002, 2003  and 2004)  and NH 3 (in 2007 and 2010) targets.",

The equation (1) counts in total eight: five Single-Spin (SSA) and three Double-Spin (DSA) target transverse polarization dependent asymmetries. Since the sin\u03b8 is rather small quantity in COMPASS kinematics (see Fig.1) influence of the additional terms and factors can be neglected in case of all the asymmetries except for A cos \u03d5 S LT DSA, which, even taking into account suppression by a sin\u03b8 scale-factor, is still sizably affected by large A LL amplitude [9]. In Fig.1 the theoretical curves for A LL , evaluated based on [10] and used for the correction of A cos \u03d5 S LT asymmetry, are compared with the COMPASS data points [9], demonstrating close agreement.",
