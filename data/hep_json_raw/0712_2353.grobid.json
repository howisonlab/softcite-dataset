Most proposed techniques involve interference between the Cabibbo-suppressed but CKM-favored b \u2192 c\u016bs-tree-mediated B \u2212 \u2192 K ( * )\u2212 D ( * )0 decay with the CKM-disfavored b \u2192 ucs-tree-mediated B \u2212 \u2192 K ( * )\u2212D ( * )0 decay. Here, since the amplitude for the latter decay is suppressed relative to the former both by a CKM factor of |V * ub V cs /V * cb V us | \u223c 0.38 and a color-suppression factor estimated to be in the range 0.1 \u223c 0.2, the expected CP asymmetries are expected to be small. The most promising technique 11 for measuring \u03c6 3 uses differences in the K S \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 Dalitz-plot densities between B + and B \u2212 decays to \"D 0 \"K \u00b1 , with \"D 0 \" \u2192 K S \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 . The gist of the technique is as follows. Assuming no CP asymmetry in the D 0 \u2192 K S \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decay, the amplitude for a \" each mode are extracted from the fit parameters. The value for \u03c6 3 in the range 0 \u2264 \u03c6 3 \u2264 180 o for three combined modes is \u03c6 3 = 53 0 +15 0 \u221218 0 (stat) \u00b1 3 0 (syst) \u00b1 9 0 (model). A difficulty is the sensitivity of the measured \u03c6 3 value to r, which is measured to be small and only \u223c 3\u03c3 from zero. For the K \u00b1 D mode the measured value is r = 0.159 +0.054 \u22120.050 \u00b1 0.013 \u00b1 0.049. The current experimental situation involving tree diagrams is succinctly summarized in the two plots from the UTfit group 13 shown in Fig. 2. The plot on the left shows constraints in the\u03c1-\u03b7 plane using all measurements other than those of the Unitary Triangle angles. The plot on the right shows the constraints that derive only from measurements of \u03c6 1 , \u03c6 2 and \u03c6 3 . The fact that both sets of measurements pick out the same allowed region in \u03c1 and \u03b7 is striking evidence for the validity of the KM anzatz. A second striking feature that is evident from these plots is that, in spite of the limited precision of the \u03c6 2 measurement and the primitive state of the \u03c6 3 measurement, the constrains from the angle measurements are more stringent than those from all other measurements. Part of the reason for this is the theoretical cleanliness of the angle measurements. In addition to improving the precision, especially on \u03c6 2 and \u03c6 3 , which can be done with increased statistics, the next step is to measure the same angles using processes involving loop (or penguin) diagrams. Such measurements are very sensitive probes for new non-SM physics. In the SM, the loop processes are dominated by W bosons and t-quarks, two of the SM's most massive particles. Thus, effects of non-SM particles in the loop on CP -violating phases can be large even for masses of order TeV or higher, i.e. beyond the reach of the LHC. In this program, \u03c6 i values determined from measurements of tree processes provide precise and theoretically robust benchmarks against which to compare the loop process measurements.",

For many b \u2192 s penguin processes, such as B 0 \u2192 \u03c6K 0 , the experimental circumstances are nearly identical to those for B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8K 0 and, so, comparisons can be made with small systematic uncertainties. The main issue is statistics: the branching fractions for b \u2192 s decays are usually about 1% that for J/\u03c8K 0 . Belle has made measurements of sin 2\u03c6 ef f 1 for an assortment of b \u2192 s CP eigenstate modes. 6,14 The \u2212\u03be f \u2206t-dependent asymmetries for the \u03b7 \u2032 K 0 and \u03c6K 0 modes are shown in Figs. 3(a) and (b), respectively; CP -violating asymmetries are evident in both cases. For these modes, sin 2\u03c6 ef f 1 is found to be +0.64 \u00b1 0.10(stat)\u00b1 0.04(syst) (\u03b7 \u2032 K 0 ) and +0.50 \u00b1 0.21(stat) \u00b1 0.06(syst) (\u03c6K 0 ). In both cases there is good consistency with sin 2\u03c6 1 from B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8K 0 . Measurements for other b \u2192 s modes indicate no dramatic deviation from the SM expectation but with poorer statistical precision. The implication is that any new physics that may be accessible at the LHC has to be carefully hidden from the quark-flavor sector.",
