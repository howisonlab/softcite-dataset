            "text": "use of calorimeter timing has so far been limited to searches targeting displaced photons at \u221a s = 8 TeV [26,27]. The present study represents the first application of ECAL timing to a search for nonprompt jets from long-lived particle decays. This technique allows the reduction of background contributions to the few event level, while retaining high efficiency for signal signatures of one or more displaced jets and p miss T in the final state. As detailed in Ref. [28], this approach brings significant new sensitivity to long-lived particle searches. A diagram of a characteristic event targeted by this analysis is shown in Fig. 1 (lower figure). Such an event would escape reconstruction in a tracker-based search because of the difficulty in reconstructing tracks that originate from decay points separated from the primary vertex by more than \u223c50 cm in the plane perpendicular to the beam axis. There are two effects that contribute to the time delay of jets from the decay of heavy longlived particles. First, the indirect path, composed of the initial longlived particle and the subsequent jet trajectories, will be longer, and second, the long-lived particle will move with a lower velocity owing to its high mass. The latter is the dominant effect for the signal models considered in this analysis.",

For nonisolated particles with 1 < p T < 10 GeV, in the region |\u03b7| < 1.4, the track resolutions are typically 1.5% in p T and 25-90 (45-150) \u03bcm in the transverse (longitudinal) impact parameter [29]. The HCAL is segmented into individual calorimeter cells along pseudorapidity (\u03b7), azimuth (\u03c6), and depth. The barrel muon system is composed of drift-tubes (DTs) and resistive plate chambers (RPCs). These provide high resolution hit positioning and timing to determine the muon trajectory. The hits in the DTs are clustered into track segments, referred to as DT segments, as detailed in Ref. [30]. In the forward region, RPCs are used along with cathode strip chambers (CSCs), which have greater resistance to the higher radiation flux occurring along the beamline than DTs. A more detailed description of the CMS detector, together with a definition of the coordinate system used and the relevant kinematical variables, can be found in Ref. [9].",

In the \u03b7-\u03c6 plane, and for |\u03b7| < 1.48, the HCAL cells map on to 5\u00d75 arrays of ECAL crystals to form calorimeter towers projecting radially outwards from close to the nominal interaction point. For |\u03b7| > 1.74, the coverage of the towers increases progressively to a maximum of 0.174 in \u03b7 and \u03c6. Within each tower, the energy deposits in ECAL and HCAL cells are summed to define the calorimeter tower energies, subsequently used to provide the energies and directions of hadronic jets. Events of interest are selected using a two-tiered trigger system [32]. The first level, composed of custom hardware processors, uses information from the calorimeters and muon detectors to select events at a rate of around 100 kHz within a time interval of less than 4 \u03bcs. The second level, known as the high-level trigger (HLT), consists of a farm of processors running a version of the full event reconstruction software optimized for fast processing, and reduces the event rate to around 1 kHz before data storage.",

A requirement on the ECAL energy component of the jet of E ECAL > 20 GeV is applied as this threshold was found to optimize the timing resolution of the jets while ensuring high signal efficiency. Jets from signal events are expected to have a large number of ECAL cells (N cell ECAL ) hit, while jets dominated by direct APD hits or ECAL noise often have a low number of cells hit. A threshold of N cell ECAL > 25 is applied to reject these background sources. Jets from signal events will typically have similar energy depositions in the ECAL and HCAL, while jets originating from noise or beam halo typically have a small or zero HCAL energy component (E HCAL ). In order to reject such background sources, jets are required to have a hadronic energy fraction HEF = E HCAL /(E ECAL + E HCAL ) > 0.2. An additional requirement of E HCAL > 50 GeV is made to reject background contributions from noise and beam halo as well as to ensure a well-measured hadronic component. Signal jets typically have a small RMS in the time of the constituent cells (t RMS jet ) as all the component cells originate from the same delayed jet. Jets that are significantly delayed because of contributions from uncorrelated noise often contain cells that are widely spread in time. In such cases the t RMS jet will be correlated with t jet , so a requirement is made on both t RMS jet < 0.4t jet and t RMS jet < 2.5 ns. Jets that originate from a PV and have a mismeasured time or originate from satellite bunch collisions typically contain significant total momentum in tracks associated with their PV. The PV fraction track , defined as the ratio of the total p T of all PV tracks matched to the jet ( R < 0.5) to the transverse calorimeter energy of the jet, is used to select potential signal jets that do not originate from a PV. A requirement of PV fraction track < 0.08 is applied.",

To enhance the contribution of beam halo events relative to the contributions from satellite bunches and cosmic ray muons in the VR, the \u03c6 values of the jets are required to be within 0.2 radians of 0 or \u00b1\u03c0 . The correlation between E CSC ECAL /E ECAL and HEF in the VR is consistent with zero, meaning they can be used to make an unbiased prediction. The prediction from this method for the number of events passing signal thresholds on E CSC ECAL /E ECAL and HEF in the VR is 0.02 +0.06 \u22120.02 events, in agreement with the 0 events observed.The level of agreement between prediction and observation in the VR is used to derive a systematic uncertainty in the prediction. The slope of a linear fit to the pass/fail ratio of the E CSC ECAL /E ECAL > 0.8 requirement as a function of HEF is found to be consistent with zero. The uncertainty is then propagated to the region with E CSC",
