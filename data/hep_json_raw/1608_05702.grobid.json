For single-shower topologies, the event distribution in production angle exhibits a clear excess above the estimated background at very forward angles for visible energy in the range 1-8 GeV. Cross sections are obtained for the detector medium comprised of 80% iron and 20% carbon nuclei with A = 48, the highest-A target used to date in the study of this coherent reaction. The total cross section for coherent neutral-current single-\u03c0 0 production initiated by the \u03bd\u00b5 flux of the NuMI low-energy beam with mean (mode) E\u03bd of 4.9 GeV (3.0 GeV), is 77.6 \u00b1 5.0 (stat) +15.0 \u221216.8 (syst) \u00d7 10 \u221240 cm 2 per nucleus. The results are in good agreement with predictions of the Berger-Sehgal model.",

These interactions can proceed either as neutral-current (NC) or charged-current (CC) processes in which the pion electric charge coincides with that of the Z 0 or W \u00b1 vector boson emitted by the leptonic current. Recent investigations, both experimental [2][3][4][5][6] and theoretical [7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16], have devoted attention to neutrino-induced NC coherent production of single \u03c0 0 mesons:",

The phenomenological model of Rein and Sehgal [18] invokes Adler's theorem to express the coherent cross section in terms of the \u03c0-nucleon scattering cross section. The original Rein-Sehgal model characterized coherent scattering at incident energies E \u03bd > 3 GeV, and served as a framework for development of other PCAC-based models of coherent \u03c0 0 production [7][8][9][10]. In particular, the Berger-Sehgal model [9] used in the present work improves upon Rein-Sehgal by using \u03c0-carbon scattering data rather than \u03c0nucleon data as the basis for extrapolation.",

The protons were directed onto a graphite target, producing large numbers of hadronic particles. The produced hadrons traversed two magnetic focusing horns whose current polarity was set to focus positively charged particles (mostly \u03c0 + and K + mesons), directing them into a 675 m long cylindrical decay pipe. Positioned downstream of the decay pipe was the hadron absorber, followed by 240 m of rock to stop the remaining muons. Along the first 40 m of rock there were three alcoves, each containing a plane of muon monitoring chambers that measured the muon flux.",

It is useful to divide the NC and CC-\u03bd \u00b5 categories according to the final-state hadronic processes used in MC modeling. The relevant processes are resonance production (RES) and deep inelastic scattering (DIS). Electromagnetic showering particles dominate the reconstructed shower in all of the background categories. Neutral-current reactions. The dominant background arises from non-coherent NC events with final-state neutral pions that deposit significant shower energy and little additional energy above the MINOS detection thresholds. Their final-state shower angles with respect to the beam, however, are more broadly distributed than those of NC(\u03c0 0 ) coherent scattering. CC-\u03bd \u00b5 reactions. There is a subset of CC-\u03bd \u00b5 events in which the muon track is not identified, and the hadronic shower is dominated by a single \u03c0 0 . CC-\u03bd e reactions. Beam \u03bd e (\u03bd e ) neutrinos can initiate events having single, prompt electrons (positrons) with no evidence of recoil nucleons or other hadronic activity. This CC-\u03bd e background is mainly composed of quasielastic (QE) scattering, however resonance production and DIS processes also contribute. The reconstructed energy distribution peaks at \u223c2.0 GeV, and extends more broadly to higher energies than the distribution of signal events. Evidence that the MC simulation accurately describes CC-\u03bd e quasielastic-like events is provided by the differential cross-section measurements of Ref. [46].",

The shower vertex and cluster of hits were required to be fully contained within the fiducial volume and to have visible energy above 1 GeV. Events with multiple showers, multiple tracks, or single tracks longer than 2 m were rejected. For events that passed the data quality and the fiducial volume containment requirements, the subsequent cut on visible energy removes an estimated 47% of coherent NC(\u03c0 0 ) events. Additional losses of signal are incurred by removal of events having multiple reconstructed showers or having muon-like topologies; the losses are at the subpercent level for each of the latter cuts. A cutoff was imposed on E vis at 8.0 GeV as few coherent events are predicted to occur above this value. Additionally, K-decay rather than muon decay begins to dominate CC-\u03bd e production above 8.0 GeV. This means that regions above 8.0 GeV are not predictive of background in the signal region and cannot be used as sidebands. This requirement is estimated to remove 2.9% from the total signal (including signal with E vis < 1.0 GeV).",

The SVM can accommodate large numbers of input variables whose information content carries various degrees of redundancy; its performance improves in accordance with the total amount of discriminatory information provided. For this analysis, thirty-one different reconstructed quantities were fed to the SVM for each event. The variables represented five categories of information: shower size, shower shape, shower fit, hadronic activity, and track fit.

To this end, selections are used to isolate a signal-enriched sample and to define two separate sideband samples. These selections are made in two stages. In the first stage, a piece-wise linear boundary is defined over the plane of SSP versus \u03b7 \u03c0 [49]. The boundary defines regions in such a way as to isolate samples enriched with certain desired properties. (The specifics of boundary placement are stated below.) Two such regions are defined, one contains the selected sample, and the other contains the near-SSP sample. In the second stage, the events of the two samples are re-binned as a function of cos \u03b8 shw -vs-E vis and are then separated into regions of high purity (the signal region) and of low purity (the sideband). The samples and the selection criteria are elaborated below. The selected sample: Events are chosen that populate a contiguous region of the SSP-vs-\u03b7 \u03c0 plane having highest purity and containing \u2265 10% of estimated coherent signal events.

For cos \u03b8 shw , its residual over the sample is nearly constant and so a constant bin-width of 0.04 is used. The MC templates, together with similar histograms of the data, are the principal inputs to the fit. Figure 6 shows the MC cos \u03b8 shw -vs-E vis distributions of selected-sample events for the signal (Fig. 6a) and for the background reaction categories: NC (Fig. 6b), CC-\u03bd e (Fig. 6c), and CC-\u03bd \u00b5 (Fig. 6d). Events enclosed by the solid-line border lie in the signal region while events lying outside belong to the sideband.

Strong correlations were also observed for the CC-\u03bd \u00b5 DIS and NC DIS templates.

Figure 10 shows the distributions in cos \u03b8 shw (Fig. 10a) and in \u03b7 \u03c0 (Fig. 10b) for all selected data. The predicted background (clear histogram) shows good agreement with the data points (solid circles) over the lower range (< 0.9) of cos \u03b8 shw and over the upper range (> 0.25) of \u03b7 \u03c0 . The signal for Reaction (1) emerges with either variable as the incident neutrino direction is approached, appearing as a data-minus-background excess (shaded histograms). The errors on the extracted signal are the quadrature sum of errors from the background fit plus statistical uncertainties of the data and MC. Signal events are accepted into the selected sample with an efficiency of 10.7%. (The total acceptance, accounting for loss due to the E vis < 1.0 GeV threshold cut, is estimated to be 4.6%). The correction to the measured event rate is implemented as prescribed by Eq. (10). Figure 11 shows the acceptance-corrected signal as a function of \u03b7 \u03c0 (shaded histogram) for all events having E vis > 1.0 GeV. Error bars on the binned signal are the quadrature sum of background uncertainties, statistical errors, and uncertainty with acceptance correction factors. In Fig. 11 the coherent-scattering signal is almost entirely confined to the range 0.0 < \u03b7 \u03c0 < 0.2 in agreement with the general trend predicted by the Berger-Sehgal model (dotted-line histogram). However the data exceed the model's prediction by nearly 2 \u03c3 for 0.0 < \u03b7 \u03c0 < 0.1, while falling below the prediction for 0.1 < \u03b7 \u03c0 < 0.2. These features suggest that the coherent interaction may be more sharply peaked towards \u03b7 \u03c0 = 0 The largest uncertainty of N Coh arises from the estimation and subtraction of background events. The constraints on the normalization and systematic parameters obtained from the fit to the sidebands are the 1\u03c3 confidence intervals extracted from the profiled 1-D \u2206\u03c7 2 distributions. The uncertainty due to the background subtraction is calculated from the minimum and maximum background rates allowed by the fit-parameter ranges. Propagation of the 1\u03c3 CL interval limits on the background to the final measurement results in an error band of (+11.6%, -14.4%).",

An estimation of this sizable correction is provided by the Berger-Sehgal based extrapolation indicated by Fig. 3b: \u22121 thr = 2.38. However, the uncertainty on \u22121 thr needs to be ascertained.

The range of plausible alternative shapes for the Berger-Sehgal distribution for E vis < 1.0 GeV that are compatible with the MINER\u03bdA data, implies an uncertainty range for \u22121 thr . A complication is that the MINER\u03bdA data is coherent scattering on carbon, while the scaling factor illustrated by Fig. 3b is calculated for coherent scattering on iron and carbon, so there is uncertainty arising from possible A-dependence of the E vis distribution. The uncertainty in going from carbon to iron was estimated by comparing to the Rein-Sehgal model (GENIE implementation), and additionally by running the Berger-Sehgal model with variations to input values from pion-nucleus scattering data. The A-dependence uncertainty is found to be the main contributor to the uncertainty for \u22121 thr . An uncertainty of \u00b113.0% is assigned, as listed in the bottom row of Table IV. The total coherent cross section, A-averaged over the MINOS medium and flux-averaged with E \u03bd of 4.9 GeV, is \u03c3 = 77.6 \u00b1 5.0 (stat) +15.0 \u221216.8 (syst) \u00d7 10 \u221240 cm 2 /nucleus.",

Cross section versus E\u03bd and A As shown by Table I, the MINOS measurement examines NC(\u03c0 0 ) coherent scattering in an E \u03bd -A region that lies outside of the range probed by previous experiments. For the purpose of eliciting the E \u03bd dependence, the previously reported cross sections (see Table I) are scaled to an A = 48 nucleus using the Berger-Sehgal model. (The 15-ft Bubble Chamber and SciBooNE cross section measurements are reported as fractions of the Rein-Sehgal cross sections for neon [28] and for carbon [5,6] respectively.) The scaled cross-section values are plotted in Fig. 12 together with the A-averaged MINOS measurement (solid star). For purposes of display, the E \u03bd interval of the measurement is taken to be the interval on either side of 4.9 GeV which includes 34% of the neutrino flux. Also shown in Fig. 12 is the prediction for A = 48 of the Berger-Sehgal model (dashed curve). Figures 12 and 13 show that the ensemble of cross-section measurements for Reaction (1), when subjected to \"normalization\" to common A or E \u03bd , exhibit power-law growth with increasing neutrino energy for fixed A, or with increasing target nucleon number for fixed E \u03bd .

(The extrapolations via Berger-Sehgal to pure iron and carbon targets listed in Table V are not plotted.) The high-A MINOS result is consistent with the trend predicted by PCAC models [59]. In rough terms, the A-dependence in the Berger-Sehgal model for E vis > 1.0 GeV arises from a convolution of three effects. The coherent nature of the interaction gives an A 2 dependence, but that is diminished by the nuclear form factor and by pion absorption. The former falls off as exp(\u2212A 2/3 ), and the latter as exp(\u2212A 1/3 ). These effects combine to yield a total cross section with an approximate A 2/3 dependence.",

Using a low-energy NuMI beam exposure of 2.8\u00d710 20 POT with mean (mode) E \u03bd of 4.9 GeV (3.0 GeV), a signal sample comprised of 9,550 +1,200 \u22121,590 events having final-state E vis > 1.0 GeV has been isolated. The corresponding flux-averaged, Aaveraged partial cross section for events above the analysis E vis threshold of 1.0 GeV is presented in Eq. (11). Extrapolation of the E vis distribution from the analysis 1.0 GeV threshold to zero yields the total coherent scattering cross section. The flux-averaged, A-averaged total cross section is given in Eq. (12). Its value is \u03c3 = (77.6 +15.8 \u221217.5 ) \u00d7 10 \u221240 cm 2 per nucleus. The various neutrino-nucleus NC(\u03c0 0 ) coherent scattering cross sections that are measured or inferred from this work are listed in Table V. The measurements of coherent scattering Reaction (1) reported here are the first to utilize a target medium of average nucleon number A > 30, and the cross section results of Eqs. (11) and (12) are for coherent scattering at the highest average nucleon number obtained by any experiment to date. Figures 12  and 13 show that these cross sections, as with previous measurements on lighter nuclear media and at lower and higher E \u03bd values, exhibit the general trends predicted by the Berger-Sehgal coherent scattering model which is founded upon PCAC phenomenology.",

The generation of mock data for the latter simulated experiments is more elaborate than for the SSMD experiments. As with SSMD experiments, each mock data sample pro-vides a population of events extending over the cos \u03b8 shwvs-E vis plane, binned in the same way as for the observed data. However with the full mock data samples, the background templates are adjusted to reflect random fluctuations in each systematic parameter, and the coherent signal content was varied by adjusting the normalization of the signal model over the range \u00b150%. Statistical fluctuations are applied to the event totals in each bin after the templates are combined. The entire background fitting and signal extraction procedure is executed on an ensemble of these mock data samples. Each mock data \"experiment\" yields a set of best-fit values for the fit parameters, a best-fit \u03c7 2 , and an acceptance-corrected event rate N f it , to be compared to the \"true\" signal assumed for the simulated experiment, N input .  Figure 14 shows the distribution of N f it \u2212 N input for an ensemble of mock data experiments. The 1\u03c3 width, defined as the region about the peak that includes 68% of the area, was shown to be independent of the input signal normalization. This metric serves as an estimate of the \u00b11\u03c3 confidence interval for the final fit procedure, and is measured to be \u00b115.8%. This estimate serves as a cross-check of the uncertainties on the measured signal event rate derived from fitting the data.",
