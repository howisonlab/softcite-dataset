Measurements of isolated-photon plus jets cross sections are presented as functions of the photon and jet transverse momenta. The cross sections as functions of the azimuthal angle between the photon and the jets, the azimuthal angle between the jets, the photon-jet invariant mass and the scattering angle in the photon-jet centre-of-mass system are presented. The pattern of QCD radiation around the photon and the leading jet is investigated by measuring jet production in an annular region centred on each object; enhancements are observed around the leading jet with respect to the photon in the directions towards the beams. The experimental measurements are compared to several different theoretical calculations, and overall a good description of the data is found.",

The measurements of the angular correlations between the photon and the jets can be used to probe the dynamics of the hard-scattering process. Since the dominant production mechanism in pp collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) proceeds via the qg \u2192 q\u03b3 process, measurements of prompt-photon plus jet production are useful in constraining the gluon density in the proton [1,2]. These mea-surements can also be used to tune the Monte Carlo (MC) models and to test t -channel quark exchange [3].",

The direct and fragmentation contributions are only well defined at LO; at higher orders such distinction is no longer possible. Measurements of prompt-photon production in a final state with accompanying hadrons require isolation of photons to avoid the large contribution from neutral-hadron decays into photons. The production of inclusive isolated photons in pp collisions was studied by the ATLAS [6-9] and CMS [10,11] collaborations. The cross section for isolated photons in association with jets as a function of the photon transverse energy 1 (E \u03b3 T ) in different regions of rapidity of the highest-p T jet was measured by ATLAS [12]. The production of isolated photons in association with jets was also measured by CMS [13][14][15].",

The variable \u03b8 * coincides with the scattering angle in the centre-of-mass frame for collinear scattering of massless particles, and its distribution is sensitive to the spin of the exchanged particle. For processes dominated by t -channel gluon exchange, such as dijet production in pp collisions, the cross section behaves as (1 \u2212 | cos \u03b8 * |) \u22122 when | cos \u03b8 * | \u2192 1. In contrast, processes dominated by t -channel quark exchange, such as W/Z + jet production, are expected to have an asymptotic (1 \u2212 | cos \u03b8 * |) \u22121 behaviour. This prediction from QCD can be tested in photon plus jet production in high-energy hadron-hadron collisions. The direct-photon contribution, as shown in Fig. 1(a), is expected to exhibit a (1 \u2212 | cos \u03b8 * |) \u22121 dependence when | cos \u03b8 * | \u2192 1, whereas that of fragmentation processes, as shown in Fig. 1(b), is predicted to be the same as in dijet production, namely (1 \u2212 | cos \u03b8 * |) \u22122 . For both processes, there are also s-channel contributions which are, however, non-singular when | cos \u03b8 * | \u2192 1. At higher orders, direct processes such as qq \u2192 qq\u03b3 are dominated by t -channel gluon exchange and contribute to the distribution in | cos \u03b8 * | with a component similar to that of fragmentation. However, a measurement of the cross section for prompt-photon plus jet production as a function of | cos \u03b8 * | is still sensitive to the relative contributions of the direct and fragmentation components and allows a test of the dominance of the t -channel quark exchange, such as that shown in Fig. 1(a).",

The analysis is performed using a dataset with an integrated luminosity 1 ATLAS uses a right-handed coordinate system with its origin at the nominal interaction point (IP) in the centre of the detector and the z-axis along the beam pipe. The x-axis points from the IP to the centre of the LHC ring, and the y-axis points upwards. Cylindrical coordinates (r, \u03c6) are used in the transverse plane, \u03c6 being the azimuthal angle around the z-axis. The pseudorapidity is defined in terms of the polar angle \u03b8 as \u03b7 = \u2212 ln tan(\u03b8/2). Angular distance is measured in units of R \u2261 ( \u03b7) 2 + ( \u03c6) 2 . The rapidity is defined as y = 0.5 ln[(E + p z )/(E \u2212 p z )], where E is the energy and p z is the z-component of the momentum, and transverse energy is defined as E T = E sin \u03b8 . . In addition, the azimuthal angles between the photon and each jet ( \u03c6 \u03b3 \u2212jet2 , \u03c6 \u03b3 \u2212jet3 ) and between the jets ( \u03c6 jet1-jet2 , \u03c6 jet1-jet3 , \u03c6 jet2-jet3 ) are measured for photon plus two-and three-jet events [19,20]. The production of jet2 around the photon and jet1 is measured separately to investigate the differences between the two configurations. The scale evolution of the photon plus one-jet system is studied by measuring the cross sections as functions of cos \u03b8 * in different regions of m \u03b3 \u2212jet1 . For photon plus two-and three-jet events, the scale evolution is investigated by measuring the angular correlations in different regions of E \u03b3 T . The predictions from the event generators PYTHIA [21] and SHERPA [22] are compared with the measurements. The next-to-leading-order (NLO) QCD predictions from JETPHOX [23,24] are compared with the photon plus one-jet measurements, whereas those from BLACKHAT [25,26] are compared with the photon plus two-jet and photon plus three-jet measurements.",

The clusters matched to charged-particle tracks, based on the distance in (\u03b7, \u03c6) between the cluster barycentre and the track impact point extrapolated to the second layer of the LAr calorimeter, are classified as electron candidates. Those clusters without matching tracks are classified as unconverted photon candidates, and clusters matched to pairs of tracks originating from reconstructed conversion vertices in the inner detector or to single tracks with no hit in the innermost layer of the pixel detector are classified as converted photon candidates [30]. From MC simulations, 96% of prompt photons with E \u03b3 T > 25 GeV are expected to be reconstructed as photon candidates, while the remaining 4% are incorrectly reconstructed as electrons but not as photons. The efficiency to reconstruct photon conversions decreases at high E \u03b3 T (>150 GeV), where it becomes more difficult to separate the two tracks from the conversions. Such conversions with very nearby tracks are often not recovered as single-track conversions because of the tighter selections applied to single-track conversion candidates. The overall photon reconstruction efficiency is thus reduced to about 90% for E \u03b3 T \u223c 1 TeV [30]. The energy measurement is performed using calorimeter and tracking information. A dedicated energy calibration [31] is applied separately for converted and unconverted photon candidates to account for upstream energy loss and both lateral and longitudinal leakage.",

The inputs to the jet reconstruction are three-dimensional topological clusters of calorimeter cells. This method first clusters topologically connected calorimeter cells and classifies these clusters as either electromagnetic or hadronic. The classification uses a local cluster weighting (LCW) calibration scheme based on cell-energy density and longitudinal depth within the calorimeter [35]. Based on this classification, energy corrections derived from single-pion MC simulations are applied. Dedicated corrections are derived for the effects of the non-compensating response of the calorimeter, signal losses due to noise-suppression threshold effects, and energy lost in non-instrumented regions. The jet four-momenta are computed from the sum of the topological cluster four-momenta, treating each as a four-vector with zero mass. These jets are referred to as detector-level jets. The direction of the jet is then corrected such that the jet originates from the selected primary vertex of the event. Prior to the final calibration, the contribution from the underlying event and pile-up is subtracted on a jet-by-jet basis using the jet-area method. An additional jet-energy calibration is derived from MC simulations as a correction relating the calorimeter response to the true jet energy. To determine these corrections, the jet reconstruction procedure applied to the topological clusters is also applied to the generated stable particles, which are defined as those with a lifetime \u03c4 longer than 10 ps, including muons and neutrinos; these jets are referred to as particle-level jets. In addition, sequential jet corrections, derived from MC simulated events and using global properties of the jet such as tracking information, calorimeter energy deposits and muon spectrometer information, are applied [36]. Finally, the detector-level jets are further calibrated with additional correction factors derived in situ from a combination of \u03b3 + jet, Z + jet and dijet balance methods [35,37].",

The isolation transverse energy at particle level is denoted by E iso T,part . The particle-level requirement on E iso T,part was determined using the PYTHIA and SHERPA MC samples, by comparing the calorimeter isolation transverse energy with the particle-level isolation on an event-by-event basis. The effect of the experimental isolation requirement used in the data is close to a particle-level requirement of E iso T,part < 10 GeV over the measured E \u03b3 T range. The measured cross sections refer to particle-level jets and photons that are isolated by requiring E iso T,part < 10 GeV.

Therefore, in each case, the shape of the total MC distribution depends on the relative fraction of the two contributions. To improve the description of the data by the PYTHIA MC samples, a fit [3] to each data distribution is performed with the weight of the hard contribution, \u03b1, as the free parameter; the weight of the brem contribution is given by 1 \u2212 \u03b1. The fitted values of \u03b1 are in the range 0.26-0.86. After these fits, a good description of the data is obtained from the PYTHIA MC simulations for all the observables, except for the distributions in the azimuthal angle between the jets. The simulations of SHERPA give a good description of the data, except for the tail of the distributions in E \u03b3 T . The integrated efficiency, including the effects of trigger, reconstruction, particle identification and event selection, is evaluated from the simulated signal samples described in Section 4. The integrated efficiency is computed as \u03b5 = N det,part /N part , where N det,part is the number of MC events that pass all the selection requirements at both the detector and particle levels and N part is the number of MC events that pass the selection requirements at the particle level. The integrated efficiency using SHERPA (PYTHIA) is found to be 81.3% (81.5%) for the photon plus one-jet, 74.6% (75.3%) for the photon plus two-jet and 70.2% (70.6%) for the photon plus three-jet sample.",

The correction factor, C NLO , is defined as the ratio of the cross section for jets of hadrons with UE to that for jets of partons. The correction factors for the photon plus one-jet predictions are estimated using the PYTHIA samples (using cone isolation) and those for the photon plus two/three-jet predictions are estimated using the SHERPA samples; in the latter case, the cone (Frixione) isolation is used at the particle (parton) level to match the measurements (predictions). The MC samples of PYTHIA (SHERPA) are suited for estimating the correction factors for JETPHOX (BLACKHAT) since these NLO QCD calculations include (do not include) the fragmentation contribution. These factors are close to unity for the photon plus one-jet observables, except for p jet1 T 500 GeV, where they can differ by up to 30% from unity due to the dominance of the bremsstrahlung component in that region. For photon plus two-jet (three-jet) observables the average correction factor is 1.10 (1.14).",

Fig. 10 shows the cross sections as functions of \u03c6 \u03b3 \u2212jet2 and \u03c6 jet1-jet2 for the two E \u03b3 T ranges: both cross-section distributions have different shapes for E \u03b3 T below/above 300 GeV. The d\u03c3/d \u03c6 \u03b3 \u2212jet2 cross section is more peaked towards large values of \u03c6 \u03b3 \u2212jet2 for E \u03b3 T > 300 GeV than that for E \u03b3 T < 300 GeV; the d\u03c3/d \u03c6 jet1-jet2 cross section peaks at \u03c6 jet1-jet2 \u223c 0.8 rad (2.2 rad) for E \u03b3 T > 300 GeV (E \u03b3 T < 300 GeV). The NLO QCD predictions give a good description of the data and, in particular, reproduce the scale evolution of the measured cross sections. Fig. 11 shows the comparison of the data and the predictions from PYTHIA and SHERPA. The predictions from PYTHIA fail to describe the data whereas those from SHERPA describe well the shape of the measured cross-section distributions and their evolution with the scale. Fig. 12(a) shows the cross sections for photon plus two-jet production as functions of \u03b2 jet1 and \u03b2 \u03b3 . The two measured cross sections have different shapes: the measured crosssection d\u03c3/d\u03b2 jet1 increases monotonically as \u03b2 jet1 increases, whereas the measured cross-section d\u03c3/d\u03b2 \u03b3 increases up to \u03b2 \u03b3 \u2248 1.8 rad and then remains approximately constant. The predictions from SHERPA give a good description of the measured cross sections. To quantify the differences in the patterns of jet production around the photon and jet1, the ratio of the measured cross-sections d\u03c3/d\u03b2 jet1 and d\u03c3/d\u03b2 \u03b3 is made. In the estimation of the systematic uncertainties of the ratio of the cross sections, the correlations between numerator and denominator are fully taken into account leading to complete or partial cancellations depending on the source of uncertainty. The ratio (d\u03c3/d\u03b2 jet1 )/(d\u03c3/d\u03b2 \u03b3 ), shown in Fig. 12(b), is enhanced at \u03b2 = 0 and \u03c0 rad with respect to the value of the ratio at \u03b2 = \u03c0/2 rad. The measured ratio is tested against the hypothesis of being independent of \u03b2 and the resulting p-value is 1.3%. Thus, it is observed, for the first time, that the patterns of QCD radiation around the photon and jet1 are different.",
