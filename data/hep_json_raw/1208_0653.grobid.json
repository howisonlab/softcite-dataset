The mass of the Higgs boson (M H ) is a free parameter in the SM that must be constrained by experimental results.

The region 147 < M H < 179 GeV is excluded by the combined analysis of the CDF and D0 Collaborations [8]. The ATLAS and CMS Collaborations at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) have excluded much of the allowed mass range and reported excesses at the 2-3 standard deviation (s.d.) level for M H \u2248 125 GeV [9,10]. The experiments now exclude 111 < M H < 122 GeV, 129 < M H < 559 GeV (ATLAS) [11], and 110 < M H < 122 GeV, 127 < M H < 600 GeV (CMS) [12]. Both experiments have observed a resonance consistent with SM Higgs production at M H \u2248 125 GeV, primarily in the \u03b3\u03b3 and ZZ final states, above the 5 s.d. level [11,12]. Demonstrating that the observed resonance is due to SM Higgs boson production requires also observing it in the bb final state, which is the dominant decay mode in this mass range.",

We estimate the MJ background from data and other backgrounds from simulation. The V +jets and tt samples are simulated with the alpgen [23] Monte Carlo (MC) generator interfaced to pythia [24] for parton showering and hadronization. alpgen samples are produced using the MLM parton-jet matching prescription [23]. The V +jets samples contain V + jj (where j = u, d, s or g) and V + cj (together denoted as \"V +light-flavor\") processes, and V + bb and V + cc (together denoted as \"V +heavy-flavor\"), generated separately from V +lightflavor. pythia is used to simulate the production of dibosons (W W , W Z, and ZZ), and all signal processes. Single top quark events are generated with the singletop event generator [25,26] using pythia for parton evolution and hadronization. Simulation of background and signal processes uses the CTEQ6L1 [27,28] leading-order (LO) parton distribution functions. Events are processed through a full D0 detector simulation based on geant [29]. To account for multiple pp interactions, all generated events are overlaid with an event from a sample of random beam crossings with the same instantaneous luminosity profile as data. Further on, events are reconstructed using the same software as is used for data.",

We observe a 1.0 s.d. excess in data over the background expectation, and our expected sensitivity is 1.8 s.d. If interpreted as a cross section measurement, the resulting scale factor with respect to the predicted SM value [31,32]  In the search for the SM Higgs boson we observe no significant excess relative to the SM expectation and proceed to set upper limits on the SM Higgs boson production cross section. We calculate all limits at the 95% C.L. using the modified frequentist CL s approach with a Poisson log-likelihood ratio of the signal+background hypothesis to the background-only hypotheses as the test statistic [46][47][48]. We treat systematic uncertainties as \"nuisance parameters\" constrained by their priors, and the best fits of these parameters are determined at each value of M H by maximizing the likelihood with respect to the data. We remove the V +jets normalization obtained from the M W T distribution and allow the components to vary by the aforementioned uncertainties of 6% and 20% on V +light-flavor and V +heavy-flavor production, respectively. Independent fits are performed to the background-only and signal-plus-background hypotheses. All correlations are maintained among channels and between signal and background. Figure 2 shows the background-subtracted data along with the best fit for the background-only model \u00b11 s.d. systematic uncertainties and the expected signal contribution for all channels combined, where we combine bins from each channel according to their log 10 (s/b) value in order to group bins with similar sensitivity. The log-likelihood ratios for the background-only model and the signalplus-background model as a function of M H are shown in Fig. 3. The upper limit on the cross section for \u03c3(pp \u2192 H + X) \u00d7 B(H \u2192 bb) for M H = 125 GeV is a factor of 5.2 larger than the SM expectation and our expected sensitivity is 4.7. The corresponding observed and expected limits relative to the SM expectation are given in Table II. In conclusion, we have performed a search for SM Higgs boson production in \u2113+ E T +jets final states using two or three jets and b-tagging with the full Run II data set of 9.7 fb \u22121 of integrated luminosity from the D0 detector. The results are in agreement with the expected event D\u00d8, 9.7 fb -1 Log-Likelihood Ratio  yield, and we set upper limits on \u03c3(pp \u2192 H + X) \u00d7 B(H \u2192 bb) relative to the SM Higgs boson cross section \u03c3 SM for M H between 100 and 150 GeV, as summarized in Table II. For M H = 125 GeV, the observed limit normalized to the SM prediction is 5.2 and the expected limit is 4.7.",

Uncertainties on the alpgen renormalization and factorization scales are evaluated by multiplying the nominal scale for each, simultaneously, by factors of 0.5 and 2.0 (2%), while uncertainties on the choice of PDFs (2%) are estimated using the prescription of Ref.
