The production of ppK + K \u2212 and a \u039b(1520) 0 (\u039b(1520) 0 ) signal in the pK \u2212 (pK + ) invariant mass spectrum are clearly observed. However, no evidence for an exotic baryon near 1540 MeV/c 2 , denoted as \u0398(1540) 0 (\u0398(1540) 0 ) or \u0398(1540) ++ (\u0398(1540) \u2212\u2212 ), is seen in the pK \u2212 (pK + ) or pK + (pK \u2212 ) invariant mass spectra. Cross sections for \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 ppK + K \u2212 , \u039b(1520) 0p K + + c.c. and the products \u03c3(\u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 \u0398(1540) 0p K + + c.c.)B(\u0398(1540) 0 \u2192 pK \u2212 ) and \u03c3(\u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 \u0398(1540) ++p K \u2212 + c.c.)B(\u0398(1540) ++ \u2192 pK + ) are measured. We also determine upper limits on the products of the \u03c7c0 and \u03c7c2 two-photon decay widths and their branching fractions to ppK + K \u2212 at the 90% credibility level. Quantum chromodynamics allows for the existence of exotic hadronic states such as glueballs, hybrids and multi-quark states with valence quark and gluon configurations that are distinct from normal quark-antiquark mesons and three-quark baryons [1]. There is a long history of searches for these types of states, but no solid examples were seen prior to the recent discovery of tetraquark and pentaquark states containing charm and beauty quarks.",

Since the valence structure of J/\u03c8p is ccuud, the newly discovered particles must consist of at least five quarks. Several theoretical interpretations of these states have been developed, such as the diquark picture [9] and hadronic molecules [10]. Actually, the first strong experimental evidence for a pentaquark state, referred to as the \u0398(1540) + , was reported in the reaction \u03b3n \u2192 nK + K \u2212 in the LEPS experiment [11]. It was a candidate for a uudds pentaquark state. However, it was not confirmed in larger-statistics data samples in the same experiment and was most probably not a genuine state [12].",

            "text": "To confirm the pentaquark states discovered by LHCb, further experimental searches for exotic baryons should be pursued. If fully confirmed, exotic baryons would be most naturally explained as pentaquark states. The possibility of observing additional hypothetical exotic baryons in \u03b3\u03b3 collisions is discussed in Ref. [13], where Fig. 3 depicts possible diagrams for the exclusive doubleand single-pentaquark productions in \u03b3\u03b3 collisions. High luminosity electron-positron colliders are well suited to measurements of the two-photon production since they provide a large flux of quasi-real photons colliding at two-photon center-of-mass (CM) energies covering a wide range. Due to the high luminosity accumulated at B factories, searches for exotic baryons in exclusive \u03b3\u03b3 reactions are possible. The authors in Ref. [13] suggest that single pentaquark production may be viewed as a collision of a non-resonant di-baryon and a di-meson pair. One of the incoming photons fluctuates into two mesons with strangeness; one meson then collides with the hadronic system produced by the other incoming photon. The cross section for the reaction \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 ppK + K \u2212 is predicted to be around 0.1 nb for W \u03b3\u03b3 \u2265 2(m p +m K ) [13], where W \u03b3\u03b3 is the CM energy of two-photon system that is the same as the invariant mass of the final-state hadron system and m p and m K are the proton and kaon nominal masses [14]. This presents the opportunity to search for novel exotic baryons, denoted as \u0398(1540) 0 \u2192 pK \u2212 and \u0398(1540) ++ \u2192 pK + which are similar to \u0398(1540) + , in intermediate processes in two-photon annihilations.",

We obtain the number of ppK + K \u2212 events in each ppK + K \u2212 invariant mass bin (n fit ) by fitting the | P * t | distribution between zero and 1.0 GeV/c. The signal shape is obtained from MC simulation in the corresponding mass bin and the background shape is parameterized as a first-order Chebyshev polynomial. The background shape is fixed to that from the overall fit due to the small statistics in each mass bin. The resulting ppK + K \u2212 invariant mass distribution is shown in Fig. 2(a).",

Figure 4 shows the pK \u2212 and pK + invariant mass distributions, where for the M (pK + ) distribution the pK \u2212 mass is required to be outside \u039b(1520) 0 signal region between 1.49 and 1.55 GeV/c 2 . To extract the signal and background yields in the | P * t | signal region and the corresponding sideband region, defined as 0.6 GeV/c < | P * t | < 1.0 GeV/c, unbinned maximum likelihood fits to the pK \u2212 invariant mass distributions are performed simultaneously. The shapes of the \u039b(1520) 0 and \u0398(1540) 0 signals with mass resolutions of 6.5 MeV/c 2 are obtained from MC simulations with energy-dependent widths and phase space factors included. In the fit, a second-order Chebyshev polynomial is used for the backgrounds in addition to the normalized | P * t | sideband contribution. Similar fits with a \u0398(1540) ++ signal are performed to the pK + invariant mass distributions. Figure 4(a) shows the fitted results to the M (pK \u2212 ) distribution with the \u039b(1520) 0 and \u0398(1540) 0 signal shapes included, while Fig. 4(b) shows the fitted results to the M (pK + ) distribution with the \u0398(1540) ++ signal shape included only. From the fits, the numbers of \u039b(1520) 0 , \u0398(1540) 0 and \u0398(1540) ++ signal events are 288\u00b148, 22\u00b134 and \u221216\u00b134, respectively. The statistical significances of the \u039b(1520) 0 and \u0398(1540) 0 are estimated to be 8.6\u03c3 and 1.4\u03c3, respectively, by calculating \u22122 ln(L 0 /L max ), where L 0 and L max are the likelihoods of the fits without and with the signal component, respectively. We obtain the yields of \u039b(1520) 0p K + and \u0398(1540) 0p K + in each ppK + K \u2212 invariant mass bin by performing similar simultaneous fits to M (pK \u2212 ) distribution as was done above for the entire ppK + K \u2212 mass region. The resulting \u039b(1520) 0p K + and \u0398(1540) 0p K + invariant mass distributions are shown in Figs. 5(a) and (b). The corresponding \u03c3(\u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 \u039b(1520) 0p K + ) and \u03c3(\u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 \u0398(1540) 0p K + )B(\u0398(1540) 0 \u2192 pK \u2212 ) measurements are shown in Figs. 6(a) and (b), where the error bars are statistical only.

There are no evident structures. The sum of the \u03c6p and \u03c6p invariant mass distributions is shown in Fig. 8(c). No significant evidence of an ss partner of the pentaquark states P c (4380) and P c (4450) [8] is observed. Systematic error sources and their contributions to the cross section measurements are summarized in Table I. The particle identification uncertainties are 1.4% for each kaon and 2.4% (2.0%) for each proton (anti-proton). A momentum-weighted systematic error in tracking efficiency of about 0.4% is taken for each track. The statistical error in the MC samples is about 0.5%. The accuracy of the two-photon luminosity function calcu- lated with the treps generator is estimated to be about 5%, including the error from neglecting radiative corrections (2%), the uncertainty from the form factor effect (2%) [17], and the uncertainty in the total integrated luminosity (1.4%). The trigger efficiency for four-chargedtrack events is rather high because of the redundancy of the Belle first-level multi-track trigger. According to the MC simulation, the signal trigger efficiency increases with the ppK + K \u2212 mass. The uncertainty of the trigger simulation is less than 4% [23]. The preselection efficiency for the final states has little dependence on the ppK + K \u2212 invariant mass, with an uncertainty smaller than 2.5%. From Ref. [14], the uncertainty in the world average value for B(\u039b(1520) 0 \u2192 pK \u2212 ) is 2.3%. The uncertainty in the fitted yield for the signal is estimated by varying the background shape and fit range, which is 8.1% for ppK + K \u2212 , 9.8% for \u039b(1520) 0p K + , 40% for \u0398(1540) 0p K + , and 21% for \u0398(1540) ++p K \u2212 . For the \u039b(1520) 0p K + , \u0398(1540) 0p K + , and \u0398(1540) ++p K \u2212 modes, we estimate the systematic errors associated with the \u039b(1520) 0 and \u0398(1540) resonance parameters by changing the values of the masses and widths of the res- onances by \u00b11\u03c3. The resulting differences of 5.7%, 7.4% and 5.5% in the fitted results are taken as systematic errors. The uncertainty on the mass resolution is estimated by changing the MC signal resolution by \u00b110%, which is 1.1% for \u039b(1520) 0p K + , 2.5% for \u0398(1540) 0p K + , and 4.0% for \u0398(1540) ++p K \u2212 . Assuming that all of these systematic error sources are independent, we add them in quadrature to obtain the total systematic errors of 13%, 16%, 42% and 25% for ppK + K \u2212 , \u039b(1520) 0p K + , \u0398(1540) 0p K + , and \u0398(1540) ++p K \u2212 , respectively.",

            "text": "For a ppK + K \u2212 invariant mass above 3.1 GeV/c 2 , we measure the production rate of charmonium states. In measuring the production rates, | P * t | is required to be less than 0.17 GeV/c in order to reduce backgrounds from non-two-photon processes and two-photon processes with extra particles other than the signal final state. Figure 9 shows the ppK + K \u2212 invariant mass distribution. No clear \u03c7 c0 or \u03c7 c2 signals are seen. The mass spectrum is fitted with two incoherent Breit-Wigner functions convolved with a corresponding Gaussian resolution function as the \u03c7 c0 and \u03c7 c2 signal shapes, and a second-order Chebyshev polynomial as the background shape. The fit result is shown in Fig. 9 as a solid curve, where the dashed line is the fitted background and the shaded histogram is the normalized | P * t | sideband contribution. The statistical signal significances are 0.2\u03c3 and 0.8\u03c3 for the \u03c7 c0 and \u03c7 c2 , respectively. Since no significant signals are observed, the 90% C.L. upper limits on the \u03c7 c0 and \u03c7 c2 yields are determined to be 16.4 and 18.0, respectively. In these calculations, we assume there is no interference between the charmonium and the continuum amplitudes. A systematic error estimate similar to that for the cross sections results in total systematic errors of 29% and 13% for \u0393 \u03b3\u03b3 (R)B(R \u2192 ppK + K \u2212 ) for R = \u03c7 c0 and \u03c7 c2 , respectively.",

The factor K is calculated from the two-photon luminosity function L \u03b3\u03b3 (M R ) for a resonance with mass M R using the relation K = 4\u03c0 2 L \u03b3\u03b3 (M R )/M 2 R , which is valid when the resonance width is small compared to its mass. The K factor is calculated to be 1.15 fb/eV and 0.95 fb/eV for the \u03c7 c0 and \u03c7 c2 , respectively, using treps [17]. The efficiencies are 2.77% and 3.97% for the \u03c7 c0 and \u03c7 c2 , respectively.
