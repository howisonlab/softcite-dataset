Searches for muon neutrino disappearance at the IceCube neutrino telescope presently provide the strongest limits in the space of mixing angles for eVscale sterile neutrinos.

Of these, IceCube probes the highest energy range, with a highstatistics sample of well-reconstructed atmospheric neutrinos spanning the range 6 GeV to 20 TeV. This is a regime where matter effects are not only non-negligible, but can be very large. For a 1 eV 2 sterile neutrino, for example, a large matter-induced resonance would be expected at 3 TeV, greatly amplifying the ordinarily small oscillation probability [15][16][17][18][19]. An example oscillation spectrum calculated by the NuSQUIDS software package [20] is shown in Fig 1. IceCube has performed searches for sterile neutrinos in both high-energy [11] and lowenergy [12] data samples. No evidence for anomalous muon neutrino disappearance was observed in either case. These null observations, along with disappearance constraints from other experiments, have introduced a severe tension into sterile neutrino models. The viable parameter space for a simple sterile neutrino explanation of short baseline and \u03bd e disappearance anomalies is now small according to some commentators [21] and vanishing according to others [22]. This has prompted consideration of more exotic scenarios to explain the anomalies, which may [23][24][25][26] or may not [27][28][29][30][31] include sterile neutrinos. A new highenergy sterile neutrino analysis from IceCube using seven years of data and commensurately improved control of systematic uncertainties is now in preparation. This analysis will probe the region of small mixing angles to further constrain the parameter space of sterile neutrino models.",

A continuous parameterizartion of refrozen hole ice scattering has been incorporated, deriving from advances in understanding its properties from lower energy analyses. An advanced treatment of the atmospheric flux parameters has been implemented using the \"Barr scheme\" [39], applying 6 effective parameters that capture the uncertainty in hadronic modelling of the air shower, constrained by collider data. This replaces the effective \u03c0/K and \u03bd/\u03bd parameters with a more physically motivated and complete uncertainty parameterization.
