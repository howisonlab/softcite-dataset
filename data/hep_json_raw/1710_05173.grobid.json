For many \u03b7 \u2032 decay channels the low background data samples are up to three orders of magnitude larger than collected in any previous experiment. Here we review the most significant results on \u03b7 and \u03b7 \u2032 obtained at BESIII so far. The analyses range from detailed studies of the common decays dynamics, observations of new radiative and Dalitz decays, and search for rare/forbidden decays with sensitivity up to B \u223c 10 \u22125 . Finally, prospects of the forthcoming runs at J/\u03c8 peak for the \u03b7 and \u03b7 \u2032 physics are discussed.",

            "text": "More than half a century after \u03b7 [1] and \u03b7 \u2032 [2,3] discoveries, the mesons still attract attention of both theory and experiment. As the neutral members of the ground state pseudoscalar nonet, they play an important role in understanding low energy Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). The main properties of \u03b7 and \u03b7 \u2032 mesons are firmly established and their main decay modes are fairly well known. Decays of the \u03b7/\u03b7 \u2032 probe a wide variety of physics issues e.g. \u03c0 0 \u2212\u03b7 mixing, light quark masses and pion-pion scattering. In particular the \u03b7 \u2032 meson, much heavier than the Goldstone bosons of broken chiral symmetry, plays a special role as predominantly the singlet state arising from the strong axial U (1) anomaly. In addition the decays of both mesons are used to search for processes beyond any considered extension of the Standard Model (SM) and to test fundamental discrete symmetries.",

            "text": "The main decays of the \u03b7/\u03b7 \u2032 meson are hadronic and radiative processes. Alternatively one can divide the decays into two following classes. The first class consists of hadronic decays into three pseudoscalar mesons, such as \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03b7\u03c0\u03c0. Those processes are already included in the lowest order, O(p 2 ), of chiral perturbation theory (ChPT) [4]. The second class includes anomalous processes involving odd number of pseudoscalar mesons, such as \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c1 0 \u03b3 and \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 . They are driven by the Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) term [5,6] which enters at O(p 4 ) order [7]. Dynamics of \u03b7 decays remains a subject of extensive studies aiming at precision tests of ChPT in SU L (3) \u00d7 SU R (3) sector (i.e. involving s quark). Model-dependent approaches for describing low energy meson interactions, such as Vector Meson Dominance (VMD) [8,9], and the large number of colors, N C , extensions of ChPT [10] together with dispersive methods could be extensively tested in \u03b7 \u2032 decays.

Since its commissioning in 2008, a series of important results have been achieved, including charmonium decays, light hadron spectroscopy and charm meson decay, with the world's largest data samples in the \u03c4 -charm region. Due to high production rate of light mesons in the charmonium, e.g., J/\u03c8, decays, the BESIII experiment also offers a unique possibility to investigate the light meson decays. Radiative decays J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b7\u03b3 and J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b7 \u2032 \u03b3 provide clean and efficient sources of \u03b7/\u03b7 \u2032 mesons for the decay studies. The accompanying radiative photon, with energy of 1.5 GeV/c 2 and 1.4 GeV/c 2 respectively, is well separated from the decay products. An alternative source of the \u03b7 (\u03b7 \u2032 ) is the hadronic two-body process of J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c6\u03b7 (J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c6\u03b7 \u2032 ) where \u03c6 is identified via \u03c6 \u2192 K + K \u2212 decay could be used to tag \u03b7(\u03b7 \u2032 ) decays where not all decay products are reconstructed.",

However, it turns out the electromagnetic contribution is strongly suppressed [21][22][23][24]. Therefore the decays provide a unique opportunity for a precision determination of m u /m d quark mass ratio in a strong process [25]. The challenge for the theory is to provide a model independent description of the process based on ChPT, supplemented by general analytic properties of the amplitudes (dispersive methods). This approach keeps the promise to finally resolve long standing discrepancy between the lowest order ChPT prediction for the decay width of \u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 of 66 eV [26] and the experimental value of 300\u00b111 eV [17]. This would conclude several years of efforts put by several theory groups to understand the problem, see e.g. [27][28][29][30][31][32][33][34][35]. However, now there is a need for high statistics Dalitz plot distributions of \u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 to test and/or constrain the theory predictions.",

In the VMD model the main contribution to the decay comes from \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03b3\u03c1 0 [66]. In the past the di-pion mass distribution was studied by several experiments e.g. JADE [67], CELLO [68], PLUTO [69], TASSO [70], TPC/\u03b3\u03b3 [71], and ARGUS [72]. A peak shift of about +20 MeV with respect to the expected position from the \u03c1 0 contribution was consistently observed. Dedicated [73] analysis using \u223c2000 \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03b3\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 events concluded that \u03c1 0 contribution is not sufficient to describe the di-pion mass spectrum. This discrepancy could be attributed to the WZW box anomaly contribution which should be included as an extra non resonant term in the decay amplitude. It was suggested that the fits to the shape of the di-pion distribution will allow to determine the ratio of the two contributions [74]. The evidence for the box anomaly with a significance of 4\u03c3 was reported in 1997 by the Crystal Barrel experiment [75] using a sample of 7490\u00b1180 \u03b7 \u2032 events but this observation was not confirmed by the subsequent measurement by the L3 Collaboration [76] using 2123\u00b153 events. Recently proposed model-independent approach, based on ChPT and a dispersion theory, describes the \u03b7/\u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b3 decay amplitudes as a product of an universal and a reaction specific part [77]. The uni-   versal part could be extracted from the pion vector form factor measured precisely in e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 . The reaction specific part was determined experimentally for the \u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b3 decay by WASA-at-COSY [78] and KLOE [79]. It was shown the di-pion distribution for the \u03b7 decay can not be described by the pion vector form factor only. In Ref. [80] it was hypothesized that the reaction specific part could be similar for the \u03b7 and \u03b7 \u2032 decays.",

The decay is directly related to \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b3 and involves virtual photon, \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b3 * \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 e + e \u2212 . The conversion process provides a more stringent test of the models. Predictions for the decay are given within VMD model and unitarized ChPT [85][86][87]. In the e + e \u2212 invariant mass (q \u2261 M (e + e \u2212 )) distribution for a conversion decay the contribution of the photon propagator translates to the pole-like 1/q dependence close to the lower kinematic boundary of q = 2m e (see also Sec. 3.3). For the \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 e + e \u2212 decay a dominant \u03c1 0 contribution in the M (\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) is also expected. The CLEO measurement based on just 7.9 +3.9 \u22122.7 signal events was unable to explore these distributions. However, the measured branching fraction B(\u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 e + e \u2212 ) = (2.5 +1.2 \u22120.9 \u00b10.5)\u00d710 \u22123 [63], is consistent with the predicted value of \u223c 2\u00d710 \u22123 . The corresponding conversion decay with a \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 pair are suppressed by two orders of magnitude due to q = 2m \u00b5 cutoff. In the CLEO analysis an upper limit of B(\u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) < 2.4 \u00d7 10 \u22124 , at 90% C.L. was set.",

Figure 11 displays the e + e \u2212 mass spectrum by requiring |M (\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 e + e \u2212 ) \u2212 m \u03b7 \u2032 | < 0.02 GeV/c 2 , where the background from \u03b3\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 following the photon conversion in the detector material could be clearly seen. The peak close to 2m e corresponds to the \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 e + e \u2212 signal and the second peak around 0.015 GeV/c 2 comes from the \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03b3\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 background. For the selected data sample any other background is negligible and the efficiency for the signal is 16.9%. The number of 429 \u00b1 24 signal events is taken from a fit of the two contributions to the M (e + e \u2212 ) distribution. The corresponding branching fraction of B(\u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 e + e \u2212 ) = (2.11\u00b10.12\u00b10.15)\u00d710 \u22123 is in good agreement with theoretical predictions and with the CLEO result. The mass spectra of \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and e + e \u2212 are consistent with the expected \u03c1 0 domination in M (\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) distribution and the peak in the M (e + e \u2212 ) distribution just above 2m e threshold with a long tail.

The remaining events in the \u03b7 \u2032 mass region are consistent with the contributions from the background estimated with MC simulations. The upper limit of B(\u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) < 2.9 \u00d7 10 \u22125 at the 90% C.L. is set. 3.3 \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03b3e + e \u2212 [12] Dalitz decays of light pseudoscalar mesons, P \u2192 \u03b3e + e \u2212 where P = \u03c0 0 , \u03b7, \u03b7 \u2032 , play an important role in revealing structure of the hadrons and the interaction mechanism between photons and the hadrons [9]. The decay rates can be calculated in Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) where the inner structure of the mesons is encoded by the transition form factor (TFF), F (q 2 ), where q 2 is the invariant mass of the lepton pair squared.

The theoretical uncertainty on the SM calculation of a \u00b5 is dominated by hadronic corrections and therefore limited by the accuracy of their de-termination [89]. In particular, the hadronic light-bylight (HLbL) scattering contribution to a \u00b5 includes two meson-photon-photon vertices that can be related to the TFF.

In the BESIII experiment the largest background comes from QED processes and J/\u03c8 \u2192 e + e \u2212 \u03b3\u03b3 decays. For these channels, the combination of the e + e \u2212 with any final-state photon produces a smooth M (\u03b3e + e \u2212 ) distribution. The primary peaking background comes from the decay \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 followed by a \u03b3 conversion in the material in front of the main drift chamber. The distance from the reconstructed vertex point of the electron-positron pair to the z axis is used to reduce the background down to 42.7 \u00b1 8.0 events. The resulting M (\u03b3e + e \u2212 ) distribution after the selection criteria is shown in Fig. 13(a) and exhibits a clear peak at the \u03b7 \u2032 mass. A fit is performed to determine the signal yield with the signal shape represented by the MC. The non-peaking background is described by a first-order Chebychev polynomial. The fraction of the peaking background is fixed from the simulation. The signal yield and the detection efficiency is summarized in Table 2. The decay \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 from the same data set is used for normalization and the result is quoted in terms of the ratio \u0393(\u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03b3e + e \u2212 )/\u0393(\u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3) = (2.13 \u00b1 0.09 \u00b1 0.07) \u00d7 10 \u22122 . Using the branching fraction of \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 in PDG [17], we obtain the first measurement of the \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03b3e + e \u2212 branching fraction reported in Table 2.",

For \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 e + e \u2212 \u03c9 decay, candidate events with four well-reconstructed charged tracks and at least three photons are selected. The external conversion background from \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03b3\u03c9 is removed by requiring the distance of the vertex from the z axis to be less than 2 cm (according to simulation only 2.6\u00b10.3 background events will survive the cut). In the selected data sample both the \u03c9 peak in M (\u03c0 0 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) and the \u03b7 \u2032 peak in M (\u03c0 0 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 e + e \u2212 ) is clearly seen in the scatter plot shown in Fig. 14(a). The best identification of the process is achieved in the M (\u03c0 0 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 e + e \u2212 )\u2212M (\u03c0 0 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) distribution. This distribution is used in a fit to extract the signal yields as indicated in Fig. 14(b). The decay of \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c9e + e \u2212 is observed with a statistical significance of 8\u03c3, and its branching fraction is measured to be B(\u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c9e + e \u2212 ) = (1.97\u00b10.34\u00b10.17)\u00d710 \u22124 , consistent with theoretical predictions [85,96]. 3.5 \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3\u03c0 0 [14] The \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3\u03c0 0 decay should be dominated by the sequential process \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03b3\u03c9 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3\u03c0 0 . The interesting question is to determine a non-resonant contribution to the decay. At present there is only a preliminary theoretical analysis which uses combination of the linear sigma model and VMD. The prediction for branching fraction of \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3\u03c0 0 is \u223c 6 \u00d7 10 \u22123 [97,98]. This is quite puzzling result giving two times larger value than the \u03b3\u03c9 sequence. The first observation of \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3\u03c0 0 is reported by the BESIII experiment. Fig. 15(a) shows the \u03b3\u03b3\u03c0 0 invariant mass spectrum, where the clear \u03b7 \u2032 peak is observed. By assuming that the inclusive decay \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3\u03c0 0 can be attributed to the vector mesons \u03c1 0 and \u03c9 and the non-resonant contribution, a unbinned maximum likelihood fit to the \u03b3\u03c0 0 invariant mass [ Fig. 15 (b)] is performed to determine the signal yields for the nonresonant \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3\u03c0 0 decay using the \u03b7 \u2032 signal events with |M (\u03b3\u03b3\u03c0 0 )\u2212m \u03b7 \u2032 | < 25 MeV/c 2 . In the fit, the \u03c1 0 -\u03c9 interference is considered, but possible interference between the \u03c9 (\u03c1 0 ) and the non-resonant process is neglected.",

Based on the world largest sample of J/\u03c8 events, the recent results on \u03b7/\u03b7 \u2032 decays achieved at the BESIII experiment are presented. In addition to the improved accuracy on the branching fractions of \u03b7 \u2032 , observation of \u03b7 \u2032 new decay modes, including \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 , \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c1 \u2213 \u03c0 \u00b1 and \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03b3e + e \u2212 , were reported for the first time.

In particular a competitive extraction of \u03c9 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 branching fraction is possible. It is found that an extra contribution is necessary to describe data besides the contributions from \u03c1 0 (770) and \u03c9.",
