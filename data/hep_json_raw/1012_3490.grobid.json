The previous meetings were held in 2006 here at IHEP (Beijing), in 2007 at Cornell University (Ithaca, NY); and in 2009 in Leimen, Germany. Over 30 presentations of experimental results were presented here before the future facilities talks. Clearly, there is not enough time even to summarize all that we have seen from experiments, to recognize all the memorable plots and results -tempting as it is to reproduce the many clean signals and data vs theory figures, the quantum correlations plots, and the D-mixing plots before and after the latest CLEO-c data is added. So, this review will give only my personal observations, exposing my prejudices and my areas of ignorance, no doubt. This overview will be at a fairly high level of abstraction -not re-showing individual plots or results. I ask the forgiveness of those who will have been slighted in this way -meaning all the presenters.",

Given its size, mixing in the D 0 system could be due to new physics. If so, observation of CP violation in this mixing would be a demonstration that the observed large mixing is due to physics beyond the standard model. Before, standard-model mixing in charm was thought to be too small to be interesting. However, this small background from standard-model effects was coming to be seen as a plus before large mixing was observed (relative to B mesons where the standardmodel mixing is now seen as an annoying background to any signal for new physics).",

Think of: A surprising number of new results, even among the most interesting new results, have systematic errors which are significantly smaller than the statistical errorseven from the full CLEO-c, BaBar, or Belle data sets. So, the case for new facilities is very strong on that basis. There is room and utility for much more data. More data (and more analyses of existing data) are also needed to help reinforce or remove states from the growing list that need to be explained, and to see additional decay modes of states already indicated -even those multiply confirmed. We have all been uncomfortable with the idea that QCD would only choose to make states of quark-antiquark pairs and three quarks of different color. Yet, we seem to be forced against our will to accept other states that we have every reason to believe must exist. On the other hand, it is unlikely that every newlyobserved state will survive an onslaught of new data. Possible states near thresholds need to be tested against other explanations: e.g., the possibility of fluctuations in threshold-enhancement-shaped backgrounds and/or fluctuations of backgrounds otherwise incompletely modeled as phase-space shaped.",

Just how far will we be able to push mixing and CP -violation measurements before we hit a wall of systematic uncertainty? Of course, we will need to experience the additional real data to be certain about this. However, knowing the likely-most-productive modes and avenues to pursue first is always useful.

It was proposed as an explanation of the historic theory underestimate of the observed production of charmonium and open charm. The model has detailed predictions for polarization of charmonium, predictions which have not been born out by data. To be viable, it also should have had a universality that has not been seen in charm production at HERA and the Tevatron. I have always been uncomfortable with the appearance of an easy acceptance of any suggested correction to theory that increased cross-section predictions. Which enhancements of the simplest calculations will survive? What will provide universality in matrix elements, and correctly describe onium polarization as a function of p t ? Are next-to-leading-order (NLO) and relativistic corrections enough to explain earlier cross-section discrepancies? To flip the size and sign of charmonium polarization? Joan Soto stated that \"Important discrepancies with experiment have been resolved\"; 1 for example, the factor of two in the NLO prediction with respect to the leading-order. However, will the next-to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO) contribuion really be negligible on this scale? Theory errors, even before estimating NNLO, etc. remain too large to have confidence yet. Of course, we also want to see resolution of the experimental situation in polarization measurements within CDF (current and earlier) and with DZero.",

However, is there any real progress in understanding? Questions in spectroscopy are multiplying still, though some patterns may be appearing. At the same time, charm is providing input to help understand light-meson spectroscopy. A personal favorite of mine is the use of charm decay as a source of information on low mass (e.g., scalar) mesons. Also, charm decays provide clean laboratories for the spectroscopy of excited kaon states. Many of the new states still require confirmation or more precise mass and width measurements. As more data become available from LHCb and from a future Super-B factory, analyses similar to the ones presented here can further elucidate light-meson spectroscopy.",
