We present here comparisons to leading order and next-to-leading order predictions. DOI Final states containing a vector boson V (V W, Z) and multiple jets [V jets] are a key signal channel for important standard model (SM) processes such as t t or single top production, as well as a search channel for the Higgs boson and for physics beyond the SM. The production of V jets via quantum chromodynamics (QCD) presents a very large background to these processes. The ability to describe it accurately is therefore crucial, as well as being a stringent test of the power of perturbative QCD predictions. Consequently, a precise measurement of the cross section for QCD V jets production is an important component of the hadron collider experimental program. In this paper, we report a measurement [1] of the differential cross sections for direct W ! e n-jet production as a function of the transverse energy E jet T [2] of the nth-leading jet (the highest E T jet for W 1-jet, the second highest E T jet for W 2-jet, etc.), for n 1 \u00ff 4 and E jet T > 20 GeV. We also provide the total cross section n W ! e n-jet; E nth-jet T > 25 GeV for n 1 \u00ff 4. In order to minimize the dependence of the measurement on the modeling of the W boson production and decay kinematics, we quote cross sections defined within a limited W decay phase space: E ele T > 20 GeV, j ele j < 1:1, E T > 30 GeV, and",

As such, they provide a benchmark which can be directly used for background estimates and for the validation and tuning of QCD phenomenological models. At the end of this paper we present, as examples, comparisons of our results with some of the available predictions. It is important to note that the cross section is not corrected for effects resulting from the interaction between the proton and antiproton remnants (the ''underlying event''). Such a correction would introduce into the measurement a dependence on theoretical models of the underlying event.",

            "text": "The processes which contribute background events to our W candidate sample can be divided into two categories: ''leptonic'' and ''multijet.'' The leptonic background contains real electrons and/or neutrinos from boson decay and includes W ! , Z ! e e \u00ff , WW, W, and top pair production. The multijet background arises from QCD interaction events in which one or more jets are incorrectly reconstructed in the detector as electrons and have mismeasured energy, resulting in large event E 6 T . Background estimation proceeds as follows. For each W n-jet sample, a background-enriched event sample is constructed by removing the E 6 T > 30 GeV requirement in the W selection. Multijet, leptonic, and signal E 6 T histograms are then fit to the data in the range [0, 100] GeV. The measured E 6 T spectrum, and the result of the fit, are shown in Fig. 1 for the W 1-jet sample. For this fit the leptonic background and signal processes are modeled by applying the W event selection minus the E 6 T > 30 GeV requirement to detector simulated Monte Carlo event samples of these processes. The multijet background is modeled using an event sample selected from the same 320 pb \u00ff1 analysis dataset by requiring that at least two of the electron identification criteria fail. Kinematic cuts are unchanged, resulting in a background-dominated sample that accurately reflects the kinematic distributions of the multijet background events in the signal sample. It is necessary to correct this multijet sample for 5% contamination from signal and leptonic background events, esti-mated by applying the multijet selection criteria to the Monte Carlo simulations of these processes. In the fit, only the normalizations of the multijet and signal E 6 T histograms are allowed to float. The normalization of the W ! and Z ! e e \u00ff histograms relative to the signal is fixed by the well-established relationships between these cross sections [11]. The normalizations of the WW, W, and top pair production histograms are determined using the recently measured cross sections for these processes [12]. Once the fit is performed, the background fractions in each W n-jet sample are obtained by integrating the respective histograms, with their fitted normalization, above the E 6 T cut of 30 GeV. These fractions are then used to normalize the jet E T distributions of each background model relative to the candidates to give the background correction as a function of E jet T . This method offers a more accurate description of the kinematics of the multijet background when compared with previous approaches [3]. Figure 1 demonstrates a successful modeling of the E 6 T spectrum. Similarly good agreement was found in the electron E T and m W T distributions across all jet multiplicities.",

To account for this effect, corrections to the measured cross sections are computed by multiplying the number of overlapping p p interactions, estimated using the primary vertex multiplicity in the signal sample, with the rate of jet production in ''minimum-bias'' events selected independently of activity in the central detector. The corrections are less than 2% in the lowest E jet T bins and decrease rapidly with increasing E jet T . The total background fraction increases with increasing jet multiplicity and transverse energy. At low E jet T it is 10% (40%) in the 1-jet (4-jet) sample, rising to 90% at the highest E jet T for all jet multiplicities. Multijet events contribute 70% of the overall background in the 1-jet sample.

Samples for each jet multiplicity n were obtained using the ALPGEN v1.3 [13]  hadronization. PYTHIA includes an underlying event model, hereafter referred to as TUNE A, which has been tuned to describe Tevatron data [15]. The efficiency correction factor is defined as the ratio of two subsets of the generated signal events: in the numerator, the number of reconstructed events which pass the W ! e selection criteria, and in the denominator, the number of generator-level events which pass the electron, neutrino and transversemass cuts corresponding to our cross section definition. This is found to be 60 3%, independent of event jet multiplicity and kinematics within the quoted uncertainty. By comparing Z ! e e \u00ff measured and simulated event samples, we confirm that electron identification efficiencies are well reproduced by our Monte Carlo across all measured phase space to within 5%. This uncertainty also covers the observed variation in efficiency obtained by changing the number of final state partons in the ALPGEN matrix element (ME) calculation and the parton showering program from PYTHIA to HERWIG v6.5 [16]. Additionally, the W candidate event yield must be corrected to account for the efficiency of the online trigger to accept high E T electrons. This is independent of jet kinematics and found to be 96:2 0:6% [7]. A further correction to the event yield is required to form particle level W ! e n-jet cross sections as a function of E jet T . This correction factor accounts for the effect of calorimeter jet energy resolution on the measured cross section and is determined as follows. Using the ALPGEN-PYTHIA simulated signal samples, two cross sections in each E jet T bin are determined: one defined by clustering generator-level particles into jets, the other by clustering after detector reconstruction, using the same calorimeter level jet definition (including JES correction) as the one used in the data. The correction factor for each bin is then defined as the ratio of the particle to calorimeter level cross section in that bin. To avoid dependence of such a correction on the assumed particle level E jet T distribution, an iterative procedure is used to reweight the events at the particle level until the particle level E jet T distribution agrees with the corresponding data-unfolded distribution to within the systematic uncertainties of the measurement. The correction factors vary between 0.95 and 1.2 over the measured range of E jet T . The total systematic uncertainty on the cross section introduced by the jet energy measurement ranges between 5% and 20%, increasing with increasing E jet T . This is dominated by the approximately 3% [10] uncertainty on the JES correction. The effect of this uncertainty on the cross section is estimated by applying this variation to an ALPGEN-PYTHIA simulated signal sample reweighted to match the data. The sensitivity of the measurement to jet energy resolution uncertainties, estimated by varying the calorimeter resolution in the simulation, is much smaller by comparison.",

Leading order (LO) perturbative QCD calculations exist for the matrix element of V n partons, with n 6. They are included in Monte Carlo event generators [13,17,18] where the initial and final state partons are evolved through a perturbative parton shower (PS) and eventually hadronized. Additionally, the generator may include a model of the underlying event. In this LO plus PS approach, ambiguities may arise as a result of the hard emission of gluon radiation during the parton shower evolution. For example, a V n-parton event may be reconstructed, after the shower, with a jet multiplicity n j \u00de n, and the question naturally arises as to whether the event should or should not be counted in the estimate of the n j -jet cross section. This problem has been studied extensively in the literature, leading to the development of three merging algorithms, usually known as CKKW [19], Lonnblad's [20], and MLM [21]. A merging algorithm ensures that a given configuration in the multijet phase space enters into the calculation once and only once.",

The former uses MADGRAPH v4 [17] for the ME generation, PYTHIA v6.3 for the PS, and CTEQ6L1 [24] parton distribution functions (PDFs), the latter uses ALPGEN v2.12, HERWIG v6.5, and CTEQ5L [25] PDFs, respectively. Following generation, the SMPR and MLM predictions are formed by clustering the final state particles into jets using the JETCLU algorithm. The uncertainties on these predictions cover variation of the renormalization scale by a factor 0.5-2. This dominates the overall uncertainty in the absolute rates [23].",

Jets are reconstructed with a cone algorithm R 0:4, such that two partons are merged if they are within 1:3 R of each other and within R of the resulting jet centroid [27]. This is still considered to be sufficient to give a reasonable description of the perturbative structure of the jet [28]. However, before comparing with data, the nonperturbative effects of hadronization and the underlying event have to be considered. We have estimated, using PYTHIA TUNE A, the impact of these two effects. The effect of the underlying event is to increase the cross section with respect to the parton level, while the effect of hadronization is to decrease it. The magnitude of both effects decreases asymptotically with increasing E jet T . Below 50 GeV the hadronization effect dominates, leading to an overall decrease of the cross section with respect to the parton level that is within 10%. At higher E jet T , the correction is driven by the underlying event leading to an increase of at most 5%. A detailed study of this correction is outside the scope of this paper, and we do not apply any such corrections to the MCFM predictions.",
