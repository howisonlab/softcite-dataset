The large values of the c and b quark masses allow using the perturbative QCD (pQCD) calculations for describing the heavy quark production. However, to describe completely the heavy quark transition into a given hadron, a non-perturbative parametrisation tuned to experimental results is needed. Fragmentation functions, used to parametrise a transfer of quark's energy to a given hadron, are expected to be rather different for different pQCD calculations [1][2][3]. Fragmentation fractions are probabilities for c/b quark to hadronise as a particular charmed/bottom hadron, f (c \u2192 H c )/ f (b \u2192 H b ). The fragmentation fractions of b quark to a particular charmed hadron, f (b \u2192 H c ), can be defined similarly representing convolutions of the f (b \u2192 H b ) fractions and branching fractions of the bottom hadrons into a given charmed hadron. For heavy quark (Q) production at large energies far from the QQ threshold, the fragmentation fractions are often assumed to be universal.",
