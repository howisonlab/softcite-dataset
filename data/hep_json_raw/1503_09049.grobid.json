The search is performed using events that contain an electron or a muon, a hadronically decaying \u03c4 lepton, and two or more jets. The observations are found to be consistent with the standard model predictions. Assuming that all leptoquarks decay to a top quark and a \u03c4 lepton, the existence of pair produced, charge \u22121/3, third-generation leptoquarks up to a mass of 685 GeV is excluded at 95% confidence level. This result constitutes the first direct limit for leptoquarks decaying into a top quark and a \u03c4 lepton, and may also be applied directly to the pair production of bottom squarks decaying predominantly via the R-parity violating coupling \u03bb 333 .",

They appear in theories beyond the standard model (SM), such as grand unification [1][2][3], technicolor [4], and compositeness [5,6] models. A minimal extension of the SM to include all renormalizable gauge invariant interactions, while respecting existing bounds from low-energy and precision measurements leads to the effective Buchm\u00fcller-R\u00fcckl-Wyler model [7]. In this model, LQs are assumed to couple to one generation of chiral fermions, and to separately conserve L and B quantum numbers. An LQ can be either a scalar (spin 0) or a vector (spin 1) particle with a fractional electric charge. A comprehensive list of other possible quantum number assignments for LQs coupling to SM fermions can be found in ref. [8].",

There is also a lepton mediated t(u)-channel contribution that depends on the unknown lepton-quark-LQ Yukawa coupling, but this contribution is suppressed at the LHC for the production of third-generation LQs as it requires third-generation quarks in the initial state. Hence, the LQ pair production cross section depends only upon the assumed values of the LQ spin and mass, and upon the proton-proton center-of-mass energy. We consider scalar LQs in the mass range up to several hundred GeV. The corresponding next-to-leading-order (NLO) pair production cross sections and associated uncertainties at \u221a s = 8 TeV are taken from the calculation presented in ref. [19].",

In LQ 3 LQ 3 decays, \u03c4 leptons arise directly from LQ decays, as well as from W bosons in the top quark decay chain, whereas electrons and muons are produced only in leptonic decays of W bosons or \u03c4 leptons. The major backgrounds come from tt+jets, Drell-Yan(DY)+jets, and W+jets production, where a significant number of events have jets misidentified as hadronically decaying \u03c4 leptons. The search is conducted in two orthogonal selections, labelled as category A and category B. In category A, a same-sign \u00b5\u03c4 h pair is required in each event, which suppresses SM backgrounds. Misidentified \u03c4 h candidates originating from jets constitute the main background in category A. Category B utilizes both e\u03c4 h and \u00b5\u03c4 h pairs with slightly relaxed \u03c4 lepton identification criteria without imposing a charge requirement on the lepton pair. This yields a higher signal acceptance, but a larger irreducible background from SM processes. In order to keep the two samples statistically independent, events that satisfy the category A criteria are removed from the category B sample. Figure 1 shows a schematic representation of an LQ 3 LQ 3 decay chain that can satisfy the requirements for both categories.",

The missing transverse momentum p miss T is calculated as a negative vectorial sum of the transverse momenta of all the PF candidates. The missing transverse energy E miss T is defined as the magnitude of the p miss T vector. Jet energy corrections are applied to all jets and are also propagated to the calculation of E miss T [28]. The collisions are selected using a two-tiered trigger system, composed of a hardware based level-1 trigger and a software based high-level trigger (HLT) [29] running on a computing farm.",

            "text": "This analysis uses data collected with the CMS detector at the LHC during proton-proton (pp) collisions at \u221a s = 8 TeV. Proton bunches were separated by 50 ns and the average number of additional primary vertices in the collision of the two beams in the same proton bunch crossing was 20 (pileup). The search is conducted using a combination of isolated and non-isolated single-muon data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.5 fb \u22121 in category A, and using isolated single-muon or single-electron data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb \u22121 in category B. The muon triggers require a muon candidate to have p T > 24 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.1. The electron trigger requires an isolated electron candidate with p T > 27 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.5. The LQ signal processes have been simulated using the pythia generator (v6.426) [30]. Single top quark and top quark pair production have been simulated with powheg (v1.0) [31][32][33][34]. For the W+jets background, DY+jets processes, and tt production in association with W or Z bosons, MadGraph (v5.1) has been used [35]. Diboson and QCD multijet processes as well as processes involving Higgs bosons have been generated with pythia, other SM backgrounds have been simulated with MadGraph. The parton shower and hadronization in samples generated with powheg or MadGraph has been performed with pythia. In case of MadGraph, the matching to pythia has been done with the MLM scheme [36]. In all of the generated samples, \u03c4 lepton decays were simulated via tauola [37] and the response of the CMS detector has been simulated with Geant4 [38]. The powheg samples are produced with the CT10 [39] parton distribution function (PDF), all other samples have been generated using CTEQ6L1 [40] PDF set. The Monte Carlo (MC) simulated events are re-weighted to account for differences in trigger and lepton reconstruction efficiencies, pileup modeling, and jet/missing transverse energy response of the detector. The simulated events are normalized using next-to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO) (W+jets, DY+jets [41], tt+jets [42], WH, ZH [43]), approximate NNLO (t, tW [44]), NLO (diboson [45], ttZ [46], ttW [46,47], ttH [48,49], triboson [50]), or leading-order (W \u00b1 W \u00b1 qq, ttWW, W\u03b3 * , QCD multijet [30,35] The characteristics of the simulated tt+jets and W+jets events have been found to contain discrepancies when compared with measurements of the p T spectrum of top quarks [51] and the leading jet [52], respectively. Re-weighting factors, parametrized as functions of the respective p T distributions, are applied to the simulated events to correct for these discrepancies. The correction factors for tt+jets [51] range up to 30% whereas the correction factors for the W+jets samples vary between 8% and 12%.",

These are computed taking into account the total uncertainty in the mean number of expected events. A unit Z-score, |Z| = 1, refers to a two-tailed 1-standard deviation quantile (\u223c68%) of the normal distribution. For each selection, the observed number of events is found to be in an overall agreement with the SM-only hypothesis and the distributions reveal no statistically significant deviations from the SM expectations. A limit is set on the pair production cross section of charge \u22121/3 third-generation scalar LQs by using a combined likelihood fit in the ten search regions of category A and B. The theta tool [62] is used to produce Bayesian limits on the signal cross section, where the statistical and systematic uncertainties are treated as nuisance parameters. Statistical and systematic uncertainties that are specific to category A or B, such as the uncertainties in the backgrounds from misidentified leptons, are assumed to be uncorrelated, whereas common sources of systematic uncertainties are treated as fully correlated. The common uncertainties are the uncertainties in the jet energy scale and resolution, \u03c4 lepton and muon identification and isolation efficiencies, \u03c4 lepton energy scale and resolution, PDFs, and integrated luminosity.",

Assuming a unit branching fraction of LQ decays to top quark and \u03c4 lepton pairs, pair production of third-generation LQs is excluded for masses up to 685 GeV with an expected limit of 695 GeV. The exclusion limits worsen as the LQ 3 mass approaches the mass of the top quark because the LQ 3 decay products become softer. At M LQ 3 = 200 GeV, more than 90% of \u03c4 leptons originating from LQ 3 decays have p T < 60 GeV, which causes a decrease both in the signal selection efficiency and the discriminating performance of the \u03c4 lepton p T spectrum.
