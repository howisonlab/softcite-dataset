In the Standard Model (SM) in fact they proceed through diagrams with neutrinos in the loops: the strong GIM suppression, due to the small neutrino masses, leads to branching fractions that are below any achievable experimental sensitivity. On the other hand, in supersymmetric (SUSY) models, LFV \u03c4 and \u00b5 decays can receive significant contributions from diagrams containing SUSY particles in the loops, via slepton mixing. Depending on the model and the values of the free parameters of the theory (mass spectra and couplings), LFV \u03c4 decays may have branching fractions as high as 10 \u22127 (see e.g. [1]), thus within the reach of the BABAR experiment.",

Charged particles' momenta and impact parameters are measured by a tracking system, consisting of a silicon strip detector and a gaseous drift chamber in a solenoidal magnetic field of 1.5T. A Tl-doped CsI calorimeter identifies photons and electrons and determines their energy. Muons are identified by resistive plate chambers and limited streamer tubes installed in the gaps of the iron that contains the solenoid flux return. Kaon/pion discrimination is based on the opening angle and photon yield of the Cherenkov light emitted in synthetic quartz bars, and on ionization energy loss in the tracking devices. Through the years 2000-2008 BABAR has collected almost 1 billion \u03c4 leptons, produced in e + e \u2212 \u2192\u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 events. Here we consider only data taken at \u221a s \u2248 10.58 GeV (about 90% of the total \u03c4 sample). At this center-of-mass (CM) energy the \u03c4\u03c4 cross section, \u2248 0.92 nb, is comparable to that of dimuon production and about 1/5 of the hadronic cross section (e + e \u2212 \u2192qq, q = u, d, s, c, b). The effective cross section for Bhabha events where at least one e \u00b1 is within the acceptance of the calorimeter is about 50 times larger. We search for the LFV decays \u03c4 \u2192 ll l , lV 0 and lK 0 S , where l ( , ) = (e, \u00b5)",

We consider only one-prong tag \u03c4 decays (BF \u2248 85%), except for the eK 0 S analysis, where we include also three-prong decays (BF \u2248 15%). We thus divide the event in two hemispheres in the CM frame, by means of a plane perpendicular to the event's thrust axis, and require that the 3 charged particles' tracks from the signal \u03c4 and the tracks (1 or 3) from the tag \u03c4 decay belong to different hemispheres. All tracks must be well reconstructed, within the fiducial volume of the detector, and should have zero total charge. Pairs of tracks consistent with a photon conversion are removed in order to suppress radiative QED backgrounds. The invariant masses of the K 0 S and V 0 daughters are required to be close to the mass of the originating mother; the K 0 S decay vertex should be displaced from the interaction point. Tight e/\u00b5/\u03c0/K identification criteria, with \u2248 1% misidentification probability, are applied to the signal \u03c4 daughters. e/\u00b5 vetoes are applied in some cases to the track from 1-prong tag \u03c4 decays in order to reduce \u00b5 \u00b5 and Bhabha backgrounds. Finally, since the SM tag \u03c4 decay contains undetected neutrino(s), missing momentum must be different from zero and point inside the detector acceptance.",

In the (\u2206M, \u2206E) plane, signal should peak around the origin (with tails at negative \u2206E and positive \u2206M values due to radiation emitted in the initial and final state, respectively), while backgrounds should be more uniformly distributed. For each decay mode we define, in the (\u2206M, \u2206E) plane, a signal region (SR) around the origin, and an external sideband (SB) region. After applying tight selection requirements in order to reduce the backgrounds as much as possible, we compare the number of candidates observed in the SR and the expected background yield, extrapolated from the number of candidates in the SB. The SR extent and the selection criteria are optimized, using large samples of simulated signal and background events in addition to background-enriched data control samples, in order to minimize the expected branching fraction upper limits (UL) in the background-only hypothesis.",

Simulated events and backgroundenriched data control samples (obtained by relaxing or reverting some of the selection criteria) are used to extract the shapes of the probability density functions (PDFs) of the various background sources in the (\u2206M, \u2206E) plane and their relative abundance. The normalization of the total background PDF is fitted to the data in the SB, and the expected background in the SR is estimated from integration of the PDF in that range. After applying the tight selection criteria, only very few background events are expected in the SR. Several kinematic distributions and yields in slices of the SB are compared between data and simulated events in order to evalutate the reliability of the simulation.",

Comparing these quantities, taking into account the number N \u03c4 of \u03c4 leptons in the initial sample and the signal selection efficiency \u03b5 (from simulated events), we set upper limits between 1.8 and 19 \u00d710 \u22128 at 90% CL on the corresponding branching fractions. We use either a fully (ll l , lV 0 [6]) or \"modified\" (lK 0 S [7]) frequentist procedure: in the latter case we compare also the observed and expected (in the background-only and background+signal hypotheses) distributions of the \u03c7 2 of the geometric and kinematic fit to the whole signal \u03c4 decay tree. The quoted limits include the systematic uncertainties on N \u03c4 (\u2248 1%, from the luminosity uncertainty), \u03b5 (2-9%, dominated by the uncertainty on the particle-identification efficiency) and N bkg exp (typically < 0.3, from the uncertainties in the background PDF shapes and the overall background normalization). The results are summarized in Table 1 and illustrated in Figures 1 and 2. In several cases we improve previous experimental bounds. Some regions of the parameters' space of some SUSY models (like [1]) are excluded by these results. ",
