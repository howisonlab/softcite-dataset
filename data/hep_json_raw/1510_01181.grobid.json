            "text": "A search for a heavy scalar boson H decaying into a pair of lighter standard-model-like 125 GeV Higgs bosons hh and a search for a heavy pseudoscalar boson A decaying into a Z and an h boson are presented. The searches are performed on a data set corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb \u22121 of pp collision data at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV, collected by CMS in 2012. A final state consisting of two \u03c4 leptons and two b jets is used to search for the H \u2192 hh decay. A final state consisting of two \u03c4 leptons from the h boson decay, and two additional leptons from the Z boson decay, is used to search for the decay A \u2192 Zh. The results are interpreted in the context of two-Higgs-doublet models. No excess is found above the standard model expectation and upper limits are set on the heavy boson production cross sections in the mass ranges 260 < m H < 350 GeV and 220 < m A < 350 GeV.",

            "text": "The discovery of additional Higgs bosons at the LHC would provide direct evidence of physics beyond the standard model (SM). There are several types of models that require two Higgs doublets [1][2][3]. For example the minimal supersymmetric extension of the SM (MSSM) requires the introduction of an additional Higgs doublet, where one Higgs doublet couples to up-type quarks and the other to down-type quarks [4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11]. This leads to the prediction of five Higgs particles: one light and one heavy CP-even Higgs boson, h and H, one CP-odd Higgs boson A, and two charged Higgs bosons H \u00b1 [2,12]. The masses and couplings of these bosons are interrelated and, at tree level, can be described by two parameters, which are often chosen to be the mass of the pseudoscalar boson m A and the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the neutral components of the two Higgs doublets tan \u03b2. However, radiative corrections [13][14][15][16][17] introduce dependencies on other parameters namely the mass of the top quark m t , the scale of the soft supersymmetry breaking masses M SUSY , the higgsino mass parameter \u03bc, the wino mass parameter M 2 , the third-generation trilinear couplings, A t , A b , and A \u03c4 , the mass of the gluino mg, and the third-generation slepton mass parameter M\u02dc",

The choice of \u03c4 pair final state was driven by its quite clean signature and by the most recent results, which gave stronger evidence of the 125 Higgs boson coupling to the fermions [33]. This analysis exploits similar techniques as used for the search for the SM Higgs boson at 125 GeV [34] and several different \u03c4 \u03c4 signatures are studied. For the channel H \u2192 hh \u2192 bb\u03c4 \u03c4 , the \u03bc\u03c4 h , e\u03c4 h , and \u03c4 h \u03c4 h final states are used, where \u03c4 h denotes the visible products of a hadronically decaying \u03c4 , whereas for the channel A \u2192 Zh \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 , the \u03bc\u03c4 h , e\u03c4 h , \u03c4 h \u03c4 h , and e\u03bc final states are selected.",

The H \u2192 hh signals are modelled with the pythia 6.4.26 [43] event generator while the A \u2192 Zh signals were modelled with MadGraph 5.1 [44]. When modelling background processes, the MadGraph 5.1 generator is used for Z+jets, W+jets, tt, and diboson production, and powheg 1.0 [45][46][47][48] for single top quark production. The powheg and MadGraph generators are interfaced with pythia for parton showering and fragmentation using the Z2* tune [49]. All generators are interfaced with tauola [50] for the simulation of the \u03c4 decays. All generated events are processed through a detailed simulation of the CMS detector based on Geant4 [51] and are reconstructed with the same algorithms as the data.

A requirement on L h T , which is the scalar sum of the visible transverse momenta of the two \u03c4 candidates originating from the h boson, is applied to lower the reducible background from misidentified leptons as well as the irreducible background from ZZ production. The thresholds of this requirement depend on the final state and have been chosen in such a way as to optimise the sensitivity of the analysis to the presence of an A \u2192 Zh signal for A masses between 220 and 350 GeV. The distribution of L h T for events in the \u03c4 h \u03c4 h final state can be seen in Fig. 2.

For this reason, the \u03c4 lepton energies are constrained from the balance of the fitted H boson transverse momentum and the reconstructed transversal recoil determined from E miss T reconstruction algorithms, as described in Sec. 3. The reconstructed mass obtained with the kinematic fit is denoted by m kinfit H (see the Supplementary material for a detailed description). The signal-to-background ratio is greatly improved by selecting events that are consistent with a mass of 125 GeV for both the dijet (m bb ) mass and the ditau mass (m \u03c4 \u03c4 ) reconstructed with SVFit. The mass windows of the selections are optimised to collect as much signal as possible while rejecting a large part of the background. They correspond to 70 < m bb < 150 GeV and 90 < m \u03c4 \u03c4 < 150 GeV. The invariant mass distributions of the H boson in different final states are shown in Figs. 3, 4 and 5. For the A \u2192 Zh \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 process, the A boson mass is reconstructed from the four-vector information of the Z boson candidate and the four-vector information of the h boson candidate as obtained from SVFit. The invariant mass distributions of the A boson in the different final states are shown in Figs. 6 and 7. The \u03c4 h \u03c4 h final states have a comparable contribution from reducible and irreducible backgrounds, while the e\u03bc final states are dominated by the irreducible ZZ production.

In this region, events are required to pass all the final state selections, except that the reconstructed \u03c4 candidates are required to have the same sign and to pass relaxed identification and isolation criteria. This effectively eliminates any possible signal, while maintaining roughly the same proportion of reducible background events.",
