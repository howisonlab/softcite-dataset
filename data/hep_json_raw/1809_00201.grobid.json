The data, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3.42 \u00b5b \u22121 , were collected in 2017 by the CMS experiment at the LHC. The yields are reported as functions of collision centrality and transverse momentum, p T , from 0.5 to 100 GeV. A previously reported p T spectrum from proton-proton collisions at \u221a s = 5.02 TeV is used for comparison after correcting for the difference in center-of-mass energy. The nuclear modification factors using this reference, R * AA , are constructed and compared to previous measurements and theoretical predictions. In head-on collisions, the R * AA has a value of 0.17 in the p T range of 6-8 GeV, but increases to approximately 0.7 at 100 GeV. Above \u22486 GeV, the XeXe data show a notably smaller suppression than previous results for lead-lead (PbPb) collisions at \u221a s NN = 5.02 TeV when compared at the same centrality (i.e., the same fraction of total cross section). However, the XeXe suppression is slightly greater than that for PbPb in events having a similar number of participating nucleons.",

            "text": "The transverse momentum (p T ) spectrum of charged particles is a well-studied observable for examining the hot, dense quark-gluon plasma (QGP) created in high-energy heavy ion collisions. As scattered partons traverse this medium, they experience a loss of energy due to quantum chromodynamics processes such as gluon emission and parton splitting [1]. Because high-p T charged particles are produced through parton fragmentation and subsequent hadronization, their yields are sensitive to the strength of QGP-induced energy loss [2,3]. In contrast, production of charged particles having p T less than a few GeV is particularly sensitive to initial parton densities and hydrodynamic expansion of the medium [4][5][6][7]. Modification of charged-particle yields can be quantified by forming a ratio of the spectra in nucleus-nucleus (AA) and pp collisions, where the latter are multiplied by the average number of binary nucleon-nucleon collisions per AA event, N coll . This observable is known as the nuclear modification factor, R AA , and is given by",

These analyses found R AA to be strongly suppressed in head-on collisions, with minima around p T = 5 GeV. Measurements made at the CERN LHC by the ALICE [13,14], ATLAS [15], and CMS [16,17] Collaborations have explored the same observables in lead-lead (PbPb) collisions at \u221a s NN = 2.76 and 5.02 TeV. These studies found minima of R AA around 0.15 at p T = 8 GeV. They also indicate that R AA increases to values around 0.7 at p T = 100 GeV. Complementary measurements of the nuclear modification factor in proton-lead (pPb) collisions at \u221a s NN = 5.02 TeV indicate that high-p T charged-particle yields are not strongly modified in this smaller colliding system, ruling out effects related to the initial-state conditions of the lead nucleus as a cause of the high-p T suppression seen in PbPb collisions [14,17,18]. Together, these observations indicate strong p T -dependent energy loss due to the presence of the QGP in heavy ion collisions.",

Therefore, the xenon-xenon (XeXe) data provide a unique opportunity to explore the properties of the QGP using an intermediate size collision system at LHC energies. Xenon collisions also provide an opportunity to test the system size dependence of parton energy loss. The radii of xenon and lead nuclei are \u22485.4 and \u22486.6 fm, respectively [19]. Assuming the energy loss of a parton is linearly (quadratically) related to only its path length through the QGP would imply an average reduction in energy loss of 17 (31)% in head-on XeXe collisions as compared to PbPb collisions. This difference could manifest itself in comparisons of the charged-particle spectra between the two systems. Recent results from the ALICE Collaboration indicate this is the case, with the R AA of head-on XeXe collisions being less suppressed than that of PbPb collisions [20]. Comparisons of copper-copper and gold-gold collisions at RHIC have also motivated similar conclusions [21][22][23][24].",

For the purposes of this model, the nucleonnucleon inelastic cross section \u03c3 inel NN is taken as 68.4 \u00b1 0.5 mb [33]. The nuclear radius and skin depth are set as 5.36 \u00b1 0.1 fm and 0.59 \u00b1 0.07 fm, respectively [19]. Additionally, the nuclear deformation parameter of the xenon nucleus is taken to be \u03b2 2 = 0.18 \u00b1 0.02 [34]. Simulated epos events are used to account for bin-to-bin smearing in centrality caused by fluctuations and the energy resolution of the HF calorimeters [8]. The resulting values and uncertainties are given in table 1 for XeXe collisions at \u221a s NN = 5.44 TeV. For the purpose of calculating R Xe Pb , the same quantities in PbPb collisions at 5.02 TeV are also given. The procedure for calculating the PbPb values is described in ref. [17]. The uncertainties in the PbPb values include a component related to the uncertainty in the PbPb event selection efficiency. However, the effect of the XeXe event selection efficiency uncertainty is much larger than in PbPb collisions. Therefore, this component is not propagated to the uncertainty in the XeXe values and is accounted for with a separate systematic uncertainty. In this paper, the definition of R AA containing T AA , given in eq. (1.2), is used.",

The track p T resolution is <1.5% for the full p T range of this study. The tracking efficiency, defined as the fraction of primary charged particles successfully reconstructed after track quality selections, is shown in figure 1. The shaded bands around each line show statistical uncertainties. The efficiency has a fairly constant value around 70% (76%) in the range 3 < p T < 100 GeV for central (peripheral) events. Because of the stringent track selection criteria, the efficiency decreases to a value of 13% at p T = 0.5 GeV in the 0-5% centrality range, and to 30% in the 70-80% centrality range. The rate at which erroneous tracks not associated with a charged particle are generated, or the misreconstruction rate, is less than 1% for most of the p T range studied. However, it does increase quickly for tracks having p T < 0.7 GeV in the 0-5% centrality range, reaching a maximum value of 34% at p T = 0.5 GeV. The effects of tracking inefficiency, misreconstruction, and nonprimary contamination are all corrected for by applying a weight to each track. This correction is parameterized as a function of the track p T and event centrality. The tracking efficiency for a charged particle at a given p T depends on its species. Additionally, some charged particles, notably the strange baryons, are more likely to decay into secondary particles which then contaminate the sample. These effects lead to a model dependence of the total tracking correction, because different MC event generators predict dissimilar relative fractions of each type of charged particle. Notably, pythia tends to underpredict strange hadron production in pp collisions [14], while epos is found to overestimate the production of many strange hadrons in central PbPb collisions [37]. Thus, the fraction of strange baryons in data is expected to be bounded by that of epos and of the embedded particles in a hydjet-embedded pythia sample. Following the procedure detailed in ref. [17], a working point is chosen that lies halfway between the tracking corrections produced by these two generators. The deviation between the estimated tracking corrections from the two generators reaches a maximum of 8% around p T = 4 GeV but is less than 3% for p T > 10 GeV.",

After this scaling procedure, the relative change of the misreconstruction rate in the signal region (less than 3 standard deviations) is taken as the systematic uncertainty. This is < 2% for most of the data in this analysis. For tracks having p T < 0.7 GeV in central events, however, it quickly grows to a value of 16%.",

A ratio of each model to the data is provided in the bottom panels of the figure. The green lines show the predictions of a linear Boltzmann transport (LBT) model of jet quenching, which uses the CLV isc hydrodynamics model for medium evolution [49,50]. This model predicts a quadratic path-length dependence of energy loss in a static medium. It lies on the upper edge of the systematic uncertainty of the 0-10% measurement in the range 20 < p T < 60 GeV, but otherwise agrees with the data well. The orange band is a model by Djordjevic that uses a dynamical energy loss formalism [51,52]. For this model, the medium undergoes Bjorken expansion, and the path-length dependence of energy loss is expected to be between linear and quadratic. The prediction is compatible with the data in both centrality ranges except around p T = 5 GeV, where it is slightly below the data. The magenta region represents the prediction from cujet3.1/cibjet model, which incorporates two components [53,54]. The first is a jet quenching model (cujet3.1) that includes the suppression of quark and gluon degrees of freedom and the emergence of chromo-magnetic monopole degrees of freedom. The second component, the cibjet framework, calculates the dependence of correlations between soft and hard azimuthal flow harmonics on an event-by-event basis. This model describes the 0-10% data well, but lies on the lower edge of the data's uncertainty in the 30-50% centrality range. The red line shows a prediction of Andr\u00e9s et al. that uses a 'quenching weights' formalism to estimate the behavior of the medium transport coefficient,q [55]. The evolution of the medium in this model is done with EKRT event-by-event hydrodynamics. The prediction tends to agree with the top edge of the data's uncertainty range in the 0-10% centrality range. The light blue band shows a prediction from soft-collinear effective theory with Glauber gluons (SCET G ) [56,57]. The evolution of the background medium is modeled with the JHEP10(2018)138 ",

This suppression is less than what has been observed in a matching centrality range of lead-lead (PbPb) collisions at a centerof-mass energy per nucleon pair of 5.02 TeV, even when accounting for the difference in collision energy. In contrast, charged-particle production in XeXe collisions is found to be slightly more suppressed than in PbPb collisions that have a similar number of participating nucleons rather than a similar centrality. Taken together, these observations illustrate the importance that collision system size and geometry have on the strength of parton energy loss. Predictions from the Djordjevic, SCET G and cujet3. linear Boltzmann transport model also agree with the data, except for the kinematic range 15 < p T < 40 GeV in central events, where they follow the upper edge of the data's uncertainty. These measurements help elucidate the nature of parton energy loss in XeXe collisions and constrain the system size dependence of hot nuclear medium effects.",
