In the Standard Model the CKM matrix is unitary, leading to the condition V ud V * ub +V cd V * cb +V td V * tb = 0, where V ij are the CKM matrix elements. This relation is represented as a triangle in the complex plane, with angles \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3, and an area proportional to the amount of CP violation in the quark sector of the Standard Model [3]. Overconstraining this unitarity triangle may lead to signs of physics beyond the Standard Model. The CKM angle \u03b3 \u2261 arg",

The uncertainties on the indirect measurement are expected to decrease as lattice QCD calculations become more accurate. Therefore, precision at the level of 1 \u2022 on a direct measurement of \u03b3 would test the consistency of the direct and indirect measurements and thereby the Standard Model.

The first employs D decays into the CP -even eigenstates K + K \u2212 and \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ; these are referred to here as the \"GLW\" decay modes [9,10]. The second class of decay modes involves D decays to K \u2213 \u03c0 \u00b1 , which is not a CP eigenstate. In the favoured decay, the pion from the D meson and that from the K * \u2212 meson have opposite charge, while in the suppressed decay (referred to here as the \"ADS\" [11,12] decay mode) the pion from the D meson that from the K * \u2212 meson have the same charge. The favoured mode is used as a control mode for many aspects of the analysis since no CP asymmetry is expected. The ADS decay mode is a combination of a CKM-favoured B \u2212 \u2192 D 0 K * \u2212 decay, followed by a doubly Cabibbo-suppressed D 0 \u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212 decay, and a CKM-and colour-suppressed B \u2212 \u2192 D 0 K * \u2212 decay, followed by a Cabibbo-favoured D 0 \u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212 decay. Both paths to the same final state have amplitudes of similar size, and interference effects are therefore magnified in comparison to the GLW decay modes, where the decay path via the CKM-favoured B \u2212 \u2192 D 0 K * \u2212 dominates. Studies of B \u2212 \u2192 DK \u2212 and B 0 \u2192 DK * 0 decays have been published by the LHCb collaboration [6,13].",

            "text": "The asymmetries A K\u03c0 and A K\u03c0\u03c0\u03c0 should be essentially zero due to the very small interference expected in the configuration of B and D decays. Due to negligible direct CP violation in D decays [19], the observables A KK and A \u03c0\u03c0 should be equal and are often labelled together as A CP + ; similarly the observables R KK and R \u03c0\u03c0 should be equal and are labelled R CP + . The analogous observables to R CP + and A CP + for the ADS mode are R ADS and A ADS . However, R ADS and A ADS are not used for the ADS decay mode, instead the ratios are measured separately for the positive and negative charges. The reason for this choice is that the uncertainty in A ADS depends on the value of R ADS , therefore these observables are statistically dependent, raising problems for the low yields expected in the ADS mode. Hence the statistically independent observables R + K\u03c0 and R \u2212 K\u03c0 are preferred. The CP observables measured in this analysis can be related to the physics parameters to be determined, namely \u03b3, r B and \u03b4 B . The parameter r B is the ratio of the magnitudes between the suppressed and favoured amplitudes of the B decay and \u03b4 B is the strong-phase difference between these amplitudes. The expected value is r B \u223c 0.1, similar to that in the B \u2212 \u2192 DK \u2212 decay. Both r B and \u03b4 B are averaged over the region of DK 0 S \u03c0 \u2212 phase space corresponding to the K * \u2212 selection window. A coherence factor, \u03ba, accounts for the contribution of B \u2212 \u2192 DK 0 S \u03c0 \u2212 decays that are not due to an intermediate K * (892) \u2212 resonance [20], where \u03ba = 1 denotes a pure K * (892) \u2212 contribution. Given there is a negligible effect from both charm mixing [21] and CP violation in D decays [19], the relationships between the CP observables and physics parameters are given in the following equations,  ",

The parameters r K\u03c0 D and \u03b4 K\u03c0 D are the magnitude of the amplitude ratio and the strong-phase difference between the suppressed and favoured amplitudes of the D decay, namely D 0 \u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212 and D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + respectively [22]. Similarly, the parameters r K3\u03c0 D and \u03b4 K3\u03c0 D are the equivalent quantities for the decays D 0 \u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + , averaged over phase space [23,24].

The parameter F 4\u03c0 \u223c 0.75 [15] accounts for the fact that D \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , though predominantly CP even, is not a pure CP eigenstate.",

The detector includes a high-precision tracking system consisting of a silicon-strip vertex detector (VELO) surrounding the pp interaction region, a large-area silicon-strip detector (TT) located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4 Tm, and three stations of silicon-strip detectors and straw drift tubes placed downstream of the magnet. The tracking system provides a measurement of momentum, p, of charged particles with a relative uncertainty that varies from 0.5% at low momentum to 1.0% at 200 GeV/c. The minimum distance of a track to a primary vertex (PV), the impact parameter (IP), is measured with a resolution of (15 + 29/p T ) \u00b5m, where p T is the component of the momentum transverse to the beam, in GeV/c. Different types of charged hadrons are distinguished using information from two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors (RICH). Photons, electrons and hadrons are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter and a hadronic calorimeter. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers, and gas electron multiplier detectors.",

There are several differences between data collected in Run 1 and Run 2. The main difference is the higher bb production cross-section in Run 2 [29]. The average number of pp interactions per bunch crossing is reduced to 1.1 in Run 2 compared to 1.7 in Run 1. The net effect is that, despite the higher energy of the collisions, the background levels and signal-to-background ratios in Run 1 and Run 2 for the type of decay analysed here are similar. Before the start of Run 2, the aerogel radiator was removed from the first RICH detector [30], which improves the detector resolution.

A kinematic fit [40] is performed on the full B decay chain constraining the B candidate to point towards the PV, and the D and K 0 S candidates to have their known masses [39]. To suppress charmless backgrounds, the D decay vertex is required to be well-separated from and downstream of the B \u2212 decay vertex. Also, the K 0 S decay vertex is required to be well-separated from and downstream of the B \u2212 decay vertex in order to suppress B \u2212 \u2192 D\u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decays.

Further suppression of these decays is achieved by requiring the magnitude of the cosine of the K 0 S helicity angle to be greater than 0.3. The K 0 S helicity angle is defined as the angle between the K 0 S and the B \u2212 momentum vectors in the K * \u2212 rest frame. This requirement retains 97% of true K * \u2212 decays, which are distributed parabolically in this variable, while rejecting 30% of the background. Requirements, based mainly on the RICH system, are applied to all D decay products to identify them as kaons or pions. These selections are applied such that each D candidate is assigned a unique category. Cross-feed between the K \u2212 \u03c0 + , K + K \u2212 and \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 D final states is negligible because after misidentification of a \u03c0 \u2212 meson as a K \u2212 meson (or vice versa) the reconstructed mass of the D meson lies outside the D mass selection window.

The selection efficiency for various D decay modes accounts for any differences in kinematics between these modes as well as a tighter BDT cut in the ADS decay mode, which is applied in order to optimise the uncertainty in the CP observables. Any further correction to the four-body observables due to nonuniform acceptance was found to be negligible. The efficiencies cancel for the determination of the CP asymmetries, while corrections are applied for the B + , B \u2212 production asymmetry, A prod , and decay mode dependent detection asymmetries, A det , which are taken from previous LHCb measurements for production asymmetry [45], kaon detection asymmetry [46] and pion detection asymmetry [47]. The value A prod is assumed to be the same for 7 TeV, 8 TeV and 13 TeV data. A possible difference in A prod for Run 2 data compared to Run 1 is accounted for as a systematic uncertainty. As the asymmetries are small, O(1%) or less, the observed uncorrected asymmetry A raw can be expressed as the sum A raw = A phys + A prod + A det , where A phys is the CP asymmetry to be extracted. Hence, A prod and A det provide additive corrections to the measured asymmetry.",

Uncertainties on A prod and A det are taken from previous LHCb measurements in Run 1 [45][46][47].

For A prod , a conservative estimate, double the Run 1 uncertainty, is assigned to accommodate a possible dependence of the production asymmetry on the centre-ofmass energy. The systematic uncertainties due to the use of fixed inputs from branching ratios, simulation efficiencies, asymmetry corrections and shape parameters are estimated by performing multiple fits to data where each relevant parameter is varied according to a Gaussian distribution with the width as the assigned uncertainty. The standard deviation of the fitted parameter distribution is assigned as the systematic uncertainty. Correlations between the shape parameters are small, typically less than 10%, and are ignored.

The systematic uncertainties from these sources are computed by generating pseudoexperiments. In each case the generated model is varied according to the systematic effects being estimated. The systematic uncertainty on each observable is taken to be the difference between the mean of the fitted parameter distribution and the generated value. The systematic uncertainty on the partially reconstructed background takes into account uncertainties in the yield and shape parameters, as well as possible asymmetries due to CP violation. The contamination from charmless B decays is consistent with zero, although it has a large uncertainty. Pseudoexperiments are generated with charmless decays according to the fit model, with the number of events fluctuating according to the uncertainty in the fit. The assumption that the slope of the function describing the combinatorial background is the same for all D decay modes has an associated uncertainty. Pseudoexperiments are generated fixing the slope parameters to a different value for each decay mode, where the value used is obtained from fits in the mass region above the B mass. For the ADS mode, a potential background from B 0 s \u2192 D(K * (1410) 0 \u2192 K * (892) \u2212 \u03c0 + ), where the \u03c0 + meson is not reconstructed, is considered.

The CP observables R CP + , A CP + , R + K\u03c0 , R \u2212 K\u03c0 , R \u03c0\u03c0\u03c0\u03c0 , A \u03c0\u03c0\u03c0\u03c0 , R + K\u03c0\u03c0\u03c0 and R \u2212 K\u03c0\u03c0\u03c0 are measured from the high purity sample obtained from pp collision data recorded with the LHCb detector in Run 1 and Run 2. The measurement of the CP asymmetries in the two-body decay modes and their ratio to the favoured decay mode is consistent with and more precise than the previous determination [16]. While no bounds on \u03b3 are quoted due to the limited sensitivity of this decay mode in isolation, B \u2212 \u2192 DK * \u2212 decays will become valuable in constraining \u03b3 in the future, as more data are collected and more D decay modes are analysed.",
