The data collected by the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC correspond to an integrated luminosity of 12.9 fb \u22121 . No deviations are observed relative to the predictions of the standard model. The results are interpreted as exclusion limits on the dark matter production cross sections and parameters in models containing extra spatial dimensions. Improved limits are set with respect to previous searches using the monophoton final state. In particular, the limits on the extra dimension model parameters are the most stringent to date in this channel.",

While DM is thought to be the dominant nonbaryonic contribution to the matter density of the universe [1], its detection and identification in terrestrial and spaceborne experiments remains elusive. At the CERN LHC, the DM particles may be produced in high-energy proton-proton collisions, if the DM particles interact with the standard model (SM) quarks or gluons via new couplings at the electroweak scale [2,3]. Although DM particles cannot be directly detected at the LHC, their production could be inferred from an observation of events with a large transverse momentum imbalance (missing transverse momentum, p miss T , defined in section 2).",

Proposed solutions to this problem include theories with large extra dimensions, such as the model of Arkani-Hamed, Dimopoulos, Dvali (ADD) [5,6]. The ADD model postulates that there exist n compactified extra dimensions in which gravitons can propagate freely and that the true scale (M D ) of the gravitational interaction in this 4+n dimensional space-time is of the same order as M EW . The compactification scale R of the additional dimensions is related to the two gravitational scales by M 2 Pl \u223c R n M n+2 D .

The compactification scale R is much greater than 1/M EW for a wide range of n, leading to a near-continuous mass spectrum of Kaluza-Klein graviton states. Although the gravitons would not be observed directly at the LHC, their production would be manifest as events broadly distributed in p miss T . In generic models of DM and graviton production, various SM particles can recoil against these undetected particles, producing a variety of final states with significant p miss T . The monophoton, or \u03b3 + p miss T , final state has the advantage of being identifiable with high efficiency and purity. In DM production through a vector or axial vector mediator, a photon can be radiated from incident quarks (figure 1 left). Models of this process have been developed by the CMS-ATLAS Dark Matter Forum [7]. It is also possible that the DM sector couples preferentially to the electroweak sector, leading to an effective interaction qq \u2192 Z/\u03b3 * \u2192 \u03b3\u03c7\u03c7 [8], where \u03c7 is the DM particle (figure 1 center). In ADD graviton production, the graviton can couple directly to the photon (figure 1 right) or to a quark. In this paper, we examine final states containing large p miss T in the presence of a photon with large transverse momentum (p T ), and search for an excess of events over the SM prediction. Data collected by the CMS experiment in 2016 with an integrated luminosity of 12.9 fb \u22121 are analyzed. Results are interpreted in the context of these three models.",

In addition to the selection efficiency correction factor \u03c1, these samples are weighted event-by-event with the product of two factors. The first factor matches the distribution of the generator-level p \u03b3 T to that calculated at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in QCD using the DYRes program [29]. The second factor, taken from refs. [30,31], further corrects the backgrounds to account for next-to-leading order (NLO) electroweak effects. The estimated contributions from the Z(\u2192 \u03bd\u03bd) + \u03b3 and W(\u2192 \u03bd) + \u03b3 processes after applying the selections in section 3 are given in table 1, and amount to 215 \u00b1 32 and 57.2 \u00b1 8.0 events, respectively. Statistical and systematic uncertainties are combined in quadrature. The statistical uncertainty is subdominant and is due to the finite size of the simulation sample. Systematic uncertainties in the estimated Z(\u2192 \u03bd\u03bd)+\u03b3 and W(\u2192 \u03bd)+\u03b3 yields have four contributions and are summarized in table 2. The first is associated with the PDF and the choice of renormalization and factorization scales (\u00b5 R and \u00b5 F ) used in generating the events. The relative uncertainty from these sources are 5.4% and 8.9% in the Z(\u2192 \u03bd\u03bd) + \u03b3 and W(\u2192 \u03bd) + \u03b3 yields, respectively. Uncertainty from the PDF is evaluated by varying the weight of each event based on the standard deviation of the event weight distribution as given by the NNPDF set. Uncertainties from the choice of \u00b5 R and \u00b5 F are evaluated by setting the scales to twice or half the nominal values and taking the minima and maxima of the resulting event weights. Second, the uncertainty due to missing higher-order electroweak corrections is taken as the magnitude of the NLO correction. The uncertainty from this source is 11% for the Z(\u2192 \u03bd\u03bd) + \u03b3 process and 7% for W(\u2192 \u03bd) + \u03b3. The third uncertainty is on the selection efficiency correction factor \u03c1, with the main contribution from the statistical uncertainties in individual efficiency measurements. A fourth uncertainty is assigned to cover the uncertainties in the jet energy scale [32], photon energy scale [33], pileup, and the scale and resolution in p miss T . The combined relative uncertainties from the third and fourth categories in the Z(\u2192 \u03bd\u03bd) + \u03b3 and W(\u2192 \u03bd) + \u03b3 yields are 6% and 6.2%, respectively.",

This process is estimated by counting the numbers of events in two different subsets of a lowp miss T multijet data sample. The first subset consists of events with a photon candidate that satisfies the signal selection criteria. These events contain both true photons and jets that are misidentified as photons. The second subset comprises events with a candidate photon that meets less stringent shower-shape requirements and inverted isolation criteria with respect to the signal candidates. Nearly all of the candidate photons in these events arise from JHEP10(2017)073 jet misidentification. The hadron misidentification ratio is defined as the ratio between the number of the misidentified events in the first subset to the total number of events in the second subset. The numerator is estimated by fitting the shower shape distribution of the photon candidate in the first subset with template distributions. For true photons, a template for the shower width is formed using simulated \u03b3+jets events. For jets misidentified as photons, the template is obtained from a sample selected by inverting the charged-hadron isolation and removing the shower-shape requirement entirely. Once the hadron misidentification ratio is computed, it is multiplied by the number of events in the high-p miss T control sample with a photon candidate that satisfies the conditions used to select the second subset of the low-p miss T control sample. The product, 5.9 \u00b1 1.7 events, is the estimate of the contribution of jet misidentification background in the signal region.

The distribution of the cluster seed time provides a cross-check on this background estimate and an independent means to estimate the ECAL spikes contribution. Exploiting these features, a two-component fit of the \u03c6 distribution with beam halo and uniform templates, and a three-component fit of the cluster seed time using the halo, spike, and prompt-photon templates are performed. In both fits, the halo template is obtained by requiring high halo total energy for candidate-like photon candidates. The timing distribution of the spike background is obtained by inverting the shower shape requirement in the candidate photon selection. The results of the two fits are combined into an uncertainty-weighted average.

In the models considered in this analysis, Dirac DM particles couple to a vector or axial-vector mediator, which in turn couples to the SM quarks. Model points are identified by a set of four parameters: the DM mass m DM , the mediator mass M med , the universal mediator coupling to quarks g q , and the mediator coupling to DM particles g DM . In this analysis, we fix the values of g q and g DM to 0.25 and 1.0, respectively, and scan the M med -m DM plane [38]. The search is not yet sensitive to the spin-0 mediator models defined in ref. [7]. Figure 3 shows the 95% CL cross section upper limits with respect to the corresponding theoretical cross section (\u00b5 95 = \u03c3 95% /\u03c3 theory ) for the vector and axial-vector mediator scenarios, in the M med -m DM plane. The solid red (lighter) and black (darker) curves are the expected and observed contours of \u00b5 95 = 1 (exclusion contour). The region with \u00b5 95 < 1 is excluded under nominal \u03c3 theory hypotheses. The uncertainty in the expected upper limit includes the experimental uncertainties. The uncertainty in the theoretical cross section is translated to the uncertainty in the observed exclusion contour. While there is little difference in kinematic properties between the two scenarios, the production cross section for heavier dark matter in the vector mediator scenario tends to be higher [7], and therefore the exclusion region broader. For the simplified DM models considered, mediator masses of up to 700 GeV are excluded for small m DM values. The exclusion contours in figure 3 are also translated into the \u03c3 SI/SD -m DM plane, where \u03c3 SI/SD are the spin-independent/dependent DM-nucleon scattering cross sections. The translation and presentation of the result follows the prescription given in ref. [38]. In particular, to enable a direct comparison with results from direct detection experiments, these limits are calculated at 90% CL [7]. When compared to the direct detection experiments, the limits obtained from this search provide stronger constraints for dark matter masses less than 2 GeV, assuming spin-independent scattering, or less than 200 GeV, for spin-dependent scattering.",

No deviations from the standard model predictions are observed. Constraints are set on the production cross sections for dark matter and large extra dimension gravitons at 95% confidence level, which are then translated to limits on the parameters of the individual models. For the simplified dark matter production models considered, the search excludes mediator masses of up to 700 GeV for low-mass dark matter. For an effective dimension-7 photon-dark matter contact interaction, values of \u039b up to 600 GeV are excluded. For the ADD model with extra spatial dimensions, values of the fundamental Planck scale up to 2.31-2.49 TeV, depending on the number of extra dimensions, are excluded. These are the most stringent limits in the ADD model to date using the monophoton final state.",
