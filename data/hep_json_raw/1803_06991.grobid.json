            "text": "Jets are collimated sprays of particles, produced in abundance in high energy particle collisions. They are ubiquitous in particle collider experiments and indispensable to study the underlying dynamics and interactions. Jets have played a central role in the discovery and property measurements of many fundamental particles like the gluon (g) (Barber et al., 1979;Berger et al., 1979;Brandelik et al., 1979;Bartel et al., 1980) and the top quark (t) (Abe et al., 1995;Abachi et al., 1995a). They have provided key insight into the structure of the strong force and were indispensable in the study of Higgs boson (H) couplings to heavy third generation quarks (Aaboud et al., 2018a(Aaboud et al., , 2018bSirunyan et al., 2018aSirunyan et al., , 2018b). Because of their large production rate at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), jets feature prominently in searches for new particles and precision measurements of standard model (SM) properties. However, important information on the underlying particle dynamics is not only carried by the total four-momenta of jets, but also by their internal structure. Investigations of this jet substructure reveal a wealth of physical processes and pose interesting theoretical and experimental challenges. While relatively young, the field of jet substructure has become an important field of research over the last decade and will gain further importance with the future data taking periods at the LHC.",

            "text": "With the advent of the LHC it was realized that decays of hypothetical, very heavy resonances can lead to highly Lorentz-boosted heavy SM particles, W, Z, H bosons and top quarks (Seymour, 1994;Butterworth, Cox, and Forshaw, 2002;Agashe et al., 2008;Butterworth et al., 2008;Kaplan et al., 2008). Since these particles feature the largest branching fractions into hadrons, final states with fully hadronic decays have high sensitivity in LHC analyses. The large boost leads to very collimated decays, where particle masses of O\u00f0100\u00de GeV are not large enough for the outgoing quarks to be sufficiently separated relative to each other to be resolved into individual jets. It is this small opening angle between the decay products which leads to fully merged particle decays. The following experimental overview describes techniques for measuring jets as proxies for hadronic decays of W, Z, H bosons and top quarks. However, this review is not limited to these methods but covers also precision jet substructure measurements and the discrimination of quark and gluon jets, reflecting the versatility of jet substructure. The scientific gains from these measurements are manifold, reaching from precision studies of QCD over the determination of fundamental parameters of the standard model to searches for new physical phenomena at the highest energy scales. A recent review on the theoretical aspects of jet substructure was given by Larkoski, Moult, and Nachman (2017).",

            "text": "Since the first evidence for jets in e \u00fe e \u2212 collisions at SPEAR (Hanson et al., 1975), jets have had a significant impact on the research program of every particle collider since DORIS through the LHC and beyond to the design of future colliders. There is no single, universal definition of a jet-which particles belong to a jet depend on the algorithm used to combine particles into jets. In the beginning of jets from the mid-1970s, there were no jet clustering algorithms; information from the whole event was used instead of localized energy flows. The sphericity tensor (Bjorken and Brodsky, 1970) was typically used to obtain a jet axis for events with a back-to-back dijet topology. Quantitative statements about data were obtained from event shapes, like the sphericity or thrust (Brandt et al., 1964;Farhi, 1977). Sphericity is a measure for the isotropy of the produced particles and thrust is a measure of the directed energy flow along an axis that maximizes this flow in an event. These event shapes can be used to characterize how compatible events are with the assumption of two oppositely directed, collimated jets. A clear theoretical advantage of these event shapes is that they are calculable in perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD). This was realized early on and the calculability ultimately resulted in the confirmation of the parton model and, with data from experiments at higher ffiffi ffi s p , the discovery of the gluon in three jet events at PETRA (Barber et al., 1979;Berger et al., 1979;Brandelik et al., 1979;Bartel et al., 1980). When studying the dynamics of quark and gluon scattering, it became necessary to perform quantitative analyses and calculations that go beyond event shapes. For these to be possible, it was realized that it is mandatory to define a deterministic set of rules on how particles are combined into jets. A schematic drawing depicting this problem is shown in Fig. 1. While the sphericity axis is uniquely defined and easily calculable, the direction and magnitude of the jet axes depend on which particles should be combined into a given jet, and how the particles are combined to obtain the axes. An intuitive definition for a jet algorithm consists of summing the momenta of all particles within a cone with fixed size (Sterman and Weinberg, 1977). Naive cone algorithms are not infared and collinear (IRC) safe-the requirement that the resulting jets be insensitive to arbitrarily low energy particles and collinear splittings. IRC safety is a useful theoretical requirement for making calculations in pQCD and is also a convenient language for describing the experimental robustness to noise and detector granularity.",

Although this algorithm is IRC safe, it is not widely used today because it was found that sequential recombination algorithms have several advantages over cone-type algorithms. First used by the JADE Collaboration (Bartel et al., 1986;Bethke et al., 1988), the initial version of a recombination algorithm defined for e \u00fe e \u2212 collisions was improved in several steps (Catani et al., 1991;Catani, Dokshitzer, and Webber, 1992) to finally arrive at the longitudinally invariant k T -clustering algorithm for hadron-hadron collisions (Catani et al., 1993).

(1), clusters soft and collinear particles first, the Cambridge/Aachen (CA) algorithm (Dokshitzer et al., 1997;Wobisch and Wengler, 1998), with k \u00bc 0, prioritizes particles in the clustering solely by their angular proximity, and the anti-k T algorithm (Cacciari, Salam, and Soyez, 2008a), with k \u00bc \u22121, combines the hardest particles first. The proposal of the latter algorithm is also responsible for the disappearance of cone-type algorithms in experimental studies. When it was realized that the anti-k T algorithm results in nearly perfect conical jets the LHC Collaborations made a transition to this algorithm. Today, almost all studies involving jets performed at the LHC use this algorithm. Even when analyzing the substructure of jets with advanced grooming or tagging techniques, the initial step often consists of building an ensemble of particles that were clustered with the anti-k T algorithm. So far, it has not been specified what the term particle refers to when using particles as input to jet clustering. In fact, in jet physics the term particle is often used generically for different sorts of objects, whose ensemble comprises the input to a given jet algorithm. Three different ensembles are commonly used. The partonic final state includes all particles resulting from the parton shower before the hadronization starts (which is unphysical). This also includes photons when these were created in the hard interaction or emitted from charged particles during the parton shower. The ensemble on the particle level, also called the hadron level, consists of hadrons and their decay products, including photons and leptons. The detector-level input consists of calorimeter clusters, reconstructed particle tracks, or combinations thereof. Jet algorithms using these different ensembles as input result in parton-, particle-, or detector-level jets, respectively. Ideally, in any given event, the jets obtained on parton, particle, and detector levels are as similar as possible. Realistically, agreement cannot be achieved, but a close correspondence ensures the possibility to study the underlying partonic dynamics with the use of jets. It is this correspondence, paired with calculability in pQCD, that makes jets indispensable tools at high energy particle colliders. 2 Soon after their discovery, it was realized that not only the kinematics of jets but also their internal structure carries information. The parton shower and subsequent hadronization leads to a characteristic multiplicity, as well as angular and momentum distributions of hadrons inside jets, which depend on the parton that initiated the shower. For example, the probability of a q \u2192 qg splitting is proportional to the color factor C F \u00bc 4=3 at leading order in QCD, while the probability of g \u2192 gg is proportional to C A \u00bc 3. The larger value of C A results in a larger multiplicity of hadrons and in broader jets. This leads to the suggestion of measuring jet shapes, defined as the fractional transverse momentum profile of particles within a concentric inner cone, smaller than the jet cone of the original jet, and pointed to their usefulness for distinguishing quark jets from gluon jets (Ellis, Kunszt, and Soper, 1992). Experimental results from LEP (Alexander et al., 1991;Buskulic et al., 1995;Abreu et al., 1996;Acciarri et al., 1997), Tevatron (Abe et al., 1993;Abachi et al., 1995b), and HERA (Breitweg et al., 1998(Breitweg et al., , 1999Adloff et al., 1999) confirmed this and can be considered as the starting point of physics with jet substructure in particle physics.",

The difficulty lies in identifying the underlying process that led to the final state, for example, distinguishing W \u2192 qq 0 , Z \u2192 qq, or H \u2192 bb from QCD splittings like q \u2192 qg, g \u2192 gg, or g \u2192 qq. Numerous algorithms have been suggested to identify specific decays, which are part of a class of jet substructure taggers. The idea behind many of these algorithms is related to event shapes in e \u00fe e \u2212 collisions. By defining N axes within a jet, it is possible to check for the compatibility of a fully merged N-prong decay. How these axes are found typically differs from algorithm to algorithm, and some techniques do not even explicitly require axes. Popular concepts are an exclusive jet clustering using the particles inside a jet as input, or the maximization of the projection of the jet constituents' momenta onto the desired number of axes, as illustrated in Fig. 2. Since the opening angle between the quarks depends on the momentum of the parent particle and its mass, larger jets (R \u223c 1) than normally employed in LHC analyses (R \u223c 0.4) are used to reconstruct boosted heavy particle decays. A larger distance parameter is chosen to capture the full kinematics of the decay already at moderate momenta of 200-400 GeV. The drawback of jets with large areas is unwanted contributions from the underlying event and from multiple proton-proton collisions in a single bunch crossing (pileup). These lead to a worsening of the resolution in quantities used to identify the substructure of jets, like the jet mass. Jet grooming and pileup removal algorithms have been developed to mitigate these effects. Grooming algorithms aim at removing soft and wide-angle radiation, therefore not only reducing the effects from the underlying event but also reducing the sensitivity to the details of fragmentation. Pileup removal algorithms are designed to identify and subtract contributions from a different interaction vertex, by eliminating uncorrelated radiation from jets. A combination of these techniques often leads to the best overall performance and it is an ongoing effort to understand the interplay of pileup removal, grooming, and tagging algorithms.",

New technologies, like silicon pixel detectors, high-resolution tracking detectors in conjunction with strong magnetic fields, highly granular calorimeters with low electronic noise, and lightweight materials for detector structures with little dead material inside the active detector volume, have enabled increasingly precise jet measurements and studies of internal jet structure. Modern particle detectors at the LHC are equipped with many layers of high-resolution tracking detectors, strong and very homogeneous magnetic fields, and finely segmented calorimeters with an excellent energy resolution. With these technologies, the ATLAS and CMS detectors 3 are equipped to track and reconstruct individual particles produced in high energy collisions. On average about 60% of a jet's momentum is carried by charged hadrons, photons account for about 25% of the total jet momentum, and the remaining 15% can be attributed to long-lived neutral hadrons (Khachatryan et al., 2017a). With increasing jet energy, the particle multiplicity increases and also the fraction of the jet's momentum carried by soft particles. For example, on average 50% of the momentum of a 50 GeV jet is carried by particles with a momentum less than 5% of the jet's momentum. It is therefore crucial to ensure that particles with energies down to O\u00f0100 MeV\u00de can be reconstructed in order to retain the full information on a jet's kinematics and internal structure.",

While charged particles can be efficiently reconstructed as tracks, neutral particles develop showers in the calorimeters and the possibility to resolve two separate showers depends on the granularity of the calorimeter and the lateral shower development. Hence, it becomes more difficult to separate two adjacent particles in dense environments, such as high-momentum jets, and the situation is aggravated by the presence of hadronic showers from charged hadrons. Often it is impossible to build one calorimeter cluster per neutral particle. A way to improve the angular resolution in jet substructure analyses is to combine measurements from the tracking detectors and calorimeters. Using combined detector measurements as input to jet algorithms, for example, using a particle-flow (PF) approach, results in improved resolutions of jet substructure observables, compared to using only tracks or only calorimeter clusters.",

While the calibration of the total jet energy scale is an important aspect in all analyses using jets, the precise knowledge of the jet mass scale and the detector response to jet substructure observables and jet tagging algorithms is specific to jet substructure analyses. Calibrating the jet energy scale results in a change of the magnitude of the jet's four-momentum, where the jet mass scale comprises an additional degree of freedom that cannot be constrained by the typical methods of balancing a jet with a well-calibrated reference object. The jet mass scale is usually calibrated using jets from fully merged, highly boosted W \u2192 qq 0 decays, facilitating a calibration of the peak position in the jet mass distribution. Measurements of the jet mass distribution from light quark and gluon jets, as well as from fully hadronic highly boosted W, Z, and t decays allow for precise tests of the modeling of perturbative and nonperturbative effects in jet production. Similar measurements can also be used to study the detector response to jet substructure observables and their modeling in simulation. A mismodeling of variables used for tagging, either in the detector simulation or on the level of the underlying physics, can result in a wrong estimation of the tagging efficiency or the misidentification rate, with important consequences for measurements. In order to overcome this limitation, measurements of tagging efficiencies and misidentification rates are performed in samples enriched with the particle decays in question. While these measurements do not help to understand the cause of the mismodeling or to improve the description of jet substructure distributions, these can be used to correct the efficiencies in simulation. It is these measurements that have enabled the use of jet substructure taggers in numerous physics analyses since the beginning of data taking at the LHC. The increased statistics from a data sample corresponding to about 150 fb \u22121 per experiment at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV can now be used to improve our understanding of the detector response to jet substructure algorithms, the underlying physics, and the performance differences of taggers. These studies and measurements represent the continuation of an exciting physics program at the LHC in a field which reached its adolescence in the past few years. In the years to come, the field of jet substructure will evolve and mature through precision measurements and the exploration of unknown territory.",

The granularity of the ATLAS ECAL in Table I refers to its second layer (as most of the electromagnetic energy is deposited there); the first layer has a finer granularity in \u03b7. The multiple layers allow for a finer granularity than the cell size in any of the individual layers, being advantageous over a laterally segmented calorimeter, and additionally provide pointing information. The difference between ATLAS and CMS for the HCAL resolution is particularly large at higher energies: a 1 TeV jet has \u03c3\u00f0E\u00de=E \u223c 2% in ATLAS, in contrast to \u03c3\u00f0E\u00de=E \u223c 5% in CMS. This is one reason why CMS fully adapted a particleflow technique since the beginning of the LHC (see Sec. III.A).",

As there is no algorithm that can simultaneously optimize all of these objectives, the various approaches trade off optimality under one metric for improvements under another. ATLAS and CMS have also developed different algorithms that cater to the experiment's hardware as well as the collaboration's goals for the tradeoffs. By default, CMS combines tracker and calorimeter information into unified particle-flow objects as inputs to jet reconstruction (CMS Collaboration, 2009a, 2010Sirunyan et al., 2017a). ATLAS has traditionally used calorimeter-only information for jet reconstruction, with tracking information used to augment or enhance the performance. While ATLAS is currently migrating to a variation of particle flow (Aaboud et al., 2017a), most of this review focuses on calorimeter-only jets as they are still the most widely used setup. ATLAS benefits less than CMS from particle flow because of its weaker magnetic field and longitudinally segmented calorimeter.",

In ATLAS, the calibration scheme relies on a classification of clusters as hadronic or electromagnetic in origin based on the energy and position of the cluster, the longitudinal depth (\u03bb clus ), and normalized signal energy density; hadronic showers tend to occur deeper in the calorimeter and be less dense (Aad et al., 2017). Charged and neutral pions are used to derive this classification and calibration, called the local cell weighting (LCW). In CMS, dedicated ECAL (based on photons) and HCAL (based on neutral kaons) calibrations are combined to account for energy and j\u03b7j-dependent nonlinearities in the hadron calorimeter response (Sirunyan et al., 2017a).

            "text": "Different strategies are used by ATLAS and CMS to reconstruct tracks from their inner detectors. ATLAS focuses first on maintaining a high efficiency with a rather inclusive first pass through inner detector hits. A second step known as ambiguity solving reduces the fake rate. In contrast, CMS uses a sequential approach with multiple passes through the remaining inner detector hits. With each pass, the efficiency increases while maintaining a low fake rate. Both procedures are effective at identifying about 90% of charged pions above 1 GeV with a percent-level (or smaller) fake rate. Lower momentum particles can be reconstructed at the cost of a higher fake rate and lower efficiency. Because of its weaker magnetic field, ATLAS is able to reach low track momentum of 100 MeV for physics analysis (Aaboud et al., 2016b), although most jet substructure measurements and searches use a threshold of 500 MeV. In contrast, the momentum resolution in CMS is excellent up to higher momenta than in ATLAS. The TRT can be used to improve the momentum resolution of high p T tracks (Aaboud et al., 2017d), but the weaker magnetic field despite a comparable inner detector radius is a fundamental limitation. I. ATLAS and CMS detectors in the barrel regions. The granularity is in pseudorapidity and azimuth (\u03b7 \u00d7 \u03d5) and d 0 is the transverse impact parameter resolution with respect to the beam line. The tracker momentum resolution is from muons while the d 0 resolution is from generic charged particles (mostly pions) in tt events. The ECAL energy resolution is presented for electrons. The granularity for the ATLAS calorimeters is for the middle layers only, which collect the largest amount of energy.

Using calibrated inputs bring the JES to within 10% of unity for E \u00bc 30 GeV and j\u03b7j < 0.3 (Aad et al., 2015b). The global sequential calibration (ATLAS Collaboration, 2015b; Aaboud et al., 2017c) was introduced for run 2 and reduces the sensitivity to differences in the responses of quark versus gluon-initiated jets (quark/gluon separation is also discussed in Sec. VI.A). This additional calibration results in a significant jet p T resolution improvement of up to 35% depending on the p T and \u03b7 of the jet (ATLAS Collaboration, 2015b). The JES uncertainty varies between 1% and 6% in the central region with \u03b7 \u00bc 0 as shown in Fig. 4 (Aaboud et al., 2017c).  In CMS, jets are clustered from calibrated particle flow objects, thus the uncalibrated JES is within 6% of the expected value of 1 for central jets with \u03b7 < 0.7 and p T > 30 GeV (Khachatryan et al., 2017a). To account for deviations from unity, factorized JES calibrations are applied in multiple stages (CMS Collaboration, 2014d) including pileup corrections, simulation-based response corrections, and small residual corrections for tracking inefficiencies and threshold effects, derived in situ from \u03b3 \u00fe jet, Z \u00fe jet, and dijet samples (CMS Collaboration, 2011b). This additional correction is not used when jet substructure observables are constructed, but dedicated corrections are derived as described in Sec. V.B. Figure 5 shows the calibrated JES uncertainty obtained in CMS, which is below 1% for jets with p T > 100 GeV in the central region with \u03b7 \u00bc 0. Even for jet p T as low as 10 GeV the uncertainty is below 3%, owing to the excellent performance of the particle flow reconstruction.",

The charged-hadron subtraction (CHS) (CMS Collaboration, 2014e) method identifies each pileup track individually. Used in concert with particle-flow concepts which attempt to identify each particle in the event uniquely, CHS can effectively remove all charged pileup radiation from the event, including calorimeter signals that are linked to tracks through the particle-flow algorithm. Identification of pileup jets, formed predominantly from the energy of one or many pileup vertices, is another technique for removing pileup using charged particles; by determining the fraction of energy of the jet from the primary vertex, one can distinguish such pileup jets from the PV jets (CMS Collaboration, 2013a; Aad et al., 2016d). The two methods discussed can be combined. First the more precise CHS method subtracts the pileup contribution from charged particles.

Topoclustering (Aad et al., 2017), used by the ATLAS Collaboration, is deployed at the formation of clusters in the calorimeter requiring radiation to have a certain topological profile.

            "text": "While the previous methods have been successfully deployed in the LHC experiments, they each have some deficiencies as well. Ideally, one wants to effectively combine all pileup mitigation handles in order to maximally distinguish pileup from PV radiation and to remove pileup at the most granular level possible, i.e., at the particle or constituent level, in order to be as generic as possible. For example, while area subtraction is effective for correcting the jet p T , it is not used to mitigate the pileup dependence of jet substructure observables as it is only able to correctly remove pileup contributions on average. In fact, jet substructure variables are among the most difficult to correct for pileup because they are so reliant on radiation profiles. A number of hybrid methods have been proposed operating at the event constituent level. One example is the Pileup Per Particle Identification (PUPPI)  algorithm which is extensively used in CMS. The PUPPI algorithm uses both event energy density and local topological information incorporated in an event-by-event particle-level discriminator to determine if a particle is from pileup. The algorithm defines a shape which attempts to distinguish parton showerlike radiation from pileuplike radiation. The shape is calculated from p T , the angular distance to nearby particles, and other information. Particle four-vectors are then weighted proportional to the value of the discriminator value. Ideally, particles from the hard scatter would get a weight of 1 and pileup particles would get a weight of 0. Almost all pileup particles have values within a few standard deviations of the median and are assigned small weights. Values that deviate far from the charged pileup are indicative of a hard scatter, and these particles are assigned large weights. This weighting method allows for experimental information, such as tracking, vertexing, and timing information, to be included.",

For trimming, the k T algorithm is used to recluster and the radius parameter of the reclustering is called R sub . Those smaller-radius jets with a momentum fraction f < f cut are removed to produce the trimmed jet. The two other algorithms impose a condition on each 2 \u2192 1 clustering step, by going backward in the sequence in which the particles were combined in the reclustering. The transverse momentum fraction of the softer particle to the merged system z \u00bc min\u00f0p T;1 ; p T;2 \u00de=\u00f0p T;1 \u00fe p T;2 \u00de is a natural choice for determining the scale of the soft radiation, and the angular distance \u0394R between the two particles for identifying wide-angle radiation. The difference between pruning and soft drop lies in the way how particles and their combinations get rejected based on the values of z and \u0394R. For pruning, the softer particle of the 2 \u2192 1 clustering step is discarded if z < z p and \u0394R < d p . For soft drop, the softer particle is discarded if z < z cut \u00f0\u0394R=R\u00de \u03b2 , where z cut and the angular exponent \u03b2 are free parameters. 6 The role of grooming has traditionally satisfied two purposes in ATLAS, being the mitigation of pileup effects on jets, and the removal of soft or wide-angle radiation. The particle flow algorithm employed in CMS in conjunction with CHS or PUPPI allows for a correction for pileup effects. This reduces the usefulness of grooming for pileup mitigation, but retains its advantage for the removal of soft or wide-angle radiation.",

            "text": "ATLAS performed a broad study of the relative performance of different grooming techniques for boson-tagging (ATLAS Collaboration, 2015c, 2017b; Aad et al., 2016e), toptagging (ATLAS Collaboration, 2015d; Aad et al., 2016k), and SM measurements (Aad et al., 2014d; Aaboud et al., 2018c), using the removal of pileup dependence, the jet mass resolution, and the tagging efficiency versus background rejection as performance metrics. The \"standard\" grooming procedure adopted by ATLAS is trimming with f cut \u00bc 0.05 for boson tagging in both run 1 (R sub \u00bc 0.3) and run 2 (R sub \u00bc 0.2). The trimming algorithm with the same parameters was adopted for top tagging, along with several other techniques (see Sec. VI.C). Another technique currently in use by ATLAS is the reclustering of small-R jets (Nachman et al., 2015), which uses fully calibrated anti-k T , R \u00bc 0.4 jets as inputs to the anti-k T algorithm with a larger distance parameter (typically R \u00bc 1.0). This has proven a popular method in ATLAS analyses due to the flexibility of optimizing the jet distance parameter depending on the considered phase space of the analysis (Aad et al., 2016g;Aaboud et al., 2016c. A recent study of in situ measurements (ATLAS Collaboration, 2017d) (including \"close-by\" effects) confirms that the differences between data and simulation observed with reclustered jets are indeed covered by simply  propagating the uncertainties associated with the input anti-k T , R \u00bc 0.4 jets. CMS studied a large number of grooming techniques in the context of boosted boson-tagging (CMS Collaboration, 2014b; Khachatryan et al., 2014a), top-tagging (CMS Collaboration, 2014f, 2016a), and SM measurements (Chatrchyan et al., 2013b;Sirunyan et al., 2018o). During run 1 the grooming techniques were used together with chargedhadron subtraction for pileup mitigation (see Sec. IV). All groomers studied showed reasonable or good agreement between data and simulation and the pruning algorithm (R \u00bc 0.8, z p \u00bc 0.1, and d p \u00bc 0.5) showed the best performance for boson tagging (Khachatryan et al., 2014a). For run 2, soft drop (z cut \u00bc 0.1 and \u03b2 \u00bc 0) is used for jets with R \u00bc 0.8 in jet substructure analyses in CMS together with the pileup removal algorithm PUPPI ) (see Sec. IV). Soft drop jets in combination with PUPPI show a similar performance as pruning when comparing signal efficiency versus background rejection (CMS Collaboration, 2016a, 2017a), but allow for better theoretical control. While grooming techniques were found to improve the performance (higher background rejection at fixed signal efficiency) of the jet mass, N-subjettiness ratios Van Tilburg, 2011, 2012) were found to perform better without grooming for boosted boson tagging (Khachatryan et al., 2014a). For top-tagging applications, however, soft drop groomed N-subjettiness ratios improved the performance with respect to ungroomed ones for jets with p T < 400 GeV. For higher p T jets there was no significant gain observed with grooming for N-subjettiness ratios (CMS Collaboration, 2016a).",

Remarkably, the resolution obtained in CMS is comparable to the one for the combined mass in ATLAS ( Fig. 11), even though quark/gluon jets are compared with W=Z jets and very different technologies are used to reconstruct the jet mass.",

The discriminants are constructed from variables sensitive to the radiation pattern of quark and gluon jets, also taking into account differences between light (uds) and heavy flavor (cb) quark jets, where the latter are more similar to gluon jets. ATLAS uses the number of tracks n trk as an approximation for the number of jet constituents and the jet width (ATLAS Collaboration, 2017i) while CMS utilizes the number of particle flow constituents n const , the jet axes, and fragmentation functions (CMS Collaboration, 2017a). Since the distributions of these variables depend on \u03b7, p T , and \u03c1, the likelihood discriminators are constructed differentially with respect to these variables. In run 2, ATLAS also introduced a simple and robust tagger using solely n track (ATLAS Collaboration, 2017g), which has the advantage of a much-simplified uncertainty derivation.  Figure 18 shows the CMS q=g tagging performance in simulation. The q=g label is obtained through a matching of jets on the detector level to outgoing partons from the matrixelement calculation. For a 50% gluon/quark efficiency, the misidentification rate (quark or gluon) is about 10%. This performance depends slightly on the jet p T , in part because the particle multiplicity increases with p T (and therefore the performance improves). Outside the tracking acceptance (j\u03b7j \u2273 2.5), q=g tagging significantly degrades due to the coarse calorimeter granularity and increased pileup sensitivity.",

After applying a simulation-based correction to eliminate this inclusive bias in the JES, a residual calibration is applied to correct for the dependence of the bias on the number of tracks associated with the jet and the jet width (ATLAS Collaboration, 2015b). After applying this residual GSC, the difference in response between quark and gluon jets is reduced.

A commonly used method is the extrapolation from one or more control regions, which are defined orthogonally to the signal region. Usually, these control regions are defined by inverting the jet mass window selection (Khachatryan et al., 2014bSirunyan et al., 2017g;Aaboud et al., 2017g, 2018g;ATLAS Collaboration, 2017k). Transfer functions are derived from simulation, extrapolating the rates and shapes from the control to the signal regions. Even though these transfer functions are ratios of distributions, which results in a reduction of the impact of modeling uncertainties, a residual dependence on the simulation cannot be eliminated. However, additional uncertainties in the high-p T tails of the transfer functions can be eliminated by ensuring a constant behavior as a function of p T . The requirement is thus a flat signal or background efficiency (depending on the needs of the analysis). In order to achieve a flat signal efficiency, ATLAS developed a p T -dependent selection on the value of D \u03b2\u00bc1",

An attempt was made by CMS to discriminate \"resolved\" (nonmerged) hadronic W decays from multijet background using the QGL, the sum of the jet charges of the dijet pair, and the jet pull angle. Combining these variables into a boosted decision tree, a misidentification rate of about 25% is achieved for a signal efficiency of 50% (CMS Collaboration, 2014b).

While theoretically clean due to the color singlet nature of the W and Z bosons, this task is particularly challenging because the jet mass resolution is comparable to the difference m Z \u2212 m W . In order to improve the sensitivity of the tagger, jet charge and b tagging information are combined with the jet mass. The jet mass  distribution depends on the type of W or Z decay due to semileptonic B and D decays, so a full likelihood tagger is constructed by summing over the conditional likelihoods for each flavor type. To maximize the discrimination power from b tagging, multiple efficiency working points are used simultaneously in the tagger. Figure 24 illustrates the performance of the boson type tagger in simulation. A W \u00fe rejection near 8 (corresponding to a misidentification rate of 12.5%) is achieved at a Z boson efficiency of 50%. At this moderate Z boson efficiency, all of the inputs offer useful discrimination information. At low efficiencies, below the bb branching ratio for Z bosons, b tagging dominates over the jet mass and jet charge. The boson type tagger was optimized for a relatively low boson boost 200 < p T < 400 GeV. The discrimination power of all of the input variables degrades with p T due to the worsening jet mass resolution, tracking efficiency, and momentum resolution, as well as b tagging efficiency. However, there are recent developments to address each of these challenges, such as the track-assisted jet mass (see Sec. V.B), pixel-cluster splitting (ATLAS Collaboration, 2014a), and track-jet b tagging (ATLAS Collaboration, 2014b).",

(c) Shower deconstruction Spannowsky, 2011, 2013) was designed to be analogous to running a parton shower Monte Carlo generator in reverse, where emission and decay probabilities at each vertex, color connections, and kinematic requirements are considered. Small-radius (generally R \u00bc 0.2) subjets are reconstructed with the CA algorithm and all possible shower histories that can lead to the observed leading final state anti-k T , R \u00bc 1.0 jet are calculated. Each shower history is assigned a probability weight factor based on the aforementioned considerations (to be signal-like or backgroundlike), then a likelihood ratio \u03c7\u00f0p N \u00de is constructed, and the log \u03c7\u00f0p N \u00de is used as the discriminating substructure variable.

The efficiency increases with increasing jet p T , where a plateau is reached for p T > 2000 GeV, with efficiencies of \u223c80% at 10% misidentification rate. Recently, the shower deconstruction algorithm was optimized for top quarks with p T > 800 GeV in context of the W 0 to tb hadronic search (Aaboud et al., 2018d) by using exclusive k T subjets. In addition to the dedicated techniques previously described, simpler algorithms using grooming and substructure similar to V tagging methods have been investigated by ATLAS. A performance study at 7 TeV (Aad et al., 2013e) investigated a variety of performance metrics relating to the usage of groomed jets. Different grooming algorithms were investigated for their resilience to pileup and mass resolution. It was concluded that trimmed anti-k T jets with a distance parameter of 1.0 and trimming parameters of R sub \u00bc 0.3 and f cut \u00bc 0.05 were a good candidate for a one-fits-all large-R jet definition. This jet definition became standard in ATLAS for W, Z, or H and top quark tagging in run 1. A later ATLAS study (Aad et al., 2016k)   (Butterworth, Cox, and Forshaw, 2002). The efficiency versus rejection is shown for various taggers in Fig. 25. The difference between taggers III and V is the additional requirement on ffiffiffiffiffiffi ffi d 23 p in tagger V. At efficiencies smaller than 45%, the W 0 tagger, based on ffiffiffiffiffiffi ffi d 12 p and the N-subjettiness ratios \u03c4 21 and \u03c4 32 , has better background rejection than taggers III and V. ATLAS also tested the HTT and shower deconstruction (ATLAS Collaboration, 2017l), which have been found to have good background rejection (larger than 50) for efficiency values smaller than about 35%. However, similar to the CMS experiment, the background efficiencies of the two taggers show a significant rise with increasing p T .",

Figure 26 shows a comparison based on simulation of the single variable performance in CMS, where signal jets are generated through a heavy resonance decaying to tt and background jets are taken from QCD multijet production. Note that for this study reconstructed jets are matched to a generated parton, and the distance between the top quark and its decay products must be less than 0.6 (0.8) for a reconstructed R \u00bc 0.8 (1.5) jet, to ensure that the top quark decay products are fully merged and reconstructed in a single jet. The best single variable in terms of efficiency versus background rejection is the discriminator log \u03c7, calculated with shower deconstruction. The second best variables are the N-subjettiness ratio \u03c4 32 at low efficiency and the jet mass calculated with the HTTv2 at high efficiency values. The individual groomed jet masses show similar performance, and the CMS Collaboration moved to using the soft drop mass due to its beneficial theoretical properties (Larkoski, Moult, and Nachman, 2017). The default for CMS run 2 analyses was chosen to be the soft drop jet mass combined with \u03c4 32 for top tagging at high p T .

            "text": "A common problem of top-tagging algorithms is the rise of the misidentification rate with increasing p T , which is due to the peak of the mass distribution for quark-and gluon-initiated background jets shifting to higher values. For some taggers, for example the CMSTT, this shift also results in a decrease of the efficiency once a high p T threshold is crossed (larger than 1 TeV) (CMS Collaboration, 2011a). A possible solution to this is offered by the variable-R (VR) algorithm, introduced in Sec. VI.B. The ATLAS Collaboration studied the performance of the VR algorithm for top tagging and reported a stabilization of the position of the jet mass peak for a large range of p T (ATLAS Collaboration, 2016g). The VR jets are shown to improve the performance of the jet mass, ffiffiffiffiffiffi ffi d 12 p and \u03c4 32 for top tagging, when compared to trimmed jets. An interesting development using VR jets is the heavy object tagger with variable R (Lapsien, Kogler, and Haller, 2016), which combines the VR algorithm with a clustering veto, resulting in a single jet clustering sequence producing groomed jets with subjets.",

A search for resonances decaying to tt by the ATLAS Collaboration uses a cascading selection from boosted to resolved (Aad et al., 2015g), where the resolved topology is reconstructed and identified using a \u03c7 2 -sorting algorithm. To efficiently identify top quarks over a broad p T range in the search for top squark pair production, reclustered variable-R jets are used with R \u00bc 0.4 jets as inputs to the jet reclustering algorithm (Aaboud et al., 2016c, 2018j).",

            "text": "A search for supersymmetry in CMS (CMS Collaboration, 2017d) uses three distinct topologies: fully merged top quark decays (monojet), merged W boson decays (dijet), and resolved decays (trijet). The efficiency of the three categories is shown in Fig. 28, where the turn-on of the combined efficiency starts at values as low as p T \u2248 100 GeV. The resolved trijet category is identified using three anti-k T jets   with a distance parameter of 0.4, where the large combinatorial background is suppressed through a multivariate analysis, which achieves a misidentification rate of approximately 20%. There exist other approaches to cover the transition from low to high Lorentz boosts, using a single algorithm. In the HTTv2 algorithm, the jet size is reduced until an optimal size R opt is found, defined by the fractional jet mass contained in the smaller jet. This results in better performance at high p T , while keeping a low misidentification rate at low p T . An important step toward the commissioning of top taggers within an experiment is measurements of the efficiency and misidentification rate in real collision data. Generally, highpurity samples of top jets in data are obtained using a tight signal selection (an electron or muon, well separated from a high-p T large-R jet, and an additional b-tagged jet) to ensure that events contain a fully merged top quark decay in a single large-R jet. This can never be fully achieved, as no requirements on the substructure of the large-R jet can be imposed without biasing the efficiency measurement. This results in an efficiency measurement that will be based on a sample also containing partially merged or even nonmerged top quark decays. These can be subtracted from the efficiency measurement by using simulated events, as done in a study by the ATLAS Collaboration (Aad et al., 2016k), with the drawback of relying on a specific simulation and the ambiguous definition of a fully merged top quark decay. By not correcting for nonmerged top quark decays, efficiency values are obtained smaller than the ones suggested by ROC curve studies; see, for example, CMS Collaboration (2016a). Instead of subtracting the top backgrounds, the CMS Collaboration performed a simultaneous extraction of the efficiencies for fully and partially merged categories (CMS Collaboration, 2017b).",

The disadvantage of this approach is the high p T threshold of unprescaled jet triggers, which results in measurements starting from p T > 400 GeV or higher. A solution to this is the tag-and-probe method, in which the tagged jet can be required to fail top-tagging selection criteria, resulting in a sample with negligible contamination of tt production, even after requiring the probe jet to be top tagged (CMS Collaboration, 2016a). Another approach is to use a nonisolated electron trigger, where the electron fails off-line identification criteria. This yields events mainly from lightflavor multijet production, where a jet is misidentified as an electron at the trigger level. While the top-tag misidentification rate can be measured starting from smaller values of p T with this strategy, a non-negligible amount of tt contamination has to be subtracted after requiring a top-tagged jet (Aad et al., 2016k).",

Other jet substructure observables can improve performance, but are often less powerful once two b tagged jets or subjets are required 400 450 (as this necessarily forces the jet to have two prongs). The lighter mass of the Higgs boson compared with the top quark also means that the b jets from the H decay become merged at a lower parent particle boost. The boosted H \u2192 bb signature is present in many models of physics beyond the standard model: resonant HH and VH production, searches for boosted mono-H, or vectorlike quark searches in the tH and bH final states. Because of the large predicted branching fraction for the H \u2192 bb decay of about 58%, its coupling to b quarks is one of the most interesting to study. For a large fraction of Higgs bosons with p T > 300 GeV, the two b quark jets merge into a single jet for a jet distance parameter of R \u00bc 0.8 or 1.0, as used in CMS and ATLAS, respectively.

Tagging b jets in dense environments is of particular importance here and was studied by ATLAS (ATLAS Collaboration, 2014c). In CMS subjets with R \u00bc 0.4 are clustered with the k T algorithm using the constituents of the large-R jet, while for ATLAS track jets with a radius of 0.2 are matched to the large-R jet using the ghost-association technique. At high p T the subjets start to overlap causing the standard b tagging techniques to break down due to double counting of tracks and secondary vertices when computing the subjet b tag discriminants. (b) Double-b tagging (CMS Collaboration, 2016e; AT-LAS Collaboration, 2016k; Sirunyan et al., 2018c), where in ATLAS the term double-b tagging means that the two leading p T track jets must pass the same b tagging requirement. In CMS, the double-b tagger (CMS Collaboration, 2016e; Sirunyan et al., 2018c) uses the N-subjettiness axes and the pruned anti-k T , R \u00bc 0.8 jet mass with a window of 50 < M < 200 GeV to reduce the multijet background. The Higgs-jet efficiency versus the inclusive multijet rejection is shown in Fig. 30 for ATLAS subjet b tagging, where the performance curves are shown for double-b tagging, leading subjet b tagging, and asymmetric b tagging 11 requirements. None of the curves reach a Higgs-jet efficiency of 100% due to the imperfect efficiency to reconstruct the track jets needed for b tagging and, in the case of asymmetric b tagging, also due to the 70% b tagging working point requirement on one of the track jets.",

The cross section for both groomed and ungroomed CA R \u00bc 1.2 jets was measured separately to gain sensitivity to both the hard and soft jet physics and to gain a deeper understanding of the various effects involved in QCD radiation. For the ungroomed jet mass, large discrepancies were observed in the tails of the mass distribution between the predictions from the MC event generators PYTHIA and HERWIG++ and the data, whereas the core of the mass distribution agreed within approximately 20% over the considered p T range. The largest discrepancies occur at low jet masses which are sensitive to the underlying event description, hadronization model, and pileup effects. The normalized cross section after applying the split filtering algorithm (Butterworth et al., 2008) is shown in Fig. 32 with the mass drop parameters \u03bc frac \u00bc 0.67 and y filt \u00bc 0.09, and a filtering parameter of R filt \u00bc min\u00f00.3; \u0394R=2\u00de. After removing soft radiation from the jet which is difficult to model, the MC prediction is in excellent agreement with the data within statistical precision. The CMS Collaboration performed a similar measurement with anti-k T R \u00bc 0.7 jets using various grooming techniques in selected dijet events using 5 fb \u22121 of ffiffi ffi s p \u00bc 7 TeV data and found as well that the agreement between data and the MC prediction improves significantly after grooming techniques are applied (Chatrchyan et al., 2013b). Furthermore, a measurement of the cross section was performed in V \u00fe jet final states which overall show a slightly better data or MC agreement than that observed in dijet events suggesting that the simulation of quark jets is better than for gluon jets.",

The soft drop algorithm was chosen as it allows one to compare the unfolded measurement directly to theoretical calculations which exceed the precision of parton shower MC simulations. The jet energies of the ungroomed jets used in the ATLAS measurement are corrected for pileup effects and calibrated to the generator level while no explicit mass calibration is applied to the groomed jets as the unfolding procedure accounts for differences between the reconstructed and generator-level masses. The CMS Collaboration applied calibration factors derived from simulation and using in situ techniques (from boosted W bosons) to correct the jet energy and mass scale. Furthermore, the jet energy and mass are smeared in MC simulation to match the resolution measurements in data. Various sources of systematic uncertainties, categorized as experimental and theoretical uncertainties, that impact the jet mass measurement are taken into account. While CMS evaluated the effect of the jet energy and mass scale uncertainties on the measurement by varying the energy and mass by their respective uncertainties, ATLAS evaluated the experimental uncertainties based on the accuracy of the modeling of the topological cluster energies and positions as well as their reconstruction efficiency. Theoretical uncertainties on the physics model are taken into account by comparing the response matrix for various MC generators.

For higher jet masses, where fixed-order effects play an important role, the NLO \u00fe NLL calculation provides a better description than the LO \u00fe NNLL calculation. In addition to generic QCD jets, the jet mass has also been measured for boosted top quarks in lepton \u00fe jets tt events collected by the CMS Collaboration at 8 TeV (Sirunyan et al., 2017e). This measurement is the first jet mass distribution unfolded at the particle level probing three prong decays. Large-R jets are reconstructed with the CA algorithm using a distance parameter of 1.2. The larger value of R in this measurement compared to the default R \u00bc 0.8 applied for toptagging applications in CMS is due to an optimization of statistical precision versus the width of the jet mass distribution at the particle level and the JMR. The number of fully merged top quarks grows with increasing R, but so does the width of the jet mass distribution and the susceptibility to pileup and the underlying event. The leading jet p T is required to be above 400 GeV to ensure the hadronic top quark decay to be fully captured within the large-R jet. No substructure selection is applied on the high-p T large-R jet in order not to bias the jet mass measurement. A requirement of p T > 150 GeV is imposed on the subleading jet to select the b quark from the leptonically decaying top quark. A veto on additional jets with p T > 150 GeV is applied, which results in a fraction of 65% of fully merged top quark decays within the large-R jet. The particle-level differential tt cross section as a function of the leading jet mass is shown in Fig. 35. The simulations shown predict a larger cross section than observed in the measurement, consistent with the tt cross section measurements from the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations at high p T . The shape of the jet mass distribution is well described by the simulations. The experimental systematic uncertainties are dominated by the uncertainties on the jet mass and energy scale, but are smaller than the uncertainties due to the signal modeling, coming from the choice of the top quark mass, the parton showering, and the choice of the factorization and renormalization scales.",

The ATLAS (CMS) Collaboration measured the jet charge for different values of \u03ba using anti-k T jets with a radius parameter of R \u00bc 0.4 (R \u00bc 0.5) in a sample of dijet events. The ATLAS Collaboration distinguishes between the two leading jets using the pseudorapidity instead of the p T to avoid cases where the leading particle-level jet is reconstructed as the subleading detector-level jet due to the jet energy resolution and to gain sensitivity to different jet flavors. The average jet charge at detector and particle levels for the more forward of the leading jets and for \u03ba \u00bc 0.5 is shown in Fig. 37. Because of the increasing fraction of scattering valence up quark jets (up quark charge > 0), the average jet charge increases with p T . The difference of the average jet charge distribution at the detector level and the particle level in Fig. 37 shows that the unfolding corrections are large and growing at high p T , due to the loss of charged-particle tracks inside jets as a result of track merging. The average jet charge as predicted by PYTHIA8 (Sjostrand, Mrenna, and Skands, 2008) using the Perugia tunes (Skands, 2010) is smaller than that observed in data due to a well-known overestimation of the multiplicity inside jets. The dominating systematic uncertainties are the track p T resolution and the choice of MC generator used to construct the response matrix (PYTHIA6 versus HERWIG++) for the CMS Collaboration whereas the uncertainties on the unfolding procedure, the jet energy resolution at low p T , and uncertainties on the tracking at high p T dominate the measurement of the ATLAS Collaboration. The unfolded jet charge distribution (\u03ba \u00bc 0.6) of the leading jet in data is compared to the prediction from POWHEG + PYTHIA8 (PH + P8) and POWHEG + HERWIG++ (PH + HPP) in Fig. 38. The different hadronization and fragmentation models used by PYTHIA8 and HERWIG++ have the largest impact on the jet charge distribution. Variations of the jet charge can also be observed for different PDF sets; however, the effect of the relative flavor fraction in the dijet samples is significantly smaller than the choice of the showering and fragmentation models. It was further found that the predicted jet charge distribution has a significant dependence on the chosen value of \u03b1 s that describes final state radiation whereas it is insensitive to the NLO QCD effect in the matrix element calculation, colorreconnection, and multiple parton interactions. These findings are consistent between the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations. In addition to studying the sensitivity to various nonperturbative aspects of hadronization and parton distribution functions, the jet charge measurement by ATLAS includes the first direct comparison of a jet substructure quantity with a perturbative calculation at the LHC. As it is not collinear safe, the average jet charge is not calculable. However, the p T dependence for a particular jet type has been calculated (Waalewijn, 2012;Krohn et al., 2013). A new technique was introduced by Aad et al. (2016h) to separately extract the average up and down quark jet charges. For a fixed p T , the more forward of the two dijets has a higher energy and is therefore more likely to be the scattering parton with a higher momentum fraction of the proton. In turn, the higher momentum fraction parton is most likely to be a valence quark. Therefore, the fraction of up quark jets is higher for the more forward dijet than the more central dijet. Assuming further that the jet charge is entirely determined by the jet p T and parton origin, one can then solve a system of equations to extract the average up and down quark jet charges in each bin of jet p T :",

The fiducial region is such that events with top p T below 100 GeV and above 600 GeV are underrepresented, with the former caused by trigger and reconstruction efficiencies and the latter by collimated decays from large Lorentz boosts. This is evident from Fig. 40, where a drop in selection efficiency below 100 GeV and above 600 GeV is apparent. This results in a small number of events being selected with high top quark p T , as seen in the ATLAS run 1 (7 TeV) measurement shown in Fig. 41. This means that an interesting region in terms of new physics is the least well measured. Despite often having similar signal efficiencies to resolved reconstructed techniques, boosted top-tagging techniques allow for more precise measurements at high p T due to their higher background rejection.",

The measurement extends to p T of 1.5 TeV and a similar trend as at 8 TeV is observed between the data and the simulation at high p T . A newer measurement of the tt differential cross section in the all-hadronic channel was performed by the ATLAS Collaboration with 36.1 fb \u22121 of 13 TeV data (Aaboud et al., 2018m). The measurement used trimmed anti-k T R \u00bc 1.0 jets with R sub \u00bc 0.2 and f cut \u00bc 0.05. To obtain a flat signal efficiency of 50% and a quark/gluon rejection of approximately 17 (10) for p T \u00bc 500 \u00f01000\u00de GeV, p T dependent criteria are applied on the jet mass and \u03c4 32 . Furthermore the two top-tagged large-R jets are required to have a b tagged small-R jet within \u0394R < 1.0. The event selection results in a signal-to-background ratio of approximately 3\u22361. The measured fiducial phase-space cross section is \u03c3 \u00bc 292 AE 7\u00f0stat\u00de AE 76\u00f0syst\u00de compared to the POWHEG + PYTHIA8 prediction of 384 AE 36 fb at NNLO \u00fe NNLL. The measured normalized differential cross section as a function of the top jet p T and rapidity is in good agreement with the different MC predictions. Larger discrepancies are observed for the p T of the tt system as shown in Fig. 44. The measurement is dominated by the systematic uncertainties on the jet energy, mass, and substructure scale of the large-R  Khachatryan et al., 2016g. jets, alternative parton shower model, and the uncertainties on the b jet identification.",

The W and Z signals are enhanced over the dominating QCD background by constructing a likelihood discriminant from three substructure variables, thrust minor (Brandt et al., 1964;Farhi, 1977), sphericity (Bjorken and Brodsky, 1970), and aplanarity (Bjorken and Brodsky, 1970), resulting in a signal efficiency of 56% and a background rejection of 89%. The jet mass distribution after subtracting the expected background from tt events is shown in Fig. 45. A binned maximum likelihood fit to the jet mass distribution is used to extract the W and Z jet signal yield and to calculate the inclusive cross section. Only the combined W \u00fe Z cross section measurement is performed in this analysis due to the limited jet mass resolution. The combined W \u00fe Z cross section is measured to be \u03c3 W\u00feZ \u00bc 8.5 AE 0.8\u00f0stat\u00de AE 1.5\u00f0syst\u00de pb and is in agreement with the standard model prediction of \u03c3 W\u00feZ \u00bc 5.1 AE 0.5 pb within 2 standard deviations. The dominating systematic uncertainties are the jet mass resolution and the choice of the QCD background PDF. The signal significance was furthermore studied when using groomed jets instead of ungroomed jets. Without an optimization of the analysis for groomed jets, similar significances were observed for groomed and ungroomed jets as expected due to the low number of pileup vertices in the 7 TeV dataset.",

            "text": "As discussed in Sec. VI.D the SM Higgs boson decays with approximately 58% into bb. However, the H \u2192 bb decay in the resolved channel can be studied only in associated production with either a vector boson (W or Z) (Aaboud et al., 2017l; Sirunyan et al., 2018k), top quarks, or via the vector-boson-fusion production mechanism due to the overwhelming multijet background. To search for H \u2192 bb in the gluon-gluon fusion production mode with an additional high-p T jet, jet substructure techniques can be employed to suppress the enormous multijet background. The CMS Collaboration performed a search for the SM Higgs boson using a dijet topology with 35.9 fb \u22121 of 13 TeV pp collisions (Sirunyan et al., 2018l). The analysis used anti-k T R \u00bc 0.8 jets corrected with the PUPPI algorithm to reduce the effects from pileup, and modified with the soft drop algorithm (\u03b2 \u00bc 0, z cut \u00bc 0.1) to mitigate the effects from the underlying event and soft or wide-angle radiation. At least one large-R jet with p T > 450 GeV and j\u03b7j < 2.5 is required. To distinguish the two prong structure of a jet containing the full H \u2192 bb decay from quark-or gluon-initiated jets, the N 1 2 variable, calculated from the generalized energy correlation functions, is exploited. To ensure a flat QCD background rejection of 26% over the considered mass and p T range, a decorrelation procedure (Dolen et al., 2016) is applied to N 1 2 . The multijet background is further suppressed by utilizing the double-b tagger. The W=Z \u00fe jets background is estimated from MC simulation and the shape of the multijet background is determined in a validation region in data with lower values of the double-b tagger discriminator. The soft drop mass distribution of the leading jet is shown in Fig. 46 with a clear resonant structure at the mass of the W and Z bosons. The SM background processes and the potential signal from SM H \u2192 bb production are estimated simultaneously. The observed (expected) significance for the H \u2192 bb process is 1.5 (0.7)\u03c3. The measured cross section for the Z \u00fe jets process is 0.85 AE 0.16\u00f0stat\u00de \u00fe1.0 \u22120.4 \u00f0syst\u00de pb which is in agreement with the SM prediction of 1.09 AE 0.11 pb. This is the first observation of Z \u2192 bb in the single jet topology.",

The jet is considered to be a W boson candidate if the mass is in the range 65-85 GeV, while it is a Z boson candidate if the mass is in the range 85-105 GeV. This leads to the three signal categories WW, ZZ, and WZ. The jets are further categorized according to \u03c4 21 into high purity (HP, \u03c4 21 < 0.35) and low purity (LP, 0.35 < \u03c4 21 < 0.75). Events are always required to have one HP V jet, and are divided into HP and LP events, depending on whether the other V jet is of high or low purity.

Therefore, the usual lepton-isolation criteria, which are used to mitigate the contamination with QCD multijet background, are relaxed. The CMS and ATLAS Collaborations follow different strategies for this purpose. In CMS (Khachatryan et al., 2016k;Sirunyan et al., 2017i), the lepton must have a large angular separation from the associated b jet candidate of \u0394R\u00f0lepton; jet\u00de > 0.5 or it must have a transverse momentum relative to the jet axis p rel T above 25 GeV. This requirement removes background contributions from semileptonic B hadron decays. In ATLAS (Aad et al., 2015g;Aaboud et al., 2018n), the lepton isolation is achieved by a variable isolation cone that changes as a function of the transverse momentum (Rehermann and Tweedie, 2011). Interestingly, studies performed in CMS for 13 TeV show that the CMS implementation of such a variable isolation criterion is not as powerful as the selection based on \u0394R\u00f0lepton; jet\u00de and p rel T (CMS Collaboration, 2016c).",

In CMS (ATLAS) the large-R jet is reconstructed with the CA (anti-k T ) algorithm with a size parameter of R \u00bc 0.8 (1.0). The selection requirement on the transverse momentum is p T > 400 \u00f0300\u00de GeV. ATLAS applies trimming to the large-R jets with the parameters f cut \u00bc 0.05 and R sub \u00bc 0.3 and the jets are required to have a mass m jet > 100 GeV and ffiffiffiffiffiffi ffi d 12 p > 40 GeV. The strategy followed by CMS is to apply the CMSTT algorithm (as defined in Sec. VI.C), where the mass of the jet has to satisfy 140 < m jet < 250 GeV. In addition, the N-subjettiness ratio \u03c4 32 must be smaller than 0.7.  The variable of interest is the invariant mass m tt of the tt system. It is reconstructed from the top-tagged large-R jet, a b tagged small-R jet, as well as the lepton and the missing energy. Once the top-pair system is reconstructed, events are further divided into categories based on the lepton flavor and the number of b-tagged and top-tagged jets. This gives several analysis categories with different background compositions: the top-tagged and b-tagged events are dominated by the SM tt background, while events without top tags and b tags are mostly composed of W \u00fe jets events.",

The opposite jet is then used to measure the misidentification rate for the top-tagging requirements. The measured misidentification rate ranges from 5% to 10%, depending on the jet momentum, \u03c4 32 , and the b tagging requirements applied. This differential rate is used in a sample of single top-tagged events to predict the double top-tagged event contribution from QCD processes in each individual event category. Closure tests performed in data and simulation are performed to validate the background estimation for each of the signal regions. No significant excess above the predicted background is observed in the measured tt invariant mass spectrum. Figure 49 shows the m tt spectrum in the analysis category with the highest S=B fraction.

The single production modes may have higher cross sections than pair production depending on the VLQ mass and the coupling parameters (Aguilar-Saavedra et al., 2013). ATLAS performed an analysis (Aad et al., 2016j) where the VLQ is searched for in the decay mode with a W boson and a top quark (B \u2192 tW). Final states with at least one lepton are considered, where either the W boson or the top quark appear in a boosted configuration. They are identified by the application of a jet mass requirement (m > 50 GeV) on a trimmed large-R anti-k T jet with a distance parameter R \u00bc 1.0. A different strategy is followed in another ATLAS search (Aad et al., 2016b), where the decay into the bW final state is investigated (T=Y \u2192 bW). As the W boson is assumed to decay leptonically, no boosted hadronic W or top quark decays are present. Therefore, the analysis uses a veto on the presence of massive (m > 70 GeV), trimmed large-R anti-k T jets with R \u00bc 1.0, to suppress the dominant tt background.",

When the new particle (such as a Z 0 ) is sufficiently light (m Z 0 \u226a 1 TeV), it can be boosted when produced in association with initial-state radiation and thus entirely captured by a single large-radius jet (Sirunyan et al., 2018p;Aaboud et al., 2019b). Searching in this mode can significantly extend the sensitivity of the existing search program, where resolved low-mass resonance searches typically degrade due to high trigger thresholds and the enormous QCD multijet background.",
