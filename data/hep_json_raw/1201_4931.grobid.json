One of the key remaining questions is the origin of the masses of elementary particles attributed to the spontaneous breaking of electroweak symmetry. The existence of the associated field quantum, the Higgs boson (H), has still to be experimentally established. The discovery or exclusion of the SM Higgs boson is one of the central goals of the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) physics program.",

A full description of the detector as well as of the physics objects and technical challenges to trigger interesting events and extract physics signal from the high luminosity scenario can be found in [1]. The analysis covers a wide mass range hypothesis for the Higgs mass, from 110 GeV/c 2 to 600 GeV/c 2 . The main challenge of the search analysis is to distinguish the candidate signal from a wide set of backgrounds showing the very same final states but much higher cross sections. Beside to reducible backgrounds such as Z/W+jets, tt, single top, QCD hard scattering where jets are misidentified as leptons, we have to deal also with irreducible backgrounds from WW and ZZ production.",

Given the large E miss T , a mass peak cannot be reconstructed and therefore the analysis has a reduced Higgs mass resolution. The zero spin of the Higgs boson gives angular constraints to the final state: the two leptons are expected with moderately small opening angle while the E miss T with large angle with respect to the a e-mail: giuseppe.codispoti@cern.ch    di-lepton system. Due to different signal sensitivities, the events are separated into three exclusive categories according to the jet multiplicity: H+0 jets, dominated by WW and W+jets backgrounds; H+1 jet, dominated by WW an tt background; and H+2 jets where the main background is tt and the main production mechanism is Vector Boson Fusion. The W + W \u2212 non resonant contribution is reduced requiring a small opening angle between the leptons. The remaining background is estimated using sidebands extrapolation for the di-lepton mass distribution ( fig.  1) for Higgs masses lower than 200 GeV/c 2 and Monte Carlo (MC) simulation for the high masses, where less statistics is available. The W+jets and QCD hard scattering background is controlled using a control sample of loosely identified leptons extrapolated to the signal region. Backgrounds induced by Z bosons are reduced requiring the dilepton mass to be outside the Z mass window. The remaining contribution is estimated using the events inside the Z mass window, rescaled using the ratio in/out estimated using simulation. The tt background is reduced rejecting events where a jet, considering jets with p T > 10 GeV/c, can be identified as b-quarks. The tagged sample, dominated by tt and tW, is used to extrapolate the residual contribution. Results for 1.55 fb \u22121 are shown in figure 2: a SM Higgs is excluded in the mass range from 147 GeV/c 2 to 194 GeV/c 2 , a wide sensitivity on the full mass range is exploited in the exclusion plot, even at low masses.",

This may lead to better sensitivity to SM Higgs boson production at high masses, where kinematic requirements can effectively suppress background. For the analysis we select events containing at least two leptons and two jets compatible with the Z mass hypothesis. Since the final states are fully reconstructed we can perform angular analysis: the initial zero spin of the Higgs bosons constraint the relative angles between the decays product. A dedicated likelihood is used to discriminate signal compatible events. Since Z+jets events involve gluon radiation we can use gluon-jets characteristics to reject them. In order to do this we build a likelihood discriminant based on number of neutral and charged tracks and their transverse momentum distribution. The effectiveness of the gluonquark likelihood discriminator is tested on photon+jets sample where jets mainly come from quarks. The tt background is suppressed requesting small E miss T and controlled using   Fig. 9.

The results are obtained using a shape analysis method. the e\u00b5 sample. Finally the presence of b-jets leads to a better characterization of the background. For this reason we divide the data sample in three main categories: 0 b-tag category, were events do not contain jets satisfying the b-tag algorithm; we use the quark-gluon likelihood discriminator to veto gluons events which are studies in a separate category; 1 b-tag category; 2 b-tag category. The background determination is completely data-driven: we use sidebands extrapolation from di-jet mass distribution, where sidebands are defined as (60 GeV/c 2 < m j j < 75 GeV/c 2 ) \u222a (105 GeV/c 2 < m j j < 130 GeV/c 2 ).
