The \u2126 0 c (J P = ( 1 2 ) + ) is the heaviest known singly charmed hadron that decays weakly. The quark content of the \u2126 0 c is c{ss}, where the ss pair is in a symmetric state. There are many theoretical models that predict the mass of the \u2126 0 c . However, the range of these predictions is rather wide: 2610-2786 MeV/c 2 [1]. Among several published measurements of the \u2126 0 c mass only three report a statistically significant signal: E687 obtains (2699.9 \u00b1 1.5 \u00b1 2.5) MeV/c 2 in the \u2126 0 c \u2192 \u03a3 + K \u2212 K \u2212 \u03c0 + channel [2], using five decay modes CLEO reports (2694.6 \u00b1 2.6 \u00b1 1.9) MeV/c 2 [3], BaBar quotes (2693.3 \u00b1 0.6) MeV/c 2 in their analysis of \u2126 * 0 c \u2192 \u2126 0 c \u03b3 [4]. The world-average value of the \u2126 0 c mass is (2697.5 \u00b1 2.6) MeV/c 2 [5].",

The dotted histogram inFig. 2(a)shows the contribution from the \u2126 \u2212 sidebands, which is featureless. A fit (\u03c7 2 /n.d.f. = 57.20/61) to the distribution with a Gaussian for the signal and a first-order polynomial for the background yields 725 \u00b1 45 events at a mass of (2693.6 \u00b1 0.3) MeV/c 2 ; the Gaussian width was found to be (4.9 \u00b1 0.3) MeV/c 2 .
