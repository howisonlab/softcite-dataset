To enhance the signal detection sensitivity and to avoid this dense BG region, we use a 2\u03c3 ellipse as the signal region for the UEML fit. The result of the fit is s = \u22123.9 +3.6 \u22123.2 , b = 13.9 +6.0 \u22124.8 with N = 10.  We examine the probability to obtain this result and evaluate the 90% CL upper limit using a toy MC simulation. The toy MC generates signal and BG events according to their PDFs fixing the expected number of BG events (b) atb = b, while varying the number of signal events (s). For every assumeds, 10,000 samples are generated following Poisson statistics with meanss andb for the signal and BG, respectively; the signal yield (s MC ) is evaluated by the UEML fit. To obtain the upper limit at the 90% CL (s 90 ) we take ans value that gives a 10% probability for s MC to be smaller than s. The probability to obtain s \u2264 \u22123.9 is 25% in the case of a null true signal. In other words, due to BG fluctuations a negative s value is possible with a large probability, although the physical signal rate is positive [21].",

Figure 5(a) shows the event distribution in the M inv -\u2206E plane. The signal extraction process is the same as that for \u03c4 \u2192 \u00b5\u03b3, described in the former section. The BG is composed of (18 \u00b1 18)% e + e \u2212 \u03b3 (radiative Bhabha), while the remainder is \u03c4 with N = 5. The toy MC gives a probability of 48% to obtain s \u2264 \u22120.14 in the case of a null signal. Figure 5(b) is the same as Fig. 3(b), but for the \u03c4 \u2192 e\u03b3 case. The upper limit ofs 90 = 3.3 is obtained by the toy MC in the case of the UEML fit result. The upper limit on the branching ratio is calculated as",

In this study, we have introduced four new requirements for E CM total , m 2 \u03bd , cos \u03b8 \u00b5\u03c4 and the magnitude of the thrust vector in the \u03c4 \u2192 \u00b5\u03b3 search and three new requirements for m 2 \u03bd , cos \u03b8 e\u03c4 and the magnitude of the thrust vector in the \u03c4 \u2192 e\u03b3 search. As a result of the optimized selection criteria, we obtain \u01eb = 5.07 (2.99)% and N obs = 10 (5) events in the 2\u03c3 elliptical signal region for \u03c4 \u2192 \u00b5\u03b3 (e\u03b3) in this analysis, compared to \u01eb = 12.0 (6.39)% and N obs = 54 (20) events over a 5\u03c3 signal box in our previous study. The improved selection leads to a value of \u01eb/ \u221a N obs that is almost the same as that in the previous analysis, and therefore the expected upper limit, which is approximately proportional to \u221a N obs /(\u01eb Ldt) in the case of no signal, has improved as 1/ Ldt rather than in proportion to 1/ Ldt, as would be the case if the previous selection criteria were used.
