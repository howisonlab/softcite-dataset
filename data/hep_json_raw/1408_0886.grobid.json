            "text": "A search for a massive W gauge boson decaying to a top quark and a bottom quark is performed with the ATLAS detector in pp collisions at the LHC. The dataset was taken at a centre-of-mass energy of \u221a s = 8 TeV and corresponds to 20.3 fb \u22121 of integrated luminosity. This analysis is done in the hadronic decay mode of the top quark, where novel jet substructure techniques are used to identify jets from high-momentum top quarks. This allows for a search for high-mass W bosons in the range 1.5-3.0 TeV. b-tagging is used to identify jets originating from b-quarks. The data are consistent with Standard Model background-only expectations, and upper limits at 95 % confidence level are set on the W \u2192 tb cross section times branching ratio ranging from 0.16 pb to 0.33 pb for left-handed W bosons, and ranging from 0.10 pb to 0.21 pb for W bosons with purely righthanded couplings. Upper limits at 95 % confidence level are set on the W -boson coupling to tb as a function of the W mass using an effective field theory approach, which is independent of details of particular models predicting a W boson.",

For instance, Grand Unified Theories [4][5][6][7] extend fundamental symmetries of the SM, in which a massive right-handed counterpart to the SM W boson may occur. W bosons can appear in phenomenological models involving extra space-time dimensions such as Kaluza-Klein excitations of the SM W boson [8] or in technicolor models [9]. Also Little Higgs theories [10] predict several new particles, including a W boson. In order to interpret a direct experimental search independently of the details of particular models predicting a W boson, it is advantageous to rely on e-mail: atlas.publications@cern.ch an effective model describing the couplings of the W boson to fermions [11].",

Jets are further calibrated using energy and \u03b7-dependent correction factors derived from simulation and with residual corrections from in-situ measurements [44]. Events with jets built from noisy calorimeter cells or non-collision backgrounds are removed [45]. In this analysis two radius parameters are used for jet reconstruction: a small-R radius of 0.4 and a large-R radius of 1.0. Small-R jets are required to have p T > 25 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.5. To minimise the impact of energy depositions from pile-up interactions the large-R jets are trimmed [46]. The trimming algorithm reconstructs jets using the k T jet algorithm with R = 0.3 built out of the constituents of the original large-R jet. Constituent jets contributing less than 5 % of the large-R jet p T are removed. The remaining energy depositions are used to calculate the jet kinematics and substructure properties. Large-R jets are required to have p T > 350 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.0.",

Ratios of the \u03c4 N (\u03c4 i j = \u03c4 i /\u03c4 j ) are then defined to discriminate if a jet is more i-or j-subjet-like. The \u03c4 i j distributions peak closer to 0 for i-subjet-like jets and closer to 1 for j-subjet-like jets. The optimisation procedure for the W top-tagger aims for an optimal compromise between the efficiency for jets originating from hadronically decaying top quarks and the rejection of jets originating from QCD-multijet production. First, an optimal requirement on \u221a d 12 is applied and then, selection criteria on the N -subjettiness variables are determined.  [55], infrared-safety of \u03c4 32 is ensured by the requirements on \u03c4 21 . The selection efficiency for jets originating from hadronic top-quark decays is estimated in MC simulations to be larger than 50 % for jet p T above 500 GeV, while the probability to falsely tag a light-quark, b-quark or gluon jet is below 10 % [51]. For jet p T below 800 GeV, where the sample size is sufficient, the top-tagging efficiency is cross-checked in data using single lepton tt events, and the top-tagging efficiency is found to be consistent between data and MC.",

In order to perform the offline analysis in the fully efficient regime of this trigger, the scalar sum of the transverse momenta of reconstructed small-R jets with p T > 25 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.5 is required to be at least 850 GeV. Candidate events must have at least one primary vertex with at least five tracks associated to it and have exactly one large-R W top-tagged jet (top candidate) and one small-R b-tagged jet (b-candidate) each with p T > 350 GeV and an angular separation R = ( \u03b7) 2 + ( \u03c6) 2 larger than 2.0 between the flight direction of the top candidate and the b-candidate. The invariant mass of the dijet system must be at least 1.1 TeV in order to avoid turn-on effects from the kinematic selection. The events are divided into two categories: the one b-tag category and the two b-tag category. For the two b-tag category, an additional b-tagged small-R jet with p T > 25 GeV has to be present close to the top candidate by requiring R between the small-R b-jet and the top candidate to be less than the large-R jet radius parameter 1.0. Figure 2 shows the acceptance times selection efficiency as a function of tb invariant mass at truth level in the one and two b-tag categories and the total signal efficiency corresponding to their sum. The difference in the efficiencies observed in the W L and W R models originates from the different top-tagging efficiencies, which is due to the preferred flight directions of the top-quark decay products in the top-quark rest frame for the two chiralities.

For each of the two categories, a function is chosen among several tested functions following a procedure based on the m tb distribution obtained from the initial background estimate (Sect. 5.2). For each function under study the corresponding fake signal bias is quantified by fitting the m tb distribution from the initial background estimate with a background-plus-signal model. The maximal extracted fake signal observed over the full range of W masses is chosen as systematic uncertainty on the background modelling (Sect. 6). The function with the least number of free parameters is chosen out of all tested functions giving similarly small bias. This procedure yields an exponential function with a polynomial of order n as its argument: exp n k=1 c k m k tb , with n = 4 (n = 2) in the one (two) b-tag category. Figure 4 shows background-only fits to the initial background estimate in the one and two b-tag categories using the chosen functions. The ratio of the distribution and the fit is also shown, where the uncertainties are the control-region and MC statistical uncertainties and the grey shaded band shows the statistical uncertainty in each bin as expected for 20.3 fb \u22121 . Deviations from 1 in the ratio plot are much smaller than the expected statistical uncertainty and the chosen background functions are hence shown to be flexible enough to describe the background distribution in the signal region.",

The b-tagging (mistagging) uncertainties are increased for high p T and reach up to 34 % (60 %) per jet. Uncertainties on the W top-tagger performance are evaluated based on the data-MC agreement as shown in Refs. [52,53]. They are derived comparing the ratio of each variable from jets built from calorimeter clusters and the corresponding jet built from tracks in the ID. The observed differences between data and MC are taken as variations on the substructure variables and are translated into an uncertainty on the efficiency of the W top-tagger. Within the kinematic reach, it has been shown with tt events in the single-lepton channel that these uncertainties cover any possible disagreement between the efficiency observed in data and MC simulations. The jet energy scale (JES) uncertainty [44] depends on the p T and \u03b7 of the reconstructed jet and includes the uncertainty on the b-jet energy scale. The JES of the two jet types are assumed to be correlated. The impact of the jet energy resolution uncertainty is evaluated by smearing the jet energy in the simulation to increase the nominal resolution. The uncertainty on the integrated luminosity is 2.8 % as derived from beamseparated scans [60]. Theoretical uncertainties are included by evaluating the change in the expected number of signal events. The deviations from varying the CTEQ6L1 PDF eigenvectors are summed in quadrature with the uncertainty from \u03b1 s , the renormalisation scale, and the change in acceptance at LO and NLO.

Figure 1 shows distributions of \u221a d 12 (top), \u03c4 32 with the \u221a d 12 requirement applied (centre), and \u03c4 21 with both \u221a d 12 and \u03c4 32 requirements applied (bottom) for jets originating from hadronically decaying top quarks in 2 TeV W L and W R MC simulations.
