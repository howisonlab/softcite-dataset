Subsequent experimental data over a wide range of energies indicate that similar effects exist for particle production at center-of-mass energies of tens of GeV and even as high as 200 GeV. The higher-energy data allow perturbative QCD (pQCD) to be used in attempting to interpret the results. While much remains to be learned, exciting progress has been made in the understanding of the observed transverse single-spin asymmetries at high energies, and the wealth of experimental data now becoming available is helping to drive the field forward.",

Subsequent measurements of forward charged pions by BRAHMS at 200 GeV revealed the same pattern as observed at 19.4 GeV: positive and negative pions exhibit near mirror symmetry in their behavior versus x F , with a larger magnitude than the neutral pions. In 2006, data at the intermediate energy of \u221a s = 62.4 GeV was taken at RHIC, and measurements of charged pions by BRAHMS 21 and neutral pions by PHENIX 22 again demonstrated the same pattern. In Fig. 2, the asymmetries for charged pions at all three energies are shown in overlapping kinematic ranges. The data at 62.4 and 200 GeV are for a transverse momentum (p T ) selection of 0.5-0.8 GeV/c; the 19.4 GeV data is for p T > 0.7 GeV/c. The positive pion points overlap at all three energies, suggesting some kind of scaling behavior.

The magnitude of the charged pion asymmetries appears to increase with increasing transverse momentum up to a p T of approximately 1.0 GeV/c; however, the neutral pion data imply an opposite trend. Additional high-statistics data allowing detailed study of the asymmetries as a function of various kinematic variables will be important to clarify the trends currently observed as well as to pin down theoretical models which can correctly describe the behavior of the asymmetries in terms of multiple kinematic variables. At present, several effects are believed to be potential contributors to the observed asymmetries, with existing descriptions based on twist-three, Sivers, and Collins mechanisms. [23][24][25] Contrary to a prior claim, 26 the magnitude of the pion asymmetries observed at at RHIC at 200 GeV can in fact be explained by the Collins mechanism. 27,28 The BRAHMS experiment has also measured transverse SSA's in kaon production at 62.4 and 200 GeV, and as the pions, they exhibit similar behavior at the two energies. As can be seen in Fig. 4, the asymmetry of both  charges is positive and of a similar magnitude. As shown in the figure, current theoretical calculations underpredict the negative kaon asymmetries. In addition to pions and kaons, BRAHMS has also measured proton asymmetries, as shown in Fig. 5. While the proton asymmetry is consistent with zero for both energies, the antiprotons at 200 GeV demonstrate a clear positive asymmetry. Unfortunately the data for a measurement of antiprotons at 62.4 GeV are not available. These surprising results remain completely unexplained. In contrast to the forward pion and kaon asymmetries, a measurement of neutral pions and charged hadrons at midrapidity for 1 < p T < 5 GeV/c was performed by PHENIX and found to be consistent with zero within a few percent. 29 Improvement of a factor of approximately 200 compared to the results published is anticipated in measurements at PHENIX of the transverse SSA of midrapidity neutral pions based on data taken in 2006 and 2008. The published result is sensitive mainly to gluon-gluon scattering and has been used to constrain the gluon Sivers function. 30 The more recent data are expected to provide at low p T an even stronger constraint on the gluon Sivers function and at higher p T increased sensitivity to quark effects.",

Results are also available as a function of transverse momentum. The significant systematic uncertainties indicated in the figure are due mainly to the estimation of the background contribution and should be improved in the future by the planned forward silicon detector upgrade to PHENIX. A direct comparison between the calculations of Anselmino et al., 31 done for D mesons, and the present results, which are for single muons resulting from the decay of both charm and bottom mesons, is not currently possi- ble. However, it is worth noting that the magnitude of the observed muon asymmetries at positive x F is significantly smaller than the calculation of 10-15% asymmetries in a similar x F and p T range for D mesons. We thus hope that with some further work in translating between D mesons and their decay muons it will be possible to use these data to place a stronger constraint on the gluon Sivers function than presently available.",

This is in contrast to J/\u03a8 production in semi-inclusive DIS, in which a non-zero transverse single-spin asymmetry is predicted in the color-octet model but zero asymmetry in the color-singlet model. Preliminary results on the J/\u03a8 transverse SSA in p + p collisions can be seen in Fig. 6. Early estimates suggest that an asymmetry of the order of a few percent at positive x F , consistent with the data, may be possible due to indirect J/\u03a8 production coming from feed-down from the \u03c7 c , assuming a gluon Sivers function of approximately 0.5x (1\u2212x)xG(x). 33 However, more detailed theoretical work will be needed to clarify what can be learned from the current experimental result; improvement in the experimental measurement is expected once analysis of the 2008 transverse data set from PHENIX has been completed.",

As can be seen in the figure, the forward asymmetry exhibits no dependence on x F , while the asymmetry in the backward direction is consistent with zero.

Unlike other results presented above, the kinematics of the neutron measurement are not in a regime described by perturbative processes.

For inclusive pion measurements, enough statistics are available to allow first studies of the asymmetry dependence on p T and rapidity in addition to x F . The behavior of the SSA's as a function of various kinematic variables is essential to constrain phenomenological models of the underlying physics generating the asymmetries. With first extractions of the Collins fragmentation function as well as the transversity and Sivers distributions now available thanks to measurements in e + e \u2212 and SIDIS, an increasing amount can be learned from proton-proton collision data. The long future of the RHIC spin program promises a myriad of further transverse-spin results, and hadronic data will play a crucial role in our understanding of transversity and transversemomentum-dependent distributions as the field comes to maturity.",
