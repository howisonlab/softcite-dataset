The analysis is performed using proton-proton collision data at \u221a s = 13 TeV recorded in 2016 by the CMS detector at the LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 . The results are in agreement with standard model (SM) predictions. In a search for resonant production, upper limits are set on the cross section for new spin-0 or spin-2 particles. For the SM-like nonresonant production hypothesis, the data exclude a product of cross section and branching fraction larger than 2.0 fb at 95% confidence level (CL), corresponding to about 24 times the SM prediction. Values of the effective Higgs boson self-coupling \u03ba \u03bb are constrained to be within the range \u221211 < \u03ba \u03bb < 17 at 95% CL, assuming all other Higgs boson couplings are at their SM value. The constraints on \u03ba \u03bb are the most restrictive to date.",

The production of a pair of Higgs bosons (HH) is a rare process that is sensitive to the structure of the BEH potential through the Higgs boson's self-coupling mechanism. In the SM, the corresponding production cross section via gluon-gluon fusion in proton-proton (pp) collisions at \u221a s = 13 TeV is predicted to be \u03c3 gg\u2192HH = 33.5 +2.5 \u22122.8 fb [6][7][8], a value beyond the reach of the analyses based on the current integrated luminosity of the CERN LHC program.",

            "text": "Many theories beyond the SM (BSM) suggest the existence of heavy particles that can couple to a pair of Higgs bosons. These particles could appear as a resonant contribution to the invariant mass of the HH system and induce a significant increase of the HH production cross section with respect to the SM. For example, models with warped extra dimensions (WED) [9] postulate the existence of compactified extra spatial dimensions. They predict new resonances decaying to a Higgs boson pair, including spin-0 radions R [10] and spin-2 Kaluza-Klein gravitons (KK graviton) [11]. The benchmark scenario considered in this paper, the E-mail address: cms -publication -committee -chair @cern .ch. bulk Randall-Sundrum (RS) model [12], assumes that all fields can propagate in the extra dimension. Models with an extended Higgs sector also predict a spin-0 resonance that decays to a pair of SM Higgs bosons, if sufficiently massive. Examples of such models are the singlet extension of the SM [13], the two-Higgs-doublet models [14] (in particular, the minimal supersymmetric model [15]), and the Georgi-Machacek model [16]. Many of these models predict that heavy scalar production occurs predominantly through the gluon-gluon fusion process. The Lorentz structure of the effective coupling between the scalar and the gluon is the same for a radion or a heavy Higgs boson. Therefore, the kinematics for the production of a radion or an additional Higgs boson are essentially the same, provided the spin-0 resonance is narrow. The radion results can therefore be applied to constrain this class of models.",

There is a dependence of the k-factors on m HH related to the finite top quark mass effects [44]. Within the region of sensitivity of this analysis, m HH < 900 GeV, any effect is covered by the total k-factor uncertainty. The departure of the parameters from their SM values can change the total cross section by a few orders of magnitude. Furthermore, the kinematic properties of the HH final state are modified, which affects the final sensitivity through the modification of the acceptance and efficiency of the experimental analysis.",

In addition to this correction, a jet energy regression procedure is used to improve the m jj resolution. A multivariate analysis technique is used to correct the absolute scale of the heavy-quark jets by taking into account their specific fragmentation features, i.e., a larger contribution from charged leptons and neutrinos than in light-quark jets. The approach we use in this letter is similar to the one used in the CMS search for the SM H \u2192 bb decays [62], and in addition, takes advantage of variables related to the missing transverse momentum vector, p miss T , to estimate the neutrino contribution to the heavy-quark decay. The p miss T is calculated as the negative of the vectorial sum of the transverse momenta of all PF candidates. The jets forming the dijet candidate are ordered by p T , and an optimized energy regression distinguishes the higher p T jet from the lower p T one. The improvement to the m jj resolution due to the regression procedure depends on the b jet p T spectrum characteristic of a given signal hypothesis. For example, for the SM-like search it is of the order of 15%.",

Since the M X spectrum for SM-like ggHH production has a maximum at around 400 GeV and the n\u03b3 + jets background peaks at the kinematic threshold of 250 GeV = 2m H , the maximal sensitivity is achieved for M X > 350 GeV. However, anomalous couplings may change the M X distribution for the signal hypothesis. Therefore, instead of imposing a M X selection, events are categorized in the nonresonant search into high-mass (HM) and low-mass (LM) regions that are above and below M X = 350 GeV, respectively.",

For the resonant cases, the ensemble of resonant signals is used to train one BDT for m X < 600 GeV and another one for m X > 600 GeV. This training strategy maximizes the sensitivity to massive resonances. The background events used for the training are obtained from a control sample that was extracted from the data by inverting the identification condition on one of the two photons. This sample is dominated by events having a photon produced with three accompanying jets. We verified that after excluding the events with 120 < m \u03b3 \u03b3 < 130 GeV in the signal and control samples, the kinematic properties of these two samples are well matched. Fig. 4 shows the BDT output from one of the four trainings. The MVA efficiently separates gluon-gluon produced signals from the n\u03b3 + jets background that represents the dominant contribution to the data. The most powerful discriminating variables used in the BDT are the b tagging scores of the jets, followed by the kinematic variables. Therefore, the single-Higgs boson production samples with genuine contributions from two b quarks (ttH and Z(\u2192 bb)H) are classified as more signal-like, while ggH and other VH processes are classified as more background-like. Finally, events from the VBF HH production are selected less efficiently than those from ggHH production.",

The improvement is smaller than the relative contribution of the VBF production cross section to the total one in the SM because of the nonoptimal selection efficiency of this analysis for the VBF events, as explained in Section 5. The results are also interpreted in the context of Higgs boson anomalous couplings. Limits on the different BSM benchmark hypotheses (listed in Table 1) are shown in Fig. 11 (top). Using the limits on the benchmark hypotheses and the map between the clusters and the points in the 5D BSM parameter space, one can estimate the constraints provided by these data in different regions of phase space. It is important to stress that the same analysis categories are used for the SM-like search and for all BSM nonresonant searches. The differences between the limits come only from the kinematic properties of the benchmark signal hypotheses. For instance, the tightest constraint is placed on the benchmark 2 hypothesis, which features a m HH spectrum that extends above 1 TeV owing to large contributions from dimension-6 operators. The least restrictive constraint is on benchmark 7 that describes models with large values of \u03ba \u03bb , where the m HH spectrum peaks below 300 GeV.",
