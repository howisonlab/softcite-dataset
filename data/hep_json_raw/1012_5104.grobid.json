Events were collected using a single-arm minimumbias trigger. The charged-particle multiplicity, its dependence on transverse momentum and pseudorapidity and the relationship between the mean transverse momentum and charged-particle multiplicity are measured. Measurements in different regions of phase space are shown, providing diffraction-reduced measurements as well as more inclusive ones. The observed distributions are corrected to well-defined phase-space regions, using model-independent corrections. The results are compared to each other and to various Monte Carlo (MC) models, including a new AMBT1 pythia6 tune. In all the kinematic regions considered, the particle multiplicities are higher than predicted by the MC models. The central charged-particle multiplicity per event and unit of pseudorapidity, for tracks with p T > 100 MeV, is measured to be 3.483 \u00b1 0.009 (stat) \u00b1 0.106 (syst) at \u221a s = 0.9 TeV and 5.630 \u00b1 0.003 (stat) \u00b1 0.169 (syst) at \u221a s = 7 TeV.",

These measurements provide insight into the strong interactions at low energy scales. Several quantum chromodynamics (QCD)-inspired models have been developed to interpret them. These models are frequently cast into Monte Carlo (MC) simulations with free parameters that can be constrained by measurements such as minimum bias distributions. These measurements contribute to the understanding of soft QCD; moreover, they are important in the determination of biases on high-p T phenomena due to underlying events (UEs) and event pileup effects and are therefore of growing importance for future Large Hadron Collider (LHC) physics. The measurements presented in this paper implement a similar strategy to that in [1]. A single-arm trigger overlapping with the acceptance of the tracking volume is used. The results are presented as inclusive-inelastic distributions, with minimal model dependence; a minimum number of charged particles within well-defined p T and \u03b7 selection are required.",

At \u221a s = 0.9 TeV the sample is similar to that used for the first ATLAS minimum-bias publication [1]. The results are also presented at \u221a s = 2.36 TeV where the track reconstruction setup differs significantly from that at the other energies, due to the silicon tracker (SCT) not being at nominal voltage. The integrated luminosity at this energy is estimated to be \u223c0.1 \u00b5b \u22121 .",

Primary charged particles are defined as charged particles with a mean lifetime \u03c4 > 0.3 \u00d7 10 \u221210 s either directly produced in pp interactions or from subsequent decays of particles with a shorter lifetime. The charged-particle multiplicity results are compared to particle-level MC predictions. Three different phase-space regions are considered in this paper, with varying selection both on the p T and the number of charged particles per event; all phase-space regions require tracks within |\u03b7| < 2.5. Diffractive physics is expected to contribute mostly at low numbers of charged particles and at low track momentum. Therefore, varying the selection on n ch and p T in effect varies the relative contribution from diffractive events. Appendix B shows the results 4 for two additional phase-space regions useful for MC tuning. This measurement, with refined corrections and systematic uncertainty determination, supersedes the results presented in [1].",

For this measurement, the trigger relies on the L1 signals from the Beam Pickup Timing Devices (BPTX) and the Minimum Bias Trigger Scintillators (MBTS). The BPTX stations are composed of electrostatic button pick-up detectors attached to the beam pipe at \u00b1175 m from the centre of the ATLAS detector. The coincidence of the BPTX signal between the two sides of the detector is used to determine when bunches are colliding at the centre of the ATLAS detector. The MBTS are mounted at each end of the detector in front of the liquidargon end-cap calorimeter cryostats at z = \u00b13.56 m. They are segmented into eight sectors in azimuth and two rings in pseudorapidity (2.09 < |\u03b7| < 2.82 and 2.82 < |\u03b7| < 3.84). The data were collected for this analysis using a trigger requiring a BPTX coincidence and MBTS trigger signals. The MBTS trigger used for this paper is configured to require one hit above threshold from either side of the detector, referred to as a single-arm trigger. The efficiency of this trigger is studied with a separate prescaled L1 BPTX trigger, filtered to obtain inelastic interactions by Inner Detector requirements at L2 and EF, the latter only for the 900 GeV data.",

The pythia6 diffraction is based on a Regge-based pomeron model to generate the cross-section and generate the diffractive mass and momentum transfer [30,31]. To allow the Regge model to cover the full phase space, empirical corrections are introduced [21]. These have the effect of enhancing the production of 6 small masses and suppressing production near the kinematic limit. Particle production from low mass states (M X < 1 GeV) is treated as an isotropic two-body decay. Particle production from high mass states is based on the string model. Two string configurations are possible depending on whether the pomeron couples to a quark or gluon [21]. The pythia8 model uses the same model as pythia6 to generate the cross-section and generate the diffractive mass and momentum transfer. The particle production for low mass states uses the string model, but for higher masses (M X > 10 GeV) a perturbative element based on pomeron-proton scattering is introduced. The non-perturbative string model introduces a mass dependence on the relative probability of the pomeron scattering off a quark to scattering off a gluon, which enhances the gluon probability at high masses. The perturbative pomeron-proton scattering uses HERA diffractive PDFs [32] and the standard multiple interactions framework is used to generate the parton-parton scattering. The introduction of the perturbative pomeron-proton scattering results in a harder p T and multiplicity spectrum for diffractive events generated with pythia8 compared with those generated with pythia6 [33]. However, it should be noted that relatively little tuning has been made of the diffractive processes in pythia6 and pythia8.",

The first ATLAS measurements of charged-particle production at the LHC [1] measured the charged-particle production at \u221a s = 0.9 TeV in the central region to be 5-15% higher than the MC models predict. In addition, neither the high n ch nor the high p T distributions were well described by this tune and the p T was overestimated in events with n ch > 20. A new tune, AMBT1, was developed in order to adapt the free parameters of the ND models to the new experimental data at \u221a s = 0.9 TeV and \u221a s = 7 TeV, using the same PDFs and pythia6 model choices as MC09. The AMBT1 tune is obtained by tuning to ATLAS minimum bias data at both \u221a s = 0.9 TeV and \u221a s = 7 TeV in a diffraction-reduced phase space that is presented in this paper: n ch 6, p T > 500 MeV, |\u03b7| < 2.5. The tune was derived using preliminary versions of these distributions [34]. The starting point for this tune is the ATLAS MC09c [22] pythia6 tune. MC09c is an extension of the ATLAS MC09 tune where the strength of the colour reconnection (CR) was tuned to describe the p T versus n ch distributions measured by CDF in pp collisions at the Tevatron [7].",

The analysis at \u221a s = 2.36 TeV has been performed using two complementary methods for reconstructing tracks.

An additional algorithm configuration is run using only the hits that have not been used by the first algorithm. This additional algorithm uses wider initial roads and has a looser requirement on the number of silicon hits. This second algorithm contributes around 60% of the tracks from 100 to 150 MeV, mostly due to the tracks having too low a momentum to go far enough in the SCT detector to satisfy the silicon hit requirement of the original algorithm; this fraction decreases rapidly, reaching less than 2% at 200 MeV.",

Note that n BS sel is defined as the number of tracks passing all of the track selection requirements except for the constraints with respect to the primary vertex; instead, the unsigned transverse impact parameter with respect to the beam spot, |d BS 0 |, is required to be less than 1.8 mm.  [44,45]. There are no simulation samples that fully describe the SCT operating at reduced voltage. A technique to emulate the impact of operating the SCT in standby was developed in simulation; this corrects the MC without re-simulation by modifying the silicon clusterization algorithm used to study the tracking performance. However, the final ID track efficiency at \u221a s = 2.36 TeV was determined using a correction to the track reconstruction efficiency derived from data at \u221a s = 0.9 TeV. Pixel tracks were reconstructed using the standard track reconstruction algorithms limited to Pixel hits and with different track requirements. There is little redundant information, because at least three measurement points are needed to obtain a momentum measurement and the average number of Pixel hits per track is three in the barrel. Therefore, the Pixel track reconstruction efficiency is very sensitive to the location of inactive Pixel modules. The total distance between the first and the last measurement point in the pixel detector, as well as the limited number of measurement points per track, limit the momentum resolution of the tracks; therefore the Pixel tracks were refitted using the reconstructed primary vertex as an additional measurement point. The refitting improves the momentum resolution by almost a factor of two. However, the Pixel track momentum resolution remains a factor of three worse than the resolution of ID tracks.",

Beam-induced backgrounds are estimated from non-colliding empty bunches using the same method as described in [1]; after final event selection, fewer than 0.1% of events are predicted to originate from beam-induced backgrounds. The reconstructed primary vertex requirement is particularly useful in suppressing the beam-induced background.

Events are rejected if they have a second vertex with four or more tracks 14 .

Their contribution is estimated using MC predictions for the shape of the d 0 distribution for primaries, non-primaries from electrons and other nonprimaries. The separation between non-primaries from electrons and non-electrons is needed as the electrons are mostly from conversions in the detector material and would thus be sensitive to a mismodelling of the detector material, whereas the non-electron non-primary tracks are mostly from long-lived particles and this fraction is thus also sensitive to the underlying physics.

            "text": "Systematic uncertainties. As the track reconstruction efficiency is determined from MC, the main systematic uncertainties result from the level of agreement between data and MC. The overwhelming majority of particles in the selected events are hadrons. These are known to suffer from hadronic interactions with the material in the detector. Thus a good description of the material in the detector is needed to get a good description of the track reconstruction efficiency. To quantify the influence of an imperfect description of the detector description, in particular the material in the simulation, two different data-driven methods are used. The first reconstructs the invariant mass of K 0 s mesons decaying to two charged pions; the second compares the track lengths in data and simulation. The K 0 s mass method studies the mass as a function of the decay radius of the meson; it has greatest sensitivity to small radii, while the track length study probes the material description in the simulation in terms of nuclear interaction length (\u03bb) in the SCT detector. The combination of both methods provides good sensitivity throughout the silicon detectors. They allow us to constrain the material to better than 10% in the central barrel region and better than 30% at the highest |\u03b7| measured. The material uncertainty is the largest uncertainty in almost all regions of all distributions plotted in this paper. In the barrel region, the total uncertainty due to the material is 8% at low p T , going down to 2% above 500 MeV. The uncertainty increases with increasing |\u03b7|; the largest uncertainties are in the region 2.3 < |\u03b7| < 2.5: 15% in the first p T bin decreasing to 7% above 500 MeV.",

These are mostly very low momentum particles that are reconstructed with much higher momentum due to misalignment or nuclear interactions 16 . Mismeasured tracks are seen predominantly at the edges of the \u03b7 acceptance where the distance between consecutive measurement points of the outer layer of the Pixel and the first layer of the SCT can reach up to \u223c1 m. The fraction of mismeasured tracks is observed to be significantly more in data than in MC even after this cut is applied. Two different methods are used to estimate the fraction of mismeasured tracks in data. The first compares the momentum obtained from the tracks reconstructed using only the SCT hit information to that obtained for fully reconstructed tracks. After normalizing the number of well-measured tracks in MC to data, the scaling of the MC high-p T tails needed to model the data is obtained. The second method uses the difference between data and MC seen in the tails of the d 0 distributions at high p T because mismeasured tracks tend to have poorly reconstructed d 0 . Again a scaling factor is obtained to scale the MC tails in order to describe the data. These two methods give very similar results. Both methods are used to obtain the systematic uncertainty for all but the outermost regions in \u03b7 where the effect is the most significant. In this region an additional method is used that compares the \u03b7 distributions, normalized in the central region, in bins of p T . The variation with p T of the \u03b7 distribution due to physics is small compared to the differences observed due to mismeasured tracks. The additional tracks at high |\u03b7|, high p T are considered to be due to mismeasured tracks and the fraction of mismeasured tracks in data is obtained. This third method gives the systematic uncertainty for the outermost \u03b7 bins. Averaged over the whole \u03b7 region, the fraction of mismeasured tracks in data is found to be negligible for p T < 10 GeV, 3% for 10 < p T < 15 GeV and increases to 30% for 30 < p T < 50 GeV. An additional systematic on the track reconstruction efficiency of 10% is taken for all tracks with p T > 10 GeV due to different efficiencies of the \u03c7 2 probability cut in data and MC. All systematic uncertainties on the mismeasured high-p T tracks are taken as single-sided errors.",

To investigate this effect, the average track reconstruction efficiency derived using the p T spectrum in data and that obtained from MC are compared. The difference of these two mean efficiencies is then treated in the same way as the uncertainty on track reconstruction efficiency, described in the previous paragraph. This uncertainty is taken to be asymmetric; only the contribution from a shift of the spectrum in the direction of the data is taken.

The only additional systematic uncertainty due to the tuning of the track reconstruction efficiency is due to the difference between the biases introduced by the vertex correction in MC and data. The estimation of this error is done by comparing the z 0 distribution in n BS sel = 2 between data and MC. The z 0 distribution is a very good probe of the correlation between n sel /n ch and n BS sel as events with high n sel tend to have small z 0 values, while events with n sel < 2 tend to have large z 0 . Very good agreement is found between the data and MC. Re-weighting the z 0 distribution in MC to match the data or applying the vertex correction extracted from the data to the MC closure test leads to a systematic uncertainty of the order of 0.1% for n ch = 2 where this effect is most pronounced.

Secondly, the matrix obtained after the final iteration of the n ch unfolding described in section 7.1 is applied to each of the distributions to unfold n sel to n ch . Finally, the ratio of the two distributions is taken to obtain the corrected p T versus n ch distribution. For this distribution we exclude tracks with p T > \u221a s/2 as they are clearly unphysical; this removes 1 track at \u221a s = 0.9 TeV and 1 track at \u221a s = 7 TeV. This unfolding procedure assumes that the tracking efficiency depends only on p T and \u03b7 and is independent of the track particle multiplicity and that the p T spectrum of the tracks in events that migrate back from a given n sel bin to a given n ch bin is the same as the p T spectrum of tracks in events in the corresponding n sel bin. The fact that these assumptions are not completely valid is taken as a systematic uncertainty. This uncertainty is obtained by looking at the non-closure of the corrected distribution in the MC. This residual non-closure is, we believe, a consequence of the two main assumptions. A full parameterization of the track reconstruction efficiency in terms of p T , \u03b7 and n ch would remove the need for the first assumption, while a full two-dimensional unfolding as a single step where the two dimensions were p T and n ch would remove the need for the second. Both of these are beyond the scope of the current paper. In order to understand if the amount of non-closure is a realistic estimate of the uncertainty on the method when applied to data, in particular to investigate its dependence on the p T spectrum, the whole unfolding procedure is carried out using pythia6 DW tune samples and the pythia8 samples; we varied both the input distribution and the matrix used to do the unfolding. The level of non-closure is found to be similar to that obtained with the MC09 pythia6 samples. We thus conclude that the level of non-closure is not strongly dependent on the p T spectrum. This allows us to use the residual non-closure as a systematic uncertainty on the unfolding method as described in the next section.",

For these cases a larger systematic uncertainty is applied to cover the non-closure. For the analyses with p T > 500 MeV, where the size of a non-closure is larger, a 3% systematic error is applied in the n ch = 1 bin.

At 900 GeV the slope versus n ch for high values of n ch seems to be well described by most models but the absolute value is best modelled by pythia6 DW. At the highest centre-of-mass energy above 20 particles the models vary widely both in slope and in absolute value; at low values of n ch none of the models describe the data very well. In the more inclusive phase-space region, figures 12(a) and (b), the models vary widely, especially at high \u221a s. TeV is the value obtained using the Pixel track method. The phase-space region with the largest minimum p T and the highest minimum multiplicity ( p T > 500 MeV; n ch 6), which is the region with the least amount of diffraction, is the one where the models vary the least and the energy extrapolations of most models agree best with the data. However, in this region the energy extrapolations of pythia6 and phojet do not agree with the data. For the most inclusive measurements, none of the models agree with the data and the spread at 7 TeV in the expected values is almost one third of the mean predicted value. The observed value is significantly higher at this energy than any of the models.",

The first phase-space region is chosen to be compared to the other diffraction-reduced phase-space region with six particles above 500 MeV and allows the study of the interplay between the number of particles and the p T , in particular for the study of diffraction models. The second additional phase-space region is chosen so as to be less influenced by non-perturbative parts of the ND modelling and to be useful in predicting high-p T particle rates, for example for trigger studies.
