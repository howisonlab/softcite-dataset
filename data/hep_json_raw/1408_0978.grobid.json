In the Standard Model (SM) there are no tree-level Feynman diagrams for these processes, which proceed via box or electroweak loop (penguin) diagrams. The SM amplitudes are suppressed at loop order, increasing the sensitivity of measurements in these decay channels to physics beyond the SM. Additionally, leading form-factor uncertainties cancel in the measurement of asymmetries, allowing for precise theoretical predictions. Examples include the isospin asymmetry [3], the zero crossing point of the \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 forward-backward asymmetry [1,4], and the direct CP asymmetry, A CP . This paper describes measurements of A CP in B 0 \u2192 K * 0 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 and B + \u2192 K + \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 decays using data corresponding to 3.0 fb \u22121 of integrated luminosity collected by LHCb in 2011 and 2012, at centre-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 TeV, respectively.

            "text": "The LHCb detector [12] is a single-arm forward spectrometer covering the pseudorapidity range 2 < \u03b7 < 5, designed for the study of particles containing b or c quarks. The detector includes a high-precision tracking system consisting of a silicon-strip vertex detector (VELO) surrounding the pp interaction region, a large-area silicon-strip detector located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4 Tm, and three stations of silicon-strip detectors and straw drift tubes [13] placed downstream of the magnet. The polarity of the dipole magnet is reversed periodically throughout data-taking. The tracking system provides a measurement of momentum, p, with a relative uncertainty that varies from 0.4% at low momentum to 0.6% at 100 GeV/c. The minimum distance of a track to a primary pp interaction vertex (PV), the impact parameter (IP), is measured with a resolution of (15 + 29/p T ) \u00b5m, where p T is the component of p transverse to the beam, in GeV/c. Different types of charged hadrons are distinguished using information from two ring-imaging Cherenkov (RICH) detectors [14]. Photon, electron and hadron candidates are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter and a hadronic calorimeter. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers [15]. The trigger [16] consists of a hardware stage, based on information from the calorimeter and muon systems, followed by a software stage, which applies a full event reconstruction. Simulated events are used in the process of selecting candidates, examining background contributions, and in determining the efficiency of the selections. In the simulation, pp collisions are generated using Pythia [17,18] with a specific LHCb configuration [19]. Decays of hadronic particles are described by EvtGen [20], in which final-state radiation is generated using Photos [21]. The interaction of the generated particles with the detector and its response are implemented using the Geant4 toolkit [22,23] as described in ref. [24]. The simulated samples are reweighted to model more accurately the data distributions in variables used in the analysis. These include the p T of the B meson, the number of tracks in the event, and the \u03c7 2 of the vertex fit to the final-state tracks, which may differ due to misalignments of the detector and mismodelling of the material description in the VELO region. In addition, information about the IP and momentum resolution is used. The particle identification (PID) performance is corrected to match the data using D * + \u2192 (D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + )\u03c0 + and J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 control channels. The B + \u2192 K + \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 samples are also reweighted for the p T of the decay products.",

A requirement on the B candidate vertex fit \u03c7 2 per degree of freedom is applied to provide a good quality vertex fit. Additionally, the angle between the momentum vector of the B candidate and the vector between the primary and B candidate decay vertices must be less than 14 mrad, and the B candidates must be consistent with originating from the PV. The tracks from the B candidate decay products are required to be well separated from the PV, helping to reject events where a final-state track does not come from the decay vertex of the B meson. The kaons, pions and muons must be positively identified by PID information from the RICH detectors and muon systems, combined using likelihood functions. This initial selection is followed by a more stringent selection using multivariate methods, based on a boosted decision tree (BDT) [25,26]. For B + \u2192 K + \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 decays, simulated signal decays are used for the BDT training, along with data from the upper mass sideband, 5700 < m(K + \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) < 6000 MeV/c 2 , which is not used in the remainder of the analysis. The BDT uses a selection of geometric and kinematic variables and has an efficiency of 90% for signal while removing 95% of background. Following previous analyses [1], the B 0 \u2192 K * 0 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 BDT training uses a signal sample containing background-subtracted data from the B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8(\u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 )K * 0 control mode, and a background sample from the upper mass sideband 5350 < m(K + \u03c0 \u2212 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) < 7000 MeV/c 2 .
