The analysis is based on data from proton-proton collisions corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb \u22121 collected with the CMS detector at the LHC at \u221a s = 8 TeV. The dominant multijet background expectations are obtained from low jet multiplicity control samples. Data agree well with the standard model background predictions, and limits are set in several benchmark models. Colorons (axigluons) with masses between 0.6 and 0.75 (up to 1.15) TeV are excluded at 95% confidence level. Similar exclusion limits for gluinos in R-parity violating supersymmetric scenarios are from 0.6 up to 1.1 TeV. These results comprise the first experimental probe of the coloron and axigluon models in multijet final states.",

            "text": "Searching for new phenomena in final states with jets has been a tradition at hadron colliders that has continued at every new energy frontier. New particles decaying into jets are likely to be strongly produced; therefore, one expects these phenomena to have relatively large cross sections and be detectable at the CERN LHC. The challenge of searching in high-multiplicity all-hadronic final states without significant missing transverse momentum is the handling of the overwhelming multijet background. To remedy this situation, the focus of these searches has been on resonances having either narrow widths or large masses, in order to enhance the signal-to-background ratio and, consequently, the sensitivity. The presence of new phenomena in the simplest of multijet final states, the dijets, has been sought in proton-antiproton collisions at \u221a s = 0.63 TeV by the UA1 [1] and UA2 [2,3] Collaborations at the CERN SppS, and at \u221a s = 1.8 and 1.96 TeV by the CDF [4][5][6][7][8][9] and D0 [10][11][12] Collaborations at the Fermilab Tevatron, as well as in proton-proton collisions at \u221a s = 7, 8, and 13 TeV by the AT-LAS [13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20][21] and CMS [22][23][24][25][26][27][28][29][30][31][32] Collaborations at the LHC. The complexity of these searches increases dramatically with the increase in jet multiplicity, even when several resonances are E-mail address: cms-publication-committee-chair@cern.ch. present in the production and decay chain. The reason is an exponentially increasing combinatorial background, which makes it virtually impossible to take advantage of either two-jet or multijet resonances in multijet final states. For example, consider the production of a pair of new particles X, each of which decays to a pair of particles Y that further decay into a dijet final state each. One would then expect invariant masses of four dijet combinations in the 8-jet final state to peak at the mass of the Y particle, and, likewise, the invariant masses of two 4-jet combinations would peak at the mass of the X particle. These measurements would make it seemingly easy to discern the signal from the multijet background, which lacks such features. Nevertheless, the total number of ways to arrange 8 jets into four pairs is 7!! \u2261 7 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 1 = 105, and, on top of this, there are C 2 4 /2 = 3 possible arrangements of four pairs into two quadruplets, yielding 315 possible combinations. In practice the correct jet assignment is thus overwhelmed by the wrong combinations. Moreover, the number of ways to partition 8 jets into two quadruplets is C 4 was made to find the correct jet combination. Some of these analyses tag jets originating from b quarks (b-tagged jets), which allows them to improve sensitivity to new particles decaying to b quarks, thanks to a significant reduction in the multijet background.",

The technique is based on the observation that in multijet events the additional energetic jets (beyond the 2 \u2192 2 hard scattering) are produced mainly via finalstate radiation. This process approximately conserves the H T in the event, while increasing the jet multiplicity. Therefore, one could use the H T spectrum at lower multiplicities, not contaminated by potential signal, to predict its shape at higher multiplicities. This technique, subsequently used in other CMS publications [46,47,52], forms the basis of the present analysis.",

This approach makes the analysis sensitive to a large class of models of new physics.

The signal simulation is done for coloron masses M C in the range from 0.4 to 1.5 TeV (in steps of 0.1 TeV), with a width C equal to 20% of M C , and for a hyperpion mass equal to M C /3 (i.e. in the specific model of Ref.

Two distinct decay topologies of pair-produced axigluons are considered in this analysis. The first topology is the decay of each axigluon to a pair of mass-degenerate color-octet scalar and pseudoscalar particles, each of which further decays to two gluons. The scalar particle mass M \u03c3 and the pseudoscalar particle mass M\u03c0 are both chosen to be 1/4 or 1/3 of the axigluon mass M A , with M A ranging from 0.1 to 1.5 TeV in steps of 0.1 TeV. The values of the mass ratio are chosen so that the decays of the axigluon to scalar and pseudoscalar particles dominate [63], and constraints imposed by 4-jet resonance searches [33-36] are avoided. Those searches would be sensitive to this model in the case of a light (pseudo)scalar when two gluon jets from its decay overlap and are reconstructed as a single jet. The width A of the axigluon is taken to be either 10 or 15% of M A [63]. The second topology is the decay of the axigluon to a heavy color-triplet fermion in association with a light quark ( Fig. 1 bottom). The heavy quark subsequently decays to a quark and a light scalar \u03b7 that decays to a bottom quark-antiquark pair. This signal topology is simulated for M A ranging from 0.4 to 1.5 TeV, in 0.1 TeV steps.",

The data were collected with a trigger based on jets reconstructed with the calorimeter-only information. At the HLT, the jets are clustered from the ECAL and HCAL energy deposits, using the anti-k T clustering algorithm [78] with a distance parameter of R = 0.5. Jet energies are corrected for the calorimeter response [79]. The trigger requires the scalar sum of p T of all the HLT jets to exceed a threshold that was increased progressively from 550 to 750 GeV to maintain a constant trigger rate despite the increase in the instantaneous luminosity delivered by the LHC. Offline, events are reconstructed using a particle-flow algorithm [80,81] that identifies each single particle (photon, electron, muon, charged hadron, and neutral hadron) with an optimized combination of all subdetector information. The energy of photons is directly obtained from the ECAL measurement corrected for zero-suppression effects. The energy of electrons is determined from a combination of the track momentum at the main interaction vertex, the corresponding ECAL cluster energy and the energy sum of all bremsstrahlung photons attached to the track. The energy of muons is obtained from the corresponding track momentum. The energy of charged hadrons is determined from a combination of the track momentum and the corresponding ECAL and HCAL energy, corrected for zero-suppression effects, and for the response function of the calorimeters to hadronic showers. Finally, the energy of neutral hadrons is obtained from the corresponding corrected ECAL and HCAL energy.",

The operating point of the CSV algorithm [83] used to tag b quark jets is defined by the minimum threshold on the discriminator at which the misidentification probability of light-parton jets is approximately 1%; this working point corresponds to approximately 70% tagging efficiency per b jet. The effect of requiring more than one b-tagged jet has been investigated, particularly for the decay channels containing four or six b quark jets in the final state. It is found that this does not improve the search sensitivity, since the uncertainty in the estimation of background from data (as described in Section 6) becomes large.

The signal events are more spherical than the background events, which are largely characterized by the back-to-back topology of the jets from the hard-scattering 2\u21922 parton processes. This shape variable was previously used in the search for light-and heavy-flavor three-jet resonances [41], to separate the signal from the QCD background. The optimum selection on the sphericity value was determined by maximizing the expected signal significance, while keeping the selection soft enough to maintain the invariance of the H T distribution with respect to the jet multiplicity (explained in detail in Section 6), and corresponds to S > 0.1. Using the sphericity variable increases the expected signal significance by 10%.

The results are based on simultaneous counting experiments in the low-H T control region, dominated by the background, and in the signal region above a certain H T cutoff, optimized for each signal point, as discussed below. The main background in this analysis is QCD multijet production, which is estimated directly from the observed data using the H T multiplicity invariance method [45][46][47], extensively used for black hole searches in CMS. The method is based on an empirical observation that the shape of the H T spectrum is independent of the jet multiplicity, which was thoroughly checked by using various MC samples (pythia, alpgen, and Mad-Graph 5), as well as collision data. The invariance stems from the fact that, in a generic QCD event, the H T distribution is approximately determined by the 2 \u2192 2 hard-scattering processes. Any further splitting of jets as a result of FSR conserves the H T , as long as both the hard-scattering and FSR jets still pass the p T selection. The initial-state radiation, which is predominantly a forward process, does potentially change the H T value, but this turns out to be a subdominant effect and does not spoil the observed invariance. For the purpose of this analysis, we have also confirmed that the H T invariance is preserved with the relatively soft sphericity selection we use in the non-b-tagged analysis; it is also preserved when at least one b-tagged jet is required. The H T invariance method consists in fitting the shape of the H T distribution at lower jet multiplicities and then using this shape to describe the background for the high-multiplicity signal selection.",

The other fit functions and control samples are used to determine the background uncertainties, as described in Section 7. The f 3 function is used to fit to the 4-jet H T spectrum without any sphericity requirement as the background template for SR1 (coloron and axigluon A1 searches).

The control bin is chosen to be 1.4-1.7 TeV for SR1 and SR2, and 1.9-2.1 TeV for SR3 and SR4, where the lower boundary is chosen to avoid the multiplicity-related turn-on effects, and the upper boundary is chosen low enough to minimize signal contamination.

The signal bin is defined by the requirement of H T to exceed a certain threshold, which is determined for each resonance mass in each model to maximize the signal significance. For the case where the background expectation exceeds 20 events, the Gaussian significance S/ \u221a B is used, where S and B are signal and background expectations. For high-mass resonances, where the optimal H T thresholds are sufficiently high to have a small number of expected background events, the Z Bi criterion [85] is used instead.

In order to estimate the shape uncertainty, we use the envelope of the fits with five template functions to the H T spectrum in the 4-to 7-jet control samples in data. This uncertainty ranges from approximately 3% for H T = 1.4 TeV to 140% for H T = 4 TeV. The background normalization uncertainty is statistical in nature, because of the limited number of data events in the normalization region. It varies between 2 and 10%, depending on the signal region. The uncertainty related to the assumption of H T invariance is included in the shape uncertainty, as the fit function envelope contains fits to several exclusive low-multiplicity distributions, which allows one to gauge the degree to which the H T invariance may be violated. Systematic uncertainties in the signal acceptance are related to the choice of PDFs and the uncertainty in the jet energy scale. The PDF uncertainty is estimated using the PDF4LHC prescription [86,87], based on the CT10 [88], MSTW2008 [89], and NNPDF2.1 [90] sets and found to be 3%. The uncertainty due to the jet energy scale is estimated by varying the latter up and down by one standard deviation and estimating the effect on the signal acceptance after all the selections. This procedure gives a 5% uncertainty in the acceptance due to the uncertainty in the jet energy scale. In the case of signal models with b quark jets in the final state, there is an additional systematic uncertainty due to the uncertainty in the b tagging efficiency scale factors that account for the difference between the b tagging performance in data and in simulation [83]. This uncertainty is taken into account by varying the scale factor values up and down by one standard deviation and estimating the effect on the signal acceptance. The resulting uncertainty ranges between 2 and 5%, depending on H T . Finally, a 2.6% uncertainty in the integrated luminosity [91] is also applied to the signal yield.",

For limit setting, we use the asymptotic approximation [92] of the CL s method [93,94]. When comparing the result with theoretical cross sections to extract mass limits, we assume this branching fraction is equal to one, i.e. that the decay proceeds exclusively in the specific mode we probe, with the exception of the coloron model, where the branching fraction is calculated following Ref. [60], and typically exceeds 95%. Despite the potentially sizable signal contribution in the control bins, the sensitivity to the low-mass signals is still sufficiently high because of the large production cross section and the fact that the signal and background have different shapes; therefore, the fractional contributions of the signal in the control and signal bins are different. For the low-mass gluino (M g < 1.1 TeV), the sensitivity in the SR1/SR2 is actually higher than in the SR3/SR4, despite the presence of 10 jets in the final state resulting from the gluino decays, because the control bins in higher-multiplicity search regions SR3/SR4 suffer from potentially large signal contamination. The contamination is significantly less pronounced in the control bins of lower-multiplicity regions SR1/SR2, which also correspond to lower values of H T and are thus better separated from the signal. Nevertheless, the minimum H T requirement and the position of the control bins do not allow us to probe masses below 0.6 TeV, so all the results are quoted for signals with the masses above this threshold.",

The search is based on data from proton-proton collisions at \u221a s = 8 TeV corresponding to anintegrated luminosity of 19.7 fb \u22121 collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC. The scalar sum of the transverse momenta of the jets is used as a discriminating variable, with additional require-ments placed on event sphericity and b-tagged jet multiplicity. The dominant QCD multijet background is estimated from control samples at lower multiplicity, without any reliance on simulation. No significant deviation from the standard model background predictions has been observed. Upper limits at 95% confidence level on the cross section times branching fraction have been set for several signal scenarios. The cross section limits have been compared to specific coloron, axigluon, and gluino pair production cross sections. For the coloron and axigluon models, the lowest excluded mass is 0.6 TeV, while the highest excluded mass ranges from 0.75 to 1.15 TeV. For the RPV SUSY model, the lowest excluded mass is 0.6 TeV, while the highest excluded mass is 1.1 TeV.

The observed limit (black lines) is compared to the expected limit (red lines) with the one standard deviation theoretical uncertainty in the observed limit (black dashed lines) and the one standard deviation statistical and systematic uncertainties combined in the expected limits (red dashed lines). The gluino pair production cross sections are shown with the color scale.
