These decays proceed predominantly via a colour-suppressed b \u2192 ccs transition. Theoretically, such decays are often studied in the factorization approach [1,2]. It is predicted, in the absence of final-state interactions, that decays to spin-0 and 2 charmonium states are highly suppressed compared to decays to spin-1 states [1]. Experimentally, factorization has been observed to hold for B + \u2192 \u03c7 c1,c2 K + decays, 1 for which the Belle collaboration reported B(B + \u2192 \u03c7 c2 K + )/B(B + \u2192 \u03c7 c1 K + ) = (2.25 +0.73 \u22120.69 (stat)\u00b10.17 (syst))\u00d710 \u22122 [3].

The data corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 3.0 fb \u22121  collected at centre-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 TeV during 2011 and 2012, together with 1.9 fb \u22121 collected at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV during 2015 and 2016. This analysis focuses on the low K + K \u2212 mass region, where the B 0 s \u2192 \u03c7 cJ K + K \u2212 decay is expected to be dominated by the decay of an intermediate \u03c6 meson, as shown in figure 1. The same data set allows a measurement of the B 0 s mass with high precision due to the relatively small energy release. These studies build on the previous observation of the B 0 s \u2192 \u03c7 c1 \u03c6 mode [4].",

            "text": "The LHCb detector [7,8] is a single-arm forward spectrometer covering the pseudorapidity range 2 < \u03b7 < 5, designed for the study of particles containing b or c quarks. The detector includes a high-precision tracking system consisting of a silicon-strip vertex detector surrounding the pp interaction region [9], a large-area silicon-strip detector located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4 Tm, and three stations of siliconstrip detectors and straw drift tubes [10] placed downstream of the magnet. The tracking system provides a measurement of the momentum, p, of charged particles with a relative uncertainty that varies from 0.5% at low momentum to 1.0% at 200 GeV/c. The momentum scale is calibrated using samples of J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 and B + \u2192 J/\u03c8 K + decays collected concurrently with the data sample used for this analysis [11,12]. The relative accuracy of this procedure is estimated to be 3 \u00d7 10 \u22124 using samples of other fully reconstructed b-hadron, narrow-\u03a5 , and K 0 S decays. The minimum distance of a track to a primary vertex (PV), the impact parameter (IP), is measured with a resolution of (15 + 29/p T ) \u00b5m, where p T is the component of the momentum transverse to the beam, in GeV/c. Different types of charged hadrons are distinguished using information from two ringimaging Cherenkov (RICH) detectors. Photons, electrons and hadrons are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter and a hadronic calorimeter. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers [13].",

A kinematic fit is performed in which the candidate is constrained to point to this PV and the dimuon mass is constrained to the known value of the J/\u03c8 mass [24]. The reduced \u03c7 2 of this fit is required to be less than five. Combinatorial background is further reduced by requiring the decay time of the B 0 s candidate to be larger than 0.3 ps and its \u03c7 2 IP to be less than 20. Several vetoes are applied to remove background from fully reconstructed b-hadron decay modes. By combining kinematic and particle-identification information it is possible to impose requirements that are almost fully efficient for signal decays. The upper-mass sideband is found to be polluted by fully reconstructed b-hadron decays where a random photon is added. The most important of these is the B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c6 decay mode. This is removed by rejecting candidates in which the reconstructed J/\u03c8 K + K \u2212 invariant mass, calculated with a J/\u03c8 mass constraint, is within 18 MeV/c 2 (\u00b13\u03c3) of the known B 0 s mass [24]. A similar background is possible from the B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8 K + \u03c0 \u2212 decay mode where the pion is misidentified as a kaon. The candidate is rejected if either of the two possible J/\u03c8 K + \u03c0 \u2212 masses is within 18 MeV/c 2 of the known B 0 mass. These two requirements reject a negligible number of signal decays. Finally, candidates in which either of the kaons is consistent with being a proton (P p > P K ) are rejected if the reconstructed J/\u03c8 pK \u2212 mass is within 18 MeV/c 2 of the known \u039b 0 b mass. The efficiency of this veto is 99.3% for signal decays. Background from the \u039b 0 b \u2192 \u03c7 c1,c2 pK \u2212 decay mode peaks in the signal regions. Therefore, a veto is applied to each kaon candidate in turn. The candidate is rejected if the \u03c7 c1,c2 pK \u2212 mass is within 10 MeV/c 2 of the \u039b 0 b mass (a \u00b12\u03c3 window) and the proton well identified. After these requirements a broad signal is seen in the \u03c7 c1,c2 mass region and the B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03b3K + K \u2212 decay mode is observed (figure 2) above a large combinatorial background.",

As part of the systematic studies, the following alternative resolution models are also considered: Gaussian, sum of two Gaussians, double-sided Crystal Ball [30,31] and Bukin [32] functions. The advantage of factorizing the mass distribution in this way is that it leads to a model where all parameters can be fixed from physics considerations apart from an overall resolution scale factor, s f , that accounts for differences between data and simulation.

By default, combinatorial background is modelled by a first-order polynomial. Both a power law and an exponential function are considered as systematic variations. Partially reconstructed background from B 0 s \u2192 \u03c8(2S)K + K \u2212 decays, with the subsequent decay \u03c8(2S) \u2192 \u03c7 cJ \u03b3, is studied using RapidSim and the resulting template is added to the fit. The residual background from B 0 \u2192 \u03c7 c1,c2 K * (892) 0 and partially reconstructed B 0 \u2192 \u03c8(2S)K * (892) 0 decays is estimated to be 7 \u00b1 2 candidates and is included as a fixed component in the fit with the shape modelled using the simulation. Extended unbinned maximum likelihood fits are applied separately to the invariantmass distribution of selected candidates with either a \u03c7 c1 or \u03c7 c2 mass constraint applied. The former fit (refered to as the \u03c7 c1 K + K \u2212 fit) is used to make further cross-checks of the mass resolution and to determine the B 0 s mass. The latter (refered to as the \u03c7 c2 K + K \u2212 fit) is used to determine the yield of the B 0 s \u2192 \u03c7 c1,c2 K + K \u2212 components. The \u03c7 c1 K + K \u2212 fit has six free parameters: the B 0 s \u2192 \u03c7 c1 K + K \u2212 decay yield, N \u03c7 c1 , the B 0 s \u2192 \u03c7 c2 K + K \u2212 decay yield relative to that of the \u03c7 c1 mode, f , the B 0 s mass, m(B 0 s ), the yield of the partially reconstructed background, N part , the combinatorial background yield, N comb , and the slope of the combinatorial background. In addition, s f is allowed to vary within the Gaussian constraint of 1.00 \u00b1 0.05. The \u03c7 c2 K + K \u2212 fit has the same free parameters apart from m(B 0 s ), which is fixed to its known value [24]. The fit procedure is validated using both the full simulation and pseudoexperiments which are fits to simulated distributions generated according to the density functions described above and using the yields from the fit to the data. No significant bias is found and the uncertainties estimated by the fit agree with the results of the pseudoexperiments.",

The detector resolution of 0.9 MeV/c 2 is accounted for by convolving the resonance lineshape with a Gaussian distribution.

The LHCb results are combined, taking the statistical uncertainties and those related to the fit procedure to be uncorrelated and those due to the detector material budget and K + mass to be fully correlated. The uncertainty due to the momentum scale in ref. [38] is also taken to be fully correlated, whereas in ref. [37] a different procedure was used and so the corresponding uncertainty is considered to be uncorrelated with the other measurements.
