The flux-integrated CCQE cross section was measured to be h\u03c3i \u00bc \u00f00.83 AE 0.12\u00de \u00d7 10 \u221238 cm 2 . The energy dependence of the CCQE cross section is also reported. The axial mass, M QE A , of the dipole axial form factor was extracted assuming the Smith-Moniz CCQE model with a relativistic Fermi gas nuclear model. Using the absolute (shape-only) p \u03bc -cos \u03b8 \u03bc distribution, the effective M QE A parameter was measured to be 1.26 \u00fe0.21 \u22120.18 GeV=c 2 (1.43 \u00fe0.28 \u22120.22 GeV=c 2 ).",

            "text": "The charged-current quasielastic (CCQE) interaction, \u03bd l \u00fe n \u2192 l \u2212 \u00fe p, is the dominant CC process for neutrino-nucleon interactions at E \u03bd \u223c 1 GeV and contributes to the total cross section in the neutrino energy range relevant for current accelerator-based long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments. The CCQE interaction of a neutrino with a nucleon is a two-body interaction, and hence the initial neutrino energy can be estimated from relatively well-measured final state lepton kinematics without relying on reconstruction and energy measurement of the hadronic final state. As the neutrino oscillation probability depends on the neutrino energy, the energy dependence of the CCQE cross section is critically important. This interaction has been modeled with the Llewellyn Smith [1] (Smith-Moniz [2,3]) formalism for CCQE interactions on nucleons (nuclei). Assuming a dipole axial vector form factor, there is only one free parameter to be fixed by neutrino experiments, the axial mass, M QE A . This CCQE model is described in detail in Sec. V.",

The MINERvA experiment reports excess vertex activity in CCQE data which may also indicate the presence of multinucleon processes [10]. Recent theoretical developments are reviewed in [11,12]. Such additional processes not only contribute to the measured total cross section but also can affect the neutrino energy reconstruction. These new models have had success in describing MiniBooNE CCQE data [13][14][15][16][17] and T2K CC data [18][19][20][21][22].

The proton beam energy is 30 GeV, and each beam spill consists of up to eight bunches 15 ns in width with 581 ns spacing between bunches. The spill cycle has a frequency of 0.3-0.4 Hz. The proton beam impacts a graphite target where hadronic interactions produce mostly pions and kaons. Charged particles are focused by three magnetic horns and enter the decay tunnel where they decay to produce the neutrino beam. For the data presented here, the horns are operated in neutrino mode to focus \u03c0 \u00fe for a high purity \u03bd \u03bc beam. A beam dump at the end of the decay tunnel stops non-neutrino particles from reaching the near detectors. Muon monitors beyond the beam dump are used to monitor the beam intensity and direction. An underground experiment hall containing near detectors designed to characterize the neutrino beam is located 280 m from the target. The on-axis near detector, INGRID, consists of an array of modules that measure the beam direction and profile. The ND280 near detector used for this analysis lies 2.5\u00b0off the beam axis. This analysis is based on 2.6 \u00d7 10 20 protons on target (POT) using data collected by the ND280 detector during the first three T2K running periods (spanning the period January 2010-June 2012).",

The detector sits inside the refurbished UA1 magnet which provides a 0.2 T magnetic field for track sign selection and momentum measurement. The detector is divided into two regions: a tracker and an upstream \u03c0 0 detector region (P0D) [34]. A diagram of the ND280 detector is shown in Fig. 2. This analysis uses events reconstructed in the ND280 tracker. The tracker region contains two fine grained detectors (FGDs) and three time projection chambers (TPCs). Surrounding both the P0D and tracker regions are electromagnetic calorimeters (ECals). The magnet is instrumented with a scintillator called the side muon range detector (SMRD) which detects muons escaping with high angles with respect to the beam direction. The first fine grained detector (FGD1) [35] provides target mass and track reconstruction near the interaction vertex. It consists of layers of 9.6 mm \u00d7 9.6 mm \u00d7 1864.3 mm plastic scintillator bars read out with wavelength shifting fibers into multipixel photon counters. There are 30 layers with each layer containing 192 bars. The orientation of the layers alternates between x and y directions perpendicular to the neutrino beam. This allows for three-dimensional reconstruction of the interaction vertex. The target nuclei are predominantly carbon with small fractions of other nuclei.

The electromagnetic form factors are precisely measured in electron elastic scattering experiments. The vector form factors of the weak nucleon current are related to the electromagnetic form factors through the conserved vector current hypothesis. Two form factors remain: the axial vector form factor, F A , and the pseudoscalar form factor. The pseudoscalar form factor can be related to the axial form factor. This leaves F A as the only independent freeform factor. A dipole form is assumed for F A ,",

In the cascade model hadrons are treated as classical objects undergoing a sequence of independent collisions as they move through the nucleus. This is implemented as an independent step after the initial neutrino-nucleon scattering that has the effect of altering the observed hadronic final state. In the cascade model, a vertex position within the nucleus is selected from a Wood-Saxon nucleon density distribution. Each hadron produced in the interaction is stepped through the nucleus. At each step a Monte Carlo method is used to determine if an interaction occurs. If an interaction occurs, FSI is applied to the outgoing hadrons. This process is repeated until all hadrons escape the nucleus or are absorbed. For pions, three interactions may occur: inelastic scattering, absorption, and charge exchange. The probabilities of these interactions depend on the pion momentum and position within the nucleus and are constrained by external pionnucleus scattering measurements . Elastic scattering is neglected as it is mostly forward going with negligible momentum change.",

These uncertainties are propagated to the T2K neutrino beam flux prediction by reweighting FLUKA2008 MC samples. The total -proton-nucleus production cross section uncertainty is set to cover discrepancies between NA61 measurements [30] and other external data sets [68][69][70].

This is investigated by examining the hits distributions of through-going muons that are known from the TPC measurement to pass through every layer of the FGD. An additional 20% cross section uncertainty is applied to the out-of-FGD events as they come primarily from interactions on heavier nuclei. This is motivated by comparison of the out-of-FGD rates predicted by the NEUT and GENIE event generators as well as comparisons between the data and MC event rates in the SMRD, ECal, and P0D detectors.

The uncertainty on the CCQE cross section is estimated with the constant \u0394 ln \u03bb method. Studies with pseudodata generated from the MC model found that this method is unbiased and gives frequentist coverage. To avoid experimenter bias, a blind analysis was performed. The analysis method was developed and validated with toy Monte Carlo studies before being applied to the data. Figure 6 shows the observed p \u03bc -cos \u03b8 \u03bc distribution before and after the fit. Figure 7 shows the best-fit CCQE cross section. The best fit to the ND280 data prefers a lower overall cross section than the model prediction. In gives a good description of the data. One exception is the measurement in the range 1-1.5 GeV which differs from the model prediction at the level of 2.3\u03c3 in that bin. However, this discrepancy is not statistically significant. A \u03c7 2 test comparing the fitted result with the nominal model prediction gives a p-value of 17% indicating agreement between the data and the cross section model. This is compared with measurements from other experiments in Fig. 8. There is consistency between the experiments within the current statistical and systematic uncertainties. At low E \u03bd the uncertainties are comparable with other experiments. At high E \u03bd the uncertainties increase where there is increased contamination from background processes and larger flux uncertainties. The total fractional covariance matrix is given in Table VIII. These data may be useful to compare with alternative models; however, care should be taken to account for the model assumptions made in the extrapolation from p \u03bc -cos \u03b8 \u03bc to E \u03bd .",

The choice to use the postfit nominal values as opposed to their fitted values has a negligible effect on the final h\u03c3i.

A multivariate Gaussian probability density function was constructed using the best-fit w jk and f j parameter values and the postfit covariance matrix.

While higher values are preferred when using shape only, it should be noted that these results are consistent within their current uncertainties. As discussed in Sec.

The model gives a good description of the data within the current level of statistical and systematic uncertainty. The flux-integrated CCQE cross section was measured to be h\u03c3i \u00bc \u00f00.83 AE 0.12\u00de \u00d7 10 \u221238 cm 2 in good agreement with the nominal model value of 0.88 \u00d7 10 \u221238 cm 2 (evaluated at M QE A \u00bc 1.21 GeV=c 2 ). We have extracted the energy-dependent CCQE cross section. Understanding this dependence is crucial for current and future neutrino oscillation experiments. Both results are consistent with an enhanced cross section relative to a model with M QE A \u00bc 1.03 GeV=c 2 (or equivalently this is consistent with a high effective M QE A ). A direct extraction of M QE A yields 1.26 \u00fe0.21 \u22120.18 GeV=c 2 when using normalization plus shape information and 1.43 \u00fe0. 28 \u22120.22 GeV=c 2 when using only shape information. This observation is consistent with that observed by other experiments at similar energies; however, at the current level of uncertainty we are unable to resolve the discrepancies between NOMAD and MiniBooNE data sets. The generators used by the T2K experiment are being actively developed. Future analyses will include multinucleon effects and more advanced nuclear models. In addition, future T2K CCQE analyses will produce a model independent measurement of the flux integrated differential cross section for QE-like processes as a function of muon kinematics.",
