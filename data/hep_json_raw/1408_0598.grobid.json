There are several models from which one can extract cross sections and kinematical predictions for this interaction. The Rein-Seghal [1] model has been used to successfully describe high energy data within experimental uncertainties since the first observation of coherent pion production at the Aachen-Padova spark chamber [2] in 1983. This approach is based on Adler's Partially Conserved Axial Current (PCAC) theorem [3], which relates the pion production cross section to the cross section for the pion-nucleus scattering. This model is still the standard for neutrino generators today, such as genie [4], NuWro [5], and neut [6], with continued updates to the formalism and the pion-nucleus scattering data that is used. With recent interest in coherent pion production in the theoretical community, other PCAC models have been proposed [7,8]. Microscopic models [9][10][11] have also been suggested, which employ a full quantum mechanical treatment that explores the excitation and decay of the \u2206 resonance. While the PCAC based models are a simple approach, tailored for the description of high energy data, their extension to the few GeV regime is not straightforward. Notably, the K2K [12] and SciBooNE [13] collaborations found cross section upper limits for the CC coherent pion production well below Rein-Seghal's estimation. The microscopic models are better moti-vated at lower neutrino energies but currently cannot be used to describe high energy data. Given the differences in these models, more experimental measurements are necessary to validate and tune the models and, in particular, better understand the transition region between microscopic and PCAC validity at",

ArgoNeuT [14] is a 170 L liquid argon time projection chamber (LArTPC), with dimensions 47 \u00d7 40 \u00d7 90 cm 3 . The electric field inside the TPC is 481 V/cm, and the drifted charge from particle interactions is read out in two planes of 240 wires with 4 mm pitch (the induction and collection planes). The angle between the induction and collection plane wires is 60 degrees. ArgoNeuT is exposed to the NuMI beam [15] set in an antineutrinoenhanced mode, which provides a flux that is mostly muon antineutrino but still rich in muon neutrinos. The total number of protons on target (POT) accumulated during a 5-month run is 1.2 \u00d7 10 20 and the estimated integrated fluxes are 6.6 \u00d7 10 11 muon neutrinos per cm 2 and 3.0\u00d710 12 muon antineutrinos per cm 2 . The differential flux can be found in reference [16]. Neutrino interactions comprise almost 60% of all the neutrino/antineutrinoinduced events in the detector [16]. During this run, the MINOS near detector [17] placed downstream of ArgoNeuT is also operational. The muons that exit ArgoNeuT's TPC volume are matched to MINOS, in which the momentum and charge are reconstructed.",

The calorimetry capabilities of the detector are further exploited by investigating the Analog-to-Digital (ADC) readout at the wires at the vertex.

This approach is not feasible because most pions are not contained in the ArgoNeuT TPC so their momentum can't be estimated. Instead, we achieve signal from background separation by applying a multivariate method which exploits the topological and calorimetric information reconstructed in each event. The ROOT Toolkit for Multivariate Analysis [21] was used to create a Boosted Decision Tree (BDT) which is trained using genie signal and background samples. The classification is based on the angles of the pion and muon tracks, the visible energy loss of the pion from the TPC's calorimetry, the reconstructed muon momentum from MINOS and the mean stopping power of the first third of the muon track. The last of these parameters was added to help distinguish events where the start of the muon and pion tracks is overlapping. The angular parameters have the highest discrimination power.

Reconstruction effects have their impact estimated by adjusting the reconstructed values by \u00b11\u03c3, where \u03c3 is the uncertainty on the reconstructed parameter. The absolute muon momentum estimated from the track curvature in the MINOS detector has a 4% systematic uncertainty [22] and the angular uncertainty assigned to tracks reconstructed in ArgoNeuT is 1 \u2022 [23]. The contribution of background uncertainties is found by adjusting the contribution from each individual background process by \u00b120% [24]. The rate at which the charge of the muon is misidentified is also estimated and treated like the other backgrounds, though its contribution was found to be negligible. The effect of nuclear interactions affecting the production of background events is also considered. This is done by evaluating the fraction of background events added by final state interactions and re-weighting this sample by a conservative factor (\u00b120%). Finally, the systematic error associated with the signal modeling is investigated by generating a signal template using NuWro. The difference in the number of signal events found after repeating the fit is our estimation of the systematic uncertainty. The flux-averaged cross section is found by dividing the number of signal events by the efficiency of the selection, the number of target nuclei in the fiducial volume and the integrated (anti)neutrino flux.

This is also the first time that machine learning techniques have been applied to LArTPC data analysis. The large uncertainties on the final cross section values are dominated by the statistical errors. Using the precise calorimetry and the high resolution of the interaction vertex which are fundamental for this analysis, future LArTPC experiments will be able to provide decisive measurements for the understanding of neutrino induced coherent pion production.",
