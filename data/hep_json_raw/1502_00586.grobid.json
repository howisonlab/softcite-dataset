The data set used corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 4.59 fb \u22121 of proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV recorded by the ATLAS detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. In total, 140 and 222 tt\u03b3 candidate events are observed in the electron and muon channels, to be compared to the expectation of 79 AE 26 and 120 AE 39 non-tt\u03b3 background events, respectively. The production of tt\u03b3 events is observed with a significance of 5.3 standard deviations away from the null hypothesis. The tt\u03b3 production cross section times the branching ratio (BR) of the single-lepton decay channel is measured in a fiducial kinematic region within the ATLAS acceptance. The measured value is \u03c3 fid tt\u03b3 \u00d7 BR \u00bc 63 AE 8\u00f0stat\u00de \u00fe17 \u221213 \u00f0syst\u00de AE 1\u00f0lumi\u00de fb per lepton flavor, in good agreement with the leadingorder theoretical calculation normalized to the next-to-leading-order theoretical prediction of 48 AE 10 fb.",

            "text": "Due to its large mass, the top quark is speculated to play a special role in electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB). New physics connected with EWSB can manifest itself in top-quark observables. For instance, top-quark couplings can be modified significantly in some extensions of the Standard Model (SM). A measured yield of top-quark pair production in association with a photon (tt\u03b3) can constrain models of new physics, for example those with composite top quarks [1], or with excited top-quark production, followed by the radiative decay t \u00c3 \u2192 t\u03b3. The tt\u03b3 coupling may be determined via an analysis of direct production of top-quark pairs in association with a photon, evidence of which was first reported [2] by the CDF Collaboration.",

The NLO QCD calculation of top-quark pair production in association with a hard photon is detailed in Sec. A 2. The systematic uncertainty on the NLO cross section is obtained by simultaneous renormalization and factorization scale variations by a factor of two (m t =2 and 2m t ) around the central value (m t ), and is calculated to be 20% [18]. The NLO/LO correction (K-factor) calculation is performed in a phasespace region close to the one defined by the analysis kinematic selection criteria (see Sec. A 2 for details). The dependence of the K factor on the kinematic variables is small compared to the scale uncertainty [18]. The effect of the variations of photon radiation settings in MADGRAPH is studied using a sample generated with a minimum separation in \u03b7-\u03d5 space between the photon and any other particle of \u0394R > 0.05 2 instead of \u0394R > 0.2 used in the default sample (see Sec.

The p T threshold for the muon trigger is 18 GeV, the thresholds for the electron trigger are 20 or 22 GeV, depending on the datataking period due to changing LHC luminosity conditions. The event reconstruction makes use of kinematic variables such as transverse momentum (p T ), energy in the transverse plane (E T ) and pseudorapidity (\u03b7) of photons, leptons (e and \u03bc) and jets (j) as well as b-tagging information, and missing transverse momentum (E miss T ). The selected events are required to contain a reconstructed primary vertex with at least five associated tracks, each with p T > 0.4 GeV. The primary vertex is chosen as the vertex with the highest P p 2 T over all associated tracks. Photons are required to have E T > 20 GeV and j\u03b7j < 2.37, excluding the transition region between the barrel and end-cap calorimeters at 1.37 < j\u03b7j < 1.52, and must satisfy tight identification criteria [38,39]. Specifically, requirements on the electromagnetic shower shapes [40] are applied to suppress the background from hadron decays (e.g. \u03c0 0 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 decay leads to two overlapping showers as opposed to a single shower produced by a prompt photon).",

To estimate the systematic uncertainty due to the amount of prompt-photon contamination in the background template (as described in Sec. VI C), the corresponding nuisance parameter \u03b1 fake is sampled using a Gaussian pdf with a width of \u03c3 \u03b1 fake \u00bc 28% corresponding to its estimated uncertainty.

This uncertainty includes a comparison of MADGRAPH with WHIZARD (1.7%), as well as a comparison of the MADGRAPH tt\u03b3 samples with different QED FSR settings (3.4%) as explained in Sec. III. The renormalization and factorization scales are also varied, leading to an uncertainty of 1.1%. To assess the effect of different parton shower models, predictions from the MadGraph \u00fe HERWIG sample are compared to predictions from the MadGraph \u00fe PYTHIA sample, leading to an uncertainty of 7.3%. In addition, studies of tt samples with varied color reconnection (0.2%) and underlying event (0.9%) settings lead to small contributions. The uncertainty associated with the choice of the CTEQ6L1 PDF set is evaluated from an envelope of calculations using the PDF4LHC prescription [66] by reweighting the CTEQ6L1 LO PDF used in the generation of the tt\u03b3 WHIZARD sample with MSTW2008 [67,68], CT10 [34,69] and NNPDF2.0 [70] NLO PDF sets and amounts to 1.1%.
