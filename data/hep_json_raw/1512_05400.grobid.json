Gluon-gluon and quark-gluon scattering dominate jet production in proton-proton collisions at RHIC, so the longitudinal double-spin asymmetry, A LL , for jet production places significant constraints on the gluon polarization in the proton. In recent years STAR has recorded large longitudinally polarized pp data sets at both \u221a s = 200 GeV and 510 GeV. The 2009 STAR inclusive jet A LL measurements at \u221a s = 200 GeV show the first experimental evidence of non-zero gluon polarization over the Bjorken-x range, x > 0.05. Furthermore, data collected at \u221a s = 510",

The inclusive jet A LL from 2006 data 12 excludes a number of theoretical scenarios that predict large gluon polarization in the accessible x range. The DSSV model, the first global analysis with STAR 2006 inclusive jet A LL included, found a relatively small gluon contribution to the proton spin at the x region where 2006 STAR data reside, 0.05 < x < 0.2. 6 In 2009, STAR collected nearly a 20 fold increase in event statistics of 200 GeV pp data compared to the 2006 200 GeV data. In addition, the anti-k T algorithm with jet resolution parameter R = 0.6 was used to reconstruct jets. The anti-k T algorithm is less susceptible to diffuse soft backgrounds from underlying event and pile-up effects compared to the mid-point cone algorithm. 16 A change in the treatment of hadronic energy depositions in the BEMC and EEMC led to an improvement in the  jet momentum resolution from 23% to 18%. The statistical error bars of the 2009 results are at least a factor of four smaller than those of the 2006 results at low jet p T and a factor of three smaller at high jet p T . As shown in Fig. 1, 17 the A LL results fall among several recent model predictions. [3][4][5][6] The A LL measurements fall above the old DSSV prediction but well within the previous quoted uncertainty. The recently released DSSV'14 results with the 2009 data give \u2206G = 0.19 +0.06 \u22120.05 for x > 0.05 at 90% confidence limit. 2 The NNPDF group has also included the 2009 results into their fits. They find \u2206G = 0.23 \u00b1 0.07 at 0.05 < x < 0.5 together with a significantly reduced uncertainty band on x\u2206g(x). 5 In 2012, STAR performed the first measurements of inclusive jet A LL in 510 GeV pp collisions. The anti-k T algorithm with jet resolution parameter R = 0.5 was used to reconstruct jets. The smaller jet resolution parameter 0.5 features reduced backgrounds from underlying event and pile-up effects and better matching probabilities from detector jets to parton jets. The parton jet p T uncertainty is dominated by the total BEMC energy uncertainty. The dominant systematics in the 2012 A LL arise from trigger and reconstruction biases, which were estimated with the Monte Carlo simulations.
