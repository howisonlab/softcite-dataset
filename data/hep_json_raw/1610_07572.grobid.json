The data was taken between 2010 and 2012. Limits on anomalous triple gauge couplings (aTGCs) then follow. In addition, data on electroweak triple gauge boson production and 2-to-2 vector boson scattering (VBS) yield limits on anomalous quartic gauge boson couplings (aQGCs). The LHC hosts two general purpose experiments, ATLAS and CMS, which both have reported limits on aTGCs and aQGCs which are herein summarized. The interpretation of these limits in terms of an effective field theory (EFT) is reviewed, and recommendations are made for testing other types of new physics using multi-gauge boson production.",

In Section III a brief description of the relevant experimental issues is given with references for the corresponding experimental aspects of the ATLAS and CMS experiments. In Section IV the published LHC diboson studies are presented while in Section V the triboson results are shown. In Section VI the vector boson fusion (VBF) data for W and Z bosons are shown as a proof of principle that this electroweak process can be extracted from the experimental backgrounds. Armed with those analyses, the data on VBS is presented in Section VII. The existing limits on gauge couplings are collected in Section VIII for aTGC and IX for aQGC. Finally, Section X explores the prospects for gauge coupling studies with the increased luminosity planned for the LHC as set out by CERN.",

Even more important is the connection between the study of multiple EW gauge bosons and the structure of ElectroWeak Symmetry Breaking (EWSB).",

Well before the discovery of the Higgs, it was known that the scattering of massive vector bosons without a Higgs-like state has amplitudes that grow as \u223c E 2 . Naively, if the SM EW gauge bosons were scattered at energies \u223c 4\u03c0m W /g, tree-level unitarity would appear to be violated. Of course this did not mean that unitarity actually would have been violated, it simply meant that the theory of EWSB and massive gauge bosons would become strongly coupled and unpredictive at these scales. If the Higgs existed, the growth with energy would be canceled by the Higgs contribution, and perturbative unitarity would have been manifest and calculable within this framework. To test VBS, the simplest process one can study experimentally is shown in Figure 2. As in the case of aTGCs, the proposal to use VBS to test EWSB preceded the experimental observation of a Higgs boson. At that point there were promising alternatives to the ad hoc Higgs mechanism which could explain EWSB dynamically, such as Technicolor (Farhi and Susskind, 1981) and composite Higgs models (Kaplan and Georgi, 1984). In these models unitarity was not violated either:",

Since the discovery of a Higgs-like state, the direct connection to perturbative unitarity studies has been reduced, nevertheless it will be an important validation of the SM to show the effects of the Higgs on vector boson scattering at the LHC. Additionally, there could still be small deviations in the EWSB that would manifest themselves in VBF or VBS either as obvious deviations in the differential cross section or in searches for aTGCs or aQGCs in these channels.",

However, with the advancement of knowledge from LEP, the Tevatron and the LHC it is important to understand their failings in our modern understanding of the SM including the Higgs. In Section II.B we will review the breakdown of historical methods for studying multiple production of EW gauge bosons. These methods are however still used today, including in the experimental sections of this review. We will also discuss how attempts to improve on testing for deviations in coupling constants have been done through EFT methods. This is a useful tool to understand where to look for deviations in experimental results and how to parametrize them, but only if used correctly. We will attempt to delineate these efforts both theoretically and experimentally, as there are failings on both sides with respect to the application of EFTs for multi-gauge boson production. In Section II.B.2 we discuss the important role of multi-gauge boson production in searches for BSM physics which has no connection to EFTs whatsoever. This is an important and often overlooked or factorized result given the structure of the ATLAS and CMS collaborations, which typically relegate these processes to BSM groups that try to avoid regions of SM-like kinematics, or use them as control regions. Nevertheless, the relation that massive gauge bosons have to EWSB dictates that searches for BSM in SM EW-like kinematic regions are as important as any other topic in studying multi-gauge boson production in the SM.",

In addition, to go beyond the first implications of the Higgs and delve into possibilities for EWSB, the Higgs itself has become inextricably intertwined in current and future predictions for the LHC.

In particular, in 2005 there was an \"experimentalists NLO wish-list\" developed at Les Houches (Buttar et al., 2006) for many processes relevant for the LHC. Since then, this wish-list has essentially been completed, and now MC programs are available to calculate at NLO in QCD automatically.

More generally an exclusive measurement is made in different jet-multiplicities. In this case jet-veto resummation is also needed since there is a large difference of scales between the jet-veto scale and the invariant mass of the diboson system. In fact, not including this effect led to early measurements of the W + W \u2212 cross section being significantly overestimated when experiments extrapolated from fiducial to inclusive measurements. The effect of the jet-veto is also correlated with p T resummation and its impact on extrapolating to the total cross section was first pointed out for p T resummation in (Meade et al., 2014) and for jet-veto resummation in (Jaiswal and Okui, 2014). These results naively disagreed, but after taking into account scale choices and adopting a uniform approach, they agreed at NLO+NNLL (Jaiswal et al., 2016). Currently the state of the art for jet-veto resummation for this channel is NNLO+NNLL as performed in (Dawson et al., 2016). This slightly reduces the effect of the jet-veto on the total cross section compared to NLO+NNLL. Additionally one must include the NLO effects of gg \u2192 V V in the calculation, as was done in (Caola et al., 2016) where it was shown to be large, but this needs to be resummed as well. Hopefully a more complete theoretical picture for this channel will be developed in the next few years and the same level of scrutiny will be applied to all diboson channels simultaneously.",

            "text": "The reason for this proliferation of models was that the Higgs mechanism in the SM has EWSB put in by hand and cannot explain why the symmetry is broken. Additionally the Higgs mechanism on its own suffers from extreme fine-tuning unless new physics occurs around the TeV scale. Models such as Technicolor (Susskind, 1979;Weinberg, 1976) where EWSB occurs dynamically, and similarly to other examples of spontaneous symmetry breaking in nature, offered an attractive alternative. In the extreme case of strongly coupled EWSB such as Technicolor, or other incarnations of Higgsless models (Csaki et al., 2004a,b), there is no Higgs field and the extra-modes required for gauge-invariance come from the \"pions\" of a larger broken symmetry. There are also models of strongly coupled EWSB which include a mode that resembles the SM Higgs, but the Higgs is also a pseudo Goldstone boson of a larger symmetry, for instance in composite Higgs (Georgi and Kaplan, 1984) or little Higgs models (Arkani-Hamed et al., 2002, 2001. In both of these cases, gauge invariance is parametrized through a non-linear representation of the modes, similar to one used for chiral Lagrangians that describe the breaking of global symmetries in QCD. In weakly coupled models with fundamental scalar fields, e.g. the Minimal Supersymmetric SM (MSSM), there is a Higgs field that can be used directly to make gauge invariant contributions to aTGCs, and is often described in the literature as a linear representation. Regardless of the choice of \"new physics\" parametrization (or even simply the Higgs itself) that restores gauge-invariance for aTGCs, accounting for deviations such as those parametrized in (1) requires the introduction of new physics beyond the SM. However, the parametrization does have implications for the size of deviations expected and the interpretation of experimental results. Once a Higgs boson was discovered (and there were many hints for this from prior EW precision tests that this would be true), a linear representation is highly favored and makes any other starting point almost as contrived as assuming SU (2) \u00d7 U (1) is not a good symmetry. This of course does not preclude the fact that the Higgs could be a composite from dynamical symmetry breaking, but it does restrict the form of corrections, as we will see.",

In fact through \u2206 = 6 all operators are known and have been reduced from a general set (Buchmuller and Wyler, 1986) to an irreducible basis (Grzadkowski et al., 2010). Given that there is only one gauge invariant operator at dimension 5, the SM neutrino mass operator, the dominant effects of new physics describable by an EFT occur at \u2206 = 6 unless they are forbidden by an additional symmetry assumption. Given that the EFT includes within it all the symmetries of the SM, this serves as the best starting point for describing small deviations to the SM from physics occurring at higher mass scales. We will describe these EFT methods in more detail in Section II.B.1, their relation to previous aTGC studies and where they should and should not be used. It is important to note though that an EFT manifestly does not describe physics at a scale \u039b accessible to the LHC. Given that one of the most important reasons for studying multiple EW gauge boson production is its strong coupling to the EWSB sector, the possibility that there may be new physics at the EW scale that affects these measurements is a logical possibility. In fact in almost any model of new physics that explains EWSB naturally, there are new particles near the EW scale with EW quantum numbers that would contaminate the same final states used for the measurements of cross sections. The EFT formalism cannot be used for this possibility, and currently there is almost no experimental effort in this direction where the kinematics are very SM-like. In Section II.B.2 we discuss some possible uses of multi-gauge bosons to search for new physics in this region and to test the SM in ways other than what is utilized by EFT, aTGC, aQGC and vector boson scattering measurements.",

As mentioned earlier, this is not a truly model independent description of all new physics -for instance those with a scale directly accessible at an experiment cannot be analyzed effectively in this manner. However, it is a very useful description for those models which are well described through an EFT. Given a model that is well described through an EFT one can then perform a matching calculation of Wilson coefficients in the full model and EFT to set bounds on all such applicable models. In particular this formalism can describe both \"linear\" representations for BSM and non-linear representations that are still viable when the compositeness scale is large. For example in the Strongly Interacting Light Higgs (SILH) model (Giudice et al., 2007) if the scale of composite resonances m * is well above the scale we have currently probed, the standard non-linear representation can be expanded and matched onto the EFT description. In Section II.B.3 a list of all EFT operators and conventions typically used will be given, as well as their relation to anomalous couplings (a more extensive discussion can be found in (Degrande et al., 2013b)). Before going into the conventions, it is important to understand that despite EFTs being a well motivated framework that can apply to many different models, there are also drawbacks depending on how they are used experimentally and theoretically.

This is different from the motivations based on tree-level unitarity violation in vector boson scattering studies back when the nature of EWSB was unknown (although the concept of unitarity violation is just as meaningless there once understood properly as strong coupling). Unitarity violation from the SM EFT is completely unphysical and simply reflects an incorrect use of an EFT. Apparent unitarity violation is simply just another guise for the EFT becoming strongly coupled and unable to make predictions. This point is theoretically well understood, however, experiments still refer to unitarization methods when they use an EFT framework for multi-gauge boson measurements (due to these inconsistent limits (E/\u039b) \u2206 i \u22124 1 and (E/\u039b) \u2206 i \u22124 \u223c 1 for setting the most powerful bounds).

Therefore, one must ask whether the operators used in Equation 9correspond to theories in which the EFT description is valid, or whether the increased sensitivity is an artifact of the high p T tail of the EFT. For example, one potentially viable model with alternative EWSB is the SILH model. In this model there are two parameters which describe the new physics, a coupling g * and a mass scale m * . As with any model, a matching calculation to a SM EFT can be performed, leading to specific predictions for the Wilson coefficients. In this case there are different power countings of couplings and masses for the different operators of Equation 9, and when the one-dimensional bounds on the operators in (Butter et al., 2016) are recast in terms of the m * and g * one reaches a contradiction.

In this section we demonstrate examples where SM measurements can provide powerful discriminating power for BSM physics even when the EFT description is invalid.

The W + W \u2212 cross section as measured by ATLAS and CMS was systematically higher than the predicted NLO cross section at both 7 and 8 TeV. This eventually led to the theoretical developments involving higher fixed order calculations as well as higher order resummed calculations that brought theory into good agreement with the measurements (see (Dawson et al., 2016) for the state of the art which still is slightly low compared to the measured value when jet-veto resummation effects are theoretically included). However, an intriguing possibility before the higher order SM calculations were available, was that this could have also been caused by a new BSM contribution to the W + W \u2212 cross section measurement. An example of this was provided in (Curtin et al., 2013a) where the supersymmetric (SUSY) pair-production of Charginos would lead to a final state pp \u2192 \u03c7 + \u03c7 \u2212 \u2192 W + W \u2212 \u03c7 0 \u03c7 0 , with the same l + l \u2212 + missing transverse energy (MET) final state. Typically such a process is sought in direct SUSY searches, but if the spectrum is such that the kinematics is similar to that of the SM background it is very difficult to disentangle and could be missed. Kinematics in a SUSY process similar to multiboson final states naturally arises if EW BSM states are similar to the EW scale. However, this also holds true if the mass splittings between the initially produced states and their decay products are similar to the EW scale. In (Curtin et al., 2013b) it was realized that the W + W \u2212 cross section measurement itself could be used to bound a number of these scenarios. In particular, by using this measurement the first bounds on right-handed (RH)",

However, it avoids the interpretation issues for the experiments on the validity of EFTs, aTGCs, or aQGCs. In particular, the theoretical statement of when a certain model or approach is theoretically valid resides with the theorists. Additionally, it allows for the direct comparison with models that are not describable in the theoretical approaches implemented by the experimental groups, for instance the W + W \u2212 example given earlier. Furthermore, by reducing the time spent on theoretical interpretation, it allows for more \"signal\" regions to be investigated. We emphasize that this is not what has been done at the LHC when moving from EFTs of Dark Matter (DM) (Fox et al., 2012) to Simplified Models (Abdallah et al., 2015) because of concerns with the EFT approach. In the case of DM at the LHC, it was realized that having an EFT description of DM was often not valid due to the unitary/strong coupling or Wilson coefficient and power counting arguments and another approach was needed. To couple DM to SM charged particles generically requires new physics that is charged under the SM gauge symmetry which we call messenger particles (there are notable exceptions but this is quite common). Therefore it is typically more straightforward and theoretically consistent to search for these messenger particles directly, rather than searching for EFT operators via radiative processes such as mono-jets that may not be self-consistent. For example, this is why SUSY bounds on neutralinos were never set via direct production of neutralinos tagged from an initial-state radiation jet. In principle one could attempt to identify simplified models for EW processes relevant for multi-boson physics as an alternative to EFTs. However, there are always drawbacks to simplified models as well, and searches in BSM experimental groups typically are not nearly as sophisticated in the SM theory prediction as for a SM measurement. Rather than duplicate effort that may exist elsewhere and run into issues of theoretical interpretations such as whether or not simplified models provide sufficient coverage, it is much more useful and direct to have the SM groups of ATLAS and CMS provide upper limits on fiducial cross sections. This does not have to be motivated solely from the BSM perspective. Having more differential distributions in fiducial regions that are well understood by the experiments can point to where more SM theoretical effort is needed e.g.",

As discussed, the operators of interest are those that include gauge fields and are of dimension \u2206 i = 6 or possibly \u2206 i = 8. The \u2206 i = 6 are the most important operators when the EFT is valid unless there is a systematic power counting due to a particular UV interpretation that would suppress the dimensionless Wilson coefficients (Arzt et al., 1995;Liu et al., 2016). At \u2206 i = 6 there are already 59 operators in the SM (Buchmuller and Wyler, 1986;Grzadkowski et al., 2010), while for \u2206 i = 8 an exhaustive list of 535 operators was finally classified in (Lehman and Martin, 2016). While there are slight differences in number of operators at a fixed dimension in the literature depending on what assumptions are chosen, the operator basis has now been extended through \u2206 i = 12 in the SM using more sophisticated mathematical techniques (Henning et al., 2015). However, the important and simple to understand point is that as \u2206 i increases the number of operators greatly proliferates. Therefore even though in this review we are only interested in operators which can modify multiple vector boson production, there will be a much larger number of operators than can contribute at larger \u2206 i . One final point to keep in mind, when using an EFT of a particular set of fields (in this case the SM fields): there is inherently a basis choice that one must make, as operators can be related to one another through various identities, integration by parts, or equations of motion. In this review we focus on operators that affect multi-gauge boson production, but one must keep the basis choice in mind when comparing to bounds on other operators involving the gauge boson and Higgs fields not surveyed here.",

Nevertheless, anomalous coupling searches existed long before the modern EFT point of view and therefore they have remained as a legacy that still remains in the experimental community. The original parametrization of anomalous triple gauge boson couplings and quartic gauge boson couplings, is given in Equation (1). As mentioned earlier, in an attempt to make Equation (1) more relevant in the LEP era the general parametrization was reformulated in a \"gauge-invariant\" manner where g Z 1 = g \u03b3 1 = \u03ba Z = \u03ba \u03b3 = 1 (appropriately rescaled by the coupling constants g of SU (2) and g of U (1) Y ) while all other terms do not exist at tree-level in the SM.

Both experiments provide inclusive diboson cross sections, and ATLAS additionally provides exclusive cross sections where central jet activity has been vetoed. As illustrated in Figure 7, CMS finds the cross section to be compatible with the MCFM prediction at NLO in QCD as a function of the photon E T out to 100 GeV, while ATLAS measures inclusive cross sections higher than the NLO prediction in the inclusive process for high-E T photons. NNLO corrections are found to increase the NLO prediction by \u2248 20%, hence improving the agreement with the measured cross sections (Grazzini et al., 2015a).",

The production of W W pairs in the fully leptonic decay mode with an oppositely charged lepton (electron or muon) pair and missing transverse energy in the final state has been studied by ATLAS (Aad et al., 2011a, 2012d, 2013d) and CMS (Chatrchyan et al., 2011b(Chatrchyan et al., , 2013d) at 7 TeV using data samples with integrated luminosities of up to 5 fb \u22121 . Figure 12 shows the spectra of the highest p T lepton of the final state pair as observed by ATLAS and CMS. Also shown are the modifications to the spectrum caused by aTGCs for which no evidence was found. Both experiments do not include resonant production via the Higgs boson in their signal model and observe W W production cross sections larger than (then state-of-the-art) NLO predictions, consistent with the significant cross section enhancements predicted by NNLO calculations (Gehrmann et al., 2014). Additional measurements such as the ratio of the inclusive W W cross section to the Z boson cross section (Chatrchyan et al., 2013d) and normalized fiducial cross section as function of the leading lepton p T (Aad et al., 2013d) are provided as well and are found to be in agreement with theory predictions. W W production in the fully leptonic decay mode has been studied by ATLAS (Aad et al., 2016e) and CMS (Chatrchyan et al., 2013f;Khachatryan et al., 2016f) as well in 8 TeV data samples with integrated luminosities of up to 20 fb \u22121 . While ATLAS includes Higgs-mediated W W production as signal, CMS subtracts the small corresponding expected contribution. The measured fiducial and total production cross sections are found to be consistent with NNLO predictions (Grazzini et al., 2016a), and (normalized) differential cross sections are measured as a function of kinematic event variables. CMS includes a measurement of the total W W production cross section in events with exactly one jet, while ATLAS vetoes events with reconstructed jets. No evidence for anomalous W W \u03b3 and W W Z TGCs is observed and hence limits on the corresponding parameters are set. An alternative EFT formulation of aTGC with dimension six operators is introduced (Degrande et al., 2013c) with corresponding coefficients c W , c W W W and c B that can be mapped to the LEP formulation which allows comparisons with earlier data. Figure 13 shows the dilepton mass spectrum as measured by CMS (Khachatryan et al., 2016f) together with the distorted spectral shape that would result from aTGC contributions. Figure 14 gives an overview of the total W W production cross sections measured at hadron colliders at different center of mass energies in comparison with the expectations of theory.",

In the elastic case, both protons remain intact after the interaction, while in the case of single (double) dissociation one (both) of the protons dissociate. In either case, the proton (remnants) closely follow the original beam direction and hence escape detection, leaving only the W boson decay products in the detector without the additional activity present in inclusive processes. The production of W + W \u2212 from photon scattering gives access to the SM QGC from the W W \u03b3\u03b3 vertex. The W W \u03b3\u03b3 coupling is the sole SM QGC contribution to the process since no \"tag\" jets indicating beam breakup are allowed which suppresses the W W W W , W W ZZ and W W Z\u03b3 processes.",

Limits on aTGC have been presented by experiments at LEP, the Tevatron and the LHC. aTGC limits arise when specific spectra of final state particles are compared to the expectations of the SM with additional aTGC terms in the Lagrangian. The specific spectra used at the LHC were shown in Sections IV, VI for aTGCs and Sections V, VII for aQGCs. It should be noted that higher order (NNLO QCD and NLO EW) corrections will significantly impact the SM expectation in the tails of the utilized distributions, and the incorporation of such corrections depends on the timing of the corrections becoming available versus when the analysis was carried out. The various limits made with different diboson and VBF final states are here collected and compared. Typically, one-dimensional (1-d) limits are quoted where only one operator is allowed to be non-zero at a time. In a few cases two operators are allowed to float simultaneously, a procedure which illustrates the correlations between the effects of the operators.",

Where the exclusive process \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 W W is used to set a limit it is the most stringent, because the signal is so clean that it dominates the final selected data. The sensitivity of ATLAS and CMS to anomalous couplings is generally very similar. Limits on f M,2 and f M,3 were not included in the summary when they are trivially related to f M,0 and f M,1 by a factor of two under the assumption of a vanishing anomalous W W Z\u03b3 coupling (Khachatryan et al., 2016a). The ATLAS W \u03b3\u03b3 and Z\u03b3\u03b3 results are again converted to the convention employed by CMS, using the relations given in (Degrande et al., 2013b). The W V \u03b3 and \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 W W results are based on the dimension-six operators with coefficients a W 0,C which are then converted to dimension-eight operators with coefficients f M,0 and f M,1 . The conversion conventions employed by ATLAS (Degrande et al., 2013b) and CMS (Belanger et al., 2000) differ because CMS implemented their own Lagrangians in MadGraph5 aMCNLO for W V \u03b3 and \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 W W .",

With the enhanced data set, diboson differential cross section measurements in the high\u015d tails of distributions will be possible as well as detailed studies of VBF, VBS and triboson production, from establishing the signals to measuring differential cross sections with high precision. The discovery reach for new higher-dimensional operators studied in W \u00b1 W \u00b1 , W Z, ZZ VBS processes and Z\u03b3\u03b3 is at least doubled in the HL-LHC data set (Aad et al., 2013h). The proceedings of the Snowmass community study (Bardeen et al., 2013) also quantify the dimension-eight operator sensitivity increase due to the HL-LHC to be a factor of two to three over the LHC, based on independent studies (Baak et al., 2013;Degrande et al., 2013a)  Measuring the polarization fractions in VBS is a crucial experimental test of the predicted unitarization of the longitudinal VBS cross section by the SM Higgs boson. CMS (Khachatryan et al., 2015i) has evaluated the expected sensitivity to measure the longitudinal fraction in W \u00b1 W \u00b1 scattering using a two-dimensional template fit of the \u2206\u03a6 between the two tagging jets and the p T of the leading lepton and expect a significance of \u2248 2.4\u03c3 in the HL-LHC data set as illustrated in Figure 48 (a). Combining this with a corresponding W Z VBS analysis, the longitudinal VBS significance increases to 2.75\u03c3. It should be noted that a significant increase in sensitivity should still be possible using a deep machine learning technique instead of a \"simple\" variable fit, as demonstrated for the W \u00b1 W \u00b1 VBS case in (Searcy et al., 2016).",

Does this mean that all channels and interpretations suffer this difficulty when using EFTs to parametrize new physics at the LHC? No. It simply reflects that for aTGCs, given that the Wilson operators then the effective theory is useless as it cannot be made systematic.\"), this point has not been sufficiently stressed in the recent years where EFTs have become more and more used in the experimental communities. This does not mean that the LHC doesn't have enormous capabilities for searching for new physics and constraining a wide variety of models that LEP could never dream of constraining.

However, multi-boson processes still are one of, if not, the most important channels to search for new physics due to their connection to EWSB. In principle, new physics accessible at LHC energies could be discovered or constrained by direct searches in groups other than the SM groups.

The leptonic mode has less background but the branching fraction of the W pair is about six times smaller than in the semi-leptonic case when considering the decay modes involving electrons and muons. In addition, the W W pair mass in a semi-leptonic decay can be fully reconstructed up to a quadratic ambiguity, so that the energy at the TGC vertex is directly measurable in contrast to the leptonic decay case. However, in the semileptonic decay mode hadronic W boson decays cannot be fully distinguished from hadronic Z boson decays due to limited dijet mass resolution. The semileptonic W W decay is hence studied together with the semileptonic W Z decay in Section IV.E.
