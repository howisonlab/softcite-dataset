The measurements of the coherence factor and strong-phase difference are made using quantum-correlated, fullyreconstructed D 0 D 0 pairs produced in e + e \u2212 collisions at the \u03c8(3770) resonance. The measured values are R K 0 S K\u03c0 = 0.73 \u00b1 0.08 and \u03b4 \u2022 for a region where the combined K 0 S \u03c0 \u00b1 invariant mass is within 100 MeV/c 2 of the K * (892) \u00b1 mass. These results indicate a significant level of coherence in the decay. In addition, isobar models are presented for the two decays, which show the dominance of the K * (892) \u00b1 resonance. The branching ratio B(D 0 \u2192 K 0 S K + \u03c0 \u2212 )/B(D 0 \u2192 K 0 S K \u2212 \u03c0 + ) is determined to be 0.592 \u00b1 0.044 (stat.) \u00b1 0.018 (syst.), which is more precise than previous measurements.

These twin decays are of interest for a variety of reasons. Firstly when produced through a B \u2212 \u2192 DK \u2212 decay, where D is either a D 0 or D 0 , they can be exploited to measure the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) phase \u03b3 [1].

            "text": "This paper describes several measurements performed with data collected by the CLEO experiment that are valuable for each of these purposes. These are a first determination of the coherence factor and average strongphase difference for the two decays, a determination of the relative branching ratio of the decays that is more precise than previous measurements [4], and the presentation of isobar models to describe each decay. The coherence factor R K 0 S K\u03c0 and the average strong-phase difference \u03b4 K 0 S K\u03c0 D [5] for D 0 \u2192 K 0 S K \u2213 \u03c0 \u00b1 are measured using quantum-correlated, fully-reconstructed D 0 D 0 pairs produced in e + e \u2212 collisions at the \u03c8(3770) resonance. Knowledge of these parameters improves the sensitivity of measurements of the unitary triangle angle \u03b3 using B \u2212 meson decays to DK \u2212 where the D decays to K 0 S K \u2212 \u03c0 + or K 0 S K + \u03c0 \u2212 . To probe for the effects of physics beyond the standard model, it will be necessary to over-constrain the CKM quark-mixing matrix. An accurate measurement of \u03b3 in B \u2192 DK decays is of particular importance as the extracted phase is robust against new physics contributions, thus providing a standard model reference against which other measurements can be compared. The sensitivity to \u03b3 comes from the interference of b \u2192 u and b \u2192 c quark transitions. The weak phase between these two transitions is \u2212\u03b3. The amplitudes are related by A(B \u2212 \u2192D 0 K \u2212 )/A(B \u2212 \u2192 D 0 K \u2212 ) = r B e i(\u03b4 b \u2212\u03b3) , where r B has a value around 0.1 and is the absolute amplitude ratio, and \u03b4 B is the strong-phase difference. Sensitivity to \u03b3 is obtained by comparing the four separate decay rates involving B \u2212 and B + , and the two possi-bleD final states. This method is directly analogous to the ADS method [6], originally proposed to exploit Cabibbo-favored (CF) and doubly-Cabibbo-suppressed (DCS) decays such as K\u03c0, K\u03c0\u03c0\u03c0, and K\u03c0\u03c0 0 , rather than the SCS modes under consideration here. In the case of decays to multi-body flavor specific final states it is necessary to take into account that the amplitude ratio of D 0 \u2192 K 0 S K \u2212 \u03c0 + and D 0 \u2192 K 0 S K + \u03c0 \u2212 and the strong-phase difference will vary over phase space. Rate equations for different final states are given by [5] ",

The larger value of r D means that the per-event sensitivity to \u03b3 from the D 0 \u2192 K 0 S K \u2212 \u03c0 + decays [Eq.

Therefore knowledge of the coherence factor in D 0 \u2192 K 0 S K \u2213 \u03c0 \u00b1 decays is valuable, as it enables these channels to be added to the set of modes with which \u03b3 can be measured using B \u2212 \u2192 DK \u2212 decays.

A total of 15.3 fb \u22121 of data was collected by the CLEO III detector. For these data the Cornell electron storage ring (CESR) accelerator operated at a range of energies from \u221a s = 7.0 GeV to \u221a s = 11.2 GeV. For the data collected by the CLEO-c detector analyzed in this paper, the CESR energy was \u221a s = 3770 MeV and an integrated luminosity of 0.818 fb \u22121 of data was accumulated. The CLEO III/CLEO-c detector was a solenoidal detector which included a gaseous tracking system for the measurement of charged particle momenta and ionization energy loss, a ring-imaging Cherenkov (RICH) detector to aid in particle identification, and a CsI crystal calorimeter to measure the energy of electromagnetic showers. The tracking system was particularly important in defining the candidate signal sample for the measurements in this paper. The CLEO III tracking system [8] consisted of a silicon strip vertex detector and a large drift chamber. The silicon was replaced by a six-layer wire vertex detector in the CLEO-c configuration [9]. The trackers achieved charged particle momentum resolution of 0.35% (0.6%) at 1 GeV/c in the 1.5 T (1.0 T) axial magnetic field used in CLEO III (CLEO-c) detector, respectively. The detectors are described in detail elsewhere [10].",

The isobar models are determined from flavor-tagged data from the CLEO III and CLEO-c detectors. The data collected by CLEO III are flavor-tagged using the decay D * + \u2192 D 0 \u03c0 + , in which the flavor of the decaying neutral D meson is inferred from the charge of the pion. In the case of the data collected by the CLEO-c detector the interaction of interest is e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c8(3770) \u2192 D 0D0 where one D meson, the signal side, decays to K 0 S K \u2213 \u03c0 \u00b1 and the other, the tag side, decays to either K \u2213 \u03c0 \u00b1 , K \u2213 \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , or K \u2213 \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03c0 0 .

The kaon and pion from the D meson and the tagging pion from the D * are required to pass close to the interaction point: within 5 cm along the beam axis, and 5 mm perpendicular to it. The cosine of the angle between the track and the beam pipe is required to lie between \u22120.9 and 0.9, to ensure that the track lies within the detector acceptance. The momentum of the slow pion track is required to be between 0.15 and 0.50 GeV/c. All other tracks have a minimum momentum requirement of 0.2 GeV/c and a maximum momentum of 5.0 GeV/c. Charged pions are used to reconstruct the K 0 S candidates and the flight significance of the K 0 S candidate is required to be greater than 8, where the flight significance is given by the measured flight distance divided by the measured flight distance uncertainty. Kaons and pions are distinguished by using information from the RICH detector if the momentum of the kaon track is above 500 MeV/c, otherwise ionization energy loss from the drift chamber is used. Kaon and pion candidates are combined with a K 0 S candidate to form a D 0 candidate. The slow pion candidate is combined with the D 0 candidate to form a D * candidate. In order to suppress combinatoric backgrounds and backgrounds from B meson decays, the momentum of the D * is required to be greater than half its maximum possible value (for a given beam energy). Loose selection requirements are placed on the D 0 and D * fitted vertex \u03c7 2 to remove combinatoric candidates.",

The largest contribution of peaking background arises from D 0 \u2192 K 0 S X decays, where the K 0 S is not reconstructed and the decay is mistaken for D 0 \u2192 K 0 L X. As an example, Fig. 3 shows the missing mass squared spectrum for the K 0 L \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 tag in data and the background Monte Carlo distribution scaled to the integrated luminosity of the data. In the signal region the peaking contribution of the K 0 S \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decays can be seen in the background Monte Carlo.

Although the DCS rate is much smaller than the CF rate, the interference between the two amplitudes is a significant effect in the quantum-correlated CLEO-c data. To determine the size of this effect the data are fit with a modified PDF for the CLEO-c data. In the case of the favored data, the alternate PDF uses a total amplitude given by A tot = A fav + 0.05 \u00d7 0.7 \u00d7 A sup e i\u03b4 . The parameters of the suppressed model are fixed to their default values, while the parameters of the favored model are free. The factor 0.05 arises from the approximate ratio of DCS to CF amplitudes in neutral D meson decays to K\u03c0. There is, however, dilution as the K\u03c0\u03c0\u03c0 and K\u03c0\u03c0 0 tags are not fully coherent. The factor of 0.7 accounts for the weighted average of the fully coherent K\u03c0 decay and the coherence factors for the other two tags measured in [7]. Additionally there is an unknown absolute phase \u03b4 between the favored and suppressed amplitude models. To account for this, the fit is repeated assuming a phase difference of zero, \u03c0/2, \u03c0, and 3\u03c0/2. The largest shifts in the fitted parameters are observed for a phase difference of zero and these are taken to be the systematic uncertainty. In general the systematic uncertainty due to this effect is about 25% of the statistical error. In the CLEO III data there is no quantum-correlation, however mistags occur when a track of the wrong charge is misidentified as the pion from the D * .

In addition, alternate background models are determined using a fit to the background samples with fewer pseudo-resonances. The alternate parametrizations are used in the fit to signal data, and the observed shifts are used as the systematic uncertainty. The uncertainty on the efficiency shape over the Dalitz plot is assessed using alternate parametrizations for the efficiency shape. In the case of CLEO III a thirdorder polynomial is used instead of the default secondorder polynomial. In the case of CLEO-c the efficiency is parametrized by a fourth-order polynomial instead of using the Monte-Carlo-simulated sample directly. The uncertainties on efficiency, purity, and background shapes each contribute an uncertainty of approximately 10% of the statistical uncertainty. The default fit does not take into account the detector resolution on the Dalitz plot, and hence all data points are slightly shifted from their true positions. To account for the resulting uncertainty, the K 0 S , K, and \u03c0 momenta are smeared in data, according to parameters determined from Monte Carlo simulation, and the fit is performed on the smeared sample. This systematic uncertainty is negligible in comparison to other contributions. The validity of the fitter is assessed via fits to many samples of simulated data generated from the PDFs. A small uncertainty of order 10% of the statistical uncertainty is assigned due to small residual biases between the generated and fitted parameters. A summary of the systematic uncertainties for each effect as a fraction of the statistical uncertainty on the amplitudes, phases, and fit fractions for models 1 are given in Table VIII and IX.

This large, common resonant structure gives the expectation of significant coherence between the two decay modes, particularly in the region of the K * (892) \u00b1 resonance. The data for the suppressed decay show a broad extended shape either side of the K * (892) \u00b1 resonance in the m 2 K 0 S \u03c0 projection which is not present in the favored decay. This difference is apparent in the models as the favored models have a very small contribution from the K * (1430) 0 resonance which is described by a broad S-wave lineshape, while in the suppressed models this is a significant contribution to the overall model. In the favored models the fit fraction of the K * (1410) 0 resonance is large, which is unexpected as the K \u2213 \u03c0 \u00b1 channel proceeds by a suppressed W boson exchange. However the large fit fraction can be understood by considering the destructive interference between K * (1410) 0 and K * (1680) \u00b1 which is also significant.

The two mesons are produced in a C-odd eigenstate and therefore the decays of the two D mesons are quantum-correlated. There are three categories of double tags used. The first of these are the flavor tags, where the samples of double tags are split into two classes: those where the tag kaon and the kaon from the signal side have the same sign of charge (SS) and those where the two kaons have opposite sign of charge (OS). The second category of double tags are those where the tag D meson decays to a CP eigenstate, which can either be even or odd.

In the restricted kinematic region case, a further systematic uncertainty arises due to detector resolution as the candidate events may migrate across the defined boundary in the Dalitz plot. To account for this migration simulated signal data samples are generated using the resonant models determined in the amplitude analysis. For the CP tags and the K 0 S,L \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 tags the quantum correlation between the tag and signal side is emulated. Candidate events can migrate into the restricted region, or they can migrate out. There is no systematic uncer-   tainty if the migration in both directions is equal, but the presence of the resonance means that a larger fraction of events will migrate out of the restricted region than migrate in. The net migration factor is determined from the simulated data. It is different for different types of tags due to the quantum correlations which alter the distribution of the K 0 S K\u03c0 decay on the Dalitz plot. The net migration factor is treated in the same way as a systematic uncertainty on the efficiency in the analysis. The net migration factor, that is the net loss of events inside the region, varies between tag categories and is of order 1% of the yield within the region.",
