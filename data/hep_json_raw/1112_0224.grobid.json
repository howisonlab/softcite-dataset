The analysis is based on combined H1 and ZEUS inclusive DIS cross section measurements together with inclusive jet cross section measurements provided by both H1 and ZEUS collaborations. The inclusion of the jet data significantly reduces the correlation between the gluon PDF and the strong coupling, improving the precision of the gluon PDF and providing an accurate determination of \u03b1 S (M Z ) using DIS data from HERA only.",

Only at next-to-leading order (NLO) and beyond do they become sensitive to the gluon density (scaling violations) and the strong coupling, which are however strongly correlated. Inclusive jets in DIS, when measured for example in the Breit frame, are sensitive to the gluon density and the strong coupling already in LO, via the boson-gluon fusion process. This process dominates for the negative photon momentum transfer squared, or photon virtuality, Q 2 , less than about 1000 GeV 2 . Above that value the QCD-Compton process becomes dominant, providing sensitivity to the strong coupling without being correlated to the gluon. Therefore, one can expect that the addition of jet measurements to the hitherto mainly used inclusive measurements alone will allow a reduction of the correlation between the gluon density and the strong coupling, thereby making it possible to extract simultaneously both PDFs and the strong coupling from DIS data.",

Thus, precise combined data sets with total uncertainties between 1 \u2212 2% (for NC) over most of the phase space are used. The systematic correlated and uncorrelated errors are well controlled, such that the standard \u2206\u03c7 2 = 1 uncertainty criterion can be used.

The parametrization uncertainty is estimated by adding one additional parameter at a time, changing the parametrizations and varying the starting scale Q 2 0 around the default value of 1.9 GeV 2 . A model uncertainty is determined by varying the heavy quark masses, f s and Q 2 min around their default values. Q 2 min specifies the minimal Q 2 for a data point to be included in the fit. The fit of the PDFs is performed using the NLO DGLAP equations, employing the QCDNUM [5] evolution code.

            "text": "A NLO QCD fit with simultaneous determinations of the proton PDFs and \u03b1 S (M Z ) was performed using HERA DIS data only. Combined H1 and ZEUS inclusive NC and CC cross sections together with inclusive jet cross sections from the H1 and ZEUS collaborations have been used. Including jet data in the fit and treating \u03b1 S (M Z ) as a free parameter, dramatically reduces the correlations between the gluon density and the strong coupling compared to the fit without jets. The precision of the gluon density is improved, and an accurate and unbiased determination of \u03b1 S (M Z ) is achieved, yielding a value consistent with the world average.",
