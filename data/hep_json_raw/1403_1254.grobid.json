These include pentaquark baryons, the six-quark H-dibaryon, and tetra-quark, hybrid, and glueball mesons. Despite extensive experimental searches, no unambiguous candidates for any of these exotic configurations have yet to be identified. On the other hand, a number of meson states, one that seems to be a proton-antiproton bound state, and others that contain either charmed-anticharmed quark pairs or bottom-antibottom quark pairs, have been recently discovered that neither fit into the quark-antiquark meson picture nor match the expected properties of the QCD-inspired exotics. Here I briefly review results from a recent search for the H-dibaryon, and discuss some properties of the newly discovered states -the so-called XY Z mesons-and compare them with expectations for conventional quark-antiquark mesons and the predicted QCD-exotic states.",

In the SM, quarks and gluons are related to mesons and baryons by the long-distance regime of QCD, which remains the least understood aspect of the theory. Since firstprinciple lattice-QCD (LQCD) calculations are still not practical for most long-distance phenomena, a number of models motivated by the color structure of QCD have been proposed. However, so far at least, predictions of these QCD-motivated models that pertain to the spectrum of hadrons have not had great success.",

Using similar considerations based on QCD, two quark triplets can be combined to form a \"diquark\" antitriplet and a sextet as illustrated in Fig. 1a. In QCD, these diquarks will have color: combining a red triplet with a blue triplet -as shown in the figure -produces a magenta (anti-green) diquark and for the antitriplet combination, which is antisymmetric in color space, the color force between the two quarks is expected to be attractive. Likewise, green-red and blue-green diquarks form yellow (antiblue) and cyan (antired) antitriplets as shown in Fig. 1b.",

These so-called \"exotic\" states include pentaquark baryons, H-dibaryons and tetraquark mesons, and are illustrated in Fig. 1c. Other proposed exotic states are glueballs, which are mesons made only from gluons, hybrids formed from a q,q and a gluon, and deuteron-like bound states of color-singlet \"normal\" hadrons, commonly referred to as molecules. These are illustrated in Fig. 1d. Glueball and hybrid mesons are motivated by QCD; molecules are a generalization of classical nuclear physics to systems of subatomic partics.",

Decays of narrow \u03a5(nS) (n = 1, 2, 3) bottomonium (bb) resonances are particularly well suited for searches for multiquark states with non-zero strangeness. The \u03a5(nS) states are flavor-SU (3) singlets that primarily decay via annihilation into three gluons. The gluons materialize into u\u016b, dd and ss pairs with nearly equal probabilities, creating final states with a high density of quarks and antiquarks in a limited volume of phase space. A benchmark for the rate for multiquark-state production in these decays is the measured inclusive decay branching fractions to antideuteronsD: B(\u03a5(1S) \u2192D + X) = (2.9 \u00b1 0.3) \u00d7 10 \u22125 and B(\u03a5(2S) \u2192D + X) = (3.4 \u00b1 0.6) \u00d7 10 \u22125 [10]. If the six-quark H-dibaryon is produced at a rate that is similar to that for six-quark antideuterons, there should be many thousands of them in the 102 million \u03a5(1S) and 158 million \u03a5(2S) event samples collected by Belle.",

The lower panel in the figure shows how the M (pp) spectrum looks when the effects of phase-space are divided out (assuming an S-wave pp system). It seems apparent from the phase-space-corrected plot that the dynamical source for this enhancement, whatever it may be, is at or below the mass threshold. A fit with a Breit-Wigner (BW) line shape modified by a kinematic threshold factor yielded a peak mass of 1859 +6 \u221227 MeV and width \u0393 < 30 MeV [14]. It was subsequently pointed out that the BW form used by BESII should be modified to include the effect of final-state-interactions on the shape of the pp mass spectrum [17]. When this is done, the peak mass shifts downward, from 1859 MeV to 1831 \u00b1 7 MeV and the range of allowed widths increases to \u0393 < 153 MeV Soon after the BESII publication, Yan and Ding proposed a Skyrme-like model for proton-antiproton interactions in which BESII's pp mass-threshold enhancement is an S-wave pp bound state with binding energy around 20 MeV [18].",

Since a preferred channel for low-energy S-wave pp annihlation is \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b7 , Yan and Ding advocated a search for subthreshold decays of this same state in radiative J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b7 decays. A subsequent BESII study of J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b7 decays found a distinct peak at 1834 \u00b1 7 MeV and width 68 \u00b1 21 MeV as shown in the center-right panel of Fig. 3  [19], in good agreement with the mass and width results from the FSI-corrected fit to the pp mass spectrum.",

The pp mass-threshold enhancement was confirmed at the same mass with much higher statistics by BESIII [20], now with a significance that is > 30\u03c3 (see the right panel of Fig. 3). The large BESIII event sample permitted the application of a partial wave analysis (PWA) that established the J P C = 0 \u2212+ quantum number assignment, in agreement with baryonium expectations. The M (\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b7 ) peak in J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b7 decays was also confirmed and the production angle distribution was found to be consistent with a J P C = 0 \u2212+ assignment. But the new result finds a much larger width than that found for the pp peak in the BESIII partial wave analysis: \u0393 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b7 = 190 \u00b1 38 MeV versus the \u0393 pp < 76 MeV upper limit from the BESIII PWA. Another puzzling feature is the lack of any evidence for the pp threshold enhancement in any other channels, such as J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c9pp [22], \u03a5(1S) \u2192 \u03b3pp [23] or in B decays [24].

Since the c and b quarks are heavy, their production from the vacuum in the fragmentation process is heavily suppressed. Thus, heavy quarks that are seen among the decay products of a hadron must have existed among its original constituents. In addition, the heavy quarks in conventional QQ \"quarkonium\" mesons are slow and can be described reasonably well by non-relativistic Quantum Mechanics. Indeed it was the success of the charmonium model description of the \u03c8 and \u03c7 c states in the mid-1970's that led to the general acceptance of the reality of quarks and the validity of the quark model. The Quarkonium model specifies the allowed states of a QQ system; if a meson decays to a final state with a Q and aQ and does not match the expected properties of any of the unfilled levels in the associated quarkonium spectrum, it is necessarily exotic.",

In addition all of the J P C = 1 \u2212\u2212 states above 2m D have also been identified. The gray boxes show the remaining unfilled, but predicted charmonium states. The red boxes show electrically neutral X and Y mesons and the purple boxes show the charged Z mesons, aligned according to my best guess at the J P C quantum numbers of their neutral charged partner. (Not included here are recently discovered resonances in the J/\u03c8\u03c6 channel, which are discussed in a recent review by Yi [27].) In the following, I briefly comment on each of the XY Z entries. ; their production mechanism and their decay modes provide strong circumstantial evidence for J P C = 0 \u2212+ assignments. In both cases, the measured masses are far below expectations for the only available 0 \u2212+ charmonium levels, the \u03b7 c (3S) and \u03b7 c (4S). These assignments would imply hyperfine n 3 S \u2212 n 1 S mass splittings that increase from the measured value of 47.2 \u00b1 1.2 MeV for n = 2 [10], to \u223c 100 MeV for n = 3 and \u223c 350 MeV for n = 4.

BaBar measured its J P C quantum numbers to be 0 ++ [42]. The PDG currently assigns this as the \u03c7 c0 (2P ) charmonium level, an assignment that has two problems: i) since the \u03c7 c2 (2P ) has been established with mass 3927 \u00b1 3 MeV, the Y (3915) = \u03c7 c0 (2P ) assignment would imply that the 2 3 P 2 \u2212 2 3 P 0 fine splitting is only 9 \u00b1 4 MeV, and tiny in comparison with the corresponding n = 1 splitting of 141.4 \u00b1 0.3 MeV [10]; ii) there is no sign of Y (3915) \u2192 DD decay. Belle [43] and BaBar [44] have studied the process B \u2192 KDD, and both groups see a prominent signal for \u03c8(3770) \u2192 DD but no hint of a DD mass peak near 3915 MeV (see the two right-most panels in Fig. 5). Since neither group reported any Y (3915)-related limit, I derived my own conservative upper limit by scaling the total number of Belle events in the two mass bins surrounding 3915 MeV in the center-right panel of Fig. 5 to the \u03c8(3770) signal, while assuming constant acceptance. This gives B(Y (3915) \u2192 DD) < B(Y (3915) \u2192 \u03c9J/\u03c8), which strongly contradicts theoretical expectations that for the \u03c7 c0 (2P ), the DD decay channel should dominate [45]. (Note: some of the literatureand the PDG -refer to this state as the X(3915).)",

The large Y (4260) \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8 signal seen in the charmonium mass region motivated a Belle search for similar behavior in the bottomonium system [50] that uncovered an anomalously large \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03a5(nS) (n = 1, 2, 3) production rates that peak around \u221a s = 10.89 GeV as shown in the upper-left panel of Fig. 6 [51]. The peak position of the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03a5(nS) yield is about 2\u03c3 higher than that of the peak in the e + e \u2212 \u2192 hadron cross section at \u221a s 10.87 GeV that is usually associated with the conventional \u03a5(5S) bb meson (and shown in the lower left panel of Fig. 6). If the peak in the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03a5(nS) cross section is attributed to the \u03a5(5S), it implies \u03a5(5S) \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03a5(nS), (n = 1, 2, 3) partial widths that are hundreds of times larger than both theoretical predictions [52] and the corresponding measured values for the \u03a5(4S) [10]).

There, dramatic near-threshold peaks are seen in both the D 0 D * \u2212 and D +D * 0 invariant mass distributions; as an example, the M (D 0 D * \u2212 ) distribution is shown in the center-left panel of Fig. 8. The weighted average mass and width from fits of a threshold-modified BW line shapes to these distributions gives resonance pole position (M pole + i\u0393 pole ) values of M pole = 3883.9 \u00b1 4.5 MeV and \u0393 pole = 24.8 \u00b1 12 MeV. For these data, the production angle dependence strongly favors a J P = 1 + quantum number assignment and decisively rules out J P = 0 \u2212 and 1 \u2212 (0 + is ruled out by parity conservation). Since the pole mass position is 2\u03c3 lower than the Z c (3900) mass, BESIII tentatively named this DD * state the Z c (3885). In the mass determinations of both the Z c (3885) and Z c (3900), effects of possible interference with a coherent component of the background are ignored. Since this can bias the measurements by amounts comparable to the resonance widths, which are large, this may account for the discrepancy in masses. A partial wave analysis of the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8 channel, which is currently underway, may establish the J P quantum numbers of the Z c (3900) and provide important input into the question of whether or not these are the same state. If the Z c (3885) and the Z c (3900) are in fact the same, the partial width for DD * decays is 6.2 \u00b1 2.9 times larger than that for J/\u03c8\u03c0. This is small compared to open-charm versus hidden-charm decay-width ratios for established charmonium states that are above the open-charm threshold, such as the \u03c8(3770) and \u03c8(4040), where corresponding ratios are measured to be more than an order-of-magnitude larger [10].",

The best fit includes a a BW term with peak mass near 4025 MeV, dubbed the Z c (4025) [59]. Here a fit using a mass-independent-width BW line shape function modified by a phase space factor that accounts for the nearby 2m D * mass threshold yields a mass M Zc(4025) = 4026.3 \u00b1 4.5 MeV, which is \u223c 10 MeV above the 2m D * threshold, and a width \u0393 Zc(4025) = 24.5 \u00b1 9.5 MeV.

There are at least four states very close the DD * threshold. The X(3872) is right at the D 0 + D * 0 threshold and seems to be an isospin singlet [61]. The Z c (3885) pole mass is about 10 MeV above the D 0 D * \u2212 or D +D * 0 threshold and is an isospin triplet. Both have J P = 1 + and couple to S-wave DD * final states. The Z c (4020)/Z c (4025) states show the existence of at least one isospin triplet just above the D * D * threshold. If this is the charmed-sector equivalent of the Z b (10650), then it has J P = 1 + , in which case there is, at present, no obvious candidate for a isospin-singlet counterpart. If such a state exists with a mass that is above the 2m D * threshold and with a relatively narrow width, it might be accessible in B \u2212 \u2192 K \u2212 D * D * decays.

However, if, as expected, the b-quark-sector equivalent of the X(3872) has J P C = 1 ++ , zero isospin, and is near the BB * mass threshold, the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03a5(1S) decay mode, for which the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 would originate from \u03c1 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , would violate isospin and be strongly suppressed relative to decays to the isospin-conserving \u03c9\u03a5(1S) final state. (This is not the case for the X(3872) where the isospin-allowed \u03c9J/\u03c8 decay mode is kinematically suppressed: i.e., Q c m D 0 + m D * 0 \u2212 m J/\u03c8 = 776 MeV, which is twice the \u03c9 natural width below its peak mass m \u03c9 = 783 MeV.

Thus, \u03c9\u03a5(1S) final states are probably more relevant that \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03a5(1S) for searches for isospin-singlet counterparts of the Z b (10610) and Z b (10650).

            "text": "The QCD exotic states that are much preferred by theorists, such as pentaquarks, the H-dibaryon, and meson hybrids with exotic J P C values continue to elude confirmation even in experiments with increasingly high levels of sensitivity. On the other hand, a candidate pp bound state and a rich spectroscopy of quarkoniumlike states that do not fit into the remaining unassigned levels for cc charmonium and bb bottomonium states has emerged. No compelling theoretical picture has yet been found that provides a compelling description of what is seen, but, since at least some of these states are near D ( * )D * or B ( * )B * thresholds and couple to S-wave combinations of these states, molecule-like configurations have to be important components of their wavefunctions [65]. This has inspired a new field of \"flavor chemistry\" that is attracting considerable attention both by the experimental and theoretical hadron physics communities [66].",
