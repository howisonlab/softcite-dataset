            "text": "This paper describes a search for pairs of neutral, long-lived particles decaying in the ATLAS calorimeter. Long-lived particles occur in many extensions to the Standard Model and may elude searches for new promptly decaying particles. The analysis considers neutral, long-lived scalars with masses between 5 and 400 GeV, produced from decays of heavy bosons with masses between 125 and 1000 GeV, where the long-lived scalars decay into Standard Model fermions. The analysis uses either 10.8 fb \u22121 or 33.0 fb \u22121 of data (depending on the trigger) recorded in 2016 at the LHC with the ATLAS detector in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. No significant excess is observed, and limits are reported on the production cross section times branching ratio as a function of the proper decay length of the long-lived particles.",

            "text": "Long-lived particles (LLPs) feature in a variety of models that have been proposed to address some of the open questions of the Standard Model (SM). Examples are: various supersymmetric (SUSY) models [1][2][3][4][5][6][7]; Neutral Naturalness [8][9][10][11] and Hidden Sector (HS) [12][13][14] models that address the hierachy problem; models that seek to incorporate dark matter [15][16][17][18], or explain the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the universe [19]; and models that lead to massive neutrinos [20,21]. Decays of LLPs created in collider experiments would produce unique signatures that may have been overlooked by previous searches for particles that decay promptly. This paper presents a search sensitive to neutral LLPs decaying mainly in the hadronic calorimeter (HCal) or at the outer edge of the electromagnetic calorimeter (ECal) of the ATLAS detector. This allows the analysis to probe LLP proper decay lengths (c\u03c4 , where c is the speed of light and \u03c4 is the lifetime of the LLP) ranging between a few centimetres and a few tens e-mail: atlas.publications@cern.ch of metres. In HS models, a proposed new set of particles and forces is weakly coupled to the SM via a mediator particle. As a benchmark, this analysis uses a simplified HS model [12][13][14]22,23], in which the SM and HS are connected via a heavy neutral boson ( ), which may decay into two long-lived neutral scalar bosons (s). The neutral scalars are assumed not to interact with the detector. While could be the Higgs boson, this analysis considers mediators with masses ranging from 125 to 1000 GeV, and scalars with masses between 5 and 400 GeV. The decay \u2192 ss \u2192 ff f f is considered, where f refers to fermions. Decays to bosons are not considered in the benchmark model used in this analysis. Since this model assumes that the branching ratios of the scalar decaying into SM fermions are the same as those of the SM Higgs, each long-lived scalar usually decays into heavy fermions: bb, cc, and \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 . The branching ratio among the different decays depends on the mass of the scalar but for m s \u2265 25 GeV it is almost constant and equal to 85:5:8. The SM quarks from the LLP decay hadronize, resulting in jets whose origins may be far from the interaction point (IP) of the collision. The proper decay lengths of LLPs in HS models are typically unconstrained, aside from a rough upper limit of c\u03c4 10 8 m given by the cosmological constraint of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis [24], and could be short enough for the LLPs to decay inside the ATLAS detector volume.",

            "text": "Previous searches for pair-produced neutral LLPs at hadron colliders have been performed at the Tevatron and at the LHC. At the Tevatron, searches by D\u2205 [25] and CDF [26] looked for displaced vertices in their tracking system only, allowing them to set limits on LLP proper decay lengths of the order of a few centimetres. At the LHC, the CMS experiment has performed searches at centre-of-mass energies of 7, 8 or 13 TeV for neutral LLPs by considering events with either converted photons and missing energy [27,28], or with lepton [29,30] or jet pairs [31,32] originating from displaced vertices in the tracking system. A CMS search for jet pairs originating in the tracker was also performed at 13 TeV [33]. The CMS searches are sensitive to LLP proper decay lengths from \u223c0.1 mm to \u223c2 m. Previous ATLAS searches for neutral LLPs consider events with photons [34], or particles originating from displaced vertices in the tracking system [35,36]. Other searches involve pairs of displaced jets in the HCal (8 TeV)  [37,38], or pairs of reconstructed vertices in the muon spectrometer (MS) at 7 and 13 TeV [39,40], or the combination of one displaced vertex in the MS and one in the inner tracking detector (8 TeV)  [41]. Other searches consider pairs of muons originating after the inner tracker [42,43]. These ATLAS searches are complementary, since they use different sub-detectors, and therefore their sensitivities are governed by different instrumental effects and sub-detector responses to the kinematics of the LLP decays. They also have different backgrounds, and different lifetime coverage due to the different physical location of the sub-detectors, with sensitivity to LLP proper decay lengths extending from a few millimeters to about 200 m.",

If the scalar decay occurs in the calorimeters, the two resulting quarks are reconstructed as a single jet with unusual features compared to jets from SM processes. These jets will typically have no associated activity in the tracking system. Furthermore, they will often have a high ratio of energy deposited in the HCal (E H ) to energy deposited in the ECal (E EM ). This ratio, E H /E EM , is referred to as the CalRatio. Finally, jets resulting from these decays will appear narrower than prompt jets when reconstructed with standard algorithms. This analysis requires two such non-standard jets.",

Jets are classified as signal-or background-like jets using machine learning in two steps: first, for every reconstructed jet, a multilayer perceptron, trained on signal jets from LLP decays, is used to predict the decay position of the particle that generated it; next, a per-jet Boosted Decision Tree (BDT) classifies jets as signal-like, multijet-like or BIB-like jets. Events are then classified as likely to have been produced by a signal process or a background process using a per-event BDT. Two separate versions of the per-event BDT are trained: one optimised for models with m \u2264 200 GeV (referred to as low-m models), and the other for models with m > 200 GeV (high-m models). The final sample is constructed by making a selection on the relevant per-event BDT output value of candidate events and imposing event quality criteria and requirements to suppress cosmic rays and BIB.

Two trigger paths are followed in this analysis, defined by two CalRatio triggers that differ only in the level-1 (L1) trigger selection. The high-E T trigger was originally designed for LHC Run 1. The trigger definition was adapted to the Run 2 higher energy and pile-up conditions by, among other modifications, raising the transverse energy (E T ) threshold as specified below. This higher threshold has a negative impact on the efficiency for models with m \u2264 200 GeV.

In September 2016 an upgraded L1 trigger component, the topological trigger, was commissioned in ATLAS. It introduces a new group of triggers that include geometric and kinematic selections on L1 objects. The low-E T trigger makes use of this L1 topological selection by accepting events where the largest energy deposit (and second-largest, if there is one) is required to have E T > 30 GeV deposited in the HCal, with the additional condition that there are no energy deposits in the ECal with E T > 3 GeV within a cone of size R = 0.2 around the HCal energy deposit. This veto on ECal deposits ensures a high value of E H /E EM at L1, rejecting a large portion of background events. The trigger rate obtained with this condition is low enough to allow the E T threshold to be kept as low as 30 GeV. This looser E T requirement increases the efficiency for the low-m signal models (those with m \u2264 200 GeV).",

The standard jet cleaning requirements [62] applied in most ATLAS analyses reject jets with high values of E H /E EM , one of the main characteristics of the displaced hadronic jets, and are therefore not included in these triggers. A dedicated cleaning algorithm for jets created in the HCal (referred to as CalRatio jet cleaning) is applied instead, with no requirements on the jet E H /E EM . At least one of the HLT jets passing the CalRatio jet cleaning is required to satisfy E T > 30 GeV, |\u03b7| < 2.5 and log 10 (E H /E EM ) > 1.2. Jets satisfying these requirements are used to determine 0.8 \u00d7 0.8 regions in \u03b7 \u00d7 \u03c6 centred on the jet axis in which to perform tracking. Triggering jets are required to have no tracks with p T > 2 GeV within R = 0.2 of the jet axis. Finally, jets satisfying all of the above criteria are required to pass a BIB removal algorithm that relies on cell timing and position. Muons from BIB enter the HCal horizontally and may radiate a photon via bremsstrahlung, generating an energy deposit that may be reconstructed as a signal-like jet. Deposits due to BIB are expected to have a very specific time distribution [63]. The algorithm identifies events as containing BIB if the triggering jet has at least four HCal-barrel cells at the same \u03c6 and in the same calorimeter layer with timing consistent with that of a BIB deposit. In both CalRatio triggers, events identified as BIB by the BIB algorithm are saved in the BIB dataset and events with no triggering jets identified as BIB are saved in the main dataset.",

The trigger efficiency as a function of triggering LLP particle-level p T is shown in Fig. 1 (left) for two signal samples. Only LLPs decaying in the HCal are considered in this plot. The high-E T CalRatio trigger, which is seeded by the high-E T L1 trigger, starts to be efficient for LLPs with p T > 100 GeV and reaches its plateau at 150-200 GeV. The low-E T CalRatio trigger (seeded by the low-E T L1 trigger) recovers efficiency for a large portion of the LLPs with p T < 100 GeV. The main source of efficiency loss in these triggers comes from the track isolation, followed by the combination of requirements on jet E T and E H /E EM . Fig. 1 (right) shows the LLP p T distribution for all the signal samples considered in the analysis. The combination of these figures shows how the high-E T CalRatio trigger gives a higher efficiency for models with m > 200 GeV, where the LLP p T distributions peak between 150 and 500 GeV. For signal models with m up to 200 GeV, the LLP p T distributions peak between 30 and 100 GeV and hence the low-E T CalRatio trigger performs better. Thus, low-m models are searched for using the low-E T dataset: despite the reduced integrated luminosity, a higher sensitivity is obtained than if The trigger efficiency also depends strongly on the LLP decay position, as shown for three samples of simulated signal events in Fig. 2. The efficiency as a function of LLP decay length in the x-y plane is shown for LLPs decaying in the barrel (|\u03b7| < 1.4); the efficiency as a function of the decay position in the z-direction is shown for LLPs decaying in the HCal endcaps (1.4 \u2264 |\u03b7| < 2.5).

For this reason, and to obtain an optimal signal-to-background discrimination at all p T , two versions of the per-event BDT are trained: one for the analysis of the high-E T dataset, and another for the low-E T dataset. They only differ in the signal samples used for training and in the triggers required to select events. The high-E T per-event BDT training uses a combination of low-, intermediate-and high-mass signal samples in events passing the high-E T CalRatio trigger. The low-E T per-event BDT training uses a combination of low-m signal samples and only events passing the low-E T CalRatio trigger. Figure 5 shows the distribution of the per-event BDTs from five signal samples, as well as from the main data and BIB data. The BIB training sample contains SM multijet jets in addition to the BIB jet that caused them to be selected by the trigger. Consequently, even if no multijet sample is used in the training, the per-event BDT is able to discriminate signal from BIB as well as from multijet background. This can be seen in Fig. 5 by comparing the BDT results in the main data and the BIB datasets, especially in the low-E T per-event BDT output. Using time and z-coordinate measurements, it has been checked that events with low per-event BDT values (< \u2212 0.2) have the typical characteristics of BIB, while events with intermediate values (between \u2212 0.2 and 0.2) are multijet-like.",

These uncertainties are calculated using the Table 1 Sequential impact of each requirement on the number of events passing the selection for the high-E T (top) and low-E T (bottom) analyses. The quoted number for BIB corresponds to the number of events in the BIB dataset passing the selection. The number of events for the cosmic rays is estimated from the cosmic-ray dataset by applying cor-rections for the proportion of empty crossings relative to filled crossings, and a factor to account for the change in analysis efficiency in a zeropile-up collision. Signal yields are quoted as a percentage of the total number of generated events  procedure detailed in Ref. [65]. Since the jets used in this analysis are required to have a low fraction of calorimeter energy in the ECal, the jet-energy uncertainties are rederived as a function of ECal energy fraction as well as of \u03b7. The additional jet-energy uncertainties are found to have an effect of up to 17% on the signal yield, and are conservatively taken in quadrature with the regular jetenergy uncertainties. The lower-m models are more sensitive to all jet-energy uncertainties than the higher-m models. The uncertainty in the signal trigger efficiency is estimated by studying how well modelled the three main HLT variables (jet E T and log 10 (E H /E EM ), and p T of tracks within the jet) are between HLT-and offline-reconstructed quantities in data and Monte Carlo (MC) simulation. A tagand-probe technique using standard jet triggers is used to obtain a pure sample of multijet events in both data and MC simulation. Scale factors are derived that represent the degree of mis-modelling in each variable, and are applied in an emulation of the CalRatio triggers. The change in yield relative to the nominal (unscaled) trigger emulation after the full analysis selection is taken as the size of the systematic uncertainty, which is 2% or less for all models.",

In this control sample, the distributions of the inputs and outputs of the per-jet and perevent BDTs were studied, and were found to agree fairly well between data and MC simulation. The residual differences are translated into a systematic uncertainty in the signal efficiency by randomly varying the input variables according to their uncertainty and re-evaluating the BDTs for each signal event.

An overall profile likelihood function is constructed from the product of the Poisson probabilities of observing the number of events N obs X , given an expectation N exp X , in each region X , where X = A, B, C, D. The value of N exp X in each region is the sum of: the expected signal yield N sig X , given by the number of simulated signal events entering region X multiplied by the signal strength \u03bc (the parameter of interest); and the expected background yield N bkg X . In the fit, the expected background yields are constrained to obey the ABCD relation N reduces the number of degrees of freedom of the fit by one as N obs A m is a free parameter. Since the Poisson constraints only apply to N obs X relative to N exp X , it follows that the background prediction may change dynamically in the fit as a function of the signal strength.",
