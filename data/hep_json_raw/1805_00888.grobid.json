Each experiment has unique advantages: Belle and BaBar produce boosted charmed hadrons in a low-background e + e \u2212 environment; LHCb produces very large event samples due the large cc production cross section in hadron collisions; and BESIII produces DD meson pairs in a quantum-correlated state at threshold with very little background. Here we review recent results from all four experiments. The measurements can be grouped into six areas: measurements of charm mixing, indirect (time-dependent) CP violation, direct (time-integrated) CP violation, T violation, semileptonic and leptonic decays, and charm baryon decays. Our review highlights results that are sensitive to New Physics and thus can constrain extensions to the Standard Model (SM).",

The decay rates are measured in bins of q 2 , as shown in Fig. 5. The data points are fit to Eq. (8) using several theoretical models for f + (q 2 ); the floated parameters are the normalizations f K + (q 2 = 0) \u2022 |V cs | and f \u03c0 + (q 2 = 0) \u2022 |V cd |. Taking the form factor normalizations f K + (0) and f \u03c0 + (0) from lattice QCD calculations [46,47], one obtains |V cs | = 0.944 \u00b10.005 \u00b10.015 \u00b1 0.024 and |V cd | = 0.210 \u00b1 0.004 \u00b1 0.001 \u00b1 0.009, where the third error is due to theoretical uncertainty in the lattice calculations. These values are consistent with CKM unitarity (see below). Several other semileptonic decays have also been measured by BESIII, although no form factor calculations for these exist: D + \u2192 \u03c6(\u00b5 + , e + )\u03bd [48], 50], and the radiative leptonic decay D + \u2192 \u03b3e + \u03bd [51].

Finally, the most recent results for charm baryon decays are listed in Table 6. Although no statistically significant anomaly or \"smoking gun\" of new physics is seen, the precision of these results will be significantly improved with the analysis of LHCb Run 2 data and the large e + e \u2212 dataset to be collected by Belle II.
