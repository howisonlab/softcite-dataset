Electrons impinge upon a fixed target of high-Z material. An A is produced via a process analogous to photon bremsstrahlung, decaying to an e + e \u2212 pair. A test run was held in July of 2010, covering m A = 175 to 250 MeV and couplings g /e > 10 \u22123 . A full run is approved and will cover m A \u223c65 to 525 MeV and g /e > 2.3 \u00d7 10 \u22124 .",

For an extension of this model to have thus far evaded detection the corresponding gauge boson must have a mass of O(TeV) or must be very weakly coupled to ordinary matter, with a coupling strength g suppressed relative to the electromagnetic charge e by \u2261 g /e \u223c 10 \u22126 \u2212 10 \u22122 [1] (or, equivalently, / = 2 ). This new gauge boson, A , corresponding to a U(1) extension of the SM can acquire an effective interaction with electromagnetism via kinetic mixing, where quantum loops of arbitrarily heavy particles provide a means by which the hidden U(1) sector couples to the visible sector; see, e.g., [2][3][4]. The possibility of the existence of an A with a small EM charge can be tested at fixed target facilities such as the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (JLab). APEX, The A Prime EXperiment, searches for an A at JLab and is described in brief here. For a full description of the experiment see [5] and for a more detailed description of the results of the test run see [6].",

For a complete description of these constraints, see [8] and references therein. As seen in Fig. 1, APEX covers a large portion of this area of parameter space, from m A \u223c 65 to 525 MeV and with coupling reach to g /e > 2.3 \u00d7 10 \u22124 .
