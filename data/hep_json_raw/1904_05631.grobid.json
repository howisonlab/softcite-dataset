The data were collected in protonproton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV with the ATLAS experiment at the LHC and correspond to a total integrated luminosity of 20.2 fb \u22121 . The precision of the crosssection measurements varies between 0.8 and 1.5% as a function of the pseudorapidity, excluding the 1.9% uncertainty on the integrated luminosity. The charge asymmetry is measured with an uncertainty between 0.002 and 0.003. The results are compared with predictions based on next-to-next-to-leadingorder calculations with various parton distribution functions and have the sensitivity to discriminate between them.",

            "text": "Measurements of the W + and W \u2212 boson cross-sections in hadron collisions are a sensitive probe of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). High-precision predictions at next-to-nextto-leading-order (NNLO) accuracy in QCD are available to compare with data. Of particular interest is the ability of such measurements to discriminate between different parton distribution functions (PDFs) [1-7], because the W boson rapidity 1 y is strongly correlated with the initial-state parton 1 ATLAS uses a right-handed coordinate system with its origin at the nominal interaction point in the centre of the detector and the z-axis coinciding with the axis of the beam pipe. The x-axis points from the interaction point to the centre of the LHC ring, and the y-axis points upward. Polar coordinates (r , \u03c6) are used in the transverse plane, \u03c6 being the azimuthal angle around the beam pipe. The pseudorapidity is defined in terms of the polar angle \u03b8 as \u03b7 = \u2212 ln tan(\u03b8/2). The rapidity y of a system is defined in terms of its energy E and its longitudinal momentum p z as y = (1/2) ln[(E + p z )/(E \u2212 p z )]. Angular separations between particles or reconstructed objects are measured in \u03b7-\u03c6 space using R = ( \u03b7) 2 + ( \u03c6) 2 . e-mail: atlas.publications@cern.ch momentum fractions x. In high-energy proton-proton collisions, the main production mechanism of single W bosons is a valence quark annihilating with a sea antiquark. The W bosons are preferentially produced with a boost in the direction of the incoming valence quark, as the quark is more likely to be at a higher x than the corresponding antiquark. Since the PDFs of u and d quarks in the proton differ (largely due to there being two valence u quarks and one valence d quark), there is a production asymmetry between W + and W \u2212 bosons (referred to in this paper as the W boson charge asymmetry), which also varies as a function of rapidity. The boson rapidity cannot be determined unambiguously in leptonic decays of the W boson because the decay neutrino passes through the detector unobserved. The charge asymmetry can instead be measured as a function of the decay lepton's pseudorapidity \u03b7 , which is strongly correlated with the W boson rapidity.",

The Z \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 process was simulated using Alpgen [34] with the CTEQ6L1 PDF set [35] interfaced to Herwig [36] to simulate the parton shower and Jimmy [37] to model the underlying event. The single-top process in the s-channel and Wt-channels was simulated with MC@NLO [38] interfaced to Jimmy. The t-channel was generated with AcerMC [39] interfaced to Pythia. The backgrounds from the diboson processes W W , W Z, and Z Z were simulated using Herwig at leading order with the CTEQ6L1 PDF set. In all cases, the Geant4 [40] program was used to simulate the passage of particles through the ATLAS detector [41]. The multijet background is estimated using a data-driven technique, described in Sect. 3.4. A bb \u2192 \u03bcX MC sample, simulated using Pythia8 with the AU2 tune set, is used to cross-check the data-driven estimation.",

The muon reconstruction efficiencies are parameterised versus \u03b7 and \u03c6, the muon isolation efficiencies versus \u03b7 and transverse momentum p T , and the muon trigger efficiencies versus \u03b7, \u03c6, and p T . The reconstruction, trigger and isolation efficiencies are evaluated separately for positive and negative muons. This separate evaluation is particularly necessary in the case of the trigger efficiencies, which differ by up to 3% (depending on \u03b7) between positive and negative muons, much greater than the total uncertainty in the cross-section from other sources. Corrections are also applied to MC events for the description of the muon momentum scales and resolution, which are determined from fits to the observed mass distributions of Z \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc candidates in data and MC simulations [42]. To correct for charge-dependent biases of the muon momentum scale due to residual misalignments in the ID and MS, an additional momentum-dependent correction parameterised versus \u03b7 and \u03c6 is applied. An associated uncertainty corresponding to the full size of the correction is included.",

Multijet processes contribute between 2% and 4% of the selected data and are the largest sources of background for |\u03b7 \u03bc | 1.4. The number and properties of the background events arising from multijet processes are estimated using a data-driven template-fit technique, similar to that used in Ref. [58]. A multijet-dominated sample is obtained from data by selecting events passing the nominal selection except that the muon fails the isolation criterion. For this purpose, events satisfying a trigger without an isolation requirement are used. Multijet templates are constructed from this sample, in a series of mutually exclusive slices in muon isolation, for each distribution of interest. The residual contribution from signal and other background sources, estimated from MC simulations, is subtracted. The normalisations of the multijet templates in the signal region are obtained by fitting the templates to data in three discriminating variables: E miss T , m T , and the ratio p \u03bc T /m T . The fits are performed in two phase-space regions (fitting regions) in which the selections on E miss T and m T are relaxed in order to enrich the multijet background contribution. A requirement that the W transverse momentum be less than 30 GeV is introduced in one fitting region to remove a region poorly modelled by signal MC simulations. The normalisation of the multijet template is allowed to float in each of the fits and the total MC-based signal plus background is kept constant. The multijet normalisation in the signal selection is extracted using each discriminating variable in both fitting regions (a total of six estimates). It is assumed that the normalisations of the templates in the fitting regions are the same as for the signal selection. The fits described above are performed for each muon-isolation slice (i.e. six fits per slice). The normalisation estimate extracted in each muon-isolation slice (for a particular discriminating variable and fitting region) is used to linearly extrapolate to an isolation value of 0.05, which is the average isolation of multijet events in the signal region as estimated using the bb \u2192 \u03bcX MC simulation.",

The fit also has a statistical uncertainty, which is treated as being uncorrelated between charges and bins. This is largely due to the limited number of data events for the multijet templates passing the signal selection in each muon-isolation slice. The size of the multijet systematic uncertainty is reported in Sect. 4. The above procedure is performed separately in each bin of muon pseudorapidity. A summary of the most important backgrounds including systematic uncertainties is given in Table 1. Figure 1 shows the muon \u03b7, muon p T , and W transverse mass distributions of selected events with positive muons (left) and with negative muons (right). The data are compared with the sum of MC and data-based estimates for the signal and the backgrounds. The predictions are normalised to the luminosity of the data, after first normalising each MC cross-section to a corresponding higher-order prediction. A normalisation shift between data and MC simulations of approximately 1% is observed for the positive muon plots. This is covered by the uncertainty in the MC signal prediction due to the cross-section uncertainty. Otherwise, the combined prediction describes the data well and within the uncertainties.",

The difference between the dressed-level C W values obtained using the Powheg+Pythia8 and Sherpa simulations is statistically significant and assigned as a systematic uncertainty. This is labelled as 'Modelling' in Table 3. The dressed-level is defined by combining the four-momentum of each muon after photon FSR with that of photons radiated within a cone defined by R = 0.1 around the muon. This is one of the largest systematic uncertainties for both the cross-section (up to 1% at large |\u03b7 \u03bc |) and the asymmetry measurements. The uncertainty in the luminosity is 1.9% [18]. For the asymmetry, the uncertainty in the luminosity only affects the asymmetry measurement through negligible effects in the background estimation, and it is therefore considered fully correlated between the W + and W \u2212 samples.",

The muon and neutrino transverse momenta are required to be greater than 25 GeV and the W boson transverse mass to be greater than 40 GeV. A precision of 0.8-1.5% is achieved for the cross-section values, depending on the pseudorapidity, whilst an uncertainty between 0.002 and 0.003 (in absolute units) is obtained for the asymmetry. The integrated fiducial W \u00b1 production cross-sections are also determined. The measurements are compared to predictions at NNLO accuracy in QCD computed with the DYNNLO program. The precision of the measurement is better than both the uncertainties on the PDF sets as well as the spread between different sets, showing the sensitivity of the measurement to discriminate between them and serve as input to improve the knowledge on the proton structure. ation of the LHC, as well as the support staff from our institutions without whom ATLAS could not be operated efficiently.
