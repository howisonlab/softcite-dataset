In addition to the ground state \u00c3 0 b , the \u00c4 \u00c0 b baryon with the quark content bsd has been observed by the D0 [1] and CDF [2] Collaborations, followed by the observation of the doubly strange \u00c0 b baryon (bss) [3,4]. The last ground state of beauty-strange content, \u00c4 0 b (bsu), has been observed by CDF [5]. Recently, the CMS Collaboration has found the corresponding excited state, most likely \u00c4 \u00c30 b with J P \u00bc 3=2 \u00fe [6]. Beauty baryons with two light quarks (bqq, where q \u00bc u; d), other than the \u00c3 0 b , have been studied so far by CDF only. Of the triplets AE AE;0 b with spin J \u00bc 1=2 and AE \u00c3AE;0 b with J \u00bc 3=2 predicted by theory, only the charged states AE \u00f0\u00c3\u00deAE b have so far been observed via their decay to \u00c3 0 b % AE final states [7,8].
