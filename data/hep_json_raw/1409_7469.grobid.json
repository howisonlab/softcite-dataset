T2K will have sensitivity to the CP-violating phase \u03b4 CP at 90% C.L. or better over a significant range. For example, if sin 2 2\u03b8 23 is maximal (i.e. \u03b8 23 = 45 \u2022 ) the range is \u2212115 \u2022 < \u03b4 CP < \u221260 \u2022 for normal hierarchy and +50 \u2022 < \u03b4 CP < +130 \u2022 for inverted hierarchy. When T2K data is combined with data from the NO\u03bdA experiment, the region of oscillation parameter space where there is sensitivity to observe a non-zero \u03b4 CP is substantially increased compared to if each experiment is analyzed alone.

The observation of a zenith-angle-dependent deficit in muon neutrinos produced by high-energy proton interactions in the atmosphere [1] confirmed the neutrino flavor oscillation hypothesis. The \"anomalous\" solar neutrino flux [2] problem was shown to be due to neutrino oscillation by more precise measurements [3][4][5][6]. Atmospheric neutrino measurements have provided further precision on the disappearance of muon neutrinos [7,8] and the appearance of tau neutrinos [9]. Taking advantage of nuclear reactors as intense sources, the disappearance of electron antineutrinos has been firmly established using both widely distributed multiple sources at an average distance of 180 km [6] and from specialized detectors placed within \u223c2 km [10][11][12]. The development of high-intensity proton accelerators that can produce focused neutrino beams with mean energy from a few hundred MeV to tens of GeV have enabled measurements of the disappearance of muon neutrinos (and muon antineutrinos) [8,13,14] and appearance of electron neutrinos (and electron antineutrinos) [15][16][17][18] and tau neutrinos [19] over distances of hundreds of kilometers.",

There is one irreducible phase, \u03b4 CP , allowed in a unitary 3 \u00d7 3 mixing matrix. 1 After neutrinos propagate through vacuum, the probability that they will interact via one of the three flavors will depend on the values of these mixing angles. As neutrinos propagate through matter, coherent forward scattering of electron neutrinos causes a change in the effective neutrino mass that leads to a modification of the oscillation probability. This is the so-called matter effect. Interference between multiple terms in the transition probability can lead to CP violation in neutrino mixing if the phase \u03b4 CP is non-zero. For T2K, the neutrino oscillation modes of interest are the \u03bd \u03bc \u2192 \u03bd e appearance mode and the \u03bd \u03bc disappearance mode. The \u03bd \u03bc \u2192 \u03bd e appearance oscillation probability (to first order approximation in the matter effect [24]) is given by P(\u03bd \u03bc \u2192 \u03bd e ) = 4C 2 13 S 2 13 S 2 23 sin 2  ",

The equivalent expression for antineutrino appearance,\u03bd \u03bc \u2192\u03bd e , is obtained by reversing the signs of terms proportional to sin \u03b4 CP and a. The first and fourth terms of Eq. (3) come from oscillations induced by \u03b8 13 and \u03b8 12 , respectively, in the presence of non-zero \u03b8 23 . The second and third terms come from interference caused by these oscillations. At the T2K peak energy of \u223c0.6 GeV and baseline length of L = 295 km, cos 32 is nearly zero and the second and fifth terms vanish. The fourth term, to which solar neutrino disappearance is attributed, is negligibly small. Hence, the dominant contribution for \u03bd e appearance in the T2K experiment comes from the first and third terms. The contribution from the matter effect is about 10% of the first term without the matter effect. Since the third term contains sin \u03b4 CP , it is called the \"CP-violating\" term. It is as large as 27% of the first term without the matter effect when sin \u03b4 CP = 1 and sin 2 2\u03b8 23 = 1, meaning that the CP-violating term makes a non-negligible contribution to the total \u03bd e appearance probability. The measurement of \u03b8 13 from the reactor experiments is independent of the CP phase, and future measurements from Daya Bay [10], Double Chooz [11], and RENO [12] will reduce the \u03b8 13 uncertainty such that the significance of the CP-violating term will be enhanced for T2K. It is also important to recognize that since the sign of the CP-violating term is opposite for neutrino and antineutrino oscillations, data taken by T2K with an antineutrino beam for comparison to neutrino data may allow us to study CP violation effects directly.",

Currently, the measured value of sin 2 2\u03b8 23 is consistent with full mixing, but more data are required to know if that is the case. If the mixing is not maximal, the \u03bd e appearance data, together with the \u03bd \u03bc disappearance data, have the potential to resolve the \u03b8 23 octant degeneracy because the first term of Eq. (3) is proportional to sin 2 \u03b8 23 . The NO\u03bdA experiment is similar to T2K in the basic goals to measure \u03bd \u03bc disappearance and \u03bd e appearance in an off-axis muon neutrino beam. The most important difference between the two experiments is the distance from the neutrino source to the far detector, 810 km for NO\u03bdA and 295 km for T2K, with a correspondingly higher peak neutrino beam energy for NO\u03bdA to maximize the appearance probability. NO\u03bdA is projected to have similar sensitivity compared to T2K for \u03b8 23 , \u03b8 13 , and \u03b4 CP , but better sensitivity to the sign of m 2 32 since, as can be seen in a in Eq. 3, the size of the matter effect is proportional to the distance L. The combination of results from the two experiments at different baselines will further improve the sensitivity to the sign of m 2 32 and to \u03b4 CP . In this paper we present the updated T2K sensitivity to neutrino oscillation parameters using a large value of sin 2 2\u03b8 13 similar to that measured by the reactor experiments, together with the sensitivity when projected T2K and NO\u03bdA results are combined.",

The rate and spectrum depend on the oscillation parameters, the incident neutrino flux, neutrino interaction cross sections, and the detector response. The initial estimate of the neutrino flux is determined from detailed simulations incorporating proton beam measurements, INGRID measurements, and pion and kaon production measurements from the NA61/SHINE [33,34] experiment. The ND280 detector measurement of \u03bd \u03bc charged current (CC) events is used to constrain the initial flux estimates and parameters of the neutrino interaction models that affect the predicted rate and spectrum of neutrino interactions at both ND280 and Super-K. At Super-K, \u03bd e and \u03bd \u03bc charged current quasi-elastic (CCQE) events, for which the neutrino energy can be reconstructed using simple kinematics, are selected. Efficiencies and backgrounds are determined through detailed simulations tuned to control samples which account for final state interactions (FSI) inside the nucleus and secondary hadronic interactions (SI) in the detector material. These combined results are used in a fit to determine the oscillation parameters.",

Then, critical \u03c7 2 values for Gaussian distributed variables ( \u03c7 2 critical ) can be used for determining confidence level (C.L.) regions [36]. Each simulated spectrum is generated at the MC sample statistical mean, and therefore the results of this test represent the median sensitivity. Thus the results of these studies indicate that half of experiments are expected to be able to reject H 0 at the reported C.L. This is accurate if two conditions are met: (1) the probability density function (pdf) for \u03c7 2 follows a true \u03c7 2 distribution, and (2) the \u03c7 2 value calculated with the MC sample statistical mean spectra (\u00af \u03c7 2 ) is equivalent to the median of the \u03c7 2 pdf. Then,\u00af \u03c7 2 can be used to construct median sensitivity C.L. contours. Studies using ensembles of toy MC experiments where statistical fluctuations expected at a given POT and systematic fluctuations are included have shown that calculating C.L.s by applying a \u03c7 2 critical value to \u03c7 2 gives fairly consistent C.L.s, and that\u00af \u03c7 2 is in good agreement with the median \u03c7 2 value of each ensemble of toy MC experiments, except in the case of a mass hierarchy determination. Therefore, in this paper we show C.L.s constructed by applying the \u03c7 2 critical value to\u00af \u03c7 2 as our median sensitivity. The exception of the MH case will be discussed in detail in Sect. 5.",

A contour consisting of the outermost edge of all contours in each plot can be considered as the T2K sensitivity assuming an unknown MH. For the sake of brevity, only results assuming true NH are shown; similar conclusions can be drawn from plots assuming true IH.

Figure 7 shows the expected \u03c7 2 for the sin \u03b4 CP = 0 hypothesis, for various true values of \u03b4 CP and sin 2 \u03b8 23 . To see the dependence more clearly, \u03c7 2 is plotted as a function of \u03b4 CP for various values of sin 2 \u03b8 23 in Fig. 8 (normal MH case) and Fig. 9 (inverted MH case). For favorable sets of the oscillation parameters and mass hierarchy, T2K will have greater than 90% C.L. sensitivity to non-zero sin \u03b4 CP . Figures 10 and 11 show the sin 2 \u03b8 23 vs. \u03b4 CP regions where T2K has more than a 90% C.L. sensitivity to reject maximal mixing or reject one octant of \u03b8 23 . In each of these figures, the oscillation parameters \u03b4 CP , sin 2 2\u03b8 13 , sin 2 \u03b8 23 , m 2 32 , and the MH are considered unknown and a constraint based on the ultimate reactor error is used. Note that the T2K sensitivity to reject maximal mixing PTEP 2015, 043C01 K. Abe et al. is roughly independent of \u03bd-\u03bd running ratio, while the sensitivity to reject one octant is better when \u03bdand\u03bd-modes are combined. Again, the combination of \u03bdand\u03bd-modes, as well as the tight constraint on \u03b8 13 from the reactor measurement, are all required to resolve the correct values for the parameters sin 2 \u03b8 23 , sin 2 2\u03b8 13 , and \u03b4 CP from many possible solutions. Resolving the values of these three oscillation parameters is required in order to also resolve the \u03b8 23 octant. These figures show that by running with a significant amount of\u03bd-mode, T2K has sensitivity to the CP-violating term and octant of \u03b8 23 for a wider region of oscillation parameters (\u03b4 CP , \u03b8 23 ) and for both mass hierarchies, particularly when systematic errors are taken into account.

The precision includes either statistical errors only, statistical errors combined with the 2012 systematic errors, or statistical errors 14/36  combined with conservatively projected systematic errors for the full POT. See Sect. 4.5 for details about the projected systematic errors used. Generally, the effect of the systematic errors is reduced by running with combined \u03bd-mode and \u03bd-mode. When running 50% in \u03bd-mode and 50% in\u03bd-mode, the statistical 1 \u03c3 uncertainty of sin 2 \u03b8 23 and m 2 32 is 0.045 and 0.04 \u00d7 10 \u22123 eV 2 , respectively, at the T2K full statistics. It should be noted that the sensitivity to sin 2 \u03b8 23 shown here for the current exposure (6.57 \u00d7 10 20 POT) is significantly worse than the most recent T2K result [14], and in fact the recent result is quite close to the final sensitivity (at 7.8 \u00d7 10 21 POT) shown. This apparent discrepancy comes from three factors. About half of the difference between the expected sensitivity and observed result is due to an apparent statistical fluctuation, where fewer T2K \u03bd \u03bc events have been observed than expected. Of the remaining difference, half comes from the use of a Feldman-Cousins statistical analysis for the T2K official oscillation result which this sensitivity study does not use. The rest comes from the location of the best-fit point: the expected error depends on the true value of sin 2  sin 2 2\u03b8 13 = 0.1, increases the full width of the \u03c7 2 curve such that the farther the true point is from maximal disappearance, the larger the error on sin 2 \u03b8 23 becomes (where the studies here assume a true value of sin 2 \u03b8 23 slightly lower than the point of maximal disappearance, sin 2 \u03b8 23 = 0.5). Therefore, if results from future running continue to favor maximal disappearance we expect modest improvements in our current constraints, eventually approaching a value close to, and possibly slightly better than, the predicted final sensitivity shown here. Figure 13 shows the sin 2 \u03b8 23 region where maximal mixing or one of the \u03b8 23 octants can be rejected, as a function of POT in the case of 50% \u03bdplus 50%\u03bd-mode running. Although these plots are made under the condition that the true mass hierarchy is normal and \u03b4 CP = 0 \u2022 , dependence on these conditions is moderate in the case of 50% \u03bdplus 50%\u03bd-mode running.",

In this case the systematic error on the predicted number of events in Super-K is about 7% for the \u03bd \u03bc and \u03bd e samples and about 14% for the\u03bd \u03bc and\u03bd e samples. These errors were calculated by reducing the 2012 oscillation analysis errors by removing certain interaction model and cross section uncertainties from both the \u03bd e -and \u03bd \u03bc -mode errors, and by additionally scaling all \u03bd \u03bc -mode errors down by a factor of two. Errors for the\u03bd \u03bc -and\u03bd e -modes were estimated to be twice those of the \u03bd \u03bc -and \u03bd e -modes, respectively. These reduced \u03bd-mode errors are in fact very close to the errors used for the oscillation results reported by T2K in 2014, where the T2K oscillation analysis errors have similarly been reduced by improvements in understanding the relevant interactions and cross sections. For the measurement of \u03b4 CP , studies have shown that it is desirable to reduce this to 5% \u223c 8% for the \u03bd e sample and \u223c10% for the\u03bd e sample to maximize the T2K sensitivity with full statistics. The measurement of \u03b4 CP is nearly independent of the size of the error on the \u03bd \u03bc and\u03bd \u03bc samples as long as we can achieve uncertainty on\u03bd \u03bc similar to the current uncertainty on \u03bd \u03bc . For the measurement of \u03b8 23 and m 2 32 , the systematic error sizes are significant compared to the statistical error, and the result would benefit from systematic error reduction even for uncertainties as small as 5%.",

            "text": "The ability of T2K to measure the value of \u03b4 CP (or determine if CPV exists in the lepton sector) is greatly enhanced by the determination of the MH. This enhancement results from the nearly degenerate \u03bd e appearance event rate predictions at Super-K in the normal hierarchy with positive values of \u03b4 CP compared to the inverted hierarchy with negative values of \u03b4 CP . Determination of the MH thus breaks the degeneracy, enhancing the \u03b4 CP resolution for \u223c50% of \u03b4 CP values. T2K does not have sufficient sensitivity to determine the mass hierarchy by itself. The NO\u03bdA experiment [23], which started operating in 2014, has a longer baseline (810 km) and higher peak neutrino energy (\u223c2 GeV) than T2K. Accordingly, the impact of the matter effect on the predicted far detector event spectra is larger in NO\u03bdA \u223c 30%) than in T2K (\u223c10%), leading to a greater sensitivity to the mass hierarchy. Because of the complementary nature of these two experiments, better constraints on the oscillation parameters, \u03b4 CP , sin 2 \u03b8 23 , and the MH can be obtained by comparing the \u03bd \u03bc \u2192 \u03bd e oscillation probability of the two experiments. To evaluate the benefit of combining the two experiments, we have developed a code based on GLoBES [38,39]. The studies using projected T2K and NO\u03bdA data samples show the full physics reach for the two experiments, individually and combined, along with studies aimed at optimization of the \u03bd-mode to\u03bd-mode running ratios of the two experiments. Figure 15 shows the relation between the expected number of events of T2K and NO\u03bdA for various values of \u03b4 CP , sin 2 \u03b8 23 , and mass hierarchies. The NH and IH predictions occupy distinct regions in the plot suggesting how a combined analysis T2K-NO\u03bdA fit leads to increased sensitivity. However, this plot does not include the (statistical + systematic) uncertainties on measurements of these event rates. This would result in regions of overlap where the MH cannot be determined, and the sensitivity to \u03b4 CP is degraded. In order to evaluate the effect of combining the results from T2K and NO\u03bdA quantitatively, we have conducted a T2K-NO\u03bdA combined sensitivity study. The GLoBES [38,39] software package was used to fit oscillation parameters based on the reconstructed neutrino energy spectra of the two experiments. The fits were conducted by minimizing \u03c7 2 which is calculated from spectra generated with different sets of oscillation parameters, and includes penalty terms for deviations of the signal and background normalizations from nominal. The best-fit \u03c7 by GLoBES was the metric chosen to characterize sensitivity, as it is related to the probability that a given data set can result from two different hypotheses. GLoBES combines flux, cross section, energy resolution/bias, and efficiency information for an experiment to estimate energy spectra of neutrino interaction samples used for analyses. Then GLoBES uses a full three-flavor oscillation probability formulation to fit analysis spectra generated assuming different oscillation parameters to each other (varying oscillation parameter values and parameters accounting for systematic uncertainties within their uncertainties). The oscillation parameters, unless otherwise stated, are those shown in Table 2. The GLoBES three-flavor analysis package works very similarly to the fitter used for the studies presented in Sect. 4. Several validation studies were done to ensure that the two methods produced the same results when given the same inputs.",

Since NO\u03bdA has only recently begun taking data, detailed evaluation of systematic uncertainties is not yet published. Therefore, the combined sensitivity studies used a simplified systematics treatment for both T2K and NO\u03bdA: a 5% normalization uncertainty on signal events and a 10% normalization uncertainty on background events for both appearance and disappearance spectra. Uncertainties that impact the spectral shape are not considered. This is a reasonable choice since both experiments use a narrow-band beam and much of the oscillation sensitivity comes from the measured event rates. The uncertainties are assumed to be uncorrelated for \u03bd e appearance,\u03bd e appearance, \u03bd \u03bc disappearance, and\u03bd \u03bc disappearance. This simple systematics implementation, referred to in the rest of the paper as \"normalization systematics,\" is the same as that adopted in the NO\u03bdA TDR and is also a reasonable representation of the projected uncertainties at T2K.

Relation between the expected number of \u03bd e +\u03bd e signal events produced by neutrino-mode running and antineutrino-mode running in T2K and NO\u03bdA, for various values of \u03b4 CP , sin 2 \u03b8 23 , and mass hierarchy. In the plot of predicted T2K rate versus the predicted NO\u03bdA rate (left) the blue (IH) and red (NH) upper bands are for neutrino-mode running while the red (NH) and blue (IH) bottom bands are for the antineutrino-mode running. The predicted number of \u03bd e +\u03bd e events produced in neutrino-mode running versus events produced in antineutrino-mode running (right) are shown for T2K in red (NH) and blue (IH), and for NO\u03bdA in green (NH) and magenta (IH). Representative points at the edges of the \u03b4 CP and sin 2 \u03b8 23 ranges are highlighted. Systematic and statistical uncertainties are not included. Table 6. Expected number of \u03bd e appearance signal and background events for NO\u03bdA at 1.8 \u00d7 10 21 POT for each of the \u03bd and\u03bd modes. * The oscillation probabilities used to calculate the predicted number of events assumed sin 2 2\u03b8 13 = 0.095 and do not include the solar oscillation terms or matter effects. In Figures 20 and 21 the \u03c7 2 for sin \u03b4 CP = 0 and for each MH is plotted as a function of \"true\" \u03b4 CP in the case of sin 2 (\u03b8 23 ) = 0.5. The \"true\" value of sin 2 (\u03b8 23 ) = 0.5 was chosen to present a simplified view of the sensitivities for maximal mixing. The T2K's \u03c7 2 is smaller at \u03b4 CP = +90 \u2022 (\u221290 \u2022 ) compared to that at the opposite sign of \u03b4 CP = \u221290 \u2022 (+90 \u2022 ) for the NH (IH) case while those are similar for NO\u03bdA. This comes from the large degeneracy between the CP-violating term and the matter effect for T2K. In the case of NO\u03bdA, the matter effect is large enough that the degenerate parameters space is much smaller, as can be seen in Fig. 15. The complex structure for positive (negative) values of \u03b4 CP with a true NH (IH) is also due to the fact that \u03c7 2 calculation profiles over MH, and the expected number of \u03bd e appearance events, is nearly degenerate in these regions. T2K would perform better than or comparable to NO\u03bdA if the MH was assumed to be known. However, there is no experiment, besides NO\u03bdA, that expects to determine the MH on the relevant time scale, thus the case of a known MH is not presented. These figures demonstrate the sensitivity of the two experiments, as well as the benefit of combined analysis of the two data sets on the ability to determine MH and CPV.    ",

These values are computed from studies like the ones presented in Fig. 20. The sin \u03b4 CP = 0 median \u03c7 2 value at 1:0 T2K, 5:5 NO\u03bdA running is the median \u03c7 2 from Fig. 20(a) ( \u03c7 2 = 2.6). Figure 24 summarizes the data in Fig. 22 and compares it with the metric calculated for T2K-only running. The black curve gives the lowest \u03c7 2 for MH determination in a combined, T2K + NO\u03bdA, fit as a function of T2K \u03bd:\u03bd running ratio with the NO\u03bdA running fixed at 1:1. As shown previously, the T2K data set alone has almost no sensitivity to the MH determination. The curves for 5:5 NO\u03bdA running with systematics (black dashed) shows an optimal T2K running ratio of around 6:4 for a combined fit. However, the metric is very flat with respect to the T2K \u03bd:\u03bd run ratio for \u03bd running 29/36 greater than 50%. Figure 25 shows the summary for median \u03c7 2 for sin \u03b4 CP = 0. T2K run ratios between 1:0 and 5:5 produce relatively similar values of median \u03c7 2 for the combined fit. This is also true for combined T2K + NO\u03bdA running independent of the NO\u03bdA run plan optimization. There is a slight preference for all neutrino running in T2K in the combined fit. Figures 26 and 27 summarize the \u03b4 CP 1 \u03c3 width at various values of \u03b4 CP . Again, relatively similar values of \u03b4 CP 1 \u03c3 width are expected for the T2K run ratios between 1:0 and 1:9.",

These results are consistent with several other studies not shown in this paper (e.g. the measures of the precision on sin 2 \u03b8 13 in \u03bd-mode and in\u03bd-mode). The results are also robust with respect to reasonable variations in sin 2 \u03b8 23 , \u03b4 CP , and the MH. Thus, the results suggest that T2K run with a \u03bd-mode to\u03bd-mode at ratio of 1:1 with an allowed variation of \u00b120% of the total exposure. The variation can be used to PTEP 2015, 043C01 K. Abe et al.   with equal exposure of \u03bd-mode and\u03bd-mode and using signal efficiency from the 2012 analysis we project a data set of approximately 100 \u03bd e and 25\u03bd e appearance events and 390 (270) \u03bd \u03bc and 130 (70)\u03bd \u03bc CCQE (CC non-QE) events. From these data, with the projected systematic uncertainties we would achieve a 1 \u03c3 resolution of 0.050 (0.054) on sin 2 \u03b8 23 and 0.040 (0.045) \u00d7 10 \u22123 eV 2 on m 2",
