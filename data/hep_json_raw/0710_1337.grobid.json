They require a Flavor Changing Neutral Current (FCNC) process which can only occur through higher order Feynman diagrams. Processes beyond the standard model can contribute to those decays and significantly modify the decay rates. Any sizable deviation of the measurement from the SM prediction would indicate new physics phenomena. In these proceedings we present the current searches of the CDF Collaboration for the branching ratios of the rare decays B 0 (s,d)",

Search for the rare decays B 0 (s,d) \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 The SM predictions for the branching ratios of the decays B 0 s,d \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 are of the order of 10 \u221210 \u2212 10 \u22129 [3]. These low rates can not be probed at the Tevatron yet. However, new physics models like supersymmetry can enhance those ratios to a level that can be observed by the Tevatron experiments. The analysis uses 2 fb \u22121 of data [4], selected by the CDF dimuon trigger. The CDF muon system consists of several different components, most notably the central muon system (CMU), covering the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| \u2264 0.6, and the central muon extension (CMX), covering 0.6 \u2264 |\u03b7| \u2264 1.0. The dimuon trigger system requires at least one muon in the CMU. The two resulting trigger possibilities, CMU-CMU and CMU-CMX, have different acceptances and detector efficiencies, so that they will be treated separately during the analysis. After the application of some baseline cuts, the selection of B  The optimal search strategy is determined using the a priori expected 95% C.L. upper limit as figure of merit. The search window is divided into 15 regions -5 mass bins times 3 NN output bins. The observed number of events is compatible with the estimated background. Combinatoric background is estimated by sideband interpolation and the contribution from misidentified hadronic B 0 s,d decays is obtained by a combination of data and simulation. The limit on the branching fraction is obtained by normalizing to the well-measured B + \u2192 J/\u03c8K + decay. After combining all 15 regions, the CMU-CMU and CMU-CMX modes and using the world average value for B(B + \u2192 J/\u03c8K + ) [5], we obtain the 90%",

Each branching fraction is determined by the corresponding resonant B \u2192 J/\u03c8h mode for normalization, resulting in a cancellation of many systematic uncertainties. After some baseline cuts and the removal of resonant dimuon contributions the selection is optimized using the following variables: the proper decay time significance ct/\u03c3 ct , the pointing angle from the B meson candidate to the primary vertex and the isolation of the B meson candidate. The figure of merit in the optimization process is S/ \u221a S + B, with S the expected signal yield, determined from the normalization modes, and B the expected background yield.
