The correlation functions as well as the extracted source radii scale with event multiplicity and pair momentum. When analyzed in the same multiplicity and pair transverse momentum range, the correlation is similar at the two collision energies. A three-dimensional femtoscopic analysis shows an increase of the emission zone with increasing event multiplicity as well as decreasing homogeneity lengths with increasing transverse momentum. The latter trend gets more pronounced as multiplicity increases. This suggests the development of space-momentum correlations, at least for collisions producing a high multiplicity of particles. We consider these trends in the context of previous femtoscopic studies in high-energy hadron and heavyion collisions and discuss possible underlying physics mechanisms. Detailed analysis of the correlation reveals an exponential shape in the outward and longitudinal directions, while the sideward remains a Gaussian. This is interpreted as a result of a significant contribution of strongly decaying resonances to the emission region shape. Significant nonfemtoscopic correlations are observed, and are argued to be the consequence of ''mini-jet''-like structures extending to low p t . They are well reproduced by the Monte-Carlo generators and seen also in \u00fe \u00c0 correlations.",

These collisions provide a unique opportunity to probe Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) in the new energy regime. The distinguishing feature of QCD is the mechanism of color confinement, the physics of which is not fully understood, due, in part, to its theoretical intractability [1]. The confinement mechanism has a physical scale of the order of the proton radius and is especially important at low momentum. The study presented in this work aims to measure the space-time extent of the source on this scale.",

Goldhaber, W. Lee, and A. Pais 50 years ago [2]. Since then, they were studied in e \u00fe \u00fe e \u00c0 [3], hadron-and leptonhadron [4], and heavy-ion [5] collisions. Especially in the latter case, two-particle femtoscopy has been developed into a precision tool to probe the dynamically-generated geometry structure of the emitting system. In particular, a sharp phase transition between the color-deconfined and confined states was precluded by the observation of short time scales, and femtoscopic measurement of bulk collective flow proved that a strongly self-interacting system was created in the collision [6,7].",

But overviews [3,4,9] of femtoscopic measurements in hadron-and lepton-induced collisions reveal systematics surprisingly similar to those mentioned above for heavyion collisions. Moreover, in the first direct comparison of femtoscopy in heavy-ion collisions at Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC) and proton collisions in the same apparatus an essentially identical multiplicity-and momentum dependence was reported in the two systems [10]. However, the multiplicities at which the femtoscopic measurement in pp collisions at RHIC was made were still significantly smaller than those in even the most peripheral heavy-ion collisions. In this work we are, for the first time, able to compare femtoscopic radii measured in pp and heavy-ion collisions at comparable event multiplicities. At these multiplicities the observed correlations may be influenced by jets [11] while other studies suggest that a system behaving collectively may be created [12,13].",

In this work we explored this dependence by using high statistics data and more multiplicity ranges.

Approximately 8 \u00c2 10 6 events, triggered by a minimum-bias trigger at the injection energy of ffiffi ffi s p \u00bc 0:9 TeV, and 100 \u00c2 10 6 events with similar trigger at the maximum LHC energy to date, ffiffi ffi s p \u00bc 7 TeV, were analyzed in this work. The ALICE Time Projection Chamber (TPC) [17] was used to record charged-particle tracks as they left ionization trails in the Ne \u00c0 CO 2 gas. The ionization drifts up to 2.5 m from the central electrode to the end caps to be measured on 159 padrows, which are grouped into 18 sectors; the position at which the track crossed the padrow was determined with resolutions of 2 mm and 3 mm in the drift and transverse directions, respectively. The momentum resolution is $1% for pions with p t \u00bc 0:5 GeV=c. The ALICE Inner Tracking System (ITS) was also used for tracking. It consists of six silicon layers, two innermost Silicon Pixel Detector (SPD) layers, two Silicon Drift Detector (SDD) layers, and two outer Silicon Strip Detector (SSD) layers, which provide up to six space points for each track. The tracks used in this analysis were reconstructed using the information from both the TPC and the ITS; such tracks were also used to reconstruct the primary vertex of the collision. For details of this procedure and its efficiency see [18]. The forward scintillator detectors VZERO are placed along the beam line at \u00fe3 m and \u00c00:9 m from the nominal interaction point. They cover a region 2:8 < < 5:1 and \u00c03:7< < \u00c01:7, respectively. They were used in the minimumbias trigger and their timing signal was used to reject the beam-gas and beam-halo collisions.",

The quality of the track is determined by the 2 =N value for the Kalman fit to the reconstructed position of the TPC clusters (N is the number of clusters attached to the track); the track is rejected if the value is larger than 4.0 (2 degrees of freedom per cluster). Tracks with jj < 1:2 are taken for the analysis. The p t of accepted particles has a lower limit of 0:13 GeV=c because tracks with lower p t do not cross enough padrows in the TPC. The efficiency of particle reconstruction is about 50% at this lowest limit and then quickly increases and reaches a stable value of approximately 80% for p t > 0:2 GeV=c. In order to reduce the number of secondary particles in our sample, we require the track to project back to the primary interaction vertex within 0:018 \u00fe 0:035p \u00c01:01 t cm in the transverse plane and 0.3 cm in the longitudinal direction (so-called Distance of Closest Approach or DCA selection). ALICE provides an excellent particle identification capability through the combination of the measurement of the specific ionization (dE=dx) in the TPC and the ITS and the timing signals in the ALICE Time Of Flight (TOF). In the momentum range covered here (0:13 GeV=c to 0:7 GeV=c) pions constitute the majority of particles. We use only the TPC measurement for Particle Identification (PID) in this work, as the other detectors offer significant improvement at higher p t than used here. This PID procedure results in a small contamination of the pion sample by electrons at p t < 0:2 GeV=c and kaons at p t > 0:65 GeV=c. Allowing other particles into our sample has only a minor effect of lowering the strength of the correlation (the parameter), while it does not affect the femtoscopic radius, so we do not correct for it explicitly. The amount of electron contamination is less than 5%; kaons contaminate the pion sample for p > 0:6 GeV=c; their fraction is less than 10%.",

For the multiplicity determination we counted the tracks reconstructed simultaneously in the ITS and the TPC, plus the tracks reconstructed only in the ITS in case the track was outside of the TPC acceptance. The total number of events accepted after applying the selection criteria in the ffiffi ffi s p \u00bc 7 TeV sample was 60 \u00c2 10 6 and in the ffiffi ffi s p \u00bc 0:9 TeV sample it was 4:42 \u00c2 10 6 . We divided the full multiplicity range into eight and four ranges for the two energies, respectively, in such a way that the like-charge pion pair multiplicity in each of them was comparable. Table I gives (a) values for the range of raw charged-particle multiplicity that was used to categorize the event, (b) the corresponding mean charge particle density hdN ch =di as well as (c) number of events and (d) the number of identical pion pairs in each range. The femtoscopic measurement requires the events to have at least one charged pion identified 1 and its momentum determined. We give the dN ch =d values in Table I for this event sample. We denote this value as hdN ch =dij N ch !1 ; its typical uncertainty is 10%. We note that for the lowest multiplicity this charged-particle density is biased towards higher values with respect to the full sample of inelastic events. The pair momentum k T ranges used in the analysis were (0.13, 0.2), (0.2, 0.3), (0.3, 0.4), (0.4, 0.5), (0.5, 0.6), \u00f00:6; 0:7\u00de GeV=c.",

We deal with pions, so the masses of the particles are fixed-in this case q reduces to a vector:q. The one-dimensional analysis is performed versus the magnitude of the invariant momentum difference q inv \u00bc jqj, in the PRF. The large available statistics for this work allowed us to perform a detailed analysis also for the three-dimensional functions. In forming them, we calculate the momentum difference in the LCMS and decompose thisq LCMS according to the Bertsch-Pratt [20,21] ''out-side-long'' (sometimes indicated by o, s, and l subscripts) parametrization. Here, q long is parallel to the beam, q out is parallel to the pair transverse momentum, and q side is perpendicular to q long and q out . If one wishes to compare the radii measured in the LCMS to R inv one needs to multiply one of the transverse radii in the LCMS (the one along the pair transverse momentum) by the Lorentz corresponding to the pair transverse velocity and then average the three radii. Therefore an R inv constant with momentum is consistent with the radii in the LCMS decreasing with momentum. Figure 1 shows one-dimensional projections of the three-dimensional correlation function C\u00f0q out ; q side ; q long \u00de onto the q out , q side , and q long axes, for \u00fe pairs from one of the multiplicity/k T ranges from the ffiffi ffi s p \u00bc 7 TeV sample. The function is normalized with a factor that is a result of the fit (the details of the procedure are described in Sec. III D); unity means no correlation. The one-dimensional projections, shown in Fig. 1, present a limited view of the three-dimensional structure of the correlation function. It is increasingly common to represent correlation functions in a harmonic analysis [22][23][24]; this provides a more complete representation of the three-dimensional structure of the correlation, a better diagnostic of nonfemtoscopic correlations [23], and a more direct relation to the shape of the source [25].

This is done for k T of \u00f00:2; 0:3\u00de GeV=c; the behavior in other k T ranges and at the lower collision energy is qualitatively the same. The narrowing of the correlation peak with increasing multiplicity is apparent, corresponding to the increase of the size of the emitting region. The behavior of the correlation function at large q is also changing, the low multiplicity baseline is not flat, goes below 1.0 around q \u00bc 1 GeV=c, and then rises again at larger q; for higher multiplicities the background becomes flatter at large q. In the Cartesian representation shown in Fig. 1, areas with no data points (acceptance holes) are seen in q out projection near q \u00bc 0:5 GeV=c and in q long above 0:6 GeV=c. Since q long is proportional to the difference of longitudinal momenta, its value is limited due to acceptance. In the out direction the hole appears due to a combination of lower p t cut off and the selected k T range. It can be simply understood as follows: For the projection in the upper panel of Fig. 1, we take the value of q side and q long small. The value of q side is proportional to the azimuthal angle difference, while q long is proportional to polar angle difference. For q side , q long \u00bc 0, q out is simply p t;2 \u00c0 p t;1 and k T is \u00f0p t;1 \u00fe p t;2 \u00de=2, where p t is no longer a two-vector but just a scalar. The particles are either fully aligned (both p t 's are positive or both are negative) or back-to-back (one p t is positive, the other negative). When we combine the lower p t cut off jp t j > 0:13 GeV=c and the k T selection 0:2 k T 0:3, it can be shown that some range of the q out values is excluded. This range will depend on the k T selection.",

At low k T the correlation appears to be dominated by the femtoscopic effect at q < 0:3 GeV=c and is flat at larger q. As k T grows, the femtoscopic peak broadens (corresponding to a decrease in size of the emitting region). In addition, a wide structure, extending up to 1:0 GeV=c in q for the highest k T range, appears. We analyze this structure in further detail later in this work. We also see that, according to expectations, the acceptance holes in the out and long region move as we change the k T range. Figure 5 shows the example of the correlation function, for the same multiplicity/k T range, for pp collisions at two collision energies. We note a similarity between the two functions; the same is seen for other k T 's and overlapping multiplicity ranges. The similarity is not trivial: changing the multiplicity by 50%, as seen in Fig. 2 or k T by 30% as seen in Fig. 3 has a stronger influence on the correlation function than changing the collision energy by an order of magnitude. We conclude that the main scaling variables for the correlation function are global event multiplicity and transverse momentum of the pair; the dependence on collision energy is small. The energy independence of the emission region size is the first important physics result of this work. We emphasize that it can be already drawn from the analysis of the correlation functions themselves, but we will also perform more qualitative checks and discussions when we report the fitted emission region sizes in Sec. IV.",

If these were of femtoscopic origin, they would correspond to an unusually small emission region size of 0.2 fm. We reported the observation of these structures in our previous analysis [14] at ffiffi ffi s p \u00bc 0:9 TeV, where they were interpreted as nonfemtoscopic correlations coming from mini-jet-like structures at p t < 1 GeV=c. Here we further analyze this hypothesis. In Fig. 6 we show the comparison of the correlation function at multiplicity 12 N ch 16 in an intermediate k T range, where the long-range correlations are apparent, to the Monte-Carlo (MC) calculation. The simulation used the PYTHIA generator [26], Perugia-0 tune [27] as input. In this model the enhanced pair production at small relative angle (which is equivalent to small q in the k T ranges considered here) is associated with soft parton fragmentation or mini-jets. The particles generated were propagated through the full simulation of the ALICE detector [17]. Then they were reconstructed and analyzed in exactly the same way as our real data, using the same multiplicity and k T ranges. The MC calculation does not include the wavefunction symmetrization for identical particles; hence, the absence of the femtoscopic peak at low q is expected. In the angle-averaged C 0 0 component a significant correlation structure is seen, up to 1 GeV=c, with a slope similar to the data outside of the peak at low q. Similarly, in the C 0 2 component a weak and wide correlation dip is seen around q \u00bc 0:5 GeV=c, which is also seen in the data. In MC, the correlation in C 0 2 disappears at lower q, while for the data it extends to much lower q, exactly where the femtoscopic peak is expected and seen in C 0 0 . Our hypothesis is that both the long-range peak in C 0 0 and the dip in C 0 2 are of a mini-jet origin. They need to be taken into account when fitting the correlation function from data, so that the femtoscopic peak can be properly extracted and characterized. The calculations were also carried out with a second Monte-Carlo, the PHOJET model [28,29], and gave similar results. The differences between the two models are reflected in the systematic error.",

We see trends that are consistent with the mini-jet hypothesis. The correlation is small or nonexistent for low p t (first k T range) and it grows strongly with p t . In Fig. 7 we show this structure for selected multiplicity/k T at both energies. At the highest k T the effect has the magnitude of 0.3 at low q, comparable to the height of the femtoscopic peak. The appearance of these correlations is the main limiting factor in the analysis of the k T dependence. We tried to analyze the correlations at k T higher than 0:7 GeV=c, but we were unable to obtain a meaningful femtoscopic result, because the mini-jet structure was dominating the correlation. The strength of the correlation decreases with growing multiplicity (as Dashed lines are Gaussian fits to the simulations to determine the background parameters (see text for details). expected), slower than 1=N ch , so that it is still significant at the highest multiplicity. We studied other tunes of the PYTHIA model and found that the Perugia-0 tune reproduces the mini-jet correlation structures best, which is why it is our choice. Its limitation though is a relatively small multiplicity reach, smaller than the one observed in data. As a result the MC calculation for our highest multiplicity range is less reliable-this is reflected in the systematic error.",

            "text": "Analyzing the shape of the underlying event correlation for identical particle pairs in MC is important; however, it does not ensure that the behavior of the correlation at very low q is reproduced well in MC. We compared the identical particle MC and data in the large q region, where the femtoscopic effect is expected to disappear, and found them to be very similar in all multiplicity/k T . However, if the mini-jet hypothesis is correct, the same phenomenon causes similar correlations to appear for nonidentical pions. The magnitude is expected to be higher than for identical pions because it is easier to produce an oppositely-charged pair from a fragmenting mini-jet than it is to create an identically-charged pair, due to local charge conservation. Moreover, the femtoscopic effect for nonidentical pions comes from the Coulomb interaction only. It is limited to very low q, below 0:1 GeV=c. It is therefore possible to test the low-q behavior of the mini-jet correlation with such correlations. In Fig. 8 we show the measured \u00fe \u00c0 correlation functions, in selected multiplicity/k T ranges, compared to the corresponding correlations from the same MC sample which was used to produce correlations in Fig. 7. The underlying event long-range correlation is well reproduced in the MC. We see some deviation in the lowest multiplicity range, which is taken into account in the systematic error estimation. At larger multiplicities the strength of the correlation is well reproduced. By comparing the three-dimensional function in SH we checked that the shape in three-dimensional q space is also in agreement between data and MC. The magnitude for nonidentical pions is slightly bigger than for identical pions, as expected. The femtoscopic Coulomb effect at q < 0:1 GeV=c is also visible. Another strong effect, even dominating at low multiplicity, are the peaks produced by the correlated pairs of pions coming from strong resonance decays. They do appear in the MC as well, but they are shifted and have different magnitude. This is the effect of the simplified treatment of resonance decays in PYTHIA, where phase space and final state rescattering are not taken into account. By analyzing some of the correlation functions in Fig. 8 we were able to identify signals from at least the following decays: two-body , f 0 , and f 2 mesons decays, three-body ! meson decay, and also possibly meson two-body decay. Some residual K 0 S weak decay pairs, which are not removed by our DCA selection, can also be seen. All of these contribute through the full q range \u00f00:0; 1:2\u00de GeV=c. This fact, in addition to the stronger mini-jet contribution to nonidentical (as compared to identical) correlations, makes the nonidentical correlation not suitable for the background estimation for identical pion pairs. We also note that there appears to be very rich physics content in the analysis of resonances decaying strongly in the \u00fe \u00c0 channel; however, we leave the investigation of this topic for separate studies.",

The SH representation of the data is shown as points; the result of the fit is a black dashed line. The femtoscopic component is shown as a blue dotted line, and the nonfemtoscopic background as green dash-dotted line.

A different functional form, with more pronounced structures at large emission separations, is needed to fully describe this excess. An attempt to find such a form is described in detail in Sec. IV C. Here we proceed with the Gaussian assumption, as it is standard in the field and it is necessary to use it for comparisons to other experiments and heavy-ion data.

The   radii shown in the Fig. 11 are the main results of this work. Let us now discuss many aspects of the data visible in this figure. First, the comparison between the radii for two energies, in the same multiplicity/k T ranges, reveals that they are universally similar at all multiplicities, all k T 's, and all directions. This confirms what we have already seen directly in the measured correlation functions. The comparison to ffiffi ffi s p \u00bc 200 GeV pp collisions at RHIC is complicated by the fact that these data are not available in multiplicity ranges. The multiplicity reach at RHIC corresponds to a combination of the first three multiplicity ranges in our study. No strong change is seen between the RHIC and LHC energies. It shows that the space-time characteristics of the soft particle production in pp collisions are only weakly dependent on collision energy in the range between 0.9 TeV to 7 TeV, if viewed in narrow multiplicity/k T ranges. Obviously the ffiffi ffi s p \u00bc 7 TeV data have a higher multiplicity reach, so the minimum-bias (multiplicity/k T integrated) correlation function for the two energies is different.",

R G out and R G side show an interesting behavior-at low multiplicity the k T dependence is flat for R G side and for R G out it rises at low k T and then falls again. For higher multiplicities both transverse radii develop a negative slope as multiplicity increases. At high multiplicity the slope is bigger for R G out , while R G side grows universally at all k T 's while developing a smaller negative slope. The difference in the evolution of shapes of R G out and R G side is best seen in their ratio, shown in panel (d) of Fig. 11. At low multiplicities the ratio is close to 1.0, then it decreases monotonically with multiplicity. We note that a negative slope in R G out and R G side was universally observed in all heavy-ion measurements at RHIC energies and sometimes also at lower energies. It is interpreted as a signature of the existence of strong space-momentum correlations in the emission process, which arise naturally if matter behaves collectively, like a fluid [5,33]. The observation of the development, with increasing multiplicity, of such slope in pp collisions is consistent with the hypothesis that the larger the produced multiplicity, the more space-momentum correlations are present. They could come from a selfinteracting and collective system or some other source; other measurements, e.g. inclusive transverse momentum spectra of identified particles as a function of multiplicity, are needed to draw conclusions about their nature. Nevertheless the possibility of the existence of strongly self-interacting collective system in high multiplicity pp collisions is exciting.",

In Fig. 13 we compare our results to heavy-ion results from collision energies above 15 AGeV. This is the first time that one can directly compare pp and heavy-ion radii at the same hdN ch =di, as we measure hdN ch =di comparable to the one in peripheral AuAu and CuCu collisions at RHIC. Since the value of the radius strongly depends on k T , we carefully selected the results to have the same average hk T i \u00bc 0:4 GeV=c. The picture at other k T 's is qualitatively similar. While both the heavy-ion and pp data scale linearly with hdN ch =di \u00f01=3\u00de , the slope of the dependence is clearly different, for all directions. This is illustrated by the K. AAMODT et al. PHYSICAL REVIEW D 84, 112004 (2011) dashed lines, which show linear fits, done separately to pp and (heavy-)ion data. The dotted lines show the range of dependencies allowed by the uncertainty of the fit. The pp results are systematically below the heavy-ion ones at similar multiplicity; therefore, the ''universal'' multiplicity scaling [5] observed in heavy-ion collisions does not hold for pp collisions at ffiffi ffi s p \u00bc 0:9 and 7 TeV. The pp radii do scale linearly with multiplicity but with a different slope. We also note that the linear scaling for (heavy-)ion data is only approximate, the 2 =N d:o:f: value for the fit presented here is significantly above unity, especially for R G out . We speculate that the difference comes from a different way that the two types of collisions arrive at similar multiplicity. To produce a large number of particles in pp collision one needs a particularly energetic elementary collision that produces a lot of soft particles. The region where they are created is on the order of the incoming proton size and the growth of the size with multiplicity comes from further reinteraction between particles after they are born. In contrast, in heavy-ion collision we have many elementary nucleon scatterings, each of them producing initially a relatively low multiplicity. These scatterings are distributed inside the overlap region of the two nuclei, and this initial distribution influences the final observed size. In this picture, one would expect the heavy-ion sizes to be larger than the ones observed in pp at the same multiplicity.",

The splitting occurs when one track is mistakenly reconstructed as two. Both tracks have then very close momenta. This results in a sharp correlation peak at low relative momentum. We have seen such effects in the data, and we took several steps to remove them. First, the requirement that the track is simultaneously reconstructed in the TPC and ITS decreases splitting significantly. In addition, each cluster in the TPC is flagged as ''shared'' if it is used in the reconstruction of more than one track. The split tracks tend to produce pairs which share most of their clusters; therefore, we removed pairs that share more than 5% of the TPC clusters. We also look for configurations where a single track is split in two segments in the TPC, e.g. by the TPC central membrane or a TPC sector boundary. Such segments should be correctly connected in the tracking procedure to form a single track if the detector calibration is perfect. However, in a few rare cases this does not happen and a split track can appear. Such pairs would consist of two tracks that have a relatively small number of TPC clusters and they would rarely both have a cluster in the same TPC padrow. Therefore, we count, for each pair, the number of times that both tracks have a separate (nonshared) cluster in a TPC padrow. Pairs for which this number is low are removed.

The fitting of the two representations, even though it uses the same mathematical formula (7), is different from the technical point of view. The SH procedure is more robust against holes in the acceptance [24], visible in our data, e.g. in Fig. 3. In an ideal case both procedures should produce identical fit results; therefore, we take the difference between the radii obtained from the two procedures as an estimate of the systematic uncertainty incurred by the fitting procedure itself. The error is shown in Table V as a function of k T . The large error at low k T is coming from the fact that the two procedures are sensitive to the holes in the acceptance in a different way. It reflects the experimental fact that, in these k T ranges, pairs in certain kinematic regions are not measured; therefore, the femtoscopic radius cannot be obtained with better accuracy. In the highest k T  D 84, 112004 (2011) range the mini-jet underlying correlation is highest and broadest. If our simple phenomenological parametrization of it does not perfectly describe its behavior in full threedimensional space, it can affect differently a fit in the Cartesian and SH representations. In summary, the combined systematic error is 10% for all k T and multiplicity ranges except the ones at the lower and upper edge. It is 20% for the lowest and highest k T and for the lowest and highest multiplicity range at each collision energy. It is also never smaller than 0.1 fm.",

Also, model studies [34] suggest that pion production at these energies has large contribution from strongly decaying resonances. This is confirmed by the observation of significant resonance peaks in the \u00fe \u00c0 correlation functions, seen e.g. in Fig. 8. Resonances decay after random time governed by the exponential decay law, which transforms into an exponential shape in space via the pair velocity. By definition pair velocity exists in the out and long direction and vanishes in side.

In order to select the proper combination of functional forms we seek guidance from models. They suggest that at least in the out and long direction the emission function is not Gaussian and in some cases seems to be well described by a Lorentzian. We performed a study of all 27 combinations of the fitting functions for selected multiplicity/k T ranges. We found that universally the out correlation function was best described by an exponential, corresponding to Lorentzian emission function, which agrees with model expectations. In contrast, the side direction is equally well described by a Gaussian or a Lorentzian; we chose the former because the Lorentzian correlation function would correspond to exponential pair emission function with a sharp peak at 0. We deem this unlikely, given that the models do not produce such shapes. In long, the correlation function is not Gaussian; hence, we chose the exponential shape in C for the fit.

The quality of the fit (judged by the value of 2 =N dof ) is better than for the three-dimensional Gaussian fit. The parameter is higher by up to 0.2, as compared to the pure Gaussian fit, reflecting the fact that the new functional form accounts for the pairs contributing to the narrow correlation peak at small q. The resulting exponential radii cannot be directly compared in magnitude to the Gaussian radii from other experiments. However all the features seen in dependencies of the Gaussian radii on multiplicity and k T are also visible here. This confirms that with a functional form that fits our correlation function well (better than a threedimensional Gaussian) the physics message from the dependence of radii on multiplicity and k T remains valid. The study of the fit functional form shows that the correlation does not have a Gaussian shape in out and long. The R G side from this fit should be equal to the R G side from the three-dimensional Gaussian fit with two caveats. The first is the assumption that the emission function fully factorizes into separate functions for out, side, and long directions. In the fitting of the three-dimensional correlation functions the residual correlation between the value of the parameter and the values of the radii is often   (10)] as a function of pair momentum k T for all multiplicity ranges and for two collision energies.

We noted already that the non-Gaussian fit produces larger values of , so R G side could be affected. Nevertheless we observe very good agreement (within statistical errors for multiplicities above 16) between the R G side values from both fits, giving us additional confidence that the underlying assumptions in our fit are valid.",

The longitudinal size shows expected behavior. It decreases with pair momentum and increases with event multiplicity, consistent with all previous measurements in elementary and heavy-ion collisions. The transverse sizes show more complicated behavior. The sideward radius grows with multiplicity FIG. 17 (color online). One-dimensional R inv radius for all multiplicity and k T ranges for the ffiffi ffi s p \u00bc 0:9 TeV data. The points for different multiplicities were slightly shifted in k T for clarity.

D 84, 112004 (2011) and has a negative correlation with pair momentum. The outward radius at the lowest multiplicity is small for the lowest k T , increases for larger k T , and then decreases. As the multiplicity grows the shape of the k T dependence gradually changes to one monotonically falling with k T . The resulting ratio of outward to sideward radii gets smaller as multiplicity grows. Similar dependencies in heavy-ion collisions were interpreted as signatures of the collective behavior of matter. One possible interpretation of the results in this work is that as one moves towards pp collisions producing high multiplicity of particles, similar collectivity develops. More experimental and theoretical information is needed to address this intriguing possibility. The upper range of multiplicities produced in pp collisions at ffiffi ffi s p \u00bc 7 TeV is comparable to the multiplicities measured in peripheral heavy-ion collisions at RHIC. When plotted versus hdN ch =di \u00f01=3\u00de the radii in pp show linear scaling but with different slope and offset than those observed in heavy-ion collisions. Therefore our observations violate the universal hdN ch =di \u00f01=3\u00de scaling. This proves that the final observed particle multiplicity is not the only scaling variable in the system and the initial geometry must be taken into account in any scaling arguments.",

We assume these are the mini-jet structures which are visible at values of p t as low as 0:5 GeV=c. The Monte-Carlo studies are consistent with such a hypothesis and are used to parametrize and take into account the influence of mini-jets on the fitted femtoscopic radii. Studies of the \u00fe \u00c0 correlations are also consistent with such hypothesis. Nevertheless, the need to account for this effect remains the main source of the systematic error.",
