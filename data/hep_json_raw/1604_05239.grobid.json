            "text": "A search for narrow resonances decaying to an electron and a muon is presented. The e\u03bc mass spectrum is also investigated for non-resonant contributions from the production of quantum black holes (QBHs). The analysis is performed using data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb \u22121 collected in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV with the CMS detector at the LHC. With no evidence for physics beyond the standard model in the invariant mass spectrum of selected e\u03bc pairs, upper limits are set at 95 % confidence level on the product of cross section and branching fraction for signals arising in theories with charged lepton flavour violation. In the search for narrow resonances, the resonant production of a \u03c4 sneutrino in R-parity violating supersymmetry is considered. The \u03c4 sneutrino is excluded for masses below 1.28 TeV for couplings \u03bb 132 = \u03bb 231 = \u03bb 311 = 0.01, and below 2.30 TeV for \u03bb 132 = \u03bb 231 = 0.07 and \u03bb 311 = 0.11. These are the most stringent limits to date from direct searches at high-energy colliders. In addition, the resonance searches are interpreted in terms of a model with heavy partners of the Z boson and the photon. In a framework of TeV-scale quantum gravity based on a renormalization of Newton's constant, the search for non-resonant contributions to the e\u03bc mass spectrum excludes QBH production below a threshold mass M th of 1.99 TeV. In models that invoke extra dimensions, the bounds range from 2.36 TeV for one extra dimension to 3.63 TeV for six extra dimensions. This is the first search for QBHs decaying into the e\u03bc final state.",

This paper reports a search for phenomena beyond the SM in the invariant mass spectrum of e\u03bc pairs. The analysis is based on data with an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb \u22121 collected in proton-proton (pp) collisions at \u221a s = 8 TeV with the CMS detector at the CERN LHC [1]. The results are interpreted in terms of three theoretically predicted objects: a \u03c4 sneutrino (\u03bd \u03c4 ) lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) in R-parity violating (RPV) supersymmetry (SUSY) [2], interfering LFV Z and \u03b3 bosons [3], and quantum black holes (QBHs) [4][5][6].",

Flavour changing processes are introduced through the Kaluza-Klein modes of gauge fields that are not localised on a brane. In four-dimensional space-time, an effective Lagrangian can be obtained that contains two complex vector fields Z and \u03b3 . These vector fields generate transitions between the families in which the generation number changes by unity, such as the process d + s \u2192 Z /\u03b3 \u2192 e \u2212 + \u03bc + and its charge conjugate. The structure of the terms in the Lagrangian for the production and decay of the Z and \u03b3 bosons is analogous to that describing the interactions of the Z boson and the photon with quarks and charged leptons, respectively. The coupling strengths g 12 and e 12 are related to their SM counterparts through a multiplicative coupling modifier \u03ba. For simplicity, the masses M Z and M \u03b3 are assumed to be equal, and the model is referred to as the LFV Z model. It is characterized by the two independent parameters M Z and \u03ba.",

            "text": "Theories that have a fundamental Planck scale of the order of a TeV [9][10][11][12][13] offer the possibility of producing microscopic black holes [14][15][16] at the LHC. In contrast to semiclassical, thermal black holes, which would decay to high-multiplicity final states, QBHs are non-thermal objects expected to decay predominantly to pairs of particles. We consider the production of a spin-0, colourless, neutral QBH in a model with lepton flavour violation, in which the cross section for QBH production is extrapolated from semiclassical black holes and depends on the threshold mass M th for QBH production and the number of extra dimensions n. For n = 0, it corresponds to a 3+1-dimensional model with low-scale quantum gravity, where a renormalization of Newton's constant leads to a Planck scale at the TeV scale [13,17,18]; n = 1 corresponds to the Randall-Sundrum (RS) brane world model [9,10]; and n > 1 to the Arkani-Hamed-Dimopoulos-Dvali (ADD) model [11,12]. We consider flat-space black holes (black holes that are spherical both in the brane and in the bulk dimensions) and, in the case of RS-type black holes (n = 1), consider only the regime in which almost flat five-dimensional space is an applicable metric. This is the case for r S 1/(ke \u2212kr c ), where r S is the Schwarzschild radius, k denotes the Anti-de Sitter curvature, and r c is the size of the extra dimension. The threshold M th is assumed to be at the Planck scale in the definition of the Particle Data Group [19] for n = 0 and n > 1, whereas for n = 1 both the PDG and RS definitions [4] are adopted. In this model, the branching fraction of QBH decays to the e \u00b1 \u03bc \u2213 final state is 1.1 %, which is twice that of the dimuon or dielectron decay modes, making the e \u00b1 \u03bc \u2213 signature the most promising leptonic decay channel. While the resonant \u03bd \u03c4 and LFV Z signals result in a narrow peak in the invariant mass spectrum of the e\u03bc pair, the mass distribution of the QBH signal is characterized by an edge at the threshold for QBH production, and a monotonically decreasing tail.",

Within the solenoid volume are a silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL), and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter (HCAL), each composed of a barrel and two endcap sections. Extensive forward calorimetry complements the coverage provided by the barrel and endcap detectors. Muons are measured in gas-ionization detectors embedded in the steel flux-return yoke outside the solenoid. The silicon tracker consists of 1440 silicon pixel and 15 148 silicon strip detector modules and measures charged particles within the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 2.5. The ECAL consists of 75 848 lead tungstate crystals and provides coverage for |\u03b7| < 1.479 in a barrel region and 1.479 < |\u03b7| < 3.0 in two endcap regions. Muons are measured in the range |\u03b7| < 2.4, with detection planes using three technologies: drift tubes, cathode strip chambers, and resistive plate chambers. A two-level trigger system is used by the CMS experiment. The first level is composed of custom hardware processors and uses information from the calorimeters and muon detectors to select interesting events and to reduce the event rate from the initial bunch crossing frequency of 20 MHz to a maximum of 100 kHz. The high-level trigger processor farm further decreases the event rate to 400 Hz before data storage. A detailed description of the CMS detector, together with a definition of the coordinate system used and the relevant kinematic variables, can be found in Ref. [35].",

The transverse energy is defined as the magnitude of the projection on the plane perpendicular to the beam of the electron momentum vector normalized to the electron energy measured in the ECAL.

In addition, the sum of the E T of calorimeter energy deposits in the same cone that are not associated with the electron candidate must be less than 3 % of the candidate's E T (plus a small \u03b7-dependent offset). To minimise the impact of additional pp interactions in the same bunch crossing (pileup) on the selection efficiency, the calorimeter isolation is corrected for the average energy density in the event [41]. Further reduction of electron misidentification is achieved by requiring the transverse profile of the energy deposition in the ECAL to be consistent with the expected electron profile, and the sum of HCAL energy deposits in a cone of size 0.15 in \u0394R to be less than 5 % of the electron's ECAL energy.

Using dielectron events from Z boson decays [37], the total efficiency to reconstruct and select electrons with p e T > 100 GeV is found to be 88 \u00b1 2 % (syst) in the barrel region and 84 \u00b1 4 % (syst) in the endcaps.

A more detailed description of the implemented QBH model including the dependence of the M e\u03bc spectrum from QBH decays on the model parameters is presented in Ref. [45]. The LFV Z signal events are produced with the MadGraph (v. 5.1.5.9) generator [46]. The effects of the interference resulting from the M Z = M \u03b3 mass degeneracy on the cross section and signal acceptance are taken into account, and the coupling parameters of the model are taken to be the same as in Ref. [3]. All signal samples use the CTEQ6L1 [44] PDF, pythia (v. 6.426) [47] for hadronization with the underlying event tune Z2*, and are processed through a simulation of the full CMS detector based on Geant4 (v. 9.4) [48]. The pythia Z2* tune is derived from the Z1 tune [49], which uses the CTEQ5L PDF set, whereas Z2* adopts CTEQ6L.  Table 1 Signal acceptance (A) and the product of acceptance and efficiency (A ) for different signal masses, for the RPV\u03bd \u03c4 and LFV Z models. The acceptance is defined as the fraction of signal events in the simulation passing the selection on lepton p T and \u03b7 applied to the generated leptons The total acceptance times efficiency for each of the three signal models considered in this analysis is determined using MC simulation with selection efficiencies corrected to the values measured in data. The signal acceptance, as defined by the selection on the lepton p T and \u03b7 applied to the generated leptons in the signal simulation, and the product of acceptance and selection efficiency, are shown in Tables 1  and 2, evaluated for selected signal masses. The acceptance of the RPV\u03bd \u03c4 model is that of a generic spin-0 resonance. In the case of the LFV Z model, the acceptance is more modelspecific due to the interference between the Z and the \u03b3 . This interference shapes the \u03b7 distributions of the leptons in the final state, which leads to a smaller acceptance compared to a generic spin-1 resonance. Table 3 lists the parameterizations of the acceptance times efficiency as a function of signal mass for the RPV\u03bd \u03c4 and LFV Z resonance signals, resulting from fits in the mass range from 200 GeV to 2.5 TeV. These parameterizations are used later in the statistical interpretation of the resonance search.

            "section": "Background estimation",
            "text": "The SM backgrounds contributing to the e\u03bc final state can be divided into two classes of events. The first class comprises events with at least two prompt, isolated leptons. The second class consists of events with either jets or photons that are misidentified as isolated leptons, and events with jets containing non-prompt leptons. This second class of background is referred to as \"non-prompt background\" in this paper. The expected SM background from processes with two prompt leptons is obtained from MC simulations. It consists mostly of events from tt production and WW production; the former process is dominant at lower masses and the latter becomes equally important above M e\u03bc \u223c 1 TeV. Other background processes estimated from MC simulation are the additional diboson processes WZ and ZZ, single top tW production, and Drell-Yan (DY) \u03c4 \u03c4 events with subsequent decay of the \u03c4 \u03c4 pair into an electron and a muon. The tt, tW, and WW simulated samples are generated using powheg (v. 1.0) [50][51][52] with the CT10 PDF [53], and the DY, WZ, and ZZ background samples are generated using the Mad-Graph (v. 5.1.3.30) event generator with the CTEQ6L1 PDF. All background samples use pythia (v. 6.426) for hadronization with the underlying event tune Z2 * . The generated events are processed through a full simulation of the CMS detector based on Geant4 (v. 9.4). Pileup interactions are included in the simulation and event-dependent weights are applied in order to reproduce the number of pp interactions expected for the measured instantaneous luminosity. After this procedure, the distribution of the number of vertices per event observed in data is well described by the simulation. The simulated samples are normalized to the integrated luminosity of the data sample, 19.7 fb \u22121 . The cross sections are calculated to next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) accuracy in perturbative QCD for tt [54] and DY [55] and to NLO accuracy for the tW [56], WW, WZ, and ZZ [57] processes. The main sources of non-prompt background in the e\u03bc selection arise from W+jet and W\u03b3 production with a jet or photon that are misidentified as an electron. The Z+jet, QCD multijet, and tt processes yield subleading contributions to the background with non-prompt leptons. The W\u03b3 background is estimated from simulation based on the Mad-Graph (v. 5.1.3.30) event generator. A background estimation based on control samples in data, using the jet-to-electron misidentification rate (MR) method explained below, is used to determine the M e\u03bc distributions from W+jet and QCD multijet production. The measurement of the jet-to-electron misidentification rate has been carried out in the context of Ref. [40]. It starts from a sample collected using a prescaled single electromagnetic cluster trigger, in which the presence of an electron candidate with relaxed electron identification criteria is required. The events of the sample must have no more than one reconstructed electron with E T > 10 GeV, in order to suppress the contribution from Z decays. The misidentification measurement can be biased by selecting genuine electrons from W+jet events or converted photons from \u03b3 +jet events. Processes that can give a single electron, such as tt, tW, WW, WZ, Z \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 , and Z \u2192 ee where, if a second electron is produced, it fails to be reconstructed, give another less significant source of contamination. Simulated samples are used to correct for this contamination and its effect on the MR. After these corrections, the electron MR, measured in bins of E T and \u03b7, is the number of electrons passing the full selection over the number of electron candidates in the sample.",

            "text": "After the event selection, 28 925 events are observed in data. The e\u03bc invariant mass distribution is shown in Fig. 2, together with the corresponding cumulative distribution. A comparison of the observed and expected event yields is given in Table 4. The dominant background process is tt, which contributes 69 % of the total background yield after selection, followed by WW production, contributing 11 %. The two selected leptons carry opposite measured electric charge in 26 840 events and carry the same charge in 2085 events. According to the background estimation, 2100 \u00b1 360 events with same-charge e\u03bc pairs are expected, most of which stem from the W+jet process, followed by tt and diboson production WZ/ZZ. The systematic uncertainties assigned to backgrounds obtained from simulation include the integrated luminosity (2.6 %) [58] and the acceptance times efficiency (5 %). The latter is based on the uncertainties in the various efficiency scale factors that correct the simulation to the efficiencies measured in data. According to simulation, the evolution of the lepton selection efficiencies from the Z pole, where they are measured, to high lepton p T is covered within this uncertainty. The uncertainty in the muon momentum scale is 5 % per TeV. Electron energy scale uncertainties are 0.6 % in the barrel and 1.5 % in the endcap. These momentum and energy scale uncertainties cumulatively lead to an uncertainty in the total background yield of 2 % at M e\u03bc = 500 GeV and 3.5 % at M e\u03bc = 1 TeV. Uncertainties in the electron E T and muon p T resolutions have a negligible impact on the total background yield. The uncertainty associated with the choice of PDF in the background simulation is evaluated according to the PDF4LHC prescription [59,60] and translates into an uncertainty in the background yield ranging from 5 % at M e\u03bc = 200 GeV to 9 % at M e\u03bc = 1 TeV. Among the uncertainties in the cross sections used for the normalization of the various simulated background samples, the 5 % uncertainty in the NNLO QCD cross section of the dominant tt background [54] is the most relevant. Further uncertainties associated with the modelling of the shape of the e\u03bc invariant mass distribution are taken into account for the two leading backgrounds: tt (higher-order corrections on the topp T description discussed in [61]) and WW (scale uncertainties studied with the powheg generator). These lead to an uncertainty in the total background yield of up to 13 % at M e\u03bc = 1 TeV. A further systematic uncertainty arises from the limited sizes of the simulated background samples at high invariant mass, where the background expectation is small. Taking all systematic uncertainties into account, the resulting uncertainty in the background yield ranges from 9 % at M e\u03bc = 200 GeV to 18 % at M e\u03bc = 1 TeV.",

Two types of signal shapes are considered for the limit setting: a narrow resonance and the broader e\u03bc invariant mass spectrum from QBH decays. The RPV\u03bd \u03c4 and Z signals both result in a narrow resonance. For coupling values not excluded by existing searches, the intrinsic widths of these signals are small compared to the detector resolution. Therefore, Gaussian functions are used to model the signal shapes. For each probed resonance signal mass, the two parameters, acceptance times efficiency (Table 3) and invariant mass resolution, define the signal shape used for limit setting. The invariant mass resolution is derived from fits of Gaussian distributions to the e\u03bc invariant mass spectra from MC simulated signal samples and ranges from 1.6 % at a resonance mass of M res = 200 GeV to 6 % at M res = 3 TeV. For high values of e\u03bc pair invariant mass, it is dominated by the res-olution on the measurement of the muon p T , which ranges from about 2 % at p T = 200 GeV to 6 % at p T = 500 GeV and 10 % at p T = 1 TeV. These values are obtained from MC simulations and agree within the uncertainties with measurements using cosmic ray muons. This model of the narrow resonance allows for a scan of the invariant mass spectrum with a fine spacing of the signal mass hypothesis that corresponds to the invariant mass resolution.",
