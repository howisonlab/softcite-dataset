            "text": "The cross section for the process e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8 is measured precisely at center-of-mass energies from 3.77 to 4.60 GeV using 9 fb \u22121 of data collected with the BESIII detector operating at the BEPCII storage ring. Two resonant structures are observed in a fit to the cross section. The first resonance has a mass of (4222.0 \u00b1 3.1 \u00b1 1.4) MeV/c 2 and a width of (44.1 \u00b1 4.3 \u00b1 2.0) MeV, while the second one has a mass of (4320.0 \u00b1 10.4 \u00b1 7.0) MeV/c 2 and a width of (101.4 +25.3 \u221219.7 \u00b1 10.2) MeV, where the first errors are statistical and second ones are systematic. The first resonance agrees with the Y (4260) resonance reported by previous experiments. The precision of its resonant parameters is improved significantly. The second resonance is observed in e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8 for the first time. The statistical significance of this resonance is estimated to be larger than 7.6\u03c3. The mass and width of the second resonance agree with the Y (4360) resonance reported by the BABAR and Belle experiments within errors. Finally, the Y (4008) resonance previously observed by the Belle experiment is not confirmed in the description of the BESIII data. The process e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8 at center-of-mass (c.m.) energies between 3.8 and 5.0 GeV was first studied by the BABAR experiment using an initial-state-radiation (ISR) technique [1], and a new structure, the Y (4260), was reported with a mass around 4.26 GeV/c 2 . This observation was immediately confirmed by the CLEO [2] and Belle experiments [3] in the same process. In addition, the Belle experiment reported an accumulation of events at around 4 GeV, which was called Y (4008) later. Although the Y (4008) state is still controversial -a new measurement by the BABAR experiment does not confirm it [4], while an updated measurement by the Belle experiment still supports its existence [5] -the observation of the Y -states has stimulated substantial theoretical discussions on their nature [6,7].",

Furthermore, the observation of the states Y (4360) and Y (4660) in e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c8(2S) [10], together with the newly observed resonant structures in e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c9\u03c7 c0 [11] and e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 h c [12], overpopulate the vector charmonium spectrum predicted by potential models [13]. All of this indicates that the Y states may not be conventional charmonium states, and they are good candidates for new types of exotic particles, such as hybrids, tetraquarks, or meson molecules [6,7].",

The J/\u03c8 candidate is reconstructed with its leptonic decay modes (\u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 and e + e \u2212 ). The data sample used in this measurement includes two independent data sets. A high luminosity data set (dubbed \"XYZ data\") contains more than 40 pb \u22121 at each c.m. energy with a total integrated luminosity of 8.2 fb \u22121 , which domi-nates the precision of this measurement; and a low luminosity data set (dubbed \"Scan data\") contains about 7-9 pb \u22121 at each c.m. energy with a total integrated luminosity of 0.8 fb \u22121 . The integrated luminosities are measured with Bhabha events with an uncertainty of 1% [24]. The c.m. energy of each data set is measured using dimuon events, with an uncertainty of \u00b10.8 MeV [26]. The BESIII detector is described in detail elsewhere [25]. The GEANT4-based [27] Monte Carlo (MC) simulation software package BOOST [28], which includes the geometric description of the BESIII detector and the detector response, is used to optimize event selection criteria, determine the detection efficiency, and estimate the backgrounds. For the signal process, we generate 60,000 e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8 events at each c.m. energy of the \"XYZ data\", and an extrapolation is performed to the \"Scan data\" with nearby c.m. energies. At e + e \u2212 c.m. energies between 4.189 and 4.358 GeV, the signal events are generated according to the Dalitz plot distributions obtained from the data set at corresponding c.m. energy, since there is significant Z c (3900) production [5,21,22]. At other c.m. energies, signal events are generated using an EVTGEN [29] phase space model. The J/\u03c8 decays into \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 and e + e \u2212 with same branching fractions [8]. The ISR is simulated with KKMC [30], and the maximum ISR photon energy is set to correspond to a 3.72 GeV/c 2 production threshold of the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8 system. Final-state-radiation (FSR) is simulated with PHO-TOS [31]. Possible background contributions are estimated with KKMC-generated inclusive MC samples [e + e \u2212 \u2192 e + e \u2212 , \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 , \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 , \u03b3\u03b3, \u03b3 ISR J/\u03c8, \u03b3 ISR \u03c8(2S), and qq with q = u, d, s, c] with comparable integrated luminosities to the \"XYZ data\".",

The fit has four solutions with equally good fit quality [34] and identical masses and widths of the resonances (listed in Table I), while the phases and the product of the electronic widths with the branching fractions are different (listed in Table II). Figure 1 shows the fit results. The resonance R 1 has a mass and width consistent with that of Y (4008) observed by Belle [5] within 1.0\u03c3 and 2.9\u03c3, respectively. The resonance R 2 has a mass 4222.0 \u00b1 3.1 MeV/c 2 , which agrees with the average mass, 4251 \u00b1 9 MeV/c 2 [8], of the Y (4260) peak [1][2][3][4][5] within 3.0\u03c3.

Thus, the existence of a resonance near 4 GeV, such as the resonance R 1 or the Y (4008) resonance [3], is not necessary to explain the data. The fit has four solutions with equally good fit quality [34] and identical masses and widths of the resonances (listed in Table I), while the phases and the product of the electronic widths with the branching fractions are different (listed in Table II).

For the MC simulation of signal events, we use both the \u03c0 \u00b1 Z c (3900) \u2213 model [5,21,22] and the phase space model to describe the e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8 process. The efficiency difference between these two models is 3.1%, which is taken as systematic uncertainty due to the decay model. The efficiency for the other selection criteria, the trigger simulation, the event start time determination and the FSR simulation are quite high (> 99%), and their systematic errors are estimated to be less than 1%. In the ISR correction procedure, we iterate the cross section measurement until (1 + \u03b4)\u01eb converges. The convergence criterion is taken as the systematic uncertainty due to the ISR correction, which is 1%. We obtain the number of signal events by either fitting or counting events in the M (\u2113 + \u2113 \u2212 ) distribution. The background shape is described by a linear distribution. Varying the background shape from a linear shape to a second-order polynomial causes a 1.6% (2.1%) difference for the J/\u03c8 signal yield for the \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 (e + e \u2212 ) mode, which is taken as the systematic uncertainty for background shape. The branching fraction of J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u2113 + \u2113 \u2212 is taken from PDG [8], the errors are 0.6% for both J/\u03c8 decay modes. Assuming all the sources of systematic uncertainty to be independent, the total systematic uncertainties are obtained by adding them in quadrature, resulting in 5.7% for the \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 mode, and 5.9% for the e + e \u2212  ",

The largest deviation of the resonant parameters between the fits with and without interference for the \u03c8(3770) amplitude are taken as systematic error, which is 0.3 (1.3) MeV/c 2 for the mass, and 2.0 (9.7) MeV for the width of the R 2 (R 3 ) resonance.

The first resonance agrees with the Y (4260) resonance reported by BABAR, CLEO and Belle [1][2][3][4][5]. However, our measured width is much narrower than the Y (4260) average width [8] reported by previous experiments. This is thanks to the much more precise data from BESIII, which results in the observation of the second resonance. The second resonance is observed for the first time in the process e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8. Its statistical significance is estimated to be larger than 7.6\u03c3.
