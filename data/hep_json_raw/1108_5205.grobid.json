Top quarks are mainly produced in pairs via the strong interaction, with a cross section of \u03c3 tt = 7.3 +0.5 \u22120.6 pb [2] in pp collisions at \u221a s = 1.96 TeV. In the framework of the Standard Model (SM), top quarks decay almost exclusively into W bosons and b quarks. Consequently, top quark pair events contain a b and ab quark from the tt decay, and the remaining final state to be observed depends on the decay mode of the two W bosons.",

The expected fractions of the three possible helicity states of the W boson are: longitudinal fraction f 0 \u2248 69%, left-handed fraction f \u2212 \u2248 31% and right-handed fraction f + \u2248 10 \u22123 [3]. The W boson helicity is reflected in the angular distribution cos \u03b8 * of its decay products, with \u03b8 * being the angle of the down-type decay products of the W boson (charged lepton, d-or s-quark) in the W boson rest frame relative to the top quark direction. Any observation of f + at the percent level would signal new physics beyond the SM. D0 measures the W boson helicity using a dataset corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 5.4 fb \u22121 , using both lepton + jets and dilepton final states of tt decays [4]. Since the measurement is still expected to be limited by sample statistics, the event selection in each channel is optimised for tt acceptance, using multivariate likelihood discriminants based on event topology and object kinematics. In the lepton + jets channel, the event kinematics is obtained from the best kinematic fit to the tt event hypothesis, which enables the calculation of cos \u03b8 * for the leptonic W boson decay. The hadronic W boson decay is utilised as well to evaluate | cos \u03b8 * |, which does not permit discrimination between rightand left-handed W bosons, but still adds information to further constrain f 0 . In the dilepton events, m t = 172.5 GeV is assumed and cos \u03b8 * is obtained for each top quark as the average over all possible solutions of the event kinematics, taking lepton and jet energy resolutions into account by varying the energies within their uncertainties.",
