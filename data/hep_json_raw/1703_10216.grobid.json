            "text": "We report branching fraction measurements of the decays B + \u2192 \u03b7 + \u03bd and B + \u2192 \u03b7 + \u03bd based on 711 fb \u22121 of data collected near the \u03a5(4S) resonance with the Belle experiment at the KEKB asymmetric-energy e + e \u2212 collider. This data sample contains 772 million BB events. One of the two B mesons is fully reconstructed in a hadronic decay mode. Among the remaining (\"signal-B\") daughters, we search for the \u03b7 meson in two decay channels, \u03b7 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 and \u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 , and reconstruct the \u03b7 meson in \u03b7 \u2192 \u03b7\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 with subsequent decay of the \u03b7 into \u03b3\u03b3. Combining the two \u03b7 modes and using an extended maximum likelihood, the B + \u2192 \u03b7 + \u03bd branching fraction is measured to be (4.2 \u00b1 1.1(stat.) \u00b1 0.3(syst.)) \u00d7 10 \u22125 . For B + \u2192 \u03b7 + \u03bd , we observe no significant signal and set an upper limit of 0.72 \u00d7 10 \u22124 at 90% confidence level. The magnitude of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix element |V ub | [1,2] can be determined by inclusive measurements sensitive to the entire b \u2192 u \u03bd rate in a given region of phase space, or by exclusive mea-surements of specific b \u2192 u decays such as B \u2192 \u03c0 \u03bd . As both experimental and theoretical uncertainties differ in the two approaches, consistency between the inclusive and exclusive determinations of |V ub | is a crucial cross-check of our understanding of the CKM mechanism. At present, inclusive and exclusive measurements of |V ub | disagree by about three standard deviations [3]. Precise measurements of B \u2192 \u03b7 \u03bd and B \u2192 \u03b7 \u03bd rates will improve the inclusive signal modelling, since the lack of knowledge on all exclusive b \u2192 u \u03bd decays is one of the contributions to the systematic uncertainty [4]. Also, a measurement of the ratio B(B \u2192 \u03b7 \u03bd )/B(B \u2192 \u03b7 \u03bd ) determines the \u03b7 \u2212 \u03b7 mixing angle and the F B\u2192\u03b7 ( ) + form factor [5,6] by constraining the gluonic singlet contribution to this form factor in the LCSR calculation [4]. In this paper, we report measurements of the branching fractions B(B + \u2192 \u03b7 + \u03bd ) and B(B + \u2192 \u03b7 + \u03bd ) [7], where stands for either an electron or a muon. These are the first measurements of these decays based on the Belle data sample. The modes have been studied previously by CLEO [8,9] and BaBar [10][11][12][13].",

We reconstruct \u03b7 candidates in the \u03b7 \u2192 \u03b7\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 channel with \u03b7 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 and require 0.926 GeV < M \u03b7\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 < 0.986 GeV. The aforementioned mass requirements correspond to 3\u03c3 windows around the nominal mass of the mesons. The fraction of events with multiple meson candidates after the signal selection corresponds to 17.5% for \u03b7 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3, 7.4% for \u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 and 36% for \u03b7 \u2192 \u03b7(\u03b3\u03b3)\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 . If more than one \u03b7 ( ) candidate is found on the signal side, we select the one closer to the nominal \u03b7 ( ) mass [27]. For modes involving charged pions, we also use information on the signal vertex quality, and choose the candidate with the smallest \u03c7 2 tot defined as \u03c7 2 mass + \u03c7 2 vertex . After selecting the single charged lepton and the \u03b7 ( ) candidate, the remaining particles on the signal side are considered further to reduce background. We require no remaining charged particles. The sum of the energies of neutral clusters associated with neither B tag nor B sig must be below 0.5 GeV. To reject charged leptons inconsistent with the signal decay, the charge of the lepton must be opposite to that of the B tag meson. Since the \u03b7 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 mode has a larger background than the \u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 mode, we remove any events in the former channel that contain one or more neutral pions on the signal side. This \u03c0 0 veto is not applied to the \u03b7 \u2192 \u03b7(\u03b3\u03b3)\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 channel.",

For well-reconstructed signal decays, we expect M 2 miss to peak at zero, as the only remaining particle in the event is the neutrino. We determine the yields of the signal, b \u2192 u \u03bd , b \u2192 c \u03bd and continuum backgrounds from an extended binned maximum likelihood fit to the M 2 miss distribution between \u22121.6 and 5.0 GeV 2 (with a bin width of 0.2 GeV 2 ). The shapes of the fit components are taken from MC simulation and the fitting algorithm accounts for statistical fluctuations in both the real data and the MC simulated samples [28]. As continuum is a small component, we fix it to the MC expected yield. The contributions from secondary and fake leptons are negligible and thus not taken into account as additional fit components. For B + \u2192 \u03b7 \u03bd , the fit incorporates both \u03b7 modes. As a cross-check, we also determine the fit results for the individual \u03b7 modes. In addition, we include also fit results for the regions of q 2 = (p + p \u03bd ) 2 below and above 12 GeV 2 . These fit results are quoted in Table I and shown in Fig. 1. We carried out 10000 toy MC to validate the fit procedure. The distributions of signal and background in each ensemble are generated according to their measured values in data, and then the fit procedure is executed. The statistical uncertainties estimated by the nominal fit are consistent with the size of the uncertainties evaluated by the toy MC technique. However, given that in some channels the pull distribution exhibits a non-Gaussian shape, we do not apply a correction to the central value of the signal yields. Instead, we assign a systematic uncertainty associated with the fit procedure with values between 2% and 10% depending on the reconstructed channel.",

The branching fractions of B \u2192 (D ( * ) , \u03c0, \u03c1, \u03c9) \u03bd have been corrected [27]. The hadronic branching fractions on the tag side are adjusted by the B tag calibration and its uncertainty is taken from Ref. [30]. We vary the branching fractions of the b \u2192 u \u03bd and b \u2192 c \u03bd decay modes within \u00b11 standard deviation of their world average values.

The systematic error components in which a weight factor is applied include uncertainties due to secondary and fake leptons and the continuum. The contribution of the secondary leptons is adjusted to the measured b \u2192 c \u2192 branching fraction.

Since the expected number of continuum events is small after signal selection, a comparison with off-resonance data is not carried out. Instead, we rely on MC simulation to estimate the systematic uncertainty associated with continuum normalization by varying the number of events by 20% and examining the effect on the fit.

For the branching fraction of B + \u2192 \u03b7 + \u03bd , we determine a 90% confidence level upper limit of 0.72\u00d710 \u22124 . The measurements are compatible with previous analyses performed by CLEO and BaBar [8][9][10][11][12][13]. Our measurement is limited by the size of the Belle data sample. Significant improvements can thus be expected from the Belle II/SuperKEKB super flavor factory.",
