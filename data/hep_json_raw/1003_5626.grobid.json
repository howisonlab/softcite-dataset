Cuts, notably on scintillation pulse shape and scintillation-to-ionisation ratio, give a net exposure of 63 kg day in the range 20-80 keV nuclear recoil energy, in which 6 events are observed. Upper limits on signal rate are derived from the maximum empty patch in the data. Under standard halo assumptions a small region of parameter space consistent, at 99% CL, with causing the 1.17 ton yr DAMA modulation signal is allowed at 90% CL: it is in the mass range 45-60 GeV c \u22122 with a minimum CL of 87%, again derived from the maximum patch. This is the tightest constraint yet presented using xenon, a target nucleus whose similarity to iodine mitigiates systematic error from the assumed halo.",

However, systematic uncertainty in the expected relative rates in different targets due to nuclear form factors and WIMP velocity distributions grows with the difference in atomic mass [6]. On balance, xenon is well suited to test iDM models that would, by predicting a modulated rate of scattering against iodine nuclei, explain the DAMA observation. ZEPLIN-III (described in detail in Refs. [7,8]) is a liquid/gas detector designed to search for WIMPs scattering against xenon nuclei in the 6.5 kg fiducial liquid volume. It is built of lowradionuclide components, encased in hydrocarbon and lead shielding, and operated in the Palmer Laboratory at Boulby Mine beneath 2850 m water-equivalent rock overburden. signal from the liquid is denoted by S1. A 3.9 kVcm \u22121 electric field in the liquid extracts ionisation charge from the interaction site, drifts it to the surface and forces emission into the gas layer above; there, an electroluminescence signal, S2, is produced. As described in Ref. [4], events with one S1 and one S2 signal were selected and cuts made, based on the pattern of light distribution, to remove multiple-scintillation, single-ionisation events.",

Discrimination between nuclear and electron recoil events is achieved primarily through the ratio of scintillation and ionisation signal size. Additional discrimination has been achieved here using scintillation pulse shape. Recoiling electrons and nuclei produce different proportions of the singlet and triplet excited dimer states, which have lifetimes of 4 and 22 ns respectively [9]. PMT traces in ZEPLIN-III are sampled at 2 ns intervals. The mean arrival time of the S1 photons, denoted by \u03c4 1 , can therefore be used to discriminate between electron and nuclear recoils; Fig. 1 shows the separation of the two types of calibration data in an example energy bin. The timing of neutron calibration events within each 5-keVee bin from 5 to 40 keVee is well described by gamma distributions in 1/\u03c4 1 [10]. Fitting a polynomial in E ee to the medians of the gamma distributions produces a cut on \u03c4 1 with 50% signal acceptance. The power of this cut to reduce electron recoil background increases with energy, as seen in Fig. 2, mainly due to a narrowing in the \u03c4 1 distribution of electron recoil events.",

[4], the log 10 (S2/S1) distribution was fitted by a Gaussian in each energy bin, and the energy dependence of the fitted means and standard deviations parametrised by a power law to define a cut with 47.7% signal acceptance. Charge recombination causes S2 and S1 to be microscopically anticorrelated at a given energy; in principle, therefore, the S2/S1 distribution at fixed S1 could depend on the recoil energy spectrum. However, the low level of field-induced S1 suppression observed for nuclear recoils in xenon [11] suggests that the effect is small. Here we have assumed, as xenon experiments historically have, that the S2/S1 distribution of neutron calibration events is an adequate approximation to that of signal events with the same S1. After efficiencies from dead time, pulse-finding, event reconstruction and the cuts on S2/S1 and \u03c4 1 , the net exposure for signal events is 63 kg day, with 5% uncertainty due to neutron calibration statistics.",

Non-Maxwellian velocity distributions would cause a similar systematic effect. Fig. 5 shows the ZEPLIN-III constraints on parameter space consistent with causing the DAMA modulation for three values of v esc . DAMA-explaining cross sections are excluded at the 87% confidence level. Fluctuations of \u00b11 \u2022 \u03c3 in the cut efficiencies derived from neutron calibration would change this minimum CL within the range 85-89%. There is large uncertainty in the value of L eff in xenon at the lowest recoil energies. Around 20 keV, L eff is better constrained: it has been measured to 20% precision by several groups with mutual agreement [11]. The present result is insensitive to that level of uncertainty in the electron-equivalent energy of the 20 keV box edge. The additional event below the 8.4 keVee bound lies at 4.9 keVee, and anyway is close enough to the nuclear recoil median in S2/S1 that its inclusion would not reduce the observed maximum patch.",

This mass range is smaller than those reported by other xenon and germanium experiments [22,23,5] and supports previous exclusions [17] based on CRESST-II data.
