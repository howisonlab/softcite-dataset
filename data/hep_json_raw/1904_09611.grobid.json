            "text": "The Tokai-to-Kamioka (T2K) experiment [1] is a long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment that started taking physics data in 2010. The T2K experiment studies the properties of neutrino oscillations via the disappearance of muon (anti-)neutrinos and the appearance of electron (anti-)neutrinos from a nearly pure muon (anti-)neutrino beam, which is produced by the J-PARC accelerator complex. The neutrino beam characteristics and neutrino-nucleus interactions are measured with a suite of near detectors, which are situated 280 m from the production target, consisting of the so-called INGRID [2] and ND280 [3][4][5][6][7]. The INGRID is placed at the center of the neutrino beam (on-axis), while the ND280 is at an off-axis angle of 2.5 \u2022 . The neutrino oscillation patterns are observed with the 2.5 \u2022 off-axis far detector, Super-Kamiokande [8], which is located 295 km away from the production target. In order to precisely measure neutrino oscillations, understanding of the neutrino interactions with nuclei is essential. In the current T2K oscillation analysis [9], data samples of charged-current candidates in which the interaction vertex is found in one of two fine-grained detectors, FGD1 or FGD2 [4], are used to constrain the neutrino flux prediction and cross section models. The former detector consists of 100% plastic scintillators (hydrocarbon) and the latter consists of a mixture of plastic scintillators and water, while the far detector consists of 100% water.",

            "text": "The neutrino interaction model is used to extrapolate the near detector spectra to the (oscillated) far detector spectra in a few significant ways. First, the T2K off-axis near detector angular acceptance is more limited than the far detector. Second, the near detector event rate also includes significant interactions on materials other than the far detector (water) target. Finally, the interaction model is tuned at the near detector to predict the far detector energy spectra and this parameterization can be incomplete. Therefore, testing the interaction model with different target materials and at various ranges of neutrino energies is valuable to the T2K oscillation analysis. However, there have only been a few publications of the neutrino cross sections on water so far [10][11][12]. Two exclusive channels of charged-current interactions are measured by the ND280 [10,11] with approximately 15% uncertainties with a mean neutrino energy of 0.6 GeV. There is only one measurement of axial vector mass [12] with 10% uncertainty with a mean neutrino energy above 1 GeV.",

In this article, by using the Water Module and the other T2K detectors including the Proton Module [14] and INGRID [2], we measure the \u03bd \u03bc charged-current (CC) cross sections on water, hydrocarbon, iron, and their ratios. Dominant errors of the absolute cross section measurements come from the uncertainty of the T2K neutrino beam prediction, which largely cancels out when performing measurements on their cross section ratios. This method was established in the previous measurement of a cross section ratio between hydrocarbon and iron by using the Proton Module and INGRID [14]. In this article, measurements of neutrino interaction on water with the Water Module are conducted for the first time.

The Water Module has been located at the on-axis position between the INGRID horizontal modules and vertical modules since June 2016, replacing the Proton Module. The Water Module consists of a stainless steel tank filled with water and 16 scintillator tracking planes immersed in the water, as shown in Fig. 3. The eight tracking planes are placed alternately in the x-direction and y-direction along the z-direction so that 3D tracks may be reconstructed. Each tracking plane is an array of 80 scintillator bars. Half of these bars, called parallel scintillators, are placed along the xy-direction. The other 40 bars, called grid scintillators, are placed along the z-direction with a grid-like structure in order to achieve a large angular acceptance. The plastic scintillators of dimension 100 cm (length) \u00d7 2.5 cm (width) \u00d7 0.3 cm (thickness) were produced in the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory [15]. The scintillators are made of polystyrene, infused with PPO (1%) and POPOP (0.03%). The manufactured scintillator, co-extruded with a white reflective coating of TiO 2 infused in polystyrene, has a rectangular cross section with a groove to house a wavelength shifting (WLS) fiber (Kuraray Y-11 [16]). The WLS fiber is glued onto the scintillator with optical cement (Eljen Technology EJ-500 [17]). The surface of the scintillator is painted with a black cement of acrylic silicon to prevent optical crosstalk between the scintillators. Each layer of scintillator bars is affixed to a mechanical frame that sits inside a water tank. Spaces between scintillators are filled with water. Scintillation light from the scintillator is collected by the WLS fiber and detected by a multi-pixel photon counter (MPPC) [18], similar to that for the INGRID and Proton Module. While the Hamamatsu S10362-13-050C MPPC was used in the INGRID and Proton Module, a newer type of MPPC, S13660 with higher gain, lower noise rate, crosstalk rate, and after-pulse rate, is used in the Water Module. The same Trip-t electronics [19] are used for all three detectors. To record data from the neutrino beam, delivered typically in eight bunches with a cycle of 581 ns for each 2.48 s, a trigger from the J-PARC accelerator is provided to each detector. The integrated charge and hit timing of all channels are digitized and recorded with a 2.5 photoelectron (p.e.) threshold for each beam bunch.",

            "text": "A Monte Carlo (MC) simulation is used for the estimation of background contamination and signal detection efficiency. Three pieces of software are used for the chain of simulation: JNUBEAM [20] for the neutrino flux prediction, NEUT [21] for the neutrino interactions with nuclei, and a GEANT4 [22]based detector simulation. JNUBEAM simulates the interaction of 30 GeV primary protons on a graphite target, the propagation of the secondary and tertiary produced mesons in the magnetic fields induced by the magnetic horns, and their decays in the decay volume. The simulation uses the proton beam profiles measured by the J-PARC neutrino beam line and is tuned with external hadron production measurements, mainly from the NA61/SHINE experiment [23,24]. We can select either a muon neutrino beam or a muon anti-neutrino beam by changing the current polarity of the focusing magnetic horns. In this analysis, data collected in the former beam configuration are used. The simulated on-axis neutrino beam has a mean energy of 1.   For a given flux of incoming neutrinos, NEUT simulates the neutrino interactions with nuclei, including initial and final state interactions inside the nuclei, in order to provide the four-momenta of all induced particles. In this analysis, version 5.3.3 of NEUT is used. CC quasi-elastic (CCQE)like, neutral-current (NC) elastic, CC and NC single pion production (1\u03c0), deep inelastic scattering (DIS), multi-pion production, and coherent interactions are simulated. The CCQE-like interactions, characterized by the inclusion of a single charged lepton and no mesons in the final state, are simulated with a relativistic Fermi gas model (RFG) [25], random phase approximation (RPA) [26], and multi-nucleon (2p2h) interactions [27]. In addition to the nominal NEUT model, we test the sensitivity of the analysis to determining alternate available models [28]. Table 2 shows the nominal settings for each of the interaction models and tunable parameters in NEUT in this analysis. More details about the underlying neutrino interaction models implemented in NEUT that are used in the analysis can be found in Ref. [29].  are CCQE 1 , CC1\u03c0, CC multi-pion, and DIS production. The fraction of NC interaction is 30% of all interactions. Figure 5 shows the momentum and scattering angle distributions in the laboratory frame for muons produced by \u03bd \u03bc CC interactions. In this analysis, due to the limited acceptance of the horizontal INGRID modules to be used for muon identification for the Water Module and Proton Module as described in Sect. 5.5, we define the signal with a restricted phase space of muon kinematics, particularly CC interactions with \u03b8 \u03bc < 45 \u2022 and p \u03bc > 0.4 GeV/c in the laboratory frame. The cross section of the signal per nucleon is predicted by NEUT to be slightly different amongst H 2 O, CH, and Fe, as shown in Table 3. This is due to the target dependence of the total cross section of the CC coherent interaction, which is proportional to the square of the atomic number, and the difference in the fraction of neutrons and protons per nucleus for the targets considered.",

The responses of the scintillator, MPPC, and electronics are modeled based on the measurements, as shown in Table 1. The energy deposited in the scintillators estimated by GEANT4 is converted to the observed number of p.e. by multiplying it by a constant determined from measurements with minimum ionization particles (MIP), performed during the detector operation.

The main signature of CC interactions is the presence of a muon-like track produced inside the detector. Neutrino interactions originating from outside the detectors, CC interactions with non-target materials inside the detectors (mainly scintillators for the studied case with the Water Module), \u03bd \u03bc , \u03bd e , \u03bd e CC interactions, and NC interactions are the main sources of background in this analysis. The background from the NC interactions does not produce muons. In order to identify the muons originating from the Water Module and Proton Module, events on the Water Module or Proton Module are required to have a track that penetrates at least two iron planes in one of the three horizontal INGRID modules near the beam center. This method for muon identification limits the phase space of the induced muon, because we reject the CC interactions with low-momentum muons, which do not penetrate the iron planes, and high-angle muons, which do not enter the three INGRID modules. The event selections applied to the three detectors are similar to that from a previous analysis [14], achieving a similar selection performance for the cross section measurements in the three targets.

Table 8 shows the number of selected events before and after the pileup correction.

The signal efficiency is almost constant as a function of muon momentum, while it depends on the muon scattering angle. In this analysis, the cross section is calculated by a sum of the differential cross sections as a function of the muon scattering angle, as described in Sect. 6.

The uncertainty on the flux prediction takes into account the uncertainties in the measurements of the external hadron scattering experiments, mainly from NA61/SHINE [23,24], hadronic interaction models, and uncertainties in the beam profile measurements with the beam line monitors. Details of the sources of the flux uncertainty can be found in Ref. [20]. Figure 16 shows the calculated total on-axis flux uncertainty as a function of neutrino energy. The dominant ones come from uncertainties of hadronic interactions. The uncertainty of the neutrino flux is related to systematic uncertainties on the number of expected backgrounds (N BG ), integrated flux ( ), detection efficiency (\u03b5), and reconstructed-to-true transfer matrix (U ). To evaluate the systematic effects on the cross section measurement, the number of produced and selected neutrino events in each bin of the reconstructed track angle and true muon scattering angle is varied by using the calculated flux uncertainty, including correlations between the true neutrino energy bins. Therefore the variations of N BG , , \u03b5, and U are calculated and the variation of the cross section result is determined. This is repeated for many toy data sets and the 68% range of the distribution of the cross section variation around the central value is taken as the size of the flux-related systematic uncertainty. The first row in Table 13 shows the calculated flux uncertainties. They are approximately 10% for the absolute cross section measurement and 1-2% for the cross section ratios.",

To evaluate the model-related effect on the cross section measurement, for each \u00b1 1\u03c3 variation of a given interaction model parameter, a deviation of the cross section from the nominal value calculated based on the induced variation of \u03b5, N BG , and U is set as a systematic uncertainty. Table 14 shows the nominal values and the uncertainties of the neutrino interaction parameters. More details about the simulation models used can be found in Ref. [29]. In addition, uncertainties from pion final state interactions inside nuclei are taken into account: for each type of interaction, the uncertainties are assigned as normalization, as shown in Table 14. When the uncertainty is calculated, no correlation amongst the different target nuclei for the Fermi momentum (p F ), binding energy (E b ), 2p2h, and CC coherent normalizations is assumed. Full correlation amongst the different nuclei is assumed for the other parameters. Table 15 shows the calculated uncertainties and they are in a range between 2.6% and 5.2%. The dominant ones come from the uncertainties of the axial vector mass of the CCQE, CC1\u03c0 , and the energy-dependent normalization of the CC multi-pion and DIS production.  from outside of the detector is not included here, although it affects N BG . It is calculated as one of the detector systematics, as described in Sect. 7.3. In addition to the systematic effects estimated by NEUT, the uncertainties of backscattered protons and pions produced by neutrino interactions with nuclei, which mainly affect the position of the reconstructed vertex, are estimated independently. A fraction of the events generated inside the fiducial volume have reconstructed vertices outside the fiducial volume due to backscattered secondary protons or pions. The fraction of such events is 3.0% for the Water Module, 1.6% for the Proton Module, and 2.0% for the INGRID module with respect to the total number of selected events. The number and the uncertainty of such backscattered secondary particles may not be simulated well by NEUT, so a 50% conservative uncertainty is assumed, which leads to 1.5%, 0.8%, and 1.0% uncertainties for the Water Module, Proton Module, and INGRID module respectively in the total number of selected events. This is taken to be the 1\u03c3 uncertainty for all reconstructed angle bins. In addition, no correlations between the target materials are assumed for this error. 24  Fig. 18.

We take into account the following errors: target mass, MPPC noise, scintillator crosstalk, hit efficiency of the scintillator, event pileup, beam-induced backgrounds from outside of the detector, 2D tracking efficiency, and 3D tracking efficiency. In addition, the uncertainties of the reconstructed variables used for the event selections are taken into account as follows: 2D track matching with the INGRID modules, 3D track matching, vertexing, beam timing cut, veto and fiducial volume cut, and reconstructed angle cut. The effect from non-beam-induced backgrounds is estimated to be less than 0.1% with beam-off data and is not included in the systematic uncertainties. The effect of the true and reconstructed muon angle binning is estimated to be less than 0.2% by changing the bin size and is not included in the systematic uncertainties. In order to evaluate these uncertainties on the cross section measurement, MC simulations are produced by varying detector parameters independently within their uncertainties by 1\u03c3 . The difference in the number of selected events in each bin of reconstructed track angle with respect to varying their uncertainty by 1\u03c3 defines the 1\u03c3 standard deviation systematic uncertainty in the number of events. Table 16 shows a summary of the uncertainties from the detector response for the absolute cross sections. For the measurements of the cross section ratios, no correlation is assumed between the three detectors except for the beam-induced backgrounds from outside the detector, which is treated as a common uncertainty. The fourth row in Table 13 shows the total uncertainty from the detector response. It is approximately 2% for the absolute cross section measurement and 4% for the cross section ratios because most of the systematics do not cancel between the detectors.",
