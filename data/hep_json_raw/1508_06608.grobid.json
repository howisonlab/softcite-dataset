Results from 22 separate ATLAS searches are considered, each based on analysis of up to 20.3 fb \u22121 of proton-proton collision data at centre-of-mass energies of \u221a s = 7 and 8 TeV at the Large Hadron Collider. The results are interpreted in the context of the 19-parameter phenomenological minimal supersymmetric standard model, in which the lightest supersymmetric particle is a neutralino, taking into account constraints from previous precision electroweak and flavour measurements as well as from dark matter related measurements. The results are presented in terms of constraints on supersymmetric particle masses and are compared to limits from simplified models. The impact of ATLAS searches on parameters such as the dark matter relic density, the couplings of the observed Higgs boson, and the degree of electroweak fine-tuning is also shown. Spectra for surviving supersymmetry model points with low fine-tunings are presented.",

            "text": "During the first run of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the ATLAS [1] and CMS [2] Collaborations performed a wide range of searches for supersymmetry (SUSY) [3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11], using proton-proton (pp) collision data at centre-of-mass energies ( \u221a s) of 7 and 8 TeV. SUSY, a theoretically favoured framework for extending the Standard Model (SM), is able to address some of its unanswered questions, particularly the hierarchy problem [12][13][14][15], which is related to the fine-tuning needed to obtain the correct mass for the observed Higgs boson. SUSY can also provide credible dark matter candidates [16,17] and can improve the unification of the electroweak and strong interactions [18][19][20][21][22][23][24][25][26].",

It predicts a pair of scalar partners -one for each fermion chirality -for each of the SM quarks and leptons. These spin-zero partner particles are known as squarks (q) and sleptons (\u02dc ) respectively. In the first two generations the pair of chiral partners is largely unmixed, so the mass states can be labelled\u1ebd L and\u1ebd R , where the L and R subscripts denote the scalar partners of the left-and right-handed Standard Model fermion states respectively. In the third generation of quarks and leptons the mixing between the scalars is larger, and the mixed states are labelled by their mass indices e.g.t 1 and t 2 , wheret 1 is lighter by construction. Each state in the SM gluon colour octet has a spinhalf partner known as a gluinog. There are a total of eight spin-half partners of the electroweak gauge and Higgs bosons: the neutral bino (superpartner of the U(1) gauge field); the winos, which are a charged pair and a neutral particle (superpartners of the W bosons of the SU(2) L gauge fields); and the Higgsinos, which are two neutral particles and a charged pair (superpartners of the Higgs field's degrees of freedom). The bino, winos and Higgsinos mix to form four charged states called charginos\u03c7 \u00b1 1,2 , and four neutral states known as neutralinos\u03c7 0 i (where the index i lies in the range 1 to 4, ordered by increasing neutralino mass). The charginos and neutralinos are collectively referred to as electroweakinos.",

One frequently used strategy for interpretation is in terms of models motivated by a particular mechanism of SUSY-breaking, for example via gravitational or gauge interactions. While such models can have theoretically appealing features, they assert relationships between SUSY-breaking parameters that may not be realised in nature, and they sample only a small part of the parameter space of the MSSM. SUSY searches at the LHC have also been interpreted using 'simplified' models. Such models attempt to capture the behaviour of a small number of kinematically accessible sparticles, assuming all others play no role. The simplest case corresponds to one specific SUSY production process with a fixed decay chain. Such models provide insight into the experimental constraints on the individual sparticle and decay mode, but fail to capture the complex effects that can result from large numbers of competing production and decay processes.",

This parameter space is too large to be scanned exhaustively and compared to ATLAS data. By applying a series of assumptions motivated by either experimental constraints or general features of possible SUSY breaking mechanisms, the number of parameters can be reduced to 19. This is known as the phenomenological MSSM (pMSSM) [32][33][34]. This model is assumed to conserve R parity, 1 which ensures that sparticles are produced in pairs and the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) is stable. The parameters are assumed to be real so that new CP violation does not occur in the sparticle sector. Parameters that would give rise to additional flavour-changing neutral currents are absent. The LSP provides a dark matter candidate if colourless and electrically neutral. In this paper, the LSP is required to be the lightest neutralino. Its production at the LHC gives rise to missing transverse momentum (whose magnitude is denoted E miss T ), which is required by most of the ATLAS searches considered in this paper. There is no theoretical upper bound on the parameters characterising the sparticle masses. However, since the experiments have no sensitivity to sparticles with very large masses, the following additional restriction is applied before a specific set of parameters is considered: all sparticle masses must be less than 4 TeV. A specific set of the 19 parameters is referred to as a model point in parameter space; 310,327 such model points, each consistent with a range of previous experimental results, are considered. More details about the selection of pMSSM points can be found in section 3.",

Most of these studies use estimated experimental efficiencies and acceptances for pMSSM points, and compare them to the model-independent limits from a selection of LHC searches to constrain the pMSSM parameter space. Previous ATLAS analyses have also used the pMSSM for interpretation of individual searches [53][54][55][56][57] by fixing most of the parameters, and varying just two or three: they therefore explore only a small part of the parameter space. This paper makes full use of the ATLAS experimental simulation, reconstruction and analysis tools.

It is assumed that the LSP abundance is determined thermally and is not diluted by other processes e.g. late-time entropy addition. No assumption is made about whether the LSP is the sole constituent of dark matter. As a result, the total cold dark matter energy density is used as an upper limit on the LSP abundance. The limit is based on the latest combined measurement from the Planck Collaboration of \u2126 CDM h 2 = 0.1188 \u00b1 0.0010 (table 4 of ref. [97]). 2 The upper limit is set to the observed central value plus double the experimental uncertaintity. The limit on the spin-independent cross-section is that for the interaction of a neutralino with a nucleus derived by the LUX experiment [98]. In the case of the LSP mass versus proton spin-dependent cross-section plane the limit is from the COUPP Collaboration [99], while in the LSP mass versus neutron spin-dependent cross-section plane, the XENON100 Collaboration [100] limit is applied. MicrOMEGAs 3.5.5 is used to calculate the neutralino-nucleon cross-sections. These are scaled down by the ratio of the expected relic density from the LSP to the observed relic density to obtain the effective dark matter cross-sections, assuming the remaining non-LSP dark matter is invisible to the direct detection experiments. When accepting or rejecting models, the calculated value is allowed to be up to a factor of four higher than the limits obtained by the experiments, to account for nucleon form-factor uncertainties [33].",

To ensure consistency with LEP, model points are discarded if their additional contribution to the invisible width of the Z boson is above 2 MeV [101], or where any charged sparticle is lighter than 100 GeV. For charginos, the bound is increased to 103 GeV, provided that all sneutrinos are heavier than 160 GeV and the mass splitting between the chargino and the LSP is at least 2 GeV. This constraint comes from the combined  LEP search [102]. First-and second-generation squarks are required to be heavier than 200 GeV, although this has only a very small effect given the scan range and the assumption of negligible first-and second-generation squark mixing. The lightest Higgs boson mass, as calculated by FeynHiggs 2.10.0 [103,104], is required to be in the range 124 to 128 GeV. This range is set around the central value of the Higgs mass at the time of generation, 126 GeV, and with a 2 GeV window that mainly reflects the typical theoretical uncertainty of the FeynHiggs calculation. The results are found not to depend on the exact value of the Higgs mass within this interval (as shown later in section 5.4).",

The constraint depends strongly on the nature of the LSP.

The model points are therefore partitioned into three categories, bino-like, wino-like and Higgsino-like. The categorisation is made according to the dominant contribution to the LSP within the neutralino mixing matrix N ij as shown in  plots, where all LSP types are shown together the contribution from each LSP type is scaled according to the weights shown in table 4.",

Light gluinos are more common among model points with bino-like LSP. Dark matter for model points with bino-like LSP is typically over-produced, so the presence of a gluino state close in mass to the LSP enables them to act as coannihilators with the dark matter in the early universe, reducing the relic density to a level that satisfies the constraint on \u2126\u03c70 1 h 2 . The neutralino mass distribution for the bino-like LSP model points shows a sharp concentration of model points with m(\u03c7 0 1 ) 100 GeV. This concentration corresponds to model points in which the dark matter relic density constraint can be satisfied due to enhanced neutralino pair annihilation via the Z or Higgs boson poles. A plot of the lowmass region for bino-LSP model points (shown in the inset to figure 1(a)) confirms this interpretation, showing two individual peaks corresponding to the separate Z and Higgs poles.",

The remaining NLSP types are generally ordered by their effectiveness as coannihilators, with coloured NLSPs being the most prevalent and neutral NLSPs (sneutrinos) being the least so.

The production processes are split into three separate groups: strong production, electroweak production (encompassing electroweakino and slepton pair production) and finally mixed production (e.g. of an electroweakino in association with a squark or gluino). Model points with cross sections for any of those processes larger than the minimum values in table 5 are subsequently retained, and any such processes are investigated in more detail as described below. For strong and mixed production, the minimum cross-section corresponds to just five signal events produced in the full \u221a s = 8 TeV dataset. Sensitivity to such small cross-sections occurs only for model points with a very high fraction of events with four leptons in the final state, for which the 4-leptons analysis has a high acceptance (up to 50%). Production of electroweakinos is most effectively observed by using decays to leptons, which are often suppressed by the leptonic branching fractions of W , Z and h bosons, explaining the higher cross-sections limits. ATLAS searches have a greater sensitivity to low cross-section slepton pair production than to electroweakino production. Therefore, if the model point does not satisfy the higher cross-section criterion of the electroweak production group, a fourth group that allows for model points with lower cross-section slepton pair production is considered. Fewer than 10% of the model points have no process passing this selection and are thus not considered to be excludable.",

In this step, inefficiencies from the detector-level reconstruction are parameterised using a single efficiency factor for each signal region, determined from previously simulated signal samples. Exceptions to this are made for the \u03c4 reconstruction efficiency in the \u03c4 (\u03c4 / ) + jets + E miss T and 2-\u03c4 searches, for which p T -dependent efficiencies are applied for each signal \u03c4 . Similarly, the Disappearing Track search applies the reconstruction efficiency for decaying charginos as a function of the distance from the centre of the ATLAS detector and the angular coordinates as published in ref. [72]. The expected event yield in each signal region is calculated for each model point. For most analyses the categorisation is performed by directly comparing the expected signal yield N sig to the model-independent 95% confidence level (CL) upper bound on the number of beyond-the-SM events N 95 max in each signal region of that analysis. Model points are then partitioned into three categories, on the basis of that particle-level simulation, using criteria determined to be appropriate for each individual analysis. The first category comprised those already excluded at this stage on the basis that N sig is sufficiently larger than N 95 max for at least one signal region of one analysis. The expected sensitivity of all other analyses to such model points is calculated using particle-level yields, and using average reconstruction efficiencies. The second category corresponds to those found not to be excludable, consisting of points with N sig materially smaller than N 95 max for all analyses. The exact relationship between N sig and N 95 max for the categorisation is determined separately for each signal region and depends on the accuracy with which the particle-level evaluation reproduces the results of a full simulation. In total 35.9% (44.7%) of the model points fall in the first (second) category and are deemed to have been excluded (not excluded) at the 95% CL. The validity of this classification was confirmed using the full simulation and reconstruction procedure described below for approximately 5% of the model points in the first category for each analysis. A final category of model points -those with N sig close to N 95 max (typically within a factor of a few) for the most sensitive analyses -are subject to more detailed investigation, as follows.",

In each analysis the signal region with the best expected sensitivity is identified and the \"CLs method\" [126] is used to determine if the model point is excluded or not at 95% CL. It should be noted that for the exclusion fits, the nominal signal cross-sections are used, without any theoretical uncertainties on the signal, except for the Monojet stop and Monojet analyses. These two analyses are particularly sensitive to the modelling of ISR as they rely on a high-p T ISR jet in their event selection. Therefore an additional 25% ISR signal uncertainty is applied in those cases, based on the observed variance in acceptance in signal samples with modified parameters for the ISR modelling [67]. For the 0-lepton + 7-10 jets + E miss T , 0/1-lepton + 3b-jets + E miss T and 2-leptons stop analyses, it is not possible to apply the full combined fit procedure of the original analyses. Instead only the individual signal regions are considered, resulting in somewhat conservative modelling of the sensitivity for those three analyses. For the overall exclusion, no attempt is made to combine the individual analyses. Instead the analysis with the best expected exclusion is used for each model point to determine its status.",

For example, the pMSSM permits the existence of additional particles with masses lying in between those of the gluino and the LSP, which can lead to cascade decays.

This is primarily because the pMSSM-19 parameter space does not demand that the squarks be eight-fold degenerate, reducing the cross-section. There is a closer correspondence between the pMSSM sensitivity and that of an alternative simplified model (dashed line), in which the cross-section for direct (anti-)squark production has been reduced by a factor of four, to model the effect of only two of those eight squarks being mass degenerate. 5 A noticeable excursion from the simplified-model lines, visible on both plots in figure 3 is a horizontal band of sensitivity to pMSSM points for LSP masses less than about 200 GeV stretching up to large gluino (orq) masses. Since such high-mass strongly interacting sparticles have small production cross-sections, one would not expect sensitivity to their production. Indeed these constraints are not the result of gluino or squark searches, but instead of searches for disappearing tracks from long-lived charginos. These long-lived chargino states are common for models with wino-like LSPs with mass splittings between the charged NLSP and the neutral LSP of less than about 200 MeV. The NLSP, when it decays inside the detector volume, produces an invisible LSP and a low-energy charged pion which itself often goes undetected. The search for such 'disappearing' charged-particle tracks is sensitive even in the absence of direct squark or gluino production, and hence sensitivity is observed for any mass of the strongly interacting sparticle. Figure 4(a) shows the sensitivity as projected onto the plane of the gluino and squark masses, where now the LSP mass may take any value. One observes near-total exclusion by ATLAS analyses of gluinos with masses less than about 700 GeV, with a high fraction of exclusion up to about 1.2 TeV, for all values of the lightest squark mass. Light squarks are also strongly constrained, although those constraints weaken as the gluino mass increases, due to suppression both of direct squark-pair production via t-channel gluino exchange and of associated production ofq +g.",

The reduction in sensitivity caused by a non-zero LSP mass is more pronounced in the case of model points with a bino-like LSP, figure 4(b).

The fraction of model points excluded is compared to simplified models in which either only left-or right-handed sleptons (\u1ebd and\u03bc) are produced.

No definitive lower bound can be placed on the stau mass by ATLAS after Run 1.   is for a simplified model that assumes pure-wino\u03c7 \u00b1 1 +\u03c7 0 2 production, followed by the decays\u03c7 \u00b1 1\u03c7 0",

Nevertheless it is often the case that a model which produces an excess in one search can have a significant signal expectation in others, since related cascade decays can lead to complementary final states.

For example, one can observe that of the model points that were excluded by the 1-lepton + jets + E miss T analysis (fourth row from bottom), 93% were also excluded by the 0-lepton + 2-6 jets + E miss T analysis (first column). Figure 13 demonstrates that there is a good complementarity -relatively small overlap in sensitivity -between searches for strongly interacting particles, which are characterised by final states with jets, and searches for electroweak production.

The degree of apparent overlap is subjective, in that it depends, in some cases sensitively, on the metric used when sampling the pMSSM space. Even in cases where the apparent overlap appears to be large, for example between the 0-lepton + 2-6 jets + E miss T and 0-lepton + 7-10 jets + E miss T analyses, both searches are found to have regions of pMSSM space in which they provide unique sensitivity.

            "text": "The effect of the relic density preselection can be seen in figure 14(a), which shows the density of pMSSM points in the plane of the\u03c7 0 1 relic density (\u2126(\u03c7 0 1 )h 2 ) versus the mass of the\u03c7 0 1 . The model points with a bino-like LSP are shown in red, while those with wino-like and Higgsino-like LSPs are in blue and green respectively. The features at low LSP mass are due to the effective annihilation of LSPs through s-channel Z or Higgs bosons -the so-called Z-funnel and Higgs-funnel regions. There are few wino-or Higgsinodominated LSPs at low mass since in such cases the\u03c7 0 1 is expected to be accompanied by an almost degenerate chargino, which would have been observed at LEP [102]. Most of the models with wino-and Higgsino-dominated LSPs lie on bands which are almost straight lines on the logarithmic plot, since the thermally averaged annihilation cross-section is expected to be proportional to the inverse square of the LSP mass, resulting in almost exact proportionality between \u2126(\u03c7 0 1 )h 2 and m(\u03c7 0 1 ) 2 . Figure 14(b) shows the distribution of model points in the same plane after applying the constraints from the ATLAS SUSY searches. Considering first the bino-dominated LSP model points, one observes that model points are excluded by the ATLAS searches across a wide range of LSP masses (and expected relic densities). It is found that the ATLAS searches have some sensitivity up to m(\u03c7 0 1 ) 800 GeV, while at low bino mass about two-thirds of the LSP model points in the Z-and Higgs-funnel regions are excluded. For wino-dominated LSPs, the overall range of sensitivity in m(\u03c7 0 1 ) again extends up to about 800 GeV. Model points with m(\u03c7 0 1 ) 220 GeV are particularly depleted by the ATLAS searches with about 80% of model points with wino-like LSPs in this mass range being excluded, mostly by the sensitivity of the Disappearing Track analysis to the charged wino. For Higgsino-dominated LSPs, the ATLAS sensitivity is smaller as the\u03c7 \u00b1 1 -\u03c7 0 1 mass splittings are mostly too large to have an observable\u03c7 \u00b1 1 lifetime. Focusing on model points with bino-dominated LSPs, figure 15 shows the model point density before and after ATLAS Run 1 searches. In this figure the colour code now corresponds to the dominant annihilation mechanism of the dark matter -for example an orange point has at least one squark of the first two generations, or the gluino, close in mass to the LSP, allowing annihilation mechanisms such asq +\u03c7 0 1 \u2192 q + \u03b3 to proceed effectively. The vertical cut-offs for each coannihilator correspond to the preselection from previous experimental constraints -for example charged sparticles lighter than 100 GeV are forbidden. The different minima seen for the relic dark matter energy density for each coannihilator correspond to the different coupling strengths.",

The direct detection limits include the additional uncertainties described in section 3.2.2. In each case the interaction cross-section is scaled by a factor of R \u2126 = \u2126(\u03c7 0 1 )h 2 /\u2126 Planck h 2 , since in this paper it is assumed that the LSP may be only one of a range of possible contributors 6 to the dark matter abundance, whereas direct detection experiments interpret their results in a framework in which the LSP completely saturates the relic density. Figure 16(a) shows the model points projected onto the plane of the spin-independent interaction cross-section versus the LSP mass. The direct detection limit from the LUX experiment is shown, in which, as already mentioned, the relic density of the colliding dark matter was assumed to saturate the value measured by the Planck Collaboration. The only model points with LSP mass less than 100 GeV are those with bino-like LSPs lying in the Higgs-or Z-funnel regions. Around 15% of the bino-like model points that pass the preselection (table 3) would have been excluded by the nominal LUX limit had the additional uncertainty scaling factor of four, as mentioned in section 3.2.2, not been applied. Figure 16(b) shows the same space after removing model points excluded (at 95% CL) by the ATLAS Run 1 searches. Figure 16(c) shows the spin-dependent cross-section, again as a function of the neutralino mass. The plot also shows the corresponding direct detection exclusion limit, this time from the COUPP experiment. The same plot is shown after ATLAS Run 1 search constraints in figure 16(d). Again one can see that sensitivity from LHC searches can stretch to regions with cross-sections several orders of magnitude below those of the current best direct detection experiments. Similar conclusions are found for spin-dependent neutron cross-sections, in this case the best direct detection limit being from Xenon-100 [100].  Figure 16. Left, the distribution of model points generated; right, the distribution of model points not excluded by ATLAS Run 1 searches, as projected onto the scaled spin-independent (SI) interaction cross-section of nucleons with the neutralino versus the neutralino mass. The cross-sections are scaled by a factor of R \u2126 = \u2126(\u03c7 0 1 )h 2 /\u2126 Planck h 2 . The calculated spin-independent interaction cross-sections are a weighted average of the contributions from proton and neutron scattering, corresponding to the Xenon atom (the target nucleus of the LUX experiment) and normalised to one nucleon. The 90% confidence limit [98] from the LUX direct detection experiment is overlaid, in which it is assumed that the dark matter comprises only the LSP, with relic density as measured by the Planck Collaboration [97]. For the spin-dependent cross-sections, the calculated proton crosssection is shown. It is compared to the direct detection limit from the COUPP experiment [99].  tectable in that analysis. As the degree of Higgsino mixing increases, the direct detection cross-sections increase, and so does the LSP-NLSP mass splitting. This results in a more rapid NLSP decay, and lack of sensitivity by ATLAS.",

The upper limit on the invisible branching ratio, taking account of both visible and invisible Higgs boson decay channels is reported in ref.

The exceptions -those two parameters which are already sufficiently well measured to constrain the pMSSM -are discussed below.

This expected region contains almost all the pMSSM points not excluded by the direct searches, so the expected constraint from \u03ba b is negligible. The current ATLAS observed fitted value for \u03ba b is 0.62 \u00b1 0.28 at 68% CL [145]. This value is lower than, but consistent with, the SM value. The corresponding observed 95% CL spans the range |\u03ba b | < 1.2, and is more restrictive than the expected range. As a result the observed fit disfavours those pMSSM points (see figure 17(a)) with \u03ba b > 1.2, which typically are those with large tan \u03b2. Those models that are disfavoured at the 95% CL represent a weighted fraction of 3.1% of all the pMSSM points. This fraction is rather similar before and after the ATLAS Run 1 direct searches are considered.",

The expected branching ratio for decay of a light Higgs boson via ZZ * to neutrinos is O(10 \u22123 ), much smaller than the present experimental uncertainties, and so is negligible in this context. No models with a sufficiently light wino-or Higgsino-like LSP satisfied the initial constraints of section 3.2, so only models with a bino-dominated LSP need be considered in this context. All such LSPs have some wino and Higgsino admixture, allowing them to couple to the Higgs boson. Figure 17(b) shows the calculated distribution of the lightest Higgs boson's invisible branching ratio for those pMSSM points with bino-like LSPs and having m(\u03c7 0 1 ) < 65 GeV. To account for finite-width effects, this selection allows for models with LSP masses a little above m(h)/2. These light-LSP models represent 4.5% of the model points with bino-like LSPs that survive the ATLAS searches in table 1. The observed ATLAS bound on the h invisible branching ratio is BR(h \u2192\u03c7 0 1 +\u03c7 0 1 ) < 0.23 at the 95% CL [145]. This observed value is close to the expected upper limit of 0.24.

            "text": "The effect of the ATLAS Run 1 searches on the distribution of pMSSM points as projected onto the expected values of these precision observables is shown in figure 18. In each case the most noticeable feature is that the ATLAS direct searches remove pMSSM points rather uniformly across the space of each precision variable, demonstrating the complementarity of the searches. The direct searches from Run 1 have placed tight constraints on the strongly interacting sector of the pMSSM, whereas the precision variables depend on other sparticles, for example the smuon and electroweakino masses, which are less tightly constrained by direct searches so far. Figure 18 supports the statement in section 3.2.3 that the exclusion power of the ATLAS searches does not depend significantly on the mass range used for the light (SMlike) Higgs boson, the fraction of excluded model points being remarkably flat. The other three distributions: BR(B s \u2192 \u00b5\u00b5), BR(b \u2192 s\u03b3), and the \u2206(g \u2212 2) \u00b5 also show good exclusion by ATLAS for all values of the observables. It is noticeable that the majority of the pMSSM points have only small SUSY contributions to these observables, so those model points would not be expected to be discoverable by using those measurements in the near future. Nevertheless there exists, for each precision measurement, a small number of model points with SUSY contributions large enough to be discovered by each. One observes that ATLAS also tends to have slightly larger sensitivity to these 'tail' model points. This increased sensitivity is not surprising since these model points are generally those with some lighter SUSY particles contributing to the precision measurements via loop diagrams. This correlation becomes more clear in figure 19, which shows the number of generated model points in the plane of the \u2206(g \u2212 2) \u00b5 versus the mass of the lighter leftor right-handed smuon (min(m(\u03bc L ), m(\u03bc R ))). The experimentally measured value [89], represented by the hatched band, only overlaps a region where m(\u03bc) < 1 TeV. As noted previously in section 3.2.1, the allowed range used for \u2206(g \u2212 2) \u00b5 in this paper is the union of the 3\u03c3 intervals around the SM value and the experimental measurement. The experimentally measured value, if confirmed, would be a powerful constraint on the space.",

The shapes of the distributions are determined by the ranges of the pMSSM parameters considered. The dominant contributions to the fine-tuning come from \u00b5 and A t . It can also be observed that the ATLAS Run 1 searches exclude pMSSM points with a wide range of different fine-tuning values. A decrease in sensitivity is observed with increasing fine-tuning for models with a Higgsino-like LSP. This is an artifact caused by the fact that the Higgsino is the LSP, that its mass is driven by the \u00b5 parameter, and so by requiring large fine-tuning, one is indirectly requiring that there be a heavy LSP, reducing ATLAS sensitivity.",

The model point has a wino-dominated LSP with a mass of 107 GeV, which is lighter by 1.6 GeV than its charged partner. This mass difference is sufficient to ensure that the chargino lifetime is short enough (< 1 ps) to evade the Disappearing Track analysis. The lower part of the mass spectrum includes a Higgsino-dominated {\u03c7 0 2 ,\u03c7 0 3 ,\u03c7 \u00b1 2 } multiplet with masses around 230 GeV which are mixed with the winos at about the 10% level. Most strongly interacting sparticles, particularly the gluino and left-squark doublet, have large masses of around 3 TeV, which is beyond the Run 1 search reach. The heavy Higgs bosons are also beyond the Run 1 search reach.  Aside from model points with a wino-dominated or a Higgsino-dominated LSP there also remain model points with low fine-tuning and a mixed LSP. For example, figure 21(c) shows a model point with a mixed bino-Higgsino LSP a so-called 'well-tempered' neutralino case [105].

This can be a problem when the available two-body decays are suppressed by a small mixing angle (which can occur if the decaying gaugino is a neutral wino or Higgsino and the two-body decay is to a right-handed sfermion) or by kinematics. For this reason MadGraph5 aMC@NLO was employed to calculate the full three-body decays in cases where the decaying gaugino has a bino content below 10% and a right-handed sfermion is accessible, or has an accessible decay to any sfermion where the sfermion-gaugino splitting is below 20% of the gaugino-LSP splitting.

A neutralino LSP can annihilate through s-channel exchange of a Z or Higgs boson or through t-channel exchange of a chargino or sfermion. If another sparticle is nearly degenerate with the LSP, that sparticle can also enhance the effective LSP annihilation rate through coannihilation. In general, sparticles with the strongest self-interactions (particularly coloured sparticles) make the most effective coannihilators. Supersymmetric models with a wino-like LSP or Higgsino-like LSP (see table 4) have a chargino that is nearly degenerate with the LSP, resulting in a sizeable annihilation rate through chargino exchange; the degenerate JHEP10(2015)134",

On the other hand, bino-like LSPs (N 2 11 > max(N 2 12 , N 2 13 + N 2 14 )) have no guaranteed annihilation mechanism. One possibility is for the LSP to mix with the Higgsino [156], giving couplings to the Z and Higgs bosons and to the charginos. In order for the annihilation rate to be large enough, the Higgsino must be somewhat degenerate with the LSP (resulting in a large mixing angle) or the LSP must be approximately half the mass of the Z or MSSM Higgs bosons (termed a \"funnel\" region), producing a resonantly enhanced annihilation rate that compensates for the mixing-angle-suppressed couplings. Alternatively, a chargino or sfermion can be nearly degenerate with the LSP, resulting in a sizeable t-channel annihilation rate and/or significant coannihilation [157].",

Second, the absence of an associated chargino can significantly alter the available decay modes.
