A search for a CP -violating asymmetry that varies across the \u03c6 mass region of the D + \u2192 K \u2212 K + \u03c0 + Dalitz plot is also performed, and no evidence for CP violation is found. In addition, the CP asymmetry in the D + s \u2192 K 0 S \u03c0 + decay is measured to be (0.61 \u00b1 0.83 \u00b1 0.14)%.",

            "text": "Cabibbo-suppressed charm decays are the focus of searches for direct CP violation (CPV) in the charm sector. In these decays, direct CPV will occur if tree and loop (penguin) processes interfere with different strong and weak phases. Furthermore, contributions from physics beyond the Standard Model may appear in the virtual loops [1]. Evidence for direct CPV in charm decays was reported by LHCb and subsequently by CDF using the D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 K + and D 0 \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + channels [2,3]. Although the latest results do not confirm the evidence for CPV in the charm sector [4,5], further studies using different decay modes remain well motivated. The large branching ratios of D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 K + compared to D 0 \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + decays, and of the D + \u2192 K \u2212 K + \u03c0 + compared to the D + \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + mode, suggest that the contribution of the penguin amplitude may be significant in both D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 K + and D + \u2192 K \u2212 K + \u03c0 + decays [6]. The inclusion of charge conjugate decays is implied where appropriate throughout this paper. In D + decays, a non-zero CP asymmetry would indicate unambiguously the presence of direct CPV. The D + \u2192 \u03c6\u03c0 + decay is a particularly promising channel for CPV searches due to its large branching ratio of (2.65 \u00b1 0.09) \u00d7 10 \u22123 [7]. A recent investigation of this decay at the Belle experiment yielded a CP -violating charge asymmetry of (+0.51 \u00b1 0.28 \u00b1 0.05)% [8], while BaBar measured (\u22120.3 \u00b1 0.3 \u00b1 0.5)% [9].",

This decay is itself sensitive to CPV via the interference of Cabibbo-favoured and doubly Cabibbo-suppressed amplitudes.

To test the hypothesis that A CP | S can sometimes be more sensitive to CP violation than A CP , a study is performed using simulated pseudo-experiments in which plausible types of CPV are introduced into the CLEO-c amplitude model [14]. The matrix elements for D + and D \u2212 decays are separately modified in a number of ways, as specified in table 1, and events are generated from the resulting probability density functions. In each simulated sample, approximately the same number of events as in the dataset are produced, and the It was found in ref. [16] that the sensitivity to CPV can vary substantially with the details of the amplitude model. Therefore these simple simulations should not be treated as accurate predictions, but instead as a guide to the relative sensitivity of the two observables.",

The same situation could occur if one pion is bent inwards and so does not meet the hadron trigger E T threshold while a pion of the opposite charge is bent outwards and therefore has enough measured E T to activate the trigger. This cancels to a good approximation between the left and right halves of the detector, but any left/right asymmetry in the calorimeters or muon stations could result in imperfect cancellation, biasing the charge asymmetry. The effect of these asymmetries on this analysis is not eliminated by the subtraction of the asymmetries in the two final states in eq. 1.1 as the two decays do not have identical kinematic properties.

            "text": "However, non-cancelling effects can bias the measurement and are considered as sources of systematic uncertainty. The data triggered by the K 0 S or \u03c6 meson at the hardware level are charge-symmetric to a good approximation, and are assumed to be unbiased. However, in data triggered by another particle in the event, the particle that activates the trigger may be correlated to the signal decay. For example, a signal decay is often accompanied by a D \u00b1 meson of the opposite charge. If this meson decays to a charged hadron, electron or muon, the daughter particle, which is more likely to have the opposite charge to the signal D \u00b1 , could fire the trigger. The different kinematics and acceptance of the signal and control channel studied in this analysis mean that the cancellation of charge-asymmetric trigger efficiencies between them may not be complete. To study the size of this effect, a sample of approximately 57 million D + \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + decays is selected using the same criteria as those for the signal. The charge asymmetries in the differently triggered datasets are given in table 3. Small but significant discrepancies between data from different triggers are observed, indicating that the hardware triggers may introduce small biases into the dataset. The large difference between magnet up and magnet down data in the sample that is triggered by the muon detectors is due to a charge-asymmetric p T threshold in the detector, but this cancels when the magnet polarities are averaged. A systematic uncertainty equal to the maximum deviation from the average charge asymmetry of (\u22122.034 \u00b1 0.014)% in any of the triggers is assigned. This occurs in the electron trigger and the difference is 0.114%. The precision with which effects cancel between \u03c6\u03c0 + and K 0 S \u03c0 + final states in the analysis cannot be quantified accurately. Therefore the most conservative approach is adopted and no cancellation is assumed.  Table 3.

The measured asymmetry is found to be stable with variations in the binning, suggesting that the detector asymmetries are small. The results are summarised in table 4.

Thus a value of 0.169% is assigned as the main systematic uncertainty in A CP | S . The systematic uncertainty due to charged kaon interaction asymmetries is studied by determining the effect on the result of enlarging the size of the K \u2212 K + mass window under study. This increases the differences between the momentum spectra of the kaons, which increases the effect of the interaction asymmetry because it depends strongly on momentum. The consistency of this procedure is checked with simulation studies. The systematic uncertainty is found to be 0.031% in A CP for the D + decay, 0.002% for A CP in the D + s decay and 0.009% in A CP | S . The asymmetric interaction of the neutral kaons with detector material is studied using the method outlined in ref. [27] to account for coherent regeneration. The amount of material each kaon passes through before it decays and the predicted differences between the K 0 and K 0 material interaction cross sections [28] are used to determine an expected asymmetry. The size of the effect is found to be (0.039 \u00b1 0.004)%, where the uncertainty is due to imperfect knowledge of the amount of material in the detector. This is consistent with the dependence of the asymmetry on the depth of material passed through by the kaons seen in data.

The effects of background and of the reconstruction and signal selection efficiency variation across the \u03c6 region are negligible.The level of CPV in the pseudo-experiments is chosen to give an expected result with significance of around three Gaussian standard deviations in at least one observable. For each type of CPV, twenty Dalitz plots are simulated. The mean values of A CP and A CP | S in these pseudo-experiments are given in table 1, together with the significance with which these signals could be observed in the dataset under study. The table indicates that some types of CPV can be observed more effectively with A CP and others with A CP | S .",
