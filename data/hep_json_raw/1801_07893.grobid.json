The search is interpreted in terms of both a left-handed and a right-handed chiral W ' boson within the mass range 1-5 TeV. Identification of the hadronically decaying top quark is performed using jet substructure tagging techniques based on a shower deconstruction algorithm. No significant deviation from the Standard Model prediction is observed and the results are expressed as upper limits on the W' tb production cross-section times branching ratio as a function of the W'-boson mass. These limits exclude W' bosons with right-handed couplings with masses below 3.0 TeV and W' bosons with left-handed couplings with masses below 2.9 TeV, at the 95% confidence level.",

            "text": "Several theories beyond the Standard Model (SM) involve en hanced symmetries that predict new gauge bosons, usually called W' or Z' bosons. The W' boson is the mediator of a new charged vector current that can be massive enough to decay into a top quark and a b-quark (as in Fig. 1). Many models such as those with extra dimensions [1], strong dynamics [2][3][4][5], composite Higgs [6], or the Little Higgs [7,8] predict new vector charged-current interactions, some with preferential couplings to quarks or thirdgeneration particles [6,[9][10][11][12]. Due to the large mass of the top quark, its interactions decouple from the rest of the phenomenol ogy in many theories beyond the SM. An effective Lagrangian is used to capture the relevant phenomenology of the Sequential Standard Model (SSM) [13] W' tb signal [14,15], which has the same coupling strength to fermions as the SM W boson but higher mass.",

In such a model, the branching ratio for a WR boson decaying into tb is 0(10%) higher relative to that for a W'L boson decaying into tb since a W'L boson can also decay to a lepton and neutrino. Lim its on a SSM left-handed W' boson (WL) decaying into a lepton and a neutrino have been set previously [23,24]. Previous searches in the all-hadronic final state exclude WR bosons with masses up to 2 TeV, set at the 95% confidence level (CL) using 20.3 fb-1 of pp collision data at a centre-of-mass energy (^/s) of 8 TeV [22]. A re cent search by the CMS Collaboration in the lepton+jets final state excludes WR -boson masses up to 3.6 TeV using 35.9 fb-1 of pp collision data collected at /s = 13 TeV [18]. in a top quark and a b-quark that have high transverse momen tum (pt). 2 The decay products of the top quark become more collimated as the top-quark pT increases, and their showers par tially overlap [25]. This high-pT topology is referred to as boosted. The boosted top-quark decay is reconstructed as a single jet. The shower deconstruction (SD) algorithm [26,27] is employed to se lect, or tag, jets from boosted top-quark decays. A signal would be reconstructed as a localised excess in the mtb distribution ris ing above the smoothly falling background originating mostly from jets created by the strong interaction described by quantum chro modynamics (QCD). This analysis represents an improvement on the previous ATLAS analysis in this channel [22] due to a higher centre-of-mass energy, higher integrated luminosity, and better top-tagging techniques, understanding of systematic uncertainties, and statistical treatment.",

The solenoid is surrounded by elec tromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters, and a muon spectrometer incorporating three large superconducting toroid magnet systems.",

For |p| < 2.5, the LAr calorime ters are divided into three layers in depth.

The forward solid angle up to |p| = 4.9 is covered by copper/LAr and tungsten/LAr calorimeter modules, which are opti mised for energy measurements of electrons/photons and hadrons, respectively. The muon spectrometer (MS) comprises separate trig ger and high-precision tracking chambers that measure the deflec tion of muons in a magnetic field generated by superconducting air-core toroids. The ATLAS detector uses a tiered trigger system to select interesting events. The first level is implemented in custom electronics and reduces the event rate from the LHC crossing fre quency of 40 MHz to a design value of 100 kHz. The second level is implemented in software running on a general-purpose processor farm which processes the events and reduces the rate of recorded events to ~1 kHz [30].",

Jets are built from topologically related energy depositions in the calorimeters with the anti-kt algorithm [53] using the FastJet package [54]. Two radius parameters are used for jet reconstruc tion: a small radius (small-R) of 0.4 and a large radius (large-R) of 1.0. The momenta of both the small-R and large-R jets are corrected for energy losses in passive material and for the non compensating response of the calorimeter [55]. Small-R jets are also corrected for the average additional energy due to pile-up in teractions [56]. Energy depositions from pile-up are removed from large-R jets using the trimming algorithm [57]: the constituents of the large-R jet are reclustered using the kt jet algorithm [58, 59] with R = 0.2. Constituent jets contributing less than 5% of the large-R jet's pT are removed. The remaining energy depositions are used to calculate the trimmed-jet kinematics and substructure properties. In order to improve on the angular resolution of the calorimeter, the mass of a large-R jet is computed using a combi nation of calorimeter and tracking information [60].",

Only small-R jets with pT > 25 GeV and |nl < 2.5 (in order to be within the coverage of the ID) are considered in this analysis. Additional pT requirements are applied to enhance the sensitivity of the search (see Section 5). To reduce the number of small-R jets originating from pile-up interactions, a likelihood discriminant, based on track and vertex information, is used to determine whether the primary vertex3 is the origin of the charged-particle tracks associated with a jet candidate and re jects jets originating from pile-up interactions [61]. This is done only for small-R jets with pT < 60 GeV and |nl < 2.4. Small-R jets which originate from b-quarks are identified using a multivari ate b-tagging algorithm [62,63]. Several observables, such as those based on the long lifetime of b-hadrons and the b-to c-hadron de cay topology, are used as algorithm inputs to discriminate between b-jets, c-jets and other jets. The b-tagging requirement correspond ing to an efficiency of 77% to identify b-jets with pT > 20 GeV, as determined from a sample of simulated tt events, is found to be optimal for the statistical significance of this search. This 77% working point (WP) provides rejection factors against lightflavour/gluon jets and c-jets of 134 and 6 respectively [63,64]. Jets identified this way are referred to as b-tagged jets. Since the b-tagging factors are measured in a different pT region, an uncer tainty is assigned to the extrapolation of the measurement to the high pT region of interest.",

In this analysis, an SD-algorithm-based tagger (SD tagger) is used to identify jets originating from the top quark. The SD tagger calculates likelihoods that a given large-R jet origi nates from a hadronic top-quark decay or from a high-momentum light quark or gluon. The constituents of the trimmed large-R jet are used to build exclusive subjets [54], and the four-momenta of these subjets serve as inputs to the SD algorithm. These subjets are used as substitutes for individual quarks and gluons originat ing from the hard scatter. A likelihood weight is calculated for each possible shower history that can lead to the observed subjet con figuration. This step is analogous to running a parton shower MC generator in reverse, where emission and decay probabilities at each vertex, colour connections, and kinematic requirements are considered. For each shower history, the assigned weight is pro portional to the probability that the assumed initial particle gener ates the final configuration, taking into account the SM amplitude for the underlying hard process and the Sudakov form factors for the parton shower. A variable called xSD is defined as the ratio of the sum of the signal-hypothesis weights to the sum of the background-hypothesis weights.

Requirements are imposed on the expected num ber of background events per bin and the bin width is adapted to a resolution function that represents the width of the reconstructed mass peak for each studied W '-boson signal sample. For each mtb bin and in each of the \"b-tag in\" categories, the data sample is di vided into six regions by using top-tagging and b-tagging criteria, which are described in Fig. 3. The \"not loose top-tagged\" regions consist of events where the selected top-quark jet candidate fails to meet the loose top-tagged (80% WP) identification criteria, the \"loose-but-not-tight top-tagged\" regions consist of events where the selected top-quark jet candidate satisfies the loose top-tagged identification criteria but not the tight top-tagged criteria (50% WP) and the \"tight top-tagged\" regions consist of events where the selected top-quark jet candidate satisfies the tight top-tagged criteria. The signal regions are constructed from events in which the selected small-R jet b-candidate is b-tagged: signal region SR1 consists of events classified as \"tight top-tagged, 0 b-tag in\", sig- Table 1 Summary of the top-quark jet candidate and b-quark jet candidate selections before categorisation of events into signal and control regions. The selections are defined in Sections 4 and 5. The events satisfying these criteria are grouped into the categories and regions described in Fig. 3. nal region SR2 consists of events classified as \"loose-but-not-tight top-tagged, 1 b-tag in\" and signal region SR3 consists of events classified as \"tight top-tagged, 1 b-tag in\". A validation region (VR), with negligible signal contamination, is defined to test the perfor mance of the data-driven method of estimating the multi-jet + W / Z +jets background. This region consists of events where the b-candidate is b-tagged, and classified as \"loose-but-not-tight top tagged, 0 b-tag in\". The prediction is found to be in agreement with data within uncertainties. The W'-boson signal selection efficiency, for masses below 2.5 TeV, is higher in SR2 and SR3 than in SR1, due to the require ment of zero b-tagged jets with AR < 1.0 of the large-R jet (\"0 b-tag in\" category) in SR1, making the topology less like the signal in SR1. For masses above 2.5 TeV, the signal efficiency is higher in SR1 than in SR2 and SR3 for the same reason: the b-tagging effi ciency, decreasing with pT, affects SR2 and SR3 more due to the requirement of the additional b-tagged jet. Thus, the addition of the \"0 b-tag in\" category improves the signal sensitivity at large W' -boson masses. The W '-boson signal event selection efficiency is about 10% at low mass, decreasing to about 7% at high mass. The dominant background from multi-jet production is esti mated directly from data using a six-region \"2D sideband\" method that predicts both the shape and normalisation of the mtb distri bution. These regions are shown in Fig. 3.",

The uncertainty in the scale and resolution of large-R jet energy and mass is evaluated by comparing the ra tio of calorimeter-based to track-based measurements in multi-jet data and simulation [25,60]. The flavour-tagging efficiency and its uncertainty for b-jets [62] is estimated in tt events, while the misidentification rate for c-jets and other jets and their corre sponding uncertainties are determined using a ttt-enriched region and multi-jet events, respectively. The SD top-tagging uncertainty is estimated by varying the pT of the subjets used as inputs to the SD algorithm by 2.5%. This value is derived using a procedure described in Ref. [25] and is found to cover any data/simulation differences in the log xSD distribution (see Fig. 2). Systematic un certainties in the lepton veto are found to have a negligible ef fect. Flavour-tagging simulation-to-data efficiency correction factors [62] depend on the jet pT and n. These correction factors have sev eral sources of uncertainty. They are split into uncorrelated compo nents that are then treated independently.

Fig. 4 shows the mtb distributions in the three signal regions and the validation region after the fit to data. The fit in VR is done independently to test the post-fit agreement of the predic tion with data. The maximum value of mtb observed in data is 5.8 TeV. The hatched band in the bottom panel includes the sys tematic uncertainties described in Section 6 after the fit to data. The most discrepant region, at 2.25 TeV, has a local significance of 2.0 a for the combined fit in the three SRs, consistent with the background-only hypothesis. In the absence of any significant excess over the background-only hypothesis, 95% CL limits are de rived on the cross-section times branching ratio of W' to tb decay, as shown in Fig. 5, for the right-handed and left-handed couplings. The observed and expected limits are derived using a linear inter polation between simulated signal mass hypotheses. They translate to observed (expected) lower limits on the mass of a W' boson, with the same coupling to fermions as the SM W boson, of 3.0 (3.0) TeV and 2.9 (2.8) TeV in the rightand left-handed mod els, respectively. These mass limit values are obtained from the intersection of the theory curve and the observed and expected limit curves using a linear interpolation between the 2.75 TeV and 3 TeV W'-boson signal mass points. The narrow dotted curve in Fig. 5 shows the cross-section times branching ratio of W' to tb decay calculated with Ztop [15]. The band around this curve shows the uncertainty in the theoretical cross-section obtained by summing in quadrature the uncertainties in the estimation of the parton distribution function, strong coupling constant, renor malization and factorization scales and the top-quark mass. The difference between the mass exclusion limit results for WRand W'L-boson signals is mainly due to different total cross-sections (a(pp W') \u2022 B(W' tb)) of the two processes as discussed in Section 3.
