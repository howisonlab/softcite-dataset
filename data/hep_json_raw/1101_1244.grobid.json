At the LHC, photons will allow one to confront the data with pQCD predictions at energies never reached before. Since these photons come directly from parton-parton hard scatterings, they allow one to constrain the gluon distribution function in the proton at small parton momentum fraction x = p parton /p proton [2]. Also, photons produced in p-p collisions provide a \"vacuum\" baseline reference for the study of their production rates in nucleus-nucleus collisions. In Pb-Pb collisions, the measurement of direct photons allows one to search for thermal photons emission at 1-5 GeV/c and to study jet-quenching in back-to-back \u03b3-jet correlations.",

            "text": "The measurement of direct photon production is complicated by a large \u03b3 background from hadrons, specially from \u03c0 0 mesons, which decay into two photons. At high p T in p-p collisions, there are between 10 and 100 (at 100 GeV/c and 10 GeV/c, respectively) times more \u03c0 0 than direct \u03b3 and from 2 to 10 times more (depending on the amount of jet quenching) in Pb-Pb collisions. Furthermore, above 10 GeV/c, the two \u03c0 0 decay photons start to merge into a single cluster in the EMCal [3] and thus cannot be identified as a \u03c0 0 via \u03b3-\u03b3 invariant mass analysis. Above 10 GeV/c, the identification method is based on the shape of the shower, which allows to identify photons up to \u223c45 GeV/c in the EMCal. At higher p T , as the two \u03b3 totally overlap, one requires the photons to be isolated from any hadronic activity within a given distance around its direction, to remove the decay photons produced inside jets. The corresponding measurements are then dubbed isolated photons. In ALICE, photons can be measured by two electromagnetic calorimeters, EMCal, a Pb-Sc calorimeter, located at mid-rapidity at -0.7 < \u03b7 < 0.7, which will have a total acceptance of \u2206\u03c6 = 107 0 in azimuth and PHOS (PHOton Spectrometer), a lead tungstate crystal calorimeter, located at mid-rapidity at -0.12 < \u03b7 < 0.12 and covering \u2206\u03c6 = 100 0 . ALICE can also measure photons from their conversion in electron-positron pairs inside the central tracker.",

            "text": "In this work, we will focus on method 4. A standard isolation requirement, in p-p collisions, is that within a cone around the \u03b3 direction defined in pseudo-rapidity \u03b7 and azimuthal angle \u03c6 by R = (\u03b7 \u2212 \u03b7 \u03b3 ) 2 + (\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c6 \u03b3 ) 2 , the accompanying hadronic transverse energy is less than a fixed fraction \u03b5 (e.g. often 10%) of the photon's p T . R is usually taken between 0.4 and 0.7. In Pb-Pb collisions, due to large underlying-event background, we use a simple fixed cut on p T . Isolation enables one to reject a large fraction of the \u03c0 0 decay photons, and access to true isolated photons, prompt photons, produced directly in a hard process via : (i) quark-gluon Compton scattering qg \u2192 \u03b3q, (ii) quark-antiquark annihilation qq \u2192 \u03b3g.  The JETPHOX [4] program (for JET-PHOton/hadron X-sections) allows one to calculate perturbatively the \u03b3 crosssections at Next to Leading Order accuracy. It includes both the fragmentation and the Compton and annihilation components and isolation cuts can be applied at the parton level. Figure 1 left shows the relative contributions of each one of the three direct photon subprocesses in p-p (Compton, annihilation and fragmentation) to direct photon production at LHC (y = 0) as a function of the photon E T . They have been obtained setting all scales to \u00b5 = E T , and using the CTEQ6.6 parton densities and the BFG-II parton-to-photon FFs for the fragmentation photons. The Compton process is dominant above 45 GeV/c, whereas for lower E T , fragmentation photons dominate the spectrum. Figure 1 right shows the subprocesses contributions to the isolated photon cross section. At variance with the inclusive case, we can see that a very significant part of the fragmentation component is suppressed after applying typical isolation cuts (R = 0.4, \u03b5 h = 0.1). The Compton process now clearly dominates the photon yield and accounts for about 3/4 of the isolated production for all E T 's. Although isolation cuts reduce the fragmentation contribution, a fraction of fragmentation photons with z \u2265 1/(1 + \u03b5 h ) survive the cuts. A typical isolation energy cut of \u03b5 h = 0.1, corresponding to 1/(1 + \u03b5 h ) > 0.9, suppresses about 60-80% of fragmentation photons.",

High-z isolated \u03c0 0 are thus considered as the main background in the isolated photons measurement.  cross-section (R = 0.4, \u03b5 = 0.1) obtained for two different PYTHIA [5] tunes : Perugia hard and soft [6], which have different hardness for the parton-to-\u03c0 0 fragmentation. The expected isolated \u03c0 0 spectrum has systematic uncertainties of up to 70%, depending on the \u03c0 0 FF used (Figure 2 right).  After obtaining the isolated photon and \u03c0 0 cross-section with PYTHIA, the signal over background (S/B) ratio is now studied. Figure 3 left shows the S/B in the inclusive case, and right the S/B with isolation cuts applied (R = 0.4, \u03b5 = 0.1), for hard and soft FF tunes, for p-p collisions at \u221a s = 14 TeV. The S/B stays smaller than 1 over the whole p T range. After applying isolation cuts, the S/B becomes greater than the unit at around 30 GeV/c. Isolation allows one to enhance significantly the S/B ratio, up to a factor 20 at 100 GeV/c.",
