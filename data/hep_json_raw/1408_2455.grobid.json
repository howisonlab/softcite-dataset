While several experiments searching for such a rare decay have been performed in the past, a new generation of experiments using different isotopes and techniques have recently released their results or are taking data and will provide new limits, should no signal be observed, in the next few years to come. The present contribution reviews the latest public results on double beta decay searches and gives an overview on the expected sensitivities of the experiments in construction which will be able to set stronger limits in the near future.",

            "text": "Double beta decay is the simultaneous beta decay of two neutrons in a nucleus. The reaction can be calculated in the standard model of particle physics as a second order process: (A, Z) \u2192 (A, Z + 2) + 2e \u2212 + 2\u03bd e . The two neutrino double beta decay (2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2) has been observed in eleven nuclei, where single beta decay is energetically forbidden, and very high half-lives, between 7 \u00d7 10 18 yr and 2 \u00d7 10 24 yr have been measured [1,2]. Several models extending the standard model predict that a neutrinoless double beta decay (0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2) should also exists: (A, Z) \u2192 (A, Z + 2) + 2e \u2212 . It's observation would imply that lepton number is violated by two unit and that neutrinos have a Majorana mass component. The standard mechanism for 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 assumes that the process is mediated by light and massive Majorana neutrinos and that other mechanisms potentially leading to neutrinoless double beta decay are negligible [3]. With a light Majorana neutrino exchange, it would be possible to derive an effective neutrino mass using nuclear matrix element and phase space factor predictions. For recent reviews on the subject, see Ref. [4], [5]. Several experiments searching for neutrinoless double beta decay have been performed in the past, going back for at least half a century, with increasing sensitivities. Two main approaches have been followed. Indirect methods are based on the measurements of anomalous concentrations of the daughter nuclei in selected samples after very long exposures (i.e. radiochemical methods). Direct methods, on the other hand, try to measure in real time the properties of the two electrons emitted in \u03b2\u03b2 decay. The detectors can be homogeneous, when the \u03b2\u03b2 source is the detector medium and in-homogeneous when external \u03b2\u03b2 sources are inserted in the detector.",

The experiment is built around a large liquid Xenon Time Projection Chamber filled with about 200 kg of liquid Xenon enriched to about 80.6% in the 136 Xe isotope. In contrast to standard TPCs, the experiment uses liquid xenon which can be concentrated in a smaller volume with the same mass concentration. To overcome the limitation of worse energy resolutions compared to gaseous TPCs, the experiment exploits the readout of both scintillation and ionization signals produced by interacting particles in xenon. Moreover, by combining both signals (scintillation light and ionization charges), the experiment is able to reject background events characterized by different charge to light collection ratio. Finally, by using the difference in the arrival time between the scintillation and ionization signals a z-coordinate of the event is reconstructed. The experiment started data taking in May 2011.",

The germanium detectors are suspended in strings into the cryostat where 64 m 3 of LAr are used both as a coolant and shield. The stainless steel cryostat vessel is covered, from the inside, with copper lining to reduce gamma radiation from the cryostat walls. The vessel is surrounded by a large tank filled with high purity water (590 m 3 ) which further shields the inner volumes from the experimental hall radiation (absorbing \u03b3s and moderating neutrons).

Data were grouped into three subsets with similar characteristics: (1) the golden data set contains the major part of the data from coaxial detectors, (2) two short run periods with higher background levels when the BEGe detector were inserted (silver data set) and (3) the BEGe detectors data set. Figure. 2 shows the energy spectrum around the region of interest with and without PSD selection. No excess of events was observed over a flat background distribution. Seven events were seen in the range Q \u03b2\u03b2 \u00b1 5 keV before PSD cuts, while 5.1 were expected. Only 3 events survived (classified as Single-Site Events [25]) after PSD cuts and no event remained in Q \u03b2\u03b2 \u00b1\u03c3 E . To derive the number of signal counts N 0\u03bd , a profile likelihood fit of the spectrum was performed. The fit function was given by the sum of a constant term for the background and of a Gaussian for the signal events. The profile likelihood ratio was limited to the region 1/T 0\u03bd 1/2 > 0. The best fit was obtained for N 0\u03bd = 0, that is no excess of signal events above background.

The proposal is to mount HPGe diodes inside ultra clean electro-formed copper vacuum cryostats and place the whole apparatus in a very deep underground laboratory. Presently, the MAJORANA collaboration is building a prototype, the MAJORANA demonstrator [27] (MJD), to prove the feasibility of the experiment and measure the background conditions. The MJD will be constructed and operated in the Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF) at a depth of 1500 m in South Dakota, USA. The MJD will use about 40 kg of germanium diodes (with about 30 kg of enriched germanium diodes) and, with performances comparable to those of GERDA, is expected to start data taking in 2014. Depending on the results of GERDA Phase II and the MAJORANA demonstrator, a next generation germanium experiment using of the order of 1 ton of enriched germanium diodes is under discussion. The effort could be built in stages, starting to merge the GERDA Phase II and MAJORANA diodes in a common effort environment while constructing new diodes from enriched material to enlarge the detector active mass.",

Each crystal is a cube with a side of 5 cm and a mass of 750 g. The small temperature rise originating from nuclear decays in the crystals are read using Neutron Transmutation Doped (NTD) Ge termistors. The array will be operated at about 10 mK in a custom He 3 /He 4 dilution refrigerator. The experiment will be located at LNGS in the same experimental hall of the GERDA experiment. The technology has been successfully validated with the Cuoricino [29] experiment. The first installed CUORE tower, CUORE0 has been configured as a stand-alone experiment and is currently taking data to study the background rates and sensitivities expected for CUORE. Recent results from CUORE0 [30] show a good energy resolution of 5.2 keV FWHM at the 228 Tl line (2615 keV) and a background counting rate of 0.063 \u00b1 0.006 cts/(keV\u2022kg\u2022yr) [30].

Several large mass, high sensitivity, experiments will be running in the next few years and they will provide important results on 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2. In case of a positive signal, an observation with several isotopes is needed for convincing evidence. The results would imply that neutrino follow an inverted hierarchy * mass scheme and allow to directly measure the neutrino mass scale. Even a missing observation of 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 on all the isotopes under investigation would play an important role and the results would have to be combined with those coming from future neutrino oscillation experiments (reactors and long baseline).",
