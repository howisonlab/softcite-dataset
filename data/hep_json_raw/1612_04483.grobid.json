Z-chamber, both also used for a trigger, and both inside a thin (0.2 X 0 ) superconducting solenoid with a field of 1.3 T. The electromagnetic calorimeter (EMC) includes three systems. The liquid xenon (LXe) barrel calorimeter with a thickness of 5.4 X 0 has a fine electrode structure, providing 1-2 mm spatial resolution [12], and shares the cryostat vacuum volume with the superconducting solenoid. The barrel CsI crystal calorimeter with a thickness of 8.1 X 0 is placed outside the LXe calorimeter, and the endcap BGO calorimeter with a thickness of 13.4 X 0 is installed inside the solenoid [13]. The luminosity is measured using events of Bhabha scattering at large angles [14] with about 1% accuracy. The c.m. energy has been monitored by using the Back-Scattering-Laser-Light system [15] with about 0.06 MeV systematic uncertainty. To obtain a detection efficiency, we have developed Monte Carlo (MC) simulation of our detector based on the GEANT4 [16] package, in which the interaction of generated particles with the detector and its response are implemented. MC simulation includes softphoton radiation by the electron or positron, calculated according to Ref. [17].",

Charged kaons are efficiently suppressed by the ionization losses in the DC. To suppress neutral kaons, we remove events with invariant mass of any two pion candidates within 20 MeV from the K 0 mass and having total momentum inside the 20 MeV/c window of the expected kaon momentum for the e + e \u2212 \u2192 K 0 S K 0 L reaction. To reduce the background from the reaction e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 , we require a missing mass for any two pion candidates to be greater than two pion masses. After this requirement the remaining contribution from three pions to the number of four-track candidates is less than 0.3%. For four-or three-track candidates we calculate the total energy and total momentum assuming all tracks to be pions: pion events is seen as a cluster of dots near zero. Events with a radiative photon have non-zero total momentum and total energy which is always smaller than the nominal one. A momentum of any pion incorrectly reconstructed due to the interaction with the detector material or DC resolution leads to momentum-energy correlated \"tails\" in both directions.",

The dynamics of the process e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 has been relatively well studied in previous experiments [4,3], and the a 1 (1260) \u00b1 \u03c0 \u2213 final state has been shown to dominate. Our energy range is well below the nominal threshold of this reaction, and with our data sample we cannot observe any difference in any distribution for other final states, like \u03c1(770) f 0 (500) or phase-space production of four pions.  Fig. 3(b) presents the polar angle distribution for three detected tracks (circles for data, the solid histogram for the MC simulation) after background subtraction. The polar angle distribution for the missing track is shown by squares (data) and the dashed histogram (MC). With our DC acceptance we have about the same number of four-pion events with one missing track compared to events with all tracks detected. Fig. 4(a) shows a ratio of the number of three-track events, N 3trDC , with a missing track inside a DC acceptance (0.7 < \u03b8 \u03c0 < 2.44 radians) to the number of four-track events, N 4tr , for data (circles) and MC-simulation (a dashed line at 0.215). This ratio for data exhibits very small variation with energy, but the average value of 0.274 \u00b1 0.012 differs from that for the MC-simulation. Based on these numbers we conclude that our MC-simulation overestimates a track reconstruction efficiency: 0.951 vs 0.936 \u00b1 0.004 in data. This difference does not depend on the primary generator model. We add events with a missing track inside the DC acceptance volume to a four-track sample, and this sum, N 4tr + N 3trDC , corresponds to about 98% of events with all four pions inside the DC acceptance: a probability to detect only one or two tracks from four is very low. A correction for the data-MC difference, 1 corr , is about 1%, and we assign a 1% systematic uncertainty to this value.",
