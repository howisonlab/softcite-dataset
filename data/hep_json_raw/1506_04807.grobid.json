In this region of phase space the K 0 S K 0 S system is dominantly produced through the f0(980).

            "text": "The non-Abelian property of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) permits the existence of bound states beyond conventional mesons and baryons, such as glueballs, hybrid states and multiquark states. The search for these unconventional states is one of the main interests in experimental particle physics. One of the most promising candidates, the X(1835) resonance, was first observed in its decay to \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b7 \u2032 in the process J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b7 \u2032 by BESII [1]; this observation was subsequently confirmed by BESIII [2]. The discovery of the X(1835) has stimulated theoretical speculation concerning its nature. Possible interpretations include a pp bound state [3], a second radial excitation of the \u03b7 \u2032 [4], and a pseudo-scalar glueball [5]. In addition, an enhancement in the invariant pp mass at threshold, X(pp), was first observed by BESII in the decay J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3pp [6], and was later also seen by BESIII [7] and CLEO [8]. In a partial-wave analysis of J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3pp, BESIII determined the J P C of the X(pp) to be 0 \u2212+ [9]. The mass of the X(pp) is consistent with the X(1835) mass measured in J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b7 \u2032 [2], but the width of the X(pp) is significantly narrower.",

            "text": "In this letter, only spins J < 3 and possible S-wave or P -wave decays of the X are considered. The amplitudes are constructed using the covariant tensor formalism described in Ref. [16]. The relative magnitudes and phases of the partial wave amplitudes are determined by an unbinned maximum likelihood fit to data. The contribution of non-\u03b7 background events is accounted for in the fit by subtracting the negative log-likelihood (NLL) value obtained for events in the \u03b7 sideband region from the NLL value obtained for events in the \u03b7 signal region. The statistical significance of a contribution is estimated by the difference in NLL with and without the particular contribution, taking the change in degrees of freedom into account. Our initial PWA fits include an X(1835) resonance in the f 0 (980)\u03b7 channel and a non-resonant component in one of the possible decay channels f 0 (980)\u03b7, f 0 (1500)\u03b7 or f 2 (1525)\u03b7. All possible J P C combinations of the X(1835) and the non-resonant component are tried. We then extend the fits by including an additional resonance at lower K 0 S K 0 S \u03b7 mass. This additional component, denoted here as the X(1560), improves the fit quality when it is allowed to interfere with the X(1835). Our final fits show that the data can be best described with three components: X(1835) \u2192 f 0 (980)\u03b7, X(1560) \u2192 f 0 (980)\u03b7 and a non-resonant f 0 (1500)\u03b7 component. The J P C of the X(1835), the X(1560) and the non-resonant component are all found to be 0 \u2212+ . The X(1835), X(1560) and f 0 (1500) are described by non-relativistic Breit-Wigner functions, where the intrinsic widths are not energy dependent. The masses and widths of the X(1835) and X(1560) are derived by scanning each over a certain range. The f 0 (1500) mass and width are fixed to the values reported in Ref. [17]. The f 0 (980) is parameterized by the Flatt\u00e9 formula [18], with the parameters fixed to the values reported by BESII [19] in the channels J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c6\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c6K + K \u2212 . The scan returns a mass and width of the X(1835) of 1844 \u00b1 9 MeV/c 2 and 192 +20 \u221217 MeV, respectively. The mass and width of the X(1560) are determined to be 1565 \u00b1 8 MeV/c 2 and 45 +14 \u221213 MeV, respectively. Using a detection efficiency of 5.5%, obtained by a MC sample weighted by partial wave amplitudes, the product branching fraction of J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3X(1835) and X(1835) \u2192 K 0 S K 0 S \u03b7 (B X(1835) ) is calculated to be (3.31 +0.33 \u22120.30 ) \u00d7 10 \u22125 , where the decay X(1835) \u2192 K 0 S K 0 S \u03b7 is dominated by f 0 (980) production. The K 0 S K 0 S \u03b7, K 0 S K 0 S , K 0 S \u03b7 mass spectra and the distributions of the J/\u03c8, K 0 S K 0 S \u03b7 and K 0 S K 0 S decay angles are shown in Fig. 2. Overlaid on the data are the PWA fit projections, as well as the individual contributions from each component. The \u03c7 2 /n bin value is displayed on each figure to demonstrate the goodness of fit. We evaluate the significance by applying the likelihood ratio test, performing a separate fit for every systematic variation detailed below. The most conservative statistical significances of the X(1835) and X(1560) are 12.9\u03c3 and 8.9\u03c3, respectively.",

The NLL value of a fit with a 1 ++ non-resonant f 0 (1500)\u03b7 component is only worse by 0.8 compared to the nominal solution, which indicates that we cannot distinguish between the two spin assignments of the non-resonant component with our present statistics. This ambiguity introduces large systematic uncertainties in the B X(1835) , since the interference between the X(1835), X(1560) and the nonresonant component depends on the spin-assignment of the latter. To establish the J P C of the X(1835), we perform a series of PWA fits assuming alternative J P C hypotheses for both the X(1835) and the non-resonant contribution. For the non-resonant contribution, we also test several possible decay channels (f 0 (980)\u03b7, f 0 (1500)\u03b7 and f 2 (1525)\u03b7) in turn. For each non-resonant component assumption, the X(1835) 0 \u2212+ hypothesis is significantly better than the 1 ++ or 2 \u2212+ hypotheses, with the NLL value improving by at least 41.6 units. Analogously, we perform the same series of PWA fits for the X(1560). Again the 0 \u2212+ hypothesis for the X(1560) always yields a significantly better fit result than other J P C assignments, with the NLL value improving by at least 12.8 units.",

Additional non-resonant contributions with various J P C and decay modes are studied as well. The statistical significances of the additional contributions are smaller than 5\u03c3. In order to check the possible contribution from a non-resonant K 0 S K 0 S process, we add a X(1835) \u2192 (K 0 S K 0 S ) S \u03b7 process into the nominal solution, where (K 0 S K 0 S ) S refers to a non-resonant K 0 S K 0 S contribution in a relative S-wave.

We also test a fit by changing the decay mode of the X(1560) in the nominal solution from f 0 (980)\u03b7 to (K 0 S K 0 S ) S \u03b7; the fit with X(1560) \u2192 (K 0 S K 0 S ) S \u03b7 has almost the same fit quality as the nominal solution. Therefore, with the present statistics, we cannot draw a conclusion about the X(1560) decay mode. The largest differences in masses and widths of the X(1835) and X(1560) and the product branching fraction B X(1835) between all above alternative fits and the nominal solution are taken as systematic uncertainties from the components in the nominal solution.",

For the systematic errors of the product branching fraction B X(1835) , we also consider the following additional uncertainties. The K 0 S reconstruction efficiency is studied using two control samples of J/\u03c8 \u2192 K * \u00b1 K \u2213 and J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c6K 0 S K \u00b1 \u03c0 \u2213 , while the photon detection efficiency is investigated based on a clean sample of J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c1\u03c0.

A control sample of J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3K 0 S K 0 S \u03c0 0 is selected to estimate the uncertainty associated with the 4C kinematic fit. The efficiency is the ratio of the signal yields with and without the kinematic fit requirement \u03c7 2 4C < 40. The difference between data and MC, 1.5%, is assigned as the systematic uncertainty. We also consider the uncertainties from the number of J/\u03c8 events [10,11] and the branching fractions of K 0 S \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and \u03b7 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 [17]. We change the mass and width of X(1835) or X(1560) by one standard deviation of the statistical uncertainty.

Present statistics do not allow us to conclusively determine if the X(1560) is the same state as the \u03b7(1405)/\u03b7(1475) or a new meson. More statistics in this analysis and an amplitude analysis of J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7\u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 and J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3K 0 S K 0 S \u03c0 0 processes may help to understand the nature of the X(1560).",
