Unlike other neutrino sources, they provide an unprecedented level of control of the flavor at source, flux and energy, which has been prominent in confirming the very existence of neutrino oscillations and measuring with high precision the oscillation parameters. Accelerator neutrino beams [1] are mostly sources of \u03bd \u00b5 beams because the vast majority of neutrinos produced at accelerators originate by the decay in flight of multi-GeV pions. As a consequence, they play a role in neutrino oscillation physics only if the oscillation length L o is within the earth diameter for the neutrino energy range E accessible to accelerators (0.1-100 GeV). The existence of at least one oscillation length smaller than the earth diameter and involving \u03bd \u00b5 in the GeV-energy range has been established by Super-Kamiokande in 1998 [2,3]. In the modern formalism that describes neutrino oscillation (see Section 2), it corresponds to saying that both the mixing angle between the second and third neutrino mass eigenstates (\u03b8 23 ) and their squared mass difference (\u2206m 2 23 \u2261 m 2 3 \u2212 m 3 2 ) are different from zero. Such statement opened up the modern field of neutrino oscillations at accelerators. Since \u2206m 2 23 2.3 \u00d7 10 \u22123 eV 2 and the oscillation length is:",

It is fortunate that oscillations are visible at propagation lengths smaller than the earth diameter because both the source and the detector can be artificial, i.e., designed by the experimentalist to maximise sensitivity and precision. On the other hand, it is unfortunate that the baselines of interest are hundreds of km long (\"long-baseline experiments\"): since neutrinos cannot be directly focused, the divergence of the \u03bd beam is large and the transverse size of the flux at the detector is much larger than the size of the detector itself. As a consequence, the number of neutrinos crossing the detector decreases as L \u22122 and such a drop must be compensated by brute force, increasing the number of neutrinos at source.

In 2012 reactor (Daya-Bay [4], RENO [5]) and accelerator (T2K [6]), experiments demonstrated that even the mixing angle between the first and third neutrino mass eigenstate is non-zero. Indeed, \u03b8 13 is quite large (\u03b8 13 8 \u2022 ) so that the entire neutrino mixing matrix (PMNS-see Section 2) has a very different structure compared with the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix. This result corroborates once more the fact that the Yukawa sector of the Standard Model is far from being understood both in the quark and lepton sector. From the experimental point of view, a large \u03b8 13 opens up the possibility of observing simultaneously \u03bd \u00b5 \u2192 \u03bd \u03c4 and \u03bd \u00b5 \u2192 \u03bd e oscillations in long baseline experiments and, in general, three family interference effects. This is the reason why neutrino physicists refer to the current and future generation of beam experiments as the experiments for the \"precision era\" of neutrino physics. These modern experiments must disentangle the missing parameters of the Standard Model (SM) Lagrangian in the neutrino sector (the CP violating phase, the ordering of the mass eigenstates) from small perturbations in the \u03bd \u00b5 oscillation probability at the GeV scale. Since the baselines of these experiments range from 295 km (T2K) to 1300 km (DUNE), beam intensity and statistics still play an important role. However, systematics will soon become the limiting factor for precision neutrino physics, especially in the DUNE and Hyper-Kamiokande era.",

The discovery of neutrino oscillations falsified the SM in its original formulation although the theory can be minimally extended to account for massive neutral leptons. In the minimally extended SM [7], massive neutral leptons are treated as (massive) quarks: their flavor eigenstates are linear combination of mass eigenstates and the linear operator that mixes the flavor and mass eigenfunctions is a 3 \u00d7 3 complex matrix. In the quark sector, this matrix is called the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix. The corresponding matrix in the lepton sector is the Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata (PMNS) matrix U \u03b1,i .

Note that, in the (minimally extended) SM, only fields with LH chirality (\u03bd L ) appear in the charged currents (CC) that describe the coupling of fermions with the W \u00b1 bosons. In the original SM, \u03bd L describe neutrinos with LH chirality that can be observed as particles with LH helicity. In the minimally extended SM, neutrinos are massive and therefore neutrinos with LH chirality may be observed with both spin antiparallel (LH helicity) and parallel (RH helicity) to the direction of motion. Direct mass measurements and oscillation data, however, suggest m i m e by at least five order of magnitudes. As a consequence, for any practical purpose, the helicity of a LH chirality field can be considered LH, as well. The neutrinos fields in the SM are Dirac fields, as for the case of quarks. The anti-neutrino fields describe particles that are different from the neutrinos (\"anti-neutrinos\") and only RH anti-neutrinos couple with the W bosons in CC currents. Unlike quarks, where particles are electrically charged and must be different from antiparticles of opposite electric charge, neutrinos are neutral particles and the anti-particle fields may be the same as for the particles. In this case, the neutrino fields are Majorana fields and not Dirac fields. This subtlety is immaterial for massless neutrinos because the RH neutrino field can be identified with the RH anti-neutrino field without changing the value of any observable. In the extended SM, there are observables that are sensitive to whether the neutrino are standard Dirac particles or \"Majorana particles\" (i.e., elementary fermions that are described by Majorana fields), although the correspondent measurements are extremely challenging due to the smallness of m i . The minimally extended SM Lagrangian is built applying the quark formalism to neutrinos and, hence, in this model neutrinos are Dirac particles. In this case, as for the CKM, the PMNS matrix is unitary (U \u2020 U = 1) and can be parameterized [3] by three angles and one complex phase. The parameterization that has been adopted for the PMNS put the complex phase in the 1-3 sector, i.e., in the rotation matrix between the first and third mass eigenstate: ",

For antineutrino oscillations, U must be replaced by U * in Equation (3), which corresponds to changing the sign of the third term. As a consequence, oscillation experiments can reconstruct all rotation angles and the CP phase. They also can measure the squared mass differences among eigenstates although the absolute mass scale must be measured in an independent manner. Note in particular that CP violation in the leptonic sector can be established just measuring the difference between P(\u03bd \u03b1 \u2192 \u03bd \u03b2 ) and P(\u03bd \u03b1 \u2192\u03bd \u03b2 ) if \u03b1 = \u03b2.

In fact, the sign of \u2206m 2 12 has been determined at the beginning of the century by solar neutrino experiments. The oscillation probabilities here are strongly perturbed by matter effects in the sun, which are sensitive to the sign of \u2206m 2 12 . As discussed in Section 5, matter effects on the earth are employed by long-baseline experiments to determine the sign of \u2206m 2 23 , which is not fully established yet. The choice of Dirac fields for the description of neutrinos in the minimally extended SM is the simplest from the technical point of view, but it is very disputable in the light of the gauge principle [8]. The most general Lagrangian compatible with the SU(2) \u2297 U(1) gauge symmetry and containing all SM particles (including massive neutrinos) allows for \"Majorana mass terms\" as \u2212 1 2 m i \u03bd T iL C\u03bd iL + h.c., where C is the charge conjugation matrix. It is possible to show that these terms imply neutrinos to be Majorana particles and must be removed by hand from the minimally extended SM based on Dirac fields. A vast class of SM extensions is motivated by the existence of Majorana particles. Several of these models are also able to explain the smallness of neutrino masses through the \"see-saw mechanism\" [9][10][11][12][13]. Neutrino oscillations, however, cannot address these kind of issues.

At that time, \u03b8 13 was not known and only upper limits from the Chooz reactor experiment [15] were available (\u03b8 13 < 12 \u2022 ). In those years, there was no evidence of oscillations in appearance mode, i.e., no measurements testifying non-zero values of P(\u03bd \u03b1 \u2192 \u03bd \u03b2 ) for any \u03b1 = \u03b2. Such evidence was still lacking in 2002, when solar and reactor experiments employing \u03bd e and \u03bd e whose energy was well below the kinematic threshold for the production of muons, demonstrated that \u03b8 12 35 \u2022 and \u2206m 2 12 7 \u00d7 10 \u22125 eV 2 . In order to observe in a neutrino detector the appearance of new flavors (\u03b1 = \u03b2), the energy of the neutrino must be well above the kinematic threshold for the production of the lepton of flavor \u03b2. For solar and reactor neutrinos, this is not possible since the energies of their \u03bd e and \u03bd e are much smaller than m \u00b5 . Atmospheric neutrinos, on the other hand, may be the right natural source since their energy spectrum extends well above the \u00b5 and even the \u03c4 kinematic threshold. At that time, there was no evidence of \u03bd \u00b5 \u2192 \u03bd e oscillations at the atmospheric energy scale and, therefore, the disappearance of \u03bd \u00b5 was ascribed to \u03bd \u00b5 \u2192 \u03bd \u03c4 oscillations. The CERN-to-Gran Sasso (CNGS) [16,17] neutrino beam was designed to provide evidence of \u03bd \u00b5 \u2192 \u03bd \u03c4 oscillations in appearance mode, i.e., observing explicitly the appearance of \u03bd \u03c4 by detecting \u03c4 leptons produced by CC events in the detector. The CNGS beam exploited the Gran Sasso laboratories (LNGS), an existing underground laboratory located 730 km from CERN. This constraint fixed the baseline of the CNGS experiments: OPERA and ICARUS. The CNGS has been the only long-baseline beam whose energy (E 17 GeV) was well above the kinematic threshold for the production of the tau lepton (3.5 GeV for CC scattering in nuclei). The energy was tuned maximizing the number of observable \u03bd \u03c4 CC events:",

            "text": "From the analysis point of view, OPERA is a rare event search experiment since just a handful of fully reconstructed tau events are expected from Equation (6). The tau events in OPERA are reconstructed as events with a primary track that shows a kink with respect to the initial direction. The kink testifies the decay in flight of the tau lepton in the lead of the ECC. In particular, OPERA has been seeking for tau leptons in most of its high branching ratio decay modes: \u03c4 \u2192 \u00b5 (i.e., \u03c4 \u2192 \u00b5\u03bd \u00b5 \u03bd \u03c4 with a visible muon from the primary vertex), \u03c4 \u2192 e, \u03c4 \u2192 h (\"one prong\", i.e., hadronic decay with only one visible charged hadron) and \"three prongs\" (i.e., hadronic decay with three visible charged hadrons). Rare event searches are plagued by potential biases due to the tuning of the selection procedure in the course of data taking. In order to minimize bias, the OPERA Collaboration followed two approaches. The most conservative one was implemented during data taking and the initial stage of data analysis, bringing to a 5\u03c3 discovery of tau appearance in 2015. Here, tau leptons were selected using topological and kinematic cuts defined a priori in the design phase of the experiment. The efficiency of these cuts were evaluated by a full simulation of OPERA performed with GENIE [21] (neutrino interactions), NEGN [22] (kinematic properties of final states) and GEANT4 [23] (detector response). The simulation was validated with a control sample based on \u03bd \u00b5 CC events producing charmed particles in the final state. The 2015 analysis [24] is based on 5 \u03bd \u03c4 CC candidates whose background is summarized in Table 2. The events observed in OPERA for the standard 2015 analysis are consistent with the \"three flavor neutrino oscillation paradigm\", i.e., the minimally extended SM accounting for neutrino oscillations. In particular, given the superior background rejection capability of the ECC based analysis, \u03bd \u03c4 appearance was established with a statistical significance of 5.1 \u03c3 with just five candidates (see Figure 2). For that particular analysis, the probability of detecting five events or more is 6.4%. In 2018, OPERA developed a more sophisticated analysis reaping on the improvement in the knowledge of the detector response and background subtraction techniques accumulated during data taking. The final OPERA analysis is based on looser kinematic cuts applied to four variables: the distance between the decay vertex and the downstream face of the lead plate containing the primary vertex (z dec ), the momentum (p) and transverse momentum (p T ) of the secondary particle and the 3D angle \u03b8 kink between the parent particle and its daughters. The cuts are independent of the tau decay mode (z dec < 2.6 mm, \u03b8 kink > 0.02 rad, p > 1 GeV) except for the transverse momentum (p T > 0.15 GeV for \u03c4 \u2192 h and p T > 0.1 GeV for \u03c4 \u2192 e or \u00b5). In addition, p < 15 GeV is requested for the tau decay into muon to suppress the high energy tail of \u03bd \u00b5 CC events of the CNGS. After these cuts, a multivariate statistical approach is employed to separate signal from background and to produce a single-variable discriminant for the oscillation hypothesis test and parameters estimation. In this analysis, 10 observed events were selected. The expectation in the minimally extended SM was 6.8 \u00b1 0.75 events plus a background of 2.0 \u00b1 0.4 events. This analysis, which represents the final result of OPERA on search for \u03bd \u00b5 \u2192 \u03bd \u03c4 appearance, establishes oscillations at 6.1 \u03c3 confidence level [25].",

            "text": "The CNGS served for several years also the ICARUS experiment [26] that took data at LNGS from 2010 to 2012. ICARUS was a 600 ton liquid Argon TPC (see Figure 3) composed of a large cryostat divided into two identical, adjacent half-modules, each one with internal dimensions of 3.6 m (width) \u00d7 3.9 m (height) \u00d7 19.6 m (length). The inner detector structure of each submodule (300 ton) consisted of two TPCs separated by a common cathode. Each TPC is made of three parallel wire planes, 3 mm apart and the relative angles between the two wire planes is 60 \u2022 . The distance between the wires is 3 mm (wire pitch). These wire planes constitute the anode of the TPC. The TPC volume is filled with high purity liquid Argon and the electrons produced by the charged particles drift toward the anode wires. A uniform electric field perpendicular to the wires drives the electrons in the LAr volume of each half-module by means of a HV system. The cathode plane, parallel to the wire planes, is placed in the center of the LAr volume of each half-module at a distance of about 1.5 m from the wires of each side. This distance defines the maximum drift path. Between the cathode and the anode, field-shaping electrodes are installed to guarantee the uniformity of the field along the drift direction. At the nominal voltage of 75 kV, corresponding to an electric field of 500 V/cm, the maximum drift time in LAr is about 1 ms. As a consequence, the purity of the liquid Argon must be such that the electron lifetime is comparable with the drift time, i.e., that electrons can drift in the active volume before recombining with electronegative impurities. Such a long drift length requires Argon purity < 0.01 part-per-billion (ppb). The space resolution that can be achieved in ICARUS is much worse than the ECC (1 mm versus a few microns), but this detector technology can be readout as a standard TPC and the observation and selection of CC events can be performed in real time. In addition, this technology is scalable to masses that are unpractical for the ECC ( 1 kton). In fact, the mass of the TPC operated at LNGS-the largest LArTPC ever built-was still smaller than what was needed for the observation of \u03bd \u03c4 CC events on a kinematical basis. Still, ICARUS achieved important results in the study of \u03bd \u00b5 \u2192 \u03bd e oscillations beyond the minimally extended SM (limits to sterile neutrino oscillations) [28] and in the clarification of the neutrino velocity anomaly reported in 2011 by OPERA [29]. Even more, the successful operation of ICARUS in a deep underground laboratory at the 600 t scale, opened up the possibility of building multi-kton detectors based on the LArTPC technology, paving the way to the design and construction of ProtoDUNE-SP and DUNE (see Section 6). At the end of the ICARUS data taking at LNGS, the Argon recirculation and purification systems reached a free electron lifetime exceeding 15 ms, corresponding to about 20 parts per trillion of O 2 -equivalent contamination [30].",

The Cherenkov light emitted in water by charged particles above a momentum threshold allows for measure with great precision the momentum, the direction and the vertex of the leptons produced by neutrino interactions. The different topologies of the muon and electron tracks produce different patterns of hit phototubes; in this way, electron and muons are identified with great precision by SK. The quasi-elastic topology, where a single lepton is produced, is particularly favorable for the characteristics of the SK detector.",

Six events passed all the selection criteria in SK, with an expected background of 1.5 \u00b1 0.3 events, corresponding to a significance of about 2.5\u03c3.

Eventually, the \u03b8 13 determination by reactor experiments achieved a much better precision than T2K and today the global best-fit to \u03b8 13 is [3] sin 2 \u03b8 13 = 0.0215 with a 3\u03c3 allowed range of 0.0190-0.0240. The precise, unambiguous determination of \u03b8 13 by reactors greatly improved the sensitivity of long baseline experiments to \u03b4 CP and neutrino mass ordering. This is nicely illustrated in Figure 4, where the confidence regions measured by T2K without any input from reactor experiments are compared with the confidence region from reactors [46], indicating how better \u03b4 CP is constrained after the inclusion of reactor data.  The most recent T2K published results are based on SK data collected between 2009 and 2017 in (anti)neutrino mode with a neutrino beam exposure of 14.7 \u00d7 10 20 (7.6 \u00d7 10 20 ) protons on target [46].",

The Near Detector is placed in the proximity of NUMI at a distance of 1 km from the production target and is located 100 m underground. It is a 290 t liquid scintillator detector that measures 3.8 m \u00d7 3.8 m \u00d7 12.8 m and is followed by a muon range stack. The 14 kton far detector (see Figure 5) is the largest neutrino detector ever operated on surface and measures 15 m \u00d7 15 m \u00d7 60 m. Both detectors use liquid scintillator contained in PVC cells that are 6.6 cm \u00d7 3.9 cm (0.15 radiation lengths per cell) in cross-section and span the height and width of the detectors in planes of alternating vertical and horizontal orientation. The light is read out by wavelength-shifting fibers connected to APDs. Operation at surface, with practically no overburden (three meters of water equivalent, 130 kHz of cosmic-ray activity) is possible thanks to the short duration of the proton burst that allows for exploiting the time correlation between the events observed in the detector and the occurrence of the proton extraction to the target in NUMI. The analysis [65] is built upon the set of all APD signals above threshold around the 10\u00b5s beam spill. The cosmic ray background is directly measured by a dedicated dataset recorded in the 420 \u00b5s surrounding the beam spill. This control sample is employed for calibration, study of stability response, and for the training of the event reconstruction algorithms. NO\u03bdA was designed to search for non-null values of \u03b8 13 and measure the leading oscillation parameters at the atmospheric scale (\u2206m 2 23 , \u03b8 23 ). Even if the discovery of \u03b8 13 has been achieved by Daya Bay, Double-Chooz, RENO and T2K well before the start of the NOVA data taking, the physics reach of this experiment has been significantly boosted by the large value of this angle. NOVA is the only long baseline experiment currently exploiting matter effects to determine the neutrino mass pattern. As mentioned in Section 2, the presence of a dense medium can perturb the oscillation probability of neutrinos because matter is rich in electrons and deprived of muons and tau leptons. As a consequence, the evolution of the flavor wavefunction is perturbed by the fact that \u03bd \u00b5 and \u03bd \u03c4 can interact only by neutral currents (NC) with the electrons of matter while both NC and CC elastic scattering can occur for \u03bd e . Elastic weak scattering can occur also in the nuclei, but, in this case, the \u03bd e have the same interaction probabilities as for \u03bd \u00b5 or \u03bd \u03c4 . The matter perturbations thus are only due to the density of the electrons in the medium and are parameterized by an effective potential V = \u221a 2G F n e (x). Here, G F is the Fermi constant and n e (x) is the electron matter density at the point x. Unlike propagation in the sun, where n e (x) is strongly varying and can cause highly nonlinear phenomena (MSW resonant flavor conversions [66]), the electron density in the earth crust and mantle is nearly constant. The oscillation formula corrected by matter effects in conditions interesting for long baseline experiment can be written as [67,68]: ",

The probability for\u03bd \u00b5 \u2192\u03bd e oscillations is the same as for neutrinos except for a change of the sign of the CP-violating phase \u03b4 CP and of the matter parameter A. Equation 8is an approximate formula that results from expanding to second order in the small quantities \u03b1 and sin \u03b8 13 under the hypothesis of a constant electron density n e . Exact formulas can be obtained integrating the propagation in steps of x and are commonly embedded in software as GLoBES [69]. Still, Equation (8) is an excellent approximation for all current long-baseline experiments. The change of sign of A is hence a fake CP violation effect due to the presence of electrons in matter and should be decoupled by genuine CP effects. On the other hand, fake CP effects depend on the sign of \u2206m 2 23 and, therefore, provide an elegant tool to determine whether m 1 < m 2 < m 3 (\"normal ordering\", NO) or m 3 < m 1 < m 3 (\"inverse ordering\", IO). All other ordering options are already excluded by solar neutrino data that imply \u2206m 2 12 > 0. Distinguishing \u2206m 2 23 < 0 (IO) from \u2206m 2 23 > 0 (NO) is extremely interesting not only for building theory models of neutrino masses and mixing. IO would imply that the eigenstate that is maximally mixed with \u03bd e is indeed the largest one. IO thus eases remarkably the measurement of the absolute neutrino masses and of neutrinoless double beta decay, which are entirely based on \u03bd e . NOVA is the only running experiment sensitive to matter effects because A = 0.046 in T2K and A = 0.12 in NO\u03bdA . Similarly, the CNGS is not sensitive to matter effect because it is off the peak of the oscillation maximum (\u2206 31 1) [70] and hence:",

Matter effects enhance the electron neutrino appearance probability in the case of normal mass hierarchy (NO) and suppress it for inverted mass hierarchy (IO). CP-conserving oscillations occur if \u03b4 = 0 or \u03c0, while the rate of \u03bd e CC is enhanced around \u03b4 = 3\u03c0/2, and suppressed around \u03b4 = \u03c0/2. At NO\u03bdA , the impact of these factors on the \u03bd e appearance probability are of similar magnitudes, which can lead to degeneracies between them, especially in neutrino runs alone. For antineutrinos, the mass hierarchy and CP phase have the opposite effect on the oscillation probability. Increasing values of sin 2 \u03b8 23 increase the appearance probabilities for \u03bd e and \u03bd e alike.

The classifier feeds an artificial neutral network, i.e., an input layer of perceptrons linked to additional hidden layers and an output node. The network is then trained to recognize different neutrino topologies: \u03bd e CC, \u03bd \u00b5 CC, and NC. The \u03bd \u00b5 CC and \u03bd e CC samples correspond to events whose score exceed a given threshold. Muon identification in \u03bd \u00b5 CC events is performed employing the dE/dX and multiple scattering of the track, the length of the track and the fraction of plane where the track is mip-like [65]. The NO\u03bdA analysis selects \u03bd \u00b5 CC events with an efficiency of 32.2%. In terms of purity, the final selected sample is 92.7% \u03bd \u00b5 CC. The energy of the muon is estimated from the range and the hadronic energy from the number of hits. The energy resolution for the whole sample of \u03bd \u00b5 CC is 9.1%. The quality of the simulation and event selection procedures are validated using the \u03bd \u00b5 CC reconstructed spectrum at the near detector, which is not distorted by oscillations. Possible discrepancies (in the 4%-13% range for \u03bd \u00b5 CC) are corrected to reach complete agreement with the near detector (ND) data. The \u2206m 2 23 and sin 2 2\u03b8 23 parameters are extracted from the spectrum of the \u03bd \u00b5 CC events at the far detector compared with the corresponding spectrum at the near detector. The selection of the \u03bd e CC sample is particularly difficult due to the presence of electromagnetic components in NC events (e.g., \u03c0 0 production) or short muon in \u03bd \u00b5 CC events. The near detector \u03bd e CC selected sample consists indeed of 42% \u03bd e CC, 30% NC and 28% \u03bd \u00b5 CC. The selection efficiency-i.e., the probability to select a true \u03bd e CC event-amounts to 67.4%. The estimator of the energy of the electron candidate has a resolution of 11%. Since the NC and cosmogenic background is mostly in the low energy range of the electron spectrum and the \u03bd e CC from the \u03bd e contamination of the beam dominates at large energies, the analysis is performed only for events whose energy is between 1 and 4 GeV. Again, the quality of the simulation is validated by ND data. In particular, \u03bd \u00b5 selected candidates are used to cross-check the \u03bd e selection efficiency and correct the expected \u03bd e signal at the far detector (FD). \u03bd e at ND are artificially created in the simulation replacing the muon with an electron of the same energy and direction. The \u03bd e CC selection algorithm is applied to this sample and the results match expectations within 2%. The intrinsic \u03bd e component of the beam (0.7% of all neutrinos) represents a nearly irreducible background. ND data are used to constrain such \u03bd e component beyond the estimate performed with GEANT4. ND data are also used to constrain the observed \u03bd \u00b5 CC and NC events (see Figure 5 of Reference [65]). For the 2018 NO\u03bdA analysis, corresponding to 8.85 \u00d7 10 20 pot, the overall error budget for sin 2 \u03b8 23 , \u2206m 2 23 and \u03b4 are 4 \u00d7 10 \u22122 , 9 \u00d7 10 \u22125 eV 2 and 0.67\u03c0, respectively. At present, the systematic budget is smaller than the statistical uncertainty and amounts to 1 \u00d7 10 \u22122 , 4 \u00d7 10 \u22125 eV 2 and 0.12\u03c0 for sin 2 \u03b8 23 , \u2206m 2 23 and \u03b4, respectively. However, it is likely that NO\u03bdA will be systematic limited in the forthcoming years, well before the start of DUNE.",

Accelerator neutrino beams became the technology of choice already in the late 1990s. At that time, experimental data start pointing toward two different mass scales (the atmospheric mass scale \u2206m 2 23 and the solar mass scale \u2206m 2 12 ), but the ratio of the scales (\u03b1 0.03 in Equation (8)) was not too small to prevent the observation of perturbations driven by \u2206m 2 in the leading \u03bd \u00b5 \u2192 \u03bd e transitions at the atmospheric scale. As a consequence, an intense and controlled \u03bd \u00b5 source of artificial neutrinos at the O(GeV) energy scale would have been the optimal facility to search, for instance, for CP violation in the leptonic sector. Unfortunately, at that time, \u03b8 13 was not known (the Chooz limits indicated \u03b8 13 < 12 \u2022 ), and the overall size of the leading \u03bd \u00b5 \u2192 \u03bd e oscillation could have been arbitrarily small.

As for NUMI, the primary proton beam will be extracted from the Main Injector in the energy range of 60-120 GeV. With the Main Injector upgrades already implemented for NO\u03bdA as well as with the expected implementation of PIP-II, each extraction will deliver 7.5 \u00d7 10 13 protons in one machine cycle (0.7 s/60 GeV-1.2 s/120 GeV) to the LBNF target in 10 \u00b5s. The complex delivers to DUNE an average power of 1.2 MW for 120 GeV protons. Neutrinos are produced after the protons hit a solid target and produce mesons which are subsequently focused by three magnetic horns into a 194 m long helium-filled decay pipe where they decay into muons and neutrinos. The facility is equipped with a near detector located 300 m after the absorber. Unlike its predecessor, LBNF has been designed to provide neutrinos over a wide energy range in order to cover both the first and the second oscillation maximum in DUNE. The beamline is designed to cope with a 2.4 MW power beam without retrofitting since an additional upgrade of the proton acceleration chain is planned (PIP-III) to be operational by 2030.",

The baseline design has been recently validated at CERN by means of a 770 ton prototype (ProtoDUNE-SP [87], with a fiducial mass of about 400 ton) using charged particle beams and cosmic rays. This \"single phase\" (SP) designs inherits the most important techniques developed by ICARUS (see Section 3) for the charge readout, HV, and the Argon purification system. Unlike ICARUS, ProtoDUNE-SP (see Figure 7) is engineered to be scalable up to a DUNE module. It means that the components of the TPC are modular and can be assembled on-site in the underground laboratory and the cryogenic system has been greatly simplified. ProtoDUNE-SP demonstrated that it is possible to achieve an electron lifetime comparable with ICARUS using a cryostat based on a very cheap technology developed for industrial applications. A \"membrane cryostat\" is made of a corrugated membrane that contains the liquid and gaseous Argon, a passive insulation that reduces the heat leak, and a reinforced concrete structure to which the pressure is transferred. A secondary barrier system embedded in the insulation protects it from potential spills of liquid Argon, and a vapor barrier over the concrete protects the insulation from the moisture of the concrete. This system is used for a long time for the transportation of liquified natural gases and has been tailored for use with high purity Argon during the R&D for DUNE. Unlike ICARUS, the charge readout electronic is located inside the cold volume to reduce noise, and the light detection system is based on Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs) embedded in the anode wire planes instead of large area PMTs. For the second module, DUNE is considering an innovative Double Phase LArTPC where the electrons are multiplied in the gas phase. The Double Phase (DP) readout allows for a lower energy threshold and a reduction of complexity and cost due to the longer drift length: in DP, the distance between the cathode and the anode is 6 m and the drift takes place in the vertical direction while the distance of the horizontal planes in a SP module is 3.5 m. This technique is currently under validation at CERN (ProtoDUNE-DP [88]).",

            "text": "Both DUNE and Hyper-Kamiokande have been designed firstly to provide a superior sensitivity to CP violation and mass hierarchy compared with the previous generation of long-baseline experiments. DUNE, in particular, is able to establish mass ordering at 5\u03c3 in 2.5 years of data taking whatever is the value of \u03b4 [89]. Similarly, it can establish CP violation in the leptonic sector at 5 (3) \u03c3 level in 10 (13) years for 50% (75%) of all possible values of \u03b4. If the value of \u03b4 is large, as suggested by current hints, CP violation can be established in about six years of data taking: statistics and control of the systematics will thus be crucial to improve the precision in the measurement of \u03b4 (about 20 \u2022 for \u03b4 = \u2212\u03c0/2). Table 3 summarizes the sensitivity for a selection of physics observables as a function of time. The number of years are computed assuming the standard DUNE staging scenario: the start of data taking of DUNE will commence after the commissioning of two DUNE modules (20 kton) with an average beam power of 1.2 MW (T0). In the next year (T0 + 1y), the third module will be in data taking (30 kton). DUNE will reach its full mass (40 kton) at T0 + 3y. The beam will be upgraded to 2.4 MW three years later, i.e., at T0+6y. Table 3. Time to achieve the most relevant physics milestones in DUNE for the current detector staging scenario (see text).",

This technique is the cornerstone of long-baseline experiments, and it consists of building an additional detector at a distance from the source where oscillations have not developed yet. The near detectors thus measure the \u03bd \u00b5 and \u03bd e interaction rate at source and are compared with the rate at the far detector. If the near detector is close to the source (a few hundreds meters) and identical to the far detector, it provides a normalization for the \u03bd \u00b5 and \u03bd e rates that can be used to extract \u03bd \u00b5 \u2192 \u03bd e and \u03bd \u00b5 \u2192 \u03bd \u00b5 probabilities accounting for the finite efficiency of the detector for \u03bd \u00b5 and \u03bd e CC events, provided that the corresponding cross-sections are properly known. If the detectors can measure both \u03bd \u00b5 and \u03bd e and the beam is monochromatic, the remaining systematics after the near-far cancellation is \u223c \u03c3 \u03bd e \u03bd e /\u03c3 \u03bd \u00b5 \u03bd \u00b5 . Unfortunately, other effects make the near-far detector comparison more challenging if systematics must be kept well below 10%. Firstly, the beam spectrum observed at the far location is different from the beam at source as observed in the near detector. This is due to the large difference between the angular acceptance of the two detectors. Such effect is exacerbated if the far detector is located off-axis with respect to the beam. In addition, high power beams have such large rates at close sites that pile-up effects may jeopardize the efficiency of the detector, increase the background of interactions in the surrounding material, and change the performance of PID algorithms. This is particularly disturbing for technologies that are intrinsically slow (liquid Argon TPC) or difficult to be operated at high pile-up rates (Cherenkov detectors). Pile-up effects can be mitigated by using fast neutrino detectors at the price of having the near detector different from the far detector. This is the method of choice of T2K for the ND280 and its upgrades (see Section 4). Finally, since no beam is monochromatic, the incoming neutrino energy must be reconstructed from the kinematics of final state particles, which in turn depend on final state interactions and nuclear effects. The simulation of these effects from first principles is beyond the state of electroweak nuclear physics and the models implemented in the neutrino generators must be tuned and validated by experimental data from either the near detector or dedicated cross-section experiments.",

Systematic errors have to be roughly halved if the investments for the huge exposures of next generation experiments have to be fully exploited.

Even if the technology envisaged in the upgrade of ND280 and in the DUNE high-pressure TPC are different from the far detector, they allow for a superior reconstruction of final state particles in CC events and can be operated at high rate. In DUNE, the high pressure (gas Argon) TPC is complemented by a modular liquid Argon TPC that is readout by pixels after a small (50 cm) drift length [95]. Unlike the on-axis detector (3DST embedded in the former KLOE magnet and calorimeter), this setup is movable horizontally in the plane perpendicular to the beam axis. It thus samples different beam angles to retrieve the relation between the incident and reconstructed neutrino energies in the detector (\"\"PRISM concept\" [96]). The same concept is under consideration in the Hyper-Kamiokande intermediate detector. This detector is located at a larger distance (\u223c2 km) than the N280 to reduce pile-up nuisance. In its nominal position, it samples a beam whose spectrum is the same as for the far detector. The intermediate detector, however, is movable in the vertical axis and thus implements the PRISM concept in the energy range of interest for T2K and Hyper-K [90].",

The results of these experiments showed significant disagreements with theory predictions and with the neutrino interaction generators used by long-baseline experiments.

Even if \u03c3 \u03bd e is still statistics dominated and can be improved by employing the near detectors of DUNE and T2K-II, the dominant systematic contribution to the muon and electron neutrino cross-sections will soon become the uncertainty on the flux of the short baseline beam used for the measurement of \u03c3 e/\u00b5 . This scenario advocates for a new generation of cross-section experiments with a highly controlled beam. The most promising candidates are the \"monitored neutrino beams\" [104] where the flux is measured in a direct manner monitoring the rate of leptons in the decay tunnel. In particular, the CERN NP06/ENUBET [105] experiment (ERC Consolidator Grant, PI A. Longhin) is aimed at designing a beamline where the positrons produced at large angles by K + \u2192 e + \u03c0 0 \u03bd e decays are monitored at single particle level to measure the flux of \u03bd e . Monitored neutrino beams may achieve a precision of <1% in the flux determination and deliver 10 4 (10 6 ) \u03bd e (\u03bd \u00b5 ) CC events per year in a 500 ton detector as ProtoDUNE-SP (CERN) or ICARUS (Fermilab). In addition, the ENUBET beam is a narrow band beam where the position of the neutrino interaction vertex in the neutrino detector is strongly correlated to the energy of the neutrino. It can therefore provide a 8% (22%) precision measurement of the energy of the incoming neutrino at 3 (1) GeV without relying on the kinematics of the final state particle. Energy reconstruction in total and differential cross-sections is thus not biased by nuclear effects. The ENUBET beamline can be exploited not only by LArTPCs but also by dedicated high-granularity detectors specifically designed for cross-section measurements at low and high Z. The impact of the ENUBET beamline on the measurement of the \u03bd e cross-section is depicted in Figure 12. A much larger statistics of \u03bd e can be achieved by changing the core technology of accelerator neutrino beams. R&D on muon colliders and Neutrino Factories are ongoing for more than 30 years. In a Neutrino Factory [106,107], it is possible to produce \u03bd e (\u03bd e ) at the ame pace as \u03bd \u00b5 (\u03bd \u00b5 ) from the three-body decay of muons stored in the accumulator ring. In its simplest design (NUSTORM [108,109]), a low energy Neutrino Factory can deliver up to 10 6 \u03bd e CC events per year to the same detectors employed for ENUBET. As a consequence, NUSTORM would represent both a powerful source for cross-section measurements and a major step forward in the design of facilities for the post-DUNE era (see Section 8).",

A confirmation of the persistent sterile neutrino hints [110] would change in a substantial manner the three-family oscillation paradigm considered in this paper and would urge a re-definition of the entire experimental strategy. Still, even in the framework of the minimally extended Standard Model, the Superbeams will not say the final word on lepton mixing. The PMNS precision in 2030 will still be very far from the precision achieved in the CKM. In flavor physics, the main tool to explore physics beyond the Standard Model are unitarity tests and inconsistencies between the mixing parameters measured by different channels: both tools require precision. In addition, the striking difference between the PMNS and CKM indicates that the entire Yukawa sector of the SM is not understood and that the origin of such difference may reside in physics at energy scales not accessible at accelerators. A percent level measurement of the PMNS combined with the study of neutrino non-standard interactions (NSI) and the \u03bd e \u2192 \u03bd \u03c4 transitions (unitarity tests) are the main route toward these scales and require employing neutrino oscillations at an unprecedented level of precision. Any upgrade of DUNE and Hyper-Kamiokande will be of little impact because, at full statistics, they will be limited by systematic errors and those errors cannot be further significantly reduced, being related to the intrinsic limitations of conventional neutrino beams. New concepts in neutrino beams, as Neutrino Factories and/or Beta Beams will then become necessary for any further development after the third generation of long baseline neutrino experiments. A bridge between the DUNE/Hyper-K era and the Neutrino Factory era will likely occur by upgrading existing facilities. In the European context, a special role will be played by the European Spallation Source, the most powerful proton source devised for material science studies. The infrastructure and technology of ESS can be upgraded to serve the neutrino science community with a low energy Superbeam operating at the second oscillation maximum (\u223c350 MeV) and, thus, with the largest CP sensitivity. The ESS also represents an interesting first stage facility for the implementation of the accelerator complex serving a Neutrino Factory and a high energy Muon Collider.",

In this paper, we reviewed the most important experimental results provided by neutrino beam experiments and interpreted these results in the framework of the minimally extended Standard Model. Neutrino beams have established in a conclusive manner the appearance of tau neutrinos (\u03bd \u00b5 \u2192 \u03bd \u03c4 oscillations) at CNGS and of electron neutrinos (\u03bd \u00b5 \u2192 \u03bd e oscillations) at J-PARC and NUMI. T2K and NO\u03bdA lead the measurements of the oscillation parameters at the atmospheric scale (\u2206m 2 23 and \u03b8 23 ). In particular, the T2K+NO\u03bdA combined measurements provide hints both of normal hierarchy and of CP violation. These hints will be checked conclusively in the next generation of Superbeam, namely by DUNE and Hyper-Kamiokande. Our field is now in a stage where a superior control of systematics and a precision knowledge of neutrino interactions in matter is of paramount importance to ground the physics reach of the Superbeams. These needs foster a vigorous systematic reduction program based on movable near detectors, hadroproduction experiments, and a new generation of facilities for the study of cross-sections at the GeV scale.",
