CMS is well suited to measure quarkonia decays to muons given the muon identification and charged particle tracking capability. We report here prompt, non-prompt J/\u03c8, and \u03a5 production measured by the CMS experiment in pp collisions at \u221a s = 7 TeV. In addition, the J/\u03c8 and \u03a5 production in PbPb at \u221a s NN = 2.76 TeV and pp collisions at the same per nucleon energy are measured and compared. Prompt and non-prompt J/\u03c8 contributions are separated for the first time in heavy-ion collisions, as is the ground from the excited states in the \u03a5 family. Suppression in PbPb at \u221a s NN = 2.76 TeV is quantified for prompt J/\u03c8, B \u2192 J/\u03c8, and \u03a5(1S), as well as the relative suppression of \u03a5(2S+3S) compared to \u03a5(1S).",

            "text": "Quarkonia are especially relevant for studying the quark gluon plasma (QGP) since they are produced at early times and propagate through the medium mapping its evolution. In particular, J/\u03c8 in heavy-ion collisions was suggested to be a promising probe as the deconfined medium should screen the two quarks leading to a suppression of its production [1]. It has been studied at different energies and with different collision systems without yet giving a fully understood global picture [2][3][4][5]. Measuring the charmonium production at the LHC energies in PbPb collisions will help constrain predictions, in particular those with a large recombination probability for prompt J/\u03c8s. Indeed, the abundance of charm quarks in the medium could lead to a strong production enhancement at LHC energies [6]. In addition to charmonium precision studies, the LHC center-of-mass energy allows copious \u03a5 production in PbPb collisions. Detailed measurements of bottomonia will help characterize the dense matter produced in heavy-ion collisions complementing the measurements accessible at RHIC energies. The full spectroscopy of quarkonium states has been suggested as a possible thermometer for the QGP [7]. This paper first reviews CMS J/\u03c8 and \u03a5 cross-section measurements in pp collisions at \u221a s NN = 7 TeV, which allow precision studies of quarkonia production, as well as at \u221a s NN = 2.76 TeV, which will serve as a reference for the observation of hot nuclear effects in PbPb at the same energy. CMS is able to distinguish non-prompt J/\u03c8 from prompt J/\u03c8 in both pp and PbPb collisions. The nuclear modification factor (R AA ) of prompt, non-prompt J/\u03c8, and \u03a5(1S) in PbPb is measured as a function of transverse momentum (p T ), rapidity (y) and number of nucleons participating (N part ) in the collision [8]. Finally, the relative suppression of the excited states compared to the ground state is quantified [9].",

Muons are detected for the |\u03b7| < 2.4 range, with detection planes based on three technologies: drift tubes, cathode strip chambers, and resistive plate chambers. Due to the strong magnetic field and the fine granularity of the silicon tracker, the muon transverse momentum measurement based on information from the silicon tracker alone has a resolution between 1 and 2% for a typical muon in this analysis. CMS is therefore very well suited to measure dimuons. In pp, the resolution obtained measuring J/\u03c8 in |y| < 0.5 is 20 MeV/c 2 , and 67 MeV/c 2 for the \u03a5(1S) in |\u03b7 \u00b5 | < 1.",

On Fig. 1 (right), the B \u2192 J/\u03c8 CMS cross-section measurement with L int = 314 nb \u22121 is overlaid with different predictions which reproduces well the data down to low p T in the forward region (1.6 < |y| < 2.4). CMS is able to identify the three \u03a5 states as shown on Fig. 2 (left) and has measured the \u03a5(1S), \u03a5(2S) and \u03a5(3S) cross-sections as a function of p T [12]. Fig. 2 (right) shows that the shape of the \u03a5(1S) cross-section is well reproduced by PYTHIA but not the normalization which is overestimated by a factor two.  In March 2011, CMS recorded a little more than L int = 220 nb \u22121 pp events at \u221a s = 2.76 TeV. This data is used as a reference for the PbPb measurement. In November 2010, CMS recorded L int = 7.28 \u00b5b \u22121 of PbPb events, leading to about the same amount of quarkonia statistics as the reference pp run at 2.76 TeV. Both data sets have been analyzed following similar conditions [8,9]: (1) events are selected by the CMS two-level trigger keeping any dimuon activity in the muon chambers, (2) offline muon reconstruction is seeded with 99% efficient tracks in the muon detectors, which are then matched to tracks reconstructed in the silicon tracker by means of an algorithm optimized for the heavy-ion environment [13,14], (3) the same analysis procedure is followed for the offline selection with very loose criteria. Signal extraction is based on the procedures in CMS 7 TeV publications for the signal extraction [11,12].",

Trigger, reconstruction and selection efficiencies of muon pairs are estimated using quarkonia PYTHIA signal embedded in heavy-ion PbPb events generated by HYDJET [18]. These events were processed through the trigger emulation and event reconstruction chain. The final efficiency corrections correspond to the fraction of reconstructed signal passing all the analysis selections with respect to the generated signal. Fig. 3 (left) shows this dimuon efficiency as a function of N part for \u03a5 (diamonds), prompt (circles) and non-prompt (stars) J/\u03c8. The individual components of the MC efficiency are cross checked using a tag-and-probe technique applied to data [11]. The method consists of fitting the J/\u03c8 candidates, with and without applying the probed selection on one of the muons. For example, the dimuon trigger efficiency is probed by testing the trigger response from a single-muon triggered sample. Fig. 3 (right) shows that the single muon efficiency for the dimuon trigger used in the analysis as a function of p T measured in data (95.1 \u00b1 0.9)% (squares) is compatible with MC (circles). The CMS detector performs very well in heavy-ion environment such that the good momentum resolution can be used to separate non-prompt from prompt J/\u03c8 as in pp, making use of the distance between the non-prompt vertex and the primary vertex. An example of the 2dimensional fit in PbPb collisions is shown on Fig. 4 for J/\u03c8 with p T > 6.5 GeV/c. For more details see [8,20,21].  For the first time, secondary J/\u03c8 R AA is measured in heavy-ion collisions. Fig. 5 (left) illustrates B-meson suppression through their J/\u03c8 decays through the R AA as a function of N part : R AA = 0.36 \u00b1 0.08(stat) \u00b1 0.03(syst) in the 20% most central collisions. This could be a hint of b-quark energy loss. The level of suppression is of the same order of magnitude as charged hadrons as observed on Fig. 5 (right) where the non-prompt J/\u03c8 R AA is plotted as a function of p T for 0-20% while the bosons and charged hadrons are presented as a function of the transverse mass for 0-10% [19].

Furthermore, CMS measures less suppression at forward rapidity for high p T J/\u03c8. One should remember that the x probed with p J/\u03c8 T = 10 GeV/c by CMS over |y| < 2.4 are x 1 \u223c 0.02 and x 2 \u223c 5 \u2022 10 \u22124 . Therefore, anti-shadowing could play a role in the suppression observed and could contribute to seeing an opposite trend than PHENIX as a function of y, or an increase of the R AA when going to low p T and more forward regions as for ALICE measurements [24]. For p T > 3 GeV/c and 1.6 < y < 2.4, CMS measures R AA = 0.39 \u00b1 0.06(stat.) \u00b1 0.03(syst.). Finally, in the 10% most central collisions, CMS observes a factor five suppression much greater than measured by STAR.  CMS is able to disentangle the \u03a5(1S) contribution from the higher states in PbPb as in pp collisions. Fig. 7 compares the \u03a5 invariant mass distribution at \u221a s = 2.76 TeV in pp (left) and PbPb (right) collisions, for p \u00b5 T > 4 GeV/c. The higher state contribution relative to the ground state is strikingly smaller in PbPb collisions. In order to quantify this suppression, an extended unbinned maximum likelihood simultaneous fit to the pp and PbPb mass spectra is performed, following the method described in [9], using the parameters detailed in [25]. The ratio of \u03a5(2S + 3S)/\u03a5(1S) in PbPb and pp benefits from an almost complete cancellation of possible acceptance and/or efficiency differences among the reconstructed resonances. The double ratio obtained is",

This seems to disappear for p T > 6.5 GeV/c. The rapidity dependence indicates a slightly smaller suppression at forward In summary, this paper first presented highlights of CMS quarkonia measurements in pp collisions at \u221a s = 7 GeV recorded in 2010. The high statistics accumulated at the LHC allows to perform details studies that further constrain production mechanisms. CMS has performed the measurements of the prompt and non-prompt J/\u03c8, as well as of the \u03a5(1S) and \u03a5(2S+3S) mesons via their decay into \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 pairs in PbPb and pp collisions at 2.76 TeV. Prompt J/\u03c8 has been separated from non-prompt J/\u03c8 for the first time in heavy-ion collisions. A strong suppression of prompt J/\u03c8 with p T > 6.5 GeV/c is measured in central collisions, and already in peripheral collisions, showing a clear dependence with centrality. Non-prompt J/\u03c8, though strongly suppressed, show no strong centrality dependence within uncertainties. This is the first hint of b-quark energy loss in the hot medium. Furthermore, \u03a5(1S) are suppressed by 40% in the 20% most central collisions. The comparison of the ratios of \u03a5(nS)-states in pp and PbPb collisions, taken at the same center-of-mass energy, is consistent with the partial disappearance of the higher states with respect to the ground state in the PbPb collisions. Those two observations could indicate that the \u03a5(1S) suppression is due to the melting of the excited states only in PbPb",
