The analysis is based on an integrated luminosity of 1.0 fb \u22121 recorded by the LHCb experiment. Results are shown with two jet transverse momentum thresholds, 10 and 20 GeV, for both the overall cross-section within the fiducial volume, and for six differential cross-section measurements. The fiducial volume requires that both the jet and the muons from the Z boson decay are produced in the forward direction (2.0 < \u03b7 < 4.5). The results show good agreement with theoretical predictions at the second-order expansion in the coupling of the strong interaction.",

            "text": "Measurements of electroweak boson production in the forward region are sensitive to parton distribution functions (PDFs) at low Bjorken-x which are not particularly well constrained by previous results [1]. The LHCb experiment has recently presented measurements of inclusive W and Z boson 1 production in the muon decay channels [2] and inclusive Z boson production in the electron [3] and the tau lepton [4] decay channels. This article presents a measurement of the inclusive Z+jet production cross-section in proton-proton collisions at LHCb. These interactions typically involve the collision of a sea quark or gluon with a valence quark, and measurements of Z boson production in association with jets are sensitive to the gluon content of the proton [5]. LHCb is sensitive to a region of phase space in which both the Z boson and the jet are produced in the forward region. Measurements at LHCb are therefore complementary to those at ATLAS [6] and CMS [7,8]. Hence, measurements of the Z+jet production cross-section at LHCb enable comparisons of different PDF predictions and their relative performances in this previously unprobed region of phase space. The Z+jet production cross-section, in addition to being sensitive to the PDFs at low Bjorken-x, is influenced by higher order contributions in perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD). Studies of the Drell-Yan process in the forward region are sensitive to 1 Throughout this article Z includes both the Z and the virtual photon (\u03b3 * ) contribution.",

The analysis is performed in a fiducial region that closely corresponds to the kinematic coverage of the LHCb detector. For the dimuon decay of the Z boson, this requirement is the same as that in ref. [2]. Both final state muons are required to have a transverse momentum, 2 p \u00b5 T , greater than 20 GeV, and to have pseudorapidity 3 in the range 2.0 < \u03b7 \u00b5 < 4.5. The invariant mass of the dimuon system is required to be in the range 60 < M \u00b5\u00b5 < 120 GeV. Jets are reconstructed using the anti-k T algorithm [18] with distance parameter R = 0.5, and are required to be in the fiducial region 2.0 < \u03b7 jet < 4.5, and to be separated from decay muons of the Z boson by \u2206r(\u00b5, jet) > 0.4.

Results are presented for two thresholds of the jet transverse momentum: p jet T > 20 GeV and p jet T > 10 GeV. Both the total Z+jet cross-section and the cross-section ratio of Z+jet production to inclusive Z production are reported. In addition, six differential cross-sections for Z+jet production are presented as a function of the Z boson rapidity and transverse momentum, the pseudorapidity and transverse momentum of the leading 4 jet, and the difference in azimuthal angle and in rapidity between the Z boson and this jet. These differential measurements are presented normalised to the total Z+jet cross-section.

Reweighting the simulation to have the same jet pseudorapidity distribution as data has a negligible effect on the efficiency. This efficiency is about 75 % for jets with transverse momentum of about 10 GeV, but rises to about 96 % for high transverse momentum jets, as shown in figure 1.

These are found to agree at the level of about 3 %. This is therefore used as a systematic uncertainty. The efficiency is cross-checked on the independent inclusive Z sample, and the difference is taken as an additional systematic uncertainty. The efficiency associated with the jet reconstruction, neglecting the jet identification requirements, is found to be about 98.5 % at low transverse momentum, so an additional 1.5 % uncertainty is assigned to this reconstruction efficiency component of \u03b5 jet at low momentum. The jet-energy scale and resolution show no dependence on the separation of the Z -9 -JHEP01(2014)033 and the jet in the azimuthal angle. The jet-energy scale and resolution uncertainties associated with how well the detector response to jets is modelled in simulated data are therefore determined by selecting Z+1-jet events that are azimuthally opposed. In these events the Z boson and jet transverse momenta are expected to balance. Hence, the Z boson transverse momentum can be used as a proxy for the true jet transverse momentum. The p jet T /p Z T distribution in the selected events is shown in figure 2, and is also considered as a function of the jet pseudorapidity and transverse momentum. The mean is found to agree between data and simulation at the level of about 3 %, consistent within the statistical precision. The width is consistent between data and simulation, and the resolution in simulation can be smeared at the level of about 10 % whilst maintaining this agreement. Based on these comparisons, systematic uncertainties to account for the reliability of the modelling are assigned to the jet-energy scale and resolution. In addition, a systematic uncertainty is assigned based on the difference in the jet-energy scale for gluon-and quark-initiated jets, and for the method used to correct the jet-energy scale. This contributes an additional 2 % systematic uncertainty on the jet-energy scale. These uncertainties are then propagated into the cross-sections and distributions measured. The contribution from the uncertainty on the jet-energy scale is the dominant uncertainty in most bins analysed. The systematic uncertainty on the FSR correction applied to the total cross-section is determined by comparing the correction taken from Herwig++ [37] and from Pythia [23] interfaced with Photos [27], as found in ref.

The results for the differential cross-sections, uncorrected for final state radiation from the muons, are presented in figures 4-9. For all cases reasonable agreement is seen between the Standard Model calculations and the data. The O(\u03b1 2 s ) predictions tend to give better agreement with data than the O(\u03b1 s ) prediction. This is most noticeably seen in the Z boson transverse momentum distribution, shown in figure 7. For high values of the boson transverse momentum, the O(\u03b1 2 s ) predictions have a slope compatible with that in data, whereas the O(\u03b1 s ) prediction is steeper than data. The O(\u03b1 2 s ) predictions also match the data better for the \u2206\u03c6 distribution, as shown in figure 8. The O(\u03b1 s ) prediction overestimates the number of events where the Z boson and jet are azimuthally opposed. Higher orders in pQCD are needed to simulate the production of Z bosons and jets that are not produced back-to-back as the parton shower tends to produce partons collinear with the parton produced in the hard interaction. Whilst the different PDF parametrisations studied agree with the data, there are hints of tension between the PDF sets in the \u2206y distribution, shown in figure 9.",
