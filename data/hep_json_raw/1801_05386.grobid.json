The standard model in particle physics includes neutrinos as one of the fundamental point-like building blocks. Processes involving the production and interaction of neutrinos provided crucial inputs for formulating the electroweak theory, unifying the electromagnetic and weak interactions. Neutrinos also play a prominent role in cosmology. The abundant neutrinos produced soon after the big bang offer the potential to view the Universe at an epoch much earlier than that accessible from the cosmic microwave background. The direct detection of these 'relic' neutrinos from the big bang remains a major experimental challenge. For a long time, these neutrinos were also considered a prime candidate for dark matter. While this is no longer viable given the current upper limit on the neutrino mass, neutrinos nevertheless constitute a non-negligible fraction of the invisible mass in the Universe.",

            "text": "In his famous letter to \"radioactive ladies and gentlemen\", Pauli postulated [1] in 1930 the existence of a new charge-neutral weakly interacting particle emitted undetected in nuclear beta decay. This spin-1/2 particle would not only resolve the outstanding puzzle of energy non-conservation, but also explain the apparent violation of angular momentum conservation in nuclear beta decay. Soon after Pauli's neutrino postulate, Fermi formulated [2,3] in 1933 his celebrated theory of nuclear beta decay, taking into account Pauli's neutrino, and successfully explained the experimental data. While Fermi's theory provided convincing evidence for the existence of the neutrino, a direct detection of the neutrino had to wait for many years. The prospect for directly detecting the neutrino was considered by Bethe and Peierls [4], who suggested the so-called 'inverse beta decay' (IBD), \u03bd e + p \u2192 e + + n, as a possible reaction to detect the neutrino. However, they estimated a tiny IBD cross section (\u223c10 \u221242 cm 2 ), prompting them to conclude that \"...there is no practically possible way of observing the neutrino.\" Responding to this conclusion, Pauli commented that \"I have done something very bad by proposing a particle that cannot be detected; it is something no theorist should ever do [5].\"",

A search for proton stability was also carried out, resulting in a lifetime of free protons (bound nucleons) greater than 10 21 (10 22 ) yr. By inserting a sample of Nd 2 O 3 enriched in 150 Nd inside the liquid scintillator, they searched for neutrinoless double beta decay from 150 Nd and set a lower limit on the half-life at 2.2 \u00d7 10 18 yr [12].

Indeed, Fermi was in favor of a massless neutrino as a simple and elegant scenario, putting the neutrino in the same class of particles as the photon and the graviton [13]. A finite neutrino mass could be revealed from a precise measurement of the endpoint energy of nuclear beta decay, notably tritium beta decay. While the precision of tritium beta decay experiments continued to improve, yet no definitive evidence for a finite neutrino mass was found [14].

After the muon neutrino was discovered, this idea was extended to the possible mixing and oscillation between neutrinos of different flavors (i.e., mixing between the electron neutrino and muon neutrino) [17,18,19]. Neutrino oscillation is a quantum mechanical phenomenon when neutrinos are produced in a state that is a superposition of eigenstates of different mass. As such, this oscillation is possible only when at least one neutrino mass eigenstate possesses a non-zero mass. The pattern of the oscillation, if found, will directly reveal the amount of mixing (in terms of mixing angle), as well as masssquared difference (i.e., \u2206m 2 21 \u2261 m 2 2 \u2212 m 2 1 ).

In the early 1980s, two reactor neutrino experiments reported possible evidence for neutrino oscillation. The experiment performed by Reines and collaborators [20] at the Savannah River reactor found an intriguing difference between the detected number of electron antineutrinos and the sum of electron and other types of antineutrinos using a deuteron (heavy water) target. The distinctions among different types of neutrino flavors were made possible through the observation of neutralcurrent as well as charged-current disintegration of the deuteron, a method adopted later by the SNO solar neutrino experiment. The larger number of neutrinos observed for the neutral-current events than that for the charged-current ones suggested that some electron neutrinos had oscillated into other types of neutrinos as they traveled from the reactor to the detector.",

The first observation of reactor neutrino oscillation was reported in 2002 by the KamLAND experiment [26]. Amusingly, while earlier experiments were located at relatively short distances from the reactors in order to have reasonable event rates, KamLAND was situated at an average distance of \u223c180 km from the neutrino sources. At such a large distance, corresponding to a long oscillation period, the relevant neutrino mass scale is tiny, of the order of \u2206m 2 \u223c10 \u22124 eV 2 . This long distance allows one to probe the large mixing angle (LMA) solution, one of the few possible explanations to the solar neutrino problem (see Sec. 3.2 for more details). The KamLAND result, together with the analysis [27] of experiments reporting the observation of solar neutrino oscillation, allowed an accurate determination of the mixing angle (\u03b8 12 ) governing these oscillations. The KamLAND result remains the best measurement of \u2206m 2 21 .",

Despite being straightforward, several challenges in this method lead to large uncertainties in predicting the flux and spectrum. First, the fission yields, \u03b2-decay branching ratios, and the endpoint energies are sometimes not well known, especially for short-lived fragments having large beta-decay Q values. Second, the precise calculation of the individual spectrum shape P (E\u03bd, E n,i 0 ) requires a good model of the Coulomb distortions (including radiative corrections, the nuclear finite-size effects, and weak magnetism) in the case of an allowed decay type having zero orbital angular momentum transfer. Finally, many of the decay channels are of the forbidden types having non-zero orbital angular momentum transfer. For example, about 25% of decays are the first forbidden type involving parity change, in which the individual spectrum shape P (E\u03bd, E n,i 0 ) is poorly known. Generally, a 10-20% relative uncertainty on the antineutrino spectra is obtained using this method.",

With these contributions, the model uncertainty in the flux is estimated to be \u223c2% [46,47]. However, the uncertainties resulting from spectrum shape and magnitude of the numerous first forbidden \u03b2 decays can be substantial [61]. When the first forbidden decays are included, the estimated uncertainty increases to \u223c5% [61]. Besides these model uncertainties, the total experimental uncertainty of th\u0113 \u03bd e spectrum further includes the contribution from the thermal power of the reactor, its time-dependent fuel composition (i.e., fission fractions), and fission energies associated with 235 U, 238 U, 239 Pu, and 241 Pu.",

The measured flux of all neutrino flavors from the NC channel was entirely consistent with the prediction of SSM [106], while the measured \u03bd e flux from the CC channel clearly showed a deficit.

To resolve this ambiguity, a reactor neutrino experiment, the Kamioka Liquid-scintillator ANtineutrino Detector (KamLAND) [26], was constructed in Japan to search with high precision for the \u223cMeV reactor\u03bd e oscillation at \u223c200 km.

As shown in Fig. 10A, the plant hosted six reactor cores whose locations were grouped into three clusters: the Daya Bay, Ling Ao, and Ling Ao II clusters. The total thermal power was about 17.4 GW. To monitor antineutrino flux from the three reactor clusters, near-detector sites were implemented. Two near-detector sites: the Daya Bay site (\u223c363 m from the Daya Bay cluster) and the Ling Ao site (\u223c500 m from the Ling Ao and Ling Ao II clusters) were constructed. The locations of the near and far sites were chosen to maximize the sensitivity to \u03b8 13 . In particular, the Ling Ao near site and the far site were both located at approximately equal distances from the Ling Ao and Ling Ao II clusters, largely reducing the effect of antineutrino flux uncertainties from these two clusters. The average baseline of the far site was \u223c1.7 km. Each near underground site hosted two antineutrino detectors (ADs). The far site hosted four ADs that pair with the four ADs of the two near sites, providing a maximal cancellation of detector effects. The effective vertical overburdens were 250, 265, and 860 m.w.e. for the Daya Bay site (EH-1), the Ling Ao site (EH-2), and the far site (EH-3), respectively. With the near-and far-sites configuration, the contribution from reactor flux uncertainties was suppressed by a factor of  Figure 11.

A few-percent contamination from accidental backgrounds (symmetric under interchange of prompt and delayed energy) and 9 Li decay and fast neutron backgrounds (high prompt and \u223c8 MeV delayed energy) are visible within the selected region. Inverse beta decay interactions where the neutron was captured on hydrogen provided an additional signal region with delayed energy around 2.2 MeV, albeit with much higher background.",

The innermost region was filled with 20 tons of Gd-doped linear-alkylbenzene-based liquid scintillator (LAB GdLS). An array of 192 8-inch PMTs was installed on each AD. Three automated calibration units (ACUs) [128] were equipped to periodically calibrate the detector response. Similar to KamLAND, ADs were placed inside high-purity water pools to reduce radioactive backgrounds from the environment. With PMTs installed, the water pool was also operated as an independent water Cerenkov detector to veto cosmic muons [129,130]. Each water pool was further split into two sub-detectors, so that the efficiency in each sub-detector could be cross calibrated. A plane of resistive plate chambers (RPC) was installed on the top of each water pool as an active muon veto. Figure 11 shows the distribution of prompt versus delayed energy for signal pairs satisfied the\u03bd e selection criteria, which included a crucial cut on the time difference between the prompt and delayed signals (1 < \u2206t < 200 \u00b5s). Five sources of backgrounds were identified. Ordering them in terms of their magnitudes at the near halls, they were accidental coincidence background, \u03b2-n decays from cosmogenic 9 Li and 8 He, fast neutrons produced by untagged muons, correlated \u03b3-rays from Am-C neutron calibration units [131], and background from the (\u03b1, n) reactions [124]. The accidental coincidence background was evaluated with high precision. Two of the three Am-C sources were removed during the 8-AD period for background reduction. Using information from the muon veto system, the fast neutron background rate was well determined. The total backgrounds accounted for \u223c3% (2%) of the IBD candidate sample in the far (near) sites before the background subtraction.",

In addition to the various systematic uncertainties in the previous rate analysis, the absolute detector energy response was another important ingredient to extract |\u2206m 2 ee |, since the spectral distortion depended on \u2206m 2 ee L E\u03bd . A physics-based energy model was constructed and constrained by calibrations using various \u03b3-ray sources and the well-known 12 B beta decay spectrum [124].  Figure 13 shows reconstructed positron energy spectra for the IBD candidate events from Daya Bay [124]. The best fit curve corresponds to sin 2 2\u03b8 13 = 0.0841 \u00b1 0.0027 (stat.) \u00b1 0.0019 (syst.) and |\u2206m 2 ee | = 2.50 \u00b1 0.06 (stat.) \u00b1 0.06 (syst.) \u00d7 10 \u22123 eV 2 [124]. Figure 14 shows the measured\u03bd e disappearance probability as a function of L/E \u03bd . As shown in Fig. 15, improved measurements were reported at the Neutrino 2018 conference [92]. Another benefit of the 'large' value of \u03b8 13 is that a different sample of the IBD events using neutron capture on hydrogen (nH) in both the GdLS and LS regions can also be employed to independently measure \u03b8 13 . Since the oscillation signal is large, many systematic associated with the nH channel, which are generally larger than those of the nGd channel, become less important. The details of extracting \u03b8 13 using the nH channel from Daya Bay can be found in Ref. [136,73].",

            "text": "The Reactor Experiment for Neutrino Oscillation (RENO) was a short-baseline reactor neutrino experiment built near the Hanbit nuclear power plant in South Korea. Like the Daya Bay experiment, RENO was designed to measure the mixing angle \u03b8 13 . The six reactor cores in RENO had a total thermal power of 16.4 GW. The reactor cores were equally spaced in a straight line, with the near and far detector sites located along a line perpendicular to and bisecting the reactor line. The near site was \u223c290 m from the geometric center of reactor cores, while the far site, located on the opposite side of the reactor line, was at a distance of \u223c1380 m. Because of the large variation in the distances between the near detector and various reactor cores, the suppression of the uncertainty in the reactor neutrino flux was less than ideal. Taking a similar approach as Daya Bay, RENO adopted a threezone LS antineutrino detector nested in a muon veto system. The central target zone contained 16 tons of 0.1% Gd-doped LAB LS. A total of 354 10-inch PMTs were mounted on the inner wall and the top and bottom surfaces of a stainless steel container. Unlike Daya Bay, RENO had one detector in each experimental site.",

            "text": "RENO started data taking in both the near and far detectors in the summer of 2011, ahead of all competing experiments. The first RENO \u03b8 13 result was published in Ref. [35] in 2012. This result was in agreement with Daya Bay's finding of a non-zero \u03b8 13 [34] with a near-5\u03c3 confidence level. The observation of a 4 MeV-6 MeV anomaly in the prompt energy spectrum, which is discussed in detail in Sec. 4.3, was first reported by RENO [137]. Most recently, RENO also reported a measurement of |\u2206m 2 ee | from the antineutrino energy spectral distortion [138], which was consistent with world measurements. Figure 15 shows RENO's latest results on sin 2 2\u03b8 13 and |\u2206m 2 ee |, reported at the Neutrino 2018 conference [92]. In particular, the first measurement of |\u2206m 2 ee | using the nH channel was performed. Double Chooz built upon the former CHOOZ experiment that set the best upper limit of sin 2 2\u03b8 13 prior to the discovery of a non-zero \u03b8 13 . It added a near site detector at a distance of \u223c410 m with a 115-m.w.e. overburden. The far site was the original CHOOZ detector site, having a 1067 m baseline and a 300-m.w.e. overburden. The total thermal power of the two Double Chooz reactors was 8.7 GW. Based on the original CHOOZ design, Double Chooz adopted the three-zone design. Instead of LAB-based LS, Double Chooz's central target region was a 10-ton PXE-based LS. For each detector, 390 low-background 10-inch PMTs were mounted on the inner surfaces of the stainless steel container. Unlike Daya Bay, Double Chooz had one detector in each experimental site. Because of a construction delay, the first result of Double Chooz [36,139], a 1.7\u03c3 hint of a non-zero \u03b8 13 , included only the far-site data. To constrain the reactor neutrino flux uncertainty, Double Chooz used the Bugey-4 measurement [140] to normalize the flux. The systematic uncertainties of the first result were subsequently improved, as reported in Ref. [141], with backgrounds constrained by the reactor-off data. An improved measurement of \u03b8 13 with about twice the antineutrino flux exposure was reported in Ref. [142]. Double Chooz carried out the first independent \u03b8 13 analysis using the neutroncapture-on-hydrogen data [143,144]. The Double Chooz near detector started taking data in 2014. The latest Double Chooz result using both near and far detector data yielded sin 2 2\u03b8 13 = 0.105 \u00b1 0.014 [92]. Figure 15 summarizes the status of \u03b8 13 and |\u2206m 2 32 | after the Neutrino 2018 conference [92]. The precision of sin 2 2\u03b8 13 from Daya Bay was better than 3.5%, making it the best measured mixing angle. Given the relatively 'large' value of \u03b8 13 , the |\u2206m 2 32 | was measured precisely using reactor neutrinos, given the well-controlled systematics for the detector and the antineutrino flux. In particular, the precision of |\u2206m 2 32 | from Daya Bay had reached a similar precision as those from accelerator neutrino and atmospheric neutrino experiments, as shown in Fig. 15.",

In contrast to the mass hierarchy sensitivity, the sensitivity to CP violation is approximately independent of the value of \u03b8 13 [147].

[152] for a recent review) . The determination of the MH, together with searches for neutrinoless double beta decay, may reveal whether neutrinos are Dirac or Majorana fermions, which could significantly advance our understanding of the Universe. The precise measurement of sin 2 2\u03b8 13 by the current generation of short-baseline reactor neutrino experiments has provided a unique opportunity to determine the MH in a medium-baseline (\u223c55 km) reactor neutrino experiment [151,153,154,155,156,157,158,159]. The oscillation from the atmospheric mass-squared difference manifests itself in the energy spectrum as multiple cycles that contain the MH information, as shown in the following formula derived from Eq. 12: P\u03bd e \u2192\u03bde = 1 \u2212 2s 2 13 c 2 13 \u2212 4c 2   The other two unknowns are the CP phase \u03b4 CP and the absolute neutrino mass. In addition, the octant of \u03b8 23 , i.e., whether \u03b8 23 is larger or smaller than 45 \u2022 , is also an interesting question. \u03c6 shows a clear dependence on the neutrino energy. Such a dependence is the key to determine the MH. The plot is taken from Ref. [151].",

The principle of determining MH through spectral distortion can be understood from Fig. 16B, which shows the energy and baseline dependent \u2206m 2 \u03c6 := 4E \u2022 \u03c6/L, based on Eq. (19). The three lines represent three different choices of energy resolution. In the region left of the line, the measurement of \u2206m 2 \u03c6 is compromised. Above \u223c40 km, \u2206m 2 \u03c6 possesses a clear energy dependence. In particular, at \u223c50 km, \u2206m 2 \u03c6 at low-energy region (2 MeV-4 MeV) is larger than that at high-energy region (4)(5)(6)(7)(8). This distinction provides an excellent opportunity to determine the MH. For NH, the \u2206m 2 ef f := 2|\u2206m 2 32 | + \u2206m 2 \u03c6 measured in the lowenergy region (2 MeV-4 MeV) would be higher than that measured in the high-energy region (4 MeV-8 MeV). In comparison, for the IH, the \u2206m 2 ef f := 2|\u2206m 2 32 | \u2212 \u2206m 2 \u03c6 measured in the low-energy region would be lower than that measured at high energy. Figure 16A shows the reactor neutrino energy spectra at a baseline of 52.5 km for both NH and IH. The choice of MH leads to a shift in the oscillation pattern at lowenergy region relative to that at high-energy region.",

With \u223c100k IBD events from reactor neutrinos (about six years data-taking), JUNO aims to determine the MH at 3\u03c3 sensitivity. \u2020 \u2020 This goal in sensitivity relies on an unprecedented 3%/ E (MeV) energy resolution, which requires a \u223c80% photo-cathode coverage, an increase in both LS light yield and attenuation length, and an increase in PMT quantum efficiency. In addition, excellent control of the energy-scale uncertainty [151,159,162] is crucial.",

The main goal was to search for neutrino oscillation. In this experiment, two LS detectors having a total of three detector modules measured\u03bd e generated from two reactors (reactor 4 and 5) at three different baselines (15 m, 40 m, and 95 m) [24]. Each detector module was a 600-liter 6 Lidoped LS having dimensions of 122\u00d762\u00d785 cm 3 [189]. Each module was optically divided into independent cells having dimensions of 8\u00d78\u00d785 cm 3 . Every cell was instrumented on each side by a PMT. The pressurized water reactor was approximated as a cylinder of \u223c1.6 m radius and \u223c3.7 m height. Bugey-3 detected IBD interactions with recoil neutrons captured by 6 Li (see Table 2). The energy resolution was about 6% at 4.2 MeV. The ratios of the measured positron energy spectrum to the Monte Carlo prediction at all three distances did not show any signature of oscillation, and exclusion contours were made in the phase space of sin 2 2\u03b8 14 and \u2206m 2 41 (see Fig. 17).

Given its unique configuration of multiple baselines to three groups of nuclear reactors, the Daya Bay experiment also allowed a search for sterile neutrinos through relative spectral distortions obtained at three experimental sites. With a baseline longer than that of Bugey-3, Daya Bay was sensitive to the sterile neutrino mixing parameter sin 2 2\u03b8 14 at smaller \u2206m 2 41 values. Similar to that of Bugey-3, no oscillation signature attributable to an additional sterile neutrino was found, and exclusion contours were set in Refs. [181,182] using the Feldman-Cousins [192] and CL s [193,194] approaches. Figure 17 shows the combined results of Daya Bay and Bugey-3 [187] using the Gaussian CL s method [195]. The exclusion contour combining both experiments covered about 5 orders of magnitude in \u2206m 2 41 . This result was further combined with results from the MINOS experiment [196] to constrain the anomalous (anti-)\u03bd \u00b5 \u2192(anti-)\u03bd e oscillation [187] using the CL s method [193,194,197]. As shown in Fig. 18, the combined result from Daya Bay, Bugey-3, and MINOS excluded most of regions allowed by LSND and MiniBooNE. Together with the search results from the IceCube experiment using the matter effect [198], this result significantly reduced the allowed parameter space for future searches.",

The active core size was 3.1 m in diameter and 3.8 m in height. In this experiment, the search was performed with 1 ton of 0.5% Gd-loaded LS at a distance of about 24 m from the reactor core. The LS was contained in a horizontal cylindrical stainlesssteel tank of 103 cm in diameter and 121 cm in length. Each end of the target vessel was exposed to 19 8-inch PMTs that were packed inside mineral oil. The energy response of the NEOS detectors was calibrated with various radioactive sources. The energy resolution was measured to be about 5% at 1 MeV. With 20-m m.w.e. overburden and active muon veto counters made from 5-cm thick plastic scintillators surrounding the detector, NEOS achieved a 22:1 signalto-background ratio after all cuts.",

            "text": "With a single detector, NEOS relied on external constraints on the neutrino spectrum to search for spectral distortion. In comparison with the neutrino spectrum measured from the Daya Bay experiment [199], NEOS observed no significant spectral distortion caused by oscillation, and the exclusion limit was set using the raster-scan method [188]. As shown in Fig. 19, stringent exclusion limits were set in the mass range of 0.2 eV 2 < \u2206m 2 41 < 3 eV 2 . A new generation of very-short-baseline reactor neutrino experiments to search for an eV-massscale sterile neutrino are under construction or in operation. Table 6 summarizes the major parameters of these experiments. The primary challenges for these experiments include the cosmogenic backgrounds resulting from the limited amount of overburden, and reactor-related backgrounds caused by the proximity of the detector to the reactor core. A segmented detector design is generally required to achieve a desired signalto-noise ratio.",

[199]. The rate is corrected for three-flavor neutrino oscillation at each baseline. The blue shaded region represents the global average and its 1\u03c3 uncertainty.  Figure 21. Predicted and measured prompt-energy spectra, taken from Ref. [199]. The prediction is based on the Huber-Mueller model [47,217] and normalized to the number of measured events. The highest energy bin contains all events above 7 MeV. The gray hatched and red filled bands represent the square-root of diagonal elements of the covariance matrix for the reactor-related and the full (reactor, detector, and background) systematic uncertainties, respectively. The error bars on the data points represent the statistical uncertainty. The ratio of the measured prompt-energy spectrum to the predicted spectrum (Huber-Mueller model) is shown in the middle panel. The blue curve shows the ratio of the prediction based on the ILL+Vogel [52,56,57,58]  The calculated deficit cannot be explained by the quoted uncertainties of the reactor flux model [46,47], which is around 2%. One potential explanation of this deficit is the existence of a sterile neutrino with its corresponding mass eigenstate heavier than or equal to \u223c1 eV. Recently, the foundation of this explanation was challenged by authors of Ref. [61], who carefully examined the flux spectrum calculation and concluded that the uncertainties of the flux calculation should be larger than 5%. Their conclusion was supported by the recent measurements of the reactor neutrino energy spectrum from the Daya Bay [199], RENO [138], Double Chooz [142], and NEOS [183] experiments. Figure 21 shows the measured prompt energy spectrum from Daya Bay [199] in comparison with the model prediction and its associated uncertainties.",

In this section, we discuss examples of other searches for new effects, including the search for the neutrino magnetic moment, the attempt to constrain characteristics of the wave-packet approach for neutrino oscillation, the test of the Leggett-Garg inequality, and the search for the breaking of Lorentz and CPT invariance.

Therefore, the most sensitive direct limit, \u00b5 \u03bd < 3.2\u00d710 \u221211 \u00b5 B , came from high-purity germanium detectors at about a 10-keV threshold [236,237,238]. The \u00b5 \u03bd contribution at the present limit are still orders of magnitude higher than the standard model prediction. Other technologies, such as time projection chamber [67], organic scintillator [65], and scintillating crystal [49], were also used to set direct limits on \u00b5 \u03bd . A relaxed indirect limit on \u00b5 \u03bd was set by KamLAND's search for solar\u03bd e [239]. In addition, limits on r 2 \u03bde were set at a few times 10 \u221232 cm 2 [49,65].

While successful in describing many neutrino oscillation results, the planewave approach can lead to apparent paradoxes [240,241]. The necessity of a wave-packet treatment for neutrino oscillation has been considered since the 1970s [242,243]. The wave-packet models of neutrino oscillation contain a quantity \u03c3 p that effectively describes the momentum dispersions of all particles involved in the production and detection of neutrinos. A consequence of a non-zero value of \u03c3 p is the 'decoherence' of the quantum superposition of mass eigenstates, leading to a modification or diminishing of the neutrino oscillation pattern. Moreover, the width of the wave packet would also broaden as time elapses, as a result of the momentum dispersion. Despite many theoretical advances in formulating the wave packet models, within quantum mechanical or field-theoretical approaches, no quantitative estimates for \u03c3 p or the related spatial width \u03c3",

Similarly, an infinite \u03c3 p gives zero coherence and dispersion lengths, preventing any interference effects.

As an example, consider the case of reactor neutrino oscillation with an electron antineutrino at t = 0. If at time t, a measurement finds an electron antineutrino, then Q = +1. Otherwise, Q = \u22121. The key idea is to mimic a series of measurements at various times on a single neutrino by measurements made on an ensemble of neutrinos of various energies at a given time. Details of this method can be found in Refs. [253,254]. One unique feature of this method is the long coherence length for neutrino oscillation, unlike other LGI tests involving much shorter coherence lengths. This method is also free from the 'clumsiness loophole'. Using the MINOS muon neutrino oscillation data at a baseline of 735 km, the LGI for K 3 and K 4 was found to be violated at a level greater than 6\u03c3 [254].

The expressions for the parameters A s,c , B s,c , and C consist of the Lorentz-violating coefficients introduced in Eq. (35). Expressions analogous to Eq. (36) can be obtained for oscillations involving other neutrino flavors. For reactor neutrino disappearance experiments, the probability P\u03bd e \u2192\u03bde is simply P\u03bd e \u2192\u03bde = 1 \u2212 P\u03bd e\u2192\u03bd\u00b5 \u2212 P\u03bd e \u2192\u03bd\u03c4 .

No evidence for Lorentz violating sidereal modulations has been found, setting upper limits on various coefficients in Eq. (35). Combining the analysis of MINOS neardetector (ND) data on \u03bd \u00b5 and\u03bd \u00b5 disappearance and far-detector (FD) data on \u03bd \u00b5 disappearance, limits on both the real and imaginary parts of 18 Lorentzviolating coefficients have been obtained [266]. Effects of the a L -type (c L -type) coefficients are proportional to L 2 and (E \u03bd L) 2 , accounting for the greater sensitivities of the FD data [265] for constraining some coefficients, despite its lower event rates compared with the ND data [264].

The absolute reactor flux and energy spectrum can now be predicted at the 5% and 10% level, respectively. Inverse beta decay, the primary detection channel of reactor neutrinos, is the most well-understood reaction, allowing for an accurate determination of neutrino energy. Benefiting from these important features, reactor neutrinos have played important roles in establishing the current paradigm of three-neutrino flavor mixing.",

The simultaneously measured oscillation caused by (\u03b8 12 , \u2206m 2 21 ) and (\u03b8 13 , \u2206m 2 32 ) will allow a determination of the neutrino mass hierarchy and a precision measurement of these mixing parameters. On the other hand, a new generation of very-short-baseline reactor experiments will search for a light sterile neutrino. These new measurements together with those using other neutrino sources are expected to explore possible new physics beyond the standard model. As we enter the precision era of neutrino physics, reactor neutrinos might yet lead to other unexpected major discoveries.",
