The dataset corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 0.37 fb \u22121 collected with the LHCb detector. The measurement is presented as a function of transverse momentum, p T , and rapidity, y, of the J /\u03c8 meson, in the kinematic region 2 < p T < 15 GeV/c and 2.0 < y < 4.5.",

            "text": "Studies of J /\u03c8 production in hadronic collisions provide powerful tests of QCD. In pp collisions, quarkonium resonances can be produced directly, through feed-down from higher quarkonium states (such as the \u03c8(2S) or \u03c7 c resonances [1]), or via the decay of b hadrons. The first two production mechanisms are generically referred to as prompt production. The mechanism for prompt production is not yet fully understood and none of the available models adequately predicts the observed dependence of the J /\u03c8 production cross-section and polarization on its transverse momentum p T [1]. This paper describes the measurement of the polarization of the prompt J /\u03c8 component in pp collisions at \u221a s = 7 TeV, using the dimuon decay mode. The measured polarization is subsequently used to update the LHCb measurement of the cross-section given in Ref. [2]. This improves the precision of the cross-section measurement significantly as the polarization and overall reconstruction efficiency are highly correlated.",

The natural polarization axis for the measurement is that where the lepton azimuthal angle distribution is symmetric (\u03bb \u03c6 = \u03bb \u03b8\u03c6 = 0) and \u03bb \u03b8 is maximal [7]. Several theoretical models are used to describe quarkonium production, predicting the values and the kinematic dependence of the cross-section and polarization. The colorsinglet model (CSM) at leading order [8,9] underestimates the J /\u03c8 production cross-section by two orders of magnitude [2,10] and predicts significant transverse polarization. Subsequent calculations at next-to-leading order and at next-to-next-to-leading order change these predictions dramatically. The cross-section prediction comes close to the observed values and the polarization is expected to be large and longitudinal [11][12][13][14]. Calculations performed in the framework of non-relativistic quantum chromodynamics (NRQCD), where the cc pair can be produced in color-octet states (color-octet model, COM [15][16][17]), can explain the shape and magnitude of the measured crosssection as a function of p T . COM predicts a dependence of the J /\u03c8 polarization on the p T of the J /\u03c8 meson. In the low p T region (p T < M(J /\u03c8)/c with M(J /\u03c8) the mass of the J /\u03c8 meson), where the gluon fusion process dominates, a small longitudinal polarization is expected [18]. For p T M(J /\u03c8), where gluon fragmentation dominates, the leading order predictions [19,20] and next-to-leading order calculations [21] suggest a large transverse component of the J /\u03c8 polarization.",

The CDF experiment, in pp collisions at \u221a s = 1.96 TeV, measured a small longitudinal J /\u03c8 polarization, going to zero at small p T . This measurement is in disagreement with the COM calculations and does not support the conclusion that the color-octet terms dominate the J /\u03c8 production in the high p T region. The PHENIX experiment measured the J /\u03c8 polarization in pp collisions at \u221a s = 200 GeV, for p T < 3 GeV/c. The HERA-B experiment studied J /\u03c8 polarization in 920 GeV/c fixed target proton-nucleus (p-C and p-W ) collisions. The explored kinematic region is defined for p T < 5.4 GeV/c and Feynman variable x F between \u22120.34 and 0.14. Also in these cases a small longitudinal polarization is observed. Recently, at the LHC, ALICE [25] and CMS [26] have measured the J /\u03c8 polarization in pp collisions at \u221a s = 7 TeV, in the kinematic ranges of 2 < p T < 8 GeV/c, 2.5 < y < 4.0, and 14 < p T < 70 GeV/c, |y| < 1.2, respectively.

A righthanded Cartesian coordinate system is used, centred on the nominal pp collision point with z pointing downstream along the nominal beam axis and y pointing upwards. The detector includes a high precision tracking system consisting of a silicon-strip vertex detector surrounding the pp interaction region, a large-area silicon-strip detector located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4 Tm, and three stations of silicon-strip detectors and straw drift tubes placed downstream. The combined tracking system provides momentum measurement with relative uncertainty that varies from 0.4 % at 5 GeV/c to 0.6 % at 100 GeV/c, and impact parameter resolution of 20 \u00b5m for tracks with high p T . Charged hadrons are identified using two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors. Photon, electron and hadron candidates are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad and pre-shower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter and a hadronic calorimeter. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers [28].",

Candidate events are selected by the hardware trigger requiring the p T of one muon to be larger than 1.48 GeV/c, or the products of the p T of the two muons to be larger than 1.68 (GeV/c) 2 . In the subsequent software trigger [29], two tracks with p T > 0.5 GeV/c and momentum p > 6 GeV/c are required to be identified as muons and the invariant mass of the two muon tracks is required to be within \u00b1120 MeV/c 2 of the nominal mass of the J /\u03c8 meson [30].

The weighting factor w i is chosen to be +1 (\u22121) if a candidate falls in the signal region (sideband regions) shown in Fig. 1. In this way the background component in the signal window is subtracted on a statistical basis. 2 For this procedure it is assumed that the angular distribution (cos \u03b8, \u03c6) of background events in the signal region is similar to that of the events in sideband regions, and that the mass distribution of the background is approximately linear. The method used for the measurement of the polarization is tested by measuring the J /\u03c8 polarization in two simulated samples with a fully transverse and fully longitudinal polarization, respectively. In both cases the results reproduce the simulation input within the statistical sensitivity.",

To propagate these uncertainties to the polarization results, the following procedure is used. For each muon (p T , y) bin, the weight is changed by one standard deviation, leaving all other weights at their nominal values. This new set of weights is used to redetermine the detector efficiency and then perform a new fit of the polarization parameters. The difference of the obtained parameters with respect to the nominal polarization result is considered as the contribution of this muon (p T , y) bin to the uncertainty.
