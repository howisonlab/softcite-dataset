While IceCube is capable of monitoring the whole sky continuously, high-energy gamma-ray telescopes have restricted fields of view and in general are unlikely to be observing a potential neutrino-flaring source at the time such neutrinos are recorded. The use of neutrino-triggered alerts thus aims at increasing the availability of simultaneous multi-messenger data during potential neutrino flaring activity, which can increase the discovery potential and constrain the phenomenological interpretation of the high-energy emission of selected source classes (e.g. blazars). The requirements of a fast and stable online analysis of potential neutrino signals and its operation are presented, along with first results of the program operating between 14 March 2012 and 31 December 2015.",

            "text": "see [1]). For neutrinos in the TeV range, prime source candidates are Galactic supernova remnants [2]. Neutrinos in the PeV range and above are suspected to be produced by active galactic nuclei (AGN) and gamma ray bursts (GRB) with many AGN models predicting a significant neutrino flux [3][4][5]. However, the recent results from the IceCube Collaboration strongly disfavor GRBs as sources of the highest energy cosmic rays [6]. Recently, the IceCube Collaboration has also reported the first observation of a cosmic diffuse neutrino flux which lies in the 100 TeV to PeV range [7]. Individual neutrino sources, however, could not be identified up to now. While many astrophysical sources of origin have been suggested [8], there is not yet enough information to narrow down the possibilities to any particular source or source class. Gamma-ray observations by imaging atmospheric-Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs) such as VER-ITAS [9], HESS [10] or MAGIC [11] have also a potential to find hadronic \u03b3-rays from the neutrino directions and to identify neutrino sources [12,13]. The expected neutrino flux from observed high-energy gamma-ray fluxes of blazars in their brightest states (e.g. the flares of Markarian 501 in 1997 [17] and 2005 [18], Markarian 421 in 2000/2001 [19] and 2008 [20] and PKS 2155-304 in 2006 [21]) can be at the level of the neutrino flux detected by the high-energy neutrino telescopes [14][15][16].",

            "text": "For sources which manifest large time variations in the emitted electromagnetic radiation, the signal-to-noise ratio can be increased by searching for periods of enhanced neutrino emission (a time-dependent search). Of special interest is the relation of these periods of enhanced neutrino emission with periods of strong high-energy gamma-ray emission. However, IACTs have a duty cycle limited to the clear, dark nights (roughly 10% of total time), such correlation studies are not always possible after the neutrino flare has occurred. Therefore, it is desirable to ensure the availability of simultaneous neutrino and high-energy gamma-ray data for periods of interest. This can be achieved by an online neutrino flare search that alerts the partner IACT experiments when an elevated rate of neutrino events from the direction of a source candidate is detected. Such a Neutrino Triggered Target of Opportunity program (NToO), using a list of pre-defined sources, has been developed and has been operating since 2006 using the AMANDA neutrino telescope to initiate gamma-ray follow-up observations by MAGIC [24,25].",

These sources are most accessible in X-ray and optical wavelengths, where one can observe the GRB afterglow or the rising SN light curve, respectively. Similarly to IACTs, the field of view and observation time of X-ray and optical telescopes are limited. Since identification of a GRB or SN is only possible within a certain time range (a few hours after a GRB and a few weeks after a SN explosion), it is important to obtain electromagnetic data within these time frames. To accomplish this, a NToO program triggering optical and X-ray follow-up of short neutrino transients has been operating since 2008 [29,30]. Upon observing multiplets of neutrino candidates (at least two within 100 seconds and within 3.5 \u2022 (angular resolution), from any direction) alerts are sent to the Robotic Optical Transient Search Experiment (ROTSE) [31]1 and the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) [32] for optical observations, and to Swift [33,34] for X-ray follow-up, depending on the multiplet's significance.",

The program is based on a multi-step neutrino selection that is applied online at the South Pole. An alert is sent to the partner telescopes MAGIC and VERITAS in the case that a statistically significant cluster of neutrinos is observed from any of the monitored sources. If the source were to be found in an enhanced flux state by the IACT follow-up observation, the combination of the neutrino observation and the very high-energy gamma-observation could help to establish the discovery of neutrino point sources.

The blazar SED features two distinctive peaks: a low-energy peak between IR and X-ray energies, attributed to synchrotron emission of energetic electrons, and a high-energy peak at gamma-ray energies, which can be explained by several and possibly competing interaction and radiation processes of high-energy electrons and high-energy nuclei [42]. It has been suggested that blazar SED follow a sequence [43][44][45] in which the peak energy of the synchrotron emission spectrum decreases with increasing blazar luminosity. Accordingly, blazars can be classified into low synchrotron peak (LSP), intermediate synchrotron peak (ISP) and high synchrotron peak (HSP) objects, a classication scheme introduced in [46]. A second classifier is based on the prominence of emission lines in the SED over the non-thermal continuum emission of the jet. FSRQs show Doppler-broadened optical emission lines [47], while in the BL Lac objects the emission lines do not exist, or are hidden in a strong continuum emission.",

A common feature of several models is that the class of high-energy peaked HSP is expected to have lower gamma luminosity as compared to low-energy peaked LSP and FSRQs, if the observed high-energy gamma-ray emission is largely the result of interactions of protons with ambient or self-produced radiation. With high target matter density, the neutrino yield can be highest when the very high-energy gamma-ray emission is strongly attenuated by internal absorption (although the cutoff energy is somewhat uncertain). In the case of pp-dominated scenarios, the conclusions are different [4], favoring LSP to FSRQs. In all cases, the availability of simultaneous information on high-energy gamma-ray emission and neutrinos is crucial for distinguishing between different production models.",

As the computing resources at the South Pole are limited, different types of software triggers are applied to lower the data event rate. The most important for the purposes of this work is the Simple Multiplicity Trigger (SMT8) which requires eight triggered optical modules (i.e. four coincidence pairs) anywhere in the detector within 5 \u00b5s. Most of the events which are selected by this trigger are composed of muons produced by cosmic rays in the atmosphere above the detector (about 2.5 kHz at trigger level in the 86-string configuration). As the data volume produced at trigger level is still too large to be transferred via satellite, a first selection has to be applied directly at the South Pole by using the so-called Muon Filter. This filter aims to select well-reconstructed muon tracks of any direction, i.e. from the full sky. The event selection takes place in several steps, called \"levels\" in IceCube. The Muon Filter constitutes the first filtering level. It is a standard IceCube filter and not specific to the program presented here. The subsequent Online Level 2 Filter is based on the input from the Muon Filter and was specifically developed to enable online analyses. Currently the Online Level 2 Filter forms the basis of the optical and X-ray follow-up program and the NToO system presented in this work. Based on cut variables calculated from the Online Level 2 Filter, an online neutrino event selection was implemented. The main goal is to achieve a high efficiency for valid neutrino events with the highest possible rejection of background.",

In order to apply further cuts with a high signal efficiency, more elaborate reconstructions with an improved angular resolution are needed. As an example, the multi-photoelectron (MPE) likelihood function, which uses the temporal and amplitude information of the PMT pulses, is applied after several iterations of SPE likelihood fit. The MPE algorithm includes a probability distribution function (PDF) that describes the scattering of photons in the ice, and is fully described in [57]. Further reconstructions that estimate the angular reconstruction uncertainty are also helpful for subsequent analyses. This combination of additional reconstruction and event-selection cuts is referred to as the Online Level 2 Filter. The SPE fit used as an input to the Muon Filter has limited angular resolution compared to an MPE fit. During the first season of running the IceCube in its full 86-string configuration (IC-2011), the limited CPU resources at the South Pole prohibited applying more resource-intensive reconstructions to all events that passed the Muon Filter. Therefore, it was necessary to apply event-selection cuts to the events passing the Muon Filter before additional reconstruction could be performed. The computing resources at the South Pole were expanded prior to the second full season of IceCube in its 86-string configuration (IC-2012). This expansion made it possible to run some reconstruction (a double-iteration SPE fit and the MPE fit) before applying the Online Level 2 cuts.",

As this can only be determined on an event-by-event basis with simulated data, an estimate has to be used for experimental data. Two different approaches are applied in IceCube: the Paraboloid fit and the Cram\u00e9r-Rao Resolution Estimate. The Paraboloid fit scans the likelihood space around the minimum determined in the track fit by varying the fit parameters. The resulting points in likelihood space are fitted with a parabola [52]. Due to the repeated evaluation of the likelihood function this method can be too slow to be used in the online filtering, especially for high-energy events with a large number of hit DOMs. The Cram\u00e9r-Rao Resolution Estimate is the uncertainty on the reconstructed track direction given by the log-likelihood-based track reconstruction estimated by a method based on the Cram\u00e9r-Rao inequality [53]. As the calculation involves no minimization of a likelihood it is considerably faster (and have a similar performance) than the Paraboloid fit and thus is the preferred method to be used in online analysis, also in NToO. Since the likelihood used in the track fit fully describes the Cherenkov light emission and propagation, both angular uncertainty estimates, the Paraboloid fit and the Cram\u00e9r-Rao method, show an energy-dependent bias in the ratios of the estimated to the true angular uncertainty.

N obs must be reduced by one to take into account the bias introduced by the fact that the background is measured in the time window defined by the j th event. Most very high energy flares detected so far have a duration up to several days, thus we constrain our search for time clusters of neutrinos to 21 days so as to minimize the statistical trial factor penalty. The probability p obs is often expressed in terms of the distance to the center of a normal distribution measured in units of standard deviations that results in the same cumulative probability in the right tail (e.g. a probability of log 10 (p obs ) = \u22122.87 is often quoted as 3 \u03c3). If the cluster with the highest significance exceeds a certain threshold (e.g. corresponding to 3 \u03c3) the detector stability is first checked and, if appropriate, an alert is sent to a partner experiment (atmospheric-Cherenkov telescope) to initiate a follow-up observation.",

Therefore, the expected number of background events in a time window for a source at a certain right ascension depends on the azimuth-angle range covered during that time. This natural azimuth dependence  is reinforced by cut variables that favour events that pass close to many strings (e.g. direct hits and direct length). For time-integrated point-source searches, the azimuth dependence is usually neglected because it is smoothed in right ascension by the rotation of the Earth over long integration times. However, in a time-dependent analysis the azimuth dependence becomes important for timescales shorter than t i \u2212 t j < 2 days. The stable uptime between t i, j up in a time window [t i , t j ] is calculated using the online detector stability monitoring (described in section 6) and combined with information about the start and stop times of the data-taking runs.  The number of accidental background alerts also needs to be estimated in order to calculate the total significance of all the alerts generated by the program, as well as to set sensible alert thresholds such that the partner observatory is not overwhelmed by follow-up requests. The number of follow-up requests allowed in a given time period is fixed by the Time Allocation Committees of the partner experiments. of the alert significance threshold. For a threshold of 3.2 \u03c3 (MAGIC) this would result in a fake alert rate of about 0.1 alerts/(source \u2022 year). Thus, given the number of sources (around 70) in this program for the MAGIC experiment this results in about 3 background alerts per year.8 This number is calculated taking into account that a source is on average visible with a probability of 40% by a partner observatory (i.e. if the source rises at least 30 degrees above the horizon for at least 30 minutes during dark time, the current phase of the Moon is less than 0.5 and the source distance to the Moon is larger than 60 \u2022 ).

Long delays between the detection of the events and the arrival of the test alerts in the North can be a sign of problems with the data processing, the stability-monitoring database or the transfer of test alerts to the North.  Figure 12 shows some of the quantities derived from the test alerts which allow the alert system to be monitored. An important quantity to monitor is the rate of received test alerts ( figure 12(a)). The regular arrival of test alerts in the North is used as a \"heartbeat\" for the overall system. If no test alert is received for more than six hours, a warning email is issued to a list of people so that the cause can be investigated. Warning emails are reissued every two hours if no new alert has been received in the meantime. This threshold of six hours for warning emails is rather conservative, as can be seen in figure 12(b). This figure shows the histogram of the wait times between subsequent test alerts. It follows the expected exponential distribution reasonably well. A time difference of six hours is well within the range of expected waiting times. However, to enable timely interventions, an early warning is preferred. Figure 12 ",

In March 2012, the most significant alert during the first three years of operation of the optical and X-ray follow-up program was issued by IceCube.

Observables specifying the geometry 2016 JINST 11 P11009  and time evolution of the hit pattern, as well as the quality and consistency of the various track reconstructions and the number of strings with signals are used. The BDT training was done with simulated signal events for a soft neutrino spectrum of E \u22122.7 and for an E \u22122 spectrum. As an example, figure 14 depicts results of the BDT training for an E \u22122 spectrum. A set of real data provided the background sample for training. Additionally, for the simulated signal, the reconstructed track was required to be within of 5 \u2022 of the simulated direction in order to train the BDTs with only well-reconstructed events. The final selection cut on the BDT output variable was optimized to provide the best discovery potential for an E \u22122 neutrino flux, which results in a BDT score value of 0.106. This final cut leads to a rate of 2 mHz for the final sample and, as shown in table 5, to a better signal efficiency (with respect to Online Level 2 Filter efficiency) than the original NToO cuts. The BDT-based event selection leads to an improvement in the signal efficiency of about +12(+18)% for an E \u22122 (E \u22122.7 ) spectrum with respect to the simple cuts. The BDT selection was also used for the Southern Hemisphere (zenith angle \u03b8 < 90 \u2022 ). However, instead of a single BDT-score cut value, a zenith-dependent cut was applied in order to select a constant number of events per solid angle, as shown in figure 14 (Lower panel). This zenith-dependent cut was also optimized with respect to sensitivity and discovery potential for an E \u22122 neutrino spectrum. The optimized cut described by a polynomial fit (figure 14 (Lower panel)) leads to a total data rate of 2.1 mHz for the South only and an average signal efficiency of about 45 % (with respect to the Online Level 2 Filter), see also table 5.",

An important goal of this program was to establish and to test procedures to trigger promptly the gamma-ray community to collect sensitive VHE data from specific sources during periods of time when IceCube measures a potential increase in their neutrino flux. These periods of elevated emission (\"flares\"), both in gamma rays and neutrinos, are of particular interest to identify the sources of astrophysical neutrinos, and to understand the source emission mechanisms. The second goal of the NToO is to increase the discovery potential for time-variable point-sources of neutrinos with IceCube. The detection of a high-energy gamma-ray flare with an IACT triggered by an alert from IceCube can help to establish the neutrino signal, even if it is not significant enough on its own to qualify as a discovery. The NToO is the first online analysis in IceCube searching for neutrino flares from point sources on time scales longer than a few minutes. We have shown that such an analysis can be done efficiently and reliably, and presented the first results from this program. Table 6. List of sources used by NToO from November 2013 to December 2015. In the table the source name, the declination (DEC), the right ascension (RA), search bin radius, and threshold for sending alerts is listed. The last column indicates if the source belongs only to the MAGIC list or VERITAS list or if the source is present in the list for both experiments (BOTH). ",

If no test alert is received for more than six hours, a warning email is issued to a list of people so that the cause can be investigated.

This figure shows the histogram of the wait times between subsequent test alerts. It follows the expected exponential distribution reasonably well.

For neutrinos very close to the horizon (0 \u2022 \u2264 \u03b4 \u2264 10 \u2022 ) and for neutrino energies greater than 10 8 GeV the effective area can reach 10 4 m 2 .The efficiency of the event-selection cuts with respect to the Online Level 2 Filter is depicted in figure 4 for all events (dashed) and for events that have been reconstructed within angle \u2206\u03a8 < 3 \u2022 of their true direction. Well-reconstructed events are selected with an efficiency of more than 60 % above 1 TeV; while the overall peak efficiency of about 80 % is reached between 100 TeV and 10 PeV.As we already mentioned above, the main selection cuts are optimized for a neutrino power-law spectrum with a spectral index \u03b3 = 2 . However, several Galactic gamma-ray sources have energy spectra with energy cutoffs at a few TeV[74], supporting the idea that Galactic neutrino spectra may present cutoff spectra as well[75,76]. Also, recent IceCube results show that the astrophysical neutrino flux has a neutrino spectrum softer than E \u22122 . The IceCube neutrino flux can be well described by an unbroken power law with best-fit spectral index 2.50 \u00b1 0.09[70].7IceCube is located at the South Pole, so the relation between zenith angle and declination is given by simply transformation: \u03b8 = \u03b4 + 90 \u2022 .",
