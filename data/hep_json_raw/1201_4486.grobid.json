The latter is described by parton density functions (PDFs). A PDF, f i (x, Q 2 ), represents the probability of finding in the proton a parton i (quark or gluon) carrying a fraction x of the proton momentum with Q being the energy scale of the hard interaction. In case of proton-(anti)proton interactions PDFs of both protons enter multiplicatively into the calculation of the process cross section. Therefore the precision of the PDFs is of particular importance for accurate cross-section predictions. In the last decades, the measurements of lepton-nucleon and proton-antiproton scattering have been used to determine the proton PDFs. At low to medium x the PDFs are constrained by HERA data. The measurements at fixed target experiments and Tevatron contribute mainly at high x. The recent precise data from Tevatron and the LHC experiments have the potential to improve the precision on the PDFs further.",

The structure functions, and in turn the PDFs, depend on x and Q. The x-dependence of the parton distributions is not yet calculable in pQCD and has to be parametrized at a certain starting scale Q 0 . The dependence on Q is described by the DGLAP evolution equations [1]. Starting from a parameterisation of the PDFs at a starting scale, either by making ad-hoc assumptions on their analytical form or by using the neural-net technology, fits to various sets of experimental data, with HERA DIS data being the backbone, are performed within the DGLAP evolution scheme. The resulting PDFs depend on the order in which the perturbative QCD calculation is performed, the assumptions about the PDF parametrization, the treatment of heavy quarks, the choice for the value of \u03b1 s (M Z ) and the treatment of the uncertainties. The data sets included in the PDF fit and the consistency of these data sets determines the experimental uncertainty of the PDFs. The parton distributions HERAPDF [2] are determined using only combined HERA DIS data, where the correlations of the systematic uncertainties are properly taken into account. This allows the usage of the conventional \u03c7 2 tolerance of \u2206\u03c7 2 = 1. Since this QCD analysis is solely based on ep data, the PDFs do not depend on the approach for nuclear corrections needed for fixed target data. Several phenomenological schemes of heavy quark treatment can be used in the HERAPDF approach. Therefore direct tests of the models are possible. The full statistics of the HERA inclusive CC and NC data are used for NLO and NNLO QCD fits resulting in HERAPDF1. 5 [3]. As an example, the combined NC cross sections are shown in Fig. 2 together with QCD prediction based on HERAPDF1.5NLO.",

The QCD predictions for the structure functions are obtained by the convolution of the PDFs with the NLO coefficient functions calculated using the general mass variable flavour number RT scheme [4].

In addition to the experimental uncertainties, the variation of model inputs and parametrisation in the determination of HERAPDF are performed and provided as additional eigenvectors. The model uncertainties are evaluated by varying the input assumptions on minimum Q 2 of the data used in the fit, the strangeness fraction and the masses of heavy quarks. The parametrisation uncertainty is formed by an envelope of the maximal deviations from the central fit varying parametrisation assumptions.

The large number of PDF parameters and their treatment in the fitting procedure within the different groups results in differences of the PDFs provided. In order to study these differences, a benchmarking exercise is being carried out by the PDF4LHC working group [23] formed by the members of the PDF fitting groups mentioned above. As an example, the NLO prediction for the Higgs cross section (M H = 120 GeV) at the LHC is shown in Fig. 8 for different PDF sets as a function of \u03b1 S (M Z ). For different PDF groups not only the value of \u03b1 S (M Z ), but also the running of the strong coupling is different, resulting in different cross section predictions. The HERAPDF is an ac- tive participant in the benchmarking exercise. In contrast to other PDF groups, HERAPDF is not restricted to one particular heavy flavour treatment scheme, several schemes are implemented and can be tested. Also, by providing the PDF eigenvectors for model parameter and parametrization variations, HERAPDF allows for tests of specific parameterisation and model assumptions during the QCD analysis of different data sets. In the following, the inclusion of semi-inclusive DIS data in the QCD analysis HERAPDF and the impact of these data on assumptions on \u03b1 S (M Z ) and the charm quark mass value in the PDF fit is discussed.",

In Fig. 10 the quality of the PDF fit in terms of \u03c7 2 is represented as a function of the assumption on the value of \u03b1 S (M Z ). In case of HERAPDF1.5, where only inclusive data are used, a very shallow minimum in the \u03c7 2 distribution is observed. The inclusion of the jet measurements in the fit results in the clear minimum, which allows the simultaneous determination of the PDFs and \u03b1 S (M Z ).

This result is in very good agreement with different results of \u03b1 S determination at HERA and with the world average as shown in Fig. 11. It is important to note, that the dominant uncertainty arises from the variation of the renormalization and factorisation scales in the NLO calculation for the jet cross sections.

Therefore, the treatment of heavy quarks and the assumptions on their masses have particular importance in the QCD analysis of the proton structure. Different approaches to treat heavy quark (heavy quark schemes) are used by different PDF fitting groups, corresponding to different treatment of mass terms in perturbative calculations, but also implying differences in the interpretation and assumptions on the values of the heavy quark masses. Measurements of charm and beauty production can help constraining some of these assumptions.

The proton PDFs are determined using the experimental data of DIS and proton-proton collisions. Combined data of HERA collider experiments provide the most precise constraint on the PDFs at small and medium x. HERAPDF is one of the modern QCD analyses in which PDFs are determined. The advantages of these PDFs is no need for nuclear corrections (in contrast to PDFs using the fixed target data), consistent treatment of the systematic uncertainties of the experimental data and implementation of several phenomenological approaches of heavy flavour treatment. Currently, HERAPDF1.5 at NLO and NNLO are among the recommended parton densities for predictions of LHC cross sections. Recent developments in the HERAPDF fits include the QCD analyses of HERA inclusive DIS data together with jet and charm measurements. The inclusion of the jet measurements in the HERAPDF analysis reduces the correlation between the gluon distribution and the strong coupling constant. In such a fit, the PDF is determined together with the \u03b1 S (M Z ) value. The resulting \u03b1 S (M Z ) value is in a very good agreement with the world average and its precision is limited by the missing NNLO calculation for jet production. The inclusion of the charm data reduces the correlation between the gluon density and the value of the charm mass used in different schemes of heavy flavour treatment in the PDF fit. In particular, a proper choice of the charm quark mass value is important for accurate QCD predictions of W and Z boson rates at the LHC. The QCD predictions based on the HERAPDF1.5 describe the measurements at Tevatron and the LHC very well. With increasing precision of the LHC data, particular processes like W-boson, jet or top-pair production will provide additional constraints on the PDFs.",
