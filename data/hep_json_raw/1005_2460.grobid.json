The current theory of elementary particle physics, the Standard Model, contains twelve different types of fermions which (neglecting gravity) interact through the gauge bosons of three forces [1,2,3,4]. In addition a scalar particle, the Higgs boson, is needed for theoretical consistency [5]. These few building blocks explain all experimental results found in the context of particle physics, so far.",

Having the complete set of quarks further allows to verify constraints that the Standard Model puts on the sum of all quarks or particles. This alone is reason enough to experimentally study the top quark properties. The high value of the top quark mass and its closeness to the electroweak scale has inspired people to speculate that the top quark could have a special role in the electroweak symmetry breaking, see e.g. [13,14]. Confirming the expected properties of the top quark experimentally establishes the top quark as we expect it to be. Any deviation from the expectations gives hints to new physics that may help to solve the outstanding questions.",

The SMT consists of a barrel with four layers of single and double sided silicon micro-strip detectors with a total length of about 70 cm. The barrel is separated into six subsections along the beam-pipe. Each subsection is capped with a disk of silicon detectors (Fdisks). Three additional F-disks are placed on each side further outside of the barrel. Larger disks (H-disks) are placed at distances of 100 cm and 121 cm from the beam pipe. The SMT barrel provides excellent r-\u03c6-information, the disks provide r-z as well as r-\u03c6 measurements. During a shutdown period in 2006 the D\u00d8 silicon system was extended by adding an additional layer of sensors directly on top of the beam pipe. This Layer-0 significantly improves the ability of vertex reconstruction. D\u00d8 measurements are usually performed separately for data taken before and after the installation of Layer-0. The two run periods are commonly denoted as Run IIa and Run IIb. Outside the SMT the central fibre tracker (CFT) is placed. It consists of scintillating fibres mounted on eight concentric support cylinders at radial distances between 20 and 52 cm covering |\u03b7| to about 1.7.

At the typical energies in top quark events of 50 to 100 GeV the mean decay length is of the order of 5 mm. This fact is exploited by computing the impact parameter for tracks or by explicitly reconstructing a secondary vertex from the tracks that is displaced from the primary vertex. To identify b-jets CDF uses only tracks that fall within the cone radius of the considered jet. A secondary vertex is reconstructed in two passes with different track requirements [59]. The 2d decay length is computed as the distance of primary to the secondary vertex. The significance, i.e. the decay length over its uncertainty, is required to be larger than 3. If the direction from the primary to the secondary vertex is opposite to the direction of the jet, the tag is called a negative tag. These negative tags are useful to determine the purity of mis-tag rates. In D\u00d8 first track jets are built with a cone algorithm independent of the calorimeter jets described above. Secondary vertices are reconstructed with tracks from a given track jet. Calorimeter jets are considered as identified b-jets, if an identified track jet falls within a radius of \u2206R < 0.5. The most recent D\u00d8 tagging algorithm uses the impact parameters of tracks matched to a given jet and information on the secondary vertex mass, the significance of displacement, and the number of participating tracks for any reconstructed secondary vertex within the cone of the given jet. The information is combined in a neural network to obtain the output variable, NN B , which tends towards one for b-jets and towards zero for light jets [60].",

The results are corrected for any observed shifts and the uncertainties scaled to fit the observed spread of results in the ensemble tests. The observed shifts vary between 1.4 GeV for the Dynamical Likelihood method [93], which relies on this calibration to describe the background effects, and 0.09 GeV for the Matrix Element method [92], which has the most complete background term. As all methods apply an in-situ jet energy calibration this important systematic is already covered by the uncertainty of the fit result. The residual effect of the jet energy scale is estimated by varying the p T and \u03b7 dependence. The uncertainty of the jet energy scale of b-jets from various sources is considered separately. The uncertainty of signal modelling is determined from comparison of Pythia and Herwig and by varying the amount of initial and final state radiation produced in the parton shower. Further uncertainties include an estimate of the background modelling and treatment in each method. The DLM has the uncertainty due to initial and final state radiation as the most important single contribution, while in the MEM and the MTM the residual jet energy scale and the difference between generators used for signal simulation are the two leading contributions.

Eq. (31). Then the a priori Gaussian distribution of the neutrino rapidities are folded into a total weight, W i (m t ), by adding the w(m t , \u03b7 \u03bd , \u03b7\u03bd) at 10 values of the neutrino rapidity with appropriate unequal distance.",

The backgrounds are all described with the matrix element for Z+jets process with Z \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 .

Jet by jet tag rate functions are measured in events with exactly four jets and parameterised as function of the jet transverse energy, the track multiplicity and number of vertices in the event. These jet tag rates are applied to the selected data with six to eight jets, but before requiring b tagged jets. Corrections for the fact that heavy flavour quarks are produced in pairs and for the signal content in the pre-tag samples are applied. This background model was verified on data with the neural network cut inverted. The top quark mass is reconstructed in each selected event by performing a constrained kinematic fit to the six leading jets. The quark energies are allowed to vary within the experimental resolution of the measured jet momenta. The two pairs of light quark momenta are constrained to the W boson mass within the W boson width. The invariant mass of the two triples of quarks from the top and anti-top quark decays are constrained to agree with the top quark mass within the nominal top quark width, which is assumed as \u0393 t = 1.5 GeV. The top quark mass and the quark energies are free parameters of the fit. The corresponding fit \u03c7 2 can thus be written as follows:",

With six jets this still allows thirty permutations for events with one identified b jet and six permutations in presence of two tagged jets. The top quark mass obtained from the jet-parton assignment that yields the lowest \u03c7 2 is used as the reconstructed mass for the event under consideration. To obtain a handle on the jet energy scale, also the W mass is reconstructed in each event. This is done by repeating the above fit with also the W boson mass as a free parameter. Again the jet-parton assignment with the lowest \u03c7 2 is chosen for further analysis. The distribution of these mass values reconstructed in each of the data events is compared to templates for various nominal top quark masses. These templates are constructed by applying the above fitting procedure to events from top quark pair signal simulation for various nominal top quark masses and to the described background background estimate. For the background estimate the reconstructed top quark and W boson masses are entering the distributions with weights computed from the tagging probabilities and the corrections described above. Signal templates are created not only for various top quark mass values but also for a range of jet energy scale shifts, \u2206 JES . To obtain smooth signal templates the distribution obtained at discrete values of the nominal top quark mass and jet energy scale shift are fitted by functional forms. See Fig. 18 for examples of such templates and their parametrisation. Now the results obtained in data are compared to these templates with a likelihood that is maximised with respect to the top quark mass, m t , the jet energy scale shift, \u2206 JES , and the number of signal and background events. The likelihood consists of a term describing the agreement with the W boson mass templates and of terms for the subsamples containing one or more than one b tagged jets, L 1 and L 2 :",

However, this definition usually yields significant higher order corrections. For Monte Carlo simulations the order of the corrections included in the determination cannot be easily computed due to the presence of parton shower cut offs and modelling of hadronisation. Deriving the top quark mass from the top quark crosssection measurements avoids using the simulation for calibration and allows the determination of the top quark mass using a well defined mass definition in an understandable approximation.",

As these numbers refer to the same data, the differences between the results of about \u00b12 GeV has to be attributed to theoretical differences and may be an indication of the sensitivity of the pole-mass definition to higher order corrections. Recently in a first determination of the MS-mass of the top quark has been presented [129]. Based on the data of the same D\u00d8 cross-section result [126] a running top quark mass ofm t = 160.0 \u00b1 3.3 GeV is extracted using the approximate NNLO prediction [34]. To compare this number to the pole mass result quoted above it has to be converted to the pole mass. This conversions strongly depends on the order used. In leading order no change occurs, while using the NNLO formula yields m t = 168.2 \u00b1 3.6 GeV. (For simplicity the slightly asymmetric uncertainties were symmetrised by the author.) It should be noted that the MSmass determined from different orders of the MS crosssection calculation change by less than 1 GeV between leading order and next-to-next-to-leading order, while the corresponding pole mass of the same order changes by nearly 10 GeV.",

Instead the dominating systematic uncertainty in the measurement of the mass difference is that of modeling additional jets in events of top quark pairs. This signal modeling uncertainty is estimated from data and simulation. Using simulation the amount of events with more than four jets is varied to agree with data. In addition, pseudo experiments are performed in which appropriate data events with more than four jet are added to the standard signal simulation with various amounts. In combination D\u00d8 finds an uncertainty of 0.85 GeV due to signal modelling. Because of the necessity to distinguish top from anti-top quarks also the uncertainty in the lepton charge determination and the uncertainty in modelling the differences of the calorimeter response for b and b jets is evaluated. The latter gives a sizable contribution of 0.4 GeV in the D\u00d8 result, but its determination is limited by the statistics of the corresponding simulation.

Also the next dominant uncertainty, the b-jet energy scale, can in principle be determined in situ, however, more statistics is needed to achieve an improvement over the current uncertainty.",

            "text": "These results constrain the Standard Model prediction for processes that involve top quarks either as real particles or in virtual loops. Besides the real production of top quarks, electroweak precision data are sensitive to the value of the top quark mass. Even before the discovery of the top quark the electroweak precision data constrained the top quark mass [138]. Now such indirect values are compared with the direct measurements at the Tevatron to verify the consistency of the Standard Model [90,139]. Implicitly, such comparisons assume that the experimentally measured top quark mass values are given in the pole mass scheme. This assumption, however, is not confirmed to the level of the experimental precision of the combined result from direct top quark mass measurements. Therefore conclusions based on such comparisons need to be drawn with great care. Hopefully, in the future it will be possible to evaluate the exact top quark mass definition used in the Monte Carlos and used in the calibration of top quark mass measurements. Any bias in the current usage of the value can then be corrected for and the quoted experimental uncertainties can be used in these comparisons unchanged. Until the mass definition of the simulations used for calibration can be determined, it will be an important task to develop top quark mass measurements that are based on well defined mass schemes. The LHC has started data taking in 2010 at an initial centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV. First results show a tremendous quality of the data taken by the experiments and top quark pair production was already seen in about 3 pb \u22121 [140,141]. With the planned LHC luminosity of 1 fb \u22121 the LHC experiments will become competitive to the Tevatron experiments within 2011. Systematic uncertainties on the top quark mass using the methods developed essentially at the Tevatron were expected to be below 2 GeV even before the initial data taking [142,143,144]. With the performance shown in the first year of running a result comparable to the current Tevatron result can be expected. The statistical uncertainty in these results will still be noticeable.",

The top quark mass determination involving leptonic J/\u03c8 decays from the b-quark jet [145,146] is expected to be less dependent on the jet energy scale allowing to cross-check the in situ methods. In production with very high transverse top quark momentum the top decay products are clearly separated from the antitop quark decay products.

Requiring that the momenta of the corresponding decay products are compatible with the W boson mass and a top quark mass of 175 GeV and using the missing transverse energy allows to determine the neutrino momenta up to an 8-fold ambiguity. To account for the experimental resolutions this determination is repeated with appropriately smeared input momenta. Of the eight (smeared) solutions the one that yields the smallest invariant tt mass is used. The distribution of measured reconstructed cos \u03b8 * values is compared to templates with a binned likelihood function.

Dilepton events consist of two charged leptons, missing transverse momentum and two jets. Both samples are classified according to the number of jets that are identified as b jets. The background in the lepton plus jets sample is dominated by W +jets events and multijet events with fake electrons. The multijet background is estimated from data using a range of control samples. The W +jets background is simulated using the Alpgen+Herwig generator. In the subsamples with one or more than one identified b-jet, it is normalised using data before b-tagging. The fraction of heavy flavour in these samples is scaled according to the Monte Carlo to data ratio in a control sample of inclusive jet events. For the description of W +jets events without identified b jets, a neural network based on kinematic observables is used, which enriches W +jets background at low values and top quark pair signal at high values. The neural network was trained on Alpgen+Herwig samples.

Background estimation for W +jets and tt production is simulated using Alpgen. Standard Model single top quark production is modelled using Single-Top [191,192]. ulated with a narrow width for the charged Higgs boson using CompHEP. Three types of two Higgs doublet models (2HDM) are considered. In the Type I 2HDM one doublet gives mass to all fermions; in the Type II model one doublet gives mass to the u-type quarks (and neutrinos), the other to the d-type quarks and charged leptons. This model is realised in the MSSM. In the Type III 2HDM both doublets contribute to the masses of all fermions. Due to the different couplings the cross-section of single top quark production in these 3 models is quite different. Standard Model and charged Higgs boson production of single top quarks is separated by reconstructing the invariant mass of the two jets and the W boson. This distribution shows good agreement between data and the Standard Model expectation, see Fig. 46. Bayesian statistics is used to set limits on the allowed cross-section for single top quark production through a charged Higgs boson. For the Type I 2HDM some region in tan \u03b2 vs. M H \u00b1 can be excluded, c.f. Fig. 47, a significant fraction of phase space is not accessible by the analysis in its current form due to the restriction to small H \u00b1 decay widths [249].",

In the fit the final state lepton and quark momenta are determined from the measured lepton momentum, the missing transverse energy (which is assumed to stem from the unseen neutrino) and the measured jet momenta. Constraints are imposed that require the sum of neutrino and lepton momenta as well as the two light quark momenta to be consistent with the W boson mass. In addition these pairs in combination with one b quark need be consistent with the top quark mass of 175 GeV. The fitted momenta may vary within the experimental resolution of their assigned measurement and the mass constraints are varied within the natural widths of the W boson and the top quark, respectively. The fit thus assumes the lepton plus jets decay topology of top quark pair events.

Additional variables were reconstructed by applying a constrained fit. In this fit reconstructed physics objects (lepton, missing transverse energy and jets) are assigned to the decay products of an assumed semileptonic top quark pair event and the measured quantities are allowed to vary within their experimental resolution to fulfil additional constraints. It was required that the W boson mass is consistent with the invariant mass of the jets assigned to the two light quarks as well as with the invariant mass of the lepton with the neutrino. The masses of the reconstructed top quark pairs were constrained to be equal. Of the possible jet parton assignments only the one with the best \u03c7 2 was used. From the constrained fits observables the angle between the bquarks and the beam axis in the bb rest frame, the bb invariant mass, the distances between the b's and the sameside or opposite-side W bosons and the reconstructed top quark mass are considered.

This precision significantly exceeds the precision goals of about 3 GeV of the Tevatron Run II programme set for 2 fb \u22121 [47,277]. Despite the low branching fraction of the dileptonic channel, even results in this channel alone now have achieved an experimental precision exceeding this goal. In order to reach these small uncertainties, it was important to constrain the jet energy scale, leading to the dominating uncertainty, in-situ to data. Unfortunately, the experimental precision on the top quark mass is currently not matched by a corresponding theoretical understanding. The uncertainty of the mass definition used in the simulations that the experiments apply to calibrate their measurements is not known better than to the order of 1 GeV. This complicates the comparison of the top quark mass results, e.g. with other electroweak precision data, and is a fundamental problem also for the LHC programme. Discussions on these issues have started between the experimental, the generator and the theoretical community in order to collect the information needed to overcome this issue. The development of methods that precisely determine the mass in well defined definitions is an important problem in current top quark physics.",

Until then it is expected to increase the total integrated luminosity for the CDF and D\u00d8 experiments to more than 10 fb \u22121 . The analyses of the Tevatron take advantage of several years of optimising the reconstruction of the recorded events. Thus further updates of existing analyses, but also investigation of yet untested properties can be expected. In addition the LHC has started to operate at \u221a s = 7 TeV well above that of the Tevatron centre-of-mass energy. It is expected to deliver an integrated luminosity of at least 1 fb \u22121 throughout 2011. Due to the increased collision energy at the LHC the top production cross-sections are significantly higher than at the Tevatron. With 1 fb \u22121 the LHC experiments will have collected about twice as many top quark pairs and three times as many single top quarks than the Tevatron experiments at 10 fb \u22121 .",

We will thus see a plethora of competitive results from the LHC experiments. Clearly some searches profit from the increased phase space and will be dominated by the LHC. There are also results where the Tevatron has an advantage, like the charge asymmetry and the single top quark W \u2032 search, however, most results will be comparable. Also at the LHC many will be statistically limited which makes it useful to foresee a combination of the results.",

With a top quark pair cross-section which is 100 times higher than at the Tevatron and dominant backgrounds like W +jets and Z+jets increasing only by factors of about 10 the LHC will become a real top quark factory. Again many searches for new particles will profit from the enlarged phase space. Measurements of interaction properties and searches for new particles in top quark decays will become limited by systematics after only a short running at design luminosity. At the same time with the huge expected statistics new types of measurement methods on rare subsamples will become feasible. For the top quark mass methods using leptonic J/\u03c8 decays or using events with very high top quark momentum will have very different experimental and theoretical uncertainties. Such alternative methods with different systematic uncertainties will contribute to the combination of results. And may even help to solve the puzzle of the meaning of the top quark mass.",

            "text": "Beside the Standard Model decays of a top quark through a W boson, four decay modes through the charged Higgs boson are considered: H + \u2192\u03c4 \u03bd, H + \u2192 cs, H + \u2192 t * b and H + \u2192 W + h 0 \u2192 W + bb. The latter has a non-negligible contribution at intermediate values of tan \u03b2. Selection efficiencies are taken from simulation of top quark pair events for various masses of the top quark, the charged and neutral Higgs boson, h 0 . The simulation takes the dependence of the width of the top quark and the charged Higgs boson into account. The production cross-section is kept at its Standard Model value for m t = 175 GeV: \u03c3 tt = 6.7 \u00b1 0.9 pb. The event counts observed in data in the four channels are compared to the expectations in three different ways. For specific benchmarks of the MSSM a Bayesian approach is used to set limits on tan \u03b2. This analysis uses a flat prior on log tan \u03b2 within the theoretically allowed range. These limits are computed for various values of the charged Higgs boson mass and five different parameter benchmarks. Figure 41 (left) shows the results for one specific benchmark. For the high tan \u03b2 region H + \u2192\u03c4 \u03bd dominates in a large fraction of the MSSM parameter space. Setting the branching fraction of H + \u2192\u03c4 \u03bd to 100%, limits on the charged Higgs contribution to top quark decays are set using Bayesian statistics. A flat prior for B(t \u2192 H + b) between 0 and 1 is used. For charged Higgs boson masses between 80 GeV and 160 GeV CDF can exclude B(t \u2192 H + b) > 0.4 at 95% C.L.Finally, a more model independent limit is computed by scanning the full range of possible charged Higgs boson decays. For all five H \u00b1 decay modes considered the branching fraction is scanned in 21 steps, assuring that the sum of branching fractions adds to one. Limits on B(t \u2192 H + b) are computed for each combination. The least restrictive limit is quoted. Also this analysis is repeated for various charged Higgs boson masses. The limits obtained in this more general approach, shown inFig. 41 (right), exclude only very high contributions of charged Higgs bosons to top quark decays of above approximately 0.8 to 0.9, depending on the charged Higgs boson mass.",

Top: Expected and observed limits on a left-handed W \u2032 production cross-section times branching fraction of the decay to top and bottom quark as function of M W \u2032 compared to the theory prediction. Bottom: Same but for right-handed W \u2032 production[251].grounds. Also the W +heavy flavour fraction is derived from data. Multijet background is fully taken from data. Samples of W \u2032 boson events with masses up to 900 GeV are generated in conjunction with the single top quark samples taking interferences with the W boson into account that are present for the left-handed W \u2032 bosons. Because of this interference the Standard Model single top quark production in the s-channel is treated as part of the signal in the search for W \u2032 L bosons. The distribution of reconstructed \u221a\u015d measured by D\u00d8 agrees with the expectation from the Standard Model. Limits on a possible contribution from W \u2032 bosons decaying to top and bottom quarks are derived as a function of M W \u2032 assuming couplings like in the Standard Model, though possibly to right handed fermions. D\u00d8 uses the Bayesian approach with a flat non-negative prior on the crosssection times branching fraction. Expected and observed results are shown in Fig. 48. Comparing upper limits on the W \u2032 boson cross-section times branching fraction to top and bottom quark to the NLO theory predictions [252] excludes left-handed W \u2032 bosons with M W \u2032 L < 731 GeV. If only hadronic decays are allowed the right handed W \u2032 R boson is excluded for M W \u2032 R < 768 GeV, when leptonic decays are also possible the limit is 739 GeV.",
