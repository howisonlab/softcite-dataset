            "text": "Studies of nucleon resonance electrocouplings at various photon virtualities in double charged-pion electroproduction play an important role in the N * program with the CLAS detector [1,2]. Single and double pion photo and electroproduction are two major exclusive channels, contributing to the total photon-proton cross section in the N * excitation region. Both of these channels are sensitive to excited states. Photo and electroproduction of two pions are particularly sensitive to resonances with masses above 1.6 GeV. Many of these states decay preferentially to final states with two pions. Furthermore, 1\u03c0 and 2\u03c0 exclusive channels are strongly coupled by hadronic interactions in the final states (FSI). Hadronic cross section \u03c0N \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0N is the second strongest exclusive channel in value amongst exclusive \u03c0N cross sections. Therefore, a combined analysis of at least the two major electroproduction channels is needed to assure the appropriate evaluation of N * electrocouplings. Eventually other exclusive channels with smaller cross sections may be included. For these final states, the hadronic interactions with major meson photo or electroproduction channels become even more important. Therefore, comprehensive information on mechanisms contributing to both 1\u03c0 and 2\u03c0 electroproduction is of particular interest for the entire N * program. This information may be obtained in a phenomenological analysis of the CLAS data on meson electroproduction offering valuable input for N * studies in advanced coupled channel approaches, which are currently under development at the Excited Baryon Analysis Center (EBAC) at JLAB [3].",

Even in measurements without use of polarization observables, there are nine independent differential cross sections in each (W ,Q 2 ) bin. For the first time these data have become available from CLAS and some of them are shown in Fig. 3 and 4. The full data set obtained in the CLAS experiment [4,5] may be found in Ref. [6]. These data make it possible to establish all significant contributing mechanisms from the studies of their manifestations in observables, as peaks in invariant mass distributions or sharp slopes in angular distributions. Mechanisms without particular features may be determined, considering the correlations between shapes of their cross sections in various observables. We have developed a phenomenological model that incorporates particular meson-baryon mechanisms based on their manifestations in the observables. The analysis of earlier CLAS data [7] incorporated particular meson-baryon mechanisms needed to describe \u03c0 + p, \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , \u03c0 \u2212 p invariant masses and \u03c0 \u2212 angular distribution [8,9,10]. These cross sections were analyzed in the hadronic mass range from 1.41 to 1.89 GeV. The overall Q 2 -coverage ranges from 0.5 to 1.5 GeV 2 . In the 2005 version of this analysis approach (JM05) [11,12], double charged-pion production was described by the superposition of quasi-two-body channels with the formation and subsequent decay of unstable particles in the intermediate states:",

In addition to the differential cross sections mentioned above, they also included \u03c0 + and p angular distributions and three distributions over angles \u03b1 i,j between two planes, composed by the momenta of the initial proton and final hadron (first plane) and two the other final hadrons (a second plane) for three possible combinations amongst these pairs. We found that the JM05 model reasonably describes the data over all invariant masses and \u03c0 \u2212 angular distributions, as it is shown in Fig. 1. All these observables were previously studied in 2\u03c0 electroproduction at higher photon virtualities [12]. However, JM05 model version failed in reproducing \u03c0 + and p CM angular distributions included in the analysis for the first time. As it follows from Fig. 1, where the contributions from various mechanisms are presented, this failure is related to shortcomings in the description of direct 2\u03c0 production mechanisms in [13].",

Therefore, the successful description of all differential cross sections allowed us to pin down all major contributing processes and access their dynamics at the phenomenological level. To check the reliability of the amplitudes for contributing processes, derived in this phenomenological data analysis, we fixed all JM06 parameters, fitting them to six single-differential cross sections: all invariant masses, and three final state angular distributions. The remaining three distributions over the \u03b1 i,j angles were calculated, keeping JM06 parameters fixed. A reasonable description of \u03b1 i,j angular distributions was achieved in the entire kinematics covered by measurements.

Electrocouplings of all resonances were varied around their initial values, that were obtained by interpolating previous CLAS and world data. They were varied randomly according to a normal distribution with a \u03c3 of 30 %. Simultaneously, non-resonant mechanism parameters were varied with a \u03c3 of 10 %. For each trial set of JM06 parameters we calculated nine differential cross sections in all (W ,Q 2 ) bins, covered in the CLAS measurements [4,5]. Normalized to the amount of data points \u03c7 2 /d.p. were estimated from the comparison between measured and calculated differential cross sections. Finally, we selected calculated differential cross sections, which were closest to the experimental data applying the restriction for \u03c7 2 /d.p. listed in Table 1. The differential cross sections selected from the fit at W =1.43 GeV and Q 2 =0.425 GeV 2 are shown in Fig. 4 by various dashed lines. For each calculated differential cross section, selected in fitting procedure, we estimated the contribution from all isobar channels combined. The contribution from all isobar channels combined is shown in Fig. 4 by vertical bars. The information on the isobar channel contributions to all nine differential 2\u03c0 cross sections was obtained in our analysis for the first time. Fits within the framework of JM06 also enabled us to obtain amplitudes for the superposition of all quasi-twobody processes mentioned in the Section 2, as well as for any individual isobar channel. This information is of particular interest for future N * studies in a combined analysis of an 1\u03c0 and 2\u03c0 exclusive channels within the framework of an advanced coupled channel approach, which is currently under development by EBAC [3]. Moreover, the data on isobar channel differential cross sections and amplitudes open up new opportu- nities to establish explicit meson-baryon mechanisms contributing to various isobar channels. Predictions from various models, based on effective meson-baryon Lagrangians [3,16,17] may be compared with isobar channel cross sections and amplitudes determined from the CLAS 2\u03c0 data analysis. Fig. 5 shows the electrocouplings of the P 11 (1440) and D 13 (1520) states. For the first time, we obtain the Q 2 evolution of electrocouplings for these states from the \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + p channel at Q 2 from 0.2 to 0.6 GeV 2 .",
