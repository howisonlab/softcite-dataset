These systems show a long-range structure (large separation in \u2206\u03b7) at the near-(\u2206\u03d5 0) and away-side (\u2206\u03d5 \u03c0) of the trigger particle. In order to understand the nature of this effect the twoparticle correlation analysis has been extended to identified particles. Particles are identified up to transverse momentum pT values of 4 GeV/c using the energy loss signal in the Time Projection Chamber detector, complemented with the information from the Time of Flight detector. This measurement casts a new light on the potential collective (i.e. hydrodynamic) behaviour of particle production in p-Pb collisions.",

            "text": "The study of particle correlations is a powerful tool to probe the mechanism of particle production in collisions of hadrons and nuclei at high beam energy. This is achieved by measuring the distributions of relative angles \u2206\u03d5 and \u2206\u03b7, where \u2206\u03d5 and \u2206\u03b7 are the differences in azimuthal angle \u03d5 and pseudorapidity \u03b7 between two particles. In small systems, such as minimum-bias proton-proton (pp) collisions, the correlation at (\u2206\u03d5 \u2248 0, \u2206\u03b7 \u2248 0) is dominated by the \"nearside\" jet peak, and at \u2206\u03d5 \u2248 \u03c0 by the recoil or \"away-side\" structure due to particles originating from jet fragmentation [1]. Additional ridge-like structures, which persist over a long range in \u2206\u03b7, emerge in nucleus-nucleus (A-A) collisions in addition to the jet-related correlations [2][3][4] . Recent measurements in p-Pb collisions employed a procedure for removing the jet contribution by subtracting the correlations extracted from low-multiplicity events, revealing essentially the same long-range structures on the near and away side in high-multiplicity events [5,6]. These ridge structures have been attributed to mechanisms that involve initial-state effects, such as gluon saturation [7] and colour connections forming along the longitudinal direction [8], and finalstate effects, such as parton-induced interactions [9], and collective effects developing in a highdensity system possibly formed in these collisions [10]. To further characterize this effect in p-Pb collisions at \u221a s NN = 5.02 TeV, these ridge structures are studied via a Fourier decomposition [11] and the v 2 of pions, kaons and protons 1 has been measured.",
