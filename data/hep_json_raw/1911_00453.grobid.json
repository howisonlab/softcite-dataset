The intact final-state proton is reconstructed in the ATLAS ALFA forward spectrometer, while charged particles from the dissociated system X are measured in the central detector components. The fiducial range of the measurement is \u22124.0 < log 10 \u03be < \u22121.6 and 0.016 < |t| < 0.43 GeV 2 , where \u03be is the proton fractional energy loss and t is the squared four-momentum transfer. The total cross section integrated across the fiducial range is 1.59 \u00b1 0.13 mb. Cross sections are also measured differentially as functions of \u03be, t, and \u2206\u03b7, a variable that characterises the rapidity gap separating the proton and the system X. The data are consistent with an exponential t dependence, d\u03c3/dt \u221d e Bt with slope parameter B = 7.65 \u00b1 0.34 GeV \u22122 . Interpreted in the framework of triple Regge phenomenology, the \u03be dependence leads to a pomeron intercept of \u03b1(0) = 1.07 \u00b1 0.09.",

            "text": "In the single diffractive (SD) dissociation process in proton-proton (pp) collisions, pp \u2192 Xp (figure 1(a)), the absolute value of the squared four-momentum transfer t is usually much smaller than 1 GeV 2 , such that the intact final-state proton is scattered through a very small angle of typically 10-100 \u00b5rad. The other proton dissociates to produce a multiparticle hadronic system X, whose mass M X can reach many hundreds of GeV at Large Hadron Collider (LHC) energies, whilst remaining in a regime where the fractional energy loss of the intact proton \u03be = M 2 X /s is small. Measurements of the SD cross section have been made at a wide range of energies [1][2][3][4], most recently at the SPS [5,6], the Tevatron [7,8] and HERA [9]. The process is usually interpreted phenomenologically in terms of the exchange of a strongly interacting net colour-singlet, sometimes referred to as a pomeron [10]. The range of applicability of a universal pomeron across total, elastic, and diffractive processes has a long history of investigation. Despite the wealth of previous data, predictions for the SD contribution at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) vary widely. Our current lack of constraints limits JHEP02(2020)042 The kinematic variables used to describe the SD process (the squared four-momentum transfer, t, and the mass, M X , of the dissociated system X) are indicated in parentheses in (a).",

A special beam optics configuration [20] was in place for the data used here, incorporating 'parallel-to-point' focusing in the vertical plane, such that the y coordinate of the proton impact point in a Roman pot detector at fixed z depends only on the scattering angle and the energy loss. The optics configuration does not provide the parallel-to-point feature in the horizontal plane, so the x coordinate in the Roman pot detectors depends on the primary vertex position, which is measured by the central detector.

The SD, DD and CD models in Pythia8 are based on the exchange of a pomeron with trajectory \u03b1(t) = \u03b1(0) + \u03b1 t, assuming 'triple Regge' [22] formalism (see section 10). The models [23] are tuned using previous ATLAS data, including the total inelastic cross section [11] and rapidity gap spectra [14]. By default, the 'A3' tune [24] was used, which adopts the 'Donnachie-Landshoff' [25] choice for the pomeron flux factor to describe the \u03be and t dependences in the diffractive channels with pomeron intercept \u03b1(0) = 1.07. An alternative SD sample was produced using the A2 tune [26] and the Schuler-Sj\u00f6strand model for the pomeron flux factor [23], which has \u03b1(0) = 1 and therefore differs from Donnachie-Landshoff mainly in its \u03be dependence. Both tunes use the H1 2006 Fit B diffractive parton densities [27] as an input to model the hadronisation in the diffractive channels. For the non-diffractive channel, the A3 tune uses the NNPDF23LO [28] proton parton densities. Generated central particles were propagated through the Geant4 based simulation of ATLAS [29,30] to produce the simulated signals in the central detector components. The generated protons in diffractive processes are transported from the interaction point to the ALFA detectors by representing each element of the LHC optical lattice (quadrupole and dipole magnets) as a simple matrix under the thin-lens approximation, giving the total transfer matrix once multiplied together.",

Segments are reconstructed from hits in at least six u and six v fibre layers. To avoid areas of reduced performance close to the detector edges and efficiency losses in the shadow of beam collimators, track segments are restricted in the y coordinate to a region about 8 mm to 20 mm from the beam-line, varying slightly between stations. More than one track segment is reconstructed in an ALFA armlet in less than 1% of cases; the segment with the most overlapping fibres is then selected. Proton tracks are reconstructed from the combination of segments above or below the beam in adjacent near and far stations. Further constraints are derived from the expected correlation pattern between the average x-position of the track segments in the near and far stations (x) and the local angle the track makes in the (x, z) plane, \u03b8 x . The region with low values ofx and \u03b8 x is populated dominantly by SD processes at modest \u03be, whereas beam-related 'halo' background contributions cover a wide range inx and backgrounds from non-SD pp collisions are relatively evenly distributed in both variables. A bivariate Gaussian distribution is fitted to the observed two-dimensional (x, \u03b8 x ) distributions for each armlet, and tracks are accepted if they lie within a 3\u03c3 contour of the resulting ellipse.

For this sum, the minimum requirement on track transverse momentum is relaxed from 200 MeV to 100 MeV. Missing neutral and remaining low-p T charged particles are accounted for by applying a multiplicative linear function, determined from the MC simulations, to the reconstructed log 10 \u03be. The ability of the simulations to provide this correction within the precision defined by the associated systematics is supported by studies of charged particle distributions in diffraction at the LHC [40] and of diffractive charged particle spectra and total energy flows at previous colliders such as HERA [9]. Following this procedure, the resolution is approximately constant in log 10 \u03be at around 0.3. The variable \u03be can also be reconstructed using \u03be(ALFA) = 1 \u2212 E p /E p , where E p and E p are the scattered proton's energy as measured by ALFA and the beam energy, respectively. Although the ALFA reconstruction has increasingly poor resolution as \u03be becomes small, it provides a powerful means of cross-checking the ID-based measurement with very different background contributions, unfolding characteristics and other systematic effects.",

The overlay background is modelled using a data-driven technique in which the normalisation is determined from the probability per bunch crossing of reconstructing in ALFA a proton that passes the requirements applied in the main analysis and is not correlated with central detector activity. This probability is obtained from a control data sample in which there are hits in all 32 MBTS segments and reconstructed charged-particle tracks within 0.5 pseudorapidity units of both edges of the ID acceptance. This large amount of central detector activity implies heavy suppression of the phase space for correlated activity in ALFA. There is a reconstructed proton in ALFA in 0.77% of such events, which sets the overlay background normalisation, assuming that the ID and ALFA signals are always uncorrelated. A 9% correction is made for residual signal events in the sample, determined from MC simulations. For the t measurement, the shape of the overlay background contribution is taken directly from the distribution in the control sample. For \u03be and \u2206\u03b7, the shape is taken from the MC simulation of ND, DD and SD events that pass the central detector requirements but do not contain a proton in ALFA.",

In this case, the two armlets containing protons are in the backto-back azimuthal configuration approximately 96% of the time, indicating that elastic scattering is the dominant source of ALFA background signals. Figure 2(e) shows an example (\u2206\u03b7) control distribution in this sample. The data are well described, with the proton overlay contribution heavily dominant and the CD contribution being the next largest contribution. In 'Control Region 2', the CD contribution is enhanced by requiring activity in no fewer than two and no more than ten MBTS sectors. The normalisation of this sample is well described, as are the shapes of all relevant distributions except for that in \u03be(ID). The \u03be dependence in the CD MC simulation is therefore reweighted to better match the data in the control region whilst preserving the normalisation, yielding the description shown in figure 2(f). The CD contribution is the largest, although a substantial overlay background component remains. The CD contribution can be further enhanced by making even tighter requirements on small numbers of active MBTS sectors, at the expense of accepting fewer events.

The differential cross section in \u2206\u03b7, defined in terms of primary charged particles with p T > 200 MeV as described in section 5, is shown in figure 3. The error bars indicate the statistical and systematic uncertainties added in quadrature, although the statistical contributions are negligible for most data points. For gap sizes between about 1.5 and 3.5, the differential cross section exhibits the plateau that is characteristic of rapidity gap distributions in soft diffractive processes. There are deviations from this behaviour at smaller and larger gap sizes due to the definition of the observable in terms of a restricted rapidity region corresponding to the ID acceptance, and to the fiducial range restriction, respectively. The data are compared with the SD process simulations in the A2 and A3 tunes of Pythia8, which exceed the measurement by factors of 2.3 and 1.5, respectively. Both of these tunes are based on an integrated SD cross section, defined according to the Pythia8 model, of 12.5 mb. The difference between their predictions for the fiducial region of the measurement arises from the different pomeron intercepts \u03b1(0) in their flux factors (see section 3). Both models give a reasonable description of the shape of the \u2206\u03b7 distribution, the A2 tune being slightly better than A3. The excess of the Pythia8 prediction over data is compatible with previous ATLAS observations from rapidity gap spectra [14] assuming the DD contribution to the Pythia8 model of the previous measurement is correct. The Herwig7 prediction is also broadly in line with the shape of the \u2206\u03b7 distribution, but exhibits an even larger excess in normalisation. This may be partly due to the operational definition of the SD process that is adopted in the default SD model normalisation, which is derived from a rapidity gap measurement that also contains a DD admixture [33].  The cross section is shown differentially in |t| in figure 4. To avoid bias in the fit due to the fast-falling nature of the distribution, the data points are plotted at the average values of |t| in each bin, as calculated from the corrected data. The differential cross section is subjected to a fit of the form d\u03c3/dt \u221d e Bt , which is overlaid on the figure. The quality of the fit is acceptable (\u03c7 2 = 8.3 with eight degrees of freedom, considering statistical uncertainties only). The result is B = 7.65 \u00b1 0.26(stat.) \u00b1 0.22(syst.) GeV \u22122 , where the central value and statistical uncertainty are obtained by fitting with statistical uncertainties only, and the systematic uncertainty is obtained by repeating the fit separately for each systematic shift and adding the resulting deviations from the central value in quadrature. The measured slope parameter B corresponds to a value averaged over the fiducial \u03be range, with log 10 \u03be = \u22122.88 \u00b1 0.14, where the central value is taken from the Pythia8 A3 tune and the uncertainty is defined by the difference from the Pythia8 A2 tune. The largest contribution to the uncertainty in B arises from the proton overlay background subtraction, which has both a statistical and a systematic component. The result is stable with respect to variations of the fitted t range and is broadly as expected from extrapolations of lower-energy measurements. It is compatible with the predictions of 7.10 GeV \u22122 from the Donnachie-Landshoff flux and 7.82 GeV \u22122 from Schuler-Sj\u00f6strand, contained in the Pythia8 A3 and A2 tunes, at the 1.6\u03c3 and 0.5\u03c3 levels, respectively.",

(10.1) is applied to the measured \u03be distribution with \u03b1(0) and the overall normalisation as free parameters. The Donnachie-Landshoff value for the slope of the pomeron trajectory \u03b1 = 0.25 GeV \u22122 is taken for the central value, with \u03b1 = 0 used to determine the associated uncertainty. This fit, displayed in figure 5(a of \u03b1(0) = 1.07 \u00b1 0.02 (stat.) \u00b1 0.06 (syst.) \u00b1 0.06 (\u03b1 ). The largest systematic uncertainties apart from the \u03b1 assumption arise from the unfolding, the hadronisation uncertainty and the overlay background subtraction. This result is compatible with predictions using soft pomeron phenomenology and assuming a universality between total, elastic, and diffractive cross sections. It can be compared with the predictions of 1.14 and 1.00 from the Pythia8 A3 and A2 tunes, respectively, when applying the triple Regge formalism in place of the default Pythia8 model to which the A3 input value of 1.07 is applicable. It is not possible to compare the extracted \u03b1(0) and B parameters with predictions from Herwig7, since the \u03be dependence of the B slope has a complex behaviour in that model. There are no previously published LHC results in which the pure SD differential cross section is measured. However, the log 10 \u03be dependence has been measured by the CMS Collaboration at \u221a s = 7 TeV in an analysis using the rapidity gap technique [15] which includes the SD process with a small DD admixture, satisfying log 10 (M Y /GeV) < 0.5 where M Y is the mass of the unobserved, low mass, dissociating proton. The CMS rapidity gap and ATLAS tagged proton results are compared in figure 5(b), after extrapolating the ATLAS results to 0 < |t| < \u221e by applying a factor of 1.18, extracted using the measured slope parameter. The two analyses cover different but overlapping \u03be regions, with good agreement in the overlap region without subtracting any DD contribution from the CMS results or accounting for the difference between the centre-of-mass energies.",

Unlike in previous related analyses, the final-state protons are reconstructed directly, using the ALFA forward spectrometer. Differential cross sections are measured as a function of the fractional proton energy loss \u03be, the squared four-momentum transfer t, and the size \u2206\u03b7 of the pseudorapidity interval on the same side of the interaction point as the intact proton extending from \u03b7 = \u00b12.5 to the closest charged particle with smaller |\u03b7| and p T > 200 MeV. The fiducial range of the measurement is \u22124.0 < log 10 \u03be < \u22121.6 and 0.016 < |t| < 0.43 GeV 2 . For gap sizes between approximately 1.5 and 3.5, the cross section differential in \u2206\u03b7 exhibits the plateau that is characteristic of rapidity gap distributions in soft diffractive processes. There are deviations from the plateau at larger and smaller gap sizes due to the definition of the observable and the acceptance. The cross section differential in t is well described by an exponential behaviour, d\u03c3/dt \u221d e Bt with the slope parameter measured to be B = 7.65 \u00b1 0.34 GeV \u22122 , consistent with expectations and with extrapolations from lower-energy measurements. The variable \u03be is reconstructed using two complementary methods, based on either the scattered proton in ALFA or the tracks in the ID. The IDtrack-based measurement is adopted and the standard triple pomeron approach of Regge phenomenology is used to describe the data in terms of a pomeron trajectory with intercept \u03b1(0) = 1.07 \u00b1 0.09, in good agreement with previous values from ATLAS and elsewhere. The measured cross section integrated over the fiducial region amounts to 1.59 \u00b1 0.13 mb.
