It would provide a clue to how the matter in our universe might have evolved from the B = 0 early universe. If seen at rates observable in foreseeable next-generation experiments, it might well help us understand the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe.

By exploiting new slow neutron sources and optics technology developed for materials research, an optimized search for oscillations using free neutrons from a slow neutron moderator could improve existing limits on the free oscillation probability by at least three orders of magnitude. Such an experiment would deliver a slow neutron beam through a magnetically-shielded vacuum chamber to a thin annihilation target surrounded by a low-background antineutron annihilation detector. Antineutron annihilation in a target downstream of a free neutron beam is such a spectacular experimental signature that an essentially background-free search is possible. An authentic positive signal can be extinguished by a very small change in the ambient magnetic field in such an experiment. It is also possible to improve the sensitivity of neutron oscillation searches in nuclei using large underground detectors built mainly to search for proton decay and detect neutrinos. This paper summarizes the relevant theoretical developments, outlines some ideas to improve experimental searches for free neutron oscillations, and suggests avenues both for theoretical investigation and for future improvement in the experimental sensitivity.",

Neutrino and flavored neutral meson oscillations (K 0 , D 0 , B 0 , B s ) behave like natural interferometers which continue to teach us about aspects of physics (lepton-number violation, CP -violation, neutrino mass) that are not otherwise readily accessible experimentally. The high sensitivity of oscillations to rare processes arises from the interference between the relative phases for the relevant amplitudes. Since neutrons and antineutrons are electrically neutral, as is indicated by all available data [1,2], only the conservation of baryon number forbids a neutron (B = 1) from transforming into an antineutron (B = \u22121). The long \u03b2-decay lifetime of the free neutron makes a sensitive search for neutron-antineutron (n \u2212n) oscillations possible. In this paper we discuss the methods by which searches for n \u2212n oscillations can be conducted and the possibility for significant improvement in the experimental sensitivity to this process.",

            "text": "The decay of the lightest known charged particle, the electron, into other particles is forbidden by conservation of electric charge. Many channels are open for proton decay, so electric charge conservation does not account for proton stability. To understand the stability of the hydrogen atom, the existence of a conserved additive quantum number, called baryon number, for both protons and neutrons (with their antiparticles assigned opposite baryon number) was proposed long ago [3]. All laboratory experiments to date support exact baryon number conservation under the experimental conditions probed (which are at temperatures T << v EW , so SU(2) instanton/sphaleron violation of B is completely negligible). This conservation law does not follow from any known physical principle but is inferred from experiment. At the level of the Standard Model (SM) Lagrangian, baryon number conservation is \"accidental,\" in the sense that it depends on the specific gauge groups and matter content of the theory. Lepton number, L, is also accidentally conserved in the same sense in the SM Lagrangian. Note that baryon number and lepton number are exactly conserved only in perturbation theory; \"sphaleron\" effects involving non-perturbative electroweak gauge field configurations can lead to the creation or destruction of baryon and lepton number while preserving the difference B\u2212L. However, this non-perturbative process is so strongly suppressed in our present vacuum that there is absolutely no hope that it will induce a n \u2212n transition in the laboratory.",

In quantum field theory, Noether's theorem links conservation laws to continuous global symmetries. In the example we know best, conservation of electric charge is linked to a global U(1) em phase symmetry of the Lagrangian. Promoting U(1) em to a local (gauge) symmetry leads to quantum electrodynamics, in which the massless photon couples minimally to the conserved current mandated by the global symmetry. A global U(1) B symmetry could enforce B conservation, but we have no experimental evidence for the long-range interaction coupled to baryon number that would arise from a local U(1) B symmetry [4]. Besides, there are many examples where extensions of the SM, such as grand unified theories, lead to violation of baryon number. This expectation meshes with our present conception of early universe cosmology. Even if the universe began with no net baryon number, the 60 -70 rapid e-foldings of the expansion of the cosmological scale parameter, by which the inflationary paradigm accounts for the remarkable homogeneity of the cosmic microwave background, would tremendously dilute the number density of any particles which carry conserved quantum numbers.

The possibility of calculating this number directly from the laws of physics and cosmology and thereby explaining the ultimate origin of most of the (baryonic) matter around us is very exciting. It would be the cosmological equivalent of our understanding of the stellar fusion origin of most nuclei starting mainly from hydrogen and helium. This circumstance provides a new impetus both to the search for laboratory evidence of baryonnumber violation and to theories which can explain the dynamics which lead to the present size of the cosmological baryon asymmetry. This review summarizes the state of theoretical knowledge and experimental constraints on n \u2212n oscillations, and discusses recent developments in slow neutron technology that make it possible to improve the present limit on the free neutron oscillation probability by a few orders of magnitude. A null result at this level would place the most stringent limit on this possible mode of matter instability. As we shall discuss in \u00a72.3.2, the practical experimental figure of merit for a free neutron n \u2212n search is N n t 2 , where N n is the total number of free neutrons observed in the experiment and t is the observation time for free neutron propagation. The experiment would deliver a high flux of free neutrons from a slow neutron source through a long vacuum vessel with good magnetic shielding to a thin target to absorb the antineutron, surrounded by an antineutron annihilation detector. We argue that an improved experiment with a scientifically interesting reach requires a dedicated beamline optimized for the production of slow neutrons and their delivery to an antineutron annihilation target using modern neutron moderator and neutron optics technology.",

It can be increased by maximizing the phase space acceptance for neutron extraction around the cryogenic converter with advanced neutron optical supermirrors, whose performance (especially the neutron phase space acceptance) far exceeds that available to previous free neutron experiments. Optimizing the flux and brightness of the cold neutron source fed by the spallation target, the supermirror optics, the vacuum and magnetic shielding, and the annihilation detector for an oscillation experiment will need detailed R&D studies, but no new technology is required.

Searches for \u2206B = 2 processes using free neutron oscillations and neutron conversion in nuclei in underground detectors are complementary on many levels. Of course both processes require the presence of some effective operator which violates B by 2 units. For free neutron oscillations, however, there is the additional requirement that the neutron and antineutron energies are degenerate within the limit set by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle over the observation time of their flight from source to detector (this is the so-called \"quasi free\"condition). In the case of neutron conversion inside the nucleus, this degeneracy is removed by the large difference in neutron and antineutron optical potentials which partly arises from the strong-interaction antineutron annihilation occurring in matter. This means that any practical measurement under these conditions is insensitive to any sources of much smaller effects which can break this degeneracy. This makes the free neutron oscillation experiment sensitive to extremely small effects from exotic physics which can lift the neutron-antineutron energy degeneracy such as CP T /Lorentz violation [6]. A free neutron oscillation experiment is sensitive only to specific \u2206B = 2 operators at the nucleon level which lead to a free antineutron in the final state, whereas a search for neutron conversion in nuclei can access other \u2206B = 2 operators. For these reasons, a scientific program which aims to discover or constrain \u2206B = 2 processes should endeavor to search in both of these channels. We therefore also include a summary of the present limits on neutron-antineutron oscillations in nuclei from analysis of data from underground detectors and some discussion of future opportunities in this area in both theory and experiment.",

We argue that this combination of features is unique among all other known experimental approaches to B-violation using existing technology for the foreseeable future and therefore deserves to be brought to the attention of the broader scientific community. Second, there is a realistic possibility that a stringent lower bound on the n \u2212n oscillation rate, combined with Large Hadron Collider (LHC) results and constraints on rare processes from other experiments, could place significant constraints on that subset of baryogenesis scenarios which lie within the reach of experiment, such as electroweak baryogenesis and post-sphaleron baryogenesis. Third, the set of slow neutron technologies that enable this more sensitive search for free neutron oscillations is not widely known among particle physicists, as most of the development has occurred at neutron scattering user facilities that focus on materials research, so there is a need for a presentation which introduces a broader set of scientists to the physics behind these developments. The rest of this article is organized as follows: In \u00a72 we summarize the scientific motivation for the search for n \u2212n oscillations. A review of previous searches and prospects for improved searches in free neutron and intranuclear experiments are given in \u00a73 and \u00a74 respectively. The cold neutron source and optics needs for an improved free neutron search are detailed in \u00a75. We address the important design issues for a new detector in \u00a76. \u00a77 outlines research opportunities that can advance n \u2212n physics. \u00a78 is a compact summary.

Arguably the most powerful reason is that generating the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe requires that baryon number must be violated. The observed baryon asymmetry of the universe is often taken as indirect evidence for B-violating processes in nature, since it is strongly suspected on theoretical grounds that the baryon number in the very early universe was effectively zero. One might naively expect that one can simply insert any needed B asymmetry into the initial conditions of the universe by hand as an arbitrary initial condition. This possible explanation is in conflict with the apparent need for an infla-tionary period in the early history of the universe [7,8]. In this case inflation would drive the number density of any particles carrying a globally-conserved quantum number like B or L to zero at very early times. Subsequent Bviolating processes are then needed to generate the baryon asymmetry of the universe as it expands and cools. For this reason the present predominance of matter over antimatter in the universe is widely interpreted as indirect evidence for B-violation.",

Even though the rates for nonperturbative processes which lead to B-violation are exponentially suppressed in the present ground state of the universe, they should have been thermally excited in the early universe and can become important for baryogenesis at temperatures near the electroweak phase transition, which is expected to occur at T \u2248 170 GeV [16,18]. Unfortunately it seems that this known B-violation mechanism combined with the CP -violation known to exist in the SM, along with the degree of deviation from thermal equilibrium at the phase transition, yields a prediction for \u03b7 that is many orders of magnitude smaller than the observed value, when calculated within the standard Big Bang scenario. We therefore suspect that there must be some additional physics beyond the SM that greatly increases \u03b7, adding a new mechanism to one or more of the Sakharov conditions. Beyond the requirement that all three ingredients must be present and active at the same time since the Big Bang, however, this argument does not specify the mechanism responsible.",

            "text": "The existence of these sphaleron processes naturally divides models of baryogenesis into three qualitatively different regimes, according to whether or not the B generation comes from (a) a post-inflation L asymmetry from a higher scale that is converted by sphalerons into a B asymmetry (this general idea is referred to as leptogenesis [19]), (b) the phase transition dynamics at the electroweak scale itself in the absence of a pre-existing L asymmetry, coupled with new sources of CP -violation at or near this scale (this general idea is called electroweak baryogenesis), or (c) some new B-violating process at a scale below the electroweak phase transition (referred to as post-sphaleron baryogenesis). The leptogenesis scenario that violates L at high energy scales is favored at present by many theories, but it seems difficult to test using laboratory measurements. More attention has been devoted recently to scenarios wherein leptogenesis could occur at the TeV scale where it can be testable. The last two scenarios occur at energy scales low enough to be probed experimentally through searches for nonstandard B-violation and CP -violation. Electroweak baryogenesis, which provides an example of models of class (b), remains quite viable: see this recent review of electroweak baryogenesis models [17]. Some versions of electroweak baryogenesis are now under pressure from the recent discovery of the Higgs boson at the relatively low mass of 125 GeV. (Electroweak baryogenesis in the minimal supersymmetric SM (MSSM) requires that the scalar partner of the top quark must have a mass below 120 GeV for which there seems to be no evidence yet at the LHC). An example of class (c) models is the scenario of post-sphaleron baryogenesis, which is most likely to occur below the electroweak phase transition temperature. Such a low temperature essentially requires that baryogenesis must proceed via higher dimensional B-violating operators, the most likely example of which comes from the six-quark operator that leads to a \u2206B = 2 process; constraints on \u2206B = 1 processes from proton-decay searches are too stringent to generate nonzero B at such a low scale, and \u2206B = 3 processes would be in conflict with nucleosynthesis. Neutron-antineutron oscillations, which come from \u2206B = 2 operators, are therefore especially interesting as a probe for low-scale B-violation relevant to the baryon asymmetry.",

In the SM both B and L are globally conserved quantities in perturbation theory. Since the proton is the lightest baryon, these conservation laws explain why the proton does not decay. However it is obvious upon inspection that the SM cannot possibly represent the final word on particles and forces. In particular there is no reason why one would expect either B or L quantum numbers to be conserved on general grounds, even perturbatively. There is no direct experimental evidence for the corresponding gauge field that one introduces for all other charges in the SM in order to enforce the local conservation of charge demanded by relativity. This circumstance is sometimes expressed by saying that B and L are \"accidental\" symmetries of the SM. One therefore expects generically that neither B nor L is conserved perturbatively in the real underlying theory. A true understanding of the physics of baryon number violation requires comprehensive knowledge of the underlying symmetry principles, with distinct selection rules corresponding to different complementary scenarios for grand unification and for the generation of baryon asymmetry of the Universe.",

Even if the Majorana nature of the neutrino is established through observation of neutrinoless double beta decay, we would still need to understand at what scale this dynamics occurs. In general, a theory may violate L by two units without violating B; for example, the (zero-temperature) Standard Model, augmented by the addition of electroweak-singlet Majorana neutrino mass terms, violates L by two units, but conserves B.

In particular, an observation of n \u2192n could provide a hint that the small observed neutrino masses might not be a signal of physics at the GUT scale, as is widely assumed, but instead possible new physics at much lower scales.

            "text": "The unification of quarks and leptons in grand unified theories generically leads to the decay of the proton and the decay of neutrons bound in nuclei. In the simplest GUTs, these decays obey the selection rule \u2206B = \u22121 and \u2206L = \u22121, whence \u2206(B \u2212 L) = 0. Limits from experimental searches for decays of protons and otherwise stably bound neutrons helped to exclude nonsupersymmetric GUTs and are also in tension with some supersymmetric GUTs. The general possibility of a different kind of baryon-number violating process, namely the |\u2206B| = 2 process of n \u2212n oscillations, was suggested [33] even before the advent of GUTs. (One personal view of some of this history is given in [34]). This possibility was further discussed and studied after the development of GUTs in [24,35] and in subsequent models [36][37][38][39][40][41][42][43][44][45][46][47][48][49][50][51][52][53][54]. Recently, other models have been constructed that predict n \u2212n oscillations at levels within reach of an improved search, e.g. [44,45,48,53]. We proceed to discuss some of these models.",

This model was based on the idea that B \u2212 L is a local rather than a global symmetry. This idea is incorporated in the electroweak gauge group G LR and accommodates right-handed neutrinos and an associated seesaw mechanism. Once the model is embedded into a G 422 model that unifies quarks with leptons, it predicts the existence of n \u2212n oscillations with a transition time within the reach of experiments. The essential reason for this is the existence of TeV-scale color sextet bosons in this model, which can also be sought at the LHC.",

The basic idea is that since n \u2212n oscillations are a TeV-scale B-violating phenomenon, they will remain in equilibrium in the thermal plasma down to very low temperatures in the early universe. Hence, in combination with Standard-Model baryon-number-violating processes they will erase any pre-existing baryon asymmetry in the universe. Therefore in models with observable neutron oscillation, one must search for new ways to generate matter-antimatter asymmetry near or below the weak scale. Such a mechanism was proposed in a few recent papers [47,50,52], where it was shown that the high-dimensional operators that lead to processes such as neutron oscillation can indeed generate a baryon asymmetry via a mechanism called post-sphaleron baryogenesis. This mechanism specifically applies to the class of G 422 models for neutron oscillations discussed in Ref. [24], as well as to other models for neutron oscillations.

The cosmological requirements for baryogenesis then impose strong constraints on the parameters of the model and predict that there must be an upper limit on the free neutron oscillation time of 5 \u00d7 10 10 s [53], while for most of the parameter range it is below 10 10 s. Essentially what happens is that if the neutron oscillation time exceeds this bound, then the magnitude of the baryon asymmetry becomes smaller than its observed value or the color symmetry of the model breaks down, neither of which is acceptable for a realistic theory. It may therefore be concluded that if the search for n \u2212n oscillation up to a transition time of 10 10 s yields a null result, this scenario for baryogenesis will be ruled out.",

Although current experimental data are fully consistent with a four-dimensional Minkowski spacetime, it is useful to explore the possibility of extra dimensions, both from a purely phenomenological point of view and because the main candidate theory for quantum gravity, namely string theory, suggests the existence of higher dimensions. Ref. [45] focuses on theories where SM fields can propagate in extra dimensions and the wavefunctions of SM fermions have strong localization at various points in this extra-dimensional space. The effective size of the extra dimension(s) is denoted L; the associated mass parameter \u039b L = L \u22121 can be \u223c 50 \u2212 100 TeV. Such models are of interest partly because they can provide a mechanism for obtaining a hierarchy in fermion masses and quark mixing. In generic models of this type, excessively rapid proton decay can be avoided by arranging that the wavefunction centers of the u and d quarks are separated far from those of the e and \u00b5. However, as was pointed out in Ref. [45], this does not guarantee adequate suppression of n \u2212n oscillations, since this process does not involve any lepton fields. Indeed, for typical values of the parameters of the model, it was shown that n \u2212n oscillations occur at levels that are in accord with the current experiment limit but not too far below this limit. One of the interesting features of this model is that it is an example of a theory in which proton decay is negligible, while n \u2212n oscillations could be observable at levels close to current limits [45]. An effective-field-theory study of operators that can suppress proton decay but allow n \u2212n oscillations at observable levels was given in [54]. These operators make use of hypothetical scalar fields in addition to the Standard-Model Higgs boson.",

Neutron-antineutron oscillations due to non-conservation of baryons by virtual black hole evaporation (i.e. by the Zeldovich process [57]) have been studied in ref. [58]. It was argued in this work that the oscillation time would be 1 \u2212 2 orders of magnitude above the existing bounds if the fundamental gravity scale is a few TeV. We include some further remarks on models relevant to n \u2212n oscillations here. In addition to the non-accelerator experiments discussed in this paper, there are also attempts to find direct or indirect evidence for B and L-violation in the accelerator based experiments such as those based at the LHC. It is interesting to note that the simplest hint for possible B \u2212 L violating interactions may be the B \u2212 L conserving signal of the righthanded charged gauge boson (W R ). Searches for such a signal are being carried out at the LHC [59,60]. If evidence for a W R were to be established by the LHC, this would be consistent with the inference that at energies above the TeV scale, the applicable gauge group of Nature could be SU",

The physical meaning of this so-called \"quasi-free\" limit should be clear; it corresponds to the application of the energy-time uncertainty principle to the transition. The point is that, in the presence of an amplitude that causes oscillations between energy states, the free neutron is not an energy eigenstate of H. Also, for states like those of the neutron and antineutron which are degenerate in energy in the absence of an interaction that leads to oscillations, the admixture of the antineutron component of the state grows linearly for times short compared to the time needed for an observation to distinguish between the different neutron and antineutron energies in the ambient field, in accordance with the usual nonrelativistic dynamics of two state systems in quantum mechanics. It is perhaps a bit imprecise to use the term \"oscillations\" in this case, since in practice only a small fraction of an oscillation period can be accessed by any conceivable experiment, and one can argue that the search for n \u2212n in a slowly varying magnetic field tending to zero and reaching the regime |\u2206M | |\u03b4m| over some distance as a means to resonantly enhance the oscillations. This is already a regime that corresponds to the need to establish magnetic fields which are several orders of magnitude smaller than ever created in a laboratory, and therefore it is difficult to imagine how it could be done in practice. There are other methods for forcing the neutron and antineutron levels in a magnetic field to cross: for example one can apply a timedependent RF magnetic field to produce the well-known \"dressed\" neutron states known from quantum optics, which can cross for specially chosen amplitudes and frequencies of the RF field, or one could apply an electric field with a slow spatial gradient that changes sign and is effectively like a small v\u00d7 E magnetic field in the rest frame of the neutron. Even if any of these methods could reliably produce a level crossing, however, the well-known condition for reaching the adiabatic limit in this case, |d\u03b8/dt| 2 (\u2206M ) 2 + (\u03b4m) 2 , would, unfortunately, require the neutrons to spend an amount of time near this level crossing region of almost zero field which is many orders of magnitude larger than the neutron beta decay lifetime. [62] oscillations might be better characterized conceptually for many purposes as essentially a rare decay search. However, we will not use such terminology, since the oscillation language has been established in the extensive literature on the subject. In any case, it is clear that in this situation the experimental challenge is to observe a large enough number of neutrons for a long enough time under conditions in which the oscillation rate is not (yet) suppressed by these inevitably larger and difficult to control diagonal terms.",

An interesting feature of this limit is that it is the same order of magnitude as the present sensitivity of experiments conducted in large underground detectors. There is no fundamental physics reason why this should turn out to be the case, but it is true. We present an overview of the status and prospects of both free neutron experiments in \u00a73 and experiments using neutrons bound in nuclei in \u00a74, before concentrating on details concerning future free neutron searches in the following sections. Finally it is worth mentioning that there is another baryon system in which a search for oscillations have been considered: the \u039b \u2212\u039b system. The formalism presented above is also valid for this system. The presence of a valence strange quark in the \u039b means that a search in this system is in principle sensitive to different sources for \u2206B = 2 interactions. [68] The shorter lifetime of the \u039b and the lower intensities of \u039b beams imply that a dedicated fixed target experiment devoted to such a search is much less sensitive in terms of \u03b4m than a search using neutrons. A dedicated experiment to search for \u039b \u2212\u039b oscillations could be expected to reach a sensitivity to \u03b4m \u039b of about 10 \u221211 eV based on the capabilities of existing accelerator facilities.

According to the usual definition, this world is assumed to be almost identical to our world, but to differ in some respects, including a reversal in the sign of parity violation. Thus, instead of left-handed chiral components of fermions being doublets under an SU(2) weak isospin gauge group, the right-handed chiral components of the mirror fermions would be subject to a mirror SU(2) gauge group. The physics of the hypothetical mirror world could also be relevant at some level for n \u2212n oscillations. In particular, one could envision a different type of experiment, namely a regeneration experiment that could test for transitions of neutrons into mirror neutrons. In this experiment, a neutron beam would be incident on a thick absorber. If some fraction of the neutrons were to undergo transitions to mirror neutrons, then they would pass through the absorber, since particles in the hypothetical mirror world do not have direct interactions with particles in our world. The mirror neutrons would then emerge from the absorber and could undergo further oscillations back to regular neutrons, which could be detected.

The basic idea for these experiments (greater detail is given in \u00a75 and \u00a76) is to prepare a beam of slow neutrons (kinetic energies of a few meV and below: Appendix B discusses the physics of slow neutron moderation) which propagate freely from the exit of a neutron optical guide to a distant antineutron annihilation target. (Neutrons in this low energy range possess an index of refraction in matter which is less than one. This corresponds to total external reflection from material surfaces and makes neutron optical guides possible: see Appendix C). During the time in which the neutron propagates freely, a B-violating interaction can produce oscillations from an initial neutron state to one with an admixture of neutron and antineutron amplitudes. Antineutron appearance can be sought experimentally through annihilation in a thin material target, which generates a star pattern of final state momenta with 4 \u2212 5 pions on average. This signature can be seen with a tracking detector and calorimeter enclosing the target region. This rather unique signature strongly suppresses potential backgrounds. As noted above to observe this signal, the \"quasi-free\" condition \u2206E \u2022 t 1 must hold. This creates an experimental requirement for low gas pressures in the vacuum chamber (below roughly 10 \u22125 Pa) and very small ambient magnetic fields (between 1 and 10 nT) for any proposed new experiment using free neutrons in order to prevent the energy splitting between the neutron and antineutron in matter and external fields from damping the oscillations.",

The ILL experiment used a cold neutron beam from their 58 MW research reactor with a neutron current of 1.25\u00d710 11 n/s incident on the annihilation target and achieved a limit of \u03c4 n\u2212n > 0.86 \u00d7 10 8 s [63]. The average velocity of the cold neutrons was \u223c 600 m/s and the average neutron observation time was \u223c 0.1 s. A vacuum of P 2 \u00d7 10 \u22124 Pa maintained in the neutron flight volume and a magnetic field of | B| < 10 nT satisfied the quasi-free conditions for oscillations to occur [87][88][89]. Antineutron appearance was sought through annihilation with a \u223c 130 \u00b5m thick carbon film target which generated at least two tracks (one due to a charged particle) in the tracking detector with a total energy above 850 MeV in the surrounding calorimeter. In one year of operation the ILL experiment saw zero candidate events with zero background [63] using a tracking detector with crude (several cm) spatial resolution for the annihilation vertex compared with present technology. We feel that this impressively clean experiment offers strong encouragement to believe that the sensitivity of an upgraded experiment along the same lines could be improved given the great progress made in slow neutron optics since this experiment was performed.

Appendix A briefly discusses some aspects of intense neutron sources based on fission and spallation. Unlike the 1 GW power reactors sometimes used for neutrino oscillation studies, the relevant parameter for intense slow neutron sources is not total flux (and therefore total power) but rather neutron brightness (and therefore power density). The power density near the core of research reactors like the Institut Laue-Langevin (ILL) is already close to the present engineering limits beyond which the reactor core is in danger of melting. The most ambitious design project known to us for a next-generation reactor-based slow neutron facility, the Advanced Neutron Source considered at ORNL in the early 1990's, was able with difficulty to achieve an increase of about a factor of 5 in the neutron brightness near the core at the cost of a rather complex design. In the end this project was not pursued, and no similar sources are under consideration at present.",

The 1 MW Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) and the 1 MW Japanese Spallation Neutron Source (JSNS) are about one order of magnitude more efficient in the number of neutrons produced per unit dissipation of power in the target but still possesses a time-averaged neutron brightness which is about a order of magnitude below that from the ILL. Only the 5 MW European Spallation Source (ESS) planned for early 2020 foresees a time-averaged neutron brightness equal to the ILL. Therefore, the opportunities for improving the measurement precision rely mainly on advances in the efficiency and effectiveness of neutron moderation near the primary source, on the increased phase space acceptance of the devices which deliver the neutrons from the moderator to the annihilation target, and on the arrangement of the experimental geometry to maximize the observation of the free flight time of the neutron while maintaining the quasi-free condition. Furthermore, present neutron technology does not yet possess the capability to increase the phase space density of the slow neutrons during their delivery from the moderator to the annihilation target, which means that we must assume that the motion of the neutrons after leaving the moderator conserves phase space density according to Liouville's theorem. This constraint fundamentally limits how the phase space of the beam can be manipulated. We therefore keep these constraints in mind in presenting the opportunities for improvement which we describe below. The single most important improvement in the sensitivity of a n \u2212n search can be achieved by focusing neutrons with neutron reflecting surfaces, e.g. of elliptical shape. If a point-like neutron source is placed in the focus of an ellipsoid, neutrons specularly reflected from the inner surface of the ellipsoid will arrive at the second focus of the ellipse. Supermirror surface reflecting technology is discussed in \u00a75.4 of this paper. Using a truncated large elliptical focusing reflector [91] around the beam axis makes it possible to intercept neutrons emitted from a larger solid angle of the source and direct them by single reflection to the desired position along the beam. Despite the finite dimensions of the source and the limited phase space acceptance of the supermirrors, which reflect only neutrons with incident transverse velocities 40 m/s, very effective focusing can still be achieved in the focal plane where the image intensity can be 2-3 orders of magnitude higher than without a focusing device based on the simulations presented in section 6. Only the slow part of the neutron spectrum can be efficiently transported in this way, but this part is most valuable for optimizing the N t 2 figure of merit for n\u2212n.",

The use of a focusing reflector allows enhancement of the sensitivity roughly proportional to L 2 . Earth's gravity can significantly reduce the sensitivity of focused cold neutron beams because the most valuable slowest neutrons will fall and miss the annihilation target. Optimization of the sensitivity for a given energy spectrum of source neutrons can be achieved by adjustment of the length L as well as parameters of reflector, source, and annihilation target.",

The initial intensity of the neutron source was determined in the ILL experiment by the brightness of the liquid deuterium cold neutron source and the transmission of the curved neutron guide. Although in principle one expects the sensitivity to improve as the average velocity of neutrons is reduced, it is not practical in a horizontal geometry to use very cold (< 200 m/s) and ultracold neutrons (UCN, defined roughly as neutrons with speeds of < 7 m/s). Earth's gravity will not allow free transport of very slow neutrons over significant distances in the horizontal direction without having then eventually bounce from the vacuum chamber wall and therefore bring to an end the free oscillation time by subjecting them to the large n \u2212n optical potential difference in matter. These very slow neutrons will not reach the annihilation target and will be lost in the search for n \u2212n. As a result, the ultimate sensitivity of a free neutron oscillation experiment on Earth can only be reached with a vertical orientation for the flight path from source to detector. We estimate that this approach could achieve an additional factor of \u223c 100 in experimental sensitivity, corresponding to limits for the oscillation time parameter of \u03c4 n\u2212n > 10 10 s. However we do not present a specific design for that option in this paper, in part because of the increased expense required for the magnetic shielding and vacuum, in part due to the expenses associated with excavating a vertical hole deep enough to take advantage of this operational mode (we have not yet been able to identify an existing vertical hole which would fulfill the needed requirements), and in part due to the possible complications involved in putting an intense neutron source directly over a large hole.",

            "text": "It is clear that any new search for oscillations in a free neutron beam will require a very intense source of cold neutrons. Such neutron beams are available at facilities optimized for condensed matter studies focused on neutron scattering. These sources may be based on high flux reactors such as the ILL, the High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR), and the Dubna IBR-2 pulsed reactor, or on accelerator based spallation sources such as SNS, JSNS, or SINQ. However, all such existing neutron sources are already designed and optimized to serve a large number of neutron scattering instruments that each require relatively small neutron beams compared to what would be interesting for a neutron oscillation experiment. There are no beams to our knowledge suitable for this experiment constructed at existing sources as the beam size is limited to provide the energy or momentum resolution necessary for virtually all neutron scattering spectroscopy instruments suitable for materials research. A fully optimized neutron source for an n \u2212n oscillation experiment would require a beam having a larger cross section and larger solid angle in comparison with those available at neutron scattering facilities. The creation of such a beam at an existing facility would typically require very major modifications to the source/moderator/shielding configuration  that would seriously impact its efficacy for neutron scattering. This access issue is one important reason there has been no improvement in the limit on free neutron n \u2212n oscillations since the ILL experiment of 1994. Below we argue that a beam at a MW-scale spallation source designed specifically for delivering intense cold neutrons for nuclear and particle physics experiments is an essential element of any slow neutron experiment capable of extending the current limit on \u03c4 n\u2212n by many orders of magnitude.",

The practical difficulties of realizing these somewhat more stringent goals does not seem to be an issue of principle which makes the experiment impossible.

In large underground detectors the very large suppression in mixing from the difference of the neutron and antineutron optical potential in the nuclear medium is compensated by the large number of nucleons available for observation in a nucleon decay detector such as Soudan-2 [92] or Super-Kamiokande [93], the latter of which contained \u223c 10 33 neutrons in the fiducial volume of the detector. Limits on matter instability due to n \u2212n oscillations have therefore been reported by several nucleon decay experiments [22]. The striking signature from an antineutron annihilation event, consisting of \u223c 2 GeV of energy shared by \u223c 5 pions with zero net momentum, can be clearly visible in even a large volume detector. However these reaction products are emitted from a point within the nucleus ( 16 O in a water Cherenkov detector and mainly 56 Fe in the Soudan-2 detector) and interact as they propagate through the nucleus. This is a complicated process to model and it introduces some extra uncertainty in the interpretation of the results.",

In the presence of irreducible backgrounds it is possible to set higher limits for the nuclear lifetime, but it is impossible to discover a new effect unambiguously with a modest improvement of detector mass or exposure time. Table 1 also gives limits obtained recently by the SNO [94] (preliminary result based on a fraction of total statistics) and Super-K [93] collaborations. The limit from the SNO detector is close to the limit obtained by the much larger Super-K experiment partially due to smaller nuclear suppression factor for deuterium. A more recent evaluation of this factor from a field-theoretical approach is given in recent publications [99], where the role of the possible spin structure of the p \u2212n annihilation amplitude has been studied as well. The SNO result can be improved using the complete SNO data set, which is a factor of 4 times larger than the sample used in the existing analysis. A careful analysis of the SNO data is especially important in this context as the deuteron is a simple enough system to imagine the possibility of a much more reliable theoretical calculation of R.",

The expansion of the size and granularity of these large water Cherenkov-based underground detectors, combined with the presence of significant atmospheric neutrino backgrounds which already affects the extraction of the present limits, seems to indicate that it will be difficult in the future to use these detectors to significantly improve the present limits without the development of a new detector technology which can be deployed in large volumes.

The most recent calculation for the 16 O nucleus of R = 0.5 \u00d7 10 23 s \u22121 [66], yields an oscillation time lower limit of 2.7 \u00d7 10 8 s. Existing theoretical calculations of the relationship between the rate of n \u2212n oscillation in nuclei and the free n \u2212n transition rate seem to capture the dominant physics [66], but various processes not previously considered are known to exist. Since the isospin change for n \u2212n in nuclei can be \u2206I = 1, 2, or 3 [103] (for free neutrons only \u2206I = 1 is possible) one can also get contributions to the nuclear conversion process from n \u2212n oscillations in the nucleus and from dinucleon conversion into pions or kaons, which would give a very similar signal in the underground detectors. A qualitative discussion of the importance of such processes relative to n \u2212n in nuclei was presented in [65] and references therein.",

The question of how much these limits might improve, along with the whole subject of the experimental prospects for improvement on the limits for proton decay, is beyond the scope of this work. However we mention some examples of projects under discussion or development which might be able to produce such improvements in the future. One example is a larger underground detector based on the well-established water-Cherenkov detector technology, such as Hyper-K [100] and another is the large liquid argon detector proposed for the long baseline neutrino experiment (LBNF/DUNE) [101]. For these detectors, one can make a reasonable set of extrapolations for the potential reach for n \u2212n oscillations using the fact that the present versions of such detectors possess an irreducible background from atmospheric neutrinos that will be scaled up with detector mass and exposure time. In this case it will be possible to set a lower limit for n \u2212n, but will not be possible to claim a discovery of a new effect. For example, the new result of Super-K experiment on n \u2212n with the limit [93] of \u03c4 m > 1.9 \u00d7 10 32 yr is based on the 24 selected candidate events with a background of 24.1 events. Here it cannot be excluded that a few events are due to the genuine n \u2212n events. In the absence of background, one detected candidate in this data sample would correspond to the observation of a new n \u2212n effect with a lifetime of \u223c 2.5 \u00d7 10 34 yr. Without improvements in water-Cherenkov technology the n \u2212n lifetime limit obtained by proposed 500-kt Hyper-K [100] detector for 10 years of exposure in our estimate would increase only to \u223c 7.5 \u00d7 10 32 yr.",

In small volume prototypes these detectors have demonstrated impressive spatial resolution and particle ID capability [104][105][106][107]. The key question from the point of view of this work is whether these capabilities can be scaled up to very large detector volumes with the ability to eliminate the atmospheric neutrino background completely. In the complete absence of atmospheric neutrino background, one candidate event in the 40-kt DUNE detector after 10 years of exposure time can correspond to a n\u2212n discovery with a lifetime of \u223c 10 35 yr. If the complete elimination of background will not be possible, its significant suppression (comparing to the level of water-Cherenkov detectors) would enable the exploration of n \u2212n lifetimes in the range 10 33 \u2212 10 35 yr. These questions of potentially possible atmospheric neutrino background reduction in liquid argon detectors are under study [108]. The LBNF/DUNE detector will also allow exploration of other modes of nuclear instability related to n \u2212n and to \u2206B = 2 and B \u2212 L violation, such as N N \u2192 K s, N N \u2192 \u03c0 s, and others. Modes of neutron decay with the poorest experimental limits, such as n \u2192 3\u03bd, n \u2192 5\u03bd and nn \u2192 2\u03bd, are favored in some models [109]. If such processes were to occur in nuclei they would leave neutron holes whose de-excitation would leave characteristic signatures [110]. Data from underground detectors built to observe neutrino oscillations can also place stronger constraints on such possible n and nn decay modes [111][112][113].",

One needs a source that can provide maximum brightness from a large-area cold neutron moderator. Although the coldest neutrons with velocities v \u2264 200 m/s cannot be efficiently used in the horizontal version of a n \u2212n search experiment, these neutrons still constitute a small fraction of Maxwell-Boltzmann velocity distribution for cold neutron spectra that can be generated by practical cold moderators (i.e. cryogenic para-hydrogen, or deuterium). Finding new mechanisms and materials for efficient neutron moderation to the lower spectrum of temperatures might enhance the sensitivity of a n \u2212n search. A very important factor for an advanced highsensitivity n \u2212n search is the ability to access a large solid angle of neutron emission from the moderator surface. Most neutron scattering instruments use a typical acceptance angle of 1-3 degrees. In order to take advantage of the focusing reflector option for a n \u2212n search, the acceptance angle in the horizontal layout of experiment must be increased to 10-20 degrees. At the same time, the input aperture of the neutron transport system should allow one to view the whole area of the moderator. The actual acceptance angle in the design of an experiment should be found from parameter optimization with overall construction cost included as one of the main parameters. In this section we also describe the concepts of the neutron transport system including the vacuum vessel, supermirror reflective optics, and active/passive magnetic shielding that allow for creation of the \"quasi-free\" conditions for neutrons flying between moderator and annihilation detector. The latter will be discussed in \u00a76.",

The SNS uses a liquid mercury target running at 1 MW with a proton energy of 825 MeV and a frequency of 60 Hz. The time-averaged flux of neutrons with kinetic energies below 5 meV at a distance of 2 m from the surface of the coupled moderators is 1.4\u00d710 9 n/cm 2 /s at 1 MW [119]. The SINQ source is currently the strongest operating continuous mode spallation neutron source in the world. It receives an effectively continuous (51 MHz microstructure) 590 MeV proton beam at a current up to 2.3 mA. Under normal operation the beam current is typically 1.5 mA. The SINQ source uses a cannelloni target made of an array of Zircaloy clad lead cylinders. The cold neutron beam contains a flux of 2.8\u00d710 9 n/cm 2 /s at 1 MW at a distance of 1.5 m from the surface of the Target 8 coupled moderators [120]. The best potential for a n \u2212n search among facilities now under construction will be provided by the European Spallation Source (ESS) that will be commissioned in Sweden near Lund in 2019 [121]. The proton beam will be accelerated by a linac to an energy of 2 GeV and will be deposited on a rotating solid tungsten target with pulses widtha of 2.86 ms at a repetition rate of 14 Hz. The timeaverage beam power on target will be 5 MW. The tungsten target will be arranged as a disk rotating in the horizontal plane with segments cooled by helium gas. High-density tungsten will provide a very compact source of spallation neutrons. A cold para-hydrogen moderator installed above the target disk and surrounded by a Be reflector will act as a cold source with brightness up to 7.4 \u00d7 10 13 n/s/cm 3 /sr. The target design will allow for a beam port with large angle acceptance. An option exists for a second moderator below the target [122].

Generally speaking spallation of GeV protons beans on high atomic number elements produce the highest brightness sources: at higher proton energies a growing fraction of the energy goes into pion production. Possible liquid spallation neutron targets include Hg and Pb-Bi eutectic. Possible solid spallation targets include lead and tungsten alloys with a tantalum coating and either light or heavy water cooling. The biggest engineering problems associated with the spallation target bombarded by a 1-MW continuous proton beam are heat removal and radiation damage. The proton beam spatial profile determines the largest energy density that can be cooled. Radiation damage in 316L alloy stainless steel has been researched extensively and is often employed as a key target component. With some solid targets \"after-heat \", namely, the heat generated in the target by radioactive substances even after the proton beam is off, must be considered in the design. Liquid targets such as mercury or lead bismuth flowing inside a 316L boundary are used at the SNS and JSNS [118]. Solid target materials with internal water cooling channels have also been used in high intensity spallation target applications. The target material is subject to high mass specific thermal loading, and both peak temperature and temperature gradients in the solid material can encounter structural design constraints. Peak thermal fluxes at the solid to coolant interface in a high performance cooling circuit can approach 10 6 W/m 2 . The high thermal flux and typical small cooling channel cross sections naturally leads to rapid bulk temperature rise in the coolant and the need to limit coolant residence times. These constraints in turn lead to high coolant flow velocities and rapid fluid pressure losses. Aggressive cooling designs are required to reduce the volume of low density coolant in the target volume, which degrades the neutronic performance. Solid rotating targets under study for the SNS second target station and for the ESS long-pulse spallation target can also be considered.",

The SNS also incorporated a highly-dexterous, bridgemounted servo-manipulator system as well as a separate bridge-mounted crane to provide remote maintenance capability throughout the entire cell; remote operations are augmented with a closed-circuit viewing system using in-cell cameras tolerant of high radiation doses.

We discuss neutron moderation theory in Appendix B. It is perhaps not surprising that the phase space compression (cooling) of neutral particles such as neutrons is especially challenging, but it is worth outlining the specific issues encountered in the slow neutron regime. Since the neutrons of interest lie in an energy range (meV) in which the neutron does not possess internal degrees of freedom accessible by the application of external fields (neutron spin flips in external magnetic fields are only in the \u00b5eV range), the only efficient way at present to increase neutron phase space density is through collisions in a cold material medium. In this case we must resolve a contradiction: when we cool the medium to very low temperatures, the degrees of freedom which can interact inelastically with slow neutrons whose wavelengths are larger than interatomic spacings of the material tend to freeze. It is known that the cross sections for neutron cooling through the universally-available mechanism of phonon creation suffer from a reduced accessible phase space for lower energy neutrons proportional to \u03c9 3 where \u03c9 is the phonon frequency. Furthermore the inelastic elementary excitations in condensed matter systems generally possess energy-momentum dispersion relations which intersect that for a free neutron at only a few specific energy and momenta, thereby further reducing the fraction of inelastic events in the medium. We also must take into account the increased importance of neutron absorption in nuclei for the slower neutrons, especially since the slowest neutrons are the most important ones for this experiment. Therefore one cannot simply stick slow neutrons in an arbitrary cold solid medium and expect the neutrons to efficiently cool to the temperature of the medium.",

For a fixed transverse momentum acceptance of the neutron optical components downstream of the moderator, a slower spectrum allows neutron guides to accept and transport neutrons from a larger solid angle in the source and thereby increase the intensity in the experiment. The intense radiation field experienced by the moderator near a MW spallation target poses both a cryogenic engineering challenge and also a safety challenge which further restrict somewhat the choice of moderator materials. Both liquid hydrogen and liquid deuterium are known to be able to tolerate this environment. The neutron moderating properties are also strongly influenced by the spin states of the molecules as the spin flips cause transitions between rotational molecular levels with energy separations on the meV scale. The fact that there is still some room for optimization of the cold neutron brightness from liquid hydrogen moderators can be seen in a comparison between the brightness of the SNS liquid hydrogen moderators and those of the JSNS, which are brighter by about a factor of 2 because of their choice of liquid parahydrogen as the moderator medium combined with a beryllium reflector. Both materials possess a total neutron scattering cross section which falls rapidly for neutrons with energies below some critical energy, which allows the moderator to keep the neutrons in a relatively small spatial volume as they are slowing down from higher energies and release them as they fall below this critical energy. Recent investigations for the proposed moderators at the ESS have also exploited the special properties of liquid parahydrogen to demonstrate the possibility for increased neutron brightness.",

One can crudely estimate V opt as follows: if one assumes that the 10 MeV potential energy of a neutron in the nucleus of radius 1 fm is averaged over the volume of a material made of atoms whose size is larger than the nucleus by a factor of 10 5 , then the average potential energy V opt \u223c 100 neV. For a non-relativistic neutron of kinetic energy of a few meV one can therefore get total external reflection for angles of incidence of a few mrad. Since this ILL experiment multilayer coatings of alternating materials with large neutron optical potential differences with a graded distribution of separations called \"supermirrors\" [123] have been developed which greatly increase the range of transverse momenta which can be reflected with high probability and therefore the transverse phase space acceptance from the source by exploiting coherent interference of scattering from the different layers (diffraction) over the full spectrum of neutron wavelengths from the cold source. Supermirror performance is roughly classified by a parameter m defined by p T = mp T,N i which measures the increase of the critical angle of reflection relative to nickel of natural isotopic abundance where specular reflection still occurs. Commercially available supermirror materials constructed out of alternating layers of nickel and titanium now have m-values of up to seven, and since the transverse phase space acceptance of the guide system from the moderator scales as m 2 this represents a major increase in the number of neutrons that can be delivered to an antineutron annihilation target. In addition to this major extension in the range of transverse momenta of neutrons that can be reflected, supermirror neutron optics have also been successfully deployed on curved surfaces. This capability can also increases the transverse phase space acceptance of a neutron optical guide system. This becomes clear if one considers the extreme case of a point neutron source and a point antineutron annihilation target: in this case the optimum mirror arrangement consists of an elliptical mirror reflector with the source at one focus and the target at the other focus, which obviously delivers more neutrons than a guide system of rectangular cross section with the same m. Curved neutron guides can now be made commercially and are starting to find applications in neutron scattering facilities. Tests using a parabolically-shaped neutron guide coated with m=3 supermirrors showed excellent agreement between simulations and measurement. The neutron guide implemented for the WISH diffractometer [124] at the ISIS second target station employs a horizontal 40 m elliptical neutron guide made of m=2 supermirrors enclosed in a large vacuum tank in a configuration not unlike that which could be adopted in a n \u2212n oscillation experiment.",

The proximity of the mirror reflectors to the neutron source and the maximum diameter of the reflection chamber should be chosen so that the phase space acceptance of the guides is fully illuminated.

Helium gas cooled neutron supermirrors with m = 3.5 deposited on polished flat aluminum substrates located are now known to withstand the SNS radiation environment about 1m from the cold neutron source over a few years of operation with no measurable degradation in performance.

For the magnetic shielding geometries of both the previous ILL experiment and the proposed experiment, which use long shields with cylindrical symmetry, the dominant component of the residual magnetic field inside the shield is the component along the axis of the shield. The internal shield for the previous ILL experiment strongly suppressed transverse components of the magnetic field and rendered the longitudinal component sufficiently uniform that it could be largely compensated by a homogeneous external field generated by a coil wrapped on the outside of the shield [87,88]. Once this major component to the residual field was removed, another set of coils were able to trim out the residual transverse fields. Current loops for shield demagnetization, an active compensation system for external magnetic field variations (including transverse fields), internal magnetometry, and removal of large external sources of magnetic field gradients were also required to ensure maintenance of the quasi-free condition. Since this experiment was performed a great deal has been learned about large volume magnetic shield technology in the course of R&D performed for experiments which search for the neutron electric dipole moment [125]. We therefore do not foresee any issues of principle which would forbid us to reach this goal, but a significant research program to understand how to achieve this lower limit in a cost-effective manner, and to understand the possible reduction in sensitivity that might arise from residual field configurations would clearly be needed.",

This was done by inserting a neutron polarizer and a neutron polarization analyzer before and after the magnetic field-free region. If the neutrons are polarized transverse to this axis, then the presence of a magnetic field along the axis of the shield will rotate the neutron polarization direction by an angle \u03c6 = \u03b3BT where \u03b3 is the neutron gyromagnetic ratio, B is the magnetic field, and T is the time that the neutron spends in the field. For cold neutrons of 1 second flight time and B = 1 nT this angle is about 0.2 radians. The neutron cold source produces a broad spectrum of neutron velocities and this will lead to a distribution of rotation angles. One can chop the beam mechanically if necessary, but a more elegant solution (used in the ILL experiment) is to employ a second magnetic coil before the polarization analyzer with a known internal field and length and operate the measurement in \"spin echo \"mode. In this case when the echo condition is met the final neutron polarization is high and insensitive to the velocity distribution in the beam, and the decrease of the polarization away from this resonance condition depends on the shape of the velocity distribution. Furthermore by changing the direction of the second magnetic coil in all 3 directions and using the spin echo detection method one can measure the line integral of all three magnetic field components in the shield as seen by the neutrons. It is therefore quite feasible if necessary to use a polarized free neutron beam as a magnetometer to confirm the maintenance of the quasi-free condition.",

Fortunately there is extensive experience in the experimental physics community with a much larger vacuum chamber than needed for this experiment with a much more stringent vacuum requirement: namely, the 2 km long, 1.2 m diameter vacuum chambers for the LIGO gravitational wave observatory. The LIGO vacuum tubes are operated at the (much lower) pressure of order 10 \u22127 Pa, achieved after 2 months of pumping with 9 pumps, each connected to a 25 cm diameter pumpout port. Once this ultimate pressure is reached they can be maintained at this pressure with only pumping at the ends of the chamber. In LIGO this relatively simple vacuum solution was achieved through the use of nonmagnetic 304L stainless steel which was baked at 150C by electrical heating of the tube (using the tube as a resistor). In addition the steel was heat-treated during manufacture to reduce the hydrogen outgassing rate from the usual 10 \u221211 torr liters/s/cm 2 to 5\u00d710 \u221214 torr liters/s/cm 2 . The required purity of the internal surface of the stainless steel was maintained during on-site welding assembly through the development of a continuous spiral welding process [131]. For a vacuum chamber of diameter larger than LIGO that one would expect to use in a slow n \u2212n oscillation experiment the gas dynamics in this pressure regime is faster. Because of the larger diameter of the tube and the less stringent vacuum demands for the n \u2212n experiment even the outgassing rate from untreated stainless could be handled with a few hundred liters/s pumping speed. We therefore again see no issue of principle which would preclude a new experiment from meeting this condition.",

We do not include in our estimate the various methods by which the initial cold neutron brightness might be increased which are the subjects for ongoing research. Examples include neutronics techniques such as a reentrant moderator designs [133], strategic use of neutron reflector/filters [134], supermirror reflectors [123], and non-specular, high-albedo materials such as diamond nanoparticle composites [135][136][137]. Some of these techniques are not suitable for use at multipurpose spallation sources serving a materials science user community, where sharply defined neutron pulses in time may be required.

To enhance the sensitivity of the n \u2212n search the supermirrors can be arranged in the shape of a truncated focusing ellipsoid [91]. The focusing reflector with a large acceptance aperture will intercept neutrons within a fixed solid angle and direct them by single reflection to the target.

The geometry of the reflector and the parameter m of the mirror material are chosen to maximize the sensitivity N n \u2022 t 2 for a given brightness of the source and a given size of the moderator and annihilation target.

For sensitivity (N n \u2022t 2 ) calculations, neutrons emitted from the surface of neutron moderator were traced through the detector configuration shown in Fig. 3 with gravity taken into account and with focusing reflector parameters that were adjusted by a partial optimization procedure. The flux of cold neutrons impinging on the annihilation detector target located at the distance L from the source was calculated after (mostly single) reflection from the focusing mirror. The time of flight to the target from the last reflection was also recorded. Each traced neutron contributed its t 2 to the total sensitivity figure N n \u2022 t 2 that was finally normalized to the initial neutron flux from the moderator.

Configurations of parameters that would correspond to even larger sensitivities are achievable, but for the baseline simulation shown in Fig. 5 we have chosen a set of parameters that we believe will be reasonably achievable and economical after inclusion of more engineering details than can be accommodated in our simulations to date. The optimal optical configuration for a n \u2212n search is significantly different from anything that has previously been built for materials research, so the full impact on the sensitivity of cost and other engineering considerations is not straightforward to predict. However representative parameters assumed for the optimization simulations (a source brightness of 3.5\u00d710 12 n/s-cm 2 -sec-MW and a moderator viewing area of 700 cm 2 ) are reasonable [118,141], the 200m vacuum tube length and the 2m 12 C target diameter are about a factor of 2 larger than the ILL experiment, and the 0.2sr solid angle of acceptance comes from the new high m supermirror guides and the elliptical geometry. Our conclusion from this exercise is that a n\u2212n oscillation experiment with a horizontal geometry using existing technology can without difficulty improve the limit on the oscillation probability by at least two orders of magnitude per year of operation assuming no background in the antineutron detector.",

Neutron spallation sources can be pulsed or continuous. Protons with energy 1-2 GeV interact with a spallation target producing high-energy particles (including protons, pions, muons, gammas) and most essentially neutrons with an energy range from MeV to GeV as well as the slower neutrons of interest. These high energy particles will produce a new background that was not present in previous reactor experiments [63,85,86]. At a pulsed spallation source the fast particle backgrounds can be excluded by vetoing data from the small fraction of time when the proton beam strikes the spallation target.

Of course, the shielding placed around the spallation target will greatly reduce these fluxes, but the requirement of a low attenuation path between the cold neutron source and the target means that some of this fast flux will escape. There are roughly 20 high energy neutrons produced in the spallation target per proton. These neutrons are extremely difficult to shield and can produce tracks in the calorimeter. High energy neutrons, protons and gammas can scatter in the target, creating spurious events which appear to originate from the target. Because the background rate in the detector depends heavily on the configuration and shielding of the source, beamline and detector, a realistic assessment of these backgrounds is challenging. We will return to this issue after we review other background sources.",

The beam halo was absorbed by boron-loaded glass collimators, and the beam dump was constructed of 6 Li-loaded tiles (the neutron absorption reaction in 6 Li emits no gammas, but it possesses a very small O(10 \u22125 ) branch for fast neutron production) [143]. These backgrounds do not produce track-like background but they greatly influence the trigger requirements, as the instantaneous energy deposition from these backgrounds is anticipated to be well over the desired energy threshold for annihilation events. For the envisioned next-generation experiment, there will be an enormous increase in the incident flux (on the order of factor of 100 to 1000) and an even larger increase in the beam which does not reach the target, resulting in more stringent requirements on the beam line shielding, detector granularity, tracking resolution, and trigger cuts.

Neutral CRs evade the CR veto and can produce events which originate from the target and beam tube, which were assessed to be the leading contributors to possible background in the signal window.

Since the high energy backgrounds reach the target in times less than about 10 \u00b5s, one can safely \"veto\" a time interval during and after the proton beam arrival, with essentially no impact to the \"live time\" of the cold neutron beam, which takes times on the order of 0.1 s to travel from the moderator to the target.

In comparison with detectors of Figure 7: A cross sectional view, perpendicular to the cold neutron beam axis, of the Institut Laue Langevin annihilation detector [90]. comparable scale and function in other nuclear and particle physics experiments, the n \u2212n detector doesn't require premium performance, but needs rather careful optimization of the cost due to its size. The detector should be built along the detector vacuum region with several layered detection subsystems (subsystems (ii) -(v)) and should cover a significant solid angle (coverage in the \u03b8-projection from \u223c20 \u2022 to 160 \u2022 corresponds to a solid angle acceptance of \u223c94%).

These backgrounds were absent from the ILL experiment, which produced fewer high energy particles in the reactor source and eliminated the residual fast backgrounds using a curved guide system to couple the cold source to the n \u2212n guide. We propose to integrate our shielding scheme for fast particles into the design of the source and beamline. The residual fast backgrounds at the detector are a strong function of the guide tube length, detector threshold, and pulse structure for the proton beam. In particular the natural pulsed structure of neutron spallation sources built to measure slow neutron energies using neutron time-of-flight is very useful as the source is off when the slow neutrons arrive at the annihilation target.",

The ATLAS TRT provides tracking for charged particles down to a transverse momentum of p T = 0.25 GeV with an efficiency above 90%. Tracks with lower transverse momentum loop in ATLAS' solenoidal magnetic field and are not reconstructible in the TRT. For tracks that have at least 15 TRT hits, a transverse momentum p T > 1.00 GeV, and are within 1.3 mm of the anode, the efficiency was found to be 94.4% for the 7 TeV ATLAS data with similar results for the 0.9 TeV ATLAS dataset [147]. For a cut of p T > 0.25 GeV, the efficiency drops down to 93.6%. For higher momentum tracks (e.g. p T > 15 GeV), the efficiency increases to 97%, and this is more indicative of the single-straw efficiency [148] as such tracks are essentially straight. The efficiency drops at the edges of the straw due to geometric and reconstruction effects.

In the optical-cascade approach the description of the elementar\u0233 N \u2212 N annihilation is based on the statistical model with SU(3) symmetry which allows the production of two to six intermediate particles. The intermediate particles can be \u03c0, \u03b7, \u03c9, \u03c1, K and K * mesons. Since neither the statistical model nor experiment can give precise and complete exclusive information about elementaryN \u2212 N annihilation, it seems reasonable to use the results of both together.

In ourn\u2212 12 C annihilation model we consider separately then annihilation on intranuclear protons and neutrons as those induce different reactions with a different number of possible final states.

This model can be used in then\u2212 12 C event generator for the detector design and optimization in a n\u2212n oscillation search experiment using a beam of cold neutrons. The model can be extended to other target nuclei for analysis of n \u2212n transitions of bound neutrons in the nucleus. The most important step in this model is to correctly set the initial conditions (stage 1) via then absorption probability function. A detailed treatment ofn \u2212 n annihilation modes in 12 C is under development. Here we present a list ofn \u2212 n annihilation modes in 16 O [93] (see Table 4), which we expect to be similar (but not identical) to those for 12 C. We are currently refining an event generator forn-andp-annihilation on 12 C nuclei using the GENIE Monte Carlo generator [165] (version 2.8.0). GENIE models the intranuclear propagation of mesons from the initialn \u2192 n or n \u2192 p vertex. Annihilation vertices are distributed in the 12 C nucleus according to a Gaussian nuclear density model with particle content given by the branching ratios in Table 4. GENIE uses the INTRANUKE INC simulation package, originally developed by the Soudan-2 Collaboration, to model the hadron transport inside the nucleus. Final state interactions are calculated using the hA mode of INTRANUKE, which simulates the intranuclear transport using the measured cross sections of each possible process instead of performing a full INC calculation. Stable final state particles including charged and neutral mesons, gammas, and proton and neutrons from nuclear fragmentation are recorded for input into the detector simulation. We are comparing the GENIE approach with the benchmark approach detailed at the beginning of this subsection in order to assess the effectiveness of the hA mode of INTRANUKE for the simulation of forn-andp-annihilation on 12 C nuclei.

As displayed in the left-hand side of Fig. 13, most of the signal mode events create hits in over half of the tracker and active calorimeter towers, where the tower numbering scheme is shown in Fig. 10. Requiring hits in at least two tracker towers, two active calorimeter towers and a minimum energy deposition of 450 MeV in the active calorimeter gives a signal mode acceptance of 96.18%. Trigger timing will play a key role in the comparison of signal to background. The timing in the active calorimeter has been studied for signal mode events, where the active calorimeter time of energy deposition in our studies has been calculated in reference to the first active calorimeter hit. The trigger timing window in the ILL experiment was 150 ns [167]. The majority of all signal mode events in our simulations deposit a large fraction of their energy within 50 ns after the first active calorimeter hit (see Fig. 14). Implementing the active calorimeter energy deposition and tower hit conditions described in the previous two paragraphs along with the requirement that all events deposit at least 500 MeV in the active calorimeter within 50 ns results in a signal mode acceptance of 91.74% for our simulations.

The optimization of the free n \u2212n oscillation experiment will rely on accurate simulation of not only the total number of neutrons but also their energy spectrum. Unlike the moderators at accelerator-based scattering facilities like the SNS, the emission time and spatial distribution of the neutrons from the moderator are largely irrelevant for this experiment. This allows one to exploit well-understood concepts for increasing moderator brightness (such as reentrant or grooved moderators) that are problematic at pulsed sources due to their complicated emission time distributions and beam intensity non-uniformities. Novel ideas such as the \"convoluted \"moderator, in which single crystals are placed within the moderator [168] or diamond nanoparticles as a slow neutron reflector around the moderator may provide significant improvements to the low-energy neutron flux from a moderator suitable for a n \u2212n oscillation search.",

In the cold neutron regime of most interest to optimizing the n \u2212n oscillation experiment, available scattering kernels for materials used in neutron moderation either do not model the relevant processes accurately or do not even exist. The reason for this perhaps surprising circumstance is that in the slow neutron regime there are strong interference effects in neutron scattering from condensed matter, and collective elementary excitations of the medium and their dispersion relations play a major role in determining the elastic and inelastic cross sections. As a result there is no universally-applicable treatment of the slow neutron moderation problem. This interaction is typically described in simulation codes through scattering kernels that attempt to model the relevant double differential cross section d 2 \u03c3 d\u2126dE as a function of energy and or incident direction in an efficient manner.",

The reflector material must also withstand the radiation damage and thermal load from the spallation target. The usual choice for a neutron reflector for a cold neutron moderator is either graphite or beryllium. However the low energy neutrons in the cold moderator possess de Broglie wavelengths which are large compared to the atom spacings in materials. In this case one can imagine neutron reflectors of enhanced reflectivity based on coherent scattering, and the longer time of flight of such low energy neutrons in the free flight region of the experiment can greatly improve the figure of merit. Recent experiments on mm-thick slabs of diamond nanoparticles show a large albedo due to this coherent scattering effect [169][170][171], and such nanoparticle composites should be highly immune to radiation damage. It should also be possible to combine this concept with other design choices such as the convoluted moderator or large parahydrogen moderator to realize compound gains in neutron flux. The optimal configuration for using these materials in the vicinity of the moderator is not yet known: it depends on many details such as the size and polydispersity of the nanoparticles and the absorption and incoherent scattering from contamination with residual hydrogen, which has already been identified as a limiting factor in existing measurements [171] and might be addressed through displacement with deuterium. Perhaps other materials (glassy carbon, alumina, ...) could provide even greater albedo for very cold neutrons. We are therefore very optimistic that new reflector materials can increase the cold neutron brightness from a moderator optimized for a n \u2212n oscillation experiment, but caution that experimental verification of these gains must be demonstrated before they could be considered for a role in an experimental design.",

As protons strike the spallation target, the slow neutrons take enough time to get from the source to the antineutron detector that they will arrive at the annihilation target well after most of the high-energy backgrounds consisting of fast neutrons, gammas, and charged particles. Vetoing the short time interval of proton pulses on the target can effectively remove this fast background together with reducing cold neutron flux by a few percent. The knowledge of the neutron energy spectrum from the moderator allows one to easily determine the neutron beam intensity on the annihilation target as a function of time and therefore also improves background discrimination and would also provide a consistency check should a set of several candidate events be found. Such improved background rejection features might be sufficient to allow for a straight path from the neutron source to the annihilation target which would improve the beam intensity (it is anticipated that a neutron bender would be needed in a CW source to get the antineutron target away from direct line-of-sight of the moderator).",

Since the speed and approximate angle of the neutron as it strikes a location on the reflector array is known at a pulsed neutron source from geometry and neutron time-of flight, one can imagine a neutron reflector tiled with individually adjustable elements whose orientations can be changed in phase with the source frequency. One could imagine this function being effected by piezoelectric transducers and optimized to reduce the transverse size of the neutron beam passing thought the magnetically-shielded vacuum chamber. Since the cost of the long vacuum chamber and magnetic shield for the experiment is roughly proportional to its cross sectional area, such an active array could be used to reduce the cost of the experiment.",

It has the advantage of forming a much more compact and therefore less expensive experiment than the long focusing arrangement needed for cold neutrons. Figure 15 indicates a possible realization. The hope is that the increased observation time for UCN can counteract the lower brightness of UCN sources relative to cold neutron sources, but again gravity introduces some limitations. Here the relevant advance lies mainly in the development of \"superthermal\"UCN sources, which promise higher brightness than achieved at the present ILL turbine facility. A UCN source based on solid D2 now operates at LANSCE and PSI, other solid D2-based UCN sources are under construction at FRM, and NC State, and superfluid helium-based UCN sources are under consideration at PNPI and under construction at TRIUMF. The brightest source now in operation (PSI) after optimization could foresee making enough UCN to improve the current limits in neutron antineutron oscillation time by about a factor of 7, corresponding to an improvement in the oscillation probability of a factor of 50.",

The integrated neutron detector efficiency for E n > 100 MeV was measured to be \u223c 10 \u22126 , a factor of 10 lower than Monte Carlo prediction in GEANT4. This discrepancy is partially because of gain reduction in the detector over the duration of a 625 \u00b5s beam pulse train. The measured event rate at the end of the beam pulse train was suppressed by a factor of 10 -10000 depending on the neutron flux intensity. This can be attributed to a build up of charge in the gas suppressing the gain and thereby reducing the trigger rate. Tubes filled with an Ar/ethane/CF 4 (50/7.25/42.75%) gas mixture, which is known to have a faster drift speed, suffered significantly less gain reduction.

To our knowledge a complete analysis has not been conducted, although an initial analysis for a certain subclass of operators has been performed [129]. Such an analysis could be useful in conjunction with specific models for n \u2212n oscillations and improved constraints on new processes from the LHC and other rare decay searches and symmetry tests to judge whether or not the interesting possibility of post sphaleron baryogenesis can be eliminated by laboratory experiments and (if so) what is the required experimental sensitivity. The prospect of eliminating an entire subclass of possible baryogenesis mechanisms through a null search for n \u2212n oscillations would be an attractive goal for an experiment, and establishing the experimental sensitivity required to do so would be of great interest. 2. Better calculations of the matrix elements of the 6-quark operators relevant for n \u2212n oscillations. These matrix elements are needed to relate the n \u2212n transition amplitude to the mass scale probed in the oscillation process. Existing calculations of the matrix elements of the 6-quark operators relevant for n \u2212n oscillations are quite old and use bag model wave functions that could give large errors. QCD based calculations are now becoming possible on the lattice as a byproduct of techniques developed to calculate slow neutron-nucleon parity violation amplitudes. We strongly encourage researchers to pursue these calculations. 3. A more thorough and quantitative analysis of the relationship between free neutron oscillations and n \u2212n oscillations in nuclei, including uncertainties due to the strong interaction. Among studies that could help illuminate this relationship we mention estimates of the relative sizes of the different modes of nucleon disappearance which can exist in nuclei in addition to direct n \u2212n oscillation and subsequent annihilation, and a QCD sum rule calculation of the conversion factor R, which would serve as a cross-check on existing calculations and have the benefit of a more direct connection to QCD. The simplicity of the deuteron and our detailed knowledge of its properties might well enable a more precise calculation of R that would inform the extraction of oscillation constraints from SNO.",

The physics is simple. In this energy regime the neutron-matter interaction is dominated by the strong neutron-nucleus interaction, and since the scattering is predominantly s-wave in this energy regime it can be parameterized by (accuratelymeasured) neutron scattering lengths. Also, since these energies are large compared to the kinetic energy and the binding energy of the atoms in the moderating medium, the total cross section is given to a good approximation by the incoherent sum of the scattering cross sections from the individual atoms in the medium. In this limit, therefore, the theory of neutron moderation only needs to apply energy and momentum conservation to a sequence of non-relativistic collisions of neutrons of mass m and initial energy E with target nuclei of mass M and zero kinetic energy, with probabilities given by the known cross sections. Such an analysis forms the core of neutron moderation theory in nuclear reactors [182][183][184]. For neutron moderation in hydrogen, the results are especially simple: the average energy after n collisions is simply < E n >= E 0 /2 n and the average number of collisions of a neutron with initial energy E 0 and final energy E is < n(E 0 , E) >= ln(E 0 /E) ln (2) . For a neutron with initial energy 1 MeV and final energy \u223c 1 eV, this number is about 15.",

As mentioned above, this process works well for collision energies above the binding energy of the protons in the medium. With the exception of free protons, however, whose dispersion relation is essentially the same as that for a free neutron and therefore possesses the optimum overlap needed for rapid phase space compression through collisions, at lower energies the dispersion relation for the elementary excitations in the medium which can cool the neutrons typically overlap the neutron dispersion relation E = p 2 2m only in some localized regions of (Q, \u03c9) space. In so-called superthermal neutron moderators optimized for the creation of ultracold neutrons [185] one concentrates on that small subset of processes in which the initial neutron phase space intersects the energy-momentum dispersion relation of the medium at one or a few points: for these cases the neutrons can lose virtually all their kinetic energy and momentum in one collision and come close to rest.

Since the phase space density in thermal equilibrium in a uniform medium is proportional to the Maxwell velocity distribution w( v) \u221d (m/kT ) 3/2 exp(\u2212mv 2 /2kT ), the phase space density increases as 1/T 3/2 as the distribution is cooled. In practice the finite neutron absorption cross section of all media (other than those composed of nuclei like 4 He, 2 H, 16 O, 12 C, and a few other nuclei which possess absorption cross sections of millibarns and below) places an upper bound on the number of collisions that can be tolerated, and then once again the amount of phase space compression per collision depends on the microscopic properties of the medium even at T = 0. Unfortunately the inelastic modes available in a condensed medium tend to freeze as T \u2192 0, thereby reducing the efficiency of the moderating medium even further [186]. This phenomenon is clearly observed in the neutron energy distributions measured from cold neutron sources. If one characterizes the energy distribution from a finite moderator medium at a temperature T approximately as a Maxwellian with an effective temperature T eff , not only is T eff > T but also the fractional deviation (T eff \u2212T ) T increases as T \u2192 0 in the cold neutron regime [187]. This is not difficult to understand for a simple solid: the energies of molecular vibrations lie above the cold neutron energy range, and the inelastic cross section in the limit as the moderator temperature T \u2192 0, which is dominated by one-phonon creation, becomes \u03c3 10 \u221d (E 0 /\u03c9 D ) 3 where \u03c9 D is the Debye frequency and therefore decreases as E 3 for small E.

The abnormally large scattering cross section of hydrogen, more an order of magnitude larger than for other nuclei, makes hydrogenous materials the obvious choice if the number of collisions for phase space cooling is not limited by the 0.3 barn neutron absorption cross section of hydrogen at 25 meV and its 1/ \u221a E increase at lower energies. The typical reduction of S(Q, \u03c9) with \u03c9 can, in some circumstances, be mitigated by employing materials with atypical dispersion in their excitation spectra. In CH 4 , for example, the partially-free rotational motion of the molecules leads to considerable spectral weight at low energies since these excitations are local rather than collective [189]. Other possible examples include disordered materials, which often possess an excess of low energy inelastic modes relative to phonons. Confinement of the moderating medium in porous media can greatly shift both its thermodynamic properties and its excitation spectra in addition to generating new local modes of atoms bound on the surface. On the other hand our poor understanding of disordered media, as demonstrated for example in the still-active controversy surrounding the physical explanation of the inelastic boson peak excitations around 1 meV observed in many disordered media, seems to preclude a general theoretical analysis.",

The optimization of a neutron moderator for a particular application is therefore a complicated task, in which suitable compromises must be struck between the often competing processes of elastic scattering, inelastic scattering, absorption, and neutron leakage out of the moderator (after all, it does no good to cool the neutrons if they do not end up in your experiment). In addition to this multidimensional optimization task, the designer must face engineering realities of heat removal, radiation tolerance and system service. The selection of materials and the physical geometry of both the moderator itself and its surrounding systems can play significant roles in determining the flux of neutrons available to the experimenter. Moderator design typically involves intensive computer simulations of proton, neutron, and photon transport through multiple materials in complex geometries. Unfortunately, today we have adequate kernels for modeling slow neutron transport through only very few of the relevant materials that could be used in constructing the next generation of cold neutron sources. Our inability to model slow neutron transport through real materials accurately can also have an impact on the ability to model accurately neutron-related backgrounds in rare decay and other low background environment experiments. There is, therefore, a need within the fundamental physics community for improving the available low-energy neutron data and for facilities that could be used to validate models that might be developed from those data.

Both interactions are spin-dependent and therefore possess two channels with J = I \u00b1 1/2. The coherent scattering length b is the sum of the scattering lengths in both scattering channels weighted by the number of spin states in each channel. From a quantum mechanical point of view, this is simply the total amplitude for a neutron to scatter without a change in the internal state of the target. The effect of the optical potential for a non-absorbing uniform medium with positive coherent scattering length is to slow down the neutrons as they encounter the potential step due to the matter, thereby decreasing the neutron wave vector, K, within the medium. A neutron index of refraction can be defined by this relative change in the magnitude of the wavevector n = K/k. Conservation of energy at the boundary determines the relation to the optical potential",

            "text": "Incoherent effects due to neutron absorption and incoherent scattering with the medium remove probability density from the coherent wave and can be modeled by adding an imaginary part to the optical potential whose magnitude is determined by the optical theorem of non-relativistic scattering theory. The scattering lengths therefore become complex and in general are also spin-dependent. It may seem counterintuitive that the attractive neutron-nucleus interaction can give rise to a repulsive neutron optical potential. For a weak potential there is indeed a one-to-one relation between the sign of the zero-energy scattering phase shift and the sign of the potential. The neutron-nucleus interaction is strong enough to form bound states, and therefore this perturbative intuition becomes inadequate. If one recalls Levinson's theorem from non-relativistic scattering theory, which says that the zero energy phase shift increases by \u03c0 for each bound state, one can see that it is possible for an attractive potential to produce a negative phase shift. Simple models [193] and more detailed treatments [194] of the neutron-nucleus interaction show that for most nuclei the scattering lengths are indeed positive, which corresponds to a repulsive optical potential. A summary of all neutron scattering lengths up to 1991 [195] and a set of recommended values [196] exist in the literature.",

We briefly examine these neutron sources and the process by which slow neutrons are produced starting from neutrons with energies several orders of magnitude greater. Neutrons are produced from fission in a research reactor at an average energy of 2 MeV. They are slowed to thermal energy in a moderator such as heavy or light water, graphite, or beryllium, surrounding the fuel. The peak core fluence rate of research reactors is typically in the range 10 14 n/cm 2 /s to 10 15 n/cm 2 /s. To maximize the neutron density it is necessary to increase the fission rate per unit volume, but the power density is ultimately limited by heat transfer and material properties. In the spallation process, protons (typically) are accelerated to energies in the GeV range and strike a high Z target, producing approximately 20 neutrons per proton with energies in the fast and epithermal region [179]. This is an order of magnitude more neutrons per nuclear reaction than from fission. Existing spallation sources yield neutron rates of 10 16 s \u22121 and 10 17 s \u22121 . Although the time-averaged fluence from spallation neutron sources is presently about an order of magnitude lower than for fission reactors, there is potentially more room for technical improvements in the near-term future due in part to the relaxation of the constraints needed to maintain a nuclear chain reaction [180] and from the potential for future developments in GeV proton accelerator technology. It is worth remembering that this paper has demonstrated that even in the absence of these improvements, a modern spallation source can host a free neutron oscillation experiment that could greatly improve upon the existing limits.",

At most reactors one obtains continuous beams with a thermalized Maxwellian energy spectrum. In a spallation source, neutrons arrive at the experiment while the production source is off, and the frequency of the pulsed source can be chosen so that",

The fundamental object of interest in neutron moderation is f ( r, v, t), the phase space distribution function, where f ( r, v, t)d rd v is the average number of neutrons in the phase space element d rd v at time t. Since the density of neutrons is orders of magnitude lower than the density of scatterers in a medium, neutron-neutron scattering can be ignored, and since the mean free path of neutrons in matter is much larger than the separation between atoms in the medium, the neutron motion between collisions can be approximated as classical motion with velocity v. This leads to a linear integral equation for the neutron phase space density of the form:",
