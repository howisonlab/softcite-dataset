Due to these limits, there is mounting tension in the ability of RPC SUSY models to explain the hierarchy problem with little fine tuning. These RPC SUSY searches, however, typically require signatures with significant missing transverse momentum (p miss T ) resulting from the undetected LSPs, while in R-parity violating (RPV) SUSY, the LSP is not stable and decays to SM particles, which removes the large p miss T signature.

The simplified model [29,30] that is used in the interpretation makes several assumptions about the SUSY mass spectrum. It is assumed that squarks other than the top squark are much heavier than the gluino, so they do not affect the gluino decay, and the branching ratio of g \u2192 t t \u2192 tbs is 100%. The top squark is assumed to be virtual in its decay. This results in a three-body decay, so searches for dijet resonances, i.e., t \u2192 bs, are not applicable in this scenario. It is further assumed that the gluinos decay promptly. An example diagram for this simplified model is shown in Fig. 1. Although this benchmark is used for interpreting results, the search is structured to be generically sensitive to high-mass signatures with large jet and bottom quark jet multiplicities and either little or no p miss T , which are potential features of other models of physics beyond the SM. Previous limits on such MFV models were obtained by the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations at \u221a s = 8 TeV [31][32][33] and by the ATLAS Collaboration at \u221a s = 13 TeV [34], excluding gluino masses below \u223c1 TeV and 1.6 TeV, respectively. This analysis searches in a single-lepton (electron or muon) final state for an excess of events with a large number of identified bottom quark (b-tagged) jets in regions determined as a function of the jet multiplicity and the sum of masses of large-radius jets, M J . Signal events are expected to contribute to this final state through the leptonic decay of one of the top quarks while populating the high jet multiplicity and high M J kinematic regions due to the hadronic decay of the second top quark and the additional bottom and strange quark jets. The four b quarks, two from the top quark decays and two from the top squark decays, provide a high b-tagged jet multiplicity signature. The quantity M J was proposed in phenomenological studies [35][36][37] and was first used for RPC SUSY searches by the ATLAS Collaboration in all-hadronic final states [38,39] and by the CMS Collaboration in single-lepton events [26,40].",

The central feature of the CMS detector is a superconducting solenoid of 6 m internal diameter, providing a magnetic field of 3.8 T. Within the solenoid volume are the charged particle tracking systems, composed of silicon-pixel and siliconstrip detectors, and the calorimeter systems, consisting of a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL), and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter. Muons are identified and measured by gas-ionization detectors embedded in the magnetic fluxreturn yoke outside the solenoid. A more detailed description of the CMS detector, together with a definition of the coordinate system used and the relevant kinematic variables, is given in Ref. [41]. The background predictions use Monte Carlo (MC) simulation samples with corrections to the normalization and shape of distributions measured in data control samples. MadGraph5_amc@nlo 2.2.2 is used in leading-order mode [42,43] to generate the tt, W + jet, quantum chromodynamics multijet (QCD), and Drell-Yan background processes with extra partons. Comparison to a powheg 2.0 [44][45][46] sample generated at next-to-leading order (NLO) shows that the NLO effects do not have a significant impact. The ttW, ttZ, tttt, and t-channel single top quark production backgrounds are generated with MadGraph5_amc@nlo 2.2.2 in NLO mode [47], while the tW, tW, and s-channel single top quark processes are generated with powheg 2.0. The tt, W + jet, and QCD samples are generated with up to 2, 4, 2 extra partons, respectively. All samples are generated using a top quark mass of 172.5 GeV and with the NNPDF3.0 set of parton distribution functions (PDF) [48]. For the fragmentation and showering of partons, the generated samples are interfaced with PYTHIA 8.205 [49] and use the CUETP8M1 tune to describe the underlying event [50]. All samples use the highest precision cross sections available [51][52][53][54][55][56][57]. The detector response is simulated with Geant4 [58]. Simulated samples are processed through the same reconstruction algorithms as the data.",

The uncertainty associated with lepton selection efficiency is determined by varying the efficiency to select a lepton within its uncertainty determined from data. The N lep distribution for QCD events may not be simulated well because it relies on modeling the tail of the fragmentation function and various detector effects. To account for this, an uncertainty of 20% is assigned to the relative normaliza- tion of QCD events in the 0-and 1-lepton bins, which is motivated by data-to-simulation studies of lepton isolation distributions. Jet energy scale uncertainties [67,73] are assessed by varying the p T of small-R jets as a function of p T and \u03b7. The uncertainty arising from jet energy resolution [67,73] is determined by applying an |\u03b7|-dependent factor to the jet p T to match the jet energy resolution observed in data. The integrated luminosity is varied according to its uncertainty of 2.5% [74], affecting only the backgrounds estimated from simulation. No uncertainty is applied for the amount of pileup as studies have shown its effect to be negligible in this high-H T selection. The uncertainties due to the limited size of simulation samples are incorporated as uncorrelated nuisance parameters in the fit.",

The background is predicted using a simultaneous fit in bins of the number of jets, number of b-tagged jets, and the sum of masses of large radius jets, using Monte Carlo simulated predictions with corrections measured in data control samples for the normalizations of the dominant backgrounds and nuisance parameters for theoretical and experimental uncertainties. Statistical uncertainties dominate in the signal regions, while the most important systematic uncer-   tainties arise from the modeling of gluon splitting and the b quark tagging efficiency and mistag rate. The observed data are consistent with the background-only hypothesis. An upper limit of approximately 10 fb is determined for the gluino-gluino production cross section using a benchmark R-parity violating supersymmetry model of gluino pair production with a prompt three-body decay to tbs quarks, as predicted in minimal flavor violating models. For this model, gluinos are observed (expected) to be excluded up to 1610 (1640) GeV at a 95% confidence level, which improves upon previous searches at \u221a s = 8 TeV [31][32][33] and is comparable to recent results at 13 TeV [34].",
