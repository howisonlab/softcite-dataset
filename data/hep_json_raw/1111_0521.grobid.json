A key aspect of the analysis is the correction of lifetime biasing effects, referred to as the acceptance, which are introduced by the selection criteria to enrich the B meson sample. Two complementary data-driven approaches have been developed to compensate for this bias. One method relies on extracting the acceptance function from data, and then applies this acceptance correction to obtain a measurement of the B 0 s \u2192 K + K \u2212 lifetime.

The detector includes a high precision tracking system which consists of a silicon vertex detector and several dedicated tracking planes with silicon microstrip detectors (Inner Tracker) covering the region with high charged particle multiplicity and straw tube detectors (Outer Tracker) for the region with lower occupancy. The Inner and Outer trackers are placed after the dipole magnet to allow the measurement of the charged particles' momenta as they traverse the detector. Excellent particle identification capabilities are provided by two ring imaging Cherenkov detectors which allow charged pions, kaons and protons to be distinguished from each other in the momentum range 2-100 GeV/c. The experiment employs a multi-level trigger to reduce the readout rate and enhance signal purity: a hardware trigger based on the measurement of the energy deposited in the calorimeter cells and the momentum transverse to the beamline of muon candidates, as well as a software trigger which allows the reconstruction of the full event information. B mesons are produced with an average momentum of around 100 GeV/c and have decay vertices displaced from the primary interaction vertex. Background particles tend to have low momentum and tend to originate from the primary pp collision. These features are exploited in the event selection. In the absolute lifetime measurement the final event selection is designed to be more stringent than the trigger requirements, as this simplifies the calculation of the candidate's acceptance function. The tracks associated with the final state particles of the B meson decay are required to have a good track fit quality (\u03c7 2 /ndf < 3 for one of the two tracks and \u03c7 2 /ndf < 4 for the other), have high momentum (p > 13.5 GeV/c), and at least one particle must have a transverse momentum of more than 2.5 GeV/c. The primary proton-proton interaction vertex (or vertices in case of multiple interactions) of the event is fitted from the reconstructed charged particles. The reconstructed trajectory of at least one of the final state particles is required to have a distance of closest approach to all primary vertices of at least 0.25 mm.",

            "text": "The absolute lifetime measurement method directly determines the effective B 0 s \u2192 K + K \u2212 lifetime using an acceptance correction calculated from the data. This method was first used at the NA11 spectrometer at CERN SPS [12], further developed within CDF [13,14] and was subsequently studied and implemented in LHCb [15,16]. The per-event acceptance function is determined by evaluating whether the candidate would be selected for different values of the B meson candidate decay time. For example, for a B meson candidate, with given kinematic properties, the measured decay time of the B meson candidate is directly related to the point of closest approach of the final state particles to the associated primary vertex. Thus a selection requirement on this quantity directly translates into a discrete decision about acceptance or rejection of a candidate as a function of its decay time. This is illustrated in Fig. 2. In the presence of several reconstructed primary interaction vertices, the meson may enter a decay-time region where one of the final state particles no longer fulfils the selection criteria with respect to another primary vertex. Hence the acceptance function is determined as a series of step changes. These turning points at which the candidates enter or leave the acceptance of a given primary vertex form the basis of extracting the per-event acceptance function in the data. The turning points are determined by moving the reconstructed primary vertex position of the event along the B meson momentum vector, and then reapplying the event selection criteria. The analysis presented in this Letter only includes events with a single turning point. The drop of the acceptance to zero when the final state particles are so far downstream that one is outside the detector acceptance occurs only after many lifetimes and hence is safely neglected.",

This analysis yields a lifetime value in good agreement with the current world average and of better statistical accuracy. The uncertainty on the comparison between the measured value and the world average is rescaled by the B meson and charm meson lifetime ratio. The uncertainty due to the fitting procedure is evaluated using simplified simulations. A large number of pseudo-experiments are simulated and the pull of the fitted lifetimes compared to the input value to the fit is used to estimate the accuracy of the fit. These sources of uncertainty are not dominant in the relative method, and are estimated from simplified simulations which also include the systematic uncertainty of the mass model.

Thirty bins between \u22121 ps and 35 ps are chosen such that each bin contains approximately the same number of B meson candidates. The ratio of the yields is then fitted as a function of decay time and the relative lifetime can be determined according to Eq. (3). With this approach it is not necessary to parametrise the decay-time distribution of the background. In order to maximise the statistical precision, both steps of the analysis are combined in a simultaneous fit to the K + K \u2212 and K + \u03c0 \u2212 invariant mass spectra across all decay-time bins.
