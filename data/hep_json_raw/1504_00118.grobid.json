            "text": "In addition to the effect of the temperature variation, the Cherenkov emission caused by cosmic-ray muons could be a source of systematic errors. Cherenkov photons would be emitted by cosmic-ray muons passing through the window of the PMT. If the PMT is located  at position S, some portion of emitted photons would be reflected by the mirror and re-enter into the PMT because of the optical configuration. On the other hand, no Cherenkov light is reflected back to the PMT if it is at position B. The most pessimistic evaluation of this effect without the black paper shield yields a count rate of \u223c 0.01 Hz, which would be larger than the statistical uncertainty for measurement over a week. In order to reduce this effect the effective area of the PMT was limited to 11 mm in diameter from its original size of 22mm in diameter. As the signal spot is well localized and the movement of the spot during a day  caused by the dark-matter 'wind' [21] is 2 mm, the efficiency of the measurement therefore would not be affected by this treatment. The effect of the Cherenkov light to the final result is estimated to be less than 2 \u00d7 10 \u22123 Hz in count rate with the limited effective area of the PMT, which potentially may cause a positive shift in the possible HPDM signal. However, we did not subtract this effect from N fit in eq. (3.1) and tried to estimate a conservative upper limit to it. Combining eq. (3.1) and the systematic error from the temperature variation, we obtain the possible count rate of the signal which originates from the existence of HPDM as N = (\u22121.9 \u00b1 3.8(stat.) \u00b1 0.5(sys.)) \u00d7 10 \u22123 Hz, which shows no significant evidence for the existence of HPDM. From this we calculate an upper limit of N UL95 = 6.4 \u00d7 10 \u22123 Hz at 95% confidence level. Making use of this value of photons detected at the PMT divided by the quantum efficiency of the PMT and the reflectivity of the mirror, and according to eq. (1.1), the upper limit to the mixing parameter \u03c7 is calculated assuming that DM is dominated by HP and that HPDM is not polarized and the direction is isotropically distributed in the celestial sphere, i.e. \u03b1 = 2/3. The result is shown in Fig. 5 with a red solid curve. The region allowed for HPDM [1] is filled with light reddish brown, and the excluded region from this experiment is overpainted with transparent red. The limit translated from the previous results for axion DM with the assumption that DM is mainly composed of HP [1] is marked as \"Haloscope\". Other filled areas are excluded by other experiments or considerations on astronomical sources.
