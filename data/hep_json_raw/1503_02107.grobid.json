Measurements in this energy range are important because neutrino oscillation experiments [2,3] need detailed understanding of the large variety of processes allowed. As a result, there is a growing body of new high-quality measurements for neutrino-nucleus interactions [4][5][6][7]. In particular, neutrino charged-current neutral pion production has become an important benchmark providing new challenges to theories describing this process [8][9][10][11].",

Only one data point for this channel in the few-GeV energy range exists in the literature: a measurement of \u03bd \u03bc p \u2192 \u03bc + n\u03c0 0 from SKAT in a heavy liquid (CF 3 Br) bubble chamber based on 20 events at an average neutrino energy of 7 GeV [12]. Measurements of \u03c0 0 production by neutrinos have been made in deuterium bubble chambers [13][14][15][16] and more recently on nuclear targets in the 0.1-1 GeV energy range using the MiniBooNE detector [17] with a mineral oil (CH 2 ) target, and using the SciBar detector in K2K and SciBooNE experiments [18,19] with plastic scintillator (CH). These recent measurements, as well as data on charged pion production [7,20] and neutral pion production [21] have been difficult for event generators and theoretical calculations to describe accurately [8][9][10][11]. Every prediction must have a model for \u03c0 0 production from nucleons; all use isospin decompositions within a helicity formalism that are tuned to available data [22].",

An accurate modeling of these particles requires knowledge of both the underlying neutrino-nucleon interactions and of the final-state modifications that arise within the target nuclei (such as carbon) of which the massive oscillation detectors are comprised. Pion production is a source of backgrounds and systematic uncertainties in neutrino oscillation experiments. Neutral-current \u03c0 0 production, for example, is a dominant background in \u03bd e (\u03bd e ) appearance experiments because the \u03c0 0 can mimic a final state electron (positron).

The antineutrino flux is estimated from a simulation of the neutrino beamline based on Geant4 [30,31], with hadron production in the simulation constrained by proton-carbon external data [32][33][34]. The MINERvA detector consists of a fully active region of scintillator strips surrounded on the sides and downstream end by electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters, and is described in detail in Ref. [35]. There are three orientations (views) for the strips (X, U, V), offset by 60 \u2022 from each other, which enable three-dimensional reconstruction of particle trajectories. The X view is sampled twice as often as the other views. The downstream edge of the MINERvA detector is located 2 m upstream of the MINOS Near Detector, a magnetized iron spectrometer [36] used in this analysis to reconstruct the momentum and charge of muons. The transport of particles from neutrino interactions in the detector is simulated by a Geant4-based program. The readout simulation is tuned so that both the photostatistics and the reconstructed energy deposited by momentum-analyzed through-going muons agree between data and the simulation. The detector simulation of single particle responses is validated using testbeam data taken with a scaled-down version of the MINERvA detector [37].",

For all models fitting data for light nuclei such as carbon, the pion most often has one interaction as it propagates through the nucleus. For each interaction, choice of the channel (e.g. charge exchange) is based on total cross section data and calculations [42,43] and the kinematics and multiplicity of the final state are taken from fits to more detailed data. At the energies important for this measurement, the hadron-nucleus cross sections have large uncertainties. For example, the cross section of \u03c0 \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 0 CEX on carbon has an uncertainty of about 50%. Reaction cross sections for \u03c0 0 are estimated from measured cross sections for \u03c0 \u00b1 scattering using isospin symmetry or theoretical models. The most significant advantages of the single interaction used in GENIE's FSI model are the ability to exactly reweight and to characterize each event with a single final state channel. The uncertainties in the FSI model are evaluated by varying its strength within previously measured hadron-nucleus cross-section uncertainties.",

The background distribution for each observable is estimated from the simulation with the total background rate constrained by data. This significantly reduces the uncertainties in the estimated background. The background rate is  The estimated background is subtracted from the total distribution. This background-subtracted data distribution is unfolded to account for detector resolution effects using a Bayesian unfolding method [46] with two iterations. The migration matrix used in the unfolding is obtained from the simulation. The total uncertainties on the measured cross sections are 20-25% with comparable contributions from statistical and systematic uncertainties. The largest systematic uncertainty is due to the integrated flux uncertainty at 10%. A detailed discussion of the flux systematic uncertainty is presented in Ref. [6]. The next largest contribution to the systematic uncertainty is the 8% normalization uncertainty from the background fit. The other smaller contributions include the neutrino cross-section models, FSI models, and detector simulation systematics. These systematic uncertainties enter the measured cross sections through background subtraction, detector resolution, and efficiency corrections. The neutrino crosssection model and FSI model uncertainties are evaluated by GENIE. The systematic uncertainties on the estimated background are small since the background rate is constrained by data. Systematic errors in the detector response must be independently estimated.  The uncertainty in neutron response is evaluated by changing the neutron inelastic cross section within experimental uncertainties [47][48][49][50][51][52][53][54] through event reweighting. The reweighting is applied to the leading neutron in the event. A large fraction of the secondary \u03c0 0 in the background is estimated to arise from \u03c0 \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 0 CEX, for which the cross sections are poorly known. The effect of this uncertainty on our measurement is evaluated by changing the CEX cross section within its uncertainty of \u00b150% [43,55,56], and then re-measuring the cross sections. Finally, the electromagnetic energy scale uncertainty (2.2%) is taken from the fitted mean uncertainty of the data m \u03b3 \u03b3 distribution. Flux-integrated single differential cross sections in \u03c0 0 momentum and angle with statistical, systematic, and total uncertainties are summarized in tables. 5 ",

Existence of both results provides stronger constraints on the calculations. The \u03c0 0 momentum range in this analysis is wider than the range shown for the charged pions of Ref.

Nevertheless, both analyses show that GENIE predictions are significantly improved when FSI are accounted for. Both results show a peak in the momentum distribution at p \u03c0 \u2248 0.2 GeV/c which is seen in the GENIE calculations, but do not have the correct distribution at energies near this peak.

The measurements are found to be in agreement with the predictions from GENIE, NuWro, and NEUT event generators. This agreement is interesting because of the approximations needed to make predictions for this channel. The measured cross section in \u03c0 0 momentum disfavors the GENIE prediction without FSI effects at low \u03c0 0 momentum, which is not surprising since FSI is expected for hadrons inside nuclei. A decomposition of the FSI effects shows that inelastic scattering and CEX reactions are responsible for the peak at p \u03c0 \u2248 0.2 GeV/c. These contributions could be adjusted within external experimental errors to achieve even better agreement of calculations with the \u03c0 0 momentum data. However, these changes would not be as effective for the \u03c0 0 polar angle.",

Above 0.7 GeV/c, FSI effects have little influence on the \u03c0 0 momentum distribution, and both predictions are in good agreement with the data. For momenta below 0.3 GeV/c, inclusion of FSI gives an increased and shifted cross section relative to the no FSI case. This trend is exhibited by the data; GENIE calculations with and without FSI give a \u03c7 2 of 25.4 and 50.0 for 11 degrees of freedom (dof), respectively. For the distribution of \u03c0 0 production angle in Fig. 3, inclusion of FSI into the GENIE simulation results in a mild flattening of the distribution with no significant improvement in the \u03c7 2 compared to the no FSI case, 16.7 versus 16.0 for 11 degrees of freedom. Thus the effects of FSI are more pronounced with respect to \u03c0 0 momenta than with \u03c0 0 production angle. This situation likely reflects the influence of the (1232) resonance, which gives a particularly strong momentum dependence to the pion-nucleus interaction for p \u03c0 \u2248 0.26 GeV/c where the pion-carbon cross section is maximum. Figs. 2 and 3 also show predictions including FSI from the NuWro and NEUT event generators. Any prediction requires knowledge of \u03bd \u03bc N \u2192 \u03bc + \u03c0 0 N reactions.
