The CDF collaboration reported a 3:8 evidence for the X\u00f04140\u00de state (also referred to as Y\u00f04140\u00de in the literature) in these decays using p \" p data collected at the Tevatron ( ffiffi ffi s p \u00bc 1:96 TeV) [2].

            "text": "Charmonium states at this mass are expected to have much larger widths because of open flavour decay channels [5]. Thus, their decay rate into the J=c mode, which is near the kinematic threshold, should be small and unobservable. Therefore, the observation by CDF has triggered wide interest among model builders of exotic hadronic states. It has been suggested that the X\u00f04140\u00de resonance could be a molecular state [6][7][8][9][10][11][12], a tetraquark state [13,14], a hybrid state [15,16] or a rescattering effect [17,18]. The Belle experiment found no evidence for the X\u00f04140\u00de state in the ! J=c process, which disfavored the molecular interpretation [19]. The CDF data also suggested that there could be a second state at a mass of 4274:4 \u00fe8:4 \u00c06:4 AE 1:9 MeV with a width of 32:3 \u00fe21:9 \u00c015:3 AE 7:6 MeV [3]. In this case, the event yield was 22 AE 8 with 3:1 significance. This observation has also received attention in the literature [20,21].",

            "text": "The LHCb detector [22] is a single-arm forward spectrometer covering the pseudorapidity range 2 < < 5, designed for the study of particles containing b or c quarks. The detector includes a high precision tracking system consisting of a silicon-strip vertex detector surrounding the pp interaction region, a large-area silicon-strip detector located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4 Tm, and three stations of silicon-strip detectors and straw drift-tubes placed downstream. The combined tracking system has a momentum resolution \u00c1p=p that varies from 0.4% at 5 GeV=c to 0.6% at 100 GeV=c, and an impact parameter (IP) resolution of 20 m for tracks with high transverse momentum. Charged hadrons are identified using two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors. Photon, electron and hadron candidates are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) and a hadronic calorimeter (HCAL). Muons are identified by a muon system (MUON) composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers. The MUON, ECAL and HCAL provide the capability of first-level hardware triggering. The single and dimuon hardware triggers provide good efficiency for B \u00fe ! J=c K \u00fe , J=c ! \u00fe \u00c0 events. Events passing the hardware trigger are read out and sent to an event filter farm for further processing. Here, a software based two-stage trigger reduces the rate from 1 MHz to about 3 kHz. The most efficient software triggers [23] for this analysis require a charged track with transverse momentum (p T ) of more than 1.7 GeV (p T > 1:0 GeV if identified as muon) and with an IP to any primary pp-interaction vertex (PV) larger than 100 m. A dimuon trigger requiring p T \u00f0\u00de > 0:5 GeV, large dimuon mass, M\u00f0 \u00fe \u00c0 \u00de > 2:7 GeV, and with no IP requirement complements the single track triggers. At final stage, we either require a J=c ! \u00fe \u00c0 candidate with p T > 1:5 GeV or a muon-track pair with significant IP.",

Alternatively requiring the invariant mass M\u00f0J=c K \u00fe K \u00c0 K \u00fe \u00de to be within AE2:5 standard deviations of the observed B \u00fe peak position, we fit the M\u00f0K \u00fe K \u00c0 \u00de mass distribution (two combinations per event) using a binned maximum likelihood fit with a P-wave relativistic Breit-Wigner representing the \u00f01020\u00de and a two-body phase-space distribution to represent combinatorial background, both convolved with a Gaussian mass resolution.

According to the fit to the M\u00f0K \u00fe K \u00c0 \u00de distribution this requirement is 85% efficient. Figure 3 shows the mass difference M\u00f0J=c \u00de \u00c0 M\u00f0J=c \u00de distribution (no J=c or mass constraints have been used). No narrow structure is observed near the threshold. We employ the fit model used by CDF [3] to quantify the compatibility of the two measurements. The data are fitted with a spin-zero relativistic Breit-Wigner shape together with a three-body phase-space function (F bkg 1 ), both convolved with the detector resolution. The efficiency dependence is extracted from simulation ( Fig. 4) and applied as a shape correction to the three-body phase-space and the Breit-Wigner function. The mass and width of the X\u00f04140\u00de peak are fixed to the central values obtained by the CDF collaboration. The mass-difference resolution was determined from the B \u00fe ! X\u00f04140\u00deK \u00fe simulation to be 1:5 AE 0:1 MeV. A binned maximum likelihood fit of the signal and background yields is shown in Fig. 3(a). The region above 1400 MeV is excluded since it is more likely to contain non B \u00fe ! J=c K \u00fe backgrounds. By excluding also the region below 1030 MeV, where the three-body phase-space and signal yields are very small (0.5% and 3.5% of the yields included in the fit, respectively), we make our results less vulnerable to possible small contributions from the other sources. The fit shown in Fig. 3(a) gives a X\u00f04140\u00de yield of 6:9 AE 4:9 events. Fitting the  [26,27] and possible broad J=c resonances can also contribute near and under the narrow X\u00f04140\u00de resonance. To explore the sensitivity of our results to the assumed background shape, we also fit the data in the 1020-1400 MeV range with a quadratic function multiplied by the efficiency-corrected three-body phase-space factor (F bkg 2 ) to impose the kinematic threshold. The preferred value of the X\u00f04140\u00de yield is 0.6 events with a positive error of 7.1 events. This fit is shown in Fig. 3(b).",

Using our B \u00fe ! J=c K \u00fe yield multiplied by this efficiency ratio and by the CDF value for B\u00f0B \u00fe ! X\u00f04140\u00deK \u00fe \u00de=B\u00f0B \u00fe ! J=c K \u00fe \u00de [3], leads to a prediction that we should have observed 35 AE 9 AE 6 events, where the first uncertainty is statistical from the CDF data and the second includes both the CDF and LHCb systematic uncertainties. Given the B \u00fe yield and relative efficiency, our sensitivity to the X\u00f04140\u00de signal is a factor of 2 better than that of the CDF. The central value of this estimate is shown as a dashed line in Fig. 3. Taking the statistical and systematic errors from both experiments into account, our results disagree with the CDF observation by 2:4 (2:7) when using F bkg 1 (F bkg 2 ) background shapes. Since no evidence for the X\u00f04140\u00de state is found, we set an upper limit on its production. Using a Bayesian approach, we integrate the fit likelihood determined as a function of the X\u00f04140\u00de yield and find an upper limit on the number of signal events of 16 (13) at 90% confidence level (CL) for the two background shapes. Dividing the least stringent limit on the signal yield by the B \u00fe ! J=c K \u00fe yield and \u00f0B \u00fe ! X\u00f04140\u00deK \u00fe \u00de=\u00f0B \u00fe !

This uncertainty includes the statistical error from the simulation as well as the observed differences in track reconstruction efficiency between the simulation and data measured with the inclusive J=c ! \u00fe \u00c0 signal. Fit systematics related to the detector resolution and the uncertainty in the shape of the efficiency dependence on the J=c mass were also studied and found to be small.
