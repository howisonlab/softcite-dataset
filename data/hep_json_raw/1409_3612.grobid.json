            "text": "High centre-of-mass energies available in proton-proton collisions at the LHC allow models describing charmonium production to be tested. We distinguish promptly produced charmonia from those originating from b-hadron decays. Promptly produced charmonia include charmonia directly produced in parton interactions and those originating from the decays of heavier quarkonium states, which are in turn produced in parton interactions. While measurements of J/\u03c8 and \u03c8(2S) meson production rates at the LHC [1][2][3][4][5][6] are successfully described by next-to-leading order (NLO) calculations in non-relativistic quantum chromodynamics (QCD) [7], the observation of small or no polarization in J/\u03c8 meson prompt production [2] remains unexplained within e-mail: sergey.barsuk@cern.ch the available theoretical framework [8]. The investigation of the lowest state, the \u03b7 c (1S) meson, can provide important additional information on the long-distance matrix elements [9,10]. In particular, the heavy-quark spin-symmetry relation between the \u03b7 c (1S) and J/\u03c8 matrix elements can be tested, with the NLO calculations predicting a different dependence of the production rates on charmonium transverse momentum, p T , for spin singlet (\u03b7 c (1S)) and triplet (J/\u03c8, \u03c7 cJ ) states [11][12][13]. Thus, a measurement of the p T dependence of the \u03b7 c (1S) production rate, in particular in the low p T region, can have important implications. Recent LHCb results on prompt production of \u03c7 c states [14] provide information on the production of the P-wave states \u03c7 c0 and \u03c7 c2 at low p T , using the well-understood \u03c7 c1 production as a reference. A measurement of the cross-section of prompt \u03b7 c (1S) production may allow an important comparison with the \u03c7 c0 results and yields indirect information on the production of heavier states.",

This paper extends the scope of previous charmonium production studies reported by LHCb, which were restricted to the use of J/\u03c8 or \u03c8(2S) decays to dimuon final states [1,2,14,19]. In order to explore states that do not have J PC = 1 \u2212\u2212 quantum numbers, while avoiding reconstruction of radiative decays with low-energy photons, the authors of Ref. [20] suggested to investigate hadronic final states. In the present analysis, we reconstruct \u03b7 c (1S) mesons decaying into the p p final state. All well-established charmonium states decay to p p final states [20,21]. With its powerful charged-hadron identification and high charmonium production rate, the LHCb experiment is well positioned for these studies. The measurements are performed relative to the topologically and kinematically similar J/\u03c8\u2192pp channel, which allows partial cancellation of systematic uncertainties in the ratio. This is the first such inclusive analysis using decays to hadronic final states performed at a hadron collider.",

Uncertainties due to limited knowledge of the detector mass resolution are estimated by assigning the same \u03c3 a value to the \u03b7 c (1S) and J/\u03c8 signal description for the bhadron sample, and by varying the \u03c3 a parameters in the prompt production analysis within their uncertainties. Uncertainties associated with the J/\u03c8 polarization in the prompt production reflect those of the polarization measurement in Ref. [2]. We evaluate a potential contribution from J/\u03c8 polarization in b-hadron decays using a BaBar study [32] of the J/\u03c8 polarization in inclusive decays of B mesons. Simulations are used to estimate the effective polarization parameter for the LHCb kinematic region where the b-hadrons have a high boost and the longitudinal polarization is significantly reduced. A conservative value for the polarization parameter of \u22120.2 is used to estimate the corresponding systematic uncertainty. In order to estimate the systematic uncertainty associated with the \u03b7 c (1S) natural width, which enters the results for the prompt production analysis, the world average \u03b7 c (1S) value of 32.0 MeV from Ref. [21] is used. Possible differences of the prompt charmonium production spectra in data and simulation are estimated by correcting the efficiency derived from simulation according to the observed p T distribution. The uncertainty related to the cross-feed is estimated by varying the signal yields in each sample according to their uncertainties. Uncertainties associated with the background description are estimated by using an alternative parametrization and varying the fit range. The uncertainty due to the contribution from the J/\u03c8\u2192pp\u03c0 0 decay is dominated by the modelling of the pp invariant mass shape, and is estimated by using an alternative parametrization, which is linear instead of the square root. Possible systematic effect related to separation between prompt and b-decays samples, was checked by varying the t z discriminant value from 80 to 120 fs. The results are found to be stable under variation of the value of the t z discriminant, and no related systematic uncertainty is assigned. Table 1 lists the systematic uncertainties for the production yield ratio. The total systematic uncertainty is estimated as the quadratic sum of the uncertainties from the sources listed in Table 1 and, in the case of the prompt production measurement, is dominated by the uncertainty associated with the \u03b7 c (1S) natural width. For the measurement with b-hadron decays the uncertainties associated with the background model, the J/\u03c8 polarization and the cross-feed provide significant contributions.",
