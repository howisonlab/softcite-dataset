            "text": "The study of charmonium production provides an important test of the underlying mechanisms described by quantum chromodynamics (QCD). In pp collisions charmonia can be produced directly, or indirectly via the decay of higher excited states (feed-down) or via the decay of b hadrons. The first two are referred to as prompt production. The mechanism for the production of the prompt component is not yet fully understood, and none of the available models adequately predicts both the transverse momentum spectrum and the polarization of the promptly produced charmonium states [1]. At the LHC, cc pairs are expected to be produced at leading order (LO) through gluongluon interactions, followed by the formation of bound charmonium states. The production of the cc pair is described by perturbative QCD while non-perturbative QCD is needed for the description of the evolution of the cc pair to the bound state. Several models have been developed for the non-perturbative part, such as the Colour Singlet (CS) model [2][3][4] and the non-relativistic QCD (NRQCD) model [5]. The CS model assumes the cc pair is created in a hard scattering reaction as a colour singlet with the same quantum numbers as the final charmonium state. The NRQCD model includes, in addition to the colour singlet mechanism, the production of cc pairs as colour octets (CO) (in this case the CO state evolves to the final charmonium state via soft gluon emission). These two models predict different ratios of the \u03c7 c2 to \u03c7 c1 production cross-sections.",

The combined tracking system provides a momentum measurement with relative uncertainty that varies from 0.4% at 5 GeV/c to 0.6% at 100 GeV/c, and impact parameter resolution of 20 \u00b5m for tracks with high transverse momentum. Charged hadrons are identified using two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors. Electron and hadron candidates are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad (SPD) and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) and a hadronic calorimeter. The SPD and preshower are designed to distinguish between signals from photons and electrons. The ECAL is constructed from scintillating tiles interleaved with lead tiles. The reconstruction of converted photons that are used in this analysis is described in section 3. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers. The total radiation length before the first tracking station is about 0.25X 0 [14].",

The fraction of peaking background is therefore estimated in two regions of p J/\u03c8 T , below and above 9 GeV/c, and the maximum deviation from the mean value inside each range (as predicted by simulation) is taken as a systematic uncertainty.

This assertion is based on the similar values for B(b \u2192 \u03c7 c1 X) and B(b \u2192 \u03c7 c0 X) [23] and the small contamination of b \u2192 \u03c7 c1 X decays as shown above.

The shape of the combinatorial background is estimated using the selected data sample by generating \"fake photons\" to mimic the candidate photon spectra in data. For each \u03c7 c \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03b3 candidate, two fake photons are generated: one where the photon energy is set equal to twice the e \u2212 energy, and a second where twice the e + energy is used.

Since the kinetic energy released in the \u03c7 c1 decay (Q-value) is smaller than that of the \u03c7 c2 decay, the photon p T spectrum differs for the two decays. As a result, the photon p T requirement (p \u03b3 T > 0.6 GeV/c) has a lower efficiency for the \u03c7 c1 decay. Moreover the reconstruction efficiency of the converted photon decreases as the photon p T decreases. This is due to the fact that low energy electrons escape the detector before reaching the calorimeter and are therefore not identified as electrons. Thus, the efficiency ratio is expected to be smaller than unity. The value obtained from simulation is \u03b5 \u03b3 \u03c7 c1 /\u03b5 \u03b3 \u03c7 c2 = 0.95 \u00b1 0.01 and shows no significant dependence on p J/\u03c8 T . The conversion probability and total efficiency for converted photons is cross-checked using \u03c0 0 mesons, reconstructed either with two calorimetric photons or with one calorimetric photon and one converted photon. The ratio of efficiencies of converted photons to calorimetric photons is measured in data and simulation as a function of p \u03b3 T and is shown in figure 2(a). The total efficiency for calorimetric photons is described well by simulation [25] therefore these measurements give a direct comparison of the converted photon efficiency in data and simulation. The efficiency with which converted photons are reconstructed in simulation is consistent with data (within about 15%). The results obtained from this study are used to correct the simulation. The corrected \u03b5 \u03b3 \u03c7 c1 /\u03b5 \u03b3 \u03c7 c2 ratio is shown as a function of p J/\u03c8 T in figure 2(b).

For the \u03c7 c0 to \u03c7 c2 ratio the corrected efficiency ratio is \u03b5 \u03c7 c2 /\u03b5 \u03c7 c0 = 1.69 \u00b1 0.18.
