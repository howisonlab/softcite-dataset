These asymmetries result from the interference of the Bethe-Heitler process and of deeply virtual Compton scattering. Over the whole kinematic range (x B from 0.11 to 0.58, Q 2 from 1 to 4:8 GeV 2 , \u00fft from 0.09 to 1:8 GeV 2 ), the azimuthal dependence of the asymmetries is compatible with expectations from leading-twist dominance, A ' a sin=1 c cos. This extensive set of data can thus be used to constrain significantly the generalized parton distributions of the nucleon in the valence quark sector.",

Elastic electron scattering measures form factors which reflect the spatial shape of charge distributions [1], while deep inelastic scattering provides access to parton distribution functions that encode, in a fast moving nucleon, the momentum fraction carried by the constituents [2]. The formalism of generalized parton distributions (GPDs) [3][4][5] unifies these approaches and provides much greater insight into nucleon structure [6,7], through the coherence between states of different longitudinal momentum fractions, the correlation between transverse coordinates and longitudinal momentum of the partons [8], the distribution of forces exerted upon partons [9] (information inconceivable to obtain just a few years ago) and the angular momentum carried by each type of parton [4].",

For this purpose, a new inner calorimeter (IC) was added to the standard CLAS configuration, 55 cm downstream from the target, in order to detect 1 to 5 GeV photons emitted between 4.5 and 15 with respect to the beam direction. This calorimeter was built of 424 tapered lead-tungstate crystals, 16 cm-long and with an average cross-sectional area of 2:1 cm 2 , read out with avalanche photodiodes and associated low-noise preamplifiers. The whole IC was operating at a stabilized temperature of 17 C, and monitored with laser light homogeneously distributed on all crystals. The calorimeter was calibrated several times during the run using the two-photon decay of neutral pions. Energy and angle resolutions of 4.5% and 4 mrad (for 1 GeV photons) were achieved. In conjunction, a specifically designed superconducting solenoid was used to trap around the beam axis the background originating from M\u00f8ller electrons, while permitting detection of the recoil protons up to 60 .",

When combined with other observables more sensitive toH and E, as well as with unpolarized cross sections, it will be possible to obtain the real and imaginary parts of the Compton form factors of all GPDs, as defined in Eqs. 3and (4). Additional theoretical work is also required, to clarify how power-suppressed contributions not included in Ref. [19] would affect the relations between observables and GPDs [24]. Presently, GPDs may be calculated using theoretical models based on constituent quarks, on a chiral quark-soliton description of the nucleon, on light-cone or other frameworks. The first moments of GPDs are being calculated using lattice QCD techniques. But none of these calculations are developed to the point of making the link to DVCS observables. Alternatively, constrained parameterizations have been used to make predictions of DVCS beam-spin asymmetries. Following Refs. [25,26], such a parameterization of the GPD H may be ",
