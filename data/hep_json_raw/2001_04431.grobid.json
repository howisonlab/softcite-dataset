            "text": ": A muon collider represents the ideal machine to reach very high center-of-mass energies and luminosities by colliding elementary particles. This is the result of the low level of beamstrahlung and synchrotron radiation compared to linear or circular electron-positron colliders. In contrast with other lepton machines, the design of a detector for a multi-TeV muon collider requires the knowledge of the interaction region due to the presence of a large amount of background induced by muon beam decays. The physics reaches can be properly evaluated only when the detector performance is determined. In this work, the background generated by muon beams of 750 GeV is characterized and the performance of the tracking system and the calorimeter detector are illustrated. Solutions to minimize the effect of the beam-induced background are discussed and applied to obtain track and jet reconstruction performance. The \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 \u2192 H\u03bd\u03bd \u2192 bb\u03bd\u03bd process is fully simulated and reconstructed to demonstrate that physics measurements are possible in this harsh environment. The precision on Higgs boson coupling to bb is evaluated for \u221a s = 1.5, 3, and 10 TeV and compared to other proposed machines.",

            "text": "In a multi-TeV muon collider, the effects of the background induced by the muon beam decays need to be evaluated in detail at the detector level to be able to estimate the physics reach. In fact, the muon decay products can contaminate the Interaction Region (IR) from a distance that varies with the beam energy and the collider optics and its superconducting magnets, with appropriate protective elements, need to be designed and included in the simulations [1] to have an accurate background description. Previous studies [2][3][4] have found that two cone-shaped tungsten shields can be used to protect the IR and the detector from the extremely high flux of beam background particles. As a consequence, the exact design of the machine-detector interface (MDI), which includes these shields, is needed to evaluate the distribution of the induced background at any part of the detector. The beam-induced background generated by the MAP collaboration [5] with the IR and the MDI optimized for 1.5-TeV center-of-mass energy [3] are used to study the effect on the tracking system and on the calorimeter detector. The software framework used for the propagation of the beam-induced background through the detector is inherited from the MAP collaboration and has been further developed to obtain the final results. The production and decay of the Higgs boson \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 \u2192 H\u03bd\u03bd \u2192 bb\u03bd\u03bd at \u221a s = 1.5 TeV is studied to determine the reconstruction and identification efficiencies, that are used to evaluate the sensitivity to the bb coupling. Samples of \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 \u2192 H\u03bd\u03bd \u2192 bb\u03bd\u03bd at particle level are generated also at \u221a s = 3, 10 TeV and a conservative calculation of the sensitivities at these energies is presented.",

[3,4] and in Ref. [7]. The background particles reaching the detector are mainly produced by the interactions of the decay products of the muon beams with the machine elements. Their type, flux, and characteristics strongly depend on the machine lattice and the interaction point configuration, which in turn depend on the collision energy. The background particles may be produced tens of meters upstream the interaction point, as can be seen in Figure 1. Therefore, a detailed layout of the machine and the machine-detector interface must be included in the simulation. In particular, the opening angle of two shielding cones (\"nozzles\"), introduced to mitigate the effects of the beam-induced background inside the detector, must be optimized for a specific beam energy and it will affect the detector acceptance.

The shielding nozzles, described in the text, are represented in yellow inside the detector. This figure has been reproduced from Ref. [8].",

Their main properties are a relatively low momentum and an arrival time in each sub-detector asynchronous with respect to the beam crossing. Figure 2 shows the momentum spectra of the electromagnetic (left) and hadronic (central) components of the beam-induced background for a muon beam of 750 GeV. The first one is relatively soft ( p ph. = 1.7 MeV and p el. = 6.4 MeV), whereas the second one has an average momentum of about half a GeV ( p n = 477 MeV and p ch.had. = 481 MeV). The time of arrival of the particles at the detector entry point with respect to the bunch crossing time for the different background components is shown on the right of Figure 2. The peaks that are evident around zero are primarily due to the leakage of photons and electrons around the interaction point, where the shielding is minimal.",

            "text": "Hits surviving the selection discussed in Section 3 are used as an input to a parallel Kalman filter, as implemented in the ILCRoot framework. Pattern recognition and track finding are performed simultaneously with an iterative procedure with increasing search windows for hits in the following tracker layers at each iteration. This method guarantees high tracking efficiency, but requires significant computing resources and long processing times. With the available code, only four iterations were feasible for events with beam-induced background. Figure 7 shows the tracking efficiency evaluated in a sample of muons as a function of transverse momentum (p T ) and pseudorapidity (\u03b7) for different numbers of iterations. The tracking efficiency is defined as the fraction of generated particles in the tracker geometrical acceptance that are matched to a good-quality reconstructed track. The effect of fewer iterations in the track finding procedure is a drop in efficiency for low-p T and high-\u03b7 particles. Four iterations represented a good trade-off between an acceptable reconstruction efficiency and a practical processing time. As an example, the tracking of one beam-induced background event, \u223c60000 tracks with p T > 0.5 GeV, takes approximately one hour on an Intel Xeon CPU E5-2665 2.40GHz with 32GB RAM in the case of four iterations with a CPU time that increases non-linearly with the number of iterations. The track reconstruction performance is assessed in samples of single muons generated at different momenta and pseudorapidities. In the left panel of Figure 8 is shown the tracking efficiency as a function of the transverse momentum for three representative values of |\u03b7|: the tracker central region, the forward region and the crack between the two. As expected, there is a loss of efficiency at low momentum, which is more evident on the right panel, where the efficiency is plotted as a function of |\u03b7| for three different momentum values. Low efficiency at high \u03b7 is expected both due to the lower performance of the reconstruction algorithm and the limited coverage of the detector because of the shielding nozzles. The relative transverse momentum resolution of the reconstructed tracks is reported in Figure 9 for samples of single muons. The left panel shows the track p T resolution as a function of p T in different |\u03b7| regions. In the central and forward regions the p T resolution is lower than 5 \u00d7 10 \u22124 GeV \u22121 for p T > 10 GeV, while tracks reconstructed in the crack between the central layers and the forward disks present a degraded resolution. The right panel shows the p T resolution as a function of pseudorapidity for muons with p = 1, 10, 100 GeV. The resolution degrades visibly for tracks of low momentum and high |\u03b7|.  T , where \u2206p T is the difference between the generated muon p T and the p T of the corresponding reconstructed track.",

Since the Higgs boson production at \u221a s = 1.5 TeV is dominated by WW fusion [7] the H \u2192 bb production cross section (\u03c3) is related to the Higgs boson couplings as follows:  where g HWW is the coupling of the Higgs boson to the W boson and \u0393 H is the Higgs boson width.

In principle, with a combined fit to the di-jet invariant mass and discriminating kinematic variables, it should be possible to disentangle the signal from the background, thus reducing the uncertainty on the cross section. In this study, a conservative estimate based on equation 5.3 is used to evaluate the uncertainty on the cross section. The contribution to the background events comes from two sources: physics processes and uncorrelated background. The first contribution is evaluated with Monte Carlo simulation. The Standard Model processes considered as possible background are listed in Table 1. The number of background events with bb final states have been estimated by applying reconstruction and btagging efficiencies to generator-level samples produced with Pythia 8. The contribution of light quark events, for example those with two b\u2212tags in the final state, due mainly to beam-induced background, has been calculated applying the same procedure used for physics processes. In this case, however, the tagging mis-identification rate is used instead of the b-tagging efficiency. The fake-jet contribution, after the b-tagging requirements, is considered negligible. The number of expected background events after considering all the contributions, is B = 6700. At this point it is possible to evaluate the uncertainty on the cross section by using equation 5.3, \u2206\u03c3 \u03c3 = 2.0%. According to equation 5.1, it is necessary to also know g HWW and \u0393 H in order to determine g H bb . Knowledge of the H \u2192 bb cross section is not enough. In the following, it is assumed that g HWW and \u0393 H can be measured with the same level of precision expected by CLIC at \u221a s = 1.4 TeV [13]. This is justified by the fact that the selection of muonic final states at a muon collider is analogous to that at electron-positron accelerators, since the beam-induced background stops at the calorimeters and is not expected in muon detectors. Therefore the uncertainty on the coupling can be obtained with:",
