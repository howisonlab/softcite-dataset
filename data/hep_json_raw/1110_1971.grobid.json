The neutrino and anti-neutrino production rates at the interaction point would be equal in forward and backward directions. By mounting a neutrino detector at \u223c300 m away from the interaction point, one can perform a neutrino experiment parasitically without interrupting the LHC physics program during the collider run. And also, this detector would provide an unique opportunity for a long-lived metastable particle searche, for example, the scalar tau lepton [2,3] in Supersymmetric extension of gravity, as well as neutrino physics. Another advantage of this experiment is that the neutrino fluxes and momentum spectrum could be well understood since the collider detectors, CMS and ATLAS, at LHC can be used for monitoring production rates of major neutrino sources, Pions, Kaons, heavy mesons and etc..",

            "text": "Since main sources of neutrinos from pp collisions at the LHC are Pions, Kaons, charm and beauty particles, the yields and transverse and longitudinal momentum spectra of those particles should be well understood for the estimation of neutrino fluxes. We use the PYTHIA program with the tuned parameter set, which is widely used and intensively tested with real data for the LHC experiments at \u221a s = 7 TeV. Although the yields for Kaons and beauty mesons are not well agreed with the PYTHIA [9,10,11], the shape for transverse momentum spectra of those particles are generally good. Recent measurement for \u03c3(pp \u2192 bbX) at \u221a s = 7 TeV is found to be (284 \u00b1 20 \u00b1 49) \u00b5b [13], and PYTHIA estimation is 226.7 \u00b5b, which is about 20 % lower. This suggests that we may underestimate the neutrino flux by about 20 % level. In order to estimate neutrino fluxes from particle decays produced by pp collisions at \u221a s = 14 TeV of the LHC, we generate a large sample of events with the QCD 2 \u2192 2 processes, qq \u2192 qq, qq \u2192 qq, qq \u2192 gg, q + g \u2192 qg, gg \u2192 qq and gg \u2192 gg, in the PYTHIA. In addition, we update branching fractions for charm and beauty particles reported in the PDG book [12] in the PYTHIA program since those heavy particle decays are main sources for \u03bd \u03c4 , for example, the decay D + s \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03bd \u03c4 , and also for \u03bd e and \u03bd \u00b5 production at a few hundred meter away from the interaction point. The total cross-section for the QCD processes is found to be 54.7 mb. In particular, the cross sections for charm and beauty particles are 14.3 mb and 495.7 \u00b5b, respectively.",

Since it is difficult to estimate yields and directions for the particles after they are interacted with beam pipe and detector material, the transverse decay vertexes for neutrinos from the particle decays have to be less than 3 cm to ensure that the particles are decayed before hitting the beam pipe. Since two-separated proton rings at the LHC are merged to the common ring around the interaction point at the LHC, the longitudinal decay vertexes for neutrinos are required to be within 50 m from the interaction point to  guarantee particle decays inside the beam pipe.

            "text": "We estimate the neutrino fluxes from proton-proton collisions at \u221a s = 14 TeV with the designed luminosity, 10 34 cm \u22122 s \u22121 by using the PYTHIA program with the tuned parameter set. The estimated fluxes for \u03bd e , \u03bd \u00b5 and \u03bd \u03c4 including its anti-neutrino from mainly the decays of charm and beauty particles produced by pp collisions at the LHC are 2.93 \u00d7 10 12 , 7.26 \u00d7 10 12 and 7.1 \u00d7 10 10 , respectively. For a 203.3 ton detector subtending 3 mrad at 300 m away from the interaction point, the number of charged current events for \u03bd e (\u03bd e ), \u03bd \u00b5 (\u03bd \u00b5 ) and \u03bd \u03c4 (\u03bd \u03c4 ) are found to be 31,666 (15,623), 72,898 (37,184) and 209 (103). Our estimated the number of charged current events for \u03bd \u03c4 is lower than one in Ref. [4] by about a factor of three. This is mainly due to that in our estimation, the production rate for D + s is about 0.81 mb while the authors in Ref. [4] use the production rate for D + s with 2 mb.",
