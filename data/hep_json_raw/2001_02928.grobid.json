The choice of active media allowed operation in a high multiplicity environment, the ability to reconstruct neutral pions up to very high transverse momenta and to reach excellent energy and spatial resolutions. In order to increase light yield of crystals and further improve the energy resolution, PHOS is cooled to a constant temperature of -25 \u2022 C. Dedicated L0 and L1 triggers allowed for an increased collected integrated luminosity in data taking. PHOS consists of 3 + 1/2 modules with total of 12544 channels. A Charged Particle Veto (CPV) detector is designed to reject charged particles from the cluster spectrum. First module of CPV was installed to the detector during the Long Shutdown 1 (LS1) between Run 1 and Run 2. Two more modules are being installed and comissioned during current the Long Shutdown 2 (LS2) for future Run 3 (2021-2025).",

For relative gain calibration in PHOS, pre-calibration based on APD gain equalization and fine energy calibration based on \u03c0 0 peak position were used. Absolute energy scale was checked with electrons E/p in PHOS, and with electron beam tests in case of EMCal.",

PHOS and EMCAL are able to reconstruct neutral mesons in low and high multiplicity environments in a wide p T ranges. Typical two-photon invariant mass distributions are shown in Figure 4. In pp collisions, excellent resolution of PHOS results in \u03c0 0 -peak width as low as \u03c3 \u03c0 0 m = 4.56 \u00b1 0.03 MeV/c 2 [9]. Electrons are identified with high purity in calorimeters by E/p  ratio in conjunction with tracking system via dE/dx. Due to wide acceptance and trigger on highenergy electrons, EMCal contributes to electron measurements at high p T with high integrated luminosity. PHOS has also the capability to identify electrons. E/p distributions for both PHOS and EMCal are shown in Figure 5. ALICE results on heavy flavour, i.e. recent measurements of electrons from heavy-flavour hadron decays in p-Pb collisions at \u221a s N N = 5.02 TeV [14], heavily rely on EMCal triggering and identification of electrons. One of the goals of EMCal is to trigger on jets and to measure neutral energy of jets.

In case of PHOS, R&D studies are ongoing to upgrade its FEE and photodetectors. Test beam studies [18] showed that the most promising solution will be upgrade from APD of 5 \u00d7 5 mm 2 size to APD of 10 \u00d7 10 mm 2 size which will allow to keep current energy resolution parameters without need to cool down the whole detector to -25 \u2022 C. The main advantage of this is a possibility to access the FEE for maintenance during short periods between data taking.",

The latter is important for prolongation of the lifespan of the whole detector system. Improvement of time resolution opens possibilities to study direct photons with higher precision. Currently, the prototype of new front-end card is being developed with timing channel on the base of CERN's HPTDC chip [19]. It was tested at CERN during 2017-2018, and energy and time resolutions were measured. Time resolution of about 300 ps was achieved with Hamamatsu multi-pixel photon counter S12572 and about 500 ps with Hamamatu APD S8664-1010 of size 10 \u00d7 10 mm 2 [18].",
