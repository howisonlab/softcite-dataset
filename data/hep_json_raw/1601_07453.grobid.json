Each top squark is assumed to decay to a b-and an s-quark, leading to four quarks in the final state. Background discrimination is achieved with the use of b-tagging and selections on the mass and substructure of large-radius jets, providing sensitivity to top squark masses as low as 100 GeV. No evidence of an excess beyond the Standard Model background prediction is observed and top squarks decaying tobs are excluded for top squark masses in the range 100 \u2264 mt \u2264 315 GeV at 95% confidence level.",

            "text": "1 Introduction Supersymmetry (SUSY) is an extension of the Standard Model (SM) [1][2][3][4][5][6][7] that fundamentally relates fermions and bosons. It is an especially alluring theoretical possibility given its potential to solve the hierarchy problem [8][9][10][11] and to provide a dark-matter candidate [12,13]. This paper presents a search for the pair production of supersymmetric top squarks (stops), 1 which then each decay to two SM quarks, using 17.4 fb \u22121 of \u221a s = 8 TeV protonproton (pp) collision data recorded by the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). This decay violates the R-parity conservation (RPC) [14] assumed by most searches for stops [15,16]. In RPC scenarios, SUSY particles are required to be produced in pairs and decay to the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP), which is stable. In R-parity-violating JHEP06(2016)067 The reduced sensitivity of standard SUSY searches to RPV scenarios is primarily due to the limited effectiveness of the high missing transverse momentum requirements used in the event selection common to many of those searches, motivated by the assumed presence of undetected LSPs. Consequently, the primary challenge in searches for RPV SUSY final states is to identify suitable substitutes for background rejection to the canonical large missing transverse momentum signature.",

For mt \u2248 100-300 GeV, the initial stop transverse momentum (p T ) spectrum extends significantly into the range for which p T mt. This feature is the result of boosts received from initial-state radiation (ISR) as well as originating from the parton distribution functions (PDFs). As the Lorentz boost of each stop becomes large, the stop decay products begin to merge with a radius roughly given by \u2206R \u2248 2mt/p T , and thus can be clustered together within a single largeradius (large-R) jet with a mass m jet \u2248 mt. By focusing on such cases, the dijet and multijet background can be significantly reduced via selections that exploit this kinematic relationship and the structure of the resulting stop jet, in a similar way to boosted objects used in previous measurements and searches by ATLAS [45][46][47][48][49]. In this case, since the stop is directly produced in pairs instead of from the decay of a massive parent particle, the strategy is most effective at low mt where the boosts are the largest.",

All non-SM particles masses are set to 5 TeV except for the stop mass, which is scanned in 25 GeV steps from mt = 100 GeV to mt = 400 GeV.  The signal cross-section used (shown in figure 2) is calculated to next-to-leading order in the strong coupling constant, adding the resummation of soft gluon emission at next-toleading-logarithmic accuracy (NLO+NLL) [63][64][65]. For the range of stop masses considered, the uncertainty on the cross-section is approximately 15% [66]. MadGraph 5.1.4.8 [67] is used to study the impact of ISR on the stop p T spectrum. The MadGraph samples have one additional parton in the matrix element, which improves the modelling of a hard ISR jet. MadGraph is then interfaced to PYTHIA 6.426 with the AUET2B tune [68] and the CTEQ6L1 PDF set for parton shower and hadronisation. The distribution of p T (tt * ) from the nominal Herwig++ signal sample is then reweighted to match that of the MadGraph+PYTHIA sample.",

To reject non-collision beam backgrounds and cosmic rays, events are required to contain a primary vertex consistent with the LHC beamspot, reconstructed from at least two tracks with transverse momenta p track T > 400 MeV. If more than one vertex satisfies these criteria, the primary vertex is chosen as the one with the highest tracks (p 2 T ). The anti-k t algorithm [80], with a radius parameter of R = 0.4, is used for initial jet-finding using version 3 of FastJet [81]. The inputs to the jet reconstruction are threedimensional topo-clusters [82]. This method first clusters together topologically connected calorimeter cells and classifies these clusters as either electromagnetic or hadronic. The classification uses a local cluster weighting calibration scheme based on cell-energy density and shower depth within the calorimeter [83]. Based on this classification, energy corrections are applied which are derived from single-pion MC simulations. Dedicated hadronic corrections are derived to account for the effects of differences in response to hadrons compared to electrons, signal losses due to noise-suppression threshold effects, and energy lost in non-instrumented regions. The final jet energy calibration is derived from MC simulation as a correction relating the calorimeter response to the jet energy at generator level. In order to determine these corrections, the same jet definition used in the reconstruction is applied to stable (with lifetimes greater than 10 ps) generator-level particles, excluding muons and neutrinos. A subtraction procedure is also applied in order to mitigate the effects of pileup [84]. Finally, the R = 0.4 jets are further calibrated with additional correction factors derived in situ from a combination of \u03b3+jet, Z+jet, and dijet-balance methods [83].",

A working point corresponding to a 70% b-jet efficiency in simulated tt events is used. The corresponding mis-tag rates, defined as the fraction of jets originating from non-b-jets which are tagged by the b-tagging algorithm in an inclusive jet sample, for light jets and c-jets are approximately 1% and 20%, respectively.

The search is done in regions of m jet avg that are optimised to give the best significance. As shown in figure 4, the stop signal is expected as a peak that would appear on top of a smoothly falling background spectrum. A Gaussian distribution is fitted to the stop signal m jet avg peak. The mean of the fit, m jet avg , is consistent with mt in each case. The resolution of the m jet avg peak is given approximately by s/ m jet avg \u223c 5 \u2212 7% (where s is the standard deviation of the fit), and has only a weak dependence on the stop mass in the range probed by this analysis.

Figure 5 shows the product of acceptance and efficiency, after the SR cuts and mass windows, as a function of mt. The significantly lower acceptance times efficiency for light stop masses in figure 5 is almost entirely due to the efficiency of the trigger selections which are for 100, 250, and 400 GeV stop masses 0.56%, 22%, and 96%, respectively.
