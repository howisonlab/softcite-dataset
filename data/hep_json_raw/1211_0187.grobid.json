The study of strange hadrons and resonances helps us to understand the properties of the medium created in the heavyion collisions and its evolution. We present the yields (dN/dy) at mid-rapidity for strange hadrons (\u039b, \u039e \u2212 , \u2126 \u2212 , their anti-particles and K 0 S ) and resonances (\u03c6 and K * 0 ) for several collision centrality intervals. The results from Pb-Pb collisions at \u221a s NN = 2.76 TeV are presented and compared to corresponding results from pp collisions and lower energy measurements. Baryon to meson ratios and resonance to non-resonance particle ratios relative to pp collisions are shown as a function of collision centrality and compared with the results at lower energies.",

            "text": "The study of strange hadrons and resonances can provide information about the hot and dense strongly interacting matter created in high energy heavy-ion collisions. The colliding nuclei do not contain strange valence quarks. All the particles with non-zero strangeness quantum number are created in the course of the collision. The enhancement of strangeness in high energy heavy ion collisions relative to pp collisions is one of the signatures of quark gluon plasma formation [1]. The measurement of resonance properties is also important because of their short lifetime (a few fm/c) and interactions with the medium. The hadronic decay products of the resonances can get rescattered in the hadronic medium causing a loss in the reconstructed resonance signal. Further a resonance may be generated due to the scattering among the hadrons in the medium. These two competing processes (rescattering and regeneration) play an important role in deciding the final resonance yields and hence the resonance to non-resonance particle ratios [2].",

The components of the ALICE detector used for the measurement of particle momenta and to reconstruct the primary vertex position are the Inner Tracking System (ITS) and the Time Projection Chamber (TPC). The particle identification is done using the specific ionization energy loss inside the TPC. A pair of scintillation hodoscopes, the VZERO detectors ( 2.8 < \u03b7 < 5.1 and -3.7 < \u03b7 < -1.7), were used for event triggering and centrality estimation. The strange hadrons and resonances are studied in a sample of approximately 10 million minimum bias \u221a s NN = 2.76 TeV Pb-Pb events, collected during the year 2010.",

In order to extract the particle yields of strange hadrons and resonances, the spectra are fitted using a Blast-Wave parameterization [5] (Tsallis-Levy parameterization [6] is used for K * 0 ) 1 . The yields are calculated integrating the corrected spectra in the measured p T region and extrapolating using the fit outside this region. To evaluate the systematic uncertainty in the extrapolation region, exponential and Tsallis-Levy functions were used. Figure 1 shows the particle yield ratios \u03c6/K \u2212 , K * 0 /K \u2212 and \u039b/\u03c0 as a function of mean number of participating nucleons ( N part ) in Pb-Pb collisions at \u221a s NN = 2.76 TeV. A weak centrality dependence is observed in the K * 0 /K \u2212 ratio, while the \u03c6/K \u2212 ratio is independent of collision centrality. The decreasing trend in K * 0 /K \u2212 ratio suggests (considering the factor of 10 difference in lifetime of \u03c6 and K * 0 ) a possible increase in rescattering in the most central collisions. A naive expectation from a kaon coalescence model [8] is an increase in \u03c6/K ratio with increasing collision centrality, which is not seen in our data. The \u039b/\u03c0 ratio is found to be independent of collision centrality. We have also studied the beam energy dependence of particle yield ratios in Figure 2. The results are compared with lower energy measurements at SPS [9] and RHIC [10] and also with the pp measurements [11]. The particle ratios \u03c6/K, \u03c6/\u03c0, K * 0 /K \u2212 and \u039e/\u03c0 are found to be independent of beam energy. The K * 0 /K \u2212 ratio in Pb-Pb collisions is less than that measured in pp collisions. This observation may also indicate the effect of hadronic rescattering at LHC energies. The strangeness enhancement has been calculated as the yield per participant in Pb-Pb collisions relative to the yield per participant in pp collisions. Figure 3 shows the enhancement of \u039e \u2212 , \u2126 \u2212 as a function of N part . These results are compared with the measurements at SPS [13] and at RHIC [14]. We observe that the enhancement in \u2126 \u2212 is larger than that of \u039e \u2212 , following the hierarchy based on the strangeness content of the particle. The enhancement decreases with the increase in the beam energy following the trend already observed between SPS and RHIC.",
