By measuring variations of a paramagnetic GSO crystal magnetization with a dc-SQUID magnetometer we investigate the possible coupling between electron spins and unpolarized nucleons in lead disks. The induced magnetization can be interpreted as the effect of a long-range spin dependent interaction mediated by axions or Axion Like Particles (ALPs). The corresponding coupling strength is proportional to the CP violating term g e p g N s , i.e. the product of the pseudoscalar and scalar coupling constants of electron and nucleon, respectively. Our upper limit is more constraining than previous ones in the interaction range 0.01 m < \u03bb a < 0.2 m, with a best result on g e p g N s /( c)",

            "text": "The signature of symmetry breaking at extremely high energies can be highlighted by the presence of long-range ultraweak forces mediated by pseudo-Goldstone bosons [1]. In particular, the pseudo-boson can be either the QCD axion or an axion-like-particle (ALP), which involves P and T violating forces with strength proportional to the product of the couplings at the pseudo-boson vertices [2]. There are two options for coupling pseudo-scalar bosons with fundamental fermions: i) the spin-dependent pseudoscalar vertex, and ii) the scalar vertex that becomes spin-independent in the non relativistic limit. Thus, in a multipole expansion, the two fields are described by the \"dipole\" (pseudo-scalar coupling g p ) and \"monopole\" (scalar coupling g s ) moments, respectively. For instance, exchange of virtual axions -a possible solution of the strong CP problem -mediates a monopole-dipole force where g s is proportional to the QCD vacuum angle \u03d1 10 \u221210 \u00f7 10 \u221214 . In Fig.(1) we report the Feynman diagram of the g p g s interaction between an electron e \u2212 and a nucleus N mediated by an axion or ALPs that we investigate in this paper. The monopole-dipole coupling of the spin of a polarized electron with an unpolarized nucleus mediated by axions is described by the potential [2] V md (r) =",

As shown in Fig.(3), the superconducting input coil of the SQUID L i 1.8 \u00b5H is connected to a superconducting pick-up coil L p , which is wound around the GSO crystal. To satisfy the optimal matching condition L p = L i of the SQUID, the pick-up coil is made of 8 turns of a NbTi wire. The two coils L i and L p are connected in series forming a superconducting transformer which transfers the magnetic flux from the pick-up coil to the SQUID loop. As B eff is not a true magnetic field, we can reduce the environmental magnetic disturbances around the GSO with magnetic shields. In particular, we make use of two concentric Bi-2223 cylindrical superconducting shields at liquid helium temperature, and a \u00b5-metal external shield at room temperature to reduce the field trapped in the inner shields.",

To estimate this phase, we drilled 64 holes of millimeter size evenly spaced on the circumference of the wheel. A passing-through laser illuminates a hole and a photodiode measures the intensity of the passing-through light. From the acquired intensity, we were able to estimate the rotation frequency f w of the wheel and the phase of the sources. The SQUID output signal and the phase of the sources were acquired simultaneously with a high definition oscilloscope. Then we performed a phase sensitive detection using a digital lock-in that provides amplitude and phase of the output with respect to the signal frequency given by f s = 4f w = 10 Hz. The presence of a signal due to changes of GSO magnetization in phase with the reference can be detected looking at the statistical distribution of the lock-in output amplitudes, see Fig.(4b). In Fig.(5) we report the Allan standard deviation of the in-phase lock-in output with reference frequency f s . The long term stability of our apparatus allows us to integrate the lock-in output for 1.5 \u00d7 10 4 s estimating the corresponding mean B eff = 1.8 \u00d7 10 \u221217 T and standard deviation \u03c3 B eff = 2.9 \u00d7 10 \u221217 T, expressed in equivalent magnetic field at the pickup coil. The mean value is compatible with zero within one standard deviation, and so we conclude that we have observed no induced magnetization in the GSO crystal due to monopole-dipole interaction mediated by axions or ALPs.",

            "text": "Using numerical integration of Eq.(4) over the volume of the sources and taking into account the geometry of the apparatus, we can convert our measurements of the effective magnetic field in a upper limit on g e p g N s . Since the modulation and intensity of the signal both depend on \u03bb a , a correction curve g(\u03bb a ) was estimated to obtain the actual measured limit. Using this procedure we get our best upper limit on the coupling g e p g N s /( c) \u2264 4.3 \u00d7 10 \u221230 at 95% C.L. in the range 1 cm < \u03bb a < 20 cm. Above the upper end of this range, the effective magnetic field no longer depends on \u03bb a and so the sensitivity of our experiment to axion or ALP mediators decreases. At the lower end the sensitivity is limited by the exponential decay e \u2212r/\u03bba of the monopole dipole interaction.  [7,18,10,8,11,19] in terms of the strength of the monopoledipole interaction. It is worth noticing that the g e p g N s coupling can be also strongly constrained by star cooling processes [20].",
