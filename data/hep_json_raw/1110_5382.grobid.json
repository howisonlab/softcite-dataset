T2K is long baseline neutrino experiment in Japan with detectors located at J-PARC, Tokai, and at Kamioka in the Gifu Prefecture, situated 295 km away from J-PARC. The muon neutrino beam is produced and measured at the near detectors at J-PARC whilst the neutrino rates after oscillation are measured with the Super-Kamiokande detector, at Kamioka. A total of six events pass all the selection criteria for \u03bd\u00b5\u2192\u03bde oscillations at the far detector Super-Kamiokande, leading to 0.03(0.04) < sin 2 2\u03b813 < 0.28(0.34) for \u03b4CP = 0 and normal (inverted) hierarchy at 90% C.L. The \u03bd\u00b5 disappearance analysis excludes no oscillations at 4.3\u03c3. At 90% C.L., the best fit values are sin 2 2\u03b823 > 0.84 and 2.1 \u00d7 10 \u22123 < \u2206m 2 23 (eV 2 ) < 3.1 \u00d7 10 \u22123 . Finally, we present an overview of the T2K plans from 2011 onwards.",

Here we provide a brief review of the main components. The T2K muon neutrino beam is produced at J-PARC 2 and detected with Super-Kamiokande, the far detector, located in Kamioka in the Gifu Prefecture 295 km away from J-PARC. T2K adopts the off-axis method [3] to generate a narrow-band neutrino beam using the new MW-class proton synchrotron at J-PARC. The neutrino beam is thus directed at an angle of 2.5 \u2022 with respect to the baseline connecting the proton target and Super-Kamiokande, corresponding to a peak energy of about 0.6 GeV, which maximizes the effect of the neutrino oscillation at 295 km and minimizes the background to electron-neutrino appearance detection. The angle can be reduced down to 2.0 \u2022 , allowing variation of the peak neutrino energy, if necessary.",

            "text": "The near detector site at about 280 m from the production target houses on-axis and off-axis detectors with respect to the direction of the neutrino beam. The on-axis detector INGRID (Interactive Neutrino GRID) [4] is composed of an array of iron/scintillator sandwiches and its main goal is to measure the neutrino beam direction and profile. INGRID can measure the beam centre with a precision better than 28 cm corresponding to 1 mrad or a shift of around 2% in the peak of the neutrino energy spectrum. The off-axis detector (ND280), see Ref. [5] of this conference proceedings, is a multipurpose magnetised detector which measures the muon neutrino flux and energy spectrum and intrinsic electron neutrino contamination in the direction of Super-Kamiokande. It also measures the rates for exclusive neutrino reactions, relevant to the disappearance and appearance searches at Super-Kamiokande. These measurements are essential in order to characterize signals and backgrounds that are observed in the Super-Kamiokande far-detector. The off-axis detector measures both charged and neutral particles. It consists of a water-scintillator detector optimized to identify the \u03c0 0 's (the P\u00d8D); a tracker system consisting of time projection chambers (TPCs) [6] and fine grained detectors (FGDs) optimized to study charged current interactions; and finally an electromagnetic calorimeter (ECal) that surrounds the P\u00d8D and the tracker. The whole off-axis detector is placed in a 0.2 T magnetic field provided by the recycled UA1 magnet, which also serves as part of a side muon range detector (SMRD).",

The data have 88 such FCFV events that are within the timing range from \u22122 to 10 \u00b5s around the beam trigger time. The accidental contamination from non-beam related events is determined from the sidebands to be 0.003 events. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test of the observed number of FCFV events as a function of accumulated p.o.t. is compatible with the normalized event rate being constant (p-value = 0.32). Forty-one events are reconstructed with a single ring, and eight of those are e-like. Six of these events have E vis > 100 MeV and no delayed-electron signal. To suppress misidentified \u03c0 0 mesons, the reconstruction of two rings is forced by comparison of the observed and expected light patterns calculated under the assumption of two showers, and a cut on the two-ring invariant mass M inv < 105 MeV/c 2 is imposed. No events are rejected (Fig. 2). Finally, the neutrino energy E rec \u03bd is computed using the reconstructed momentum and direction of the ring, by assuming quasi-elastic kinematics and neglecting Fermi motion.

A KS test on the R 2 distribution of our final events yields a p-value of 0.03.

Including systematic uncertainties the expectation is 1.5\u00b10.3(5.5\u00b11.0) events for sin 2 2\u03b8 13 = 0(0.1). The probability to observe six or more candidate events is 7\u00d710 \u22123 for sin 2 2\u03b8 13 = 0. Thus, we conclude that our Table 3. Contributions from various sources and the total relative uncertainty for sin 2 2\u03b8 13 = 0 and 0.1, and \u03b4 CP = 0. data indicate \u03bd e appearance from a \u03bd \u00b5 neutrino beam. At each oscillation parameter point, a probability distribution for the expected number of events is constructed, incorporating systematic errors [13], which is used to make the confidence interval ( Fig. 4), following the unified ordering prescription of Feldman and Cousins [14].  This result converted into a confidence interval yields 0.03(0.04) < sin 2 2\u03b8 13 < 0.28(0.34) at 90% C.L. for sin 2 2\u03b8 23 = 1.0, |\u2206 2 m 2 23 | = 2.4\u00d710 \u22123 eV 2 , \u03b4 CP = 0 and for normal (inverted) neutrino mass hierarchy. Under the same assumptions, the best fit points are 0.11(0.14), respectively. For non-maximal sin 2 2\u03b8 23 , the confidence intervals remain unchanged to first order by replacing sin 2 2\u03b8 13 by 2 sin 2 \u03b8 23 sin 2 2\u03b8 13 . More data are required to firmly establish \u03bd e appearance and to better determine the angle \u03b8 13 . These results have been published in Ref.

No serious damages were found in the accelerator complex, the neutrino beamline or the near detectors. The Super-Kamiokande detector was not affected by the earthquake. We are on schedule to resume operations at J-PARC in December 2011 with the T2K experiment expected to start data taking as soon as possible early 2012. The current goal is to collect 1 \u00d7 10 21 p.o.t. by summer 2013. Such a data sample will allow the confirmation of a non-zero value of \u03b8 13 with 5 sigma statistical significance at the present best fit value.",

We published our first results on the \u03bd e appearance analysis [2] where we report the observation of six single ring e-like events. The probability to observe six or more events is 7\u00d710 \u22123 for sin 2 2\u03b8 13 = 0. This result yields 0.03(0.04) < sin 2 2\u03b8 13 < 0.28(0.34) at 90% C.L. for sin 2 2\u03b8 23 = 1.0, |\u2206m 2 23 | = 2.4\u00d710 \u22123 eV 2 , \u03b4 CP = 0 and for normal (inverted) neutrino mass hierarchy. Under the same assumptions, the best fit points are 0.11(0.14), respectively. These results are consistent with the results published subsequently by MINOS.",
