The search method is based on a missing mass spectrum in the reaction e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b3A . It allows observation of the A signal independently of its decay modes and life time. The projected result of this experiment corresponds to an upper limit on the square of the coupling constant \u03b5 2 = 3 \u2022 10 \u22128 with a signal-to-noise ratio of two to one at an A mass of 5-20 MeV.",

Most of the search activity is focused on possible heavy particles with a mass scale of 1 TeV and above. At the same time, as was suggested by P. Fayet [2,3], there could be extra U(1) symmetry, which requires a new gauge boson, U, also called the A -boson. The boson could be light and weakly interacting with known particles through kinetic mixing with the ordinary photon [4]. Most constraints for the light A -boson parameters were obtained from electron and muon anomalous magnetic moments (g \u2212 2) and particle decay modes [5][6][7][8].",

            "text": "Several methods have been used in the search for the A -boson signal, considering \"invisible\" decay modes of the A -boson. The first method uses precise experimental data on exotic decay modes of elementary particles, e.g. \u03c0 \u2022 \u2192 invisible + \u03b3, for the calculation of the upper limit on the A -boson coupling constant \u03b5 to the specific flavour. These upper limits for decay of the J/\u03a8 and \u03a5 to a photon plus invisible particles were obtained experimentally by means of the \"missing particle\" approach, where a missing particle in the event type e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b3X leads to a yield of events with a large energy photon detected at a large angle with respect to the direction of the positron and electron beams. From the yield of such events the coupling constant could be determined for a wide range of mass of the hypothetical A -boson. A recent experiment [15] using 53 fb \u22121 of e + e \u2212 collision data collected with CM energies near the \u03a5(2S), \u03a5(3S) and \u03a5(4S) resonances provided the best data for \u03a5 decay to A + \u03b3 and a limit on the coupling of the A -boson to the b-quark. In the mass region below 100 MeV the obtained limit for B(\u03a5(2S, 3S, 4S) \u2192 \u03b3A ) \u00d7 B(A \u2192 invisible) is 1 \u2022 10 \u22126 ; an additional hypothesis of coupling constants' universality is required to get a bound on \u03b5, so direct measurement of the coupling to an electron is of large interest. Currently, the upper limit on the vector coupling obtained from the discrepancy between the calculated electron anomalous magnetic moment and the measured one is \u03b5 < 1.0 \u2022 10 \u22124 \u00d7 m A [MeV] [7,8].",

Such a method provides a very high sensitivity in a wide range of A -boson mass but there is a potential problem due to use of a veto approach which suppresses observation of a semi-invisible decay. Similar decay modes were considered recently in Ref. [17]. In the missing-energy method the parameters m A and \u03b5 can not be separately extracted. This limitation is overcome in the LDMX experiment [18], which performs tracking on the recoiling electron.",

The recently commissioned new VEPP-5 electron/positron injection complex is able to provide an injection rate of 2 \u00d7 10 9 positrons per second at an energy of E + \u2248 500 MeV. In addition, the injection complex includes a damping storage ring at the final stage. This allows the implementation of an effective 6-bunch injecting scheme in which the oldest bunch is replaced by a new one every 10 seconds. Each new bunch contains 2 \u00d7 10 10 e + , corresponding to a VEPP-3 beam current of 13 mA. For an internal hydrogen target having a thickness of 10 16 atoms/cm 2 , the beam lifetime in VEPP-3 is 60 seconds. With 6 sequentially refilled bunches this gives an average beam current of \u223c 50 mA and a luminosity of \u223c 3 \u00d7 10 33 cm \u22122 s \u22121 .  Usually the internal target is located in one of the two 12-meter-long straight sections of the VEPP-3 ring. In the same straight section there are also two RF cavities, four quadrupoles and one sextupole lens, and elements of beam injection and extraction channels. The space available for the internal target equipment is 217 cm long. In our earlier proposal [40] we described a possible configuration of the experiment based on a chicane magnet installed in this segment of VEPP-3. However, such a configuration has significant difficulties, both technical and organizational. The latter follows from the fact that when a chicane magnet is installed in the ring, VEPP-3 becomes completely inaccessible for other working regimes, including operation as a booster for VEPP-4 or as a synchrotron radiation source.",

Therefore, a rejection of bremsstrahlung events with an efficiency would result in an increase in the search sensitivity by a factor of 1/ \u221a 1 \u2212 . Since in this process the positron loses energy and is swept out by the D2 dipole magnet, such background events can be vetoed by detecting the scattered positron. For this purpose, compact sandwich or simple plastic counters will be installed downstream from the D2 magnet. The fraction of bremsstrahlung events detected by these counters depends on their geometry. The total rate of positrons emitting a photon with energy above the E \u03b3 = 25 MeV threshold can be estimated by integrating Eq. 3.3. For the luminosity of L = 10 33 cm \u22122 s \u22121 the rate is 30 MHz, see Fig. 4. Hence, the veto counter would be useless at this luminosity if it detects all positrons including those which emit photons outside the photon detector acceptance. Using the MC simulation we have chosen a configuration with a positron rate of f e + \u223c 2.5 MHz, which gives only 10% event loss due to accidental coincidences -see Fig. 8. The simulation has shown that the veto efficiency is a function of missing mass range and it is generally higher for the bremsstrahlung from a hydrogen target process than for the radiative Bhabha one, with an overall mean value of about 70%.",

That is why the acceptance of the proposed photon detector is chosen to provide the detection of both gamma quanta to improve the search sensitivity at low M A . Figure 15 shows the missing mass spectra obtained in the full Monte Carlo simulation. its mass for the case of its invisible decay to dark matter particles. The hatched areas are regions excluded by the results of the measurements of anomalous magnetic moments of electron and muon [8]. The green band indicates a \"welcome\" area, where the consistency of theoretical and experimental values of a \u00b5 would improve to 2\u03c3 or less [8]. The shaded areas are the excluded parameter spaces of the completed searches [15,16,45,46]. Curves show areas of search of the experiment at VEPP-3 and of other proposed experiments [47]. The search sensitivity of the VEPP-3 experiment is presented for two operation regimes: with and without use of the positron veto counter. The veto-OFF search is a factor of two less sensitive, but this is a truly decay-mode independent approach.",
