The p T spectrum of charged hadron associated with high-p T J/\u03c8 triggers on the away side is found to be consistent with that from di-hadron correlations.

            "text": "The dissociation of J/\u03c8 due to color-screening of their constituent quarks in a Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) is a classic signature for deconfinement in relativistic heavy-ion collisions [1]. Results from the PHENIX experiment at RHIC show that the suppression of J/\u03c8 as a function of centrality (the number of participants) is similar to that observed by NA50 and NA60 at the CERN-SPS, even though the temperature and energy density reached in these collisions is significantly lower than at RHIC [2]. This indicates that additional mechanisms, such as recombination of charm quarks in the later stage of the collision and/or suppression of feed-down contribution from charmonium excited states or B-hadrons, may play an important role; they will need to be studied systematically before conclusion from the observed suppression pattern can be drawn. Recently, the STAR experiment has extended J/\u03c8 suppression measurement to high p T in Cu+Cu collisions and found that the J/\u03c8 nuclear modification factor R AA is consistent with no J/\u03c8 suppression at p T > 5 GeV/c, in contrast to the prediction from a theoretical model of quarkonium dissociation in a strongly coupled liquid using an AdS/CFT approach [3,4]. The project is not yet complete and we need to increase the statistics, investigate the meachanism of J/\u03c8 formation, and perform the same measurement with a larger system (Au+Au). On the other hand, measurements from CDF shows that the contribution of B-hadrons relative to the inclusive J/\u03c8 yield in p +p collisions at 1.96 TeV significantly increases with increasing p T . The same measurement at RHIC energy will be also essentially needed to disentangle the physics origin of the high-p T J/\u03c8 suppression measurements [5].",

            "text": "In this analysis, the J/\u03c8 is reconstructed through its decay into electron-position pairs, J/\u03c8 \u2192 e + e \u2212 (Branching ratio (B) = 5.9%). The data sample used was triggered at level-0 by the STAR Barrel Electromagnetic Calorimeter (BEMC) by requiring the transverse energy deposited in any tower (\u2206\u03b7 \u00d7 \u2206\u03c6 = 0.05 \u00d7 0.05) above a given high-energy threshold to enrich high-p T electrons. This effectively enriches high-p T J/\u03c8 with limited data acquisition rate. The integrated luminosity is 1.8 pb \u22121 , 3.2 pb \u22121 and 23.1 pb \u22121 with transverse energy threshold 2.6 GeV < E T < 4.3 GeV, E T > 4.3 GeV and E T > 6.0 GeV respectively. The reconstruction method is similar as what we used in year 2005 and year 2006 data. We tightened the dE/dx cut slightly to enhance the signal-to-background (S/B) ratio for the correlation study [3,10]. In year 2009, STAR installed 72% TOF trays at mid-rapidity (|\u03b7| < 0.9). This detector combined with the Time Projection Chamber (TPC) can clearly identify electrons from low to high p T by rejecting hadrons at low and intermediate p T range. To further improve the S/B ratio of J/\u03c8, we also require the electron which does not trigger the BEMC to have 1/\u03b2 measured by TOF within 0.97-1.03 when its p T is less than 1 GeV/c [11]. Figure 1 shows the invariant mass distribution for unlike-sign (solid circles) and like-sign (shaded band) electron pairs. We reconstructed 376 J/\u03c8 with 3.0 < M < 3.2 GeV/c 2 at p T > 4 GeV/c. The S/B ratio in this range is 22. Such high S/B ratio is very suitable for the J/\u03c8-hadron correlation study. We do the correlation in 3 J/\u03c8 p T slices: 4 \u2212 6 GeV/c, 6\u22128 GeV/c and 8\u221212 GeV/c. Figure 2 shows the azimuthal angle correlations between high-p T J/\u03c8 of 8\u221212 GeV/c and charged hadrons. The correlated yield on the near-side is not as significant at that in the di-hadron correlation measurements [12]. The lines show the results of a PYTHIA calculation. The dot-dashed line exhibits a strong nearside correlation compared to the away-side dominantly from the decay B \u2192 J/\u03c8+ X. The solid line shows a \u03c7 2 fit with the two simulated components to extract the relative contribution of B-hadron feed-down to the inclusive J/\u03c8 yield. This ratio is 10%-25% in the measured p T range, shown in Fig. 3 in red solid circles, increases with increasing p T . The results are consistent with STAR's previous measurement (solid star symbol), but with better precision [3]. The same ratios measured by UA1 in p+p collisions at 630 GeV, by D0 (CDF) in p +p collisions at 1.8 (1.96) TeV and by CMS in p + p collisions at 7 TeV in various rapidity ranges are also shown for comparison [5,6,13,14]. They are consistent with each other even though the center-of-mass energies differ by an order of magnitude. The ATLAS and LHCb collaborations also observed a similar behavior [15,16]. The physics origin of this consistency is still unclear.",

Figure 4 shows the associated charged hadron p T distribution on the away side with respect to high-p T J/\u03c8 triggers and high-p T charged hadron triggers. The p T spectra of charged hadron associated with high-p T J/\u03c8 are consistent from different runs, but year 2009 results have a better precision. To compare the results with those from di-hadron correlation, we require J/\u03c8 triggers in year 2009 run within the same p T window as charged hadron triggers: 4 \u2212 6 GeV/c. The p T spectra of the associated charged hadrons with respect to both kinds of triggers are consistent with each other, which indicates that the hadrons on the away side of J/\u03c8 triggers are dominantly from light quark or gluon fragmentation, instead of heavy quark fragmentation. The consistency of J/\u03c8 R AA at midrapidity at RHIC and SPS top energies is still a puzzle. Two kinds of models with very different physics origins (recombination models and sequential dissociation models) can qualitatively explain this feature. The measurements of R AA in heavy-ion collisions at a center-of-mass energy between RHIC and SPS top energies are crucial to test these models. The RHIC Beam Energy Scan (BES) program enables such measurements (the reference data for R AA determination already exist). STAR has recorded hundreds of million Au+Au events at \u221a s NN = 39, 62 and 200 GeV respectively during year 2010 run. Figure 5 shows J/\u03c8 signal from partially produced 39 GeV Au+Au data to demonstrate STAR's J/\u03c8 capability at RHIC low energy run. The left panel of Fig. 5 shows the invariant mass distributions for electron pairs in BEMC triggered events. The electron identification and J/\u03c8 reconstruction is similar as what we used in year 2009 p+p data. The S/B ratio is lower than that in p+p collisions as expected, but still very high. To improve the statistics, we also reproduce the combinatorial background using mixed-event technique. It is consistent with that from like-sign technique in the mass range shown in the figure. We observed 82 \u00b1 13 (6 \u03c3) J/\u03c8 from this dataset, mainly at p T > 2 GeV/c. To study J/\u03c8 production at low p T , we also analyzed minimum-bias (MB) triggered data. In this analysis, we excluded BEMC from electron identification due to its inefficiency at low p T . The signal is shown in the right panel of Fig. 5. 91 \u00b1 22 (4 \u03c3) J/\u03c8 were observed from this 9% of full dataset, 52 in p T range 0-2 GeV/c and 39 in p T range 2-4 GeV/c. We expect \u223c 1000 (13 \u03c3) J/\u03c8 signal from the full MB dataset. Our projection shows STAR even has the capability to measure J/\u03c8 at 27 and 18 GeV with 1-2 weeks beam time in RHIC year 2011 run.",

The fraction of B-hadron feed-down contribution to inclusive J/\u03c8 yield in p+p collisions was extracted from the J/\u03c8-hadron correlation and found to be 10-25% in 4 < p T < 12 GeV/c, with no significant dependence on center-of-mass energy. The p T spectra of charged hadron associated with both high-p T J/\u03c8 triggers and high-p T charged hadron triggers on the away side were found to be consistent, which indicates the hadron production on the away side is not dominantly from heavy quark fragmentation. STAR observed 6 \u03c3 J/\u03c8 signal (mainly at p T > 2 GeV/c) in BEMC triggered 39 GeV Au+Au events, and 4 \u03c3 signal in 9% produced MB 39 GeV Au+Au events.",
