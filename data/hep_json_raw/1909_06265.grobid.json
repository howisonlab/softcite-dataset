The analyzed data set corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 77.4 fb \u22121 , collected using the CMS detector at the LHC in 2016 and 2017. Multivariate classifiers are used to discriminate between the signal and the dominant background processes. A maximum likelihood fit is performed to extract the signal cross section. This leads to the first evidence for WW production via double-parton scattering, with a significance of 3.9 standard deviations. The measured inclusive cross section is 1.41 \u00b1 0.28 (stat) \u00b1 0.28 (syst) pb.",

Although the factorized partonic cross sections remain unchanged, the PDF term in the DPS case contains elements from two distinct partons in each proton. This term includes a distance parameter between the partons in the plane transverse to the direction of motion of each proton. Precise calculations of the involved dynamics have been carried out for such a case [7]. Assuming that both the partonic cross sections and the transverse and longitudinal parts of the PDF terms factorize, the DPS cross section can be written in a simplified model as e-mail: cms-publication-committee-chair@cern.ch",

The factor n is equal to unity if processes A and B are the same, and is equal to two otherwise. The parameter \u03c3 eff , the effective cross section of DPS processes, is related to the extent of the parton distribution in the plane orthogonal to the direction of motion of the protons. It was measured at different hadron colliders and center-of-mass energies in a variety of final-state processes with comparatively large uncertainties (\u2248 30%). Its value ranges between 15 and 26 mb for processes involving a vector boson [13][14][15][16][17][18]21,23]. Significantly lower values, down to 2.2 mb, are measured for processes involving heavy-flavor production [22]. One of the most promising processes to study DPS is the case in which both hard scatterings lead to the production of a W boson, and, in particular, the final state with two samecharge W bosons [24]. The SHS W \u00b1 W \u00b1 production includes two additional partons and its cross section is therefore suppressed at the matrix-element level. Figure 1 illustrates the production of W \u00b1 W \u00b1 via the DPS process (left) and via SHS processes (middle and right) at leading order (LO) in perturbative quantum chromodynamics (QCD). The absence of jets in the W \u00b1 W \u00b1 production via DPS at LO in perturbation theory provides an additional handle to reduce the contributions from the SHS backgrounds by introducing an upper limit on the number of jets. Moreover, when both W bosons decay leptonically, this event exhibits a clean final state in the detector, and the excellent reconstruction and resolution of leptons in the CMS detector provides an accurate measurement of the WW DPS cross section.",

A measurement of the DPS WW production cross section (\u03c3 DPS WW ) would improve the reach of such searches. A search for the production of W \u00b1 W \u00b1 via DPS was reported in the past by the CMS Collaboration using pp collisions at \u221a s = 8 TeV, and an upper limit of 0.32 pb was set on its production cross section at 95% confidence level [19]. An increased production cross section at \u221a s = 13 TeV and a larger data set collected using the CMS detector allow a more detailed study of this rare and interesting physics process. This paper presents a measurement of this process performed with pp collision data, recorded using the CMS experiment at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV in 2016 and 2017.

The bore of the solenoid is outfitted with various particle detection systems. Charged-particle trajectories are measured in the silicon pixel and strip trackers, covering 0 < \u03c6 < 2\u03c0 in azimuth and |\u03b7| < 2.5, where the pseudorapidity \u03b7 is defined as \u03b7 = \u2212 ln[tan(\u03b8/2)], with \u03b8 being the polar angle of the trajectory of the particle with respect to the counterclockwise direction. A crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL), and a brass/scintillator hadron calorimeter surround the tracking volume. In this analysis, the calorimetry provides high resolution energy and direction measurements of electrons and hadronic jets. A preshower detector consisting of two planes of silicon sensors interleaved with lead is located in front of the ECAL at |\u03b7| > 1.479. Muons are measured in gas detectors embedded in the steel flux-return yoke outside the solenoid. The detector is nearly hermetic, allowing energy balance measurements in the plane transverse to the beam directions. A two-tier trigger system selects the most interesting pp collision events for use in physics analysis [29]. A more detailed description of the CMS detector can be found in Ref.",

They are based on neural networks and combine information on tracks and secondary vertices. The chosen working points correspond to a b tagging efficiency in the range of 80-90% and a mistagging rate around 10%. Reconstructed jets must not overlap with identified electrons, muons, or \u03c4 h within \u0394R = \u221a (\u0394\u03b7) 2 + (\u0394\u03c6) 2 < 0.4. To suppress jets originating from instrumental background or from additional pp interactions in the same and nearby bunch crossings (pileup), a jet quality requirement based on the energy fraction of neutral hadrons and charged hadrons associated with the primary vertex is applied [41]. The energy scale of jets is corrected for the nonlinear energy response of the calorimeters and the residual differences between the jet energy scale in the data and in the simulation, separately in the different data taking periods. The jet energy scale corrections are propagated to p miss T . Leptons are required to originate from the primary vertex of the event to mitigate pileup effects. An MVA classifier is used to distinguish between \"prompt\" electrons and muons coming from W, Z, or \u03c4 lepton decays and \"nonprompt\" leptons originating from heavy-quark decays or quark and gluon jets incorrectly reconstructed as leptons. This MVA classifier is trained using a set of observables related to the lepton kinematics, isolation, and identification, as well as variables relating the lepton to the nearest reconstructed PF jet, as described in Ref. [42]. The requirement of this lepton MVA classifier, referred to as the \"tight\" selection, corresponds to a selection efficiency for prompt leptons of about 90%, and has an efficiency for nonprompt leptons at the percent level. Further selection criteria are applied to ensure the correct assignment of the electric charge in the reconstruction. These selection criteria include requirements on the number of hits in the pixel system for electrons and on the agreement in the charge assignments of multiple reconstruction algorithms for muons.",

The scale factors for the WZ and ZZ processes are measured to be 1.01 \u00b1 0.16 and 0.97 \u00b1 0.06, respectively. The normalization uncertainties are estimated from the statistical uncertainty and purity of these control samples and their scale factors, and take values of 16 (6)% for the WZ (ZZ) process. A 50% normalization uncertainty is applied to all other simulated backgrounds, accounting for the theoretical uncertainties in the predicted cross sections and the lack of proper control samples in the data. The shape of the WZ process is allowed to vary between the shapes coming from the two event generators, powheg and MadGraph5_amc@nlo, and the corresponding uncertainty is considered correlated between 2016 and 2017. The shape agreement in the kinematic observables between the prediction and observation is of the order of 5% in the WZ and ZZ control regions. It is assumed that the shape agreement is similar in all remaining simulationderived backgrounds. Therefore a 5% shape uncertainty is applied to these components, which allows the shape of the final classifier to vary by up to 5% linearly and quadratically along the classifier distribution. The effect of variations in the renormalization and factorization scales is negligible for the most important background component, WZ, and is therefore neglected. Uncertainties in the PDF sets are expected to play a small role compared to the uncertainties described above. Both the relevant generator level distributions such as the rapidity of the W boson and the observable kinematic variables used in the analysis are consistent between NNPDF sets v3.0 and v3.1. An additional complication in the estimation of the uncertainty in the PDFs arises because the standard procedures for evaluating such uncertainties are illdefined in the case of the signal process. For instance, varying a PDF set by any number of replicas is an inadequate estimation of the modeling uncertainty that emerges because the two PDF terms of the separate hard scatters are factorized when simulating signal events. Therefore, such uncertainties are not considered. Rather, future measurements with larger data sets will allow the study of the production cross section differentially in observables that are sensitive to such nonfactorization effects.",

It is therefore essential to interpret any \"predicted\" number in the following, either from the factorization approach or from pythia, only as a rough estimate rather than a precisely derived quantity.

The analyzed data set corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 77.4 fb \u22121 , collected using the CMS detector in 2016 and 2017 at the LHC. The WW candidates are selected in same-charge electron-muon or dimuon events with moderate missing transverse momentum and low jet multiplicity. Multivariate classifiers based on boosted decision trees are used to discriminate between the signal and the dominant background processes. A maximum likelihood fit is performed to extract the signal cross section, which is compared to the predictions from simulation and from an approximate factorization approach. A measurement of the DPS WW cross section is achieved for the first time, and a cross section of 1.41\u00b10.28 (stat)\u00b10.28 (syst) pb is extracted with an observed significance of 3.9 standard deviations. This cross section leads to an effective cross section parameter of \u03c3 eff = 12.7 +5.0 \u22122.9 mb. The results in this paper constitute the first evidence for WW production from DPS.
