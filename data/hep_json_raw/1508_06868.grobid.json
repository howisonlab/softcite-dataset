The cross-section times branching ratio for events with at least two additional b-jets is measured to be 19.3 \u00b1 3.5 (stat.) \u00b1 5.7 (syst.) fb in the dilepton channel (e\u03bc, \u03bc\u03bc, and ee) using a method based on tight selection criteria, and 13.5 \u00b1 3.3 (stat.) \u00b1 3.6 (syst.) fb using a looser selection that allows the background normalisation to be extracted from data. The latter method also measures a value of 1.30 \u00b1 0.33 (stat.) \u00b1 0.28 (syst.)% for the ratio of tt production with two additional b-jets to tt production with any two additional jets.

            "text": "The measurement of top quark pair (tt) production in association with one or more jets containing b-hadrons (henceforth referred to as b-jets) is important in providing a detailed understanding of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). The most accurate theoretical predictions for these processes are fixed-order calculations at next-to-leading order (NLO) accuracy [1][2][3] in perturbative QCD (pQCD), which have been matched to a parton shower [4][5][6]. These calculations have significant uncertainties from missing higherorder terms [7,8], making direct experimental measurements of this process desirable. The measurement of such crosssections in fiducial phase-spaces, defined to correspond as closely as possible to the acceptance of the ATLAS detector, can be compared to theoretical predictions using the same fiducial requirements. This minimises theoretical extrapo-lations to phase-space regions that are not experimentally measurable.",

If a jet contains a b-hadron after this re-clustering, it is identified as a b-jet; similarly, if a jet contains no b-hadron but is ghost-matched to a c-hadron with p T > 5 GeV, it is identified as a c-jet.

The matrix-element calculation was performed using the CT10 PDF set and the parton shower used the AU2CT10 tune [45]. The sample is normalised to the NLO cross-section prediction and uses the SM values for the Higgs boson branching ratios [46]. W/Z+jets: Samples of W+jets and Z /\u03b3 * +jets were generated using the Alpgen v2.14 [47] leading-order (LO) generator and the CTEQ6L1 PDF set [48]. Parton shower and fragmentation were modelled with Pythia 6.426 [29]. To avoid double-counting of partonic configurations generated by both the matrix-element calculation and the parton-shower evolution, a parton-jet matching scheme (\"MLM matching\") [49] was employed. The W / Z+jets samples were generated with up to five additional partons, separately for production in association with b-quarks, c-quarks and light quarks. The overlap between events with heavy-flavour quarks obtained from the matrix element and the parton showers was removed using a scheme based on angular separation between the heavy quarks. The W / Z+jets backgrounds are normalised to the inclusive NNLO theoretical cross-section [50]. In the dilepton channel, a data-driven method is used to validate the Z+jets normalisation. A region enriched in Z+jets events is defined by inverting the requirement |m ee/\u03bc\u03bc \u2212 91 GeV| > 10 GeV. The data are found to agree with the prediction in all lepton channels.",

All samples were interfaced to Pythia 6.426 [29] with the CTEQ6L1 set of parton distribution functions and the Perugia2011C tune. In the dilepton channels, only the Wt process is considered. Overlaps between the tt and Wt final states were removed according to the inclusive Diagram Removal scheme [59]. The single-top-quark samples are normalised to the approximate NNLO theoretical cross-sections [60][61][62] using the MSTW2008 NNLO PDF set. All event generators using Herwig 6.520 [51] were also interfaced to Jimmy v4.31 [63] to simulate the underlying event. The samples that used Herwig or Pythia for showering and hadronisation were interfaced to Photos [64] for modelling of the QED final-state radiation and Tauola [65] for modelling the decays of \u03c4 leptons. The tt H sample was interfaced to Photos++. All samples were simulated taking into account the effects of multiple pp interactions based on the pile-up conditions in the 2012 data. The pileup interactions are modelled by overlaying simulated hits from events with exactly one inelastic (signal) collision per bunch crossing with hits from minimum-bias events that are produced with Pythia 8.160 using the A2M tune [45] and the MSTW2008 LO PDF [66]. Finally the samples were processed through a simulation [67] of the detector geometry and response using Geant4 [68]. All simulated samples were processed through the same reconstruction software as the data. Simulated events are corrected so that the object identification efficiencies, energy scales and energy resolu-  tions match those determined in data control samples. The alternative tt samples described in Sect. 6.3, used for evaluating systematic uncertainties, were instead processed with the ATLFAST-II [67] simulation. This employs a parameterisation of the response of the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters, and Geant4 for the other detector components. The nominal tt sample is processed with both Geant4 and ATLFAST-II; the latter is used when calculating the generator uncertainties. Table 3 provides a summary of basic settings of the MC samples used in the analysis. The alternative tt samples used to evaluate the tt generator uncertainties are described in Sect. 6.3.",

The renormalisation and factorisation scales were set to \u03bc = 1 2 H T , with the sum in this case running over all final-state particles in the underlying Born configuration. In contrast to MadGraph5_aMC@NLO, this sample employed the 5flavour scheme (5FS), which unlike the 4FS treats b-quarks as being massless and contains a resummation of logarithmically enhanced terms from collinear g \u2192 bb splittings [71]. In order to regularise the divergence associated with gluon splitting into a pair of massless bb quarks, the transverse momentum of each b-quark, and the invariant mass of the bb pair, were all required to be greater than 2 GeV. This implies that the 5FS calculation does not cover the entire phase-space measured by the ttb analyses. However, the missing events, in which a second b-quark is produced with p T below 2 GeV, or two b-quarks have invariant mass below 2 GeV, are expected to contribute only a small amount to the fiducial cross-section. The prediction for the ttbb fiducial crosssection is unaffected by the generator cuts.

The PowhegBox sample is the same one used for the nominal tt prediction, described in Sect. 4.2. A merged sample containing a tt final state with up to three additional partons (b, c, or light) was generated with MadGraph5 interfaced to Pythia 6.427 with the Perugia2011C [31] tune. Finally, in order to assess the effect of the different descriptions of the g \u2192 bb splitting in the parton shower, a sample consisting of LO tt matrix elements was generated with Pythia 8.205 [72] using the ATTBAR tune [74]. The inclusive cross-section of the sample was normalised to the NNLO + NNLL result [32][33][34][35][36][37]. Pythia 8 offers several options for modelling g \u2192 bb splittings in the final-state parton showers, which may be accessed by varying the Timeshower:weightGluonToQuark (wgtq) parameter [75]. Differences between the models arise by neglecting (wgtq5) or retaining (wgtq3, wgtq6) the massdependent terms in the g \u2192 bb splitting kernels. Differences also arise with respect to the treatment of the highm bb region, with specific models giving an enhanced or suppressed g \u2192 bb rate. The model corresponding to wgtq3 was chosen to maximise this rate. Finally, some of the models (wgtq5, wgtq6) offer the possibility to choose sgtq\u2022m bb instead of the transverse momentum as the argument of \u03b1 S in the g \u2192 bb vertices. Here sgtq refers to the TimeShower:scaleGluonToQuark parameter, and is allowed to vary in the range 0.25 \u2264 sgtq \u2264 1, with larger values giving a smaller g \u2192 bb rate and vice versa. For the model wgtq5, sgtq was set to 1, a combination that minimises the g \u2192 bb rate, while for wgtq6, sgtq was set to 0.25.",

These scale factors and their uncertainties are applied to each jet depending on its flavour and p T . In the case of light-flavour jets, the corrections also depend on jet \u03b7. The scale factors for \u03c4 jets are set to those for c jets and an additional extrapolation uncertainty is considered. For the fit-based analyses, the effect on the shape of the MV1c templates is considered. A covariance matrix is formed describing how each source of uncertainty in the scale factor measurement affects each p T bin. This matrix is diagonalised, leading to a set of statistically independent eigenvectors for each jet. The result is 24 uncorrelated uncertainties affecting the b-jet efficiency, 16 uncorrelated sources each for the c-jets and \u03c4 -jets, and 48 uncorrelated sources affecting the light jets. The effect of these uncertainties depends on the analysis and the sample in question. The b-tagging uncertainties are typically largest for the ttbb channels, having an effect of up to 10 %. The uncertainty on the measurement from varying the c-jet and light jet mis-tagging rates is usually less than 1 %, but may be larger for individual back-grounds.

The difference between the default and the modified \u03bc ttb , \u03bc ttb , represents the effect on \u03bc ttb of this particular uncertainty. The dominant uncertainties on both of these measurements are from tt modelling and b-tagging uncertainties affecting the c-jets. In the lepton-plus-jets analysis, due to the large fraction of tt events where the W-boson decays to a c-quark and a light quark, the effect of the btagging uncertainties on the c-jets is large. Other significant contributions come from the effect of b-tagging on b-jets and light jets, and the jet energy scale and resolution. The generator comparison shows a large effect on both the template shapes and normalisations; it is the dominant uncertainty for the ttb e\u03bc analysis, while for the lepton-plus-jets analysis it is smaller due to a cancellation in these effects. Table 11 shows a summary of the uncertainties grouped into categories. The effect of each uncertainty is obtained as above and all sources of uncertainty within a category are added in quadrature to obtain the category uncertainty.

The cut-based analysis is largely insensitive to the modelling of the non-ttbb background from tt events as the selection criteria are very tight. In contrast, the fit-based analysis uses looser selection criteria in an attempt to obtain a data-driven constraint on these processes. While the precision of the fit-based analysis does not allow for a measurement of these backgrounds, it does confirm the validity of the simulation, and allows for an explicit measurement of the R ttbb ratio. The two ttbb measurements select different events and hence are not fully correlated. A small excess of data with respect to the nominal prediction is seen in the events that are common to both measurements, while a small deficit is seen for events with jets that satisfy the MV1c 80 % criterion but fail the MV1 70 % criterion that is used in the cut-based analysis.
