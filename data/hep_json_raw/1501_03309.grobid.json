Flavour-changes can occur only through the charged current weak interaction, so transitions between fermions of the same charge can only occur through loop processes [1]. The probabilities of different transitions are governed by the elements of the appropriate fermion mixing matrices. In particular, the fact that the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) quark-mixing matrix [2,3] is found to be approximately diagonal suppresses generation-changing transitions.",

Decays of b hadrons into final states containing a photon or a dilepton pair (e + e \u2212 , \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) are of particular interest, and are the main topic of this review. The rates and various kinematic distributions as well as CP asymmetries, and other properties, of such rare decays can be predicted in the SM with low theoretical uncertainty, while the measured quantities may be affected by physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM), also referred to as \"New Physics\" (NP). Comparisons of the predictions with the measurements therefore provide sensitive tests for BSM contributions.",

As shown in Fig. 1, the most prominent effect of charmonia in semileptonic decays is the narrow resonance peaks at q 2 = m 2 J/\u03c8 , m 2 \u03c8(2S) ; these q 2 regions have to be removed in experimental analyses. In principle, however, the presence of charmonia affects the entire q 2 region. In radiative decays and at large recoil all charmonia are off-shell and are suppressed [37,48]. At high q 2 a number of broad cc resonances can contribute [49,50]. Such structure has been measured quite precisely in the B + \u2192 K + \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 decay [51], as shown in Fig. 2. Under a na\u00efve factorisation assumption, this structure can be compared to that from e + e \u2212 \u2192 hadrons [52,53] using dispersion relations [49]. Such a comparison [54] revealed a dramatic deviation from expectation. Although na\u00efve factorisation is not expected to be valid at high precision, this surprising difference needs to be understood in order to maximise the sensitivity to NP.",

The axialvector coupling through C 10 allows to distinguish between amplitudes with a leftand right-handed chirality of the dilepton system. For completeness, it should be noted that a fourth amplitude (A t ) exists corresponding to the spin-0 + \u2212 configuration. The effect of this amplitude is however suppressed by the small lepton mass. In BSM models with (pseudo)-scalar operators the effect of A t can be enhanced, and a further amplitude, A S , appears.

The measurement of the inclusive B(B \u2192 X d \u03b3) is very challenging for any experiment, but has nonetheless been performed by BaBar [109]. Perhaps more promising is the possibility to use exclusive decays, such as B(B 0 \u2192 \u03c1 0 \u03b3)/B(B 0 \u2192 K * 0 \u03b3) [68,69]. Results have been presented by both BaBar [110] and Belle [111], and give a precision on |V td /V ts | of about 10%. Further reduction in the experimental uncertainty can be anticipated with results from LHCb, which has demonstrated its potential to reconstruct B 0 \u2192 K * 0 \u03b3 [112] by making the most precise determination of its CP asymmetry. Indeed, CP asymmetries of both inclusive and exclusive radiative The value of A CP (B \u2192 K * \u03b3) is the average for the B 0 decay which is much more precise than the value for the B + decay. The value of A CP (B \u2192 X s \u03b3) is dominated by a result from BaBar [115]. All such measurements to date are consistent with the SM as shown in Table 3. Several methods to measure the photon polarisation have been proposed. One of the most promising exploits the interference between B 0 and B 0 decays when the hadronic system in the B \u2192 f \u03b3 decay is accessible to both. In such a case, the decay time dependent asymmetry can be written",

Data taking at the LHC, in Run II and beyond, will provide large increases in the yields of dimuon decays. The experiments will benefit both from the increased cross-section for production of b quarks, which is expected to scale approximately linearly with the centre-ofmass energy, and from the high luminosity. The increased yields will allow not only improved branching fraction measurements, and a determination of their ratio, but also a study of the effective lifetime in B 0 s \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 decays [194].

Generically, in these models flavour violation beyond the CKM matrix is induced. Severe constraints on masses and couplings must be imposed for the NP to maintain contact with the electroweak scale: without any flavour suppression (which could be SM-like, with GIM-and CKM-like effects) then NP is pushed up to scales as high as 10 5 TeV[65]. In turn, the nonobservation of BSM effects in the flavour sector provides important information about NP.Minimal flavour violationStandardModel extensions can be classified according to their amount of flavour violation. The term minimal flavour violation (MFV) is used for models where flavour is broken in an SM-like way. Formally, within MFV the spurion fields which break the flavour symmetry that would be present in the SM in the absence of quark masses correspond to the SM Yukawa couplings [66]. Hence the flavour violation can be parametrised in terms of quark masses and CKM elements, which are known parameters of the SM. Any deviation from MFV corresponds to NP. The MFV paradigm provides an attractive way to resolve the tension between the expectation that the NP scale should be O(1 TeV) due to naturalness arguments, while limits from FCNC processes assuming generic NP couplings point to a much higher scale. Still, viable non-MFV models exist with BSM around the TeV scale or higher. The MFV framework can be tested through CP violating observables as well as rare decays. Since, as discussed in Sec. 2.1, the effective Hamiltonians for b \u2192 d and b \u2192 s transitions share the same structure, ratios of b \u2192 d and b \u2192 s processes provide powerful tests of MFV. Generically, such ratios can be predicted in the SM to be equal to |V td /V ts | 2 \u2248 1/25 modified by hadronic matrix elements and phase space factors, while in non-MFV models they can take very different values. One important example is the ratio of B 0 and B 0 s dimuon decay rates [67], but B(B 0 \u2192 \u03c1\u03b3)/B(B 0 \u2192 K * 0 \u03b3) [68, 69] and B(B + \u2192 \u03c0 + + \u2212 )/B(B + \u2192 K + + \u2212 ) [70] exhibit similar features.

In the SM, the CP asymmetries of B \u2192 K * \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 and B \u2192 K\u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 decays are tiny, O(10 \u22123 ), due to the small numerical size of theproduct of CKM elements V ub V * us compared to V tb V* ts .

For |\u2206B| = |\u2206D| = 1 transitions, the CKM suppression in the SM is stronger and an analogous bound would imply a stronger constraint on \u039b NP in models without flavour-suppression by |V ts /V td | \u223c 2. If explicit flavour factors, \u03bb\u03bb * , are introduced for the BSM contribution, rare decays provide constraints on the combination \u03bb\u03bb * /\u039b 2 NP . In contrast, B-B mixing constrains the combination (\u03bb\u03bb * ) 2 /\u039b 2 NP . Similarly in the SM, the loop contribution to mixing is proportional to G F |V tb V * ts | 2 . Due to the stronger CKM suppression and in view of the strong constraints on CP violation in mixing, mixing bounds on \u039b NP are typically more powerful than those from rare decays with two important exceptions. The first is where the \u2206B = 1 BSM amplitude arises at tree level but the \u2206B = 2 BSM amplitude is loop induced, as in leptoquark models. Second, if the flavour suppression in the BSM model is sufficiently strong, i.e. if \u03bb\u03bb * is small, rare decays provide more stringent constraints on \u039b NP .",
