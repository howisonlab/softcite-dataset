            "text": "Nuclear effects on neutrino reactions are expected to be a significant complication in current and future neutrino oscillation experiments seeking precision measurements of neutrino flavor transitions. Calculations of these nuclear effects are hampered by a lack of experimental data comparing neutrino reactions on free nucleons to neutrino reactions on nuclei. We present results from a novel technique that compares neutrino and antineutrino charged current quasielastic scattering on hydrocarbons to extract a cross section ratio of antineutrino charged current elastic reactions on free protons to charged current quasielastic reactions on the protons bound in a carbon nucleus. This measurement of nuclear effects is compared to models.",

            "text": "The cross sections for neutrino and antineutrino charged current quasielastic (CCQE) reactions on free nucleons, \u03bd n \u2192 \u2212 p and\u03bd p \u2192 + n, can be expressed in terms of nucleon form factors [1][2][3][4]. This prescription, with form factors constrained by electron nucleon elastic scattering and pion electroproduction data, accurately describes available neutrino interaction data on hydrogen and loosely bound deuterium targets [5][6][7][8][9]. On heavier, more tightly bound nuclei, the relativistic Fermi Gas (FG) model [10] modifies this formalism within the context of the impulse approximation to include a simple description of the initial state of bound nucleons within the nucleus, and has been extensively used in neutrino interaction generators. However, experiments with carbon, oxygen and iron targets [11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19] with neutrino energies of a few GeV have measured a significantly different, typically higher, quasielastic cross section than predicted by the FG model. Additionally, recent measurements of the CC-inclusive cross section have shown that nuclear effects are not well understood [20], and that the ratio of CC-inclusive cross section measurements on different nuclear targets cannot be described by the models available in generators [21], particularly in the elastic region.",

In the impulse approximation, the initial state nucleons are independent in the mean field of the nucleus, and therefore the neutrino energy and momentum transfer Q 2 can be estimated from the polar angle \u03b8 and momentum p of the final state lepton. However, the initial state prescription and multinucleon processes both disrupt this relationship in different ways [40][41][42]. MNP and collective RPA processes both alter the distribution of Q 2 which can in turn alter the relative acceptance of near and far detectors. Therefore understanding nuclear modifications is essential for the current and future generations of neutrino oscillation experiments.",

NEUT has implemented the Spectral Function (SF) model of Benhar [22,47] which describes the initial nucleon's correlated momentum and removal energy and includes short range nuclear correlations which affect \u223c20% of the CCQE rate. Nuclear screening due to long-range nucleon correlations is implemented in RPA calculations [30]. Calculations of MNP use the model of Nieves et al. [30,48]. NEUT also has implementations of two effective models constructed to ensure agreement with electron data, an Effective Spectral Function (ESF) [25,49,50] and the Transverse Enhancement Model (TEM) [50,51]. For all models, we use the BBBA05 vector nucleon form factors [52] and a dipole axial form factor with M A = 1.00 GeV, based on fits to bubble chamber data [6][7][8][9].",

            "text": ") ratio can be used to differentiate between nuclear models. Figure 3 and Table I show that the extracted MINER\u03bdA data have some power to differentiate between nuclear models, and that there is considerable tension between the data and all models tested. However, we have treated the NEUT nuclear models as having no free parameters, and have calculated \u03c7 2 values assuming nominal model parameters. This tension may well be reduced by considering changes to the model parameters, and indeed this measurement could be used to tune the parameters of any one model. Many of the models have no well defined theoretical uncertainties which can be varied in NEUT; however, the FG model does have a number of parameters which may be varied to estimate uncertainties within the base FG model, and we may additionally consider uncertainties in the axial form factor. To illustrate the possible reduction in tension due to modified nuclear model parameters, we consider variations in the FG of M A = 1.00 \u00b1 0.02 GeV [6][7][8][9], p F = 217 \u00b1 5 MeV [46], E b = 25 \u00b1 3 MeV [46] and variations of 3 MeV in E b for either neutrino or antineutrino to reflect uncertainty on whether the binding energy is the same for neutrons and protons. Additionally, we consider the 3% uncertainty on F P (0) recommended in Reference [43]; and take the difference between the non-dipole F A from Reference [7] and the dipole F A as a 1\u03c3 uncertainty. The uncertainties are combined in quadrature and compared to the fractional uncertainty on the data in Figure 4. The FG model uncertainty is most significant at low Q 2 and is dominated by the uncertainty on the Fermi momentum, p F . As the model bias of our measurement is smallest at low Q 2 , changing p F may improve the \u03c7 2 between our measurement and the predictions of the various FG based models considered in this work. We extend the \u03c7 2 calculation from Equation 6 to include a variable p F parameter with a penalty term based on the p F uncertainty from electron-scattering data [46]. The best fit \u03c7 2 and p F result for each of the FG based models is shown in Table II for MINER\u03bdA. The fit reduces p F slightly in order to reduce the value of 6\u03c3\u03bd H /\u03c3\u03bd C at low Q 2 QE , but there is no significant improvement in fit quality. As already commented, this study is illustrative only, modifying nu-  clear model uncertainties may well significantly reduce the tension for other models, but it is interesting that in the case of simple FG-based nuclear models, the tensions cannot be significantly reduced by playing with the model uncertainties. Improving the understanding of nuclear effects in neutrino scattering has become a focus for reducing systematic uncertainties in current and future neutrino oscillation experiments. As there are no current or future experiments which will take neutrino-nucleon scattering data in the few-GeV energy region, the method described here offers a unique opportunity to directly inspect the suppression or enhancement due to nuclear effects. The method exploits the fact that antineutrinos have additional interactions on free protons (from the hydrogen), and corrects for neutrino and antineutrino flux and cross section differences. It was expected to work well at low Q 2 , and be relatively free of axial form factor or other uncertainties, and proves to be relatively unbiased even at high Q 2 . The extracted measurement of nuclear effects in carbon is the first of its kind, and is easy to interpret for model builders. We conclude that models with nuclear screening due to long-range correlations must be balanced by the addition of multinucleon hard scattering processes, and that the combination of both effects is weakly favored over Fermi Gas models that only include the mean field of the nucleus. We also note that all of the models tested show considerable tension with the MINER\u03bdA data. Constraints from this measurement could be improved using future, higher statistics, MINER\u03bdA CCQE measurements. This method could be applied to cross section measurements in terms of different kinematic variables, although a high-Q 2 bias will remain.",

It can be observed from Figure 5 that at the fringe of the kinematically allowed region, where Fermi motion increases the allowed phase space for the RFG model, the ratio of bound to free cross sections changes rapidly. It is clear from Figure 6 that this change is different for neutrino and antineutrino modes. This implies that there will be a bias in the test statistic defined in Equation 3 for neutrino energies which cannot populate all Q 2 bins. MINER\u03bdA, where the flux has neutrino energies in the range 1.5 \u2264 E \u03bd \u2264 10 GeV, will not be affected by the bias. However, MiniBooNE, with neutrino energies of 0 \u2264 E \u03bd \u2264 3 GeV, will be affected, although the size of this bias on the test statistic is not clear from Figure 6. The biases are shown for both MINER\u03bdA and MiniBooNE in Figure 3. Note that the R(Q 2 ) defined in Equation 4 is the flux integrated 1/\u03be(E \u03bd , Q 2 ) for the case of the RFG model.  The Q 2 \u2192 Q 2 QE effect for the FG model is illustrated in Figure 7 for MINER\u03bdA, and Figure 8 for MiniBooNE. In both figures, the true Q 2 distribution is shown for events which populate each of the first 8 Q 2 QE bins of the experiments using events simulated using the FG model in NEUT with default model parameters. The smearing is not very significant for MINER\u03bdA, and is minimal in the lowest Q 2 QE bins. For MiniBooNE, the smearing becomes significant in the higher Q 2 QE bins (and this trend continues for the other bins not shown in Figure 8), but is minimal at low Q 2 QE . Q 2 QE is effectively an additional smearing effect on the Q 2 distribution measured by the experiments, which is dependent on the nuclear model. As such it is part of the measurement of nuclear effects, but it will smear the bias introduced by correcting for the antineutrino/neutrino cross section difference with the L-S model. This effect is not corrected for, but is included in the bias tests shown on Figure 3. Again, it is reassuring that the Q 2 QE smearing is minimal at low Q 2 .
