This report reviews the experimental situation on several fronts. The microwave cavity experiment is making excellent progress in the search for dark matter axions in the microelectronvolt range and may be plausibly extended up to 100 \u00b5eV. Within the past several years however, it has been realized that axions are pervasive throughout string theories, but with masses that fall naturally in the nanoelectronvolt range, for which a NMR-based search is under development. Searches for axions emitted from the Sun's burning core, and purely laboratory experiments based on photon regeneration have both made great strides in recent years, with ambitious projects proposed for the coming decade. Each of these campaigns has pushed the state of the art in technology, enabling large gains in sensitivity and mass reach. Furthermore each modality has also been exploited to search for more generalized axion-like particles, that will also be discussed in this report. We are hopeful, even optimistic, that the next review of the subject will concern the discovery of the axion, its properties, and its exploitation as a probe of early universe cosmology and structure formation.",

            "text": "Since its prediction in 1978 (1,2), there has been a steady crescendo of interest in the axion, and a coordinated global effort to find it is now finally taking shape. Should it ultimately be discovered, it would finally resolve one of the last outstanding questions in the Standard Model of particle physics, namely it would validate the Peccei-Quinn mechanism to protect the strong interaction from CP-violating effects (3,4), as evidenced by the absence of a neutron electric dipole moment. Furthermore, it may be discovered as the dark matter halo of our Milky Way galaxy, thus answering the question of what constitutes the predominant form of matter in our Universe. This will be an experimental review, focusing on new concepts and developments since the last such report in this journal (5) and in others (6,7). The reader is referred to several excellent theory reviews (8,9,10,11,12) that are still largely up to date. There is one new development of interest to our present purpose however, namely the realization that any string theory contains several and perhaps a large number of axion-like particles, although they are extremely light, of order neV. This will be discussed briefly in Sec. 3.4, before describing the NMR-based experiment to search that mass region. Nevertheless, some theoretical preliminaries are in order, therefore this review will begin with the basic physics underlying the axion and its phenomenology in Sec. 2. Constraints on the axion's mass and couplings primarily from its cosmological production and astrophysics will be introduced at the beginning of Sec. 3 to prepare for the discussion of the microwave cavity experiment. Axion-photon mixing within a magnetic field in the relativistic limit relevant both to the solar searches and laboratory experiments will be presented at the beginning of Sec. 4, along with axion emission from the Sun's burning core.",

This is achieved by introducing an extra global symmetry into the theory (3,4), i.e., by considering \u03b8 as a field, not a fixed parameter. Such a symmetry leads in turn to the prediction of a new light pseudoscalar particle, the axion (1,2). In a restricted sense, the axion plays a role similar to the Higgs boson; the CP violating interaction cannot be calculated in the context of the Standard Model and in fact diverges without the axion, while electroweak interactions beyond first order diverge without the (now discovered!) Higgs boson. Of course it would be incorrect to say that the axion is as well motivated as the Higgs boson, however the parallelism should be noted.",

While entirely unrelated to the Strong-CP problem, ALPs and HPs may also be viable dark matter candidates (26,27). ALPs are of special interest, because there are a number of different astrophysics phenomena like the transparency of the universe to TeV photons (28,29) and evolution of stars (30,31), which might point to the existence of very light ALPs with a coupling strength detectable at the next generation of helioscopes and purely laboratory experiments. It should be stressed that the ongoing discussion on the validity of Naturalness (questioning arguments for the existence of new particles based on fine tuning issues) triggered by the results of the first run of LHC (see (32,33) for example) does not influence the hints for WISPs as sketched here. Thus the parameter space for very light and very feebly interacting particles is opening up next to the axion region and experiments are encouraged to widen their field of view accordingly.",

Without tuning of the initial misalignment angle much lighter axions would overclose the universe, and therefore ma \u2248 1 \u00b5eV may be taken as a strong lower limit on the axion mass, ma. There has been a lingering controversy about the relative contribution between axion production from the vacuum realignment mechanism and radiation from topological defects (axion strings, domain walls). A definitive resolution is unlikely soon, but the current general consensus is that the sum of all contributions to \u2126a could push the axion mass corresponding to \u2126DM two orders of magnitude higher. As we are presently interested only in establishing conservative ranges for experiments searches should plan on reaching the \u00b5eV scale. Cosmology also provides an upper bound on the axion mass by the production of thermal axions, the hot dark matter limit of about 1 eV, but this does not concern us here. Stellar evolution also places strict limits on axions (35). Axions of mass exceeding \u223c 16 meV would have quenched the neutrino pulse observed from SN1987a, thus bounding the axion mass from above. The best indirect stellar bound on the axion-photon coupling comes from Galactic Globular Clusters, ga\u03b3\u03b3 < 0.66 \u00d7 10 \u221210 GeV \u22121 , recently surpassing the best direct stellar bound, the CAST search for solar axions, ga\u03b3\u03b3 \u2248 0.88\u00d710 \u221210 GeV \u22121 discussed in Sec. 4. For Peccei-Quinn axions, such couplings correspond to masses far in excess of the open mass region, i.e. 10 \u22126 eV < ma < 10 \u22122 eV, and thus are not germane to the dark matter problem. There has been a modest literature in recent years suggesting that the luminosity function of white dwarfs (degenerate stars undergoing gravothermal cooling)  may require an additional cooling mechanism that could be accounted for by axions in the \u223c 10 meV range (36,37,38). The evidence is far from compelling, not to mention that such masses are beginning to encroach in the region disfavored by SN1987a.",

The integration time is t, and the bandwidth of the axion signal is \u2206\u03bd, where it is assumed that the resolution of the spectral receiver is much better than the width of the axion signal. One especially important feature about the microwave cavity search for axions that strongly differentiates it from WIMP searches, is that it is a total energy detector, i.e. the signal represents the instantaneous (mass + kinetic) energy of the axion. While the majority of the signal strength will almost certainly be found in a broad quasi-Maxwellian distribution of width \u2206\u03bd \u03bd \u223c 10 \u22126 , there has been a great deal of speculation and research over the past two decades about the phase space structure of the axion signal, caustics, fine structure due to late infall axions, etc. (43). A high resolution channel has been implemented on ADMX based on a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of an entire subspectrum, the basic unit of data collection, which can resolve structure down to the transform limit, e.g. \u2206\u03bd \u03bd \u223c 10 \u221211 for a 100-second run at 1 GHz. Due to the motion of the laboratory through the dark-matter halo (vROT \u223c 0.4 km/sec, vORB \u223c 30 km/sec), any fine structure would exhibit both diurnal and sidereal modulations in frequency. A little reflection makes it clear that should such fine structure be found, fitting the amplitude and phase of the diurnal and sidereal oscillation in frequency would uniquely determine each vector flow to high precision, truly opening the field of dark matter astronomy (44). While N-body simulations strongly support a hierarchical and chaotic picture of structure formation, these simulations themselves exhibit significant mesoscale substructure in phase space, which could be studied.",

Linear amplifiers are ultimately subject to an irreducible noise contribution, the Standard Quantum Limit, kTSQL = h\u03bd. The Rydberg-atom singlequantum detector can effectively be thought of as a tunable \"RF photomultiplier tube\", for which the photon interacts as a particle rather than a wave, thus circumventing the SQL. Tada et al. were able to measure the the blackbody photon spectrum of the cavity at 2.527 GHz as a function of temperature all the way down to T = 67 mK, nearly a factor of two below the Standard Quantum Limit of TSQL \u223c 120 mK (48). From the technical perspective, CARRACK was successful, but ultimately proved too complex to be feasible as a production experiment.",

            "text": "A second smaller ADMX platform has been constructed and commissioned at Yale, precisely to develop technologies and techniques applicable to the next higher decade in mass (54). The NbTi solenoidal magnet (9.4 T, 60 cm \u00d7 110 cm) was designed for exceptionally high field uniformity (Br < 50 G) for the purposes of testing thin-film superconducting cavities, although initially the cavity is elec- trodeposited copper ( Figure 5). ADMX-HF incorporated a dilution refrigerator from the outset, resulting in a base temperature of the experiment T \u223c 25 mK. Josephson Parametric Amplfiers (JPA) are well suited to the initial 5 GHz range of the experiment, where they possess high gain (20-30 dB), are tunable over an octave and can operate with a system noise temperature TN \u223c TSQL (55, 56); this noise was achieved within a factor of two in its first commissioning run. In its initial configuration, the experiment is projected to reach a sensitivity in axion-photon coupling \u223c 2 \u00d7 KSVZ. Two promising lines of R&D are currently being pursued with high priority. The first is the prospect of incorporating Type-II superconducting thin films on all cylindrical surfaces of the microwave cavity to boost the Q by an order of magnitude, to which the axionphoton conversion power and thereby scanning rate are directly proportional. Xi et al. have recently demonstrated that very thin films of NbxTi1\u2212xN are perfectly microwave reflecting to frequencies > 100 GHz, immersed a magnetic field parallel to its surface up to B || = 10 T (57). Encouraged by this report, a program has been initiated of making and characterizing thin (10-200 nm) NbTiN films by RF plasma deposition. Satisfactory films on planar samples were readily achieved that are non-critical in exact composition ( Figure 5). RF tests of small prototype cavities will be conducted next, and finally testing  them in a magnetic field. Successful implementation in ADMX-HF will require minimizing lossy flux vortices penetrating the superconducting surfaces; this requires the film be both extremely thin, and parallel to the magnetic field. To this end, the magnet was designed to meet strict specifications on field uniformity to minimize radial components. The other major R&D effort will be the incorporation of a receiver based on squeezedvacuum states to evade the quantum limit in noise, employed so far only by the laser interferometric gravity wave community, i.e. LIGO and GEO. The JILA group in ADMX-HF have used one JPA to measure the squeezed noise generated by a second JPA (58) achieving an equivalent noise temperature TN = h\u03bd/4. Indeed, this experiment can be regarded as a proof-of-principle demonstration of a quantum-noise evading axion search. Not only was it possible to measure noise in one quadrature below the standard quantum limit, but also to demonstrate that quadrature had fluctuations below vacuum because it had been squeezed. The system noise could conceivably be reduced to 1/10 of the quantum limit. Together with the gain associated with the superconducting thin-film cavity, this small-volume experiment could ultimately reach DFSZ sensitivity.",

As the conversion probability maximizes strongly when the applied magnetic field B(r) follows the electric field of the photon mode E(r), a wiggler-like magnetic field is required with a continuously tunable periodicity to sweep out the range of masses. Rybka et al. effect this with a series of wire planes in the open resonator of alternating sign in current; ultimately these planes will consist of superconducting wires or stripes patterned on a thin substrate. A first prototype was able to exclude axions as the dark matter between 68.2 and 76.5 \u00b5eV, with couplings ga\u03b3\u03b3 > 4 \u00d7 10 \u22127 GeV \u22121 , not far removed from existing limits from laserbased limits, remarkably with a magnetic field of |B| < 10 gauss.

What they propose to circumvent this limitation is replacing the cavity with a lumped-parameter LC circuit external to the magnetic field, excited by a pickup loop inside the magnet threaded by the transverse B-field of the mode. Optimistically, the authors represent that with a magnet such as that of the the current ADMX, this technique would be maximally sensitive around 10 \u22127 eV, probing the band of Peccei-Quinn axion models. If the concept can be fully developed and implemented, such a lumped-parameter LC circuit search for dark matter axions could bridge a key gap between where the cavity-based experiment and the NMR-based experiment may have difficulty in overlapping.",

CASPEr-Electric requires a more complicated material such as a ferroelectric or polar crystal with a large internal electric field, but it has a better ultimate sensitivity, allowing it to reach all the way to the QCD axion over several orders of magnitude in frequency space that are unreachable by other techniques as in Figure 8 3 .",

For particular nonhadronic axion models having a tree-level coupling with electrons gaee, other productions channels like axion recombination, bremsstrahlung or Compton (i.e. ABC reactions (90)) should be taken into account. As shown in Fig. 9, if present, this additional solar axion flux could be a factor \u223c 10 2 larger that the standard Primakoff one, while having lower energies, peaking at \u223c1 keV. However, astrophysical limits on gaee are quite restrictive and largely disfavour the values that could be reached by helioscopes looking at the non-hadronic solar axion flux. In the future IAXO (see Section 4.4) may have sensitivity to ABC solar axions for non-excluded values of gaee. Finally, axion emission in solar nuclear transitions, by virtue of axion-nucleon interactions has also been considered in the literature. By means of the a\u03b3\u03b3 vertex, solar axions can be efficiently converted back into photons in the presence of an electromagnetic field. In crystalline detectors (91,92,93), this effect gives rise to characteristic Bragg patterns that have been searched for as by-products of a number of underground WIMP experiments (94,95,96,97,98). However, the prospects of this technique have proven limited (99, 100) and do not compete with dedicated helioscope experiments that use a powerful magnet to effect the conversion. Solar axion detection by means of the axioelectric effect in the detector (101,102,103,104,105) or, for monochro-matic axions emitted in solar nuclear transitions, the resonant absorption by the same nuclide at the detector (106,107,108,109), have also been considered. While interesting for some specific WISP models, all these techniques remain far from the sensitivity required to probe QCD axion models and/or parameter space not excluded by astrophysics. So far only axion helioscopes have reached relevant QCD axion parameter space.",

To mitigate the loss of coherence, a buffer gas can be introduced into the magnet beam pipes (111,112) to impart an effective mass to the photons m\u03b3 = \u03c9p (where \u03c9p is the plasma frequency of the gas, \u03c9 2 p = 4\u03c0\u03b1ne/me). For axion masses that match the photon mass, q = 0 and full coherence is restored. By changing the pressure of the gas inside the pipe in a controlled manner, the photon mass can be systematically increased and the sensitivity of the experiment can be extended to higher axion masses. ( The basic layout of an axion helioscope thus requires a powerful magnet coupled to one or more x-ray detectors. When the magnet is aligned with the Sun, an excess of x-rays at the exit of the magnet is expected, over the background measured at non-alignment periods. This detection concept was first experimentally realized at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) in 1992. A stationary dipole magnet with a field of B = 2.2 T and a length of L = 1.8 m was oriented towards the setting Sun (113). The experiment derived an upper limit on ga\u03b3\u03b3 (99% CL) < 3.6 \u00d7 10 \u22129 GeV \u22121 for ma < 0.03 eV. At the University of Tokyo, a second-generation experiment was built: the SUMICO axion heliscope. Not only did this experiment implement dynamic tracking of the Sun but it also used a more powerful magnet (B = 4 T, L = 2.3 m) than its BNL predecessor. The bore, located between the two coils of the magnet, was evacuated and higher-performance detectors were installed (114,115,116). This new setup resulted in an improved upper limit in the mass range up to 0.03 eV of ga\u03b3\u03b3(95% CL) < 6.0 \u00d7 10 \u221210 GeV \u22121 . Later experimental improvements included the additional use of a buffer gas to enhance sensitivity to higher-mass axions.",

            "text": "A third-generation experiment, the CERN Axion Solar Telescope (CAST), began data collection in 2003 and is still in operation. The experiment uses a Large Hadron Collider (LHC) dipole prototype magnet with a magnetic field of up to 9 T over a length of 9.3 m (117). CAST is able to follow the Sun for several hours per day using an elevation and azimuth drive. This CERN experiment is the first helioscope to employ x-ray focusing optics for one of its four detector lines (118), as well as low background techniques from detectors in underground laboratories (119,120,121). During its observational program from 2003 to 2011, CAST operated first with its magnet bores under vacuum (2003)(2004) to probe masses ma < 0.02 eV. No significant signal above background was observed. Thus, an upper limit on the axion-to-photon coupling of ga\u03b3\u03b3 (95% CL) < 8.8 \u00d7 10 \u221211 GeV \u22121 was obtained (110,89). The experiment was then upgraded to be operated with 4 He (2005-2006) and 3 He gas (2008-2011) to obtain continuous, high sensitivity up to an axion mass of ma = 1.17 eV. Data released up to now provide an average limit of ga\u03b3\u03b3 (95% CL) 2.3 \u00d7 10 \u221210 GeV \u22121 , for the higher mass range of 0.02 eV < ma < 0.64 eV (112,122) and of about ga\u03b3\u03b3 (95% CL) 3.3 \u00d7 10 \u221210 GeV \u22121 for 0.64 eV < ma < 1.17 eV (123), with the exact value depending on the pressure setting. The envelope of all these limits is shown in Fig. 10. Byproducts of CAST include the search for 14.4 keV solar axions emitted in the M1 transition of 57 Fe nuclei (124), the search from MeV axions from 7 Li and D(p, \u03b3) 3 He nuclear transitions (125), the search for solar axions from ABC reactions (126), and the search of more exotic ALP or WISP models, like chameleon particles also potentially emitted in the sun (127,128). As part of the R&D to assess the technologies for the next generation axion helioscope IAXO, new lower background Micromegas detectors are actively being developed (120,121), and a new x-ray telescope coupled with one such detector being built and installed in CAST in 2014. This improved equipment is currently allowing CAST to revisit the 4 He (in 2012) and vacuum (in 2013-15) configurations with an incremental improvement in sensitivity.",

As shown in Fig. 10, in the region of higher axion masses (ma 0.1 eV), the experiment has entered the band of QCD axion models for the first time and excluded KSVZ axions of specific mass values. CAST is the largest collaboration in axion physics with \u223c 70 physicists from about 16 different institutions in Europe and the USA.

However, for this figure of merit to directly translate into signal-to-noise ratio of the overall experiment for a large aperture magnet, the entire cross sectional area of the magnet must be equipped with x-ray focusing optics. The layout of this enhanced axion helioscope, sketched in Figure 11, was proposed (129) as the basis for IAXO. The project is at the point of conceptual design, recently finished (130), and it is now moving into the realization of the technical design report, including some prototyping activities.

The magnet is supported by a tracking system similar to that of large telescopes. Figure 11 shows the conceptual design of the infrastructure (130). Each of the bores will be equipped with x-ray optics similar to those used on NASA's NuS-TAR (133), an x-ray astrophysics satellite with two focusing telescopes that operate in the 3 -79 keV band, consisting of thousands of thermally-formed glass substrates deposited with multilayer coatings. For IAXO, the multilayer coatings will be designed to match the solar axion spectrum (134). At the focal plane in each of the optics, IAXO will have small gaseous chambers read by pixelated planes of Micromegas, surrounded by active and passive shielding. These detectors are being developed (135,136,137,138) for rare event searches and they show promise to reach background levels below \u223c10 \u22127 counts keV \u22121 cm \u22122 s \u22121 in IAXO (120,121).

IAXO will thus deeply enter into unexplored ALP and axion parameter space, as indicated by Fig. 10. At the lowest mass values, IAXO will test ALP models invoked to explain the anomalies in light propagation over astronomical distances. At the high mass part, ma > 1 meV, IAXO will explore a broad range of QCD axion models. Its sensitivity would reach axion models with masses down to the few meV range, superseding the SN 1987A energy loss limits on the axion mass and entering parameter space of progressively higher cosmological interest. At the higher part of the range (0.1 -1 eV) axions are good candidates to the hot DM or additional dark radiation that could restore agreement in cosmological parameters. IAXO could also be sensitive to ABC solar axion for non-excluded values of gaee and thus directly test the models invoked to solve the anomalous cooling observed for white dwarfs (139,140,38). Additional equipment beyond the baseline configuration (like InGrid detectors, Transition Edge Sensors or low noise CCDs (131)) would extend the detection energy window, and thus explore other less standard physics cases (e.g. the possibility to directly detect the cosmic axion background predicted by some dark radiation models). Finally, the possibility to equip the huge magnetic volume of IAXO with microwave cavities or antennas sensitive to relic axions is being studied, with promising preliminary projections (141) in mass ranges complementary with previous haloscope searches.",

At ALPS II continuous wave infrared light (1064 nm) with a power of up to 35 W is provided by a single-mode single-frequency laser system. Through a curved mirror the laser light is injected into the cavity in front of the wall which is locked via the Pound-Drever-Hall (PDH) sensing scheme (157). This ALPS II cavity is designed for a power build-up FRC = 5, 000 providing a circulating power of 150 kW and limiting the power density on the mirrors to 500 kW/cm 2 , about an order of magnitude below their damage thresholds. To allow for locking the cavity behind the wall with the PDH method, a fraction of the 1064 nm light is frequency-doubled to 532 nm in a KTP crystal and fed  into the cavity targeting for a power build-up of FRC = 40, 000. For future experiments beyond ALPS II one could think of increasing the circulating light power in front of the wall by another order of magnitude (see also (149)) and to improve on FRC by advanced seismic isolations of the optical components for example. ALPS II will use a Transition Edge Sensor (TES) (158,159) based on a thin superconducting Tungsten film (25 \u00b5m \u2022 25 \u00b5m \u2022 20 nm) as photon detectors. 1064 nm photons appear as fast pulses with a decay time of about 1.5 \u00b5s. The intrinsic background is below 10 \u22124 counts per second, the energy resolution for single infrared photons is better than 10% and the whole system can be operated stably over long time scales (160,161,162). Infrared photon detection sensitivity well below mHz rates should be achievable.",

This limits the ALPS II setup to a total length of about 200 m for example, which represents 20 HERA dipole magnets 5 . In the far future one could imagine magnet strings based on the dipoles under development at CERN (163,164) offering a field of about 13 T with an aperture of about 100 mm if the high Tc superconducting inner part is removed (see JURA 6 in Table 1).",

However, at present no concept exists on how to access the QCD axion with purely laboratory based experiments. Only once the axion mass is known from dark matter experiments for example, one could think of optimizing the sensitivity of LSW experiments accordingly (165). Figure 14 schematically represents the current limits on the photon coupling of axions and axion-like particles, and the projected extension of these results with ongoing upgrades within the next five years; companion Figures 7 and 8 summarize the reach of future NMR experiments for lower mass axions through their nucleon coupling. Along with experiments still in the conceptual or prototype phase, these constitute, for the first time, the emergence of a complete strategy to definitively answer the question of the existence of the axion, and its cosmological role, from the neV to meV mass range. It is interesting to note that it has been the mass coverage rate, not the sensitivity of all dark-matter axion searches that has been the limiting factor. If the mass were known virtually any microwave cavity experiment would be able to detect the axion, with sufficient integration time. In fact, if the axion were discovered, it would quickly become a senior undergraduate physics laboratory experiment. The heart of the issue with tuning high-Q experiments is that their exquisite sensitivity accrues as a trade-off for spectral bandwidth, thus necessitating tuning over a decade or more of mass.",
