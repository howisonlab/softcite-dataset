The cross sections are measured in the electron-muon channel using a binned likelihood fit to multi-differential final state distributions related to identified b quark jets and other jets in the event. The measured cross section values are 173.6 \u00b1 2.1 (stat) + 4.5 \u2212 4.0 (syst) \u00b1 3.8 (lumi) pb at \u221a s = 7 TeV, and 244.9 \u00b1 1.4(stat) + 6.3 \u2212 5.5 (syst) \u00b1 6.4 (lumi) pb at \u221a s = 8 TeV, in good agreement with QCD calculations at next-to-nextto-leading-order accuracy. The ratio of the cross sections measured at 7 and 8 TeV is determined, as well as cross sections in the fiducial regions defined by the acceptance requirements on the two charged leptons in the final state. The cross section results are used to determine the top quark pole mass via the dependence of the theoretically predicted cross section on the mass, giving a best result of 173.8 +1.7   \u22121.8 GeV. The data at \u221a s = 8 TeV are also used to set limits, for two neutralino mass values, on the pair production of supersymmetric partners of the top quark with masses close to the top quark mass.",

The total production cross section, \u03c3 tt , can be accurately predicted by quantum chromodynamics (QCD) calculations at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO). A measurement of \u03c3 tt can thus provide constraints on essential ingredients in the calculation, such as the top quark mass, the proton JHEP08(2016)029 parton distribution functions (PDFs), and the strong coupling \u03b1 s . Furthermore, deviations from these predictions can be an indication of physics beyond the SM. For example, in supersymmetric (SUSY) models, tt pairs may appear as decay products of heavier new particles, increasing the tt yields.",

The measurement is performed in the e\u00b5 channel, where each W boson from the top quark decays into a charged lepton and a neutrino. Compared to the previous CMS analyses in the dilepton channel at 7 TeV [8] and 8 TeV [1], the new measurement is performed using the complete CMS data samples recorded in the years 2011 and 2012, with integrated luminosities of 5.0 and 19.7 fb \u22121 at \u221a s = 7 and 8 TeV, respectively. The restriction to the e\u00b5 channel provides a pure tt event sample owing to the negligible contamination from Z/\u03b3 * processes with same-flavoured leptons in the final state. The event selection is based on the kinematic properties of the leptons. An improved cross section extraction method is used, performing a template fit of the signal and background contributions to multi-differential binned distributions related to the multiplicity of b quark jets (referred to as b jets in the following) and the multiplicity and transverse momenta of other jets in the event. The results obtained with this method (referred to as the \"reference method\" in the following) are cross-checked with an analysis performed using an event counting method.",

            "text": "As the tt events are expected to contain mainly jets from the hadronisation of b quarks, requiring the presence of b jets can reduce background from events without b quarks. Jets are identified as b jets (b-tagged) using the combined secondary vertex algorithm [64]. The discriminator threshold chosen for the reference method to extract the cross section corresponds to an identification efficiency for b jets of about 50% and a misidentification (mistag) probability of about 10% for c quark jets and 0.1% for light-flavour jets (u, d, s, and gluons). A looser discriminator threshold is chosen for the event counting method such that the efficiency is about 70% for jets originating from b quarks and 20% for c quark jets, while the probability of mistagging for jets originating from light flavours is around 1% [64]. For the reference method there are no constraints on the number of jets and b-tagged jets in the event. Figures 1 and 2 show for the 7 and 8 TeV data and simulations, respectively, the p T and \u03b7 distributions of the highest (leading) and second-highest (subleading) p T lepton from the selected e\u00b5 pair, after the e\u00b5 selection is applied. The data are compared to the expected distributions for the tt signal and individual backgrounds, which are derived from MC simulated samples. The contributions from QCD multijet, W + jets, and tt background processes arise from events where at least one jet is incorrectly reconstructed as a lepton or a lepton that does not originate from a prompt W or Z boson decay fulfils the selection criteria. These contributions are referred to as \"non W/Z\" background.",

            "text": "Top squark pair production with the top squarks decaying into a top quark and a neutralino could produce final states very similar to the one from tt production but with additional missing transverse energy. If the difference between the masses of the top squark and the neutralino is close to the top quark mass, the events would have similar topologies to the SM tt events. In such situations, direct top squark searches have low sensitivity because of the overwhelming tt background. However, from a very precise tt cross section measurement, top squark pair events can be searched for by looking for a small excess in the measured cross section compared to the SM expectation. The study presented here is complementary to the direct searches performed by CMS [84][85][86] and ATLAS [87][88][89], as it is more sensitive in a mass region, m( t) \u2248 m( \u03c7 0 1 )+m t , that is not accessible to conventional SUSY searches. Previous indirect searches in this mass region have been performed by the ATLAS collaboration [27,90].",
