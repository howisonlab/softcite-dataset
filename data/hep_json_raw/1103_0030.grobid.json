            "text": "New heavy gauge bosons, generally indicated as Z and W , are predicted in various extensions of the standard model (SM). Such extensions include Left-Right Symmetric Models [1][2][3], Compositeness models [4] and Little Higgs models [5]. The search for a W is usually performed in the context of the benchmark model of Ref. [6], where the W boson is considered a heavy analogue of the SM W boson with the same left-handed fermionic couplings. Thus the W decay modes and branching fractions are similar to those of the W boson, with the notable exception of the tb channel, which opens up for W masses above 180 GeV. No interaction with the SM gauge bosons or with other heavy gauge bosons such as Z is assumed. In this context, CDF [7] and D0 [8] searched for a W boson in the decay to an electron and a neutrino, and excluded W masses below 1.1 TeV at the 95% confidence level (C.L.). Recently, a search in this decay channel by CMS extended the lower limit on the W mass to 1.36 TeV [9].",

One lepton candidate, called the \"tag\", satisfies the trigger criteria and all identification and isolation requirements. The other lepton candidate, called the \"probe\", is used to determine the efficiency of specific criteria under study. The combined muon identification efficiency is measured to be 95%, including efficiencies for the muon reconstruction, the muon selection requirements, the isolation, and the inner track measured by the silicon strip tracker. The value for the combined efficiency is very similar in data and simulation, with the data/MC ratio being 99%. The trigger efficiency is studied with two complementary methods, the first one using tag-and-probe in dimuon events and the second one using a sample of jet-triggered data, which result in the trigger efficiencies of 92% and 91%, respectively, differing in data and simulation by 4%. Muons from a W would have higher momenta than those used in the tag-and-probe studies. So far, only muons up to p T = 240 GeV from pp collisions have been recorded and efficiency studies for O(500) GeV muons are done with simulated W samples. The combined efficiency does not depend on p T despite the fact that the showering probability in the iron yoke increases with the muon energy.

A relativistic Breit-Wigner function is used as an ad-hoc empirical shape to fit the M T distribution in the side band, both in the simulation and the data. The parameters of the fitting  function are then used to calculate the number of expected background events in the different bins of M T outside the side band. The choice of the side band lower and upper limits is made in order to minimize the contribution from a hypothetical W signal and find a region that gives reliable extrapolations of the background in the signal region, based on simulation studies. According to the simulation, 71 \u00b1 8 events are expected in the side band region for the combination of all SM backgrounds, for an integrated luminosity of 36 pb \u22121 . The signal contamination would be 1.63 \u00b1 0.07 or 0.17 \u00b1 0.01 W events for a mass of 1.0 and 1.4 TeV, respectively. In the data, this region contains 52 events, consistent with the prediction within the systematic uncertainties in luminosity, background composition and theoretical uncertainties. Even though we believe that the fit sideband method gives a good estimate of the number of expected background events, we follow a conservative approach: the difference between the predicted SM background from simulation and the sideband-fit result in the data is taken as the systematic uncertainty in the determination of the expected background in the signal region. The robustness of this method has been tested by varying the binning of the M T distribution and the interval range defining the sideband region, and it was confirmed that it does not introduce any significant systematic uncertainties. Unlike in the electron channel [9], high-p T cosmic ray muons constitute an additional source of background for this analysis. Their spectrum shows a different M T dependence from that of the dominant W boson contribution. Cosmic ray muons are identified with a transverse impact parameter with respect to the beam spot larger than 0.02 cm. The number of cosmic ray muons expected after this requirement is determined to be between 0.15 \u00b1 0.04 for M T > 350 GeV and 0.08 \u00b1 0.03 for M T > 600 GeV.",
