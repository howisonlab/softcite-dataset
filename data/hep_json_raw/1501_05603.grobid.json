The existence of such particles could be deduced from observation of their decays via energy deposits in the CMS calorimeter appearing at times that are well separated from any proton-proton collisions. Using a data set corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 18.6 fb \u22121 of 8 TeV proton-proton collisions, and a search interval corresponding to 281 h of trigger livetime, 10 events are observed, with a background prediction of 13.2 +3.6   \u22122.5 events. Limits are presented at 95 % confidence level on gluino and top squark production, for over 13 orders of magnitude in the mean proper lifetime of the stopped particle. Assuming a cloud model of R-hadron interactions, a gluino with mass 1000 GeV and a top squark with mass 525 GeV are excluded, for lifetimes between 1 \u00b5s and 1000 s. These results are the most stringent constraints on stopped particles to date.",

At the CERN LHC the two general-purpose detectors, ATLAS and CMS, have already set stringent limits on the existence of such particles with searches that exploit the anomalously large ionization and/or long time-of-flight that they would exhibit as they traverse the detectors [7,8]. These searches are complemented by those that target the fraction of such particles produced with sufficiently low kinetic energy (KE) that they come to rest in the detectors. In this approach, the subsequent decay is directly observed, allowing (in principle) the reconstruction of the \"stopped\" particle and the study of its characteristics [9].",

These R-hadrons would then traverse the volume of the detector, interacting with detector materials via nuclear interactions and, if charged, by ionization. Below a critical velocity 0.45c, the KE of the R-hadron is small enough and the energy loss per unit length (dE/dx) large enough that the particle can come to rest within the body of the detector. At some later time, the stopped R-hadron would then decay. Assuming at least one daughter particle is a SM particle and the R-hadron has stopped in an instrumented region of the detector, the decay could be observable. If this stopping location is in the calorimeter, as is most likely given its density, the experimental signature would be a randomlytimed, relatively large energy response spread over a few channels. Since these depositions might be difficult to differentiate from those of SM particles produced in pp collisions, they would be most easily observed at times between pp collisions. During these times the detector should be quiet with the exception of cosmic rays, some beam-related backgrounds, and instrumental noise. The results of such searches have previously been reported by the D0 collaboration at the Tevatron [13], and by the CMS [14,15] and ATLAS collaborations [16,17].",

Within the superconducting solenoid volume are a silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL), and a brass/scintillator hadron calorimeter (HCAL), each composed of a central (barrel) and two forward (endcap) sections. In the region |\u03b7| < 1.74, the HCAL cells have widths of 0.087 in pseudorapidity and 0.087 in azimuth (\u03c6). In the \u03b7 \u2212 \u03c6 plane, and for |\u03b7| < 1.48, the HCAL cells map onto 5 \u00d7 5 ECAL crystals arrays to form calorimeter towers projecting radially outwards from close to the nominal interaction point. At larger values of |\u03b7|, the size of the towers increases and the matching ECAL arrays contain fewer crystals. Within each tower, the energy deposits in ECAL and HCAL cells are summed to define the calorimeter tower energies, subsequently used to provide the energies and directions of hadronic jets. Muons are measured in gas-ionization detectors embedded in the steel flux-return yoke outside the solenoid; drift tubes and resistive-plate chambers (RPC) provide coverage in the barrel, while cathode strip chambers (CSC) and RPC provide coverage in the endcaps. Extensive forward calorimetry complements the coverage provided by the barrel and endcap detectors. The first level (L1) of the CMS trigger system, composed of custom hardware processors, uses information from the calorimeters and muon detectors to select the most interesting events in a fixed time interval of less than 4 \u03bcs. The high-level trigger (HLT) processor farm further decreases the event rate from around 100 kHz to around 400 Hz, before data storage. A more detailed description of the CMS detector, together with a definition of the coordinate system used and the relevant kinematic variables, can be found in Ref. [18].",

The probability for the subsequent decay of a stopped particle to occur at a time when the trigger is live is estimated with a custom third stage pseudo-experiment MC simulation.

In 2012, however, the LHC operated with a 50 ns minimum interval between proton bunches and the most often used LHC filling scheme had 1377 of such intervals containing colliding bunches of protons. This search looks for events in a suitable subset of the other 802 BXs i.e. during intervals that are \"out-of-time\" with respect to normal collisions. Such events are recorded using an updated version of the calorimeter trigger employed in the earlier CMS study [14,15] that uses the two beam position and timing monitors (BPTX) that are positioned along the beam axis, at either end of the CMS detector close to the beams. These BPTX are sensitive electrostatic instruments that are able to detect the passage of an LHC proton bunch. Consequently, in order to search for out-of-time events, we employ a dedicated trigger that requires an energy deposit in the calorimeter trigger together with the condition that neither BPTX detects a bunch in that BX. We also require that at most one BPTX produces a signal in a window \u00b11 BX around the triggered event. This rejects triggers due to out of time \"satellite\" bunches that occasionally accompany the colliding protons. The energy deposition in the calorimeter of a jet from the R-hadron decay is sufficiently similar to those of jets originating directly from pp collisions that a calorimeter jet trigger can be used. At L1 the jet transverse energy, which is calculated assuming the jet was produced at the nominal interaction point, is required to be greater than 32 GeV, while in the HLT jet energy is required to be greater than 50 GeV. At both L1 and HLT |\u03b7 jet | is required to be less than 3.0. Finally, the trigger rejects any event within a \u00b11 BX window that is identified as beam halo at L1 by the presence of a pair of CSC hits geometrically consistent with the expected trajectory of a halo muon.",

Halo muons are produced when off-orbit protons in the LHC beam strike material in some limiting aperture of the LHC upstream of the CMS detector. The resulting collision produces a shower of particles, most of which decay before reaching CMS. Muons are produced in these decays and, given their long lifetimes and the fact that they undergo only electroweak interactions, can survive long enough to traverse the detector. When they pass through the denser regions, they can emit a bremsstrahlung photon that strikes the calorimeter and can be reconstructed with large enough energy to be included in the search sample. We remove these events by vetoing any event in which there are hits recorded within the CSC forward muon chambers. The low-noise rate of the CSC detectors allows the requirement to be set at the single-hit level, which enables the maximal exclusion of this background.",

Similar to the halo background, cosmic ray muons may emit a photon that strikes the calorimeter, leaving a large energy deposit. To remove such events, we consider the distribution of reconstructed hits within the barrel muon system. Compared to the expected signal, there are key differences with cosmic ray muons that can be exploited. It is possible that heavy Rhadron decay products have a large enough energy to \"punch through\" the outer region of the calorimeter and the first layers of the iron yoke of the solenoid, leaving energy deposits in the muon system. This phenomenon is easily distinguished from cosmic ray muons by considering the distribution of reconstructed hits. In the case of cosmic ray muons, we expect hits evenly distributed throughout the barrel of the muon system, whereas for signal events, we expect the hits to be restricted to the innermost layers of the muon system. Additionally, in the case of punch-through, the muon hits should be localized near the reconstructed jet. Unlike signal events, hits from cosmic ray muons may also appear opposite in \u03c6 to that of the reconstructed jet. Exploiting these properties, we are able to substantially reduce the cosmic ray background contaminating the signal region by removing events with hits in the outer layers of the muon system (r > 560 cm), events with hits recorded in both the top and bottom of the muon system, and events with hits in the muon system separated from the leading jet in \u03c6 by greater than 1.0 radians.",

            "text": "The final source of background stems from instrumental noise in the calorimetry system, primarily within the HCAL. Noise in the HCAL can give rise to events in which an errant spike in energy is recorded, unrelated to any physical interaction with particles produced inside the detector. These occurrences are rare, but the calorimeter response resembles the anticipated signal and must be removed. The HCAL electronics has a well-defined time response to charge deposits generated by showering particles. Analog signal pulses produced by the electronics are sampled at 40 MHz, synchronized with the LHC clock. These pulses are readout over ten BX samples centered around the pulse maximum. A physical signal exhibits a clear peak followed by an exponential decay over the next few BXs. Moreover, energy deposits from physical particles tend to have a large fraction of the pulse energy in the peak BX. We use a series of offline criteria that exploit these timing and topological characteristics to remove spurious events due to noise, which do not exhibit these properties. These criteria are detailed in Ref. [15] and are applied as in that analysis with the exception of the requirement that the leading jet has at least 60 % of its energy contained in fewer than 6 towers. Using the first stage of the MC simulation described in Sect. 3, we estimate the probability of an R-hadron to stop within the instrumented regions of the detector. In particular, we are interested in R-hadrons that stop in the barrel region of the calorimeter, since these are the regions where we can observe the subsequent jet-like energy deposits from the decay products. We exclude the endcap calorimeters since the signal-to-background ratio is less favorable in this region. R-hadrons could also stop within the iron yokes interleaved with the muon detector system, but we expect a negligible efficiency to detect the corresponding decays. The simulation demonstrates that the stopping probability is approximately constant over the range of R-hadron masses considered in this search. The probability that at least one R-hadron is stopped within the barrel region of the calorimeter is found to be 8 % for gluinos with m g = 800 GeV and 6 % for top squarks with m t = 400 GeV. The slighter larger \u03b5 stopping obtained for gluinos is because of their greater propensity to form doubly charged states. For the particles that stop and then decay within the calorimeter, MC simulations estimate an approximate trigger efficiency of 70 %. We define \u03b5 reco as the number of signal events that pass all selection criteria (including the trigger requirement) divided by the number of signal events that stop within the barrel region of the calorimeter. The reconstruction efficiency depends principally on the energy of the visible daughter particle of the R-hadron decay, which we denote by E g (E t ) if the daughter is a gluon (top quark). The reconstruction efficiencies obtained for gluinos and top squarks are plotted as a function of this energy in Fig. 1. Above the minimum energy threshold for the SM decay products, where \u03b5 reco becomes approximately constant, E g > 120 GeV (E t > 150 GeV), we obtain \u03b5 reco \u2248 45 % (32 %) for g( t)",

Escaping detection is uncommon, but owing to the high rate of halo production in the 2012 data collection period, the expected halo background is non-negligible.

Because of timing and trigger effects, we may only observe the outgoing leg of the halo muon, with the incoming leg recorded in a previous BX. When the reverse occurs, we see only the incoming leg. Additionally, it is possible for the muon to lose all of its energy within the CMS detector before reaching the opposite side CSC chambers, which also results in an incoming-only event. We classify these events as to whether the halo originates from the clockwise or counterclockwise beam, and bin them by their geometric location in the endcap muon system. After integrating these distributions, we measure a halo veto inefficiency of 1 \u00d7 10 \u22125 .

After requiring a substantial energy deposit in the calorimeter and the absence of any hits in the muon endcap system that would cause the event to be classified as a halo muon, we estimate the inefficiency of the cosmic muon veto by dividing the number of events that escape this veto by the total number of events. The inefficiency obtained in this manner is roughly 0.5 %. After multiplication by the number of cosmic ray muon events vetoed from the search sample, this corresponds to a predicted cosmic background of 5.2 \u00b1 2.5 events, where the uncertainty in the estimate is owing to the limited size of the data samples used. Finally, the background owing to instrumental noise is estimated by considering data recorded in 2010. Figure 2 shows the measured noise rates in both periods. In these plots all selection criteria except those that are designed to reject noise are applied. Additionally, only events at least 5 BX from a bunch are considered. This is done to reduce halo contamination in the distributions, which is abundant directly after a bunch crossing. There is a greater variation in the 2012 noise rate because of increased halo background, which can mimic HCAL noise if no CSC hits are present. The small variation seen in the 2012 data, while larger than that seen in 2010, is nevertheless small compared to the systematic uncertainty in the noise event count. The larger variations observed in the 2012 data are attributed to residual halo contamination arising from non-standard LHC beam conditions.",

There is a 2.5 % uncertainty in the integrated luminosity [31]. There is a 13 % uncertainty in the reconstruction efficiency resulting from the possibility that even above the minimum value of E g (E t ), this efficiency is not completely independent of the energy of the daughter particle as is assumed. This uncertainty is determined by considering the difference between the individual values of \u03b5 reco in Fig. 1 and the average value for all points above the minimum value of E g (E t ). The shaded bands in the figure depict this uncertainty. Because the energy deposits resulting in reconstructed jets are not the result of jets originating from the center of the detector (as is the case for jets originating from pp collisions), they are not necessarily directed radially, and standard uncertainties in the jet energy scale (JES) do not apply. Instead, we determine the JES uncertainty by referencing a study performed on the HCAL during cosmic ray data taking in 2008 [32]. This study compares the reconstructed energy deposits in the HCAL for simulated cosmic ray events and cosmic ray events in 2008 data. These comparisons lead to an estimated uncertainty of \u223c2 % on the simulation. A similar study comparing data and simulation for dijets originating at the interaction point conducted with 2012 data yielded an uncertainty of <2 % for jets striking the HCAL barrel with angles of incidence from 0 \u2022 to 60 \u2022 [33]. While the study demonstrates that the HCAL response is well simulated with an uncertainty of about 1 %, we take a conservative JES uncertainty of 3 % to compensate for any effects of stopped particle decays that these studies cannot test because of the potentially large angles that could sometimes be expected in the signal decays. This value for the JES uncertainty leads to an uncertainty in the search results of about 2 % at the minimum value of E g . The value of 3 % is somewhat pessimistic since the uncertainty falls rapidly as E g increases. Variations in the reconstructed jet energy are only important for deposits with energies close to the jet energy threshold, which typically correspond to events in which E g is small.",

These limits are valid for the minimum value of E g and E t that we calculate from the turn-on curves shown in Fig. 5. These minimum values are listed in Table 5 for each threshold; they increase with increased E thresh because the turn on plateau for \u03b5 reco moves in response to the higher thresholds as seen in Fig. 5. The systematic uncertainties in \u03b5 reco and integrated luminosity are unaffected by the increase in the jet energy threshold. However, the systematic uncertainty resulting from the JES does vary somewhat with different E thresh . The final JES uncertainty is calculated by measuring the change in \u03b5 reco when the jet energy threshold requirement is varied according to the JES systematic uncertainty. Variations in the jet energy requirement have the largest impact for gluon (top) energies close to the threshold, so we perform this calculation on simulated signal samples corresponding to the minimum values of E g (E t ).",
