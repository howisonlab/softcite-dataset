            "text": "The LHC's discovery of the 125 GeV Higgs boson [1,2] completed the particle spectrum of the Standard Model (SM) and proved the general idea that the electroweak symmetry was broken by some Higgs field condensed in the vacuum. However the SM does not explain why the Higgs condensate formed. To reveal this fundamental question new physics describing new phenomena is necessary. And the new physics could manifest itself as anomalies not only in the strengths but also in Lorentz structures of the couplings between the Higgs boson and vector bosons VV H (V = Z, \u03b3 and W ) [3]. This paper studies the measurement of such anomalies in ZZH couplings, which relate to the electroweak symmetry breaking directly. The study was performed with the simulation framework of the International Large Detector (ILD) concept [4] for the International Linear Collider (ILC) [5], and the Lorentz structures of the ZZH couplings are based on an effective Lagrangian from the Effective Field Theory (EFT) [6]:",

Sensitivities in H20 scenario to the anomalous couplings b Z andb Z with the new Lorentz structures can reach < 1 %, and the sensitivity to the anomalous coupling a Z can reach a few %. This would be very useful to probe the new physics beyond the SM. Once the anomalous ZZH couplings is assumed, anomalous \u03b3ZH couplings must be considered since Z and \u03b3 are mixing with each other through the electroweak symmetry.

Black lines on the upper middle and right plot correspond to \u2206\u03c7 2 = 1 bounds. \u221a s = 250 GeV with the integrated luminosity of 250 fb \u22121 is assumed. Three channels (Z \u2192 \u00b5 \u00b5, ee and ZH \u2192 qqbb) of the ZH and one channel (H \u2192 bb) of the ZZ processes are considered as the shape information.",
