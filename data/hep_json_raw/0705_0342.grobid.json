            "text": "The \u03a5(5S) was discovered about 20 years ago in e + e \u2212 collisions at CLEO [1] and CUSB [2]. Its mass is (10865 \u00b1 8) MeV, about 300 MeV higher than the \u03a5(4S) resonance, and its width of (110 \u00b1 13) MeV is about five times larger than the \u03a5(4S) resonance. Its production cross-section was measured to be about 0.3 nb, about ten times lower than the \u03a5(4S) cross-section. Owing to its mass, the \u03a5(5S) can decay to a variety of final states containing B and B 0 s mesons. The accessible B-meson final states include: BB, B * B , B * B * , BB\u03c0, B * B \u03c0, B * B * \u03c0 and BB\u03c0\u03c0; final states with B 0 s are: s . Further study of the \u03a5(5S) is of great interest because of it being a potentially large source of B 0 s mesons at an e + e \u2212 machine. If suitably large samples can be collected, their study would provide a complementary probe of CP violation and rare decays to LHCb. Studies involving rare decays, particularly those with soft photons, and untagged time-dependent and timeindependent measurements, which provide access to the width difference between the B 0 s mass eigenstates, \u2206\u0393 s , offer complementary information to measurements at hadron machines [3]. Because of the small Lorentz boost at the \u03a5(5S) and the large value of the mixing frequency, \u2206m s [4], time-dependent CP violation measurements in mixing are not possible.",

Several models attempt to describe the hadronic cross-section in the 10-11 GeV region. The simplest model, the quark-pair creation model (QPC) [5], allows for quark pairs to be 'popped' out of the vacuum. This model by itself is insufficient to describe the hadronic cross-section. Ono et al. [7] are able to reproduce the spectrum by introducing a bbg hybrid at 10683 MeV (the QHM model). A third model, the unitarized quark model (UQM) [6] includes coupled channel effects between bb states via real (two-meson) intermediate states. The QHM predicts B * B is dominant at 10865 MeV, with relative rates of B * B * :B * B :BB \u223c 1:3:6. On the other hand, the UQM also reproduces the hadronic crosssection, but predicts that B * B * is dominant, e.g., B * B * :B * B :BB \u223c 2:1:0.3.",

Using this cross-section and the measured total hadronic cross-section, the B 0 s fraction in \u03a5(5S) decays, f s , is computed to be f s = 1 \u2212 (\u03c3 BBX /\u03c3 had ) = (0.41 \u00b1 0.10 \u00b1 0.09). To determine the contributing subprocesses, events are selected in the expected signal band in the \u2206E \u2212 m bc plane and projected onto the m bc axis. The resulting distribution of events is shown in Fig. 1. A dominant B * B * peak is observed, along with a smaller contribution from B * B , and an insignificant yield from BB. The distributions are fit to the sum of 3 Gaussians, with resolutions determined from MC and the mass difference between the B * B * and BB peaks constrained to the expected value of 47.5 MeV. The fitted yields are 3.7 +3.1 \u22122.4 BB, 10.3 \u00b1 3.9 B * B and 31.4 \u00b1 6.1 B * B * events. Insignificant yields in B ( * )B( * ) \u03c0 and BB\u03c0\u03c0 lead to 90% confidence level upper limits of 13.1 and 6.4 events, respectively. Thus, it is found that (74\u00b115\u00b18)% of the B production is through B * B * and (24 \u00b1 9 \u00b1 3) is from B * B . For BB, B ( * )B( * ) \u03c0 and BB\u03c0\u03c0 90% upper limits of 22%, 32% and 14%, respectively, are obtained. These results strongly disfavor the QHM and are consistent with the UQM.",

We also find a dominance of B * B * among ordinary B decays. Both of these observations are consistent with the UQM and inconsistent with the QHM. An e + e \u2212 machine operating at the \u03a5(5S) produces about 15 million B 0 s per 100 fb \u22121 .

In the Standard Model, the width difference, \u2206\u0393 CP s between the CP eigenstates, B odd s and B even s is given by \u2206\u0393 CP s = 2|\u0393 12 |, where \u0393 12 is the off-diagonal matrix element in the B 0 s decay matrix, which connects B 0 s andB 0 s via onshell intermediate states. These matrix elements are saturated by tree-diagrams, such as B 0 be insensitive to new physics. Because there are more CP even than CP odd final states in B 0 s decays, one expects \u2206\u0393 CP s \u2243 (0.12 \u00b1 0.06)[3]. In the presence of CP violation, one finds a width difference between the mass eigenstates of \u2206\u0393 s = \u2206\u0393 CP s cos \u03c6, where \u03c6 = arg(\u2212M 12 /\u0393 12 ), is the difference between the B 0 s mixing phase and the phase of \u2212\u0393 12 . In the Standard Model, \u03c6 is expected to be small, of order 0.01. Therefore, one expects \u2206\u0393 CP s \u2243 \u2206\u0393 s . Since new physics could affect B 0 s mixing, i.e., the phase of M 12 , new physics could drive \u2206\u0393 s away from \u2206\u0393 CP s . Precise measurements of \u2206\u0393 CP s can be obtained by measuring the branching fractions and CP content of final states accessible to B 0 s andB 0 s . Such final states are dominated by D +( * ) s D \u2212( * ) s, but also include J/\u03c8\u03c6, J/\u03c8\u03b7 J/\u03c8\u03b7 \u2032 , etc. Under certain assumptions[3], it can be shown that B 0 even, and neglecting the charmonium states, one finds \u2206\u0393 CP s /\u0393 s \u2243 2B",
