The large mass of the top quark gives rise to large radiative corrections, for example to the W propagator, which causes a strong correlation between m W , m t , and the Higgs boson mass m H . To predict m H a precise measurement of m t is crucial. The large mass leads also to a very short lifetime of the top quark, \u03c4 t \u2243 0.5 \u2022 10 \u221224 s, such that top hadrons are not formed. The top quark thus offers the unique possibility to study a quasi-free quark and as a consequence polarization effects are accessible in the angular distributions of top-quark decay products. Since m t is close to the energy scale at which the electroweak gauge symmetry breaks down (vacuum expectation value of the Higgs field v = 246 GeV), it has been argued that the top quark may be part of a special dynamics causing the break down of the electroweak gauge symmetry 2 . Finally, the top quark gives access to the highest energy scales and offers thereby the chance to find new, unexpected physics, for example heavy resonances that decay into tt pairs.",

The most important (or golden) channel is the so-called lepton+jets channel where one W boson decays leptonically into a charged lepton (electron or muon) plus a neutrino, while the second W boson decays into jets. The lepton+jets channel features a large branching ratio of about 29%, manageable backgrounds, and allows for the full reconstruction of the event kinematics. Other accessible channels are the dilepton channel, in which both W bosons decay to leptons, and the all-hadronic channel, where both W bosons decay hadronically. The dilepton channel has the advantage of having a low background, but suffers on the other hand from a lower branching fraction (5%) compared to the lepton+jets channel. The all-hadronic channel, on the contrary, has the largest branching ratio of all tt event categories (46%), but has the drawback of a huge QCD multijet background, that has to be controlled experimentally. The different categories of tt and their branching fractions are summarized in Table 1. ",

Two jets originate from b-quarks. Typical selection cuts ask for a charged lepton with p T > 20 GeV/c, E T / > 20 GeV, and at least four jets with E T > 20 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.0, one of them identified as a b-quark jet. The most commonly used algorithm to identify b-quark jets is based on the reconstruction of secondary vertices in jets, exploiting the relatively long lifetime of b-hadrons and a large Lorentz boost. The typical decay length of b-hadrons in high-p T b-quark jets is on the order of a few millimeters. The requirement of a secondary vertex within one of the jets leads to a large reduction of the W +jets background by roughly a factor of 50, while the selection efficiency for tt events is about 50% to 60%. In Run I and Run II several analyses used secondary vertex b-jet tagging to enrich the tt signal in the lepton+jets channel 3,4,5,6 . Alternative methods identify b-quark jets by relying on the impact parameter significance of tracks associated to jets 7,8 , or by reconstructing leptons originating from semileptonic decays of b hadrons 9,10 . Advanced b-jet taggers combine all available information using neural networks 11,12 . The most recent CDF analysis based on secondary vertex b tagging 13 is a counting experiment in which the background rate is estimated using a combination of simulated events and data driven methods. The signal region is defined as the data set with a leptonic W candidate plus \u2265 3 jets. To further suppress background, a cut on the sum of all transverse energies H T > 230 GeV is applied. The jet multiplicity distribution of the W +jets data set observed by this CDF analysis is shown in Figure 2. The uncertainty on the luminosity measurement is reduced by measuring the ratio of tt-to-Z-boson cross sections and the measured cross section is found to be 7.32 \u00b1 0.36 (stat) \u00b1 0.59(syst) \u00b1 0.14 (Z theory) pb, assuming m t = 172.5 GeV/c 2 . The cross section of tt production and Z/\u03b3 * \u2192 \u2113 + \u2113\u2212 production are measured in data samples corresponding to the same integrated luminosity. By forming the ratio of both measured cross sections and multiplying by the well-known theoretical Z/\u03b3 * \u2192 \u2113 + \u2113\u2212 cross section the luminosity uncertainty of 6% is effectively removed and replaced by the uncertainty on the Z/\u03b3 * cross section of 2%.",

However, the technique is also associated to systematic uncertainties which become relevant when the data statistics increases. The uncertainties are associated to the efficiencies to identify b-quark jets, but also to the efficiencies to wrongly identify c-quark jets and light-quark jets as b jets. An additional uncertainty arises from the flavor composition of the W +jets data set before applying the tagging algorithm. At CDF, the fraction of heavy-flavor jets is found to be higher in collision data than predicted by the Monte Carlo generator Alpgen 14 when studying the W +1 jets data set using a neural-network-based flavor separating tool 15,16,17 . As a result, the fraction of W bb and W cc is scaled up by a common factor of 1.4 \u00b1 0.4. The large uncertainty is assigned to cover the results of studies in higher jet-multiplicity samples and the results obtained by investigating other flavor-separating variables.",

Given the limited energy resolution of jets the reconstruction of the tt kinematics is also very demanding. The cross section measurements in the all-hadronic channel therefore exploit in most cases topological or event shape information to discern signal from background. The observation of tt events in the all-hadronic channel dates back to Run I of the Tevatron 33,34 . While CDF used b-quark jet identification to suppress background, the D\u00d8 analyses employed a neural network to combine several kinematic variables to one discriminant that separates QCD multijet background from tt events. In Run II, CDF first published an analysis combining b-quark jet identification with cuts on several topological variables 35 , but replaced these cuts in an updated measurement by a kinematical selection using a neural network 36 . The latest measurement in this series 37 added input variables to the neural network that discriminate between quark-initiated and gluon-initiated jets. As an another novelty the analysis applied techniques used for the measurement of m t , namely the simultaneous determination of the top-quark mass m t , the jet energy scale, and the number of signal and background events. After the neural network based event selection the signal yields are obtained by a fit to the reconstructed top-quark mass distribution m rec t and the mass distribution of the W boson candidates.

To measure the fraction of tt pairs originating from a gg initial state, physicists at CDF exploited the fact that gg initial states produce more initialstate radiation than qq initial states. The analysis makes use of the proportionality of the mean number of low-p T tracks in an eventN trk and the gluon content. The linear relation betweenN trk and the average number of hard initial-state gluons is calibrated in W +jets and dijet data samples. Using simulated events, templates of theN trk distribution are calculated for gg \u2192 tt and qq \u2192 tt events. These templates Recently, the CDF collaboration measured the gg-fusion fraction in the tt dilepton channel. The measurement exploits the fact that tt pairs produced via gg fusion are in a different spin state, namely J = 0, J z = 0, than tt pairs produced via qq annihilation (J = 1, J z = \u00b11). The different spin state manifests itself in different azimuthal angular correlations of the charged leptons in tt dilepton events. Based on a data set corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2 fb \u22121 a fit to the distribution of the difference \u2206\u03c6 of the azimuthal angles of the charged leptons yields a gg-fusion fraction of f gg = 0.53 +0.36 \u22120.38",

In the top sector in particular FCNC are strongly suppressed with branching ratios of O \u2248 10 \u221214 . The CDF collaboration has searched for non-SM top quark decays of the type tt \u2192 ZqW \u2212b \u2192 (\u2113 + \u2113 \u2212 q)(qq \u2032b ). Top-antitop candidates are reconstructed in events with four high-p T jets and two isolated leptons using kinematic constraints. Within their experimental resolutions determined from simulated events the reconstructed mass of the hadronically decaying W -boson M qq has to be equal to m W , the mass of the reconstructed hadronic top quark M bqq and the mass of semileptonically de- caying top quark M Zq has to resemble m t . A \u03c7 2 formed from these conditions is used to determine the most likely combination of physics objects and measure its tt-likeness under the anomalous-decay hypothesis. A fit to the \u03c7 2 distribution in combination with a Feldman-Cousins technique is used to derive an upper limit on the branching ratio: BR(t \u2192 Zq) < 3.7% at the 95% C.L. 101 . A previous Run I result by CDF also set a limit on FCNC branching ratios in the photon-plus-jet mode: BR(t \u2192 \u03b3q) < 3.2% 102 .",

Many extensions of the SM include a Higgs sector with two Higgs doublets and are therefore called Two Higgs Doublet Models (THDM). In a THDM electroweak symmetry breaking leads to five physical Higgs bosons: two neutral CP -even scalars h 0 and H 0 , one neutral CP -odd pseudoscalar A 0 , and a pair of charged scalars H \u00b1 . The parameters of the extended Higgs sector include the mass of the charged Higgs M H + and tan \u03b2 = v 1 /v 2 , the ratio of the vacuum expectation values v 1 and v 2 of the two Higgs doublets.

The branching fraction depends on tan \u03b2 and m H + . The MSSM predicts that the channel t \u2192 H + b dominates the top-quark decay for tan \u03b2 70. In most analyses it is assumed that BR(t \u2192 W + b) + BR(t \u2192 H + b) = 1. In the parameter region tan \u03b2 < 1 the dominant decay mode is H + \u2192 cs, while for tan \u03b2 > 1 the decay channel H + \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03bd \u03c4 is the most important one. For tan \u03b2 > 5 the branching fraction to \u03c4 + \u03bd \u03c4 is nearly 100%.

The UA1 and UA2 experiments at the CERN SppS excluded certain regions of the m t versus m H \u00b1 plane 103,104 . In Run I of the Tevatron, CDF and D\u00d8 improved these limits using events with a dilepton signature 105 or reconstructing tau leptons in their hadronic decay mode 106,107,108,109,110 , which is experimentally a very challenging task at a hadron collider. In Tevatron Run II, CDF has added a direct search for a charged Higgs boson in the decay channel H + \u2192 cs using the dijet invariant mass as a discriminant 111 . In a reanalysis of the tt candidate samples used for cross section measurements CDF also considered the decay modes H + \u2192 t * b and H + \u2192 W + h 0 with h 0 \u2192 bb 112 . The D\u00d8 collaboration has recently performed direct searches in the lepton+jets 113 and dilepton channels 114 , but has also done a simultaneous measurement of the tt cross section in the lepton+jets, the dilepton and the \u03c4 +lepton channel, deriving in parallel limits on top-quark decays to a charged Higgs boson 44 . So far, there is no evidence for t \u2192 H + b decays.

Many interesting analyses have searched for physics beyond the SM, for example for resonances decaying into tt pairs. The measured forward-backward asymmetry in tt production shows an intriguing excess which will come under closer scrutiny once more data will be analysed. The measurements of top-quark decay show impressive progress, for example the measurement of the W -helicity fractions in top decay. ",

In both cases the W + couples solely to b quarks of left-handed chirality, which translates into left-handed helicity, since the b quark is effectively massless compared to the energy scale set by m t . If the b quark is emitted antiparallel to the top-quark spin axis, the W + must be longitudinally polarized, h W = 0, to conserve angular momentum. If the b quark is emitted parallel to the top-quark spin axis, the W + boson has helicity h W = \u22121 and is transversely polarized.
