The Collins asymmetry of the proton was extracted in the Bjorken x range 0.003 < x < 0.7. These new measurements confirm with higher accuracy previous measurements from the COMPASS and HERMES collaborations, which exhibit a definite effect in the valence quark region. The asymmetries for negative and positive hadrons are similar in magnitude and opposite in sign. They are compatible with model calculations in which the u-quark transversity is opposite in sign and somewhat larger than the d-quark transversity distribution function. The asymmetry is extracted as a function of Bjorken x, the relative hadron energy z and the hadron transverse momentum p h T . The high statistics and quality of the data also allow for more detailed investigations of the dependence on the kinematic variables. These studies confirm the leading-twist nature of the Collins asymmetry.",

            "text": "Deep inelastic lepton-nucleon scattering (DIS) measurements as a tool to unveil the structure of the nucleon started in the late 60's at the Stanford Linear Accelerator (SLAC), when for the first time a high energy electron accelerator became available. A wealth of eN scattering data was collected, and eventually it became clear that scattering at large momentum transfer could be interpreted as elastic scattering off the nucleon constituents, the \"partons\". From the dependence of the cross-section on the energy and the momentum transfered to the nucleon it was possible to identify the charged partons with the earlier postulated quarks. In the subsequent years the SLAC energy was gradually increased. Higher energy experiments could be performed at CERN and FNAL using muon beams from \u03c0 and K decays, and at the HERA ep collider. The high beam energies allowed measurements at larger values of Q 2 , the square of the four-momentum transfered to the nucleon, and at smaller values of x, the fraction of the nucleon momentum carried by the parton. All these data in combination with the neutrino-nucleon data eventually allowed the extraction of the nucleon parton distribution functions (PDFs) and their Q 2 dependence, in particular of the functions q(x, Q 2 ) (or f q 1 (x, Q 2 )), which describe the number density of quarks of flavour q.",

The goal of these experiments was the measurement of the helicity distributions \u2206q(x) (or g q 1 (x)), defined as difference between the number densities of quarks of flavor q with helicity equal or opposite to that of the nucleon, for a nucleon polarised along its direction of motion (longitudinal polarisation). Following the discovery by the EMC at CERN in 1988 that the quark spins contribute only little to the proton spin, the interest in the nucleon spin structure was revived. In the past decade, a third generation of experiments at CERN (COMPASS), DESY (HERMES) and JLab began to study the nucleon spin structure using semi-inclusive DIS (SIDIS) processes, in particular the gluon contribution to the nucleon spin. These experiments also use polarised beams and polarised targets, while additionally hadrons produced by fragmentation of the struck quark are reconstructed and identified.",

For a given quark flavour q, \u2206 T q(x) is the analog of the helicity distribution in the case of a transversely polarised nucleon. Helicity and transversity distributions coincide in the non-relativistic quark model but they are expected to be different when relativistic effects are taken into account. As there exists no gluon transversity distribution, the Q 2 evolution of \u2206 T q(x) is quite different from that of \u2206q(x). The first moment of the valence quark transversity distribution is related to the tensor charge \u03b4 q,",

In those data no size-able Collins asymmetry was observed within the accuracy of the measurements [10][11][12], a fact that was understood in terms of a cancellation between the u-and d-quark contributions [11]. The COMPASS data are still today the only SIDIS data ever taken on a transversely polarised deuteron target and provide constraints on the d-quark contribution 1 . Together with the HERMES and Belle data they allowed for the first global analyses and first extractions [14,15] of the transversity distributions for u-and d-quarks and of favoured and unfavoured Collins FFs. It is important to note that global analyses of e + e \u2212 \u2192 hadrons and SIDIS data are a necessity, since neither can the Collins FF be extracted from e + e \u2212 data alone, nor can the Collins and transversity functions be disentangled using only SIDIS data. Similar considerations hold for the transverse spin asymmetry in hadron pair production in DIS [16], where a signal on the proton was recently measured by HER-MES [17] and COMPASS [18]. In this case the transversity distribution is coupled with the di-hadron FF which was recently accessed [19] using the Belle data.",

The differences between these physical asymmetries and the false asymmetries are used to quantify the overall systematic point-to-point uncertainties, which are evaluated to be 0.5 times the statistical uncertainties.

No correlations are expected a priori, since these azimuthal modulations are independent, but in the COMPASS experiment they arise mostly because the coverage in the horizontal plane of the muon triggering system is not complete. Figure 2 shows the correlation coefficients between the Collins and Sivers asymmetries as a function of x, z and p h T , as given by the UML estimator. As can be seen, they are always smaller than 0.15. This correlation regards only the statistical fluctuations of the observables and is relevant only in case of simultaneous fits to the various asymmetries. Figure 3 shows the Collins asymmetries measured as a function of x, z, and p h T for positive and negative hadrons. The error bars are statistical only. As can be seen in the figure, the Collins asymmetry has a strong x dependence. It is compatible with zero in the small x region accessible at COMPASS and increases up to 0.05 in the valence quark region (x > 0.1), confirming that the transversity PDF is a valence object. The data exhibit a mirror symmetry with respect to the hadron charge, which is interpreted as due to the same size and opposite sign of the favoured and unfavoured Collins FFs [10]. The values are in agreement with our previous measurements [20], with an important gain in statistics: the statistical and the systematic uncertainties are reduced by about a factor of two. In the same figure, the data are compared with the predictions of ref. [27] which were obtained by fitting the HERMES proton data [28], the COMPASS deuteron data [12] and the Belle e + e \u2212 fragmentation data [6].
