            "text": "For a long time there were 3 main experimental indications in favor of the existence of sterile neutrinos:\u03bde appearance in the\u03bd\u00b5 beam in the LSND experiment,\u03bde flux deficit in comparison with theoretical expectations in reactor experiments, and \u03bde deficit in calibration runs with radioactive sources in the Ga solar neutrino experiments SAGE and GALEX. All three problems can be explained by the existence of sterile neutrinos with the mass square difference in the ballpark of 1 eV 2 . Recently the MiniBooNE collaboration observed electron (anti)neutrino appearance in the muon (anti)neutrino beams. The significance of the effect reaches 6.0\u03c3 level when combined with the LSND result. Even more recently the NEUTRINO-4 collaboration claimed the observation of\u03bde oscillations to sterile neutrinos with a significance slightly higher than 3\u03c3. If these results are confirmed, New Physics beyond the Standard Model would be required. More than 10 experiments are devoted to searches of sterile neutrinos. Six very short baseline reactor experiments are taking data just now. We review the present results and perspectives of these experiments.",

            "text": "Oscillations of the three neutrino flavors are well established. Two mass differences and three angles describing such oscillations have been measured [1]. Additional light active neutrinos are excluded by the measurements of the Z boson decay width [2]. Nevertheless, existence of additional sterile neutrinos is not excluded. Moreover, several effects observed with about 3\u03c3 significance level can be explained by active-sterile neutrino oscillations. The GALEX and SAGE Gallium experiments performed calibrations with radioactive sources and reported the ratio of numbers of observed to predicted events of 0.88 \u00b1 0.05 [3]. This deficit is the so called \"Gallium anomaly\" (GA). Mueller et al. [4] made new estimates of the reactor\u03bd e flux which is about 6% higher than experimental measurements at small distances. This deficit is the so called \"Reactor antineutrino anomaly\" (RAA). Both anomalies can be explained by activesterile neutrino oscillations at Very Short Baselines (VSBL) requiring a mass-squared difference of the order of 1 eV 2 [5]. The LSND collaboration reported observation of\u03bd \u00b5 \u2192\u03bd e mixing with the mass-squared difference bigger than \u223c 0.1 eV 2 [6]. The initial results of the MiniBooNE tests of this signal were inconclusive and probably indicated additional effects [7]. However, in May, 2018 the MiniBooNE collaboration presented the 4.7\u03c3 evidence for electron (anti)neutrino appearance in the muon (anti)neutrino beams [8]. The effect significance reaches 6.0\u03c3 when the MiniBooNE and LSND results are combined. The MINIBooNE and LSND data are consistent, however the energy spectrum of the excess does not agree too well with the sterile neutrino explanation.",

            "text": "The best point in the sterile neutrino parameter space corresponds to a very large mixing (sin 2 2\u03b8 = 0.92) and a small mass square difference of \u2206m 2 14 = 0.041eV 2 (see Figure 1). However, this region in the sterile neutrino parameter space is disfavored by other experiments and only a small area with larger mass square differences up to 2 eV 2 and smaller mixing is still allowed by the global fits [9,10].  Very recently the NEUTRINO-4 collaboration claimed the observation of the of\u03bd e oscillations to sterile neutrinos with a significance slightly larger than 3\u03c3 [11]. The measured sterile neutrino parameters are surprisingly large: \u2206m 2 14 = 7.22eV 2 and sin 2 (2\u03b8 14 ) = 0.35. These values are in contradiction with the limits obtained by the reactor\u03bd e flux measurements at larger distances (see, for example [12]). However, these limits depend on the phenomenological predictions of the reactor\u03bd e flux which are model dependent. There are also cosmological constraints on the effective number of neutrinos [2,13]. However, in several theoretical models sterile neutrinos (at least with not too large masses)are still compatible with these constraints. Details can be found in a review of sterile neutrinos [14].",

The detector positions are changed typically 3 times a week. The size of the reactor core is quite big (3.7 m in height and 3.2 m in diameter) which leads to the smearing of the oscillation pattern. This drawback is compensated by a high\u03bd e flux which allows DANSS to detect almost 5 thousand\u03bd e at a distance of 10.7 m. The energy resolution of the DANSS detector is very modest (\u03c3 E /E \u223c 34% at E = 1 MeV). This leads to additional smearing of the oscillation pattern, comparable with the smearing due to the large reactor core size. The DANSS experiment compares the positron energy spectra at the two distances from the reactor core (10.7 m and 12.7 m). The IBD counting rate is not used in the analysis (although it is consistent with the no oscillation hypothesis). This is the most conservative approach which does not depend on the predicted normalization and shape of the reactor\u03bd e spectrum as well as on the detector efficiency.

            "text": "The NEUTRINO-4 detector consists of 50 liquid scintillator sections with a total (fiducial) volume of 1.8(1.42) m 3 [11]. The detector is installed on a movable platform near a very compact (42 \u00d7 42 \u00d7 35 cm 3 ) and powerful (100 MW) SM-3 research reactor at Dmitrovgrad (Russia). The distance to the reactor core is changed frequently (every 10-15 days) which allows to perform measurements in the range from 6 m to 12 m. This is an enormous asset in the control of systematic uncertainties. Unfortunately, the detector is installed almost on the ground surface with the overburden of only 3.5 m of water equivalent. There is also no PSD for the background suppression. This leads to a very modest S/B ratio of 0.54. The energy resolution is also modest (16% at 1 MeV). In order to be independent from the reactor\u03bd e spectrum, NEUTRINO-4 analyses the deviations of the\u03bd e spectrum measured at different distances from the reactor core normalized on the spectrum averaged over all distances. They do not take into account the correlations between data sets but such correlations are not expected to be large. The efficiencies of different sections are assumed to be equal. The importance of this assumption is hard to estimate. It should be noted that measurements at one distance are typically averaged over several sections (with exception of the closest and the furthest distances). This should considerably reduce the influence of possible differences in the efficiency of different sections (apart from the very important closest point). Figure 5 shows the obtained L/E dependence of the IBD rate normalized on the rate averaged over all distances. The data coincide nicely with the theoretical predictions which correspond to sin 2 2\u03b8 14 = 0.35 and \u2206m 2 14 = 7.22 eV 2 . However, the theoretical predictions do not take into account the (modest) energy resolution of the detector. For example, the full width at half maximum of the 5 MeV signal should be about 840 keV which is larger even than the bin width of 500 keV used for the theoretical predictions. The example with the 5 MeV signal was selected because the significance of the oscillation effect relies mainly on the high energy part of the spectrum and the smallest distances. Incorporation of the energy resolution into the theoretical predictions should considerably smear out the oscillation pattern and to reduce the statistical significance of the effect. Figure 6 shows the NEUTRINO-4 results in the sin 2 2\u03b8 14 , \u2206m 2 14 plane. The best point significance is larger than 3\u03c3. The obtained sterile neutrino parameters are in contradiction with the limits obtained by the reactor\u03bd e flux measurements at larger distances (see, for example [12]). However, these limits depend on the phenomenological predictions of the reactor\u03bd e flux which are model dependent. The first results of the PROSPECT experiment [22] are also in tension with the NEUTRINO-4 claim (see the next section) The large \u2206m 2 14 makes the disagreement with the cosmological constrains even more serious [2].

Thin specularly reflecting panels divide the LS volume into an 11\u00d714 two-dimensional array of 154 optically isolated rectangular segments (14.5 cm\u00d714.5 cm\u00d7117.6 cm) read out by two PMT each. The PROSPECT detector is installed at the High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory practically at the earth's surface (less than one meter-water-equivalent of vertical concrete overburden). Nevertheless, a very good PSD and 3D reconstruction of events allowed PROSPECT to achieve a decent S/B ratio of 1.36. A relatively high power of the reactor (85 MW), the large detector (\u223c 4 ton), a small distance from the reactor (6.7 m), and a large detection efficiency allow PROSPECT to collect 771 IBD events per day. In order to be independent from the\u03bd e spectrum, PROSPECT uses ratios of the measured IBD spectra at different baselines to the baseline-integrated measured spectrum. The measured ratios are consistent with the no oscillation hypothesis (flat behavior). This allows to exclude a sizable part of the sterile neutrino parameters (see Figure 7). The obtained limit on the sin 2 2\u03b8 14 at \u2206m 2 14 = 7.2 eV 2 (preferred by the NEUTRINO-4 experiment) is smaller than the NEUTRINO-4 best point.

The red color indicates advantageous parameters while problematic parameters are indicated by the blue color. The experiments DANSS and NEOS at industrial reactors benefit form a high counting rate up to 5000\u03bd e /day. They have the highest sensitivity at \u2206m 2 14 = (1-2) eV 2 . The sensitivity reaches regions with sin 2 2\u03b8 14 < 0.01. However, at larger \u2206m 2 14 oscillations are averaged out already inside the large reactor core and the sensitivity deteriorates. Here the experiments at the research reactors in particular PROSPECT and modernized NEUTRINO-4 have a higher sensitivity. A compilation of sensitivities of several experiments can be found in [9]. The current generation of VSBL reactor experiments will soon test the NEUTRINO-4 claim of the observation of\u03bd e oscillations to sterile neutrinos. If confirmed this result would require New Physics beyond the Standard Model. The comparison of the strong limits on muon (anti)neutrino disappearance with the limits on\u03bd e disappearance strongly disfavors the possibility to simultaneously explain the LSND/MiniBooNE excess in the (\u03bd e )\u03bd e appearance and RAA/GA deficit by sterile neutrinos [9,10]. However, the NEUTRINO-4 result was not included into these global fits. Forthcoming results from the running VSBL reactor experiment will soon clarify the situation. ",
