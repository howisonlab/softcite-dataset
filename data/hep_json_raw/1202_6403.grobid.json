A modulation of this signal is observed with a period of (366\u00b13) days and a relative amplitude of (1.29 \u00b1 0.07)%. The measured phase is (179 \u00b1 6) days, corresponding to a maximum on the 28 th of June. Using the most complete atmospheric data models available, muon rate fluctuations are shown to be positively correlated with atmospheric temperature, with an effective coefficient \u03b1 T = 0.93 \u00b1 0.04. This result represents the most precise study of the muon flux modulation for this site and is in good agreement with expectations.",

            "text": "Muons observed in underground sites arise mostly from the decay of pions and kaons produced by the interaction of primary cosmic rays with the nuclei of the upper atmosphere [1]. Since muons lose energy as they penetrate the Earth, low-energy muons are stopped and only the most energetic muons can be observed in underground detectors, with an energy threshold, E thr , depending on the depth. The flux of cosmic muons detected deep underground shows time variations which are, at first approximation, seasonal. These variations can be related to the air density fluctuations, which affect the fraction of mesons decaying to muons energetic enough to reach the underground detector. This effect has been known and studied for many decades [2]. Underground experiments have observed this phenomenon at Gran Sasso (MACRO [3], LVD [4]) and in other underground sites ( [5], [6] and refs. therein).",

We demonstrate such a correlation for the case of Borexino in section 8.

The integral extends over atmospheric depth from the altitude of muon production to the ground. The atmosphere can be described by many layers with a continuos distribution of temperature and pressure. A possible parametrization ( [6] and with more details [19]) considers the atmosphere as an isothermal body with an effective temperature, T eff , obtained from a weighted average over atmospheric depth:  where the approximation may be done considering that the temperature is measured at discrete atmospheric levels, X n . Figure 4 shows the temperature in the atmosphere for the LNGS site and the weight function, W , as functions of the pressure levels. As can be seen, the higher layers of the atmosphere are given higher weights, as it is in these layers that most of the muons energetic enough to reach underground sites are produced. Muons produced at a lower altitude will be on average less energetic and a larger fraction of them will lie below threshold (E thr ). We may also define the \"effective temperature coefficient\", \u03b1 T , which quantifies the correlation effect that is discussed in section 8:",

In our case, the precise coordinates of the LNGS underground halls have been used: 13.5333 \u2022 E, 42.4275 \u2022 N. Atmospheric temperature is provided by the model at 37 discrete pressure levels in the [1-1000] hPa range (1 hPa = 1.019 g/cm 2 ), four times a day at 00.00 h, 06.00 h, 12.00 h, and 18.00 h 1 . Based on this data set, T eff was calculated using eq. 5.2 four times a day. The four results were then averaged, and the variance of the four values was used to estimate the uncertainty in the mean. Figure 2 (lower panel) shows the daily values of T eff for the four year period considered. A simple average gives T 0 eff = 220.99 K, while the fit with a function analogous to eq. 4.1 returns T 0 eff = (221.153 \u00b1 0.007) K, amplitude (2.98 \u00b1 0.01) K corresponding to 1.35 %, period (369.2 \u00b1 0.2) days and phase (174.0 \u00b1 0.4) days. These are very similar to the corresponding fit results of the muon flux data set, discussed in section 4. The \u03c7 2 /NDF = 46010/1457 confirms that the sinusoidal behavior is only a first order approximation. Aside from small scale fluctuations, additional winter maxima can be observed which can be ascribed to the known meteorological phenomenon of the Sudden Stratospheric Warmings (SSW [21]) and whose effect is sometimes comparable in amplitude with the underlying seasonal modulation. In order to disentangle the seasonal dependence from sub-leading effects, the method of Lomb-Scargle has been used.",

(7.2), the result is independent of the modulation phase as long as the modulation period is shorter than the overall measurement time. Figure 5 shows an LS periodogram of the four-year muon data acquired in Borexino. The LS power, P , of a given modulation is primarily a function of its amplitude, A. Statistical fluctuations of the bin content will alter both the maximum, P , generated by white noise and the exact value observed for the actual modulation. To assess the significance of a modulation discovery, it is therefore necessary to know the statistical fluctuations of both the white noise level and the signal height. Using the known detector live time distribution and muon rate, we have performed realistic Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of muon sample time distributions. In a first step, 10 4 MC data samples with a constant muon rate have been simulated. From the corresponding P spectra we can estimate the probability that an apparent periodic modulation appears as a result of white noise. For a given period T , the 3\u03c3 detection threshold P thr (T ) is set so that 99.7 % of all white noise samples feature lower values of P . This threshold is indicated by the dashed line in figure 5. Over a broad range of periods, we obtain values of P thr \u2248 7 (3\u03c3).",

The appearance of these additional peaks indicates that there are deviations of the modulation pattern from a simple year-long sinusoidal. Dividing the data sample by the main modulation allows to investigate whether the side-peaks are reflections of the annual modulations at harmonic frequencies. This procedure increases the significance of the peak at T = 0.5 years to P = 15, while both the peaks at T = 0.05 years and T = 1.7 years are pushed below detection threshold. To further investigate this semi-annual modulation, a second sinusoid was added to the direct fit to the data set (eq. 4.1). The period of the second sinusoid fits to T = (179 \u00b1 2) days, and the amplitude to A = (0.37 \u00b1 0.07) %.

            "text": "Borexino has reached four years of continuous data taking at LNGS under a rock coverage of 3800 m w.e. Due to the spherical geometry of the detector, we have measured the underground cosmic muon flux with reduced systematics: (3.41\u00b10.01)\u202210 \u22124 m \u22122 s \u22121 . We also have observed a seasonal modulation of the flux and measured the amplitude to be (1.29 \u00b1 0.07) % and the phase to be (179 \u00b1 6) days corresponding to a maximum on the 28 th of June. To invesitgate the correlation between air temperature variations and changes in the muon flux, we have obtained air temperature data from global atmospheric models for the same four years period. We showed that the annual modulation is also present in the effective temperature data, with oscillation parameters compatible with those of the muon modulation. We then showed that the two data sets are positively correlated (R = 0.60) and we measured the effective temperature coefficient to be \u03b1 T = 0.93 \u00b1 0.04. This result is compatible with theoretical expectations and is an improvement in precision from previous measurements at Gran Sasso.",

The parameters B 1 \u03c0,K reflect the relative atmospheric attenuation of mesons; the threshold energy, E thr , is the energy required for a muon to survive to a particular underground depth and \u03b8 is the angle between the muon and the vertical directions; the attenuation lengths for the cosmic ray primaries, pions and kaons are \u039b N , \u039b \u03c0 and \u039b K respectively with 1/\u039b \u03c0,K = 1/\u039b N \u2212 1/\u039b \u03c0,K . The meson critical energy, \u03c0,K , is the meson energy for which decay and interaction have an equal probability. The value of E thr cos \u03b8 used here is the median of the distribution. The values for these parameters can be found in table 1 of [6], with the exception of E thr cos \u03b8 which is site dependent and is found by MC simulations. At LNGS E thr cos \u03b8 = 1.833 TeV according to [19]. The dependence of W (X) on E thr is however moderate.",
