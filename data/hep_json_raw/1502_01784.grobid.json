            "text": "Leptonic \u03c4 decays are generally well suited to investigate the Lorentz structure of electroweak interactions in a model-independent way [1]. In particular, leptonic radiative decays \u03c4 \u2192 l\u03b3\u03bd\u03bd, where the charged lepton (l) is either an electron (e) or a muon (\u00b5), have been studied for a long time because they are sensitive to the anomalous magnetic moment of the \u03c4 lepton [2]. At tree level, these decays can proceed through three Feynman diagrams depending on whether the photon is emitted by the incoming \u03c4 , the outgoing charged lepton, or the intermediate W boson, as shown in Fig. 1. The amplitude for the emission of the photon by the intermediate boson is suppressed by a factor (m \u03c4 /M W ) 2 with respect to a photon from the incoming/outgoing fermions and is thus negligible with respect to next-to-leading order (NLO) QED radiative corrections [3]. Both branching fractions have been measured by the CLEO collaboration. CLEO obtained B(\u03c4 \u2192 \u00b5\u03b3\u03bd\u03bd) = (3.61 \u00b1 0.16 \u00b1 0.35) \u00d7 10 \u22123 , and B(\u03c4 \u2192 e\u03b3\u03bd\u03bd) = (1.75 \u00b1 0.06 \u00b1 0.17) \u00d7 10 \u22122 for a minimum photon energy of 10 MeV in the \u03c4 rest frame [4]. In addition, the OPAL collaboration finds B(\u03c4 \u2192 \u00b5\u03b3\u03bd\u03bd) = (3.0 \u00b1 0.4 \u00b1 0.5) \u00d7 10 \u22123 for a minimum photon energy of 20 MeV in the \u03c4 rest frame [5]. * Now at: University of Tabuk, Tabuk 71491, Saudi Arabia \u2020 Also at: Universit\u00e0 di Perugia, Dipartimento di Fisica, I-06123 Perugia, Italy \u2021 Now at: Laboratoire de Physique Nucl\u00e9aire et de Hautes Energies, IN2P3/CNRS, F-75252 Paris, France \u00a7 Now at: University of Huddersfield, Huddersfield HD1 3DH, UK \u00b6 Deceased * * Now at: University of South Alabama, Mobile, Alabama 36688, USA \u2020 \u2020 Also at: Universit\u00e0 di Sassari, I-07100 Sassari, Italy",

This analysis uses data recorded by the BABAR detector at the PEP-II asymmetric-energy e + e \u2212 storage rings operated at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory. The data sample consists of 431 fb \u22121 of e + e \u2212 collisions recorded at at the center-of-mass energy (CM) \u221a s = 10.58 GeV [6]. The cross section for \u03c4 -pair production is \u03c3 \u03c4 \u03c4 = 0.919 \u00b1 0.003 nb [7] corresponding to a data sample of about 400 \u00d7 10 6 \u03c4 -pairs. A detailed description of the BABAR detector is given elsewhere [8,9]. Charged particle momenta are measured with a five-layer double-sided silicon vertex tracker and a 40-layer helium-isobutane drift chamber inside a 1.5 T superconducting solenoid magnet. An electromagnetic calorimeter (EMC) consisting of 6580 CsI(Tl) crystals is used to measure electron and photon energies; a ring-imaging Cherenkov detector is used to identify charged hadrons; the instrumented magnetic flux return (IFR) is used for muon identification. About half of the data were taken with the IFR embedded with resistive plate chambers, later partially replaced by limited streamer tubes.",

Final-state radiative effects for \u03c4 decays in Tauola are simulated using Photos [12]. A signal \u03c4 -pair MC sample is generated where one of the \u03c4 leptons decays to \u03c4 \u2192 l\u03b3\u03bd\u03bd, and the other decays according to known decay modes [13].

The \u03c4 \u2192 l\u03b3\u03bd\u03bd decays with E * \u03b3,min < 10 MeV are treated as background. A separate \u03c4 -pair MC sample is generated requiring each \u03c4 lepton to decay in a mode based on current experimental knowledge; we exclude signal events in the former sample to obtain a \u03c4 -pair background sample. Other MC simulated background samples include \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 , qq (u\u016b, dd, ss, cc), and BB (B = B + , B 0 ) events. The \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 events are generated by KK2f, qq events are generated using the JETSET generator [14] while BB events are simulated with EVTGEN [15].

Using fully reconstructed e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 \u03b3 events, we find that the photon detection efficiency for data and MC samples are consistent within 1% for E \u03b3 > 1 GeV.

The uncertainty on the probability of misidentifying the pion as a muon or electron is evaluated using samples of \u03c4 \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0\u03c0\u03bd decays. The corresponding systematic uncertainty on the efficiency for \u03c4 \u2192 l\u03b3\u03bd\u03bd is 1.5% for both channels. For the background estimation, we define control regions that are enhanced with background events. For \u03c4 \u2192 \u00b5\u03b3\u03bd\u03bd, where the major background contribution is not peaking in cos \u03b8 \u00b5\u03b3 , we invert the cut on cos \u03b8 \u00b5\u03b3 . For cos \u03b8 \u00b5\u03b3 < 0.8, the maximum expected signal rate is 3% of the corresponding background rate. The maximum discrepancy between the MC sample prediction and the number of observed events is 8%, with an excess of events in the MC sample. We take this discrepancy as estimate of the uncertainty on the background prediction. For \u03c4 \u2192 e\u03b3\u03bd\u03bd, where the major background contributions have similar cos \u03b8 e\u03b3 distributions as signal, we apply a similar strategy after requiring the invariant mass M l\u03b3 < 0.14 GeV/c 2 ; in this case we take cos \u03b8 e\u03b3 < 0.90. The maximum contamination of signal events in this region is 10%, and the maximum discrepancy between the prediction and the number of observed events is 4% with an excess of data events. We take this value as an estimate of the uncertainty on the background rate. The errors on the branching fractions due to the uncertainty on background estimates are 0.9% for \u03c4 \u2192 \u00b5\u03b3\u03bd\u03bd, and 0.7% for \u03c4 \u2192 e\u03b3\u03bd\u03bd, respectively (Table II).",
