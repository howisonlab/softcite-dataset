            "text": "An inclusive search is performed for supersymmetry in final states containing jets and an apparent imbalance in transverse momentum, p miss T , due to the production of unobserved weakly interacting particles in pp collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV. The data, recorded with the CMS detector at the CERN LHC, correspond to an integrated luminosity of 18.5 fb \u22121 . The dimensionless kinematic variable \u03b1 T is used to discriminate between events with genuine p miss T associated with unobserved particles and spurious values of p miss T arising from jet energy mismeasurements. No excess of event yields above the expected standard model backgrounds is observed. The results are interpreted in terms of constraints on the parameter space of several simplified models of supersymmetry that assume the pair production of top squarks. The search provides sensitivity to a broad range of top squark (t) decay modes, including the two-body decay t \u2192 c\u03c7 0 1 , where c is a charm quark and \u03c7 0 1 is the lightest neutralino, as well as the four-body decay t \u2192 b ff \u03c7 0 1 , where b is a bottom quark and f and f are fermions produced in the decay of an intermediate off-shell W boson. These modes dominate in scenarios in which the top squark and lightest neutralino are nearly degenerate in mass. For these modes, top squarks with masses as large as 260 and 225 GeV are excluded, respectively, for the two-and four-body decays.",

            "text": "The standard model (SM) is widely regarded as an effective approximation, valid at low energies, of a more complete theory of particle interactions, such as supersymmetry (SUSY) [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8], which would supersede the SM at higher energy scales. A realisation of SUSY with TeV-scale third-generation squarks is motivated by the cancellation of quadratically divergent loop corrections to the mass of the Higgs boson [9,10] avoiding the need for significant fine tuning [7,8,11]. In R-parity-conserving SUSY [12], supersymmetric particles (sparticles) such as squarks and gluinos are produced in pairs and decay to the lightest stable supersymmetric particle (LSP), which is generally assumed to be a weakly interacting and massive neutralino, \u03c7 0 1 . A characteristic signature of these events is a final state with jets accompanied by an apparent, significant imbalance in transverse momentum, p miss T , due to unobserved \u03c7 0 1 particles that can carry substantial momentum.

Improved experimental acceptance for systems with compressed mass spectra can be achieved by requiring the sparticles to be produced in association with jets from initial-state radiation (ISR). The sparticle decay products from these systems can be Lorentz boosted to values of transverse momentum p T within the experimental acceptance if they recoil against a sufficiently high-p T jet from ISR. This topology is exploited by searches that consider \"monojet\" + p miss T final states [21][22][23] reliance on ISR is reduced for systems with larger m, as in this case the sparticle decay products can have sufficiently large values of p T to lie within the experimental acceptance even without the Lorentz boost from ISR. This letter presents an inclusive search for the pair production of massive coloured sparticles in final states with two or more energetic jets and p miss T in pp collisions at \u221a s = 8 TeV. The data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 18.5 \u00b1 0.5 fb \u22121 [24] collected with the CMS detector at the LHC. The search is based upon a kinematic variable \u03b1 T , described in Section 3, which offers powerful discrimination against SM multijet production, and adheres to a strategy of maximising experimental acceptance through the application of loose selection requirements to provide sensitivity to a wide range of SUSY models.  [21][22][23]. Recent searches for top squark production in leptonic final states can be found in Refs. [55] (and references therein) and [56,57].",

The three discriminants provide sensitivity to different production mechanisms of massive coloured sparticles at hadron colliders (i.e. squark-squark, squark-gluino, and gluinogluino), to a large range of mass splittings between the parent sparticle and the LSP, and to third-generation squark signatures. While the search results can be interpreted with a broad range of models involving the strong production of coloured sparticles leading to final states with both low and high b quark content, we focus on the parameter space of simplified models [58][59][60] that assumes the pair production of top squarks, including the nearly mass-degenerate scenarios described above. Furthermore, interpretations are provided for top squarks that decay to the \u03c7 0 1 either directly in association with a top quark (t \u2192 t\u03c7 0 1 ), or via an intermediate lightest chargino \u03c7 \u00b1",

[28] in order to increase the sensitivity to models with nearly mass-degenerate t and \u03c7 0 1 states. The signal region is extended to incorporate events with a low level of jet activity using a parked data set collected with a dedicated trigger stream [61], where \"parked\" means that, due to limitations in the available processing capability, the data were recorded without being processed through the reconstruction software, and were processed only subsequent to the end of the 2012 data collection period. Furthermore, tight requirements on a combination of kinematic variables are employed to suppress multijet production to the sub-percent level relative to the total remaining number of background events from other SM processes. Finally, an event veto based on isolated tracks is used to further suppress SM background contributions from \u03c4 \u2192 hadrons + \u03bd decays and misreconstructed electrons and muons. These features yield an increased experimental acceptance to events with low jet activity, and improvements in the control of SM backgrounds, which are crucial for enhancing sensitivity to new sources of physics with nearly degenerate mass spectra.",

This type of background, typical of multijet events, is suppressed while maintaining high efficiency for SM or new-physics processes with genuine p miss T by requiring H miss T /E miss T < 1.25. The second veto considers the minimum azimuthal separation between a jet and the negative of the vector sum derived from the transverse momenta of all other jets in the event, which is referred to as \u03c6 * min [25]. This variable is employed to suppress potential contributions from energetic multijet events that have significant p miss T through the production of neutrinos in semileptonic heavy-flavour decays. Such neutrinos are typically collinear with the axis of a jet. We impose the requirement \u03c6 * min > 0.3, which effectively suppresses this background as determined using control data. with respect to the signal region.

At higher jet or b quark jet multiplicities, tt and single top production also become an important source of background. For W boson decays that yield an electron or muon (possibly originating from leptonic \u03c4 decays), the background arises when the e or \u03bc is not rejected through the dedicated lepton vetoes. Background also arises when the \u03c4 lepton decays to neutrinos and hadrons, which are identified as a jet. The veto of events containing at least one isolated track is efficient at further suppressing these backgrounds, including those from single-prong \u03c4 -lepton decays, by as much as \u223c50% for categories enriched in tt. The production of W and Z bosons in association with jets is simulated with the leading-order (LO) MadGraph 5.1.1.0 [76] event generator, with up to four additional partons considered in the matrix element calculation. The production of tt and single top quark events is generated with the next-to-leading-order (NLO) powheg 1.0 [77][78][79][80] program. The LO pythia 6.4.26 [81] program is used to generate WW, WZ, and ZZ (diboson) events, and to describe parton showering and hadronisation for all samples. The CTEQ6L1 [82] and CT10 [83] parton distribution functions (PDFs) are used with MadGraph and powheg, respectively. The description of the detector response is implemented using the Geant4 [84] package. The simulated samples are normalised by the most accurate cross section calculations currently available, usually up to next-to-nextto-leading-order (NNLO) accuracy in QCD [85][86][87][88][89]. To model the effects of pileup, the simulated events are generated with a nominal distribution of pp interactions per bunch crossing and then reweighted to match the pileup distribution measured in data. The method relies on the use of transfer factors that are constructed per bin, with a binning scheme defined identically to that of the signal region in terms of N jet , N b , and H T , for each control sample in data. The transfer factors are determined using simulated events, and are given by the ratios of the expected yields in the corresponding bins of the signal region and control samples. The transfer factors are used to extrapolate from the event yield measured in a data control sample to the expectation for background from a particular SM process or processes in the signal region. The method aims to minimise the effects of simulation mismodelling, as many systematic biases are expected to largely cancel in the ratios used to define the transfer factors. Uncertainties in the transfer factors are determined from a data-derived approach, described below.",

The systematic uncertainties in the transfer factors, determined from the ensemble of closure tests described above and with magnitudes in the range 4-26% (Table 2), are accommodated in the likelihood function through a nuisance parameter associated with each transfer factor used in the background estimation for each (N jet , N b ) category and H T interval. The H T intervals are defined by pairs of adjacent H T bins for the region H T > 375 GeV, as described in Section 7, and so adjacent bins share the same nuisance parameter. The measurements of these parameters are assumed to follow a lognormal distribution. Table 3 summarises the observed event yields and expected number of events from SM processes in the signal region as a function of N jet , N b , and H T . The \"a priori\" SM expectations are deter-mined from event counts in the data control samples and transfer factors from simulation, and are therefore independent of the signal region. No significant discrepancies are observed between the \"a priori\" SM expectations and the observed event yields. In addition, a simultaneous fit to data in the signal region and in up to three control regions is performed. The likelihood function is maximised over all fit parameters under the SM-only hypothesis in order to estimate the yields from SM processes in each bin in all regions, in the absence of an assumed contribution from signal events. Table 3 summarises these estimates (labelled \"SM\") for the signal region. A goodness-of-fit test is performed to quantify the degree of compatibility between the observed yields and the expectations under the background-only hypothesis. The test is based on a log likelihood ratio and the alternative hypothesis is defined by a \"saturated\" model [91]. The p-value probabilities for all N jet and N b categories are found to be uniformly distributed, with a minimum value of 0.19.",

Simulated events of the production and decay of top squark pairs are generated without polarization of the top quarks. Models with m\u02dct < 200 GeV are not considered, due to significant signal contributions in the control regions. Top squark masses up to 500 GeV are excluded, and \u03c7 0 1 masses up to 100 and 50 GeV are excluded for the two-and three-body decays, respectively. As in Fig. 3 (middle right), the observed limit is around 2\u03c3 below the expected result for large values of m\u02dct. This is mainly due to an excess of observed counts in data in the N b = 2 categories in the region of 500 < H T < 700 GeV, which is compatible with a statistical fluctuation. The observed limits lie closer to the expected values at low top squark masses, which correspond to lower values of H T for which good agreement between the data and SM background predictions is observed. Fig. 3 (lower right) presents a summary of all the expected and observed exclusion contours and indicates that the analysis has good sensitivity across many different decay signatures in the m\u02dct-m\u03c70 1 plane. The sensitivity for these models is typically driven by categories involving events satisfying N jet \u2265 4 and 1 \u2264 N b \u2264 2, while events with lower N jet and N b multiplicities become increasingly important for nearly mass-degenerate models.",

The final states analysed contain two or more jets with large transverse energies and a significant imbalance in the event transverse momentum, as expected in the production and decay of massive squarks and gluinos. Dedicated triggers made it possible to extend the phase space covered in this search to values of H T and H miss T as low as 200 and 130 GeV, respectively. These regions of low H T and H miss T correspond to regions of phase space that are highly populated in models with low-mass squarks and nearly degenerate mass spectra. The signal region is binned according to H T , the number of reconstructed jets, and the number of jets identified as originating from b quarks. The sum of standard model backgrounds in each bin is estimated from a simultaneous binned likelihood fit to the event yields in the signal region and in \u03bc + jets, \u03bc\u03bc + jets, and \u03b3 + jets control samples. The observed yields in the signal region are found to be in agreement with the expected contributions from standard model processes.",

The method relies on generator-level information contained in the simulation to determine the distribution of N b for a sample of events categorised according to N jet and H T . First, simulated events are categorised according to the number of jets per event that are matched to underlying b quarks (N gen b ), c quarks (N gen c ), and light-flavoured quarks or gluons (N gen q ). Second, the efficiency with which b quark jets are identified, and the misidentification probabilities for c quarks and light-flavour partons, f c and f q , respectively, are also determined from simulation, with each quantity averaged over jet p T and \u03b7 per event category. Corrections to , f c , and f q are applied on a jet-by-jet basis as a function of p T and \u03b7 so that they match the corresponding quantity measured in data [71]. Finally, N tag b , N tag c , and N tag q are, respectively, the number of jets identified (\"tagged\") as originating from b quarks per event when the underlying parton is a b quark, c quark, or a lightflavoured quark or gluon, and P (N tag b ; N gen b , ), P (N tag c ; N gen c , f c ), and P (N tag q ; N gen q , f q ) are the binomial probabilities for this to happen. These quantities are sufficient to estimate how events are distributed according to N b per (N jet , H T ) category when summing over all relevant combinations that satisfy the requirements N jet = N event yields determined with the method described above are subsequently used to determine the transfer factors binned according to N b (in addition to N jet and H T ). The uncertainties in the transfer factors obtained from simulation are evaluated through sets of closure tests based on events from the data control regions [28]. Each set uses the observed event counts in up to eleven bins in H T for a given sample of events, along with the corresponding (H T -dependent) transfer factors obtained from simulation, to determine H T -dependent predictions N pred (H T ) for yields in another event sample. The two samples are taken from different data control regions, or are subsets of the same data control sample with differing requirements on N jet or N b . The predictions N pred (H T ) are compared with the H T -binned observed yields N obs (H T ) and the level of closure is defined by the deviation of the ratio (N obs \u2212 N pred )/N pred from zero. A large number of tests are performed to probe key aspects of the modelling that may introduce an N jet -or H T -dependent source of bias in the transfer factors [28].Systematic uncertainties are determined from core sets of closure tests, of which the results are shown inFig. 2. Five sets of tests are performed independently for each of the two N jet categories, and a further three sets that are common to both N jet",

Error bars represent statistical uncertainties only, while the grey shaded bands represent the N jet -and H T -dependent uncertainties assumed in the transfer factors, as determined from the procedure described in the text.categories. The tests aim to probe for the presence of statistically significant biases that could arise due to limitations in the method.For each N jet category, the first three sets of closure tests are performed using the \u03bc + jets sample. The first set probes the modelling of the \u03b1 T distribution for events containing genuine p miss T from neutrinos (open circle markers). Two sets (crosses, squares) probe the relative composition between W + jets and top events and the modelling of the reconstruction of b quark jets. The fourth set (triangles) validates the modelling of vector boson production by connecting the \u03bc + jets and \u03bc\u03bc + jets control samples, which are enriched in W + jets and Z + jets events, respectively. The fifth set (swiss crosses) deals with the consistency between the \u03b3 + jets and \u03bc\u03bc + jets samples, which are both used to provide an estimate of the Z \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc + jets background. Three further sets of closure tests (stars, inverted triangles, diamonds), one per data control sample, probe the simulation modelling of the N jet distribution for a range of background compositions.

For the region H T > 375 GeV, all tests within 200 GeV-wide intervals in H T , defined by pairs of adjacent bins, are combined to determine the systematic uncertainty, which is assumed to be fully correlated for bins within each interval, and fully uncorrelated for different H T intervals and N jet categories. The magnitudes of the systematic uncertainties are indicated by shaded grey bands in Fig. 2 and summarised inTable 2. The same (uncorrelated) value of systematic uncertainty is assumed for each N b category.
