            "text": "Observed since the 1950's, the seasonal effect on underground muons is a well studied phenomenon. The interaction height of incident cosmic rays changes as the temperature of the atmosphere changes, which affects the production height of mesons (mostly pions and kaons). The decay of these mesons produces muons that can be detected underground. The production of muons is dominated by pion decay, and previous work did not include the effect of kaons. In this work, the methods of Barrett and MACRO are extended to include the effect of kaons. These efforts give rise to a new method to measure the atmospheric K/\u03c0 ratio at energies beyond the reach of current fixed target experiments. These methods were applied to data from the MINOS far detector. A method is developed for making these measurements at other underground detectors, including OPERA, Super-K, IceCube, Baksan and the MINOS near detector.",

            "text": "When cosmic rays interact in the stratosphere, mesons are produced in the primary hadronic shower. These mesons either interact again and produce lower energy hadronic cascades, or decay into high energy muons which can penetrate to detectors deep underground. The temperature of the stratosphere remains nearly constant, only changing slowly over longer timescales such as seasons (with the exception of the occasional Sudden Stratospheric Warming events observed during wintertime at high latitudes [1]). An increase in temperature of the stratosphere causes a decrease in density, reducing the chance of meson interaction, resulting in a larger fraction decaying to produce muons. This results in a higher muon rate observed deep underground [2,3,4,5,6]. The effect increases as higher energy muons are sampled, because higher energy mesons with increased lifetimes (due to time dilation) are involved. This effect permits the measurement of the atmospheric charged kaon/pion production ratio. The rate of low energy muons at the surface of the earth is also affected by the temperature because the varying production altitude changes the chances of the muon decaying before reaching earth, but this effect is not relevant for detectors deeper than 50 mwe [3] (meters water equivalent).",

It is assumed that meson production falls off exponentially as e \u2212X/\u039b N where \u039b N is the absorption mean free path of the cosmic rays and X is the slant depth of atmospheric material traversed. It is also assumed that the mesons retain the same direction as their progenitors, that the cosmic ray sky is isotropic in solid angle at the top of the atmosphere, and ionization is neglected. These assumptions are particularly valid for the large energies of the mesons that produce muons seen in deep underground detectors such as Baksan [7], Super-K [8], IceCube [9] and MINOS far detector (MINOS FD) and near detector (MINOS ND) [10]. In this approximation, \u039b N is constant. Two meson absorption processes will be considered: further hadronic interactions, dX/\u039b M , where dX is the amount of atmosphere traversed, and M \u2192 \u00b5\u03bd \u00b5 decay.

A muon energy and cos \u03b8 were chosen out of the differential muon intensity (Eq. 12). A random azimuthal angle, \u03c6, was chosen and combined with cos \u03b8. Column depth was calculated as d = h/ cos \u03b8, where h is the detector depth in mwe for standard rock with flat overburden. The threshold surface energy required for a muon to survive this column depth is found from the expression for threshold energy (Eq. 11). If the chosen E \u00b5 was greater than E th , it was used in the calculation of the theoretical \u03b1 T . This was repeated for 10,000 successful muons with E \u00b5 > E th , at depths from 0 to 4,000 mwe. The result of this calculation, along with the experimental result from the MINOS experiment [5] can be seen in Fig. 3 as the solid line.

            "text": "beyond the energy of current fixed target experiments. With a detector area roughly 1,000 times the area of the MINOS FD, IceCube should have a cosmic ray muon rate of upon completion of construction (Boreal Spring, 2011) of 1,700 Hz [21]. Assuming a temperature data set of comparable quality to the BADC ECMWF data [22] used by the MINOS-FD analysis [5], the statistical uncertainty in \u03b1 T could be reduced to \u00b10.001. Since the absorber material surrounding IceCube is ice instead of rock containing iron veins, the column depth should be more well known. This could reduce the uncertainty in the depth map, the dominant source of uncertainty in (\u03b1 T ) \u03c0,K , by half. These factors taken together could reduce the uncertainty in the measurement of r(K/\u03c0) by 16-30%.",

            "text": "A new method was developed to include the effect of kaons in measurement of seasonal variations in underground muon intensity. A temperature coefficient that accounts for the kaon contribution was described, and a kaon-inclusive model was defined. These methods were applied to MINOS-FD data [5], and the new model fit the data better than the pion only model [3]. A formula was described so that other underground experiments, OPERA, Super-K, IceCube, Baksan and the MI-NOS ND could quickly apply this method to their data. Pion and kaon decay are affected differently by temperature variations, and this difference suggested a method to measure the atmospheric K/\u03c0 ratio. This method was developed and a formula was offered for other underground experiments to follow.",

The solid lines show the meson intensity as a function of atmospheric depth (Eq. 4) and the dotdash lines show the muon intensity as a function of atmospheric depth (Eq. 7). The normalization in Eq. 4 (N 0 Z N M /\u039b N ) was set to 1 to show the dependence on X more clearly. The range of the expressions were adjusted so that the maximum value of the OPERA meson intensity was equal to 1, and the other equations were scaled appropriately. These figures were produced with particular energy values corresponding to the threshold energy of the detectors under consideration. The blue lines used the OPERA threshold energy, the red lines used the Super-K threshold energy, the black lines used the MINOS FD threshold energy, the green lines used the IceCube threshold energy, the violet lines used the Baksan threshold energy and the magenta lines used the MINOS ND threshold energy .",
