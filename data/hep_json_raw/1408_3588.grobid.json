To compare sensitivities of these measurements, estimates using the conventional Yukawa parametrization are introduced. Since these experiments were triggered by the prediction of the large extra-dimension model, experiments performed at different length scales are compared with this prediction. In this paper, a direct comparison between laboratory-scale experiments and the LHC results is presented for the first time. A laboratory experiment is shown to determine the best limit at M D > 4.6 TeV and \u03bb < 23 \u00b5m. In addition, new analysis results are described for atomic systems used as gravitational microlaboratories.",

Even now, the law remains the least precisely tested of all fundamental physical laws. In fact, Newtonian gravitational constant has been determined only to a precision of 10 \u22124 , while, for example, the fine structure constant \u03b1 F is known to a precision of 10 \u221210 .

The existence of this new composition-dependent gravitational force, i.e., nonzero\u03b1, would lead to a violation of universality of free fall at short range. Many experiments tried to find evidence of a composition-dependent G over various length scales. Although this fifth force proposals essentially introduces a violation of the universality of G, experimental constraints on\u03b1 can be set without directly testing for composition dependence using different material combinations; instead, all that is required is merely the test for distance dependence. Therefore, all modern experimental tests on the inverse square law can also test this fifth force proposal. Of course, such tests cannot provide evidence that\u03b1 exists; they can only set upper limits. Following these attempts to find deviations from the Newtonian gravitational inverse square law, since the beginning of 1990's, we have come to believe that the inverse square law is confirmed to a precision of 10 \u22124 at cm scale. Very detailed descriptions are summarized in the textbooks written by Fischbach and Talmadge (Fischbach & Talmadge 1999) and by Franklin (Franklin 1993). Then in 1998, a striking model of large extra-dimensions was proposed by Arkani-Hamed, Dimopoulos, and Dvali (ADD model). This model predicts a violation of the gravitational inverse square law at approximately 0.1 mm, provided that there are two additional \"large\" spatial dimensions outside our four-dimensional space-time; these extra-dimensions were invoked to naturally resolve the so-called hierarchy problem (Arkani-Hamed et al. 1998, Arkani-Hamed et al. 1999. Figure 2 illustrates the force strength F of the four fundamental interactions as functions of distance r between two quarks or two electrons. The linear slopes represent the inverse square law F \u221d 1/r 2 . Although Figure 2 is not based on rigorous calculation, we can grasp a rough estimate of the relation between the fundamental interactions. Note that the gravitational inverse square law has been precisely tested only at above laboratory scale, where the line is solid; the region wherein the gravitational force has not been observed is shown as a dashed line. In contrast, the electric force law has only been tested at below laboratory scale. The other two interactions, the strong and weak interactions, tend, by a renormalization calculation, to have the same order of force strength as the electric force at around 10 \u221220 m. From Figure 2, the hierarchy problem can be visually interpreted as the big gap between gravity and the three other interactions at below collider scales of 10 \u221219 m, which corresponds to a de Broglie wave length \u03bb = h/p at TeV energies.",

Application of the null measurement itself does not improve the precision; however, it can reduce the measuring dynamic range, which can help improve the reading resolution. Nevertheless, if the precision is dominated by random mechanical movements, a reduced dynamic range does not improve precision.

In these experiments, torques from the two different source masses, which are located at different distances from the nearest test mass, are designed to be balanced.

Just as for the Casimir force region, the dominant forces on these systems are known standard model interactions, such as electromagnetic interactions, as well as strong and weak interactions. Therefore, these constraints are estimated to be the maximum allowed strength of strong gravity within the experimental precision of the standard model interactions. Most of these constraints on \u03b1 \u2212 \u03bb parameter space (hydrogen atom, antiprotonic (pbar) helium atom, muonic hydrogen, LEP/TEVATRON/LHC) were obtained in the present study, as described in Section 5.3. Note that the results from high-energy collider experiments assume graviton-producing phenomena; in contrast, other nuclear and atomic data were analyzed by assuming classical gravitational phenomena. Therefore, the theoretical reliabilities used in the evaluations are very different.",

To set experimental constraints on the n \u2212 \u03bb parameter space in the power-law parametrization without using raw experimental data, such as \u03b4, several typical constraint curves on the \u03b1 \u2212 \u03bb space were chosen, as shown in Figure 10. These representative curves were selected to reproduce the important kink points (for Irvine, Washington, Stanford, Casimir, pbar-He, and LHC), using the point-mass formula in (21). Then, the corresponding values of \u03b4 for these representative curves can be obtained; this enables us to interpret the constraints in the Yukawa form in terms of the powerlaw form. The results are shown in Figure 11. Results from collider experiments were obtained assuming the ADD model; this allows us to interpret the results obtained as \"n vs M D \" in the form of \u03b1 \u2212 \u03bb.

This constraint is stronger than that in the original publication by the University of Washington group (Kapner et al. 2007) wherein corresponding values were estimated from an \u03b1 \u2212 \u03bb plot by searching over \u03bb at \u03b1 = 8/3 (Adelberger et al. 2003) and assuming Yukawa potential approximation; the latter is valid if the experiment is performed around \u03bb. As discussed in Section 1, the ADD model is primarily expressed in a power-law functional form. However, the conventional Yukawa form can only be applied near \u03bb \u223c r by assuming that lowest order diagram exchanges the lightest graviton. Indeed, interpretation of n in the ADD model in terms of the Yukawa parameter \u03b1 is possible, as has been calculated by some authors (Kehagias & Sfetsos 2000, Adelberger et al. 2003. For a very small experimental distance r \u226a \u03bb, G(r) must become very large due to the power-law form. However, such magnification at very short distances cannot be represented by constant \u03b1 parameter in the Yukawa parametrization. In fact, \u03b1 should be modified if the Yukawa parametrization is applied to analyze experimental data obtained at r \u226a \u03bb. Setting a Y ukawa (r) = a power (r) indicates that physical phenomena obey a power-law-type dependence, but for experimental data analyzed using the Yukawa form, a modified \u03b1 can be expressed by",

Then, the suppression of Newtonian gravity helps test the inverse square law. In a microscopic measurement, the gravitational force is hidden in the dominant background from Coulomb forces, including the Casimir force.

These measurements were triggered by Long's experimental claim for a violation of the inverse square law (Long 1976); this claim was published after his reanalysis of existing data (Long 1974), which was indicating a violation of the inverse square law. Subsequently, Soviet groups performed a few important precision measurements at cm scale using classic torsion balance bars: ( Figure 13) with \u03b1 < 7 \u00d7 10 \u22123 at \u03bb = 0.4 m (Panov & Frontov 1979), ( Figure 14) with \u03b1 < 5 \u00d7 10 \u22124 at \u03bb = 6 cm (Milyukov 1985), and ( Figure 15) with \u03b1 < 2 \u00d7 10 \u22121 at \u03bb = 2 mm (Mitrofanov & Ponomareva 1988). In the 1980s, the University of Irvine group performed a couple of very accurate measurements using static torsion balance bars, which to date still set the tightest constraints at cm scale: ( Figure 17) with \u03b1 < 1 \u00d7 10 \u22123 at \u03bb = 10 cm (Hoskins et al. 1985), ( Figure 16) with \u03b1 < 2 \u00d7 10 \u22124 at \u03bb = 2 cm (Spero et al. 1980). The Cavendish laboratory group used a torsion balance bar ( Figure 18) with \u03b1 < 1 \u00d7 10 \u22123 at \u03bb = 10 cm (Chen et al. 1984). The University of Maryland group performed experiments without using torsion balances but utilizing superconducting gravity gradiometers with \u03b1 < 1\u00d710 \u22121 at \u03bb = 80 cm (Chan et al. 1982), and with \u03b1 < 5\u00d710 \u22124 at \u03bb = 1 m (Moody & Paik 1993), which still gives the best limit at the 1 m scale. Similarly, Goodkind also performed a superconducting gravimeter experiment with \u03b1 < 1 \u00d7 10 \u22122 at \u03bb = 1 m (Goodkind et al. 1993). The University of Tokyo group performed a series of experiments utilizing gravity wave antenna: with \u03b1 < 3 \u00d7 10 \u22121 at \u03bb = 2 m (Hirakawa et al. 1980), with \u03b1 < 1 \u00d7 10 \u22122 at \u03bb = 50 cm (Ogawa et al. 1982), ( Figure 19) with \u03b1 < 3 \u00d7 10 \u22122 at \u03bb = 10 cm (Kuroda & Hirakawa 1985), and ( Figure 19) with \u03b1 < 2 \u00d7 10 \u22122 at \u03bb = 7 mm (Mio et al. 1987). A similar gravity wave antenna experiment was performed at CERN (Astone et al. 1991). All these results are consistent with the inverse square law. The most significant result is that from the Irvine group.",

            "text": "The second impact on this field was the proposal of the large extra-dimension model (Arkani-Hamed et al. 1998). The striking prediction of a possible violation of the inverse square law at around 0.1 mm triggered many recent sophisticated experiments. Before then, the tightest constraint was given by the result of Mitrofanov (Mitrofanov & Ponomareva 1988). The University of Washington group (E\u00f6t-wash) obtained a very strong constraint \u03b1 < 9 \u00d7 10 \u22123 at \u03bb = 1 mm using a torsion pendulum with missing mass holes on a test disk (Hoyle et al. 2001, Hoyle et al. 2004. They also obtained an upgraded result ( Figure 20) with \u03b1 < 2 \u00d7 10 \u22123 at \u03bb = 0.5 mm (Kapner et al. 2007). Many results from the E\u00f6t-wash group were introduced in (Adelberger et al. 2009), not only for the inverse square law but also for other gravity-related measurements.     (Spero et al. 1980). Test mass (4.4 cm height copper cylinder): m = 20 g. Source mass (inner diameter 6 cm, outer diameter 8 cm, 60 cm height stainless steel pipe): r = 1.8, 5.2 cm, M = 10.44 kg (test mass center to pipe wall radial center). Torsion balance bar (total length) 2L = 60 cm. Sensor : optical lever displacement sensor. Wire : 75 \u00b5m diamater, 32 cm long tungsten. Torsion balance position is stabilized using feedback on electrostatic force plates. Torsion balance is in concentric copper vacuum chamber. Source mass moves reciprocating along the horizontal rail. Figure 17. Experiments of Hoskins at University of California, Irvine (Hoskins et al. 1985). Test mass = torsion balance bar : m = 523 g, 60 cm long copper bar. Source masses (copper cylinder): r =5 cm, M =43 g (near mass center to bar center), r =105 cm, M = 7.3 kg (far source mass center to balance bar center). Wire : tungsten 90 \u00b5m diameter, 20 cm long. Sensor : optical lever displacement sensor. Torsion balance position is stabilized using feedback on electrostatic force plates. Torsion balance is in vacuum chamber surrounded by magnetic and thermal shield. Source near mass moves reciprocating over opposite side of torsion balance. Source far mass moves reciprocating along the horizontal rail. Figure 18. Experiment of Chen at Cavendish Laboratory (Chen et al. 1984). Test mass (phosphor-bronze sphere): 41 g. Source masses (non-magnetic stainless steel cylinder, 10 cm diameter): r 1 = 5 cm (center to center distances), M = 6 kg (10 cm height) and r 2 = 9 cm, M = 25 kg (40 cm height). Torsion balance bar : 60 cm. Wire : tungsten 75 \u00b5m diameter, 80 cm long. Sensor : optical lever displacement sensor. Torsion balance is in glass vacuum chamber.  (Kuroda & Hirakawa 1985). Test mass (gravity wave antenna, side cut aluminum cylinder) 0.85 kg for 10 -15 cm (distance between source and target rotation centers), and 15 kg for 15 -30 cm. Source masses (gravity wave radiator, 35 mm diameter, 45 mm height lead cylinders): 0.49 kg.",

Unlike the HUST and Washington experiments, this experiment did not observe a nonzero gravity signal because of its sensitivity; therefore, only an upper limit on the gravitational force was determined. Similarly, all experiments that followed were performed at below 0.1 mm scales and could not observe a nonzero gravity signal.  (Kapner et al. 2007).

            "text": "There have been many Casimir force experiments that measure electric forces between two metal surfaces. Because of the difficulty of preparing plates as thin as the measuring separation gap d, the data show the \u03b1 \u2212 \u03bb curve with kinks at \u03bb \u223c d, which are similar to that shown in Figure 6. Although not all experiments were intended to test the gravitational law, their results can be used to set the upper limits on \u03b1 using (42). Lamoreaux at the University of Washington performed Casimir force experiments ( Figure 25) with \u03b1 < 2 \u00d7 10 8 at \u03bb = 5 \u00b5m (Lamoreaux 1997) and later with \u03b1 < 2 \u00d7 10 9 at \u03bb = 1 \u00b5m (Sushkov et al. 2011). Masuda obtained ( Figure 26) \u03b1 < 3 \u00d7 10 10 at \u03bb = 1 \u00b5m (Masuda & Sasaki 2009). Obrecht et al. also tested in the \u00b5m range, measuring Casimir-Polder forces (Obrecht et al. 2007), which were analyzed in (Bezerra et al. 2011). There are many other analyses by Bordaq and Mostepanenko et al. (Mostepanenko & Sokolov 1993, Bordag et al. 1998, Bordag et al. 2000, Mostepanenko & Novello 2001, Mostepanenko 2002, Bezerra et al. 2010, Bezerra et al. 2011. Bao et al. also tested below the 200 nm range (Bao et al. 2010). Decca et. al. at Indiana-Purdue University tested ( Figure 27) with \u03b1 < 10 13 at \u03bb = 100 nm (Decca et al. 2005, Decca et al. 2007. The University of California, Riverside group tested with \u03b1 < 10 19 at \u03bb = 10 nm (Harris et al. 2000). Ederth in the Sweden Royal Institute of Technology tested ( Figure 28) with \u03b1 < 5 \u00d7 10 17 at \u03bb = 20 nm (Ederth 2000), which was analyzed in (Mostepanenko & Novello 2001). In addition to Casimir force measurements, van der Waals force measurements were performed (Israelachvili & Tabor 1972), which were analyzed in (Bordag et al. 1994). These data approach \u03b1 \u223c 10 30 at \u03bb \u223c 1 nm. As we saw in Figure 10, these data do not strongly constrain the ADD model at the present precision, compared with the mm scale and collider experiments.",

The PSI data are not consistent with the known proton radius; nevertheless, the data can be used to set the gravitational upper limit. Details of the calculations will be published separately (Tanaka & Murata (to be published )). Several similar theoretical attempts have been made to constrain strong gravity at this scale for the muonic hydrogen atom (Onofrio 2014) and for the antiprotonic helium atom (Salumbides et al. 2014, Bordag et al. 1994. Nuclear charge radii have also been used as a gravity sensor, in which a modification of the nuclear charge radius is estimated from strong gravity (Xu et al. 2013). An electron nuclear scattering experiment (the MTV-G experiment); (Tanaka et al. 2013) was performed to constrain a strong geodetic precession of a scattering electron utilizing a detector setup from the MTV experiment for testing time reversal symmetry (Murata et al. 2014).

Similar to the atomic and nuclear tests, particle collision data can also be used to perform similar analyses that constrain the maximum allowed probability (cross section) of gravitational phenomena above standard model predictions. Several gravitonproducing channels can be used; however, the simplest is the real graviton emission qq \u2192 gG, qg \u2192 qG, and gg \u2192 gG shown in Figure 29. The cross-sectional excess on a monojet produced from the standard model predictions can set upper limits on the gravitational coupling strength. Here, the graviton (G) cannot be observed, unlike quarks (q) or gluons (g), creating QCD jets in the final states. In this channel, only one visible jet is observed; however, the emitted graviton is not observed, so the event is recognized by observing only one jet with large missing momentum. By comparing with the standard model backgrounds, an upper limit on the monojet production cross section can be estimated. Together with mini-black-hole production, which can be expected in strong gravity, results have already been published for the LEP ( \u221a s = 189 \u2212 209 GeV); (Ask 2004), for the TEVATRON ( \u221a s = 1.96 TeV); (Aaltonen et al. 2008, Abbott et al. 2001, and for the LHC ( \u221a s = 7\u22128 TeV); (Aad et al. 2013, Aad et al. 2011, Chatrchyan et al. 2012. In collider experiments, M D is the prime quantity to be determined as a function of n; then, M D is transformed to \u03bb using the ADD model (37). All atomic, nuclear, and particle experiments cannot completely shield the standard model contributions (backgrounds); therefore, the resulting precision is poor because F C is much larger than F N . However, because of their extreme short measuring distances r, they can be sensitive to large values of \u03bb in power-law type models, as shown in Figure 11, which amplify (\u03bb/r) n at a short range. Among all microscopic experiments, the collider experiments are the only sensitive tool that can compete with the 0.1 mm scale experiments for n = 2. For n \u2265 3, none of the laboratory-scale experiments can compete with the collider experiments.",

Although the \u03b1 \u2212 \u03bb parametrization has been widely used because of its historical background, it is not always the best way to compare experimental constraints, especially for the large extra-dimension model. A quantitative treatment based on the power-law parametrization has allowed us, for the first time, to compare results from collider experiments with those from short-range gravity experiments. The comparisons show that at n = 2, stronger constraints can be obtained from 0.1 mm scale measurements than from collider experiments.",
