            "text": "Precise neutrino-nucleus interaction measurements in the sub-multi-GeV region are important to reduce the systematic uncertainty in future neutrino oscillation experiments. Furthermore, an excess of \u03bd e interactions, as a possible interpretation of the existence of a sterile neutrino, has been observed in such an energy region. The nuclear emulsion technique can measure all the final state particles with low energy threshold for a variety of targets (Fe, C, H 2 O, and so on). Its sub\u03bcm position resolution allows measurements of the \u03bd e cross-section with good electron/gamma separation capability. We started a new experiment at J-PARC to study sub-multi-GeV neutrino interactions by introducing the nuclear emulsion technique. The J-PARC T60 experiment has been implemented as a first step in such a project. Systematic neutrino event analysis with full scanning data in the nuclear emulsion detector was performed for the first time. The first neutrino event detection and its analysis are described in this paper. ",

This high spatial resolution allows measurements of all the final state particles with a low energy threshold. Nuclear emulsion has 4\u03c0 track detection capability [16,17]. This is also very useful to investigate the event topology in lowenergy neutrino interactions. Furthermore, good e/\u03b3 separation capability allows measurement of \u03bd e charged current interactions with a strong suppression of the background from \u03bd \u03bc neutral current interactions with \u03c0 0 production. There is much flexibility for target material selection because the detector, a so-called emulsion cloud chamber (ECC), is constructed as a sandwich structure of thin nuclear emulsion films and the target materials.",

A high-speed scanning system for the emulsion has been developed [23][24][25][26][27][28], and track readout for the entire area in the emulsion has recently become available. This allows one to analyze the emulsions independently of the prediction from the electronic detectors.

In this emulsion gel production, high-sensitivity emulsion gel, containing 55% AgBr crystals by volume ratio, was produced [29]. Two emulsion layers, each 50 \u03bcm thick, were formed on both faces of a 180 \u03bcm-thick polystyrene base. The size of sheets was 100 mm \u00d7 125 mm. The long-term variation of the emulsion sensitivity and background noise was investigated using cut pieces of the emulsion sheets. The emulsion sensitivity was measured as grain density (GD), the number of grains per 100 \u03bcm along a minimum ionizing particle (MIP) trajectory. The noise of the emulsion was measured as fog density (FD), the number of randomly distributed grains per 1000 \u03bcm 3 in the emulsion. If an emulsion is left undeveloped for a long time after track recording, the silver atoms tend to oxidize into silver ions, owing to the presence of water and oxygen in the material. Some of the latent image cores are destroyed and fewer grains are produced in the development process. This effect is called fading. Variations of GD and FD over 133 days are shown in Fig. 1 under four different temperature and humidity conditions. We found that GD and FD remain at safe levels even after 133 days at 23 \u2022 C.

In the present work, an emulsion device with timing information played  this role. The emulsion detector intrinsically has no timing information. Therefore, the timing information is produced from the emulsion tracks by track coincidence between the films on a mechanically controlled moving stage [30,31], the so-called \"emulsion shifter.\" An emulsion shifter ( Fig. 3) was reused from a balloon experiment with nuclear emulsion [32]. This equipment gives a time-stamp to the emulsion track by using a clock-based multi-stage emulsion shifter technique. Three stages play the roles of the hour, minute, and second hands of a watch, respectively. Emulsion tracks that are coincident on all three stages obtain a time-stamp corresponding to each stage position. The timing resolution of this emulsion shifter is approximately 7.9 s, which was investigated using tracks passing through the emulsion shifter and electronic detector located at the back of the emulsion detectors. The details for this equipment and the analysis are described in Refs. [32,33].",

The detector was assembled from a total of nine iron layers (58.5 cm) and 11 vertical and horizontal tracking planes. The size of a module is 1.2 m \u00d7 1.2 m \u00d7 0.9 m. INGRID consists of 16 identical modules arranged in horizontal and vertical arrays around the beam center. The original purpose of INGRID was to measure the neutrino beam direction and verify the number of neutrino interactions per protons on target. In the J-PARC T60 experiment, INGRID is utilized to identify the muons from neutrino-nucleus interactions in the ECC. As shown in Fig. 4, the emulsion shifter is placed between the ECC and INGRID. The particles that cross the emulsion shifter are supplied with timestamps. The tracks are then matched between the emulsion detector and INGRID using the timing information.",

The number of grains belonging to the track (blackness) is well correlated with the PH and the VPH. As shown in Fig. 8, the tracks connecting the positions of micro tracks on both sides of the plastic base are called \"base tracks.\" Sub-MeV or few-MeV electrons from the environment are recorded in the emulsion because the nuclear emulsion records all tracks from immediately after production until development with no dead time. Therefore, the automated scanning system recognizes \"fake\" tracks made of low-energy electrons and/or random noise grains (fog). The chance coincidences of these fake tracks become the background of base tracks.

(2) Penetrate track veto: Tracks that have at least one segment on three plates at the most upstream position of the ECC (PL41, PL40, PL39) are rejected as penetrate tracks.

Repeating this procedure 10 times, the background number is estimated as the average value in Fig. 14. (2) Track multiplicity: As a first step, reconstructed vertices are categorized based on their track multiplicity. The three categories are \"three and more tracks,\" \"two tracks,\" and \"single track.\" \"Three and more tracks\" are categorized as Category (a). In Category (a), 7 vertices composed of 25 tracks are found and the estimated number of background vertices is less than 0.1. Thus, the vertices of Category (a) are real vertex candidates because of the low background. In the two-track vertex category, there are 269 vertices composed of 537 tracks, including one duplicated case, as shown in Fig. 15, corresponding to 112.6 background vertices. Then, 40525 tracks are categorized as \"single track\" vertex events [Category (c)]. Single track vertices are mainly considered to be disconnecting of low-energy cosmic ray muons or from electron/positron pair production, as shown in Fig. 13(c). (3) Track blackness: \"Two track\" vertices are categorized according to track blackness. Black tracks are defined as tracks whose average VPH is over 120, and minimum ionizing particle (MIP) tracks are defined as tracks whose average VPH is less than 120, as shown in Fig. 11     According to the comparison between real and background data, an excess of small opening angle is found in the real data. They are almost parallel tracks, so are explained as electron/positron pair production from gamma-rays. Gamma-ray candidate events are selected by using their opening angle and minimum distance of vertex tracks as shown in Fig. 16(c). Thus, 125 vertices are selected as gamma-ray events and the estimated number of background is 0.5, as shown in Fig. 16(d).

Furthermore, the neutrino analysis will proceed in a few-kg water-target emulsion chamber that is assembled with vacuum-packed emulsion films and frametype spacers to fill the water as a target.

In this work, systematic neutrino event analysis with full ECC scanning data has been developed, and the first neutrino event detection has been successfully demonstrated. Moreover, hybrid analysis with INGRID has been performed for the first time. We will polish the systematic neutrino analysis chain, develop the water-target emulsion chamber, and steadily expand the detector scale to reach the desired physics output.",

This system was developed at Nagoya University to quickly analyze particle tracks in emulsion films, and allows tracks to be read out at a scanning speed of \u223c5000 cm 2 h \u22121 . HTS takes 16 tomographic images in an emulsion layer and recognizes a series of grains on a straight line as a track by comparing these images.
