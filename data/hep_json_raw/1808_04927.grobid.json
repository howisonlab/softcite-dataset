The double differential \u03c0 \u00b1 yields were measured with increased precision compared to the previously published NA61/SHINE results, while the K \u00b1 and proton yields were obtained for the first time. A strategy for dealing with the dependence of the results on the incoming proton beam profile is proposed. The purpose of these measurements is to reduce significantly the (anti)neutrino flux uncertainty in the T2K longbaseline neutrino experiment by constraining the production of (anti)neutrino ancestors coming from the T2K target.",

The NA61/SHINE collaboration is pursuing several physics goals including hadron production measurements for T2K (Tokai to Kamioka) [2] an accelerator-based long-baseline neutrino experiment in Japan. The NA61/SHINE measurements are used to reduce the systematic uncertainties associated to the prediction of the (anti)neutrino fluxes in T2K. New measurements of \u03c0 \u00b1 , K \u00b1 and p yields coming from the surface of the T2K replica target are presented here. These results aim at reducing the T2K (anti)neutrino flux uncertainties down to a 3-4% level. They can further be used to tune hadron interaction and transport models.",

            "text": "The T2K neutrino beam is produced at the Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex (J-PARC) [3] by directing a 30 GeV (kinetic energy) proton beam towards a 90-cm-long graphite target. Produced mesons, mostly pions and kaons [4], are focused by a set of three magnetic horns [2] and decay to neutrinos in the decay volume. Focusing horns are aluminum conductors that create a toroidal magnetic field with respect to the beam direction. The polarity of the current in the horns can be changed, so positively or negatively charged pions (kaons) can be focused. In this way, T2K can produce either a neutrino-enhanced (\u03bd \u03bc ) or an antineutrino-enhanced (\u03bd \u03bc ) beam. Since direct hadron production measurements in situ are not possible, Monte Carlo models are used to predict the (anti)neutrino fluxes at the T2K near and far detectors. However, significant differences between hadron production models induce considerable systematic uncertainties on the (anti)neutrino fluxes. Without any experimental data to constrain the hadron production models, these systematic uncertainties would be larger than 25%. For this reason, T2K uses available hadron production measurements, but mostly relies on dedicated NA61/SHINE hadron production data [4].",

            "text": "The NA61/SHINE experiment took data for T2K in 2007, 2009and 2010. In 2007and 2009, measurements were performed with a 30.92 GeV/c proton beam and a 2-cm-thick carbon target (4% of a nuclear interaction length, \u03bb i ) to measure hadron multiplicities (\u03c0 \u00b1 , K \u00b1 , p, K 0 s , \u039b) and the production cross section [5][6][7][8]. Production events represent the fraction of inelastic events in which at least one new hadron in the final state is produced. By using these measurements, the uncertainty on the neutrino flux in T2K was reduced to about 10% [4]. However, the hadron production component of the uncertainty still dominated the total uncertainty due to the insufficient precision of the production cross section measurements and re-interactions inside the target and aluminum horns, which cannot be directly constrained by the measurements of the primary proton-carbon interactions. To further reduce the hadron production uncertainty of the neutrino flux, hadron production measurements with a replica of the T2K target were needed. Measurements with the T2K replica target can directly constrain up to 90% of the neutrino flux because hadron yields at the surface of the target are measured not just for primary interactions, but also for re-interactions inside the target [9]. These measurements were also done in 2007, 2009 and 2010. Measurements from the 2007 run [9] were used as a proof-ofprinciple, while measurements from the 2009 run [10,11] are being incorporated in the T2K neutrino flux simulation. The expected (anti)neutrino flux uncertainty is around 5% [12], representing a significant improvement with respect to the previously published uncertainty of 10%. Measurements from the 2010 run are the main topic of this paper. With respect to the previous results, these measurements of \u03c0 \u00b1 yields have smaller statistical and systematic uncertainties. Furthermore, K \u00b1 and p yields are measured for the first time. This is expected to further reduce the uncertainties on the (anti)neutrino fluxes in T2K from about 10% down to the level of 3-4%. Moreover, since (anti)neutrino fluxes in T2K in the energy region above \u223c 2 GeV are produced mainly by kaon decays, the corresponding uncertainties will be greatly reduced.",

Hadron yields must be measured as a function of the momentum, polar angle and longitudinal position of the hadron exit point on the target surface. In other words, vertices inside the target are not reconstructed. Tracks measured in a detector are only extrapolated to the target surface. Essentially, the target is treated as a black box and measured hadron yields are the sum of yields coming from primary interactions and re-interactions. In addition, T2K requires that the longitudinal position along the target surface is binned in at least six bins: five longitudinal bins 18 cm in size and the downstream target face as a sixth bin [13]. Since the T2K target is inserted in the first focusing horn, hadrons coming from different parts of the target will have different paths through the magnetic field and they will be focused differently by the horns. The previous NA61/SHINE measurements with 2007 and 2009 data have already proven that the NA61/SHINE setup is suitable for measuring hadron yields on the T2K replica target surface, although the target is placed outside of the tracking system.",

The beamline is designed to transport both primary and secondary hadrons and ions from the maximum SPS energy (400 GeV/c) down to 13 A GeV/c. Secondary hadron beams of various momenta are produced by impinging a primary 400 GeV/c proton beam on a beryllium target. Produced hadrons are selected by two spectrometers and a set of collimators according to their rigidity (momentum to charge ratio). The secondary beam is then transported towards NA61/SHINE. The beam is defined by three scintillator counters used in coincidence (S 1 , S 2 and S 3 ) and two scintillator counters with holes used in anticoincidence (V 0 and V p 1 ). The S 3 counter has a radius equal to the target radius, and it was placed 0.5 cm upstream of the target. The V 0 counter has a 1 cm diameter hole centered on the beam axis, which allows the selection of a narrower beam, if necessary. A Cherenkov Differential Counter with Achromatic Ring Focus [14] (CEDAR) and Threshold Cherenkov Counter (THC) were used in coincidence and anti-coincidence respectively to identify beam particles. By changing the gas pressure in these detectors, it is possible to estimate the beam composition. The 30.92 GeV/c beam contains around 76.3% \u03c0 + , 1.6% K + , and 12% protons [13]. The estimated purity of the selected proton sample is better than 99.9%. Finally, the beam position is measured by a set of six multi-wire proportional chambers. Two chambers, one measuring position along the x-axis and another measuring the position along the y-axis, are part of one BPD. The precision of the position measurement in one BPD is around 200 \u00b5m [1].",

The replica target design matches dimensions and material of the T2K graphite core. It was made of Toyo Tanso IG-43 graphite [15]. The target density was estimated by measuring its volume and mass, and it is equal to 1.83\u00b10.03 g cm \u22123 . This value is 1.5% higher than the density of the T2K target, but well within the measurement uncertainty. The target shape was machined to form a 2 cm thick disk with an 88 cm long rod coming from its centre. The radii of the disk and rod are 3.5 cm and 1.3 cm, respectively. The disk was used to mount an aluminium flange which was, in turn, tightened to a target holder. The upstream side of the flange has a hole to minimize beam interactions with aluminium and provide space for the S 3 counter used in the trigger. A schematic overview of the target can be seen in Fig. 2. The position and tilt of the target were adjusted by the screws on the target holder. The downstream face of the target was placed around 67 cm from the upstream side of VTPC-1. ",

All TPCs were inherited from the previous NA49 experiment [16]. The GTPC was introduced in order to measure forward-going particles with small polar angles, \u03b8 < 10 mrad, in the laboratory frame. The magnetic field was set so that the total bending power of the magnets was 1.14 T m. This allowed a momentum resolution of \u03c3 p / p 2 = 5\u00d710 \u22123 (GeV/c) \u22121 , except for very forward tracks that only passed through the GTPC and MTPCs and had a momentum resolution of 22 \u00d7 10 \u22123 (GeV/c) \u22121 [13]. The angular resolution is around 3-4 mrad and it does not change much as a function of angle. The longitudinal position resolution changes with angle. For angles around 20 mrad it is around 15 cm. For larger angles, it goes down to around 2.5 cm. Particles emitted from the downstream face of the target behave differently. Forward going particles are usually emitted from the center of the downstream target face. Therefore, extrapolation usually works quite well in this case. However, higher-angle particles coming from the downstream face of the target are usually emitted closer to the edge. In that case, migration effects increase.",

The T 2 and T 3 triggers select only beam protons that hit the target. The only difference is that T 3 selects a narrower beam because the V 0 counter has a smaller hole. The fourth trigger selects all beam particles that hit the target. It is important to note that T 1 , T 2 and T 4 were prescaled -only a fraction of them was recorded. The prescaling was applied to T 2 to achieve the desired radial distribution of the beam. If an event is a T 2 but not a T 3 , this means that the triggered beam particle is in the tail of the radial distribution on the upstream target face. To reduce the beam tail, only one out of two such events was registered. The achieved radial distribution is shown in Fig. 3. Perfect agreement with the T2K beam profile is not possible since in T2K the beam profile changes on a run-by-run basis. Any differences must be studied before using these measurements in the T2K neutrino beam simulation. Such study is presented in Sect. 6. In total, 10.2\u00d710 6 triggers were recorded. Around 11.7% of the triggers were recorded with the maximum magnetic field of 9 T m. This allowed the recording of beam protons that pass through the target without interacting and the measurements of their parameters in the TPCs. However, all sec-ondary hadrons below 6GeV/c were bent out of the TPCs and did not reach the ToF-F wall. The analysis of data recorded with the maximum magnetic field is a subject of an independent publication. In this paper, the data taken with the standard magnetic field configuration (89.3% of triggers) were analysed, while the high magnetic field subset was used for alignment between the BPDs and TPCs (see Sect. 3.1).",

After event and track selection, selected tracks were binned in momentum ( p), polar angle (\u03b8 ), both measured in the laboratory frame, and longitudinal position of the exit point on the target surface (z), as required by T2K. The different hadron yields were estimated by fitting a two-dimensional dE/dx-m 2 tof distribution for every bin.

This was only possible because S 3 counter, which was part of the trigger, had the same radius as the target and it was placed just upstream of the target. The target upstream z position was measured by surveyors before the data-taking. Once the relative alignment of the target and BPDs was known, the alignment of the TPCs with respect to the BPDs could also be determined. To do so, the data taken with the high magnetic field configuration were used to select events with only one high momentum track corresponding to the beam track. Those tracks were extrapolated to the surveyed z position of the target using an analytical method (see Ref. [17]) with error propagation that accounts for multiple scattering (see Ref. [18]). The positions of the beam tracks extrapolated forward from the BPDs and The distribution of z positions of closest approach for TPC tracks extrapolated to the beam track. Only tracks whose distance to the beam track is within extrapolation uncertainty were selected.

However, by extrapolating TPC tracks and selecting only those for which the point of closest approach to the beam track is within the extrapolation uncertainty, it was possible to check the surveyors' measurement of the target z position. The z distribution of the points of closest approach was plotted and a rising edge could be seen as shown in Fig. 5. The z position at the halfmax of this rising edge was taken to be the upstream target face. Full agreement with the surveyor position measurement was obtained. The final step was to determine the tilt of the target in x \u2212z and y \u2212 z planes. First, the target was assumed to be parallel to the z-axis. Then, only events with beam tracks passing through the whole length of the target were selected. The TPC tracks were again extrapolated backwards until the minimum distance from the beam track was reached. By plotting the x and y distributions for 18 slices in z and checking the width and position of the distributions, it is straightforward to extract any possible tilt of the target. For example, if the target is tilted in positive x direction, edges of the x distributions would be shifted towards the centre because the target is moved from the beam. The shift would increase with z. No appreciable tilt was found. In Table 1 the measured position of the target is summarized with uncertainties for all parameters.",

Afterwards, cuts were applied to increase the quality of the selected track sample. Tracks can have segments in different TPCs and therefore, can be divided into different topologies. For each topology, a different requirement on the number of clusters was applied. For example, if a track passes through the VTPCs, at least 25 points in the VTPCs were required. A cut on the number of clusters in MTPCs was not applied to such tracks. However, tracks with momentum measured only in the GTPC have between four and seven GTPC points. At least six points in the GTPC were required as well as additional 30 points in the MTPCs. This ensured that the track parameters were measured with sufficient precision and that the track did not pass very close to the MTPC walls where possible field distortions are the largest. Afterwards, the azimuthal angle distributions were plotted for polar angle intervals of 20 mrad or 40 mrad. Two different types of azimuthal regions were removed: the regions with rapidly changing acceptance and the regions in which the Monte Carlo acceptance does not correspond to the data. This may be caused by slightly different sizes of the TPCs or distortions of the magnetic field which are not present in the magnetic field maps used in the Monte Carlo simulation. The selected regions in (\u03c6, \u03b8) space are presented in Fig. 6. This reduces the possibility of bias once the Monte Carlo corrections were applied to the data.  Finally, the selected TPC tracks were extrapolated towards the target surface. The track parameters and covariance matrices were saved for the positions where tracks hit the target surface or the minimum distance from the target surface was less than 3\u03c3 R , where \u03c3 R is the extrapolated radial uncertainty. This cut reduced the number of selected tracks that were not coming from the target, but were created in decays or interactions outside of the target.",

The distributions are used to randomly generate beam particles in the NA61/SHINE Monte Carlo simulation [19][20][21]. Also, the starting value for the momentum binning was carefully adjusted. The necessity for this comes from the fact that the ToF-F response was not simulated in the Monte Carlo. Instead, in the reconstruction chain applied to simulated events the tof measurements were just assigned to the tracks that hit the ToF-F wall, and later on the inefficiency of the ToF-F wall was corrected with a data-based correction. Actually, very low momentum particles, depending on their mass, cannot reach the ToF-F wall within the ToF-F acquisition window. Therefore, Monte Carlo corrections in this  It is clear that the efficiency drops if the bar is closer to the beamline (x = 0 cm). This is due to an increasing track density with decreasing distance to the beam region would be heavily biased. For example, momentum bins for protons must start at 0.5 GeV/c. The overall phase space binning covers more than 96% of (anti)neutrinos crossing the T2K far detector (Super-Kamiokande) which are produced by the charged hadrons emitted from the target. More than 97% of (anti)neutrinos produced by pions are covered, while the coverage drops for kaons and protons. This is summarised in Table 2. The phase space of the charged hadrons coming from the T2K target surface that contribute to the (anti)neutrino fluxes in Super-Kamiokande are plotted in Figs. 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11. The top row in each figure represents the coverage for the forward horn current (FHC) corresponding to the neutrino mode, while the bottom row represents the coverage for the reverse horn current (RHC) corresponding to the antineutrino mode. Each column represents a different longitudinal bin. The phase space coverage of the measurements presented in this paper is overlaid on top of the figures as a black line. Since NA61/SHINE added new forward TPCs in 2017 [22], possible future measurements could improve coverage for the forward-going high momentum K \u00b1 and p [23].",

            "text": "Since large fractions of the phase space are covered, a robust particle identification method is needed. For the momentum range between 1 GeV/c and 3 GeV/c (see Fig. 12), the energy loss distributions cross, hence particle identification based on the energy loss alone is not possible. However, in these regions, tof measurements can be used to distinguish between particles. Kaons can be separated easily up to 3 GeV/c, while protons can be separated up to 8 GeV/c, as can be seen in Fig. 13. For higher momentum, the tof resolution becomes too poor, while energy loss measurements allow for better identification. It is clear that both approaches are complementary and therefore they can be combined to cover all the bins. The tof measurement was used to calcu- late the particle mass squared (m 2 tof ) and it was combined with the energy loss. Particles were represented by islands in the m 2 tof -dE/dx space. Therefore, raw hadron yields could be obtained by fitting an appropriate function to the distribution for each phase space bin. Both, m 2 tof and dE/dx were assumed to be normally distributed. This assumption for dE/dx must be closely examined. In general, dE/dx is not normally distributed, as its distribution is similar to the Landau distribution. The measured dE/dx in NA61/SHINE is calculated as a truncated mean (see Ref. [16]) of all energy depositions for all clusters. Therefore, we assume that truncated mean is normally distributed. This is only valid if all tracks have the  However, the dE/dx resolution in NA61/SHINE saturates at around 3.5% for tracks with more than 70 clusters. Around 98.5% of the selected tracks have more than 70 clusters. This is a good justification for using only a single Gaussian for describing energy loss in a single phase space bin for one particle species. Our previous measurements prove this assumption (see Refs. [8,10]). The total fitting function was constructed from four two-dimensional Gaussians, one for each particle species (e \u00b1 , \u03c0 \u00b1 , K \u00b1 , p (p)). The fitting was done in the RooFit framework [24] by using extended loglikelihood minimization which treats the number of observed  In total, there were 20 parameters in the fit: eight mean values, eight standard deviations, and four particle multiplicities. The obtained raw multiplicities must be corrected for various inefficiencies with Monte Carlo and data-based corrections.",

Some of the produced hadrons inside the detector coverage can decay or re-interact in the detector and therefore, they do not hit the TOF-F wall. The percentage of surviving hadrons is given by the hadron loss efficiency. The reconstruction efficiency is a convolution of the efficiency of software algorithms used for the reconstruction and the efficiency of the detector. The selection efficiency corrects for the hadrons lost in the quality selection. The values of momentum ( p), polar angle (\u03b8 ) and longitudinal position along the target surface (z) for each hadron are reconstructed with finite precision. Consequently, some of the hadrons will be placed in a wrong ( p, \u03b8, z) bin. The ratio of the number of hadrons which are reconstructed in a given bin to the number of hadrons which are simulated in the same bin represents the migration efficiency.

Since the ToF-F wall was placed just downstream of the MTPCs, it was necessary to make sure that tracks did not re-interact or decay before hitting the ToF-F wall. The efficiency of each scintillator bar was simply calculated as the number of tracks with hits in the ToF-F wall divided by the total number of selected tracks. Inefficiency was caused mainly by two effects. First, if two tracks hit a scintillator bar in the same event, the hit was discarded during reconstruction since it was not possible to distinguish between these tracks (close to the beamline there is a 4% probability another track will be matched to the same ToF-F hit, while this probability is below 1% further away from the beamline). Second, a hit is also discarded if the difference in time of flight measured by the top and bottom PMTs in a bar was larger than 2000 ps. During the data-taking period, four scintillator bars had only one PMT working or there was a DAQ problem for these channels. These scintillators did not suffer from the inefficiency caused by the quality cut during reconstruction. However, these bars had a worse time resolution by a factor of \u221a 2. The efficiency of each bar is shown in Fig. 16. Efficiency uncertainties were calculated as binomial errors. This information was then used to estimate the ToF-F efficiency for each phase space bin. Tracks in a single bin usually contain hits in several scintillators (usually around three or four). The error on the efficiency for each bin was taken as a ToF-F systematic uncertainty.",

However, such a drop was not seen in the MC simulation and could not be related to the ToF-F inefficiency. Under further inspection, it was discovered that the corresponding tracks actually did not reach the MTPCs but were bent out or absorbed while pass-ing very close to the edge of the magnetic field map used in the simulation. It is thus possible that the field map in this region is biased. It appears to be biased asymmetrically as negatively-charged tracks were more affected than positively-charged ones, pointing out to asymmetric E \u00d7 B corrections in the TPCs. Nevertheless, the affected bins represent only around 1% of the total \u03c0 \u00b1 bins and other hadrons were not affected, since they were not measured in the affected area because of the low statistics.

            "text": "(i) Hadron loss uncertainty. Apart from the ToF-F inefficiency, tracks can miss the ToF-F wall, re-interact in the detector, or decay before reaching the end of the MTPCs. Possible imperfections in the Monte Carlo description of the detector can create biases while correcting for the previously described effects. To check for potential biases, an attempt to impose more strict cuts and to select only tracks with a long segment in the MTPCs was made. After re-calculating and comparing the yields to the standard results, the difference was taken as a systematic uncertainty. In the majority of bins, this uncertainty is well below 1%. However, for tracks with a momentum of several GeV/c in the 20-40 mrad region in the most upstream longitudinal bin, the hadron loss uncertainty goes up to 20% (for a single bin it reached 50%). These tracks cross the beamline and pass very close to the walls of the MTPCs. (ii) Backward track extrapolation (bin migration) uncertainty. The uncertainty on the target position can induce systematic bin migration while extrapolating tracks backwards to the surface of the target. The position of the target was changed in the Monte Carlo and hadron yields were recalculated. Differences were taken as systematic uncertainties. For tracks with a very small angle originating from the first two longitudinal bins, this uncertainty goes up to 8%. Also, high angle tracks extrapolated toward the downstream face of the target are sensitive to the x and y shifts of the target, and for them the bin migration uncertainty is up to 5%. For all other regions of the phase space, the bin migration uncertainty drops below 1%. (iii) Reconstruction efficiency uncertainty. This uncertainty was estimated in the previous NA61/SHINE publications [8,10]. Since the experimental setup and the reconstruction software did not change, the same value was used for the measurements presented in this paper. A conservative value of 2% is assigned for all bins. (iv) Particle identification (PID) uncertainty. The width of the energy loss distribution for a single bin depends on the number of clusters in tracks. The energy loss distribution should be a sum of Gaussians, where each Gaussian represents tracks with a distinct number of clusters. Selected tracks, in this case, are very long and the width of the energy loss distribution becomes nearly constant. For this reason, a single Gaussian was used to describe the energy loss distributions. However, at higher momenta and, thus, for larger momentum bins, the mean values will also shift and possibly create an asymmetry in the distribution. To check for potential biases, a sum of two Gaussians was used and the obtained yields were compared. The mean values of Gaussians were kept independent, while the width of the second Gaussian was forced to be larger than the width of the first Gaussian. For low momentum, no difference was found, however, for higher momentum and larger bins, a difference of up to 1% was observed for \u03c0 \u00b1 and p. A constant value of 1% was assigned to all of these bins. Positively charged kaons are located under the proton peak in the energy loss distribution and the pion peak in the m 2 tof distribution for momentum larger than 3GeV/c. For this reason, the uncertainty for K + can reach 15% for the higher momentum bins. In case of K \u2212 , the obtained uncertainties are similar to the ones for K + . (v) Feed-down uncertainty. Produced K 0 s and \u039b in the target can decay before reaching the VTPC-1 and some of the daughter particles reconstructed in the TPCs can be extrapolated to the target surface. Since the correction for this effect is calculated with the Monte Carlo simulation, the number of produced K 0 s and \u039b is model dependent. A systematic uncertainty of 30% on the feed-down correction factor was assigned, following the standard approach in Refs. [8,10]. The systematic uncertainty is up to 2% for \u03c0 \u00b1 and protons. Mostly low momentum bins in the first and last longitudinal bins are affected. (vi) The ToF-F efficiency uncertainty. The uncertainty of the ToF-F efficiency was taken as a systematic uncertainty. It goes up to 2%, but for most of the bins it is well below 1%. (vii) Ad-hoc uncertainty. A constant conservative uncertainty of 25% was assigned to the bins that are corrected by the ad-hoc correction factor. The value was based on half the size of the typical ad hoc correction (50%).",

Since the beam profiles for the data taken in 2009 and 2010 are different, a direct comparison between the 2009 measurements and the measurements presented in this paper is not possible. The beam profile for the 2009 measurements is wider, and the 2009 pion yields are expected to be larger for the low angle upstream longitudinal bins. The differences decrease for more downstream longitudinal bins and higher angles. But even for the downstream face of the target and high angles (> 100 mrad) perfect agreement is not expected since Monte Carlo simulations show small differences in re-interactions for different beam profiles.

Since it was shown that this effect is mostly geometrical, there is the possibility that the reweighting factors are invariant under the beam profile change. To test this hypothesis, Fluka2011.2c.5 was used as input for data and the NuBeam physics list from Geant4.10.03 as input for the Monte Carlo. Around 40 \u00d7 10 6 protons on target were simulated for NA61/SHINE T 2 and T 3 beam profiles using both models. Re-weighting factors were calculated for both beam profiles and compared. Examples of the ratios for \u03c0 + and p are shown in Fig. 55. Some differences can be noticed for the upstream z bins, while for other bins any differences are mostly below 2%.

Yields of \u03c0 + and \u03c0 \u2212 were measured with improved precision compared to the previously published NA61/SHINE results, while K + , K \u2212 and p yields were obtained for the first time. These measurements are crucial for reducing the hadron production component of the T2K (anti)neutrino flux error, which is the dominant component in the flux uncertainty. Any reduction of the flux uncertainties will directly improve measurements of the (anti)neutrinonucleus cross sections as well as of the (anti)neutrino oscillation parameters in T2K. A simple method of using these results in T2K which avoids problems with the dependence on the incident proton beam profile is proposed. ",
