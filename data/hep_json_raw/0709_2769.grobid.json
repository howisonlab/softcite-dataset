The heavy SM particles in the loop can be replaced by new physics (NP) particles. Hence the corresponding physics observables may deviate from SM expectations. Recently, the possibility of time-dependent CP asymmetries in b \u2192 s\u03b3 from NP have drawn much theoretical and experimental interest [1,2,3,4].

As in b \u2192 s\u03b3, the photon emitted in b \u2192 d\u03b3 (b \u2192d\u03b3) is predominantly left-handed (right-handed), and hence the final state is flavor specific [1]. In the decay B 0 \u2192 \u03c1 0 \u03b3, the SM predicts no time-dependent CP asymmetry (S) and \u22120.1 for the direct CP asymmetry (A) [2,7]. In particular, assuming the top quark is the dominant contribution in the loop shown in Fig. 1, the decay amplitude has a weak phase \u03c6 1 that cancels the phase in the mixing; consequently S vanishes. Observing a non-zero value of S would indicate effects of NP [8]. In this Letter, we present the first measurements of S and A for the B 0 \u2192 \u03c1 0 (\u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 )\u03b3 transition based on 657 \u00d7 10 6 BB pairs collected with the Belle detector [9] at the KEKB asymmetric-energy e + e \u2212 (3.5 on 8.0 GeV) collider [10].",

The CP asymmetry in K * 0 \u03b3 has a direct impact on the measurement. Based on the fit result from the control sample, we vary A K * 0 \u03b3 from zero up to \u00b10.05, and find an error of 0.04 on A. The CP asymmetry in other BB backgrounds has less impact on the measurement. This asymmetry is varied by the weighted average of possible maximum CP asymmetries (\u00b11 if not measured) of contributing decay modes (0.06 on S, 0.09 on A); we find an error of 0.01 or less on both S and A. The uncertainty from the resolution function parameters is 0.06 on S and 0.07 on A. In addition to the above mentioned categories, we also take the following small sources of uncertainty into account: the uncertainty in the vertex reconstruction and flavor tagging, uncertainty due to the tag-side interference effect [20], uncertainty in the knowledge of the qq background \u2206t PDF, uncertainty in the physics parameters such as \u2206m d , \u03c4 B 0 , possible effect of correlations between M bc , \u2206E and M K\u03c0 and other possible biases.
