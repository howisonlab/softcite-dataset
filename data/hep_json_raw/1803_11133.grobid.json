The analysis uses proton-proton collision data collected in 2016 with the CMS detector at the LHC at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 . The transverse mass distribution of the charged lepton-neutrino system is used as the discriminating variable. No significant deviation from the standard model prediction is found. The best limit, from the combination of electron and muon channels, is 5.2 TeV at 95% confidence level for the mass of a W boson with the same couplings as those of the standard model W boson. Exclusion limits of 2.9 TeV are set on the inverse radius of the extra dimension in the framework of split universal extra dimensions. In addition, model-independent limits are set on the production cross section and coupling strength of W bosons decaying into this final state. An interpretation is also made in the context of an R parity violating supersymmetric model with a slepton as a mediator and flavor violating decay.",

Five decades of experimental studies have verified its predictions to very high precision. Despite the great success of the SM, theories beyond the SM (BSM) have been invoked to address a variety of open issues. Many SM extensions predict additional heavy gauge bosons, including models with extended gauge sectors [1], and theories with extra spatial dimensions [2,3].",

This quantity is measured using a particle-flow (PF) technique [33], that combines measurements from all components of the CMS detector in order to produce particle candidates. The modulus of the vector p T sum of these candidates defines p miss T , which is corrected for the jet energy calibration [34,35]. At high mass, the p miss T is mainly determined by the high-p T lepton in the event. Electrons are reconstructed as ECAL clusters that are matched to a central track and their identification has been optimized for high-p T values [36]. Electron candidates are required to be isolated, have an electron-like shape, and be within the acceptance region of the barrel (|\u03b7| < 1.44) or the endcaps (1.56 < |\u03b7| < 2.50). This acceptance region avoids the transition region between barrel and endcap parts of the ECAL. Electron isolation in the tracker is ensured by requiring the sum of p T to be less than 5 GeV for all tracks that are in close proximity to the track of the electron candidate and to originate from the same primary vertex. Only tracks that are within a cone of \u2206R = \u221a (\u2206\u03c6) 2 + (\u2206\u03b7) 2 < 0.3 around the electron candidate's track are considered. The reconstructed vertex with the largest value of summed physics-object p 2 T is taken to be the primary pp interaction vertex. The physics objects are the jets, clustered using the jet finding algorithm [15,16] with the tracks assigned to the vertex as inputs, and the associated missing transverse momentum, taken as the negative vector sum of the p T of those jets. As in the tracker isolation calculation, in the calorimeters the sum of energy deposits within a cone \u2206R < 0.3 around the electron candidate's direction is used as a measure of isolation. It is corrected for the mean energy contribution from additional pp collisions occurring within the same bunch crossing (pileup) [37]. To obtain sufficiently isolated electrons, this calorimeter isolation is required to be below a threshold of 3% of the electron's transverse momentum. Additionally, the energy deposits in the hadron calorimeter within a cone of \u2206R = 0.15 around the electron's direction must be less than 5% of the electron's energy deposit in the ECAL. In order to differentiate between electrons and photons, properties of the track matched to the calorimeter measurement must be consistent with those of an electron originating from the primary vertex. Specifically, there must be \u22641 hit missing in the innermost tracker layers, and the transverse distance to the primary vertex must be <0.02 cm (barrel) or <0.05 cm (endcap).",

Since segments are typically in consecutive layers separated JHEP06 (2018)128by thick layers of steel, the latter requirement significantly reduces the amount of hadronic punch-through [38]. To reduce background from cosmic ray muons, each muon is required to have a transverse impact parameter of less than 0.02 cm and a longitudinal distance parameter of less than 0.5 cm with respect to the primary vertex. In order to suppress muons with mismeasured p T , an additional requirement \u03c3 p T /p T < 0.3 is applied, where \u03c3 p T is the p T uncertainty from the muon track reconstruction.

Events with a second lepton with p T > 25 GeV are rejected. In the electron channel, p miss T is required to be above 150 GeV to avoid the mismodeled low-p miss Tregion. In the muon channel, the contribution from tt events is further reduced by rejecting events containing six or more jets or events with the leading jet having p T > 25 GeV",
