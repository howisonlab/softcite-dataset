Exchange of quasi-real photons is selected by isolating the sharp Coulomb peak observed at smallest momentum transfers, t < 0.001 GeV 2 /c 2 . Using partial-wave analysis techniques, the scattering intensity of Coulomb production described in terms of chiral dynamics and its dependence on the 3\u03c0-invariant mass m 3\u03c0 = \u221a s were extracted. The absolute cross section was determined in seven bins of \u221a s with an overall precision of 20%. At leading order, the result is found to be in good agreement with the prediction of chiral perturbation theory over the whole energy range investigated.",

The trigger selected events with at least two outgoing charged particles at scattering angles less than about 50 mrad. In the data analysis, exactly three outgoing charged particles, assumed to be pions, were required to form with the incoming beam particle a vertex that is consistent with an interaction within the target volume. Neglecting the tiny target nucleus recoil at low t , their energy sum E 3\u03c0 equals the beam energy for the exclusive \u03c0 \u2212 Pb\u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + Pb reaction. Taking into account the spread of the beam energy, \u03c3 beam \u2248 1.3 GeV, E 3\u03c0 is required to lie within \u00b14 GeV around the mean beam energy. Figure 2 shows the m 3\u03c0 distribution with the requirement t < 0.001 GeV 2 /c 2 , i.e. the Primakoff-t region.

For M= 1, the exact shape expected for photon exchange can not be resolved experimentally since it is distorted by multiple scattering and detector resolution. The resulting spectrum is well described by an exp (\u2212b t ) function, where the theoretically \"forbidden\" forward region at t \u2192 0 is filled by multiple scattering. The slope fitted to the ChPT intensity shown in Fig. 5, b = 1447 \u00b1 196 (GeV/c) \u22122 , is in good agreement with the simulation of pure photon exchange, b sim \u2248 1600 (GeV/c) \u22122 . Strong interaction M= 1 exchange, on the other hand, would have a slowly rising \u221d t exp (\u2212bt ) distribution. From additional studies performed for the neighboring t region, 0.001 < t < 0.01 GeV 2 /c 2 , strong interaction M= 1 contributions to the Primakoff region were estimated to be well below 5%.",

Fitting the chiral amplitude as M= 1 contribution leads to smaller statistical uncertainties due to the smaller number of free parameters, while it features a signal strength compatible with that of the sum of the M= 1 waves in the isobaric description. The PWA attributes a comparable likelihood to both cases, which reflects that the real event distribution in the 5-dimensional phase space follows equivalently well the distributions expected from the two ans\u00e4tze. But, the observed enhancement of M= 1 waves at small t lacks a theoretical explanation other than its chiral nature, and the comparison to the fit with isobaric waves is presented here only as a well-known starting point of the employed PWA.",

As partial waves are also identified by their signature in the remaining 4 kinematical variables that are not distorted by resolution effects in the t \u2192 0 limit, the two reflectivity contributions have been summed up and attributed to the well-motivated and expected M \u03b5 = 1 + intensities.

While the latter is known to high precision, the effective beam flux is influenced by a variety of effects which are less well controlled. The beam intensity was not monitored with high precision, and absolute trigger and detection efficiencies have to be modeled. The method employed here to overcome these uncertainties is based on the free decay of the kaon component in the beam [10]. As can be seen in Fig. 2, the observed 3pion final state contains a contribution from kaon decays K \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + . Since the fraction of kaons in the beam and their decay kinematics are known to a much better precision than the statistical uncertainty, the observed kaon strength was used to determine the effective luminosity. Uncertainties in the Monte Carlo description of the experimental setup cancel out, since they affect the K \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + decay and the \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b3 \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + reaction in a similar way.  In Fig. 6 the real-photon absolute cross section is shown. It has been obtained by taking into account the effective luminosity for the chiral amplitude and dividing out the quasi-real photon density factor as given in Eq. (1). A good agreement with the leading order ChPT prediction [1] is observed. This is expected since in ChPT loop effects and resonances are supposed to become important only at higher masses [7].",
