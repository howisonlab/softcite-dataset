We find an excess of \u039b's (\u039b's) produced in the proton (antiproton) direction. This forward-backward asymmetry is measured as a function of rapidity. We confirm that the\u039b/\u039b production ratio, measured by several experiments with various targets and a wide range of energies, is a universal function of \"rapidity loss\", i.e., the rapidity difference of the beam proton and the lambda.",

In this paper we examine the question of whether the \u039b and\u039b retain some memory of the proton and antiproton beam directions. We consider the picture in which a strange quark produced directly in the hard scattering of point-like partons, or indirectly in the subsequent showering, can coalesce with a diquark remnant of the beam to produce a lambda particle, with the probability increasing with decreasing rapidity difference between the proton and the lambda [1][2][3][4].",

Data set (i) is collected with a prescaled trigger on beam crossing (\"zero bias events\") or with a prescaled trigger on energy deposited in forward luminosity counters (\"minimum bias events\"). Data set (ii) is selected with a suite of single muon, dimuon, and dedicated J/\u03c8 triggers, from which J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 candidates in association with a \u039b or\u039b are reconstructed. Data set (iii) is selected with a suite of single muon triggers, and a \u00b5 and a \u039b are fully reconstructed offline. Data set (i) is unbiased, while most events in data sets (ii) and (iii) contain heavy quarks b or c [10,11]. Data set (iii) has the same muon triggers and muon selections as in Refs. [10,11].

Each track is required to have a non-zero impact parameter in the transverse plane (IP) with respect to the primary pp vertex with a significance of at least two standard deviations, and the V 0 projected to its point of closest approach is required to have an IP significance less than three standard deviations. The distance in the transverse plane from the primary pp vertex to the V 0 vertex is required to be greater than 4 mm. The V 0 is required to have 2.0 < p T < 25 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.2. For \u039b's and\u039b's, the proton (pion) mass is assigned to the daughter track with larger (smaller) momentum. This assignment is nearly always correct because the decay \u039b \u2192 p\u03c0 \u2212 is barely above threshold. We require that the V 0 daughter tracks not be identified as a muon. An example of an invariant mass distribution M (\u039b \u2192 p\u03c0 \u2212 ) is presented in Fig. 1. The D0 detector |y| acceptance is narrower than the lambda production rapidity plateau as shown in Fig. 2  Control samples with K S are analyzed in the same manner as the corresponding sets with \u039b or\u039b, except that the track with larger momentum is assigned the pion mass instead of the proton mass. Note that we count the decays K S \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and K S \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + separately, where the first pion has the larger total momentum. This way the former decay has kinematics similar to \u039b decays, while the latter is similar to\u039b decays. The pp collisions produce K 0 's andK 0 's that we observe as resonances in invariant mass distributions of K S \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decays. Since this final state does not distinguish the parent K 0 fromK 0 (neglecting CP violation), K S decays do not distinguish the p andp directions, have no physics asymmetries, and so constitute a control sample to study detector effects.",

The solenoid and toroid magnet polarities are reversed approximately every two weeks during data taking so that at each of the four solenoid-toroid polarity combinations approximately the same number of events are collected. The raw asymmetries obtained with each magnet polarity show variations of up to \u00b10.004 for A \u2032 F B , \u00b10.008 for A \u2032 N S , and \u00b10.003 for A \u2032 \u039b\u039b .

Assume that, due to some detector geometric effect, the former event has a larger acceptance times efficiency than the latter event for a given solenoid and toroid polarity.

We expect the asymmetries A \u2032 F B (K S ) and A \u2032 \u039b\u039b (K S ) to be zero, while A \u2032 N S (K S ) is not necessarily zero.

This asymmetry is different from zero as expected from the different inelastic crosssections of p andp, and of \u039b and\u039b, with the detector material. The asymmetries in Fig. 4 were obtained from Eqs. (3) but neglecting the quadratic terms. Therefore the forward-backward asymmetries shown in Fig. 4 need corrections A \u2032 N S A \u2032 \u039b\u039b due to detector effects. These corrections, obtained bin-by-bin from Fig. 4 (b) and (c), are measured to be consistent with zero within their statistical uncertainties.

            "text": "We have measured the forward-backward asymmetry of \u039b and\u039b production A F B as a function of rapidity |y| for three data sets: pp \u2192 \u039b(\u039b)X, pp \u2192 J/\u03c8\u039b(\u039b)X, and pp \u2192 \u00b5 \u00b1 \u039b(\u039b)X. The asymmetry A F B is a function of |y| that does not depend significantly on the data set or data composition (see Fig. 12), and is weakly dependent on p T (see Fig. 11). The measurement of A F B in pp collisions can be compared with the\u039b/\u039b production ratio mea- sured by a wide range of proton scattering experiments. This production ratio is confirmed to be approximately a universal function of the \"rapidity loss\" y p \u2212 y, that does not depend significantly (or depends only weakly) on the total center of mass energy \u221a s or target (see Figs. 6 and 7). This result supports the view that a strange quark produced directly in the hard scattering of pointlike partons, or indirectly in the subsequent showering, can coalesce with a diquark remnant of the beam particle to produce a lambda with a probability that increases as the rapidity difference between the proton and lambda decreases.
