The contribution of hard double-parton scattering to the production of four-jet events is extracted using an artificial neural network, assuming that hard double-parton scattering can be approximated by an uncorrelated overlaying of dijet events. For events containing at least four jets with transverse momentum p T \u2265 20 GeV and pseudorapidity |\u03b7| \u2264 4.4, and at least one having p T \u2265 42.5 GeV, the contribution of hard double-parton scattering is estimated to be f DPS = 0.092 +0.005   \u22120.011 (stat.) +0.033 \u22120.037 (syst.). After combining this measurement with those of the inclusive dijet and four-jet cross-sections in the appropriate phase space regions, the effective cross-section, \u03c3 eff , was determined to be \u03c3 eff = 14.9 +1.2 \u22121.0 (stat.) +5.1 \u22123.8 (syst.) mb. This result is consistent within the quoted uncertainties with previous measurements of \u03c3 eff , performed at centre-of-mass energies between 63 GeV and 8 TeV using various final states, and it corresponds to 21 +7 \u22126 % of the total inelastic cross-section measured at \u221a s = 7 TeV. The distributions of the observables sensitive to the contribution of hard double-parton scattering, corrected for detector effects, are also provided.",

These first studies were followed by the generalization of the Altarelli-Parisi evolution equations to the case of multi-parton states in refs. [4,5] and a discussion of possible correlations in the colour and spin degrees of freedom of the incident partons [6]. In the first phenomenological studies of such effects, the most prominent role was played by processes known as double-parton scattering (DPS), which is the simplest case of multi-parton interactions (MPI), leading to",

These studies have been supplemented by experimental measurements of DPS effects in hadron collisions at different centre-of-mass energies, which now range over two orders of magnitude, from 63 GeV to 8 TeV [16][17][18][19][20][21][22][23][24][25][26][27][28][29][30], and which have firmly established the existence of this mechanism. The abundance of MPI phenomena at the LHC and their importance for the full picture of hadronic collisions have reignited the phenomenological interest in DPS and have led to a deepening of its theoretical understanding [31][32][33][34][35][36][37][38][39]. Despite this progress, quantitative measurements of the effect of DPS on distributions of observables sensitive to it are affected by large systematic uncertainties. This is a clear indication of the experimental challenges and of the complexity of the analysis related to such measurements. Therefore, the cross-section of DPS continues to be estimated by ignoring the likely existence of complicated correlation effects. For a process in which a final state A + B is produced at a hadronic centre-of-mass energy \u221a s, the simplified formalism of refs. [12,13]  The quantity \u03b4 AB is the Kronecker delta used to construct a symmetry factor such that for identical final states with identical phase space, the DPS cross-section is divided by two. The \u03c3 eff , usually referred to as the effective cross-section, is a purely phenomenological parameter describing the effective overlap of the spatial distribution of partons in the plane perpendicular to the direction of motion. In hadronic collisions it was typically found to range between 10 and 25 mb [16][17][18][19][20][21][22][23][24][25][26][27][28][29][30]. In eq. (1.1), the various\u03c3 are the parton-level crosssections, either for the DPS events, indicated by the subscript A + B, or for the production of a final state A or B in a single parton scatter (SPS), given by",

In one of the first studies of DPS in four-jet production at hadron colliders [10] the kinematic configuration in which there is a pairwise balance of the transverse momenta (p T ) of the jets was identified as increasing the contribution of the DPS mechanism relative to the perturbative QCD production of four jets in SPS. The idea is that in typical 2 \u2192 2 scattering processes the two outgoing particles -here the partons identified as jets -are oriented back-to-back in transverse plane such that their net transverse momentum is zero. Corrections to this simple picture include initial-and final-state radiation as well as fragmentation and hadronization. In addition, recoil against the underlying event can modify the four-momentum of the overall final-state particle configuration. In attempting to describe all of these features, Monte Carlo (MC) event generators form an integral part, providing a link between the experimentally observed jets and the simple partonic picture of DPS as two almost independent 2 \u2192 2 scatters.",

The DPS model contributes in two ways to the production of events with at least four jets, leading to two separate event classifications. In one contribution, the secondary scatter produces two of the four leading jets in the event; such events are classified as complete-DPS (cDPS). In the second contribution of DPS to four-jet production, three of the four leading jets are produced in the hardest scatter, and the fourth jet is produced in the secondary scatter; such events are classified as semi-DPS (sDPS). The DPS fraction is therefore rewritten as f DPS = f cDPS + f sDPS , and f cDPS and f sDPS are both determined from data. The dijet cross-sections in eq.

A full description of the jet energy calibration is given in ref. [64]. For the MC samples, particle jets were built from particles with a lifetime longer than 30 ps in the Monte Carlo event record, excluding muons and neutrinos. For the purpose of measuring \u03c3 eff in the four-jet final state, three samples of events were selected, two dijet samples and one four-jet sample. The former two samples have at least two, and the latter at least four, jets in the final state, where each jet was required to have p T \u2265 20 GeV and |\u03b7| \u2264 4.4. In each event, jets were sorted in decreasing order of their transverse momenta. The transverse momentum of the i th jet is denoted by p i T and the jet with the highest p T (p 1 T ) is referred to as the leading jet. To ensure 100% trigger efficiency, the leading jet in four-jet events was required to have p 1 T \u2265 42.5 GeV. The selection requirements for the dijet samples were dictated by those used to select four-jet events. In one class of dijet events, the requirement on the transverse momentum of the leading jet must be equivalent to the requirement on the leading jet in four-jet events, p 1 T \u2265 42.5 GeV. The other type of dijet event corresponds to the sub-leading pair of jets in the four-jet event, with a requirement of p T \u2265 20 GeV. In the following, the cross-section for dijets selected with p 1 T \u2265 20 GeV is denoted by \u03c3 A 2j and the cross-section for dijets with p 1 T \u2265 42.5 GeV is denoted by \u03c3 B 2j . To summarize, the measurement was performed using the dijet A sample and its two subsamples (dijet B and four-jet), selected using the following requirements: 1) where N jet denotes the number of reconstructed jets. All of the selected events were corrected for jet reconstruction and trigger inefficiencies, the corrections ranging from 2%-4% for low-p T jets to less than 1% for jets with p T \u2265 60 GeV. The observed distributions of the p T and y of the four leading jets in the events are shown in figures 1(a) and 1(b) respectively.",

In order to test that the discrepancies are not from mis-modelling of SPS in AHJ, the \u2206 p T 34 and \u2206\u03c6 34 distributions in the SPS sample extracted from AHJ were compared to the distributions in the SPS sample generated in Sherpa. Good agreement between the shapes of the distributions was observed for both variables. This and further studies indicate that the excess of events   with jets 3 and 4 in the back-to-back topology is due to an excess of DPS events in the AHJ sample compared to the data.",

An extensive comparison between the distributions of the variables used as input to the NN in the overlay samples and in AHJ was performed and good agreement was observed. This can be summarized by comparing the NN output distributions. The NN is applied to the cDPS and sDPS samples extracted from AHJ and the  output distributions are compared to the output distributions in the corresponding samples constructed by overlaying events selected from data. Normalized distributions of the projection of the full ternary plot on the horizontal axis are shown in figures 5(a) and 5(b) for the cDPS and sDPS samples respectively. Good agreement is observed between the distributions. Based on these results, it is concluded that the topology of the four jets in the overlaid events is comparable to that of the four leading jets in DPS events extracted from AHJ. The added advantage of using overlaid events from data to construct the DPS samples is that the jets are at the same JES as the jets in four-jet events in data, leading to a smaller systematic uncertainty in the final result.",

These matrices were derived using samples of four-jet events selected from the AHJ and Pythia6 samples by imposing the cuts detailed in eq. (5.1) on particle jets. The AHJ sample generated with the AUET1 tune was used to derive the unfolding matrix. The distributions were unfolded with the Bayesian unfolding algorithm, implemented in the RooUnfold package [74], using two iterations. The unfolding matrices derived from AHJ were taken as the nominal matrices and the differences observed when using the matrices derived from Pythia6 were used as an additional systematic uncertainty, typically of the order of a few percent in each bin. The total systematic uncertainty of the differential distributions in data was obtained by summing in quadrature the uncertainty due to MC modelling in a given bin with the systematic uncertainties in this bin due to the JES and jet energy and angular resolution uncertainties, while preserving correlations between bins. Figure 10 shows the normalized differential cross-section distribution in data for the \u2206 p T 34 and \u2206\u03c6 34 variables compared to the particle-level distributions in the AHJ samples generated with the AUET1 and AUET2 tunes. The particle-level distributions in the AUET2 AHJ sample overestimate the normalized differential cross-section distributions in data in the regions \u2206 p T 34 \u2264 0.15 and \u2206\u03c6 34 \u2265 2.8, demonstrating the excess of the DPS contribution in this sample compared to the data. On the other hand, the DPS contribution in the data is underestimated by -21 - the prediction obtained with the AUET1 tune. These comparisons demonstrate the power of these distributions to constrain MPI models and tunes. In section A, the normalized differential cross-sections in data for the remaining variables are compared to the particlelevel distributions in the AHJ samples generated using the AUET1 and AUET2 tunes.",
