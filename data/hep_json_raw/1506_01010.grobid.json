The combination of this result with other CMS searches for the Higgs boson decaying to a b-quark pair yields a signal strength of 1.0 AE 0.4, corresponding to a signal significance of 2.6 standard deviations for a Higgs boson mass of 125 GeV.",

The mechanism predicts the existence of a scalar Higgs boson (H), and its observation was one of the main goals of the CERN LHC program. A boson with mass near 125 GeV was recently discovered by both the ATLAS [7] and CMS [8,9] collaborations, with properties that are compatible with those of a SM Higgs boson [10,11].",

Two jets are expected to originate from a light-quark pair (u or d), which are typically two valence quarks from each of the colliding protons scattered away from the beam line in the VBF process. These \"VBF-tagging\" jets are expected to be roughly in the forward and backward directions relative to the beam direction. Two additional jets are expected from the Higgs boson decay to a bb pair in more central regions of the detector. Another important property of the signal events is that, being produced through an electroweak process, no quantum chromodynamics (QCD) color is exchanged at leading order in the production. As a result, in the most probable color evolution of these events, the VBF-tagging jets connect to the proton remnants in the forward and backward beam line directions, while the two b-quark jets connect to each other as decay products of the color neutral Higgs boson. Consequently very little additional QCD radiation and hadronic activity is expected in the space outside the color-connected regions, in particular in the whole rapidity interval (rapidity gap) between the two VBF-tagging jets, with the exception of the Higgs boson decay products.",

Then, a more general trigger was employed for the larger part of the 2012 data taking that targeted VBF signatures in general. The first (nominal) set of triggers collected the larger fraction of the signal events, while the second trigger supplemented the search with events that failed the stringent nominal-trigger requirements.

A refined calibration is carried out for individual b jets, beyond the default jet energy corrections, that takes into account the jet composition properties and targets semileptonic b decays that lead to a substantial mismeasurement of the jet p T due to the presence of an escaping neutrino. For this purpose a regression BDT is trained on simulated signal events with inputs including information about the jet properties and structure. The target of the regression is the p T of the associated particle-level jet, clustered from all stable particles (with lifetime c\u03c4 > 1 cm). The inputs include (i) the jet p T , \u03b7, and mass; (ii) the jet energy fractions carried by neutral hadrons and photons [34][35][36]; (iii) the mass and the uncertainty in the decay length associated with the secondary vertex, when present; (iv) the event missing transverse energy and its azimuthal direction relative to the jet; (v) the total number of jet constituents; (vi) the p T of the soft-lepton candidate inside the jet, when present, and its p T component perpendicular to the jet axis; (vii) the p T of the leading track in the jet; and (viii) the average p T density of the event in y-\u03d5 space (FASTJET \u03c1 method [42]).",

First, events are selected from set A, with the additional requirement to have at least one CSVM jet. It should be noted that it is important to extract the Z boson signal in the same four-jet phase space in which the Higgs boson search is performed. Then, a multivariate discriminant is trained to separate the Z \u00fe jets process from the QCD multijet production, using variables that are only weakly correlated to m bb . According to the value of the discriminant the events are divided into three categories, ranging from a signal-depleted control category, to a signalenriched one. Finally, a simultaneous fit of the signal and the QCD background m bb shape is performed in all three categories. The subsequent sections give details of the outlined procedure.",

A residual uncertainty from these sources is estimated for the particular kinematical phase space of the search: following the PDF4LHC prescription [53,54] the PDF and \u03b1 S uncertainty ranges from 2% to 5%, while the renormalization and factorization scale variations in the signal simulation induce an uncertainty of 1% to 5% in the analysis categories, on top of a global cross section uncertainty of 0.2% (VBF) and 7.7-8.1% (GF). Finally, the variation of the UE and parton-shower (PS) model (using PYTHIA 8.1 [55] instead of the default PYTHIA 6) affects the signal acceptance by 2% to 7% (VBF) and by 10% to 45% (GF).",

Event selection overlaps between different analyses have been checked and are either empty by construction or have negligible effects on the combination. The combination methodology is based on the likelihood ratio test statistics employed in Sec. XI, and takes into account correlations among sources of systematic uncertainty. Care is taken to understand the behavior of the parameters that are correlated between analyses, in terms of the fitted parameter values and uncertainties. Table V lists the 95% CL expected and observed upper limits and the best-fit signal strength values from the individual channels and from the combined fit.
