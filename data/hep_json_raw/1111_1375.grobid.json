This represents a statistics increase of 52% over the result published in 2010. The data favor LSND-like oscillations over a background-only hypothesis at the 91.1% confidence level. While the new result remains equally consistent with LSND, the compatibility with the background-only hypothesis is improved. An excess of 38.6 \u00b1 18.5 \u03bd e -like events below 475 MeV is observed, consistent with the observation of such an excess in neutrino mode.",

            "text": "The MiniBooNE experiment (E898/944) at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory is a short-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment whose main purpose is to test the LSND oscillation results [1]. MiniBooNE uses an 8 GeV proton beam from the Fermilab Booster to produce pions, which then decay in flight to produce a nearly pure \u03bd \u00b5 flux at a mineral oil Cherenkov detector 500 m away. The detector uses Cherenkov ring shape information to distinguish charged-current \u03bd \u00b5 (\u03bd \u00b5 ) from \u03bd e (\u03bd e ) interactions, searching for an excess of \u03bd e which would indicate oscillations. Data collection began in late 2002 with the beam configured to produce neutrinos; since 2007 most operations have been with the focusing polarity reversed to produce antineutrinos. Antineutrino studies are important for a complete test of LSND, which was primarily a\u03bd \u00b5 \u2192\u03bd e search.",

The most significant change is an improved constraint on kaondecay \u03bd e in the beam from the SciBooNE experiment [5], reducing the prediction for that background source by 3% and its error by a factor of three. Detector and beam monitoring have indicated no significant changes over the entire run period, and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests of neutrino control samples are consistent with a constant event rate. The reconstructed energy distribution of\u03bd e candidates is shown in Fig. 1a. In the augmented data set, 168 events are observed in the 475-1250 MeV region, corresponding to an excess of 16.3 \u00b1 19.4 over predicted background. The excess in this region is thus reduced when the new data are added.",
