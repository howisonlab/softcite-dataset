The data sample used corresponds to an integrated luminosity of approximately 4 fb \u22121 of pp collisions at \u221a s = 1.96 TeV recorded by the CDF II experiment. This search includes twice the integrated luminosity of the previous published result, uses analysis techniques to distinguish jets originating from light flavor quarks and those from gluon radiation, and adds sensitivity to a Higgs boson produced by vector boson fusion. We find no evidence of the Higgs boson and place limits on the Higgs boson production cross section for Higgs boson masses between 100 GeV/c 2 and 150 GeV/c 2 at the 95% confidence level. For a Higgs boson mass of 120 GeV/c 2 the observed (expected) limit is 10.5 (20.0) times the predicted Standard Model cross section.",

Low-mass Higgs boson searches at CDF have concentrated on signatures that are a combination of jets, leptons and missing transverse energy which help to reduce the backgrounds but the signal yields are small [9][10][11]. The hadronic modes used in this search exploit the larger branching fraction and thus have the largest signal yields among all the search channels at CDF. The major challenge for this search is the modeling and suppression of the large background from QCD multijets (referred to as QCD for brevity).",

The new trigger improved the acceptance for a low-mass Higgs boson by 45% at Higgs mass of 100 GeV/c 2 and by 20% at Higgs mass of 150 GeV/c 2 . The improvement was mainly due to lowering the total E T criteria in the new trigger. However the gain in the signal acceptance of the new trigger was diminished after the event selection criteria which are described in the next section.",

The VH channel has two mass resonances: m bb from the Higgs boson decay and m qq from the V decay. The VBF channel shares the same m bb Higgs boson mass resonance but there is no accompanying resonance for m qq . The q jets in VBF tend to have a large \u03b7 separation which results in larger values of m qq . The cut of m qq > 120 GeV/c 2 optimizes the VBF signal over background ratio. The acceptance for VH and VBF events varies from 2% to 3% for 100 GeV/c 2 < m H < 150 GeV/c 2 .

The TRF is applied to a QCD dominated data sample of events with at least one SecVtx b-tagged jet (singletagged events) to predict the distribution of events with exactly two b-tagged jets (double-tagged events). For each single-tagged event, the TRF gives the probability of each additional jet, called a probe jet, to be a second b-tagged jet. The TRF is parameterized as a function of three variables: the E T and \u03b7 of the probe jet and \u2206R between the tagged b jet and probe jet. The choice of variables used to parameterize the TRF is motivated by the kinematics of the QCD background and the characteristics of the b-tagging algorithms. As the behavior of the SecVtx and JetProb b-tagging algorithms are not identical, there is a TRF for SS and another TRF for SJ. The TRF is measured using jets in the Tag region (Fig. 1), defined as m qq < 45 GeV/c 2 , m bb < 50 GeV/c 2 and m bb > 200 GeV/c 2 which is not in the VH and VBF signal regions.",

An alternative TRF was measured using events in the Control region, as indicated in Fig. 1, which is still backgrounddominated. The interpolation uncertainty is defined as the difference of the QCD NN shapes using the nominal Tag TRF and Control TRF. The correction function uncertainty for m qq is evaluated by deriving an alternative correction function for m qq using events from the control region. This alternative m qq correction function is applied to the TRF, instead of the nominal m qq correction function, and propagated through the NN. The difference in the QCD NN shape between using the nominal correction function and the Control region derived function defines the correction function shape uncertainty. The systematic uncertainty for \u03c6 , and \u03b7 correction functions is evaluated in the same way. The QCD NN output varied at most by \u223c 2 \u2212 3% for each QCD shape systematic.

The combined channel limits for Higgs boson masses in the range between 100 -150 GeV/c 2 are shown in Fig. 6 and summarized in Table III. The observed limits for the individual search channels agree within 1\u03c3 of their expected limit except for the VH-SS channel where we see a 2\u03c3 discrepancy. The observed data in the VH-SS channel have a deficit in the high signal region of the NN. Since the VH-SS channel is the most sensitive, it has the strongest influence on the combined limit; thus the deviation of the observed limit from the expected limit in the VH-SS channel is similar to that of the combined limit. Figure 7 shows the ratio of the data to the expected background for the four analysis channels for the NN trained on a 120 GeV/c 2 Higgs boson. All four channels show a ratio \u2248 1 over the whole NN output range but the VH-SS channel has several points with a ratio of \u2248 0.9 at the NN output of \u223c 0.5; the most sensitive region of the NN output where the Higgs signal peaks. If the background was mismodeled, either the TRF has incorrectly predicted the QCD background or the NN was at fault. The VH-SS and VBF-SS chan-",
