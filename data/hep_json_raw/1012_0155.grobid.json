In the QCD parton model half of these asymmetries can be interpreted within the leading order approach and the other four are twist-three contributions. The first two leading twist asymmetries extracted by HERMES and COMPASS experiments are related: one to the transversity distribution and the Collins effect, the other to the Sivers distribution function. These results triggered a lot of interest in the past few years and allowed the first extractions of the transversity and the Sivers distribution functions of nucleon. The remaining six asymmetries were obtained by the COMPASS experiment using a 160 GeV/c longitudinally polarized muon beam and transversely polarized deuteron and proton targets. Here we review preliminary results from COMPASS proton data of 2007.",

The asymmetries for positive and negative hadrons are plotted as a function of x, z, P hT and W . The systematic uncertainties have been estimated separately for each asymmetry for positive and negative hadrons and are given by the bands. Next, figures 3 and 4 show the x-dependence of the calculated for COMPASS kinematical region asymmetries from [15], [17] and [18] together with the COMPASS measured values. In figure 3 we show only SSAs for positive and negative hadrons, while figure 4 is dedicated to DSAs. One can see that at maximum UT asymmetries are predicted to be of order of 1 \u2212 2% and LTs around 5 \u2212 10% and that the theoretical curves basically stay within the error bands showing an agreement with COMPASS measurements at this level of the statistical accuracy.

            "text": "We have presented preliminary results for six new target transverse spin dependent asymmetries extracted from COMPASS 2007 data collected on a proton target. These measurement together with the published Collins and Sivers TSAs on proton and with our deuteron measurements complete the whole set of eight azimuthal asymmetries allowed in SIDIS and give another access to the studies of TMD DFs and FFs. Obviously, presented comparison plots for different theory predictions show that the statistical accuracy has yet to be enhanced to draw some decisive conclusions. However, in 2010 COMPASS collected a new large sample of data with transversely polarized proton target, and we look forward to significantly improve the precision of our results.",
