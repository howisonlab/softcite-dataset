Charged jets of transverse momentum p ch T, jet in three regions 5-10, 10-15, 15-20 GeV/c are studied separately. The uncorrected differential yields of \u03c0, K and p in the jets are extracted using the TPC dE/dx information. The results are corrected for detectors effects, including tracking efficiency, track p T resolution, jet p T resolution, secondary particle and muon (fake pion) contamination.

It determines the raw differential particle yields in p T from 0.15 GeV/c to above 20 GeV/c with an accuracy on average better than 10% for the ALICE data in pp collisions. This method is based on the observation that the mean and width of the dE/dx distribution as well as the fractions of different particle species are all continuous functions of the particle momentum. Using models of dE/dx distributions, denoted as s k (p; \u03b8) with a set of a priori unknown parameters \u03b8, for particle species k as a function of the particle momentum, a log-likelihood function l is built with additional parameters f ki for the fraction of species k at momentum bin i.

The parameters \u03b8 and f ki are determined using the maximum likelihood estimation with the full log-likelihood function Eq. 2 from the dE/dx vs. p distribution. This single optimisation procedure drives coherently the full-range constraint on the dE/dx models as well as the constraint on the particle fractions, performing the calibration of dE/dx and the particle yield extraction simultaneously. The challenge in PID using dE/dx at high particle momentum (p > 4 GeV/c) is that the particle fractions are very sensitive to the mean of the dE/dx distribution. For the ALICE pp collision data, the K-p separation is about 5% at high momentum, and consequently a 1 dE/dx bias can induce a 2% bias in the particle fraction. Extensive examination of the systematics in the TPC Coherent Fit has therefore been performed, including the dE/dx model uncertainties, the stability against the change of the dE/dx quality, the possible particle species dependence of dE/dx (which turns out to be negligible), and mostly critically, the jet p T dependence of dE/dx which is caused by an enhanced track density in jets 3 . The last source of systematics is specific to this analysis with respect to the general case of the identified particle production in inclusive MB data sample. The TPC Coherent Fit performs the dE/dx calibration for different p ch T, jet data samples separately and it was found that in these jet p T regions the dE/dx increases by 0.3% per 5 GeV/c p ch T, jet increase. Because with the TPC Coherent Fit the dE/dx parameters are automatically adjusted for each p ch T, jet sample, no error arises from this effect. As a further verification of the systematic errors, the method is applied in an identical way also to Monte Carlo (MC) samples (PYTHIA [9] Perugia0 [10] tune) with the full ALICE detector simulation and reconstruction. As is shown in Fig. 1 (left), the uncorrected K/\u03c0 ratio extracted by the TPC Coherent Fit from the MC sample is consistent with the detector level MC truth. In the same figure, the uncorrected ratio from data is also shown; it can be seen that MC deviates from the data beyond the systematic errors.",

PYTHIA describes the p T -spectra better at large p ch T, jet for high p T particles. The best agreement is obtained for kaons while PYTHIA undershoots (overshoots) low p T pions (protons). The data are reproduced in general within 30% accuracy except for the low p T protons for which the deviation goes up beyond 100% at around 0.4 GeV/c. In addition, PYTHIA reproduces the maxima of the proton spectra but fails to describe the width and the high p T slope.
