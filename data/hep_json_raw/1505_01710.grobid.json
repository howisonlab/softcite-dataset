In this study a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3.0 fb \u22121 of pp collisions collected by the LHCb detector is used. The branching fraction of the B 0 \u2192D 0 \u03c0 \u00fe \u03c0 \u2212 decay in the region m\u00f0D 0 \u03c0 AE \u00de > 2.1 GeV=c 2 is measured to be \u00f08.46 AE 0.14 AE 0.29 AE 0.40\u00de \u00d7 10 \u22124 , where the first uncertainty is statistical, the second is systematic and the last arises from the normalization channel B 0 \u2192 D \u00c3 \u00f02010\u00de \u2212 \u03c0 \u00fe . The \u03c0 \u00fe \u03c0 \u2212 S-wave components are modeled with the isobar and K-matrix formalisms. Results of the Dalitz plot analyses using both models are presented. A resonant structure at m\u00f0D 0 \u03c0 \u2212 \u00de \u2248 2.8 GeV=c 2 is confirmed and its spin-parity is determined for the first time as J P \u00bc 3 \u2212 . The branching fraction, mass and width of this structure are determined together with those of the D \u00c3 0 \u00f02400\u00de \u2212 and D \u00c3",

Accurate measurements of the various CKM matrix parameters through different processes provide sensitivity to new physics effects, by testing the global consistency of the Standard Model.

The decay B 0 \u2192D 0 \u03c0 \u00fe \u03c0 \u2212 contains information about excited D mesons decaying to D\u03c0, with natural spin and parity J P \u00bc 0 \u00fe ; 1 \u2212 ; 2 \u00fe ; \u2026 A complementary Dalitz plot analysis of the decay B 0 s \u2192D 0 K \u2212 \u03c0 \u00fe was recently published by LHCb [25,26], and constrains the phenomenology of theD 0 K \u2212 (D \u2212 sJ ) and K \u2212 \u03c0 \u00fe states. The spectrum of excited D mesons is predicted by theory [27,28] and contains the known states D \u00c3 \u00f02010\u00de; D \u00c3 0 \u00f02400\u00de; D \u00c3 2 \u00f02460\u00de, as well as other unknown states not yet fully explored. An extensive discussion on theory predictions for the c\u016b, cd and cs mass spectra is provided in Refs. [26,29]. More recent measurements performed in inclusive decays by BABAR [30] and LHCb [29] have led to the observation of several new states: D \u00c3 \u00f02650\u00de; D \u00c3 \u00f02760\u00de, and D \u00c3 \u00f03000\u00de. However, their spin and parity are difficult to determine from inclusive studies. Orbitally excited D mesons have also been studied in semileptonic B decays (see a review in Ref. [31]) with limited precision. These are of prime interest both in the extraction of the CKM parameter jV cb j, where longstanding differences remain between exclusive and inclusive methods (see review in Ref. [32]), and in recent studies of B \u2192 D \u00f0\u00c3\u00de \u03c4\u03bd \u03c4 [33] which have generated much theoretical discussion (see, e.g., Refs. [34,35]).",

This study helps in understanding the effects of color suppression in B decays, which is due to the requirement that the color quantum numbers of the quarks produced from the virtual W boson must match those of the spectator quark to form a \u03c1 0 meson [36][37][38][39][40]. Moreover, using isospin symmetry to relate the decay amplitudes of B 0 \u2192D 0 \u03c1 0 , B 0 \u2192 D \u2212 \u03c1 \u00fe and B \u00fe \u2192D 0 \u03c1 \u00fe , effects of final-state interactions (FSI) can be studied in those decays (see a review in Refs. [37,41]). The previous measurement for the branching fraction of B 0 \u2192D 0 \u03c1 0 has limited precision, \u00f03.2 AE 0.5\u00de \u00d7 10 \u22124 [21], and is in agreement with theoretical predictions that range from 1.7 to 3.4 \u00d7 10 \u22124 [38,42].",

            "text": "Finally, a study of the \u03c0 \u00fe \u03c0 \u2212 system is performed on a broad phase-space range in B 0 \u2192D 0 \u03c0 \u00fe \u03c0 \u2212 from 280 MeV=c 2 (\u22482m \u03c0 ) to 3.4 GeV=c 2 (\u2248m B 0 d \u2212 m D 0 ), which is much larger than that accessible in charmed meson decays such as D 0 \u2192 K 0 S \u03c0 \u00fe \u03c0 \u2212 [43][44][45] or in B decays such as B 0 \u00f0s\u00de \u2192 J=\u03c8\u03c0 \u00fe \u03c0 \u2212 [46][47][48][49]. The nature of the light scalar \u03c0 \u00fe \u03c0 \u2212 states below 1 GeV=c 2 (J PC \u00bc 0 \u00fe\u00fe ), and in particular the f 0 \u00f0500\u00de and f 0 \u00f0980\u00de states, has been a longstanding debate (see, e.g., Refs. [50][51][52]). Popular interpretations include tetraquarks, meson-meson bound states (molecules), or some other mixtures, where the isosinglets f 0 \u00f0500\u00de and f 0 \u00f0980\u00de can mix, therefore leading to a nontrivial nature (e.g. pure ss state) of the f 0 \u00f0980\u00de and complicating the determination of the CKM phase \u03d5 s from B 0 s \u2192 J=\u03c8\u03c0 \u00fe \u03c0 \u2212 decays [48,53,54]. In the tetraquark picture, the mixing angle, \u03c9 mix , between the f 0 \u00f0980\u00de and f 0 \u00f0500\u00de states is predicted to be j\u03c9 mix j \u2248 20\u00b0 [55,56] (recomputed with the latest average of the mass of the \u03ba meson 682 AE 29 MeV=c 2 [32]). Other theory models based on QCD factorization and its extensions [57,58] predict that the f 0 \u00f0500\u00de and f 0 \u00f0980\u00de mixing angle \u03c6 mix for the qq model is 20\u00b0\u2272 \u03c6 mix \u2272 45\u00b0. The LHCb experiment, in the study of B 0 \u00f0s\u00de \u2192 J=\u03c8\u03c0 \u00fe \u03c0 \u2212 decays [47][48][49], has already set stringent upper bounds on \u03c6 mix in B 0 (B 0 s ) decay: \u03c6 mix < 17\u00b0(< 7.7\u00b0) at 90% C.L. For the first time, the f 0 \u00f0500\u00de \u2212 f 0 \u00f0980\u00de mixing in the B 0 \u2192D 0 \u03c0 \u00fe \u03c0 \u2212 decay, both in qq and tetraquark pictures, is studied.",

The detector includes a high-precision tracking system consisting of a silicon-strip vertex detector surrounding the pp interaction region [60], a large-area silicon-strip detector located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4 Tm, and three stations of silicon-strip detectors and straw drift tubes [61] placed downstream of the magnet. The tracking system provides a measurement of momentum, p, with a relative uncertainty that varies from 0.4% at low momentum to 0.6% at 100 GeV=c. The minimum distance of a track to a primary vertex, the impact parameter (IP), is measured with a resolution of \u00f015 \u00fe 29=p T \u00de \u03bcm, where p T is the component of p transverse to the beam, in GeV=c. Different types of charged hadrons are distinguished using information from two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors [62]. Photon, electron and hadron candidates are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter and a hadronic calorimeter. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers [63].",

For hadrons, the transverse energy threshold is 3.5 GeV.

At least one charged particle must have a transverse momentum p T > 1.7 GeV=c and be inconsistent with originating from a PV.

The decay model contains four components fromD 0 \u03c0 \u2212 resonances, four P-wave \u03c0 \u00fe \u03c0 \u2212 resonances and one D-wave \u03c0 \u00fe \u03c0 \u2212 resonance. Two models are used to describe the S-wave \u03c0 \u00fe \u03c0 \u2212 resonances. The isobar model uses four components, including the f 0 \u00f0500\u00de, f 0 \u00f0980\u00de, f 0 \u00f02020\u00de resonances and a nonresonant contribution. The K-matrix approach describes the \u03c0 \u00fe \u03c0 \u2212 S-wave using a 5 \u00d7 5 scattering matrix with a production vector. The overall branching fraction of B 0 \u2192D 0 \u03c0 \u00fe \u03c0 \u2212 and quasitwo-body decays are measured. Significant contributions from the f 0 \u00f0500\u00de, f 0 \u00f0980\u00de, \u03c1\u00f01450\u00de and D \u00c3 3 \u00f02760\u00de \u2212 mesons are observed for the first time. For the latter, this is a confirmation of the observation from previous inclusive measurements, and the spin-parity of this resonance is determined for the first time to be J P \u00bc 3 \u2212 . This suggests a spectroscopic assignment of 3 D 3 , and shows that the 1D family of charm resonances can be explored in the Dalitz plot analysis of B-meson decays in the same way as recently seen for the charm-strange resonances [25,26]. Evidence for the f 0 \u00f02020\u00de meson is also seen for the first time. The measured branching fractions of two-body decays are more precise than the existing world averages and there is good agreement between values from the isobar and K-matrix models.",

VIII B), an ensemble of pseudoexperiments is generated with the same number of events as in the data sample, using parameters obtained from the fit with the D \u00c3 J \u00f02760\u00de \u2212 resonance excluded. The difference of the minima of the NLL when fitting with and withoutD \u00c3 J\u00f02760\u00de\u2212 is used as a test statistic. It corresponds to 11.4\u03c3 (11.5\u03c3) for the isobar (K-matrix) model and confirms the observation of D \u00c3 J \u00f02760\u00de \u2212 reported in Ref. [29]. The two other orbitally excited D resonances, D \u00c3 J \u00f02650\u00de \u2212 and D \u00c3 J \u00f03000\u00de \u2212 , whose observations are presented in the same paper, are added into the nominal fit model with different spin hypotheses and tiny improvements are found.
