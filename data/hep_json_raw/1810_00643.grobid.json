One of the key aspects of the physics program of the BESIII collaboration is to test the understanding of QCD at intermediate energies. Applying different experimental techniques, form factors of hadrons are measured. Among these are the pion form factor, as an important input to the (g \u2212 2) \u00b5 puzzle, and the electro-magnetic form factors of nucleons and hyperons in the time-like regime. An overview of the recent results and some ongoing studies at BESIII is provided.",

Their spatial extension has been studied e.g. in electron nucleon scattering since the 1960s, and it is still a topic of interest as manifested in the proton radius puzzle [1]. In addition to the size of hadrons, also their internal structure is of interest. It is still not fully understood how the masses of hadrons are generated. While the lightest mesons have masses of the order of 100 MeV and Baryon masses start from approximately 1 GeV, their two or three constituents have masses of only a few MeV, respectively. The difference in mass is assumed to be generated due to the internal dynamics of the hadrons. Observables, which allow to parameterize the structure and the internal dynamics are electromagnetic form factors (EMFF). At the BESIII experiment in Beijing hadron EMFFs are studied to test and enhance the understanding of non-perturbative quantum chromodynamics (QCD), where hadrons and not quarks and gluons are the relevant degrees of freedom.",

The produced hadronic system is boosted in the direction opposite to the photon. Considering the acceptance of the BESIII detector, two different analysis strategies for ISR events can be defined. On the one hand, the hadronic system as well as the ISR photon can be registered in the detector. This case is referred to as \"tagged ISR measurement\". It allows to measure cross sections from the two-pion mass threshold up to the actual center-of-mass energy of the accelerator. However, with increasing masses of the produced hadronic system, i.e. decreasing photon energies, it is more likely to mistake random signals in the EMC for an ISR photon, leading to a high background contamination. On the other hand, the hadronic system can be measured in the detector, while the ISR photon escapes detection being emitted along the beam axis. By exploiting energy and momentum conservation the photon four-vector can be determined. Requiring its polar angle to be small rejects most of the background events and selects the peaking part of the differential radiative cross section. This scenario is referred to as \"untagged ISR measurement\". Due to the boost, the acceptance for the hadronic system is limited. The higher the photon energy, i.e. in case of small masses of the hadronic system, the higher is the probability for the final state particles to be emitted close to the beam pipe, where they cannot be registered by a detector. The acceptance of the BESIII detector imposes a threshold of approximately 1 GeV/c 2 on the mass of the hadronic system in an untagged measurement.",

There is a long standing discrepancy of more than three standard deviations between the experimental value obtained in a direct measurement [8] and the theory prediction within  [9]. In order to settle this difference new measurements are performed at FNAL with the aim of a fourfold improvement of the current accuracy [10]. A first result with the accuracy of the previous measurement is expected for spring 2019. Another direct measurement is prepared at J-PARC, using a different approach [11]. The accuracy of the SM prediction is currently completely limited by the hadronic contributions to a \u00b5 . The largest of these contributions comes from leading order hadronic vacuum polarization effects. Due to the asymptotic freedom in the strong interaction, the contribution cannot be evaluated by perturbative means. Besides the recent progress in lattice QCD [12], information from experiment has been used to improve the calculations. The optical theorem relates the leading order vacuum polarization contribution a hV P,LO \u00b5 to hadronic cross sections measured in e + e \u2212 collisions. The approach allows to systematically improve the accuracy of a hV P,LO \u00b5 with high precision measurements of hadronic cross sections. The dispersive integral used to evaluate the cross section also contains a kernel function. Both, the cross sections as well as the kernel function show an energy dependence of 1/s, putting special emphasis on the cross sections at \u221a s < 1 GeV. As a consequence, the cross section \u03c3(e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ), which includes the production and decay of the \u03c1 resonance, makes up for about 70% of the absolute value of a hV P,LO \u00b5 . To evaluate its uncertainty, the cross sections of higher multiplicities e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 , e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 2\u03c0 0 and e + e \u2212 \u2192 2\u03c0 + 2\u03c0 \u2212 also play an important role.",

However, their results differ by more than 3%, which is reflected in the uncertainty of the evaluation of a hV P,LO \u00b5 . In order to clarify the situation, a new high precision measurement has been performed at BESIII [15]. Based on 2.93 fb \u22121 of data taken at \u221a s = 3.773 GeV, the method of tagged ISR has been used to study the cross section of two-pion production at center of mass energies between 600 and 900 MeV/c 2 . Due to the similar masses of the final state particles, the radiative production of muon pairs e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 constitutes the dominating background contribution. Combining the information from different sub-detectors, like energy loss in the MDC, energy deposits and shower shapes in the EMC, and the penetration depth in the MUC, an artificial neural network has been trained with Monte Carlo samples to separate effectively muons from pions. Systematic differences between data and simulations have been carefully studied and corrected for. The validity of the corrections has been tested by comparing the muon event yield with the QED prediction as implemented in the Phokhara event generator [16,17], where an accuracy of 0.5% is claimed.

The hyperons are generally reconstructed from their decay to p\u03c0. Only at threshold another strategy is necessary, since the low energetic nucleons from the decay are already stopped in the beam pipe. Here, the decay mode n\u03c0 0 is exploited in addition, and the annihilation vertices ofp andn at the beam pipe are used to tag the decay of\u039b. Based on this strategy, the cross section of \u039b\u039b production and the effective FF have been determined. The results, illustrated in Fig. 3 are consistent with previous measurements, however, with improved accuracy.

This is the first measurement of the relative phase of hyperon EMFF in e + e \u2212 collisions.  The center-of-mass energies accessible at BESIII barely allow to study the threshold region of the charmed hyperon \u039b c . The reaction e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u039b + c\u039b \u2212 c has been studied at the four energies \u221a s = 4.5745 GeV, 4.580 GeV, 4.590 GeV and 4.5995 GeV [26]. The hyperons are reconstructed from ten Cabbibo-favored decay modes. The result cross sections are determined as the weighted average of the individual decay mode analyses. In addition to the Born cross section and the effective FF, the statistics at \u221a s = 4.5745 GeV and 4.5995 GeV is sufficient to determine the FF ratio in an angular analysis of the differential cross section, which is the first determination of the FF ratios for charmed baryons. As can be seen in Fig. 3, there seems to be a tension between the results for the effective FF obtained by the Belle collaboration [27] and the BESIII result. While the Belle measurement is compatible with a vanishing cross section at threshold, the BESIII result suggests a plateau in the cross section. However, the binning of the Belle result, which was obtained using the ISR method, is rather coarse. The lowest mass bin also extends below the \u039b c\u039bc threshold, which might distort the distribution. Further, high precision measurement are necessary to improve the understanding of charmed hyperon production at threshold.",
