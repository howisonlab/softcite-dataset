The normalized differential cross sections are measured separately for electron and muon decay channels as well as for their combination up to p Z T of 350 GeV for invariant dilepton masses 66 GeV < m < 116 GeV. The measurement is compared to predictions of perturbative QCD and various event generators. The prediction of resummed QCD combined with fixed order perturbative QCD is found to be in good agreement with the data.",

            "text": "In hadron collisions, the weak vector bosons W and Z are produced with a momentum component transverse to the beam axis, which is balanced by a recoiling hadronic system mainly arising from initial state QCD radiation of quarks and gluons. The measurement of the boson transverse momentum offers a very sensitive way of studying dynamical effects of the strong interaction, complementary to measurements of the associated production of the bosons with jets [1]. The simple signatures of Z /\u03b3 * \u2192 e + e \u2212 and Z /\u03b3 * \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 production, which can be identified with little background, enable a precise measurement of the boson transverse momentum (p Z T ) and thus provide an ideal testing ground for predictions of QCD and phenomenological models. Moreover, the knowledge of the p Z T distribution is crucial to improve the modelling of W boson production needed for a precise measurement of the W mass [2,3], in particular in the low p Z T region which dominates the cross section.",

In this kinematic regime, the cross section is dominated by the radiation of a single parton. Fully differential inclusive boson production cross sections can be obtained at O(\u03b1 2 S ) with Fewz [6,7] and Dynnlo [8]. While the integrated O(\u03b1 2 S ) cross section predictions are finite, the fixed order pQCD prediction diverges at vanishing p Z T . In this regime, the leading contribution of multiple soft gluon emissions to the inclusive cross section can be resummed to all orders [9][10][11] up to next-to-nextto-leading logarithms (NNLL) [12] in \u03b1 S .

The hadron calorimeter is based on scintillating tiles in the central re-gion (|\u03b7| < 1.7). It is extended up to 4.9 in pseudorapidity by endcaps and forward calorimeters which use liquid argon. The muon spectrometer is based on three large superconducting toroids arranged with an eight-fold azimuthal coil symmetry around the calorimeters, covering a range of |\u03b7| < 2.7 and providing an integral magnetic field varying from about 1 to 8 T m.

The trigger efficiencies are defined for Z /\u03b3 * \u2192 e + e \u2212 and Z /\u03b3 * \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 events as the fraction of triggered electrons or muons with respect to the reconstructed lepton and are studied as a function of their p T and \u03b7.

For systematic studies and comparisons, a Mc@nlo based signal sample is used with underlying event parameters (Jimmy) tuned to Tevatron and 7 TeV ATLAS pp collision data [35]. The response of the ATLAS detector to the generated particles is modelled using Geant4 [36], and the fully simulated events [37] are passed through the same reconstruction chain as the data. The Monte Carlo simulation (MC) is corrected for differences with respect to the data in the lepton reconstruction and identification efficiencies as well as in energy (momentum) scale and resolution. The efficiencies are determined from a tag-and-probe method based on reconstructed Z and W events [38,39], while the resolution and scale corrections are obtained from a fit to the observed Z boson line shape. The lepton identification efficiencies can depend on the hadronic activity, which is correlated with the Z /\u03b3 * transverse momentum. Therefore, using the tag-and-probe method, it is verified that the p Z T dependence of the single lepton efficiency is correctly modelled after efficiency corrections. Differences between data and simulation are mostly consistent with statistical fluctuations and are considered as systematic uncertainties due to the modelling of the efficiencies as described in Section 7. The shaded bands indicate the systematic uncertainty on the MC prediction due to the lepton momentum resolution correction. The Pythia sample, which is normalized to the next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) prediction [40,6,7], is used for signal events. The total background, which is invisible on this scale, amounts to only 1.5% and 0.4% in the ee and \u03bc\u03bc decay channels, respectively.",

The variance of these generator predictions does not entirely cover the observed difference between simulation and data. Therefore the Pythia signal sample is reweighted, in addition, to distributions based on unfolded data. The spectra obtained by unfolding the data either with the bin-by-bin method or alternative matrix unfolding techniques [41,42] are considered. These new corrected spectra feature different uncertainties. The bin-by-bin method suffers a larger systematic uncertainty due to the assumed true p Z T shape, whereas matrix-based unfolding is nearly independent of this assumption, but suffers from a larger statistical uncertainty. Each of the reweighted spectra is treated in the same way as the data, and is unfolded with the default bin-by-bin correction factors. The maximum deviation from the respective true p Z T spectrum is considered as a systematic uncertainty. A possible influence from the parton shower and hadronization model is estimated by comparing the bin-by-bin correction factors determined from either the default Pythia sample or the Mc@nlo sample.

The O(\u03b1 S ) and O(\u03b1 2 S ) pQCD predictions of the p Z T dependent cross section are obtained with Fewz v2.0 [7] and the MSTW2008 PDF sets [50]. The inclusive cross section, which is used to normalize the prediction, is calculated in the same way. The uncertainties on the normalized predictions are evaluated by variation of the renormalization and factorization scales by factors of two around the nominal scale \u03bc R = \u03bc F = M Z with the constraint 0.5 \u03bc R /\u03bc F 2, by variation of \u03b1 S within a range corresponding to 90% confidence level limits [51], and by using the PDF error eigenvector sets at 90% confidence level. They amount to \u223c 10% and \u223c 8% for the O(\u03b1 S ) and O(\u03b1 2 S ) prediction, respectively, with a dominant contribution of 9% and 6.5% from the scale variations. In contrast to the Z /\u03b3 * inclusive cross section, the prediction of the p Z T distribution suffers from substantial scale uncertainties indicating non-negligible missing higher order corrections. For p Z T > 18 GeV, the pQCD prediction receives an O(\u03b1 2 S ) correction of 26-36%. Despite this correction, the O(\u03b1 2 S ) prediction undershoots the data by about 10%, which is comparable to the size of the scale uncertainty. This deficit is smaller compared to the 15-25% difference observed at the Tevatron [25,26]. At low boson transverse momenta, where fixed order pQCD calculations are not expected to give an adequate description of the cross section, the disagreement increases rapidly towards vanishing p Z T . In addition, the measurement is compared to the predictions of Resbos and various event generators. The consistency with the data is verified with a \u03c7 2 test which uses the \u03c7 2 definition also used for the combination of the ee and \u03bc\u03bc decay channels.",

Sherpa v1.2.3 and Alpgen v2.13 are used, with the latter being interfaced to Herwig v6.510 [16] for parton shower and fragmentation into particles, and to Jimmy v4.31 [32]  The predictions of the parton shower event generators Pythia and Mc@nlo are based on the simulated samples as described above. Fig. 4b also shows the predictions of Powheg v1.0 [18] interfaced to a Pythia version with an underlying event tune to Tevatron and 7 TeV pp collision data [54]. Whereas Mc@nlo underestimates the data by about 10%, which is comparable to the size of the combined experimental and theoretical uncertainty. The measurement is compared to predictions of various event generators and a good agreement with Sherpa, Alpgen, and Pythia is found. Except for the lowest p Z T values, the measurement is limited by statistics rather than systematic uncertainties. The systematic uncertainties are also mostly limited by the size of the data sample and are expected to improve with increasing integrated luminosity.",
