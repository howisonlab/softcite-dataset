By examining the kinematic correlations between final-state particles in exclusive measurements, a useful equivalence has been established between the nuclear effects and the transverse kinematic imbalance [1]. In this contribution, the MINERvA [2] measurement with the NuMI [3] low energy (peak at 3 GeV) neutrino beams is presented. Extending the previous analysis of CCQE-like events on CH [4], the reconstructed single-transverse kinematic imbalances are studied in simulations. Based on GENIE [5] (Version 2.8.4) results with and without FSIs are compared to demonstrate the physics sensitivity of these new variables.",

However, for non-contained or inelastically scattering protons, the profile is sensitive to the non-zero momentum at the track end point and has a distorted momentum mapping. Elastically scattering contained (ESC) protons, whose end point momentum is 0, are selected by dE/dx cuts at the last 6 measurement points as they have higher dE/dx near the end point compared to the non-ESC ones. The spread of the reconstructed momentum is reduced to 60% of the default value with a reduction of statistics to 40%. An additional cut on the track fit \u03c7 2 [4] further reduces the spread to 50% and statistics to 30%. 1 The improvement on the detector response for the proton momentum and \u03b4\u03b1 T is shown in Fig. 2. One notes that because non-ESC protons have missing ranges, a momentum measurement by range can also be improved by selecting ESC protons with such dE/dx cuts.  Figure 2.
