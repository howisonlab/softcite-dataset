In contrast to the B meson system, where the high mass of the top quark in the loop weakens the suppression, the GIM cancellation is almost exact [1] in D meson decays, leading to expected branching fractions for c \u2192 u\u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 processes in the range (1 \u2212 3) \u00d7 10 \u22129 [2][3][4]. This suppression allows for subleading processes with potential for physics beyond the SM, such as FCNC decays of D mesons, and the coupling of up-type quarks in electroweak processes illustrated in Fig. 1, to be probed more precisely.",

            "text": "The total branching fraction for these decays is expected to be dominated by long-distance contributions involving resonances, such as D 0 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 V (\u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 ), where V can be any of the light vector mesons \u03c6, \u03c1 0 or \u03c9. The corresponding branching fractions can reach O(10 \u22126 ) [2][3][4]. The angular structure of these four-body semileptonic D 0 decays provides access to a variety of differential distributions. Of particular interest are angular asymmetries that allow for a theoretically robust separation of long-and short-distance effects, the latter being more sensitive to physics beyond the SM [4]. No such decays have been observed to date and the most stringent limit reported is B(D 0 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 ) < 3.0 \u00d7 10 \u22125 at 90% confidence level (CL) by the E791 Collaboration [5]. The same processes can be probed using D + (s) \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 decays. Upper limits on their branching fractions have been recently set to B(D + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 ) < 7.3 \u00d7 10 \u22128 and B(D + s \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 ) < 4.1 \u00d7 10 \u22127 at 90% CL by the LHCb Collaboration [6].

            "text": "The LHCb detector [7] is a single-arm forward spectrometer covering the pseudorapidity range 2 < \u03b7 < 5, designed for the study of particles containing b or c quarks. The detector includes a high-precision tracking system consisting of a silicon-strip vertex detector surrounding the pp interaction region, a large-area silicon-strip detector located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4 Tm, and three stations of siliconstrip detectors and straw drift tubes placed downstream. The combined tracking system provides a momentum measurement with relative uncertainty that varies from 0.4% at 5 GeV/c to 0.6% at 100 GeV/c, and impact parameter resolution of 20 \u03bcm for tracks with large transverse momentum. Different types of charged hadrons are distinguished by information from two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors [8]. Photon, electron and hadron candidates are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillatingpad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter and a hadronic calorimeter. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers [9]. The trigger [10] consists of a hardware stage, based on information from the calorimeter and muon systems, followed by a software stage, which applies a full event reconstruction. The hardware trigger selects muons with transverse momentum, p T , exceeding 1.48 GeV/c, and dimuons whose product of p T values exceeds (1.3 GeV/c) 2 . In the software trigger, at least one of the final state muons is required to have momentum larger than 8 GeV/c, and to have an impact parameter, IP, defined as the minimum distance of the particle trajectory from the associated primary vertex (PV) in three dimensions, greater than 100 \u03bcm. Alternatively, a dimuon trigger accepts events with oppositely charged muon candidates having good track quality, p T exceeding 0.5 GeV/c, and momentum exceeding 6 GeV/c. In a second stage of the software trigger, two algorithms select D 0 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 candidates. The first algorithm, used to increase the efficiency in the highest dimuon mass region, requires oppositely charged muons with scalar sum of p T greater than 1.5 GeV/c and dimuon mass greater than 1 GeV/c 2 . A second algorithm selects events with two oppositely charged muons and two oppositely charged hadrons with no invariant mass requirement on the dimuon.",
