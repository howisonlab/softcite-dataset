The final two of eight antineutrino detectors were installed in the summer of 2012. Including the 404 days of data collected from October 2012 to November 2013 resulted in a total exposure of 6.9\u00d710 5 GW th -ton-days, a 3.6 times increase over our previous results. Improvements in energy calibration limited variations between detectors to 0.2%. Removal of six 241 Am-13 C radioactive calibration sources reduced the background by a factor of two for the detectors in the experimental hall furthest from the reactors. Direct prediction of the antineutrino signal in the far detectors based on the measurements in the near detectors explicitly minimized the dependence of the measurement on models of reactor antineutrino emission. The uncertainties in our estimates of sin 2 2\u03b813 and |\u2206m 2 ee | were halved as a result of these improvements. Analysis of the relative antineutrino rates and energy spectra between detectors gave sin 2 2\u03b813 = 0.084 \u00b1 0.005 and |\u2206m 2 ee | = (2.42 \u00b1 0.11) \u00d7 10 \u22123 eV 2 in the three-neutrino framework.",

The Daya Bay experiment previously reported the discovery of a non-zero value of sin 2 2\u03b8 13 by observing the disappearance of reactor antineutrinos over kilometer distances [1,6,7], and the first measurement of the effective mass splitting |\u2206m 2 ee | [8] via the distortion of the \u03bd e energy spectrum [9]. Here we present new results with significant improvements in energy calibration and background reduction. Installation of the final two detectors and a tripling of operation time provided a total exposure of 6.9\u00d710 5 GW th -ton-days, 3.6 times more than reported in our previous publication [9]. With these improvements the precision of sin 2 2\u03b8 13 was enhanced by a factor of two compared to the world's previous best estimate. The precision of |\u2206m 2 ee | was equally enhanced, and is now competitive with the precision of |\u2206m 2 32 | measured via accelerator neutrino disappearance [10,11].",

The signals of 0.3% of the PMTs were discarded due to abnormal hit rates or charge distributions. The detector energy scale was calibrated using Am-C neutron sources [18] deployed at the detector center, with the \u223c8 MeV peaks from neutrons captured on Gd aligned across all eight detectors. The time variation and the position dependence of the energy scale was corrected using the 2.506 MeV gamma-ray peak from 60 Co calibration sources. The reconstructed energies of various calibration reference points in different ADs are compared in Fig. 1. The spatial distribution of each calibration reference varies, incorporating deviations in spatial response between detectors. Figure 1 presents measurements of 68 Ge, 60 Co and Am-C calibration sources when placed at the center of each detector. Neutrons from IBD and muon spallation that were captured on gadolinium, were distributed nearly uniformly throughout the Gd-LS region. Those neutrons that were captured on 1 H, intrinsic \u03b1 particles from polonium and radon decays, and gammas from 40 K and 208 Tl decays, were distributed inside and outside of the target volume. All of these events were selected within the Gd-LS region based on their reconstructed vertices. The uncorrelated relative uncertainty of the energy scale is thus determined to be 0.2%. This reduction of 43% compared to the previous publication [9] was enabled by improvements in the correction of position and time dependence, and enhanced the precision of |\u2206m 2 ee | by 9%. The reduction was confirmed by an alternative method which used the n-Gd capture of muon-induced spallation neutrons to calibrate the scale, time dependence, and spatial dependence of the detector energy response.",

In order to suppress cosmogenic products, candidates were rejected if their delayed signal occurred (i) within a (\u22122 \u00b5s, 600 \u00b5s) time-window with respect to an IWS or OWS trigger with a PMT multiplicity > 12, (ii) within a (\u22122 \u00b5s, 1000 \u00b5s) time-window with respect to triggers in the same AD with reconstructed energy > 20 MeV, or (iii) within a (\u22122 \u00b5s, 1 s) time-window with respect to triggers in the same AD with reconstructed energy > 2.5 GeV. To select only definite signal pairs, we required the signal to have a multiplicity of 2: no other > 0.7 MeV signal occurred within a (t p \u2212 200 \u00b5s, t d + 200 \u00b5s) time-window.",

The background produced by the three Am-C neutron sources inside the automated calibration units contributed significantly to the total systematic uncertainty of the correlated backgrounds in the 6-AD period. Because of this, two of the three Am-C sources in each AD in EH3 were removed during the 2012 summer installation period. As a result, the average correlated Am-C background rate in the far hall decreased by a factor of 4 in the 8-AD period. As in previous publications [1,9], this rate was determined by monitoring the single neutron production rate from the Am-C sources. Removal of these Am-C sources had negligible consequences for our calibration.",

Relaxing the promptenergy selection to (0.7-100) MeV revealed the fast-neutron background spectrum above 12 MeV. Previously we deduced the rate and spectrum of this background using a linear extrapolation into the IBD prompt signal region. Here we used a background-enhanced dataset to improve the estimate. We found 6043 fast neutron candidates with prompt energy from 0.7 to 100 MeV in the 200 \u00b5s following cosmogenic signals only detected by the OWS or RPC. The energy spectrum of these veto-tagged signals was consistent with the spectrum of IBD-like candidate signals above 12 MeV, and was used to estimate the rate and energy spectrum for the fast neutron background from 0.7 to 12 MeV. The systematic uncertainty was estimated from the difference between this new analysis and the extrapolation method previously employed, and was determined to be half of the estimate reported in Ref. [6].",

[1,6] to estimate the backgrounds from the uncorrelated prompt-delayed pairs (i.e. accidentals), the correlated \u03b2-n decays from cosmogenic 9 Li and 8 He, and the 13 C(\u03b1,n) 16 O reaction, were extended to the current 6+8 AD data sample. The decrease in the singleneutron rate from the Am-C sources reduced the average rate of accidentals in the far hall by a factor of 2.7. As a result, the total backgrounds amount to about 3% (2%) of the IBD candidate sample in the far (near) hall(s). The systematic uncertainties in the 13 C(\u03b1,n) 16 O cross section and in the transportation of the \u03b1 particles were reassessed through a comparison of experimental results and simulation packages, respectively [19]. The estimation of 9 Li/ 8 He now dominated the background uncertainty in both the near and far halls. The estimated signal and background rates, as well as the efficiencies of the muon veto, \u00b5 , and multiplicity selection, m , are summarized in Table I. A detailed treatment of the absolute and relative efficiencies using the first six ADs was reported in Refs. [6,14]. The uncertainties of the absolute efficiencies are correlated among the ADs and thus play a negligible role in the relative measurement of \u03bd e disappearance. The performance of the two new ADs was found to be consistent with the other detectors. Estimates of two prominent uncorrelated uncertainties, the delayed-energy selection efficiency and the fraction of neutrons captured on Gd, were confirmed for all eight ADs using improved energy reconstruction and increased statistics.",

A separate manuscript, in preparation, will present the evidence in detail and provide the necessary data to allow detailed comparison of our measurement with existing and future models. Given these discrepancies between measurements and models, here we present a technique for predicting the signal in the far hall based on measurements obtained in the near halls, with minimal dependence on models of the reactor antineutrinos.

While we use sin 2 2\u03b8 12 = 0.857 \u00b1 0.024 and \u2206m 2 21 = (7.50 \u00b1 0.20) \u00d7 10 \u22125 eV 2 from Ref. [31], our result was largely independent of these values. Consistent results were obtained when our previous methods [1,9] were applied to this larger dataset. Under the normal (inverted) hierarchy assumption, |\u2206m 2 ee | yields \u2206m 2 32 = (2.37 \u00b1 0.11) \u00d7 10 \u22123 eV 2 (\u2206m 2 32 = \u2212(2.47 \u00b1 0.11) \u00d7 10 \u22123 eV 2 ). This result was consistent with and of comparable precision to measurements obtained from accelerator \u03bd \u00b5 and\u03bd \u00b5 disappearance [10,11]. Using only the relative rates between the detectors and \u2206m 2 32 from Ref. [10] we found sin 2 2\u03b8 13 = 0.085 \u00b1 0.006, with \u03c7 2 /NDF = 1.37/3.",

The total uncertainties of both sin 2 2\u03b8 13 and |\u2206m 2 ee | are dominated by statistics. The most significant systematic uncertainties for sin 2 2\u03b8 13 are due to the relative detector efficiency, reactor power, relative energy scale and 9 Li/ 8 He background. The systematic uncertainty in |\u2206m 2 ee | is dominated by uncertainty in the relative energy scale.

The data points represent the ratios of the observed antineutrino spectra to the expectation assuming no oscillation.
