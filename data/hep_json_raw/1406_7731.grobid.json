The two generalpurpose detectors at the LHC, ATLAS and CMS, recorded an integrated luminosity of \u2248 5 fb \u22121 in 2011, which offered the possibility to study the properties of diboson production to high precision. These measurements test predictions of the Standard Model (SM) in a new energy regime and are crucial for the understanding and the measurement of the SM Higgs boson and other new particles. In this review, special emphasis is drawn on the combination of results from both experiments and a common interpretation with respect to state-of-the-art SM predictions.",

            "text": "The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics is a quantum field theory based on the SU (3) C \u2297 SU (2) L \u2297 U (1) Y gauge symmetry group and describes the strong, weak and electromagnetic interactions among elementary particles [1]. As a direct consequence of the non-Abelian gauge symmetry of the electroweak sector, i.e. the SU (2) L \u2297 U (1) Y gauge group, the SM predicts self-coupling vertices of the gauge bosons. At the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), these vertices lead to the production of diboson final states. Moreover, the discovery of the Higgs boson in the year 2012 [2], [3] was due to its diboson decay channels. The production of pairs of vector bosons is therefore not only an important background for studies of the newly-discovered Higgs boson, but also provides a unique opportunity to test the electroweak sector of the SM. These precision tests have already a long history in particle physics. The LEP experiments performed precise measurements of the e + e \u2212 \u2192 W + W \u2212 and e + e \u2212 \u2192 ZZ cross sections as a function of center-of-mass energy [4][5][6][7]. The clean experimental signature and nature of the purely electroweak calculations allowed for a precise study of the gauge-group nature of the SM. Limits on possible extensions and deviations from the SM predictions were also drawn. Some of those limits are still the most stringent ones available. Since the e + e \u2212 \u2192 W W cross section depends crucially on the mass of the W boson (m W ), the cross section dependence on the center-of-mass energy allowed for an indirect determination of m W .",

We present the experimental signatures and the differences between the measurement strategies in detail. Special focus is drawn on combinations of various results from both experiments and their interpretations within the SM. The results published by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations form the basis for this review. The combinations of these results and further derived information have been conducted with great care, but are solely based on the private work of the authors of this article and do not reassemble any official joint ATLAS and CMS effort. This article is structured as follows. In Sect. 2, we briefly summarize the most important features of the electroweak sector of the SM, the theoretical methodology for the predictions of diboson production in pp collisions, and the description of new physics scenarios regarding diboson production. The LHC collider, the ATLAS and CMS experiments, as well as further experimental aspects are discussed in Sect. 3. Measurements that are sensitive to the W W Z and W W \u03b3 vertices, i.e.measurements of the W + W \u2212 , the W \u00b1 Z and the W \u00b1 \u03b3 final states, are presented in Sect. 4. The ZZ and Z\u03b3 final states are sensitive to ZZZ, ZZ\u03b3 and Z\u03b3\u03b3 vertices that are not allowed in the SM; they are discussed in Sect. 5. The results on the cross section measurements and the limits on anomalous triple gauge couplings (aTGCs) are interpreted in Sect. 6. In addition, the sensitivity to quartic gauge couplings (QGCs) is briefly discussed. Section 7 summarizes all the results and gives an outlook for future measurements at the LHC.",

            "text": "The diboson production at hadron colliders is significantly different than the production mechanism at lepton colliders due to the complicated internal structure of protons. The proton structure can be described phenomenologically by parton density functions (PDFs), written as f A,q (x, Q 2 ) for parton-type q in proton A with a relative momentum of x = p q /p A in the direction of the proton's motion for an energy scale Q 2 of the scattering process. Here, p q and p A denote the momenta of the parton and proton, respectively. For the production of vector boson pairs (V V ), the energy scale is often set to the invariant mass of the two vector bosons, i.e. Q 2 = M 2 V V . The factorization theorem states that the production cross section in pp collisions can be expressed by combining PDFs with a fundamental partonic cross section\u03c3 qq\u2192V V , illustrated Figure 2. Illustration of the factorization theorem used to calculate the production cross section in pp collisions.  6) where\u03c3 qq \u2192V V is the cross section of the inclusive hard scattering process of two partons leading to two vector bosons in the final state. The sum runs over all quark flavors, and the integration is performed over the momentum fractions of the two colliding partons x A and x B . The factorization theorem holds not only for inclusive hard-scattering processes but also for perturbative QCD corrections. The partonic cross section is governed by the L N , L C , and L W W V terms of the SM Lagrangian given in Eqn. 2.1. The corresponding leading-order (LO) and some nextto-leading-order (NLO) Feynman diagrams are shown in Fig. 3 for different production channels. It should be noted that W \u03b3 and Z\u03b3 final states can also be realized by initial and/or final state radiation processes of the participating fermions.",

            "text": "Of special importance is the s-channel as it involves TGCs that are predicted within the SM. Any new physics model that involves new or alternative interactions between the SM electroweak gauge bosons may change these TGCs and hence change the corresponding observables. An enhancement of the s-channel contribution to the full diboson production cross section is predicted to increase with rising parton collision energy\u015d, i.e. with the invariant mass of diboson system M V V . This dependence is shown in Fig. 4 where an aTGC scenario is assumed for the W W (Z/\u03b3) production vertex. Regions in the phase space that correspond to high center-of-mass energies of the interacting partons therefore provide a high sensitivity to new physics scenarios. Figure 3 shows some examples of Feynman diagrams due to the NLO QCD corrections. In particular, the quark-gluon fusion in the initial state leads to a significant increase in the production cross section at a pp collision energy of 7 TeV 1 . The gluon-gluon fusion with fermions in the loop contribute approximately 3%. The NLO QCD corrections have been first calculated in [15][16][17][18][19][20][21][22][23]. It should be noted that usually additional jets in the W + W \u2212 diboson production are experimentally vetoed to reduce the background from the pair production of top quarks. Hence, a significant contribution of the NLO QCD corrections to the W + W \u2212 process are not directly studied experimentally.",

However, EW corrections increase with the square of log(\u015d) and can reach several percent at the energies While electroweak corrections modify the inclusive production cross section by less than 0.5%, they induce variations up to 10% in the rapidity distribution of the diboson pair.

This combination is complicated by the fact that the phase space of NLO matrix element calculation partially overlaps with parton shower approaches. Several matching schemes have been suggested to provide a combination methodology of LO matrix element calculations for different parton multiplicities and parton shower models. These schemes avoid double counting of final state particles by reweighting techniques and veto-algorithms. The Mangano (MLM) scheme [45] and the Catani-Krauss-Kuler-Webber (CKKW) matching scheme [46]  [47] are widely used for tree-level generators.",

The basic idea is to remove all terms of the NLO matrix element expression which are generated by the subsequent parton shower. The Powheg procedure [49] which is implemented in the PowhegBox framework [50] was the second approach developed for NLO matrix element matching. The Powheg procedure assumes that the highest energy emitted parton is generated first and then feed into the shower generators of the subsequent softer radiation. In contrast to the MC@NLO approach, only positive weights appear and in addition the procedure can be interfaced to other event generators besides herwig.",

Both ATLAS [65] and CMS [66] detectors are general-purpose detectors and are composed of many sub-detectors, each of which has a specific task in the reconstruction of the events. Although these two detectors are differ in design and conception, the basic detection structure is similar. Both detectors have fast, multi-level trigger systems to select complex signatures online; fast data acquisition systems to record all selected events; excellent inner tracking detectors allowing efficient high-p T tracking and secondary vertex reconstruction; fine-grained, high-resolution electromagnetic calorimeters for electron and photon reconstruction; full coverage hadronic calorimetry for jet and missing transverse energy measurements; and high-precision muon systems with standalone tracking capability. The layouts of the ATLAS and CMS detectors are shown in Fig. 7. ATLAS emphasizes jet, missing transverse energy, and standalone muon measurements, while CMS has prioritized electron, photon, and inner tracking measurements. CMS has chosen to have a single huge solenoid immersing the inner tracker and elec-tromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters inside a 4 T axial magnetic field. To reduce the occupancy of the inner tracking detector at the LHC design luminosity, the inner tracker consists solely of silicon pixel and microstrip detectors, which provide high granularity at all radii. CMS relies on the fine lateral granularity of its lead tungstate scintillating crystal electromagnetic calorimeter for electron and photon measurements. The hadronic sampling calorimeter system consists of brass absorbers and scintillating tiles readout via wavelengthshifting optical fibers guiding the light to photomultiplier tubes. The strong constraints imposed by the solenoid have resulted in a barrel hadronic calorimeter with insufficient absorption before the coil, so a tail catcher has been added around the coil to provide better protection against punch-through to the muon system. Driven by the design of the magnet, CMS relies on the high solenoidal field to bend muon tracks in the transverse plane, requiring the extrapolation of the track into the inner tracker.",

The inner tracker consist of silicon pixel and microstrip detectors at small radii and transition radiation tracker (TRT) at large radii. For electron and photon measurements, ATLAS relies on the fine segmentation along both the lateral and longitudinal directions of electromagnetic shower development using a lead and liquid-argon sampling technique. The hadronic calorimeter system uses a sampling technique similar to that used by CMS except iron and copper are used as absorbers. The structure of barrel and endcap toroid magnets allows standalone muon tracking inside the large area spanned by the toroids.",

Two radial coordinates are used to describe event kinematics: the azimuthal angle \u03c6 is defined in the xy-plane and the polar angle \u03b8 is defined with respect to the z-axis. The polar angle is commonly used to define the pseudorapidity parameter \u03b7 = \u2212 log tan \u03b8 2 . Observations of heavy diboson pair production processes at the LHC resulted from analyses of the fully leptonic (in which W decays to \u03bd and Z bosons decay to , where = e, \u00b5) and semi-leptonic decay channels (in which one boson decays leptonically while the other boson decays to hadrons or neutrinos).

The hadronic decay modes of the vector bosons are hard to be distinguished in hadron colliders due to the overwhelmingly large cross-section of jet-induced background processes. The CMS collaboration has published a combined cross section measurement based on semi-leptonic decays in W W and W Z pairs where the W boson decays leptonically while the second boson decays hadronically [80].

Data is used to estimate the background from the W + jets production when photons come from the decays of mesons produced in jet fragmentation. ATLAS used a twodimensional sideband method which considered the distribution of signal and background events in a phase space defined by two uncorrelated variables for which the signal and background have different shapes. The phase space is partitioned into four regions with one signal region and three control regions in which one or both selections are reversed. The ratio of the number of background events in two control regions provides the transfer factor which is combined with events in the third control region to estimate the background contribution in the signal region. The two discriminating variables are the photon isolation and the photon identification based on the shower shape in the ATLAS analysis. CMS used a template method which relies on a maximum-likelihood fit to the data distribution of the photon energy-weighted width in pseudorapidity (\u03c3 \u03b7\u03b7 ). The fit makes use of the expected distributions (\"templates\") for genuine photons and misidentified jets. The distribution in \u03c3 \u03b7\u03b7 is very narrow and symmetric, and the templates are obtained from simulated W \u03b3 events. The \u03c3 \u03b7\u03b7 distribution for backgrounds is asymmetric with a slow falloff at large value, and the templates are defined by events in a background-enriched isolation sideband of data. The maximum-likelihood fit is performed in several photon p T bins. The estimated background contribution has been crosschecked with an alternative method.

ATLAS used MC simulation for its estimation, and various studies of the probability to lose one lepton from Z decay due to acceptance and the modeling of E miss T in Z + \u03b3 and Z+ jets events have been performed and checked with collision data. ATLAS also used a two-dimensional sideband method to estimate the \u03b3+ jets background, with lepton isolation and E miss T as the independent variables. CMS used a data-driven method to estimate the Z/\u03b3 * \u2192 background. The background in the e\u03bd\u03b3 decay channel is dominated by Z+ jets events, and the contribution is obtained from a fit to the invariant mass distribution of the photon and electron candidates. To determine the background in the \u00b5\u03bd\u03b3 decay channel where an electron is misidentified as a photon, a new sample is selected with events passing all event selection criteria except that the presence of a track in the pixel detector associated with the photon candidate is ignored. The contribution from genuine electrons misidentified as photons can therefore be derived from the total number of events in this new sample and the probability for an electron not to have a matching track. This probability can be measured from Z \u2192 ee data by requiring stringent electron identification criteria on one electron and checking how often the other electron passes the full photon selection criteria, including the requirement of having no associated track in the pixel detector.",

The rate for loosely-isolated objects to be misidentified as isolated ones is estimated with events with one selected Z boson and an additional probe lepton. No isolation requirement is applied to the probe lepton. The misidentification rate is defined as the ratio of the number of probe candidates that pass the isolation requirements to the initial number of probe candidates. This rate is then applied to events which pass all selection requirements but requiring the probe candidate not to be isolated to estimate the number of background events in the signal region.

Production of a Z (or W ) boson in association with jets can also give similar final states if the jet momenta are mismeasured or if one jet is misidentified as an isolated lepton.

The extrapolation from the e\u00b5 channel to the ee or \u00b5\u00b5 channel uses the relative branching fractions as well as the ratio of the efficiencies ee or \u00b5\u00b5 of the ee or \u00b5\u00b5 selections to the efficiency e\u00b5 of the e\u00b5 selection, which differs from unity due to differences in the electron and muon efficiencies. The contribution from the W Z process is estimated using the simulated samples and checked using a control region with three high-p T isolated leptons. The contribution from the Z+jets process is estimated using events with a high-p T photon and jets as a template, since the mechanism for large missing transverse energy is the same as in Z+jets events. The events are reweighted such that the photon p T matches the observed Z boson p T and are normalized to the observed Z+jets yield. The procedure is repeated in bins of Z boson p T in order to obtain the p T distribution of the Z+jets backgrounds.

The cut-off scale in the ATLAS analyses is chosen to match the energy at which the unitarity is still preserved. As previously discussed, the W W Z and W W \u03b3 vertices can be studied by the W W , W Z and W \u03b3 final states. Both ATLAS and CMS experiments derived aTGC limits using the transverse momentum of the leading lepton in the W W final state. CMS published limits only based on the LEP scenario [84], while ATLAS provided limits assuming the LEP scenario, the equal coupling assumptions, the HISZ assumptions and no further constraints [83]. Limits on aTGCs via the W Z analysis are available from the ATLAS collaboration [88] and are based on the study of the transverse momentum spectrum of the Z boson. Both experiments derived limits via the W \u03b3 final state [90,91] using the measured energy of the final state photon. A summary on aTGC parameters involving the W W Z and W W \u03b3 without form factors is given in Tab. 20 and illustrated in Fig. 31. The results from the W W analyses provide the most sensitive limits assuming defined relationships between the couplings. For unconstrained limits, the W Z and W \u03b3 analyses lead to significant improvements on the relevant coupling parameters. The effect of a form factor on the observed limits varies from a degradation of 10% for the W W analysis with a cut-off scale of \u039b = 6 TeV, to 30% for the W Z-analysis with \u039b = 2 TeV.",

In the ZZ analyses, CMS used the invariant mass of the four-lepton system [93], while ATLAS uses the transverse momentum of the Z boson to derive limits on aTGCs [92]. Both experiments used the transverse energy of the photon in the Z\u03b3 channel for the limit extraction [90,91]. A summary of the derived limits assuming no form factors is given in Tab. 20 and illustrated in Fig. 31. The given limits degrade by 30% to 150% with \u039b = 3 TeV for the ZZ analyses and with \u039b = 2 TeV for the Z\u03b3 analyses, respectively. The limits on the ZZV and Z\u03b3V vertices are partly comparable between the two experiments, where the limits on the ZZ\u03b3 and Z\u03b3\u03b3 couplings are driven by the analyses of the Z\u03b3 \u2192 \u03bd\u03bd\u03b3 process. However, CMS achieves significantly more stringent exclusion limits on h 3 V and h 4 V , which is due to an optimized binning of the sensitive signal region. As discussed in Sect. 2.5, the present limits depend on various theoretical assumptions, thus it will be difficult to reinterpret those limits in the future when new theoretical models are proposed. One possibility to overcome those constraints is the publication of the production cross sections in sensitive regions of the phase space, which in turn can be easily used to derive limits on various theoretical scenarios. Those published cross sections Table 20. Summary of the observed 95% confidence exclusion limits on anomalous couplings on the W W V vertex, assuming the LEP scenario and also with no further assumptions for the ATLAS and CMS experiment. Except for the coupling under study, all other anomalous couplings are set to zero. The results are shown for an energy cut-off scale \u039b = \u221e, i.e. no form factor has been used. The limits marked with (*) are derived by the authors by assuming perfect error ellipses, that describe the published results of the experiments.    In order to test the usefulness of this approach, we compare the derived limits on the W W V vertex based on the reconstructed lepton p T distribution to the limits obtained Table 21. The summary of the observed 95% C.L. on anomalous couplings on the ZZV and Z\u03b3V vertex for the ATLAS and CMS experiment. Except for the coupling under study, all other anomalous couplings are set to zero. The results are shown an energy-cut of scale \u039b = \u221e, i.e. no form factor has been used. using the published differential cross sections. In a first step, we use the MCFM generator to predict the production cross sections for one aTGC parameter (\u03bb Z in this case) in the fiducial phase space defined in Sect. 4.1.4 for the leading lepton p T between 140 GeV and 350 GeV. All other couplings are set to their SM values. In a second step, we compare the predicted cross sections for different \u03bb Z with the measured fiducial cross section in this phase space region of 24 \u00b1 10 fb. This leads to a limit of [\u22120.13, 0.13], which is weaker by approximately 60%. This degradation is due to the fact that the ATLAS limit derivation is based on the full reconstructed spectra, i.e. uses the full leading lepton p T shape information. However, the advantages of the limit derivation via fiducial cross sections remain and should be taken as a valid alternative option for future measurements.",

Even though the available data from the LHC run in 2010 and 2011 are not sufficient to measure quartic gauge couplings (QGCs), first sensitivity studies showing the potential of the upcoming LHC results have been made available. The SM predicts four-point vertices between electroweak gauge bosons, described in Eqn. 2.1 by the term L W W V V . The highest cross section at the LHC is expected for the W W \u03b3\u03b3 vertex, which can be studied in the reaction pp \u2192 pW + W \u2212 p with a subsequent leptonic decay of the W boson. A schematic sketch of the involved processes is shown in Fig. 5. The fully exclusive (\"elastic\") scattering is theoretically well understood and can be modeled for example by the calhep [95] program. The production cross section is 1.2 fb, taking into account the leptonic branching ratios of the W boson. The same process with a similar final state can also be induced by inelastic scattering, in which one or even both protons dissociate into a low-mass system which also escapes the detection. The inelastic scattering is theoretically less well known due to strong interactions between the proton remnants (rescattering) which produce additional hadronic activity. The LO diagrams for the \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 W + W \u2212 interactions are shown in Fig. 32. Two TGC vertices are present in the tand u-channels, while the quartic couplings only appear in the s-channel.",

A first evidence on vector boson scattering and the electroweak production of W \u00b1 W \u00b1 with two jets in pp collisions at \u221a s = 8 TeV has been recently published [97]. Also a search on the production of W W \u03b3 and W Z\u03b3 with constraints on anomalous QGCs has become available [98]. The studies of QGCs in general and the scattering of two heavy vector bosons in particular, will play a critical role in the upcoming years of the LHC physics program. Even though the discovery of the Higgs boson provides a unitarization scheme for the otherwise divergent longitudinally polarized vector boson scattering cross section with increasing center-of-mass energy, various scenarios of physics beyond the SM would enhance this scattering process. Last but not least, the scattering of two heavy gauge bosons has never been experimentally observed and its proof would be a further success of the predictive power of the SM.  Figure 36.

While the limits on the anomalous W W V vertices are still dominated by the results from the LEP experiments, the most stringent constraints on the ZZV -and Z\u03b3V -vertices are already now given by both collaborations. In addition, the possibility to use fiducial cross section measurements for the testing of these Standard Model extensions in a model independent way has been discussed. Figure 37 illustrates the dependence of the W W , W Z, and ZZ production cross sections on the center-of-mass energy. The available LHC measurements for \u221a s = 8 TeV are also shown [99][100][101][102][103]. While the increase of the cross section is only 20% between 7 TeV and 8 TeV, the cross section for the second LHC run at 13-14 TeV is expected to rise by a factor of \u2248 2.5. This increased energy, together with the expected integrated luminosity, will allow for a new round of precision measurements of the electroweak sector to gain a better understanding of the nature of the electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism.",
