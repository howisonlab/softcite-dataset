Using an exposure equivalent to 6.05 \u00d7 10 20 protons-on-target 33 \u03bde candidates were observed with a background of 8.2 \u00b1 0.8 (syst.). Combined with the latest NOvA \u03bd\u00b5 disappearance data and external constraints from reactor experiments on sin 2 2\u03b813, the hypothesis of inverted mass hierarchy with \u03b823 in the lower octant is disfavored at greater than 93% C.L. for all values of \u03b4CP .",

            "text": "This Letter reports updated results on the rate of \u03bd \u00b5 \u2192 \u03bd e transitions in the NOvA experiment [1] and constraints on oscillation parameters from the first combined fit of \u03bd e appearance and \u03bd \u00b5 disappearance data. The measurement, also probed by MINOS [2] and T2K [3] experiments, is sensitive to three unknowns in neutrino physics: the octant of \u03b8 23 (whether \u03b8 23 is less than, equal to, or greater than \u03c0/4), the neutrino mass hierarchy, and the amount of CP violation in the lepton sector. At the baseline and neutrino energy range of the NOvA experiment the probability for \u03bd \u00b5 to oscillate to \u03bd e is primarily proportional to the combination sin 2 \u03b8 23 sin 2 2\u03b8 13 . The disappearance of muon neutrinos is sensitive to the mixing angle \u03b8 23 which is relatively weakly constrained to be near-maximal (sin 2 \u03b8 23 \u2248 0.5) [2][3][4]. Reactor neutrino measurements tightly constrain sin 2 2\u03b8 13 at 0.085 \u00b1 0.005 [5][6][7]. The coherent forward scattering of the neutrino beam with electrons in the Earth enhances the electron neutrino appearance probability in the case of normal mass hierarchy (NH), where \u2206m 2 32 > 0, and suppresses it for inverted mass hierarchy (IH), where \u2206m 2 32 < 0. The possible violation of CP symmetry in the lepton sector is parameterized by \u03b4 CP . CP-conserving oscillations occur if \u03b4 CP = 0 or \u03c0, while \u03bd e appearance is enhanced around \u03b4 CP = 3\u03c0/2, and suppressed around \u03b4 CP = \u03c0/2. At NOvA's energy and baseline the impact of these three factors on the \u03bd e appearance probability are of similar magnitudes, which can lead to degeneracies between them, particularly when analyzing oscillations in neutrinos alone. For antineutrinos, the mass hierarchy and CP phase have the opposite effect on the oscillation probability, while increasing values of sin 2 \u03b8 23 increase the appearance probabilities for \u03bd e and\u03bd e alike.",

Gaussian penalty terms are applied to represent the estimates of the 1\u03c3 ranges of these parameters, and the knowledge of sin 2 2\u03b8 13 = 0.085 \u00b1 0.005 from reactor experiments [38]. Figure 4 shows the regions of (sin 2 \u03b8 23 , \u03b4 CP ) space allowed at various confidence levels. The likelihood surface is profiled over the parameters |\u2206m 2 32 | and \u03b8 13 while the solar parameters \u2206m 2 21 and \u03b8 12 are held fixed. The sig- nificances are derived using the Feldman-Cousins unified approach [39] to account for the statistical effects of low event count and physical boundaries. Figure 5 shows the significance at which values of \u03b4 CP are disfavored for each hierarchy and octant combination. The value of sin 2 \u03b8 23 is profiled within the specified octant. There are two degenerate best fit points, both in the normal hierarchy, sin 2 \u03b8 23 = 0.404, \u03b4 CP = 1.48\u03c0 and sin 2 \u03b8 23 = 0.623, \u03b4 CP = 0.74\u03c0. The inverted hierarchy predicts fewer events than are observed for all values of \u03b4 CP and both octants. The best-fit point in the inverted hierarchy occurs near \u03b4 CP = 3\u03c0/2 and is 0.46 \u03c3 from the global best-fit points. The inverted mass hierarchy in the lower octant is disfavored at greater than 93% C.L. for all values of \u03b4 CP , and excluded at greater than 3\u03c3 significance outside the range 0.97\u03c0 < \u03b4 CP < 1.94\u03c0. The T2K collaboration has recently published results based on their observation of \u03bd \u00b5 (\u03bd \u00b5 ) disappearance and \u03bd e (\u03bd e ) appearance [40]. While their data favor a near-maximal value of \u03b8 23 , they disfavor CP conservation at 90% C.L., with a weak preference for normal mass hierarchy. These observations are broadly consistent with the NOvA result.",
