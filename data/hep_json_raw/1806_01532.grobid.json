It is based on proton-proton collision data collected by the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb \u22121 . No significant excess is observed over the Standard Model predictions and limits are set on the production cross section times branching ratio of a heavy vector particle produced either in quarkantiquark fusion or through vector-boson fusion. Constraints are also obtained on the mass and couplings of a singly charged Higgs boson, in the Georgi-Machacek model, produced through vector-boson fusion.",

Vector resonances are predicted in various BSM scenarios, such as in extended gauge models [1,2], Little Higgs models [3], Composite Higgs models and walking technicolor [4][5][6], unitarized Electroweak Chiral Lagrangian models [7], as well as in theories with extra dimensions [8][9][10]. In addition, new scalar diboson resonances result from models with an extended Higgs sector [11,12]. This Letter reports on a search for a W Z resonance in the fully leptonic decay channel \u03bd ( = e or \u03bc), produced either by quark-antiquark (qq) fusion or by vector-boson fusion (VBF). The proton-proton collision data were collected by the AT-LAS detector [13] at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at a centreof-mass energy \u221a s = 13 TeV.",

In Model A, weakly coupled vector resonances arise from an extension of the SM gauge group [49] with an additional SU(2) symmetry group and the branching fractions to fermions and gauge bosons are comparable. In Model B, the heavy vector triplet is produced in a strongly coupled scenario, as in a Composite Higgs model [50] and fermionic couplings are suppressed. The parameter g V was set to 1 for Model A and to 3 for Model B. For both models, the parameter c F is assumed to be the same for all types of fermions. Simulated signal samples for the HVT benchmark Model A were generated for masses of vector resonances ranging from 250 GeV to 3 TeV with MadGraph_aMC@NLO 2.2.2 [51], using the model file provided by the authors in Ref. [52] with the NNPDF23LO [53] PDF set. They are hadronized with Pythia 8.186. For interpretation in terms of Model B, the Model A cross sections are simply scaled. This is justified since the width remains well below the experimental resolution and the angular distributions are the same for both models.",

It is estimated to be below 6% in all mass bins for both the VBF and qq categories. The uncertainty associated with the choice of renormalization and factorization scales, \u03bc R and \u03bc F , is taken as the maximum downward and upward variation when the scales are varied independently by factors of 1/2 and 2. While these uncertainties can in principle affect the shape of the m W Z distribution, in practice the shape differences do not have a strong impact on the sensitivity of the search. The uncertainties are therefore treated as normalization uncertainties, taken to be 20% and 40% respectively. Shape systematic uncertainties associated with showering and hadronization of the QCD W Z are evaluated by comparing the Powheg-Box v2 samples interfaced with Pythia 8.186 and Herwig.

Apart from the statistical uncertainties in the data, the uncertainty with the largest impact on the sensitivity of the searches is related to the W Z background modelling. The numbers of background events are extracted through a background-only fit of the data in each category. Background contributions from prompt leptons, including their shapes, are taken from MC simulations. In the case of non-prompt leptons the background shapes are taken from the Matrix Method. In the fit, the normalisation of all backgrounds are allowed to vary within their uncertainties. The post-fit background yields are summarized in Table 2 for the qq and VBF categories. The fit constrains the SM W Z background estimate to the observed data, which reduces the Table 2 Expected and observed yields in the qq and VBF signal regions. Yields and uncertainties are evaluated after a background-only fit to the data in the qq or VBF signal regions after applying all selection criteria. The uncertainty in the total background estimate is smaller than the sum in quadrature of the individual background contributions due to anti-correlations between the estimates of different background sources. total background uncertainty, pulling the modelling uncertainties by less than one standard deviation from their pre-fit values. None of the nuisance parameters are significantly pulled or constrained relative to their pre-fit values in the background-only fit.

The local significances for signals of H \u00b1 5 and of a heavy vector W are 2.9 and 3.1 standard deviations, respectively. The respective global significances calculated using the Look Elsewhere method as in Ref. [78] and evaluated up to a mass of 900 GeV, are 1.6 and 1.9 standard deviations.

Isolation requirements are also applied to all muons, based on the ratio p varcone T /p \u03bc T , where p varcone T is the scalar sum of the transverse momenta of the tracks with p T > 1 GeV in a cone of size R = min(10 GeV/p \u03bc T , 0.3) around the muon, excluding the muon track itself. This isolation gives 99% efficiency, independently of \u03b7 or p \u03bc T , in Z \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc samples. Electron and muon candidates are required to originate from the primary vertex. Thus, the significance of the track's transverse impact parameter calculated relative to the beam line, |d 0 /\u03c3 d 0 |, must be less than three for muons and less than five for electrons, and the longitudinal impact parameter, z 0 (the difference between the value of z of the point on the track at which d 0 is defined and the longitudinal position of the primary vertex), is required to satisfy |z 0 \u2022 sin(\u03b8 )| < 0.5 mm. Jets are reconstructed from clusters of energy deposition in the calorimeter [64] using the anti-k t algorithm [65] with a radius parameter R = 0.4. Events with jets arising from detector noise or other non-collision sources are discarded [66]. This search considers jets with p T > 30 GeV in the range |\u03b7| < 4.5. Furthermore, to mitigate the pile-up contamination, a jet vertex tagger [67], based on information about tracks associated with the primary vertex and pile-up vertices, is applied to jets with p T < 60 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.4. The selected working point provides at least 92% efficiency. The energy of each jet is calibrated and corrected for detector effects using a combination of simulated events and in situ methods in 13 TeV data [68].",

Correction factors are applied to the simulated event samples to compensate for differences between data and simulation in the b-tagging efficiency for b-jets, c-jets and lightflavour jets.
