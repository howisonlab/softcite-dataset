Then VG method is used to analyze the fluctuation from a completely different perspective of complex network. This algorithm's scale-freeness detection mechanism to extract the Power-of-Scale-freeness-of-Visibility-Graph(PSVG), re-establishes the scale-freeness and fractality. Earlier, it has been shown that the scaling behavior is different from one hadron-nucleus(\u03c0 \u2212 -AgBr(350 GeV)) to one nucleus-nucleus( 32 S-AgBr(200 A GeV)) interaction which is of comparatively higher total energy [1]. In this work, we have compared the fluctuation pattern in terms of 3 rigorous parameters -Multifractalspectrum-width, Hurst exponent and PSVG, between Pb-Pb(2.76T eV per nucleon pair) data and either of \u03c0 \u2212 -AgBr(350 GeV) or 32 S-AgBr(200 A GeV) data, where both the interaction data are of significantly less energy than the ALICE data. We found that the values of the 3 parameters are substantially different for ALICE data compared to the other two interaction data. As remarkably different value of long-range-correlation indicates phase-transition, similar change in the fluctuation pattern in terms of these parameters can be attributed to a phase-transition and also the onset of QGP.",

Shuryak had suggested long back that, by studying matter in this phase referred as Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) phase [4] where quarks and gluons are not in confined state forming hadrons, one can have deeper insight into the basic properties of QCD matter in its normal state of confinement and also in the breaking process of chiral symmetry [5].",

Then there was further progress with the heavy-ion programme at the BNL RHIC [8,9] and the CERN SPS [10], which confirmed and fine-tuned the initial SPS results. The study of QCD at high temperatures embarked on a new age of precision measurements in 2010 with the start-up of LHC furnishing Pb-Pb collisions at the phenomenally high collision energies having magnitude far more than previously achieved.",

Different experimental observables have been optimized for probing dynamic evolution of the system and characterization of the various stages of the collision, to draw out the features of the produced matter. Conventionally, the initial state of a heavy-ion collision has been described utilizing the so-called Color Glass Condensate-CGC framework [11,12,13,14,15,16], where an over-occupied ensemble of soft gluons has been presented up to the so-called saturation scale and above that the states are nearly unoccupied. The progression of the system from that state towards hydrodynamic and ultimately fully thermalized state could be delineated by very weak and strong couplings respectively, using kinetic theory and numerical holography [17,18]. Although various attempts have been made, it has not been possible to detect the QGP directly. Hence it has been tried to obtain information about the initial state and the collision history, mostly from the final state hadrons measured in various experiments.",

So, one of the goals of the high-strength experiments at LHC, namely ALICE, ATLAS, CMS, and LHCb, has been measuring the parameters more precisely utilizing the high strength of LHC and thus characterizing the new state of matter. The increase of the collision energy at LHC gave rise to huge increase of the production of hard probes, giving access to a new set of observables and it has been the most crucial impact of LHC [19].",

An indication of a self-similar fluctuation is thereby obtained, which in turn indicated the fractal behaviors in statistical and geometrical systems. The study of fractal behavior of multipion production from the perspective of intermittent fluctuations using the method of factorial moment, had been an initial area of interest. There is a simple relationship between the anomalous fractal dimension and intermittency indices [21,22].

The most popular of them have been Gq moment and Tq moment developed by Hwa and Takagi [23,27]. Both these methods have been extensively applied to analyse the multipion emission process, after considering their merits and demerits [28,29]. Then techniques like the Detrended Fluctuation Analysis(DFA) method [30] have been introduced for detecting monofractal scaling parameters and the Hurst exponent, which is associated with fractal dimension inferred from the DFA function of a time-series [31]. This method has been used extensively for detecting long-range correlations in noisy and non-stationary time-series data [32,33]. Kantelhardt et al. [34] extended DFA to analyse non-stationary and multifractal time-series as a generalized version of DFA known as the multifractal-DFA (MF-DFA) method. The DFA and MF-DFA parameters have been used extensively for analyzing nonlinear, non-stationary data series for identifying their long-range correlations. The multifractal nature of the distribution of shower particles around central rapidity region of Au-Au collisions at \u221a s N N = 200A GeV, using MF-DFA method, was analysed by Zhang et al. [35]. A number of multifractal analysis of particle production processes has been also reported in the recent times [36,37,38,39].",

Albert and Barab\u00e1 have studied the latest advances in the field of complex network and examined the analytic tools and models for random graphs, small-world and scale-free networks, in the recent past [40,41]. Havlin et al. have discussed the application of network sciences to the analysis, perception, design and repair of multi-level complex systems which are detected in man-made and human social systems, in organic and inorganic matter, and in natural and anthropogenic structures [42].",

            "text": "Lacasa et al. have introduced Visibility Graph analysis [43,44] method which has gained importance due its entirely different, rigorous approach to assess fractality. Lacasa et al. have analysed real time series in different scientific fields, using fractional Brownian motion(fBm) and fractional Gaussian noises(fGn) series as a theoretical framework. The Hurst parameter calculated for fractional Brownian motion(fBm) with different methods, often yields ambiguous results, because of the presence of non-stationarity and long-range dependence in fractional Brownian motion(fBm). Lacasa et al. mapped fractional Brownian motion(fBm) and fractional Gaussian noises(fGn) series into a scale-free Visibility Graph having the degree distribution as a function of the Hurst exponent [44]. This way, they have applied classical method of complex network analysis to quantify long-range dependence and fractality of a time series [44]. The accuracy of Visibility Graph algorithm has been established for artificial data and real data series by Lacasa et al. and their details are given in [45,46]. This method has been used productively for analyzing various biological signals in recent works [47,48,49,50,51]. In view of the above, recently, using Visibility Graph method, we have analysed multiplicity fluctuation in (\u03c0 \u2212 -AgBr(350 GeV)) and ( 32 S-AgBr(200 A GeV)) interactions [1,52,53], the fractality of void probability distribution in ( 32 S-AgBr(200 A GeV)) interaction [48,54,55,56], analyzed the azimuthal anisotropy in ( 32 S-AgBr(200 A GeV)) interaction [57] and also proposed a new perspective of clan model of particle production process using this complex network scenario [58].",

Zhao et. al. have studied the fractal properties of magne-tization time series using MF-DFA and Visibility Graph method and confirmed Hurst exponent as a good indicator of phase transition for a complex system [60]. It's evident from the experiments for liquid-vapor-phase transition [59] and for magnetization time series [60], that in case of phase-transition, there would be a remarkable change in scaling behavior measured in terms of DFA, Hurst exponent, MF-DFA parameter and complex network parameter. Hence, in this work we have done the scaling analysis of the pseudorapidity data extracted from Pb-Pb VSD masterclass data sample at 2.76T eV per nucleon pair from ALICE Collaboration [61] using a completely different method of Visibility Graph from the perspective of complex network and also multifractal methodologies, to probe for phase transition and capture the signature of QGP.",

Also, one hadron-nucleus(\u03c0 \u2212 -AgBr(350 GeV)) interaction dataset and one nucleus-nucleus( 32 S-AgBr(200 A GeV)) dataset extracted from an interaction with comparatively higher energy than the hadron-nucleus interaction. For \u03c0 \u2212 -AgBr(350 GeV) interaction the pseudorapidity(\u03b7) coverage is 0.40 < \u03b7 < 6.50 and for 32 S-AgBr(200 A GeV) interaction this coverage is 0.90 < \u03b7 < 6.50(lab system), the details of which are given in our earlier works [65,54,55,1,52,56,53,58,57]. Each of these data series is analyzed using the methods described in Section 2. The method of analysis is described in detail in the Section 3.2.",

Then, for each of the 342, \u03b7-data series, randomized versions are generated and then their Hurst exponents and widths of the multifractal spectrum are calculated as per the process in Section 2.1. Then the values of the parameters are compared to those calculated for the experimental data. If the original data has long range correlations, that would be removed by the process of randomization and the data would become uncorrelated. So it's expected that the width of the multifractal spectrum and Hurst exponent for the randomized version would be remarkably different than those calculated for the experimental version. In the Figure 3, the Hurst exponent of the randomized version of the same ALICE data series is shown, where the value is calculated as 0.48 \u00b1 0.01.
