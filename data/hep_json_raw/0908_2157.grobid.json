The BESIII experiment has begun to collect data. I review the current and future experiments to be run in the charm region, in addition to selected topics in which the BESIII collaboration is expected to make substantial contributions to charm physics. I focus on two aspects of the program: D + and D + S leptonic decays 1 and studies of D 0 \u2192 K 0 S \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decays with their impact on the measurement of the CKM angle \u03b3/\u03c6 3 . While other measurements, e.g., semileptonic D 0 , D + , and D + S decays, quantum-correlated analyses, and rare D 0 and D + decays, are of great interest, they are not discussed here.",

The internal components consist of a 43-layer wire drift chamber (MDC), a time-of-flight (TOF) system with 2 layers in the barrel region and one layer for each endcap, and a 6272 cell CsI(Tl) crystal calorimeter (EMC). These components reside within a magnetic field aligned with the beam axis. A Muon Chamber (MUC) consists of 9 layers of resistive plate chambers within the return yoke of the magnet. The momentum resolution for charged tracks in the MDC is 0.5% for transverse momenta of 1 GeV/c. The energy resolution for showers in the EMC is \u223c 4% (2.3%) for 0.1 (1) GeV photons. Charged particle identification from measurements of ionization energy loss within the MDC and information from the TOF provides better than two standard deviations of separation for \u03c0 and K tracks with net momenta less than 900 MeV/c. The MUC provides reconstruction efficiencies of greater than 90% for track momenta in excess of 500 MeV/c. The BESIII detector was commissioned last year. As of April 2009, 100 million \u03c8(2S) decays have been collected. Table 1 lists the number of events for an average year with BEPCII running at design luminosities [1].",

BESIII may be sensitive to observing radiative leptonic decays. Predictions of B(D + \u2192 \u03b3 \u2113 + \u03bd \u2113 ) and B(D + S \u2192 \u03b3 \u2113 + \u03bd \u2113 ), where \u2113 = e, \u00b5, are in the range (0.1 \u2212 8.2) \u00d7 10 \u22125 [5] and (0.1 \u2212 9.0) \u00d7 10 \u22124 [5, 6], respectively. Using the data samples collected at E CM = M[\u03c8(3770)] and 4170 MeV described above, BESIII will be sensitive to the D + (D + S ) decay rates at the level of 1.1 \u00d7 10 \u22125 (1.4 \u00d7 10 \u22124 ). D 0 \u2192 K 0 S \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 AND IMPACT ON \u03b3/\u03c6 3 The most precise measurements of the angle \u03b3 are from B \u00b1 \u2192 D(K 0 S \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 )K \u00b1 decays, where D = D 0 or D 0 . Using 383 million BB decays the BaBar collaboration measured \u03b3 = [76 +23 \u221224 (stat) \u00b1 5(syst) \u00b1 5(model)] \u2022 [7], while the Belle collaboration determined a preliminary value of \u03b3 = [76 +12 \u221213 (stat) \u00b1 4(syst) \u00b1 9(model)] \u2022 [8] from 657 million BB decays. The model uncertainties arise from the isobar model analysis of flavor-tagged D \u2192 K 0",
