Many important results have been obtained, particularly in the kaon sector, light meson spectroscopy and on the precise measurement of the hadronic cross section below 1 GeV. During 2008 a new interaction scheme of DA\u03a6NE has been successfully tested, allowing to reach a peak luminosity of about 5\u00d710 32 cm \u22122 s \u22121 , a factor of 3 larger than previously obtained. Following this achievement, new data taking with an upgraded detector will start in 2010. To extend the precise measurement of the hadronic cross sections above 1 GeV a program for running DA\u03a6NE at energies up to 2.5 GeV has also been suggested. The improved KLOE detector is perfectly suited for taking data at energies different from the \u03c6 peak, while DA\u03a6NE will need some upgrade [2].",

Two different tagging detectors will be installed: the Low Energy Tagger, (low energy refers to the e \u00b1 energy) LET, made of two crystal calorimeters placed close to the DA\u03a6NE Interaction Point (IP) in symmetrical positions, and the High Energy Tagger, HET, made of two position sensitive detectors placed (symmetrically) far from the IP, after the first bending dipoles of DA\u03a6NE.

            "text": "CP T invariance is a fundamental theorem in quantum field theory. In several quantum gravity (QG) models, however, CP T can be violated via some mechanism which can also violate standard Quantum Mechanics (QM). In this respect the entagled neutral kaon pairs produced at DA\u03a6NE play a unique role in precision tests of the CP T symmetry [4]. As an example of this incredible precision reachable with neutral kaons, let us consider the model by Ellis, Hagelin, Nanopoulos and Srednicki (EHNS) which introduces three CP T and QMviolating real parameters \u03b1 \u03b2 and \u03b3 [5]. On phenomenological grounds, they are expected to be O(m 2 K /M P l ) \u223c 2\u00d710 \u221220 GeV at most, being M P l \u223c 10 19 GeV, the Planck mass. Interestingly enough, this model gives rise to observable effects in the behaviour of entagled neutral meson systems, as shown also in [6], that can be experimentally tested. With 2.5 f b \u22121 KLOE has published competitive results on these issues [7]. The analysis makes use of correlated K 0 L \u2212 K 0 S pairs, by measuring the relative distance of their decay point into two charged pions. The decay region most sensitive to the EHNS parameters is the one close to the IP.  Figure 2 shows the potential limits that can be obtained by KLOE on \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3 as a function of the integrated luminosity, both with and without the insertion of an inner tracker with vertex resolution of 0.25 \u03c4 S (to be compared with the present KLOE vertex resolution, 0.9 \u03c4 S ). In the figure are also given the results from CPLEAR [8]. Without giving too many details, it is clear that with a reasonable integrated luminosity, KLOE-2 can set the best limits on these parameter.",

KLOE exploited the radiative decays \u03c6 \u2192 P P \u03b3 to study f 0 (980) and a 0 (980), and to look for a signal of the \u03c3(600), and extracted the parameters of the scalar resonances from the two pseudoscalar invarant mass distributions [15,16]. Substantial improvements from KLOE-2 are expected for \u03c6 \u2192 (f 0 /a 0 )\u03b3 \u2192 K 0K 0 \u03b3: the KLOE upper limit, Br(\u03c6 \u2192 K 0K 0 \u03b3) < 1.9 \u00d7 10 \u22128 [17], can be lowered, with the KLOE-2 statistics, down to 1\u00d710 \u22128 . This limit can be further reduced to 0.5\u00d710 \u22128 with the insertion of the inner tracker. This value is in the range of the theoretical predictions for the branching ratio, then the first observation of this decay is possible at KLOE-2. In \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03b7\u03c0\u03c0 decays the \u03c0\u03c0 system has the same quantum numbers of a scalar meson. Moreover, the available kinetic energy of the \u03c0\u03c0 system is in the range (0, 137) MeV, suppressing high angular momentum contributions, and the exchange of vector mesons is forbidden by G-parity conservation. For these reasons only scalar mesons can participate in the scattering amplitude. The decay can be mediated by the scalar (\u03c3,a 0 and f 0 ) exchange and by a direct contact term due to the chiral anomaly [18]. The scalar contribution can be determined from a fit to the Dalitz plot. A Monte Carlo simulation of the \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03b7\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 process shows that KLOE-2 has a good sensitivity to \u03c3(600).",

            "text": "In the last years the improved precision reached in the measurement of e + e \u2212 annihilation cross sections in the energy range below a few GeV has led to a substantial reduction on the uncertainty of the hadronic contribution to the effective fine-structure constant at the scale M Z , \u2206\u03b1 (5) had (M 2 Z ), and to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon a HLO \u00b5 [23,24]. However, while below 1 GeV the error on the two-pion channel which dominates the cross section in this energy range is below 1%, the region between 1 and 2 GeV is still poorly known, with a fractional accuracy of \u223c 10%. Since this region contributes about 40% [25] to the total error of \u2206\u03b1 (5) had (M 2 Z ) (and up to \u223c 70% by using the Adler function as proposed in [25]), and about 55% [26] to the error of a HLO \u00b5 , it is evident how desirable an improvement on this region is [3]. KLOE-2 can play a major role by measuring in this energy region the hadronic cross section at 1-2% level. With a specific luminosity of 10 32 cm \u22122 s \u22121 , DA\u03a6NE upgraded in energy can perform a scan in the region from 1 to 2.5 GeV, collecting an integrated luminosity of 20 pb \u22121 per point (corresponding to a few days of data taking). By assuming an energy step of 25 MeV, the whole region would be scanned in one year of data taking.  As shown in Fig. 4 the statistical yield will be one order of magnitude higher than with 1 ab \u22121 at BaBar, and better than BES-3. Figure 5 shows the statistical error for the channels \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 , 2\u03c0 + 2\u03c0 \u2212 and \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 K + K \u2212 , which can be achieved by an energy scan at DA\u03a6NE upgraded in energy with 20 pb \u22121 per point, compared with BaBar with published (89 fb \u22121 ), and tenfold (890 fb \u22121 ) statistics. As can be seen, an energy scan allows to reach a statistical accuracy of order of 1% for most of the energy points. (In addition, KLOE-2 can benefit from the high machine luminosity to use ISR as well). The detector hermeticity, the high granularity of the calorimeter, the excellent momentum resolution of the drift chamber and the insertion of the inner tracker would allow to reduce the systematic error to the same level. The beam energy can be determined with an error less than 100 keV, by using the Compton backscattering (CBS) of laser photons against the electron beam.",

This would represent a factor two improvement on the current error of a HLO \u00b5 , which is necessary in order to match the increased precision of the proposed muon g-2 experiments at FNAL [27] and J-PARC [28].",

The insertion of an inner tracker and calorimeters in the forward regions are planned for the end of 2011. KLOE-2 will start data taking in Spring 2010, and will take data for at least 3 years. The physics program is wide, spanning from studies on neutral kaon quantum interferometry to precise measurement of hadronic cross sections in the energy range below 2.5 GeV. It will have a major impact in many tests of the Standard Model (like the g \u2212 2 of the muon), tests of discrete symmetries, and searches for new physics.",
