The excess is characterized and found to be consistent with neutral-current \u03c0 0 production with a broad energy distribution peaking at 7 GeV and a total cross section of 0.26 \u00b1 0.02(stat) \u00b1 0.08(sys) \u00d7 10 \u221239 cm 2 . The angular distribution, electromagnetic shower energy, and spatial distribution of the energy depositions of the excess are consistent with expectations from neutrino neutral-current diffractive \u03c0 0 production from hydrogen in the hydrocarbon target. These data comprise the first direct experimental observation and constraint for a reaction that poses an important background process in neutrino oscillation experiments searching for \u03bd \u00b5 to \u03bd e oscillations.",

            "text": "In a separate paper, the MINERvA collaboration reported a measurement of \u03bd e CC quasielastic and quasielastic-like scattering in the NuMI beam at an average neutrino energy of 3.6 GeV [6]. During the data analysis leading to those results, an unexpectedly large number of events was observed containing electromagnetic showers likely caused by photon conversions. In this Letter, this excess of events is measured relative to the expectation based on a sample of simulated data produced using current state-of-the-art models of neutrino production and interactions. These events are seen to exhibit features expected of so-called neutral current (NC) \"diffractive\" \u03c0 0 production from hydrogen in the hydrocarbon target, thus named because it results from the coherence of particle wavefunctions in analogy with classical diffraction resulting from coherent electromagnetic waves. [7] These results constitute the first direct experimental observation and characterization of this process. An analogous process that happens exclusively on nuclei heavier than hydrogen, NC coherent \u03c0 0 production, has been observed previously [8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15]; however, the contribution from NC diffractive scattering from hydrogen, when present in the target, has been considered only inclusively with the scattering from the heavier nuclei and not examined separately as is done here. This measurement offers an experimental constraint on models of NC diffractive \u03c0 0 production and the A-dependence of coherent scattering. It is of general interest in neutrino physics and of particular importance for oscillation experiments using detectors containing water or hydrocarbons or any other material containing hydrogen.",

To remove the overwhelming background from \u03bd \u00b5 CC events, tracks are not considered if they exit the back of the detector as muons are expected to do. Candidate electromagnetic showers are identified by examining energy depositions within a region that consists of the union of two volumes: a cylinder of radius 50 mm extending from the event vertex along the track direction and a 7.5 \u2022 cone with an apex at the event vertex (origin of track) and a symmetry axis along the track direction. The full region (referred to below as the 'shower cone') extends in length through the scintillator and electromagnetic calorimeter portions of MINERvA until it reaches a gap of approximately three radiation lengths along the cone where no significant energy is deposited. This shower cone object is evaluated using a multivariate particle identification (PID) algorithm which combines details of the energy deposition pattern both longitudinally (mean dE/dx and the fraction of energy at the downstream end of cone) and transverse to the axis of the cone (mean shower width) using a k-nearest-neighbors (kNN) algorithm [24].",

Here, the energy in the dE/dx measure is taken to be the minimum energy contained in a 100 mm window along the shower, where the downstream end of the window is allowed to slide up to 500 mm from the vertex. This sliding window technique reduces any potential bias induced by nuclear activity near the interaction point [25]. Figure 1 shows the minimum dE/dx during this process for both the data and simulation. For comparison, the inset of Fig. 1 shows the same variable for simulated samples of single photons or electrons, chosen with a flat energy distribution in the range from 0.5 to 5.0 GeV. Electron showers tend to lie in an interval between 1 and 2 MeV/cm, while the photons populate a somewhat wider range peaking at 3 MeV/cm. The MINERvA modeling of photons and electrons was validated against the data successfully with samples of separated \u03c0 0 conversion photons and Michel electrons [17].",

In addition, Fig. 1 shows that the excess is not compatible with an overall normalization offset of the sample. The possibility of the excess arising from mismodeled non-shower activity near the event vertex (i.e., nucleons) was examined by injecting extra protons into simulated electron showers in a fashion consistent with the findings in recent MINERvA muon neutrino scattering results [25] (uniformly from 0-225 MeV in 25% of the simulated showers). These samples did not exhibit an excess in the photon region of the reconstructed dE/dx distribution.

In each of these samples, the events falling into the region of the photon-like excess in dE/dx were generated to have the same two dimensional distribution of energy and angle as in the data excess. Figure 2(a) shows a shape comparison for the \"extra energy ratio\" variable \u03a8, which represents the relative amount of energy outside the cone to that inside the cone, for these single-particle samples compared to the distribution of the excess in the data. Energy depositions within 30 cm of the interaction vertex were ignored when calculating \u03a8 to reduce the contribution from low-energy nucleons, which may not be simulated correctly [25]. Here, the data are more consistent with photon or \u03c0 0 production than \u03b7 production. On the other hand, Fig. 2(b) shows the median transverse width of the energy depositions in the cone object (\"median shower width\") for the singleparticle samples and the excess in the data. In this case, the data are less consistent with the behavior expected from a single particle than with that from a particle decaying into multiple photons. These single-particle studies along with the Michel and injected proton studies mentioned above, suggest that the showers in the excess are most likely caused by photons from \u03c0 0 production and subsequent decay.",

Figure 3 shows shape comparisons of GENIE NC coherent and incoherent \u03c0 0 production with data distributions from the excess in several variables, where the content of each curve is normalized to unity. Figure 3(a) gives the reconstructed energy the electromagnetic shower, E shower , where it can be seen that the data excess has a harder energy spectrum than the NC processes predicted by the model. However, the angular distribution of the shower in the data agrees very well in shape with the expectation from GENIE for NC coherent \u03c0 0 production, as demonstrated in the E shower \u03b8 2 distribution (Fig. 3(b)). The same is true in \u03a8, as illustrated in Fig. 3(c), as most of the events have relatively little energy outside the cone. However, the distribution of energy within a cone identical to the one described in Sec. III, except oriented backward along the  original cone axis, is different. In this case, illustrated in Fig. 3(d), the data appear to have more in-line upstream energy than the NC coherent process and are more consistent with the NC incoherent process, suggesting a small nuclear recoil from the neutrino interaction.",

Interpretations of the excess as arising from errors in the flux or background predictions, or mismodeling of the electromagnetic shower process, are disfavored based on in situ sideband constraints. The observed process resembles coherent production apart from the existence of a small amount of upstream energy, implying that the events likely arise from diffractive pion production from hydrogen. The measured cross section for this process for E \u03c0 > 3 GeV , assuming the observed shower to come from photon conversions from the \u03c0 0 , is comparable to that for NC coherent \u03c0 0 production from carbon. These measurements, interpreted as NC diffractive scattering, constitute the first direct experimental observation and characterization of this process. Neutrino oscillation experiments with hydrogen in their targets must account for NC diffractive scattering in order to correctly model backgrounds to \u03bd e appearance. The data presented above will play an essential role in constraining models for diffractive production, such as the model in Ref. [26]. But because the latter applies only at larger W, this work also highlights the need for models of diffractive scattering which extend to low W and E \u03c0 to be developed and incorporated in simulations.
