The signal is extracted through a maximum-likelihood fit to the distribution of a multivariate discriminant defined using boosted decision trees to separate the expected signal contribution from background processes. The analysis uses data collected at centre-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 TeV and corresponding to integrated luminosities of 5.1 and 19.7 fb \u22121 , respectively. The measured cross sections of 7.1 \u00b1 8.1 pb (at 7 TeV) and 13.4 \u00b1 7.3 pb (at 8 TeV) result in a best fit value of 2.0 \u00b1 0.9 for the combined ratio of the measured and expected values. The signal significance is 2.5 standard deviations, and the upper limit on the rate relative to the standard model expectation is 4.7 at 95% confidence level.",

The first uncertainty corresponds to a doubling and halving of the renormalization and factorization scales. The second uncertainty is from the choice of parton distribution functions (PDFs) at the 90% confidence level (CL). All three single top quark production channels, shown in figure 1, are directly related to the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix element V tb , providing a direct measurement of this SM parameter. The s channel production process is of special interest since a possible deviation from the SM prediction of its cross section may indicate the presence of mechanisms beyond the standard model (BSM), as predicted by models that involve the exchange of a non-SM mediator, such as a W boson or a charged Higgs boson [7]. A review of deviations from SM predictions for s and t channel modes in BSM scenarios can be found in ref. [8].",

Only the decays of the W boson into a muon or an electron ( = \u00b5, e) and a corresponding neutrino are considered. Decays of the W boson into a tau lepton and a neutrino, where the tau lepton subsequently decays into a muon or an electron, are regarded as part of the signal. Events are selected considering the kinematic properties of physical objects reconstructed in the final state. Three statistically independent analysis categories are therefore defined, according to the number and flavour of the reconstructed jets. Dedicated strategies are used in data to estimate and reject multijet backgrounds. The procedure for signal extraction consists of a simultaneous fit to the distributions of multivariate discriminants trained separately in each analysis category on a set of kinematic variables that show separation between signal and background.",
