For example, states with four quarks and an antiquark, referred to as pentaquarks [3], have been searched for experimentally for many years. As observed with the LHCb detector at the LHC, the distribution of invariant mass of the J/\u03c8 p system in \u039b 0 b \u2192 J/\u03c8 (\u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 )pK \u2212 decays shows a narrow peak suggestive of uudcc pentaquark formation [4][5][6]. (The inclusion of charge conjugate processes is implied throughout the text.) From a six-dimensional amplitude model fit, two pentaquark resonances, decaying into J/\u03c8 p, are observed with large significances [4].",

The LHCb detector [12,13] is a single-arm forward spectrometer covering the pseudorapidity range 2 < \u03b7 < 5, designed for the study of particles containing b or c quarks. The detector includes a high-precision tracking system consisting of a silicon-strip vertex detector (VELO) surrounding the pp interaction region, a large-area silicon-strip detector located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4 Tm, and three stations of silicon-strip detectors and straw drift tubes placed downstream of the magnet. The tracking system provides a measurement of momentum, p, of charged particles with a relative uncertainty that varies from 0.5% at low momentum to 1.0% at 200 GeV/c. The minimum distance of a track to a primary vertex (PV), the impact parameter (IP), is measured with a resolution of (15 + 29/p T ) \u03bcm, where p T is the component of the momentum transverse to the beam, in GeV/c. Different types of charged hadrons are distinguished using information from two ring-imaging Cherenkov (RICH) detectors. Photons, electrons and hadrons are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter and a hadronic calorimeter. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers.",

The simulated samples are reweighted in bins of p T and rapidity, in order to reproduce the data distribution of \u039b 0 b decays, and the relative efficiency is recalculated. The correction factor of this source is 1.138. The value is consistent if separately correcting for the LL and DD samples. The product of the two correction factors for the average efficiency is 1.115. The uncertainties in the correction factors are taken as systematic uncertainties discussed below.   Table 1. The quoted values are averages over the LL IP for \u039b candidates in the DD category, are well modelled. The simulation is then smeared for these two variables to match the data, and the small change of 0.1% in the relative efficiency is taken as systematic uncertainty. The uncertainty due to the kaon PID efficiency is studied by changing the binning scheme in momentum, pseudorapidity and event multiplicity. The alternative binning gives a 1.0% difference in the signal efficiency, which is assigned as a systematic uncertainty. The tracking efficiency is estimated from simulation and calibrated with the data [30]; an uncertainty of 0.4% is assigned for the kaon track. An additional systematic uncertainty of 1.1% is assigned to the kaon tracking efficiency due to an imperfect knowledge of the material budget in the detector [5]. It is estimated from simulation by changing the used interaction length in the detector by 10%. The total tracking-efficiency related systematic uncertainty, adding the two contributions in quadrature, is 1.2%. The systematic uncertainty of the average efficiency defined in Eq. (2) is 1.5%, calculated by propagating the statistical uncertainties for the efficiencies over the phase space. In reweighting the simulated p T and y spectra to match the data, an uncertainty of 1.5% is estimated by varying the weights for each kinematic bin by its uncertainty. The uncertainties in the \u039b 0 b lifetime of 1.468 \u00b1 0.012 ps [31] and the \u039e \u2212 b lifetime of 1.57 \u00b1 0.04 ps [9], result in relative changes of \u00b10.2% and \u00b11.1% in the efficiencies, respectively. The limited size of the simulated samples gives rise to an uncertainty of 0.7%. Varying the mass resolution ratios of the \u039e b to \u039b 0 b mass peaks, which are fixed in the nominal fit to the data, results in an uncertainty of 0.6%. The uncertainty due to the trigger efficiency is cancelled between the signal and control modes, as the trigger requirements are imposed only on the muon pairs. Finally, the total relative systematic uncertainty is 3.5%, obtained by adding all of the above contributions in quadrature.",

The \u039e \u2212 b and \u039b 0 b candidates are formed from a J/\u03c8 and a \u039b candidate, combined with a kaon candidate for the \u039e \u2212 b baryon, where the kaon candidate must have p T > 250 MeV/c and large \u03c7 2 IP . Each reconstructed b-baryon candidate is required to have \u03c7 < 25 with respect to at least one PV, and is associated to the one which the \u03c7 2 IP is smallest. The candidate decay vertex must also have a fit with good \u03c7 2 and a separation of at least 1.5 mm from the PV. The angle, \u03b8 , between the b-baryon momentum and the vector from the associated PV to the decay vertex must satisfy cos \u03b8 > 0.999. For both b baryons fiducial cuts of p T < 25 GeV/c and rapidity in the range 2.0 < y < 4.5 are required to have a well-defined kinematic region in which the measurement is performed. There are only 0.2% events outside the fiducial kinematic region. A kinematic fit [24] is applied to the \u039e \u2212 b and \u039b 0 b candidates, with the J/\u03c8 and \u039b masses constrained to the known values [9], and the b-baryon candidate constrained to point back to its PV. As a result, the mass resolution is improved by 60%, with most of the improvement coming from the constraints on the J/\u03c8 and \u039b masses. The \u039e \u2212 b \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u039bK \u2212 and \u039b 0 b \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u039b candidates passing the preselection are filtered with a BDTG to further suppress the combinatorial background. For the \u039e \u2212 b decay, the following discriminating variables are used: the minimum DLL \u03bc\u03c0 (defined as the difference in the logarithms of the likelihood values from the particle identification systems [25] for the muon and pion hypotheses) and the minimum p T within the muon pair; the \u03c7 2 IP of all other final-state tracks and the \u039b baryon; the p T of the p, \u03c0 , K and J/\u03c8 candidates; the decay length and the vertex fit \u03c7 2 of the \u039b candidate; the \u03c7 2 of the kinematic fit, cos \u03b8 and the decay time of the \u039e \u2212 b baryon. The BDTG is trained on a simulated \u039e \u2212 b \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u039bK \u2212 sample for the signal; data candidates with 5944 < m( J/\u03c8 \u039bK ) < 6094 MeV/c 2 are used to model the background. The LL and DD samples are trained separately. The optimal working point on the BDTG response and the PID variable of the kaon is determined by maximising the significance of the expected \u039e \u2212 b signal, S/ \u221a S + B, where S (B) is the expected signal (background) yield in a range corresponding to \u00b12.5 times the mass resolution at the known \u039e \u2212 b mass [9]. The S value is calculated as the product of an initial signal yield determined from the data at BDTG > 0, and the relative efficiency with respect to the BDTG selection obtained from the simulation. The value of B is estimated from the data sidebands. The final BDTG working point has a signal efficiency of 90% (70%) and a background rejection rate of 97% (99%) for LL (DD) samples. The normalisation channel uses a separate training for the BDTG, where the variables for the K \u2212 meson are excluded. The background training sample is taken from the J/\u03c8 \u039b invariant mass regions with 150 < |m( J/\u03c8 \u039b) \u2212 m \u039b 0 b | < 350 MeV/c 2 , where m \u039b 0 b is the known \u039b 0 b mass [9]. The optimal requirement on the BDTG response for the normalisation mode is the same as for the signal channel. For both samples, in 0.3% of the cases multiple candidates are found, all of which are retained in the analysis.",

An offline selection is applied after the trigger, based on a loose preselection, followed by a multivariate classifier based on a Gradient Boosted Decision Tree (BDTG)[23].In the preselection, the J/\u03c8 candidates are formed from twooppositely charged particles with p T > 500 MeV/c, identified as muons and consistent with originating from a common vertex but inconsistent with originating from any PV.
