            "text": "The MoEDAL experiment is designed to search for magnetic monopoles and other highly-ionising particles produced in high-energy collisions at the LHC. The largely passive MoEDAL detector, deployed at Interaction Point 8 on the LHC ring, relies on two dedicated direct detection techniques. The first technique is based on stacks of nucleartrack detectors with surface area \u223c18 m 2 , sensitive to particle ionisation exceeding a high threshold. These detectors are analysed offline by optical scanning microscopes. The second technique is based on the trapping of charged particles in an array of roughly 800 kg of aluminium samples. These samples are monitored offline for the presence of trapped magnetic charge at a remote superconducting magnetometer facility. We present here the results of a search for magnetic monopoles using a 160 kg prototype MoEDAL trapping detector exposed to 8 TeV proton-proton collisions at the LHC, for an integrated luminosity of 0.75 fb \u22121 . No magnetic charge exceeding 0.5g D (where g D is the Dirac magnetic charge) is measured in any of the exposed samples, allowing limits to be placed on monopole production in the mass range 100 GeV\u2264 m \u2264 3500 GeV. Model-independent cross-section limits are presented in fiducial regions of monopole energy and direction for 1g D \u2264 |g| \u2264 6g D , and model-dependent cross-section limits are obtained for Drell-Yan pair production of spin-1/2 and spin-0 monopoles for 1g D \u2264 |g| \u2264 4g D . Under the assumption of Drell-Yan cross sections, mass limits are derived for |g| = 2g D and |g| = 3g D for the first time at the LHC, surpassing the results from previous collider experiments.",

            "text": "Once the unification of electricity and magnetism was achieved by James Clerk Maxwell [1], it was natural to hypothesise the existence of isolated magnetic charge -the counterparts of electric charge -that would symmetrise Maxwell's equations and complete the electricmagnetic duality. One of the first to recognise that magnetic monopoles could conceivably exist was Pierre Curie [2]. Interest in the existence of magnetic monopoles greatly increased when Dirac showed that electric charge quantisation could be explained as a natural consequence of angular momentum quantisation in the presence of a monopole [3]. A paradigm shift in our understanding of magnetic monopoles occurred in 1974 when 't Hooft and Polyakov independently showed that certain spontaneously-broken gauge theorieswhere the U(1) subgroup of electromagnetism is embedded into a gauge group that is spontaneously broken by the Higgs mechanism -necessarily possess a topological magnetic monopole solution [4,5]. Thus monopoles are now not just a possibility but a prediction of such theories. More recently it has been proposed that magnetic monopole solutions could arise within the electroweak theory itself [6]. This Cho-Maison or electroweak monopole would be expected to have a mass of the order of several TeV [7][8][9], possibly within reach of the LHC.",

            "text": "It follows from Dirac's argument that the magnetic charge q m carried by a monopole should be a multiple of the fundamental Dirac  where e is the electric charge of the proton, \u03b1 e is the fine structure constant, n is an integer and g D is the Dirac unit of magnetic charge. In SI units, the dimensionless quantity g 1 is related to the magnetic charge q m by the relation q m = gec where c is the speed of light in vacuo. The large value of the Dirac charge, g D = 68.5, implies that the minimum coupling of a monopole to the photon should be much larger than 1, preventing reliable perturbative calculations of monopole production processes. According to Dirac's theory, the minimum value of the magnetic charge is g D if the fundamental charge is e, and would become 3g D if free particles with charge 1 3 e were to exist [11]. Schwinger proposed a magnetic model of matter based on dyons whose magnetic charge is at least 2g D [12]. The minimum magnetic charge is g D or 2g D when the monopole is a topological object such as the grand-unification monopole [4] or the electroweak monopole [6]. In all cases the lightest magnetic monopole is stable by virtue of magnetic charge conservation. The in-flight ionisation energy loss of a relativistic monopole with a single Dirac charge is equivalent to that of a relativistic electrically-charged particle with |z| \u2248 68.5, where z is the number of elementary charges e. Thus, a relativistic monopole would induce an ionisation in matter over 4700 times higher than a minimum-ionising particle [13][14][15].",

            "text": "Accelerator-based experiments designed to search for magnetic monopoles are carried out at each advance of the high-energy frontier [16,17]. Astroparticle experiments have also played a key role in the monopole quest at the cosmic frontier [18]. At colliders, monopoles would be produced in pairs and manifest themselves as very highly-ionising particles. The monopoles produced would quickly slow down and get trapped in the material surrounding the interaction points. An indisputable test for the presence of a trapped magnetic monopole in matter would be the measurement of a persistent current induced when a sample is passed through the superconducting coil of a SQUID magnetometer [16,18]. This induction technique relies on the assumption that monopole binding to matter is stronger than the forces which are subsequently applied to the samples, such as the gravitational and magnetic pulls from the Earth. The use of ferromagnetic material, which would guarantee binding via the mirror image force [19,20], is not practical in the present search for two reasons: such material can cause physical damage by moving freely when exposed to magnetic fields in the LHC caverns, and its large magnetic moments can cause SQUID magnetometer instabilities. The search therefore relies on strong monopole binding to matter through interactions with atoms or nuclei. This is a reasonable assumption for nuclei with non-zero magnetic dipole moments such as aluminium, which are expected to bind with monopoles with binding energies of the order of hundreds of keV [21].",

These results are valid for magnetic charges up to |g| = 1.5g D and electric charges up to |z| = 60. However, certain caveats apply here. The general-purpose LHC detectors ATLAS and CMS are designed and optimised to detect relativistic electricallycharged particles and energetic neutral particles such as photons and neutrons. In the case of very highly-ionising particles the performance of these detectors has not been experimentally assessed and calibrated. Consequently, their response to highly-ionising particles is estimated using simulations.",

MoEDAL's relatively open intersection region at Interaction Point 8 (IP8) results in a low material budget for the passage of highly-ionising particles. Importantly, the MoEDAL detector response to highly-ionising particles is directly calibrated using heavy-ion beams. Another crucial feature of the MoEDAL detector is the absence of backgrounds. Standard Model particles may induce reactions within the NTD plates that fog the image but can never simulate a signal of new physics. Likewise, there is no possible way that Standard Model backgrounds can mimic the signal of a trapped monopole. MoEDAL can directly JHEP08(2016)067 measure magnetic charge in a robust way. The complementary nature of the MoEDAL detector, its minimisation of experimental assumptions and its well understood response -exemplified by its ability to retain a permanent record, and even capture new particles for further study -makes MoEDAL an invaluable asset in the elucidation of any Terascale new physics scenario covered by its extensive physics programme [10].",

It was deployed immediately underneath the beam pipe directly upstream of the LHCb VELO detector vacuum vessel. Aluminium is a particularly good choice for the trapping volume material for four important reasons. First, the large magnetic moment of the 27 13 Al nucleus means that it is expected to bind strongly with a monopole, thus capturing it inside the atomic lattice [21] (see further discussion in section 4.2). Secondly, aluminium does not present a problem with respect to activation. Thirdly, aluminium is non-magnetic, which favours the stability of the SQUID magnetometer during measurements. Last but not least, it presents a readily available and cost-effective solution.",

This represents on average 2.3% of the total radiation length. To model material uncertainties, two additional material geometries were utilised, based on conservative estimates of the maximum and minimum amount of material that could be plausibly unaccounted for due to uncertainties in the material budget. These geometries were implemented by changing the grid rod radius to 0.01 cm (minimum extra material) and 0.5 cm (maximum extra material), respectively.

The magnetometer response was measured to be linear and charge symmetric in a range corresponding to 0.1 \u2212 300g D .

A calibration dipole sample of well-known magnetic moment was measured at the start of each run, with current values found to be consistent within 1%, ensuring that the calibration constant remained stable.

Magnetic dipole impurities inside the sample and the sample holder can induce currents in the coils. Figure 2 shows measurements with one 20 cm sample at 76 different positions before, during and after passage through the sensing coils, after subtracting the same measurements with an empty sample holder. It can be noted that the magnetisation of the sample holder itself is of the same order as the typical sample magnetisation. This provides an example of a typical magnetometer response profile as a function of sample position. An emulation of the response expected if a positive or negative monopole was present in the sample is given in the figure by adding or subtracting measurements obtained with a long solenoid scaled to the current expected from a Dirac monopole I g D . With a monopole present a persistent current substantially different from zero would be recorded.

Instabilities can be caused by several known instrumental and environmental factors, including: spurious flux jumps occurring when the slew rate is increased [40] as, for instance, when a sample contains ferromagnetic impurities or when a large sample is passed through the sensing coil at a high speed; noise currents in the SQUID feedback loop; the accumulation of condensed water and ice in the JHEP08(2016)067  magnetometer tube near the cold sensing region; physical vibrations and shocks; small (\u223cmm) variations in the initial position of the sample holder from one run to another; and variations in external magnetic fields, in particular the geomagnetic field but also possibly fields from high-voltage power line activity in the vicinity of the laboratory. Smooth variations in external magnetic fields also cause the current offset to drift, typically by a value corresponding to 0.05g D in the course of one hour. Precautions taken at regular intervals in order to minimise SQUID coil current jumps and drifts include: cleaning the SQUID magnetometer tube through which the sample and sample holder pass; resetting the SQUID current offset; and performing frequent empty holder measurements. Such safeguards help mitigate the impact of systematic effects on the magnetic charge resolution. The magnetic charge measurements made for all 606 samples of the trapping detector as measured by the first measurement -or the first subsequent measurement in the cases where a spurious offset jump was observed for the first measurement -are shown in figure 4. The upper plot gives an idea of the evolution of the resolution with time, where periods of relative instability are observed for the 10th and 17th of September, which can be attributed to sub-optimal conditions during the measurements for these particular runs. The clearly visible saw tooth feature recorded on the 11th September is due to a relative scarcity of available empty holder measurements, resulting into less frequent offset drift corrections. The bottom plot shows the data as a histogram. No measurements yield values of |g| beyond 0.18g D .",

This model, which ignores the non-perturbative nature of the process due to the large coupling between the monopole and the photon, is chosen by virtue of its simplicity and used to provide an interpretation of the search. Examples of the resulting distributions in the plane described by the longitudinal kinetic energy E kin z = E kin \u2022 sin(\u03b8) and polar angle \u03b8 are shown in figure 6. The use of spin-0 monopoles in addition to spin-1/2, which results in distinctly different DY kinematics due to phase-space constraints resulting from angular momentum conservation, provides an estimate of the model dependence of the detector acceptance. Pythia 6 [43] is used for the initial-state QCD radiation and the hadronisation of the underlying event. Single-monopole samples are also generated with a flat kinetic energy distribution ranging from 0 to 10000 GeV to obtain model-independent results.

Indeed, a few models, summarised in ref. [48], estimate that binding should occur for 27 13 Al (100% natural abundance). The large and positive anomalous magnetic moment of aluminium makes it a good choice for the MoEDAL trapping detector with a predicted monopole-nucleus binding energy in the range 0.5 \u2212 2.5 MeV [48][49][50][51]. Although the angular-momentum criterion for monopole binding is straightforward it is clear that current theory of monopole binding to nuclear magnetic dipole moments relies on a number of assumptions [48]. However, the estimated binding energies given above are large and comparable to shell model splittings. Thus, it is reasonable to believe that in the strong magnetic field in the vicinity of the monopole the nucleus will undergo nuclear rearrangement, in general allowing the monopole to bind to the nuclear, or even the subnuclear, constituents. Also, even a very conservative estimate for the binding energy of 1 eV would give a lifetime of 10 yr [21,48]. There is, therefore, good reason to believe that monopoles would be securely captured in MoEDAL's aluminium trapping volumes.",

Monopoles with higher charges and/or low energies tend to range out before they reach the trapping detector, and are thus only trapped in regions of low upstream material. Also, for the same charge and the same kinetic energy, monopoles with lower masses possess a higher velocity, leading to higher dE/dx, and thus tend to lose their energy earlier.

These two variables are chosen here as the longitudinal kinetic energy E kin z and the polar angle \u03b8. Particle-gun Monte-Carlo samples are used to map the acceptance for all mass and charge combinations as a function of E kin z and \u03b8 (with \u22122.7 rad < \u03c6 < \u22120.5 rad, corresponding the \u03c6 range of the detector), as shown in figure 8 for monopoles with m = 1000 GeV. These two-dimensional histograms contain all the information needed to obtain the acceptance for any given pair-production model to a good approximation, for example the Drell-Yan production model (see below). In order to present these data in a clear and simple way (at the cost of some precision, and conservatively neglecting low-acceptance regions) the information can be condensed by considering only the regions in which the acceptance is reasonably high called fiducial regions. An average efficiency of 0.4 is chosen for the fiducial region definition as a trade-off between specifying a large enough region and keeping a uniform acceptance within the region.",

While the VELO vacuum vessel is modelled with great precision in the LHCb geometry, detailed technical drawings of cables and pipes present downstream of the VELO, as well as the interiors of elements such as a vacuum pump and a vacuum manifold, are not available. Consequently, material comprising these elements was estimated by inspection and direct measurement. Two geometry models are used to obtain estimates of the systematic error due to our imperfect knowledge of the material. These models describe the minimum and maximum amounts of material assuming conservative uncertainties on material thicknesses and densities (see section 2 for details). This results in a roughly 25% relative uncertainty in the lower and higher E kin z boundaries of the fiducial regions used for the model-independent analysis described above (figure 9). The systematic uncertainty in the material map also results in uncertainties in DY acceptances. With |g| = g D , the resulting relative uncertainty is of the order of 10%.

However, they are useful as a benchmark by which the present results can be compared with those of other experiments. The corresponding mass limits are shown in table 2 for magnetic charges up to 3g D for spin-1/2 and spin-0 DY monopoles. The mass limits obtained for |g| = g D are about a factor two lower than the recent ATLAS results at 8 TeV obtained under the same assumptions for monopole production [34]. However, mass limits for DY pair produced monopoles with the higher charges |g| = 2g D and |g| = 3g D are the first to date at the LHC and largely surpass those from previous collider experiments (\u223c 400 GeV at the Tevatron). A model-independent result is obtained for monopole production with values of kinetic energy and direction corresponding to the fiducial regions detailed above (see section 4 and figure 8). For monopoles within the fiducial regions, a 95% confidence level upper limit on the cross section of 10 fb is set for monopoles with charges up to 6g D and masses up to 3500 GeV.
