The KS mesons were tagged via registration of KL mesons which crossed the drift chamber without decaying and interacted with the KLOE electromagnetic calorimeter. The KS \u2192 3\u03c0 0 decay was then searched requiring six prompt photons. To suppress background, originating from fake KS tags and KS \u2192 2\u03c0 0 decays with additional two spurious clusters, we have performed a discriminant analysis based on kinematical fit, testing of the signal and background hypotheses and exploiting of the differences in kinematics of the KS decays into 2\u03c0 0 and 3\u03c0 0 . In a sample of about 1.7\u202210 9 \u03c6 \u2192 KSKL events we have found no candidates in data and simulated background samples. Normalizing to the number of KS \u2192 2\u03c0 0 events in the same sample, we have set the upper limit on the KS \u2192 3\u03c0 0 branching ratio BR(KS \u2192 3\u03c0 0 ) < 2.6 \u2022 10 \u22128 at 90% C.L., five times lower than the previous limit. This upper limit can be translated into a limit on the modulus of the \u03b7000 parameter amounting to |\u03b7000| < 0.0088 at 90% C.L., improving by a factor two the latest direct measurement.",

            "text": "Since the first discovery of the CP-violating neutral kaon decay in 1964, there has been made a big effort to describe the CP symmetry breaking within the Standard Model. The favoured theoretical framework was provided in 1973 by Kobayashi and Maskawa, who pointed out that CP violation would follow automatically if there were at least six quark flavours. At present the main experimental effort is focused on the neutral B and D meson system studies. However, there are still several interesting open issuses in the kaon physics, which can contribute to our better understanding of the CP violation mechanism [1]. For example, K S decays to |\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 and |3\u03c0 0 , requiring CP violation, are still poorly known. The |\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 final state can be produced in neutral kaon decays with isospin I = 0, 1, 2, or 3. The I = 0 and I = 2 states have CP = 1, and K S can decay into them without violation of the CP symmetry. However, they are expected to be strongly suppressed by centrifugal barrier effects [2]. For the I = 1 and I = 3 states there is no centrifugal barrier and CP = \u22121, so K S decay requires violation of this symmetry. Anyhow the two kinds of final states can be separated by the analysis of the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 Dalitz plot. This allows for determination of the K S to K L decay amplitude ratio",

The current value of the K S \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 branching ratio amounts to BR(K S \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 ) = ( 3.5 +1.1 \u22120.9 ) \u2022 10 \u22127 [2], and the K S \u2192 3\u03c0 0 has been never observed.

Equal energy positron and electron beams collided at an angle of \u03c0 \u2212 25 mrad producing \u03c6 mesons nearly at rest, which then decayed mainly to K + K \u2212 (49%) and K S K L (34%) final states. The decay products were registered using the KLOE detection setup presented schematically in Fig. 1. The detector consists of a large cylindrical Drift Chamber [7] surrounded by a lead scintillating fiber Electromagnetic Calorimeter [8], both immersed in an axial 0.52 T magnetic field produced by a superconducting solenoid. The beam pipe at the interaction region is a sphere with 10 cm of radius made of a Beryllium-Aluminum alloy of 0.5 mm thickness. The drift chamber, 4 m in diameter and 3.3 m long, has 12582 all stereo drift cells with tungsten sense wires. To minimize the K L regeneration, multiple Coulomb scattering and photon absorption the chamber is constructed out of carbon fiber composite with low-Z and low density, and uses the gas mixture of helium (90%) and isobutane (10%). It provides three-dimensional tracking with resolution in the bending plane about 200 \u00b5m, resolution on the z-coordinate measurement of about 2 mm and of 1 mm on the decay vertex position. Momentum of a particle is determined from the curvature of its trajectory in the magnetic field with a fractional accuracy \u03c3 p /p = 0.4% for polar angles larger than 45 \u2022 [6]. The KLOE electromagnetic calorimeter covers 98% of the solid angle and is composed by a barrel and two endcaps, for a total of 88 modules. Each module is built out of 1 mm scintillating fibers grouped in cells of 4.4x4.4 cm 2 and embedded in 0.5 mm lead foils, and it is read out from both sides by set of photomultipliers. The particle energy deposits are obtained from the photomultipliers signal amplitude, while the arrival times and particles impact points are determined from the spatial coordinates of the fired calorimeter cell and the difference between times measured at both ends of the calorimeter module. The accuracies of energy and time determination are parametrized as \u03c3 E /E = 5.7%/ E (GeV) and \u03c3 t = 57 ps/ E (GeV) \u2295 100 ps, respectively. The trigger [9] uses both calorimeter and chamber information. In the search for the K S \u2192 3\u03c0 0 we have used, however, only the calorimeter information requiring two energy deposits with E > 50 MeV for the barrel and E > 150 MeV for the endcaps.",

            "text": "At KLOE kaons arising from the \u03c6 decay move at low speed with their relative angle close to 180 \u2022 . Therefore, observation of a K L (K S ) decay ensures the presence of a K S (K L ) meson travelling in the opposite direction. About 50% of K L 's reach the calorimeter before decaying, which provides a very clean K S tag by the K L interaction in the calorimeter (K L -crash). It is identified by a cluster with polar angle 40 \u2022 < \u03b8 cr < 140 \u2022 , not associated to any track, with energy E cr > 100 MeV and with a time corresponding to a K L velocity \u03b2 * \u223c 0.2 in the \u03c6 rest frame. The average value of the e + e \u2212 center of mass energy \u221a s is obtained with a precision of 20 keV for each 200 nb \u22121 running period using large angle Bhabha scattering events [6]. The value of \u221a s and the K L -crash cluster position allows us to obtain, for each event, the direction of the K S with an angular resolution of 1 \u2022 and a momentum resolution of about 2 MeV. The search for the K S \u2192 3\u03c0 0 \u2192 6\u03b3 decay is then carried out by the selection of events with six photons which momenta are reconstructed using time and energy measured by the electromagnetic calorimeter. Photons from the K S decay are reconstructed as neutral particles that travel with a velocity \u03b2 = 1 from the interaction point to the KLOE calorimeter (prompt photons). In order to retain a large control sample for the background while preserving high efficiency for the signal, we keep all photons satisfying E \u03b3 > 7 MeV and | cos \u03b8| < 0.915. Each cluster is also required to satisfy the condition |t \u03b3 \u2212 R \u03b3 /c| < min(3.5\u03c3 t , 2 ns), where t \u03b3 is the photon flight time and R the path length. The photon detection efficiency of the calorimeter amounts to about 90% for E \u03b3 = 20 MeV, and reaches 100% above 70 MeV. To determine the K S \u2192 3\u03c0 0 branching ratio we have counted also the K S \u2192 2\u03c0 0 events which are selected requiring 4 prompt photons, and have served as normalization sample. For both channels the expected background as well as the detector acceptance and the analysis efficiency are estimated using the Monte Carlo simulation tool of the experiment [10]. All the processes contributing to the background were simulated with statistics twice larger than the data sample. Moreover, for the acceptance and the analysis efficiency evaluation a dedicated K S \u2192 3\u03c0 0 signal simulation was performed. After K S tagging we have counted 76689 events with six prompt photons. For these events a further discriminant analysis was performed to increase the signal to background ratio. The first analysis step aimed to reject fake K S tags. The distributions of reconstructed K L energy E cr and velocity \u03b2 * for the selected data sample and background simulations are shown in Fig. 2. In the \u03b2 * distribution, the peak around 0.215 corresponds to genuine K L interactions ",

            "text": "In this case one of the low momentum charged pions spirals in the forward direction and interacts in the low-\u03b2 insertion quadrupoles. This interaction produces neutral particles which simulate the signal of K L interaction in the calorimeter (fake K L -crash), while the K L meson decays close enough to the interaction point to produce six prompt photons [5]. To suppress this kind of background we first reject events with charged particles coming from the vicinity of the interaction region. Next, taking advantage of the differences in the \u03b2 * and E cr distributions between the tagged K S events and the fake K Lcrash, we have tightened cuts on these variables: E cr > 150 MeV and 0.20 < \u03b2 * < 0.225. This improves by a factor 12 the rejection of this background with respect to the previous analysis [3]. The second source of background originates from wrongly reconstructed K S \u2192 2\u03c0 0 decays. The four photons from this decay can be reconstructed as six due to fragmentation of the electromagnetic showers (splitting). These events are characterized by one or two lowenergy clusters reconstructed very close to the position of the genuine photon interaction in the calorimeter. Additional clusters can come from the accidental time coincidence between the \u03c6 decay and machine background photons from DA\u03a6NE [5]. In the next stage of the analysis we select only kinematically well defined events. To this end we perform the kinematical fit procedure based on the least squares method imposing energy and momentum conservation, the kaon mass and the velocity of the six photons in the final state. The \u03c7 2 distribution of the fit for data and background simulation, \u03c7 2 f it , is shown in Fig. 3 together with the expected distribution for signal events. Cutting on \u03c7 2 f it considerably reduces the background from bad quality reconstructed events while keeping large signal efficiency [5]. In order to reject events with split and accidental clusters we look at the correlation between two \u03c7 2 -like discriminating variables \u03b6 2\u03c0 and \u03b6 3\u03c0 . \u03b6 2\u03c0 is calculated by an algorithm selecting four out of six clusters best satisfying the kinematic constraints of the two-body decay, therefore it verifies the K S \u2192 2\u03c0 0 \u2192 4\u03b3 hypothesis. The pairing of clusters is based on the requirement m \u03b3\u03b3 = m \u03c0 0 , and on the opening angle of the reconstructed pions trajectories in the K S center of mass frame. Moreover, we check the consistency of the energy and momentum conservation in the \u03c6 \u2192 K S K L , K S \u2192 2\u03c0 0 decay  Figure 4. Distributions of events in the \u03b6 3\u03c0 -\u03b6 2\u03c0 plane, for six-photon sample tagged by K Lcrash for data (left), and for the simulated K S \u2192 3\u03c0 0 decays (right). The solid lines show the signal region definition chosen using the optimization procedure described in the text.",

For K S \u2192 2\u03c0 0 decays plus two background clusters, we expect \u2206E \u223c 0, while for K S \u2192 3\u03c0 0 \u2206E \u223c m \u03c0 0 /\u03c3 E .

Distributions of these two discriminant variables are presented in Fig. 5. Before counting of the K S \u2192 3\u03c0 0 candidate events, we have optimized the event selection in order to reduce the background as strongly as possible while keeping high signal efficiency. Cuts on the discriminant variables have been refined minimizing f cut (\u03c7 2 f it , \u03b6 2\u03c0 , \u03b6 3\u03c0 , \u2206E, R min ) = N up /\u01eb 3\u03c0 , where \u01eb 3\u03c0 stands for the signal selection efficiency and N up is the mean upper limit (at 90% C.L.) on the expected f it , \u03b6 2\u03c0 , \u03b6 3\u03c0 , \u2206E, R min ) from simulation [1]. As the result of the optimization we have obtained the following values for cuts on discriminant variables: \u03c7 2 f it < 57.2, \u2206E > 1.88 and R min > 65 cm. The signal box is defined as: 4 < \u03b6 2\u03c0 < 84.9 and \u03b6 3\u03c0 < 5.2 [5]. Since the expected number of background events was estimated using the Monte Carlo simulations, we have checked at each stage of the analysis how well the simulation describes the experimental data. Distributions of \u03c7 2 f it , \u2206E and R min variables are presented in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7 for events in the signal box. In the right panel of Fig. 7 we present also the R min distribution just before the last cut R min > 65 cm marked with a black arrow. One can see a good agreement between simulations and measured data at every stage of the analysis. At the end of the analysis we have found zero candidates in data and in the simulated background sample. As it was mentioned, the K S \u2192 2\u03c0 0 normalization sample is selected requiring four prompt photons. The Monte Carlo simulation shows a negligible (0.1%) amount of \u03c6 \u2192 K + K \u2212 background events, thus no further discriminant analysis was required. In the same tagged sample of K S mesons we have found N 2\u03c0 = (7.533 \u00b1 0.018) \u2022 10 7 events. Using simulations we have also determined the K S \u2192 2\u03c0 0 \u2192 4\u03b3 selection efficiency: \u01eb 2\u03c0 = 0.660 \u00b1 0.002 stat .

However, the search for the K S \u2192 3\u03c0 0 decay will be continued by the KLOE-2 collaboration, which is continuing and extending the physics program of its predecessor [11]. For the forthcoming run the KLOE performance have been improved by adding new subdetector systems: the tagger system for the \u03b3\u03b3 physics, the Inner Tracker based on the Cylindrical GEM technology and two calorimeters in the final focusing region [12]. These new calorimeters will increase the acceptance of the detector, while the new inner detector for the determination of the K S vertex will significantly reduce the contribution of the background processes involving charged particles. Increasing the statistics and acceptance of the detector while significantly reducing the background gives a realistic chance to observe the K S \u2192 3\u03c0 0 decay for the first time in the near future.",
