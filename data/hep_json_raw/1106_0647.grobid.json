The elementary processes that contribute in the final state are qq \u2192 qq, qg \u2192 qg, gg \u2192 gg, and gg \u2192 qq, where q and g are quarks (or antiquarks) and gluons, respectively. Each of the final state particles may subsequently lose energy by emitting other quarks and gluons in a process referred to as a parton shower (PS). Finally, the products of the parton shower undergo hadronisation and form hadron jets. Events with three or more jets in the final state originate from hard-gluon radiation and other higher-order QCD processes.

This definition provides a general estimate of the energy available to the parton-parton hard process and is less sensitive to detector effects than p T . Major systematic uncertainties that hamper jet cross section measurements, such as those due to the jet energy scale and the jet selection efficiency, largely cancel in the measurement of R 32 , whilst the uncertainty on the integrated luminosity measurement cancels completely. Hence, a measurement of R 32 is subject to smaller uncertainties than the absolute multijet cross section measurements and can provide a stringent test of the theoretical models.",

Such studies are important because QCD-induced processes constitute, in some cases, the dominant backgrounds for signals of new physics at the LHC.

The measured ratio rises with increasing H T , as the phase space opens for the production of a third jet, reaching a plateau value of about 0.8 for H T 1 TeV.",

Alpgen, which also uses this method, describes well the data for H T > 0.5 TeV, but overestimates R 32 for lower H T values. The difference between the predictions of MadGraph and Alpgen is an estimate of the uncertainty of the theoretical predictions due to the different jet-parton matching parameters used by the two MC programs. The current results combined with previous measurements of event shapes and dijet angular decorrelations indicate that whilst MadGraph has difficulties in describing the details of the event shapes and dijet angular decorrelations, it predicts correctly the probability of emitting a third parton in the final state. The MC programs that use LO matrix elements to simulate the hard scattering and PS for all higher-order effects (Pythia6, Pythia8, Herwig++) describe well the data above H T > 0.5 TeV, but overestimate R 32 below this value. This is the first measurement of this ratio in the multi-TeV region, extending to an H T range that has not been explored before. ",
