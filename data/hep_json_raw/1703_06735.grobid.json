In the presence of a conjectural mirror magnetic field of unknown magnitude and direction, the resonance transformation conditions can be found by scanning the magnitude of the ordinary magnetic field in the range e.g. \u00b1100\u00b5T. Magnetic field is assumed to be uniform along the path of neutron beam. If the transformation effect exists within this range, the direction and possible time variation of the mirror magnetic field can be determined with additional dedicated measurements.",

Many different theoretical models of Dark Matter [1,2] suffer from a lack of direct experimental measurements that could reveal the nature of DM in interactions other than gravitational. Several direct Dark Matter search experiments [2] have created a rather controversial situation, from one side excluding Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) in the range of masses 6 GeV with the weak coupling strength to the target particles of Ordinary Matter (OM), and from another side claiming signals of Dark Matter detection in a lower mass range than expected by the popular supersymmetric models [3]. On the other hand, experiments at the Large Hadron Collider so far have not been able to find WIMP particles that could be candidates for a single-component DM [2]. The general difficulty in identifying the nature of Dark Matter is the lack of non-controversial and reproducible effects of non-gravitational interactions between the DM and OM particles.",

            "text": "In this paper we will discuss a new, simple particle physics experiment with neutrons that could test one of the DM models of specific interest. In this model, DM (in whole or at least in some fraction) consists of Mirror Matter (MM) from a hidden gauge sector that represents an exact copy of the ordinary particle sector. The concept of mirror fermions was introduced in 1956 as a way to restore parity in a seminal paper by Lee and Yang, while in 1966 Kobzarev, Okun and Pomeranchuk showed that mirror fermions cannot have common strong, weak and electromagnetic interactions with ordinary fermions and thus the former can exist in the form of an independent parallel sector which they coined as the mirror world [4]. From todays' view, once ordinary matter and its interactions are described by the Standard Model (SM), then the mirror particle content and interactions are described by another copy of (SM ). It can be equivalently viewed, in the context of extra dimensions, as OM and MM are localized on two parallel branes with corresponding SM and SM selfinteractions, while the gravity propagating through the bulk interacts with both types of matter. Thus, MM and OM interact gravitationally, providing observable manifestations of DM effects, but they have no common SM and SM interactions; in fact, renormalizable interaction terms between particles of two sectors are forbidden by the particle content of the Standard Model, in the same way as renormalizable interactions violating baryon or lepton numbers. However, in difference from cold dark matter candidates, MM is self-interacting and dissipative matter in the same sense as OM. Once MM is adopted as a framework for DM, then the properties of MM with respect to particle content and interactions are well known by the model requirement of SM \u2261 SM . On the other hand, the cosmological genesis and galactic evolution might be different between MM and OM due to differences in abundance and temperature of the two sectors and the obvious lack of observational details of the mirror sector. Many aspects of the MM cosmology were discussed and addressed in the literature [5]. Although these aspects are not broadly assimilated, the mirror matter hypothesis remains a viable option for DM. A detailed discussion of the viability of the MM model is not in the scope of this paper. The interested reader can learn these ideas e.g. from reviews [6].",

            "text": "Important for this paper are two aspects of MM. First, it was conjectured that the neutral particles of the OM and MM sectors, elementary like neutrinos or composite like neutrons, can be mixed, providing an interaction portal between the two sectors. Namely, the kinetic mixing of ordinary and mirror photons, first discussed in [7], which makes mirror matter effectively mini-charged with respect to the ordinary electromagnetic forces. Though the kinetic mixing is severely restricted by cosmological limits [8], it can lead to experimentally observable effects, such as positronium oscillation into mirror positronium [9], and can also provide an interesting portal for the direct detection of mirror dark matter consisting dominantly of mirror helium and hydrogen and a smaller fraction of heavier mirror nuclei like carbon, oxygen etc. [10]. In addition, ordinary and mirror particles can also share some hypothetical forces, interacting e.g. with gauge bosons of common family symmetry [11] or common B \u2212 L symmetry [12]. The lepton and baryon number violating interactions between OM and MM are of specific interest since they could lead to the co-genesis of baryon asymmetries in both sectors and shed the light on the near coincidence of the baryon and dark matter fractions in the Universe [13]. Such interactions, at low energies, would induce lepton or baryon number violating effects such as the ordinary (active) neutrino oscillations into mirror (sterile) neutrinos [14] and neutron oscillations into mirror neutrons [15], resembling and perhaps related to the more familiar but still not observed phenomenon of neutron-antineutron oscillation [16].",

The reason why such a fast oscillation (in fact, faster than the neutron decay), which leads to the violation of baryon (neutron) number could be unnoticed in experiments is the presence of the Earth magnetic field, which was never compensated for in the experiments measuring the neutron lifetime. In fact, in the absence of matter and with a compensated magnetic field half of the free neutrons created in experiments would have to disappear within seconds.",

This is a second aspect of MM that is important for this paper. In particular, the photon -mirror photon kinetic mixing [7] could induce large galactic magnetic fields, both ordinary and mirror, via the electron drag mechanism [18]. On the other hand, the same interaction portal could lead to the accumulation of some small amount of mirror matter in the Earth, which could be sufficient for the induction of a mirror magnetic field up to few Gauss via the mirror electron drag due to rotation of the Earth, the mechanism discussed in Ref. [18]. In this way, the mirror magnetic field at the Earth might have a magnitude of the same order as the Earth's own magnetic field. In addition, its orientation relative to ordinary magnetic field can be arbitrary and might also be variable in time [17].",

These experiments were performed with Ultra-Cold Neutrons (UCN), where the effect of n \u2192 n transformation could lead to the unaccounted disappearance of the neutrons stored in the UCN trap. In the presence of Earth magnetic field B, the neutron with its magnetic moment \u00b5 will change its energy level by \u00b5B, while the mirror neutron will not interact with ordinary magnetic field B. Thus, the Zeeman split of the energy levels would suppress the n \u2192 n transformation. The first experiments were thought to require shielding of the Earth's magnetic field, due to their assumption that no mirror magnetic field could exist at the Earth. In this way, under the hypothesis that the mirror magnetic field at the Earth is vanishing, the limit \u03c4 > 414 s was obtained at 90 % C.L. [21,1].",

Additionally, in this re-analysis some data runs corresponding to unstable reactor flux conditions, as indicated by the system of two monitoring counters, were excluded. The neutron storage time in the trap was measured multiple times with variation of the laboratory magnetic field that was regularly alternated in the vertical direction with magnitude \u00b120\u00b5T . From these data the asymmetry parameter from up and down variation of the direction of the magnetic field was calculated and the result has shown a peculiar anomaly with statistical 5\u03c3 deviation from the expected zero asymmetry for non-polarized neutrons in the Be-coated trap. In the absence of consistent alternative interpretations, the asymmetry could be explained as an effect of the variation of the angle between B and unknown B resulting in a different degree of suppression of the n \u2192 n transformation probability. The model [24] would describe the observed asymmetry by the following parameters: an oscillation time on the order of 10 s and the magnitude of the mirror magnetic field \u223c 10 \u00b5T. These parameters, however, should be considered as rather approximate for several reasons. First, the angle between B and B remains unknown; and second, the effect of possible non-uniformity of magnetic field B was not taken into account.",

Both can be combined in one experimental layout using a neutron beam from a cold cryogenic moderator. The first method is the observation of a disappearance effect of the neutrons flying in vacuum through the path of length L 1 in a controlled magnetic field B. This uniform magnetic field should be varied by steps systematically in order to find the resonance condition where the probability of neutron disappearance due to n \u2192 n transformations will be maximal. Beam neutrons will not interact with the chamber walls except at the entrance and exit of the vacuum volume. At the end of L 1 flight distance the cold neutron beam will be stopped in a 3 He gaseous detector that will be thick enough to absorb > 99% of slow sub-thermal neutrons and to accurately measure beam intensity for the detection of the disappearance effect. The disappearance effect of the order of \u223c 10 \u22127 should be expected in the resonance peak for an oscillation time of \u03c4 = 20 s. Produced mirror neutrons will not interact with this absorption detector and will propagate free through the large-thickness beam dump wall behind the detector.",

The SNS produces neutrons via the bombardment of high-energy protons into a heavy metal (liquid mercury) target. The proton beam is pulsed at 60Hz, allowing for exploitation of the time structure to resolve thermal neutron energies to \u00b5eV resolution. While this latter capability is useful for many neutron scattering applications at SNS, a n \u2192 n search experiment would not immediately benefit from this time structure. The proposed detector distances ensure that there is always neutron intensity available across the entire time period between pulses.

With a gaseous 3 He monitoring counter, it will be possible to vary the efficiency by changing the partial pressure of the 3 He in gas. The cross section of the detection reaction n + 3 He \u2192 1 H + 3 H depends on the neutron velocity as 1/v. Therefore, the large efficiency of the monitoring counter will lead to the absorption of the slowest neutrons that contribute more significantly to the sensitivity of the disappearance and even more so to the regeneration of neutrons. Spectrum efficiency can be calculated and the ratio I B (t)/I A (t) can be optimized in terms of the statistical monitoring error. As was found in our calculations for the SNS spectrum, the optimum can be achieved at the efficiency of \u223c 30%.

We assume that switching between different values of magnetic field will take a short amount of time as compared to the time T M of measurement with either field. Thus, such alternation can have frequency as high as 1 Hz. For zero magnetic field B, the existing limit for n \u2192 n disappearance oscillation time was set in UCN experiments as \u03c4 > 414s [21,1]. Thus, the zero value of magnetic field can be used as established no-effect point. For time-sharing monitoring the sharing efficiency of 50% will be optimal, however at the same time, the rate of regeneration measurement will be reduced by a factor of 2. This scheme can work for the disappearance measurement if the characteristic instability time of the neutron source is essentially larger than T M . This might be more appropriate for the cold beams at the reactors rather than at pulsed spallation sources.

A solenoidal coil can control the magnetic field along the tube axis and two orthogonal \"cos(\u03b8)\" coils with wires running along the tube length and with cosine distribution of current on the cylindrical surface can be used to set two uniform dipole components of the field in transversal direction. The cos(\u03b8) coils are compact and can be built together with solenoidal coil as concentric cylinders outside the vacuum tube made of thin isolated sheets carrying the current wires. These coils will compensate the local, uniform Earth magnetic field and create a controlled 3-D magnetic field inside the flight tube. If the local, environmental magnetic field will be non-uniform, additional coils can be installed to compensate for these local effects. Alternatively, an outer layer of \u00b5-metal shielding can be installed around the field-shaping coils to reduce the effects of most external field sources. Using active feedback of the currents in respect to the reference calibrated magnetic field sensors, we assume that the magnetic field can be controlled in any direction with magnitude from 0 to 100 \u00b5T with uniformity better than 0.2 \u00b5T. The design and control of the magnetic field will likely be the most technically challenging but feasible problem in the considered experiment. A similar kind of problem for shaping uniform magnetic fields with cos(\u03b8) coils was considered and prototyped in the paper [34] for measurement of the neutron electric dipole moment. In a disappearance/regeneration experiment, the effects of the local magnetic field non-uniformity and fluctuations can result in some deviation from the quasi-free condition as it was shown in Ref.

Let us assume that a measurement with a value of magnetic field B will last for time T that can be e.g. 3600 seconds (1 hour). By integrating the velocity spectrum S(v), we can define the total initial beam rate R 0 or the intensity; see eq. (5). To compensate for the possible time variation of the beam intensity, the counting rate of the absorption counter (B) R B that is measuring the disappearance effect will be divided by the rate R A of the monitoring counter (A) that has efficiency . Average detection rates in (A) are: R A = \u2022 R 0 and R A + R B = R 0 . Since the absorption cross section in 3 He counter is proportional to 1/v, the monitoring counter (A) will deplete the spectrum of neutrons with low velocities and the probability of disappearance in eq.

This function for given the velocity spectrum was calculated by direct spectrum integration and approximated as (1 \u2212 1.7 + 0.76 2 ).

Since both peaks are generated by the same effect of neutron disappearance, in the analysis of peak significance, or the absence thereof, for determination of the exclusion upper limit for oscillation time \u03c4 it is useful to fold two parts of the scan with positive and negative directions of magnetic field B. In this case the folded resonance peak will not depend on the angle \u03b2 and significance of the peak (or exclusion limit) can be determined in terms of the oscillation time \u03c4 only. On another count, the different relative height of two peaks, as in Figure 3, would provide measurement of the angle \u03b2. As an example, the angle \u03b2 is assumed in Figure 3 to be equal to 3/4\u03c0 relative to the vertical up direction. Thus, in the measurement of disappearance both parameters \u03c4 and \u03b2 of equations (1)-(2) can be separately determined.

For regeneration measurements we defined the \"search window\" as 13 consequent measurements separated by step of 0.2\u00b5T. For these measurements, high efficiency of the monitoring counter (A) is not required and would even significantly impair the transformation probability. Therefore, for regeneration we assume low efficiency (< 1%) of the counter (A) that will not essentially deplete the low-velocity part of the spectrum. However, the counting rate of the counter (A) still will be much higher than any possible rate of the regeneration counter (C). Therefore, monitoring of the beam intensity will not contribute significantly in the statistical error of regeneration measurement. Most essential for observation of a regeneration effect in the 3 He counter (C) will be the background due to detection of thermal neutrons. We assume that this irreducible background rate will be n bkgr = 0.1 cps which is achievable for a high-efficiency counter of the size 50 \u00d7 50 cm 2 .

Both cold neutron beam disappearance and regeneration methods, as described above, will be free of the uncertainties of UCN interactions with material walls. Requirement of monitoring of the intensity of cold neutron beam makes optimization of sensitivity for disappearance and regeneration operation modes different, such that for optimal performance these two measurements should be performed as two separate experiments with different efficiency of the monitoring counter. From Tables 1 and 2 we can see that with minimal anticipated measurement time per scan point as T = 1 hour each of these two experiments will require \u223c 10 days of beam time. Since the increase of the flight path length can linearly increase the limit of oscillation time \u03c4 it will be advantageous for the disappearance stage of the experiment to increase the total length of the disappearance path to 2L 1 , or in our example to 30-m. Then, with the SNS example cold neutron beam, monitoring efficiency 30%, and for 10 days run time in disappearance mode, the limit of \u03c4 > 28 s can be reached. For the regeneration measurement, two flight paths separated by the absorber will be needed and to reach the same level of sensitivity as in the disappearance measurement the overall increase of the experiment length will be required. Increase of the flight path length will make the width of resonance narrower and might increase the requirements for the uniformity of magnetic field. Ultimately, the increase of sensitivity with the length will be counteracted by the gravity effect depleting the low-velocity part of the neutron spectrum. We would like to stress that disappearance and regeneration are two different physics processes; in this paper we discuss them in the context of the theoretical mirror matter model where they have common origin, but these two processes should be studied independently.",

Due to the simplicity of the concept of the experiment, fast feedback from measurements can be available on-line. This will allow, in the case of observation of an anomaly in the counting rates, for the experiment configuration to return to any particular magnetic field setting and re-run this point for a reproducibility check.",

Positive detection of a new effect with the oscillation time \u03c4 in the range 10-30 s will facilitate, along side additional experimental efforts, other interesting measurements possibilites. Thus, the vector direction of B mirror magnetic field can be determined, which would confirm the existence of an electromagnetic component for mirror matter. A disappearance and regeneration experiment with magnetic field B coinciding in the direction with B will allow detection of the neutron transformation effect with its maximum unsuppressed magnitude. Since the measurement of a single field configuration with B takes a short time on the order of 1 hour, the stability of magnitude and direction of the mirror magnetic field B can be explored giving the insight on the cosmological or terrestrial origin of B . At the resonance condition, the beam of mirror neutrons as massive sterile particles penetrating the absorption wall will be formed behind the wall, thus, allowing the study of possible interactions of MM with OM.",

The described experiment can be performed at several neutron sources where cold neutron beams of high intensity are available. Neutron sources with colder neutron spectra, with higher beam intensities, or where beam line design can be improved by the focusing of cold neutrons with corresponding increase of the length of the experiment potentially can provide larger sensitivities. In particular, the European Spallation Source (ESS) that is under construction at Lund [37] with the Large Beam Port envisaged in the project for the neutron-antineutron search experiment, can provide sensitivity for an oscillation time of more than 50 seconds. This is due to higher intensity and flight times that can be accomodated at that facility. In this way, if the n \u2212 n oscillation time happens to be around 10 seconds, the ESS in fact could become a factory of mirror neutrons.",
