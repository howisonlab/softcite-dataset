The primary reaction is the fusion of two protons into a deuteron, a positron and a neutrino. These neutrinos constitute the vast majority of neutrinos reaching Earth, providing us with key information about what goes on at the core of our star. Several experiments have now confirmed the observation of neutrino oscillations by detecting neutrinos from secondary nuclear processes in the Sun; this is the first direct spectral measurement of the neutrinos from the keystone proton-proton fusion. This observation is a crucial step towards the completion of the spectroscopy of pp-chain neutrinos, as well as further validation of the LMA-MSW model of neutrino oscillations.",

There are two main ways of converting protons to He nuclei that take place in stars: the pp chain and the CNO cycle [2]. The contribution from each of these processes depends on the size, temperature and age of the star [1]. The main way of producing energy in the Sun and in stars of similar mass and age is the pp chain [3]. Fig. 1 shows the main reactions that are responsible for it. The different neutrinos in the chain are often referred to by their parent particles. We thus speak of pp neutrinos as those produced in the top left of the chain, whose parents are simply two protons. Though most of the energy and neutrino flux in the Sun comes from the pp chain, more massive and hotter stars produce much more significant amounts of energy through the CNO cycle [1]. In addition, a small component of the Sun's neutrino flux also comes from the CNO cycle.",

Real triggered events with no cuts are artificially overlapped with random data obtained from the ends of real trigger windows, uncorrelated with the triggering event. By overlapping four random data samples with each physical trigger, we obtain a sample of synthetic events that has four times the exposure of the real data set used. The synthetic events are then reconstructed using the same software used for real events, and selected with the same criteria. Using this method, we obtained the true rate and spectral shape of pile-up in our detector. This method naturally accounts for the effect of fiducialization on pile-up events.",
