Since the discovery of D mesons in 1976, the hadronic decays of D mesons have been extensively investigated [1]. However, the existing measurements of the D hadronic decays containing at least two K 0 S mesons in the final state are still very poor due to limited statistics [1].",

These decays have simpler event topologies and suffer less from combinatorial backgrounds than other decay modes containing two K 0 S in the final state. The comprehensive or improved measurements of three-body decays will benefit the understanding of the interplay between the weak and strong interactions in multibody decays where theoretical pre-dictions are poorer than two-body decays. The improved measurements of two-body decays can serve to better explore the contributions of W-exchange diagrams and final-state interactions [2][3][4][5], as well as SU(3)-flavor symmetry breaking effects [6][7][8][9][10] in D meson decays. In addition, these measurements will also help to improve background estimations in the precision measurements of D and B meson decays.",

To optimize the precision for these measurements, we use a single-tag method, in which either a D or D is reconstructed in an event. We combine the yields measured with previously reported values of the cross sections for e + e \u2212 \u2192 D 0D0 and D + D \u2212 at the \u03c8(3770) resonance peak [18].",

            "text": "The BESIII detector is a magnetic spectrometer that operates at the BEPCII collider. It has a cylindrical geometry with a solid-angle coverage of 93% of 4\u03c0 . It consists of several main components. A 43-layer main drift chamber (MDC) surrounding the beam pipe performs precise determinations of charged particle trajectories and measures the specific ionization (dE/dx) for charged particle identification (PID). An array of time-of-flight counters (TOF) is located outside the MDC and provides additional PID information. A CsI(Tl) electromagnetic calorimeter (EMC) surrounds the TOF and is used to measure the energies of photons and electrons. A solenoidal superconducting magnet outside the EMC provides a 1 T magnetic field in the central tracking region of the detector.  The iron flux return of the magnet is instrumented with 1272 m 2 of resistive plate muon counters (MUC) arranged in nine layers in the barrel and eight layers in the endcaps for identification of muons with momentum greater than 0.5 GeV/c. More details about the BESIII detector are described in Ref. [12]. A GEANT4-based [19] Monte Carlo (MC) simulation software package, which includes the geometric description and response of the detector, is used to determine the detection efficiency and to estimate background for each decay mode. An inclusive MC sample, which includes the D 0D0 , D + D \u2212 and non-DD decays of the \u03c8(3770), initial-state-radiation (ISR) production of the \u03c8(3686) and J /\u03c8 , the e + e \u2212 \u2192 qq (q = u, d, s) continuum process, the Bhabha scattering events, the di-muon events and the di-tau events, is produced at \u221a s = 3.773 GeV. The equivalent luminosity of the MC sample is ten times of data. The \u03c8(3770) decays are generated by the MC generator KKMC [20], which incorporates both ISR effects [21] and final-state-radiation (FSR) effects [22]. Known decay modes are generated using EvtGen [23] with input branching fractions from the Particle Data Group (PDG) [1]. Unmeasured decays are generated using LundCharm [24].",

The difference of momentum weighted efficiencies between data and MC of the tracking [PID] are determined to be (+2.1 \u00b1 0.4)% [(\u22120.3 \u00b1 0.1)%] for the K + in the D + \u2192 PID] for the K + and \u03c0 + , respectively. In order to estimate the systematic uncertainty associated with the M BC fit, we repeat the measurements by varying the fit range ((1.8415, 1.8865) GeV/c 2 ), signal shape (with different MC matching requirements) and endpoint of the ARGUS function (\u00b10.2 MeV/c 2 ). Quadratically summing the changes of the branching fractions yields 2.1%, 1.0%, 4.2% and 2.7% for D +",
