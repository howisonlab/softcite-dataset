            "text": "The muon magnetic anomaly, a \u00b5 = (g\u22122) \u00b5 /2, endures as an long-standing test of the Standard Model (SM), where the \u223c 3.5\u03c3 (or higher) discrepancy between the experimental measurement a exp \u00b5 and the SM prediction a SM \u00b5 could be an indication of the existence of new physics beyond the SM. For a SM \u00b5 , work is ongoing to improve the estimates from all sectors of the SM, where in particular the hadronic contributions limit the total precision. Currently, the efforts of the Muon g \u2212 2 Theory Initiative [1] and the groups involved within it show great progress and promise in improving the estimate of a SM \u00b5 and its uncertainty. A recent precise re-evaluation of the dominating hadronic vacuum polarisation contributions to a SM \u00b5 has resulted in a SM \u00b5 = (11 659 182.04 \u00b1 3.56) \u00d7 10 \u221210 [2] (for alternative evaluations of a SM \u00b5 , see other analyses as part of [1]). Comparing this with the current experimental world average value of a exp \u00b5 = (11 659 209.1\u00b15.4 stat \u00b13.3 sys )\u00d710 \u221210 [3] results in a deviation between theory and experiment of \u2206a \u00b5 = (27.06 \u00b1 7.26) \u00d7 10 \u221210 , corresponding to a 3.7\u03c3 discrepancy [2]. The value for a exp \u00b5 is entirely dominated by the measurements made at the Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) [4], which achieved an overall precision of 540 parts-per-billion (ppb). However, efforts are currently underway to improve the experimental estimate at the Muon g \u2212 2 experiment at Fermilab (E989) [5] and also at the proposed future J-PARC experiment [6].",

An 8 GeV proton beam is fired at a target to produce pions. These pions are then injected into a delivery ring, in which the pions decay into muons via \u03c0 + \u2192 \u00b5 + \u03bd \u00b5 . A long decay channel for the pion decay into muons is provided by \u223c 4 orbits of the delivery ring. During this time, any remaining protons and the resulting muons are separated by enough orbital distance that the protons can be safely discarded from the beam. The result is a \u223c 96% longitudinally-polarised \u00b5 + beam consisting of 8 \u00d7 10 6 muons/sec with an energy of 3.094 GeV/c and a \u03c0 + content of < 10 \u22125 %. Not only does this allow for 21 times more decay positrons to be detected than at BNL, but the minimal proton and pion contamination also reduces the hadronic flash recorded by the detectors at beam injection by a factor of 20 compared to the previous experiment. The BNL storage ring has been recommissioned for the Fermilab experiment. In 2013, it was transported 3,200 miles on a high-profile 35-day journey that received great interest from the wider physics community and the general public. To safely the deliver the muons to the experiment from the upstream beam-line, the beam is injected into the storage ring through a superconducting inflector magnet, which locally cancels the \u223c 1.45 T storage B-field to allow the muons to enter without being deflected.",

There are several subtle variations and/or analyser choices possible when attempting this fitting procedure, resulting in many different analysis groups analysing the same data via alternate methods, each providing a consistency check of the others. Due to the storage environment, the five-parameter function in equation 4is not sufficient in describing all the relevant beam dynamics that contribute to the oscillation in the data rate that is detected. For example, the injection of the muon beam at a radial offset and an imperfect kick lead to coherent betatron oscillations (CBO) of the beam in the radial direction. The calorimeters are sensitive to this and other similar systematic effects. Therefore, extra terms are necessarily added to equation (4) to describe the additional beam dynamics and corresponding systematic uncertainties are evaluated. Other detector systems are also utilised that are invaluable in this regard. Two straw tracker stations, for example, measure the spatial profile of the stored muons, which help to determine the values of the two corrections (the E-field and pitch corrections) in equation 3, monitor the beam oscillations and measure the muon distribution to convolute with the magnetic field measurement. Additionally, a state-of-the-art laser calibration system has been developed that monitors and provides calorimeter gain stability to sub-per-mil accuracy [8].",

The analysable data after data quality cuts (DQC) is 1.38 times that of the BNL dataset, with a projected statistical uncertainty of 350 ppb. Figure 4a shows the accumulation of data over the course of Run-1. Figure 4b shows the fit-to-data of 0.95 billion positrons accumulated over 60 hours in mid-April 2018, corresponding to a statistical uncertainty of 1.3 ppm. The publication of the result from all data from Run-1 is expected in late-2019. Studies of the performance during Run-1 showed that the muon storage was roughly half that of the original design specifications. This was, in-part, due to an underperformance of the kicker system, which was found to have a 30% deficit in required kick strength. Therefore, the summer shutdown that directly followed the end of Run-1 involved a substantial kicker system upgrade. Additional upgrades were performed to the electrostatic quadrupoles and the accelerator complex. The installation of a new open-ended inflector magnet has been planned for the end of Run-2 in the summer of 2019, which is projected to incur a further \u223c 40% increase in the number of stored muons. Currently, the Muon g \u2212 2 experiment is due to continue running for a further two years to obtain the full 20\u00d7 BNL statistics dataset.  ",

The first physics run and a summer programme of essential upgrades are already complete. During Run-1 alone, the experiment collected twice the number of positrons collected at the BNL experiment, which after DQC should yield a statistical uncertainty of 350 ppb.
