            "text": "A recently discovered fundamental particle has properties that are consistent with the standard model (SM) predictions for the Higgs boson, H [1][2][3][4]. In the SM, flavor-changing neutral currents (FCNC) are forbidden at tree level and are strongly suppressed in loop corrections by the Glashow-Iliopoulos-Maiani (GIM) mechanism [5] with the SM branching fraction of t \u2192 qH predicted to be O(10 \u221215 ) [6][7][8]. Several extensions of the SM incorporate significantly enhanced FCNC behavior that can be directly probed at the CERN LHC [8,9]. The FCNC processes that correspond to tH interactions are described by the following effective Lagrangian: 1) where g is the weak coupling constant, P L and P R are chirality projectors in spin space, \u03ba Hqt is the effective coupling, f L Hq and f R Hq are left-and right-handed complex chiral parameters with a unitarity constraint of |f L Hq | 2 + |f R Hq | 2 = 1. The tH FCNC interaction is studied in this analysis in two channels: the associated production of a single top quark with the Higgs boson (ST), as well as in FCNC decays of top quarks in tt semileptonic events (TT). In this analysis, H \u2192 bb decays are considered. This is the first time that the analysis of the ST mode is presented. Representative Feynman diagrams of the studied processes are shown in figure 1.",

Up to two additional partons are simulated by the Monte Carlo (MC) generator in the initial hard process for the top quark pair production mode. The MLM [18] matching scheme is used to match additional partons in the matrix-element calculations to the parton-shower description. No additional partons are included in the generation of events for the single top quark production process, as such inclusion would contain contributions from the top quark pair production process. A systematic variation in the normalization of the single top production process by 10% is considered in order to account for the differences in the generation of additional radiation of the two signal production modes. The Lagrangian terms from eq. (1.1) are implemented by means of the FeynRules package [19] using the universal FeynRules output format [20]. The complex chiral parameters are fixed to f R Hq = 1 and f L Hq = 0. The SM top quark pair production is the dominant background process and is simulated to next-to-leading order (NLO) using powheg v2 [21][22][23][24].

The reconstruction is performed for all possible permutations of the b-tagged jets to be associated with the decay products of the Higgs boson or the top quark, and both solutions for the longitudinal momentum of the neutrino are considered. The reconstructed kinematic variables for each permutation are then fed into a multivariate analysis that uses a boosted decision tree (BDT) [40] approach, as implemented in the toolkit for multivariate analysis TMVA [41].

The resultant limits on the coupling strengths are \u03ba Hut < 0.18 (0.16) and \u03ba Hct < 0.18 (0.18). These limits are very competitive to the CMS result with the combination of various channels at 8 TeV [12], while the ATLAS result with the analysis of the H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 decay at 13 TeV [11] represents the best limits to date. The measured one-dimensional exclusion limits are also interpreted for the scenario of the non-vanishing FCNC couplings via a linear interpolation. The results for two-dimensional limits on top quark FCNC decay branching fractions and coupling strengths are presented in figure 6 and 7, respectively. We define a signal strength parameter as \u00b5 = \u03c3/\u03c3 sig , where \u03c3 is the cross section excluded at 95% CL and \u03c3 sig is the predicted cross section for signal. A maximum likelihood fit is performed for the signal strength, and is shown in figure 8. Inclusion of the associated production of a single top quark with a Higgs boson in this study provides a \u224820% relative improvement in the expected upper limit on B(t \u2192 uH) with respect to the results obtained in an analysis of only tt events with top quark FCNC decays.",

This is the first search to probe tH flavor-changing neutral current couplings in both associated production of a top quark with the Higgs boson and in top quark decays. Observed (expected) upper limits at 95% confidence level are set on the branching fractions of top quark decays, B(t \u2192 uH) < 0.47% (0.34%) and B(t \u2192 cH) < 0.47% (0.44%). These results provide a significant improvement over the previous limits set by CMS in the H \u2192 bb channel, as well as represent the best limits for B(t \u2192 uH) at CMS.",
