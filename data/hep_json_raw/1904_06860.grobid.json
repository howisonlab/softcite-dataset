This limit excludes QCD axions heavier than 0.59 eV/c 2 in the DFSZ model and 168.1 eV/c 2 in the KSVZ model.",

The crystals are immersed in 2,200 L of linear alkyl benzene (LAB)-based liquid scintillator (LS), which acts as a veto for multiple hit events [22]. Shielding structures of copper, lead, and plastic scintillator surround the liquid scintillator to reduce the background contribution from external radiation and to veto cosmic-rays [11,23] as shown in Fig. 2. Data from the two-month period between 20 October 2016 and 19 December 2016 are used in this analysis. This period was very stable with no environmental abnormality.",

Therefore, the solar axion search dataset requires: a signal in one crystal and no signal in any other crystals, the liquid scintillator or the muon detector. Events with hits in other crystals or the liquid scintillator are selected as multiple-hit events and used for the development of event selection criteria, energy calibration, efficiency determination and background assessment as described in Refs. [12,24,25]. Multivariate machine learning algorithms, Boosted Decision Trees (BDTs) [26], are trained to discriminate PMT-induced noise events from radiation induced scintillation events. Multiple-hit events produced by Compton scattering of \u03b3-rays from a 60 Co calibration source, weighted to match the energy spectrum of the expected background, were used as a scintillation signal sample. Single-hit data were used as a training sample containing both the scintillation signals and PMT noise. A description of the variables used for the training is given in Ref. [27].",

Here we apply the recent prediction for the solar axion flux that assumes that axions produce electron recoil signals in the NaI(Tl) detector through the axio-electric effects. There is no excess of events that could be attributed to solar axion interactions and we determined a 90% CL limit of the axion-electron coupling, g ae < 1.70 \u00d7 10 \u221211 for m a = 0 keV to 1 keV. This excludes QCD axions heavier than 0.59 eV/c 2 in the DFSZ model and 168.1 eV/c 2 in the KSVZ model.",
