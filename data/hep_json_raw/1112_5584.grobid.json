The data were collected by the HERMES experiment at the HERA storage ring at DESY while studying inclusive deep-inelastic scattering of 27.6 GeV longitudinally polarized leptons off a transversely polarized hydrogen gas target. The results are consistent with previous experimental data from CERN and SLAC. For the x-range covered, the measured integral of g 2 (x) converges to the null result of the Burkhardt-Cottingham sum rule. The x 2 moment of the twist-3 contribution to g 2 (x) is found to be compatible with zero.",

(14) However, it is not obvious from these relations that the extraction of g 2 is independent of correlated variations in values of F 1 , F 2 and R that conserve the directly measured values of \u03c3 UU . This paper reports a new measurement of the function g 2 and the asymmetry A 2 . The data were collected during the years 2003-2005 with the HERMES spectrometer [16] using a longitudinally polarized positron or electron beam of energy 27.6 GeV scattered off a transversely polarized target [17] of pure hydrogen gas internal to the HERA lepton storage ring at DESY. The usage of a pure target avoids the complications of nuclear corrections present in previous measurements. The open-ended target cell was fed by an atomic-beam source [18] based on Stern-Gerlach separation combined with radio-frequency transitions between hydrogen hyperfine states. The nuclear polarization of the atoms was flipped at 1-3 minute time intervals, while both the polarization magnitude and the atomic fraction inside the target cell were continuously measured [19]. The average magnitude of the proton polarization was 0.78 \u00b1 0.04. The lepton beam (positrons during 2003-2004 and electrons in 2005) was self-polarized in the transverse direction due to the asymmetry in the emission of synchrotron radiation [20] in the arcs of the HERA storage ring. Longitudinal orientation of the beam polarization was obtained by using a pair of spin rotators [21] located before and after the interaction region of the HERMES spectrometer. The sign of the beam polarization was reversed every few months. The beam polarization was measured by two independent HERA polarimeters [22][23][24]. The average magnitude of the beam polarization was found to be 0.34 \u00b1 0.01. The scattered leptons were detected by the HERMES spectrometer within an angular acceptance of \u00b1170 mrad horizontally and \u00b1(40-140) mrad vertically. The leptons were identified using the information from an electromagnetic calorimeter, a transition-radiation detector, a preshower scintillating counter and a dual-radiator ring-imagingCerenkov detector. The identification efficiency for leptons with momentum larger than 2.5 GeV exceeds 98 %, while the hadron contamination in the lepton sample is found to be less than 1 %. The luminosity monitor [25] measured e + e \u2212 (e \u2212 e \u2212 ) pairs from Bhabha (M\u00f8ller) scattering of beam positrons (electrons) off the target gas electrons, and \u03b3 \u03b3 pairs from e + e \u2212 annihilation in two NaBi(WO 4 ) 2 electromagnetic calorimeters, which were mounted symmetrically on either side of the beam line. Tracking corrections were applied for the deflections of the scattered particles caused by the vertical 0.3 T target holding field, with little effect on the extracted asymmetries.",

After applying data quality criteria, 10.2 \u00d7 10 6 events were available for the asymmetry analysis. The kinematic region covered by the experiment in (x, Q 2 )-space was divided into nine bins in x. Each of the seven x-bins in the region x > 0.023 was subdivided into three logarithmically equidistant bins in Q 2 . The range in \u03c6-space (2\u03c0 ) was divided into 10 bins. Two of the \u03c6-bins cover the shielding steel-plate region of the spectrometer and thus cannot be used for the analysis.

The asymmetries evaluated according to (15) were found to be consistent for the two beam helicity states. Therefore they were combined in the further analysis. Finally, the asymmetry given by (15) was unfolded for radiative and instrumental smearing effects to obtain the asymmetry corresponding to single-photon exchange in the scattering process. Radiative corrections were calculated using a Monte-Carlo generator [26]. The unfolding procedure is analogous to that used previously in other HERMES analyses [15,27,28]. It inflates the size of the statistical uncertainties especially in the lowest Q 2 -bins at a given value of x. The magnitude of inflation reaches almost a factor of two at low values of x. The subdivision of x-bins in the range x > 0.023 into three bins in Q 2 decreases the error inflation by about a factor of 1.5 because at larger Q 2 the amount of smearing between x-bins is smaller and the prefactors of A T in (10) and (11) are larger in magnitude. After the unfolding procedure the central values of g 2 and A 2 changed less than the initial statistical uncertainties. As a consequence of the unfolding procedure, the resulting data points are no longer correlated systematically through radiative and instrumental smearing effects, but are only statistically correlated [15]. The procedure generates a statistical covariance matrix for the data points. In every (x, Q 2 )-bin the amplitude A T (x, Q 2 ) was obtained by fitting the unfolded asymmetries with the function f (\u03c6) = \u2212A T (x, Q 2 ) cos \u03c6. Finally, the asymmetry A 2 (x, Q 2 ) and the function g 2 (x, Q 2 ) were evaluated from the amplitude A T and the previously measured function g 1 , for which a world-data parameterization [29] was employed, using (10) and (11).

The uncertainties in the measurements of the beam and target polarizations produce in total a 10 % scale uncertainty on the value of A T . Other sources of systematic uncertainties such as acceptance effects, small beam and spectrometer misalignments, uncertainties in the target polarization direction, correction for track deflection in the vertical target holding field, the unfolding procedure and a possible correlation between prefactors of A T and A T itself in (10) and (11) were evaluated by Monte-Carlo studies. Uncertainties stemming from parameterizations of g 1 (x, Q 2 ), F 2 (x, Q 2 ), and R(x, Q 2 ) were estimated also. In the error propagation to g 2 , the uncertainty in R(x, Q 2 ) was not included in addition to that of F 2 (x, Q 2 ), since they are strongly correlated as explained in [15]. The total systematic uncertainty was evaluated as the quadratic sum of all the considered sources. Its magnitude is less than the magnitude of the statistical uncertainty. Figure 1 shows the values of xg 2 as a function of Q 2 for the bins with x > 0.1, which have sufficient coverage in Q 2 , along with results from the E143 [13] and E155 [14] experiments at SLAC.

The HERMES data are shown for two regions of Q 2 , Q 2 > 1 GeV 2 (closed symbols) and  Wilczek relation (3) using the g 1 (x, Q 2 ) parameterization [29]. The values were calculated at the average Q 2 of HER-MES at each value of x. Within the uncertainties the data satisfy the positivity bound [32] for the asymmetry A 2 , |A 2 | \u2264 \u221a R(1 + A 1 )/2 0.4, for all values of x in the kinematic range of the HERMES experiment.",
