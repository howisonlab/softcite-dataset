            "text": "Violation of the combined charge-conjugation and parity symmetry (CP ) is one of the fundamental ingredients to explain a dynamical generation of the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe [1]. In the Standard Model of particle physics (SM), CP violation in the quark sector is generated by a single complex phase in the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix [2,3]. However, the observed baryon asymmetry is too large to be explained by the SM mechanism alone [4]. Non-leptonic B meson decays dominated by amplitudes involving a quark and a W boson in a loop (penguin) are sensitive to the presence of non-SM physics processes. These processes could provide additional sources of CP violation that might explain the observed baryon asymmetry. The B 0 (s) \u2192 K 0 S h \u00b1 h \u2213 (h, h = \u03c0, K) decays are interesting for CP violation measurements. 1 Knowledge of the branching fractions of the various sub-modes, as reported in this paper, is an important input to the theory of CP -violation, particularly models of new-physics contributions to b \u2192 s transitions ref. [5] . The measurements also allow tests of QCD models (see, for example, the predictions in refs. [6][7][8]). If sufficient data are available, a common approach for three-body decays is to perform an amplitude analysis by studying the structure of the Dalitz plot [9]. If data are less abundant and the decay products originate from intermediate resonances, as in the present analysis, a quasi two-body approach can be used.",

The LHCb detector [17,18] is a single-arm forward spectrometer covering the pseudorapidity range 2 < \u03b7 < 5, designed for the study of particles containing b or c quarks. The detector includes a high-precision tracking system consisting of a silicon-strip vertex detector surrounding the pp interaction region, a large-area silicon-strip detector located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4 Tm, and three stations of silicon-strip detectors and straw drift tubes placed downstream of the magnet. The tracking system provides a measurement of momentum, p, of charged particles with a relative uncertainty that varies from 0.5% at low momentum to 1.0% at 200 GeV/c. The minimum distance of a track to a primary vertex (PV), the impact parameter, is measured with a resolution of (15 + 29/p T ) \u00b5m, where p T is the component of the momentum transverse to the beam, in GeV/c. Different types of charged hadrons are distinguished using information from two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors. Photons, electrons and hadrons are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter and a hadronic calorimeter. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers.",

One category consists of candidates whose decay products satisfy the hadron trigger requirements, while the other consists of candidates from events in which other particles meet the hardware trigger requirements. Only events that fall into either of these categories are used in the subsequent analysis. The software trigger requires a two-, three-or four-particle secondary vertex with a significant displacement from the primary pp interaction points.

Particle identification requirements on the two tracks originating from the B decay vertex are used to separate pions, kaons and protons, and to reduce this background to a negligible level. The largest source of background is due to random tracks that form candidate B or K 0 S decay vertices. A multivariate discriminant based on a boosted decision tree (BDT) algorithm [28,29] is used to reduce this background. The greatest discrimination in the BDT is provided by kinematic properties of the B meson, its flight direction with respect to the PV, and variables defined analogously for its decay products. The optimisation of the BDT is described in ref. [10]; the selection requirement on the BDT response for this analysis is chosen to maximise /(a/2 + \u221a N B ) [30].

The average difference between the yields determined in the pseudoexperiments and the nominal value is taken as a systematic uncertainty.

The cos \u03b8 K * 0 distribution is described by a parabola, where the second-order term represents the signal P wave, the constant term is related to the S wave and the first-order term accounts for the interference. Using the sPlot technique [31], the cos \u03b8 K * 0 distribution of the signal P and S wave is unfolded from the other background components. A fit in the region of positive cos \u03b8 K * 0 is performed using LHCb a second-order polynomial and the systematic uncertainty is determined as the relative difference between the integral of the function when the constant coefficient is allowed to vary and when this coefficient is fixed to zero.
