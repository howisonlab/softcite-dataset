Candidate D 0 mesons are selected using the decay D * + \u2192 D 0 \u03c0 + and the D 0 \u2192 e \u00b1 \u03bc \u2213 branching fraction is measured using the decay mode D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + as a normalization channel. No significant excess of D 0 \u2192 e \u00b1 \u03bc \u2213 candidates over the expected background is seen, and a limit is set on the branching fraction, B(D 0 \u2192 e \u00b1 \u03bc \u2213 ) < 1.3 \u00d7 10 \u22128 , at 90% confidence level. This is an order of magnitude lower than the previous limit and it further constrains the parameter space in some leptoquark models and in supersymmetric models with R-parity violation.",

[1] three extensions to the SM are considered: in a minimal supersymmetric (SUSY) SM with R-parity violation (RPV) the branching fraction B(D 0 \u2192 e \u00b1 \u03bc \u2213 ) could be as large as O(10 \u22126 ); in a theory with multiple Higgs doublets it would be less than about 7 \u00d7 10 \u221210 ; and in the SM extended with extra fermions the branching fraction would be less than O (10 \u221214 ). In Ref. [2] an RPV SUSY model is considered in which limits on products of couplings are obtained from the experimental upper limit on the branching fraction B(D + s \u2192 K + e \u00b1 \u03bc \u2213 ); from these limits, B(D 0 \u2192 e \u00b1 \u03bc \u2213 ) could be as large as 3 \u00d7 10 \u22128 . A similar study of constraints on coupling constants in RPV SUSY [3], obtained from limits on the branching fraction B(D + \u2192 \u03c0 + e \u00b1 \u03bc \u2213 ), showed that B(D 0 \u2192 e \u00b1 \u03bc \u2213 ) could reach 10 \u22127 . LHCb has previously set limits [4] on branching fractions for the B meson decays B 0 \u2192 e \u00b1 \u03bc \u2213 and B 0 s \u2192 e \u00b1 \u03bc \u2213 , using them to put lower limits on the masses of Pati-Salam leptoquarks [5]. As shown in Ref. [6], lepton-flavour violating charm decays are relatively insensitive to the presence of such leptoquarks. However, in a recent paper [7] it is shown that 1 The inclusion of charge-conjugate processes is implied. in other leptoquark scenarios B(D 0 \u2192 e \u00b1 \u03bc \u2213 ) could be as large as",

The most stringent limit is from Belle [11], B(D 0 \u2192 e \u00b1 \u03bc \u2213 ) < 2.6 \u00d7 10 \u22127 at 90% confidence level (CL). An improved limit, below O(10 \u22127 ), would provide tighter constraints on coupling constants in RPV SUSY models [1][2][3], while a limit below 4 \u00d7 10 \u22128 would also constrain the parameter space in some leptoquark models [7]. This Letter presents a search for the decay D 0 \u2192 e \u00b1 \u03bc \u2213 using pp collision data corresponding to integrated luminosities of 1.0 fb \u22121 at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV and 2.0 fb \u22121 at 8 TeV, collected by the LHCb experiment in 2011 and 2012, respectively. In the analysis, signal candidates are selected using the decay D * + \u2192 D 0 \u03c0 + and the measurements are normalized using the well-measured channel D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + , which has the same topology as the signal. A multivariate analysis based on a boosted decision tree algorithm (BDT) is used to help separate signal and background. The mass spectrum in the signal region, defined as 1815-1915 MeV/c 2 , is not examined until all analysis choices are finalized.",

The background sample used for the training comprises selected candidates with invariant mass within 300 MeV/c 2 of the known D 0 mass, but excluding the signal region, 1815-1915 MeV/c 2 . The training for signal is done with the simulated D 0 \u2192 e \u00b1 \u03bc \u2213 events. One half of each sample is used for training the BDT, while the other half is used to test for over-training. No evidence for over-training is seen. Following procedures used in Refs. [25,26], the BDT output value, which lies between \u22121 (most background-like) and 1 (most signal-like), is used to separate the data sample into three subsamples with ranges chosen to give optimum separation between the background-only and signal-plus-background hypotheses. The D 0 \u2192 e \u00b1 \u03bc \u2213 signal probability density functions (PDF) in the three BDT bins are obtained from the simulation. The simulated D 0 \u2192 e \u00b1 \u03bc \u2213 mass spectra are fitted using the sum of two Crystal Ball functions [27] with a common peak value but different widths. One of the Crystal Ball functions has a low-mass tail to account for energy loss due to bremsstrahlung while the other is modified to have a high-mass tail to accommodate events where a bremsstrahlung photon is incorrectly assigned to an electron candidate. The per-event particle multiplicity affects the amount of bremsstrahlung radiation recovered for the electron candidates, and this differs between simulation and data. Therefore both the simulation and the data are classified in three bins of the variable N SPD , the number of hits in the scintillating pad detector, which is a measure of the particle multiplicity. The parameters of the signal PDF are obtained as averages of their values in the three bins of N SPD , weighted to account for data-simulation differences. The PDF shapes for the peaking background due to misidentified D 0 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decays (see Fig. 1) are obtained in the same way as for D 0 \u2192 e \u00b1 \u03bc \u2213 , using the same functional form for the signal shapes, and their yields are Gaussian-constrained in the fits.

The expected and observed CL S values as functions of the assumed branching fraction are shown in Fig. 4, where the expected CL S values are obtained using an Asimov dataset [30] as described in Ref. [31], and are the median expected limits under the assumption of no signal. Expected limits based on pseudoexperiments give consistent results.

This limit will help to further constrain products of couplings in supersymmetric models that incorporate R-parity violation [1][2][3] and constrains the parameter space in some leptoquark scenarios [7]. In summary, a search for the lepton-flavour violating decay D 0 \u2192 e \u00b1 \u03bc \u2213 is performed on a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3.0 fb \u22121 collected in pp collisions at centre-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 TeV. The data are consistent with the background-only hypothesis, and a limit is set on the branching fraction, B(D 0 \u2192 e \u00b1 \u03bc \u2213 ) < 1.3 \u00d7 10 \u22128 at 90% CL, which is an order of magnitude lower than the previous limit.
