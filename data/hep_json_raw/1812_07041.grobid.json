Measurements of A CP provide an estimate of the imaginary part of the penguin-to-tree amplitude ratio for the b \u2192 ccd transition. Similarly to the B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c1 0 decay [2], the CP asymmetry is expected to be enhanced in this decay compared to the decay B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c6 [3,4]. Therefore its value can be used to place constraints on penguin effects in measurements of the CP-violating phase \u03c6 s from the decay B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c6, assuming approximate SU(3) flavour symmetry and neglecting exchange and annihilation diagrams. The branching fraction and the value of A CP for B + \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c1 + decays were measured previously by the BaBar collaboration to be (5.0 \u00b1 0.7 \u00b1 0.3) \u00d7 10 \u22125 and \u22120.11 \u00b1 0.12 \u00b1 0.08, respectively [5].",

To reject background from B + \u2192 J/\u03c8 K * + decays, 2 with K * + \u2192 K + \u03c0 0 , where a kaon is misidentified as a pion, a stringent criterion is placed on the pion-identification quality, which is mainly derived using information from the two RICH detectors. The neutral pion is reconstructed from two well-separated clusters in the electromagnetic calorimeter. It is required to have a p T larger than 800 MeV/c. The \u03c1 + candidate must have a transverse momentum larger than 800 MeV/c and an invariant mass m \u03c0 + \u03b3 \u03b3 between 400 and 1100 MeV/c 2 .",

The efficiencies \u03b5 B + \u2192J/\u03c8 K + and \u03b5 B + \u2192J/\u03c8 \u03c1 + are composed of the geometrical acceptance, trigger, reconstruction, particle identification and selection efficiencies. In addition, there is an efficiency due to the removal of multiple candidates in the B + \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c1 + sample. The efficiency for the decay products of a B + \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c1 + or B + \u2192 J/\u03c8 K + decay to be within the acceptance of the LHCb detector is taken from simulation. The efficiency to trigger on one or both muons from the J/\u03c8 decay is also taken from simulation. When forming the ratio of branching fractions between the B + \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c1 + and B + \u2192 J/\u03c8 K + decays, the ratio of trigger efficiencies is close to unity. The charged-particle reconstruction efficiency is taken from simulation with kinematics-dependent correction factors applied that are determined using a tag-and-probe technique applied on a detached J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 data sample [26]. The \u03c0 0 reconstruction efficiency is also obtained from simulation, with a p T -dependent correction factor obtained from the deviation between the known and observed ratio of branching fractions of B + \u2192 J/\u03c8 K + and B + \u2192 J/\u03c8 K * + decays, with K * + \u2192 K + \u03c0 0 followed by \u03c0 0 \u2192 \u03b3 \u03b3 [27]. Data samples of B + \u2192 J/\u03c8 K + and B + \u2192 J/\u03c8 K * + decays, collected in 2011 and 2012 by the LHCb experiment, are fitted to obtain the number of observed decays. After correcting for the charged-particle selection efficiencies, the double ratio between the ratio of observed decays and the ratio of known branching fractions is the efficiency to reconstruct a \u03c0 0 meson. This result is compared to the \u03c0 0 efficiency obtained from simulated samples to determine the correction factors in intervals of the p T of the \u03c0 0 meson. Using this procedure, the uncertainty on the branching fraction of the B + \u2192 J/\u03c8 K + decay cancels in the measurement of the B + \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c1 + branching fraction, and only the uncertainty on the branching fraction of the B + \u2192 J/\u03c8 K * + decay contributes.",

            "text": "The largest contributions come from the uncertainty on the knowledge of the direct CP asymmetry of the B + \u2192 J/\u03c8 K * + decay for the partially reconstructed background, and the limited knowledge of the production asymmetry for B + mesons in the 2011 and 2012 data sets. The signal model is again replaced by a two-dimensional kernel density estimator to take possible correlations into account, taking the difference in the CP-asymmetry results as a systematic uncertainty. The ratio of the positive and negative pion detection efficiencies \u03b5(\u03c0 + )/\u03b5(\u03c0 \u2212 ) has been measured at the LHCb experiment [12] and found to be compatible with unity over a broad range of momenta and transverse momenta, with an uncertainty of about 0.5%. This uncertainty is added as a systematic uncertainty for A CP . To evaluate a possible bias on the asymmetry result, a permutation test is performed where the data set is split 1000 times randomly, instead of by the charge of the B + meson, and the asymmetry is evaluated. As an additional check, simulated decays are added to each of these randomly split samples, corresponding to \u00b15% and \u00b110% asymmetry, to assess the robustness of the asymmetry fit for a non-zero A CP value. No bias in the resulting distributions is observed. The total systematic uncertainty for A CP is formed by adding all individual components in quadrature.",
