In order to make this problem more tractable while avoiding the prejudices of specific UV completions (e.g. CMSSM), the ATLAS and CMS experiments have adopted the strategy of distilling theoretical scenarios into \"Simplified Models\" [1,2,3] that reduce the parameters of the theory to those that directly affect the experimental observability of the supersymmetric signal. While this has been a significant improvement in the way LHC experimental constraints on supersymmetry are presented, this approach also has a number of shortcomings. In this Letter, we present an extension of the simplified model approach that addresses one such limitation, namely the commonly made, though often unrealistic assumption that any new particles produced will have 100% Branching Ratio (BR) into the experimental final states over which the search is conducted.",

Models with branching ratios of a particle into two independent final states all lie on a straight line given the constraint on the total branching ratio. Similarly, all models of the particle with three independent decay modes are confined to a triangle since there are only two free parameters. Note that models with greater than 3 decay final states cannot be visualized in the same manner on a 2-dimensional plot. Nevertheless, all models with upto three decay final states can be presented by adopting the triangle visualization method. Let us denote the three decay branching fractions of a supersymmetric particle as B A , B B , and B C . The space spanned by scanning over values of (B A , B B , B C ) is a triangular plane.

The rest of the triangle, however, contains more realistic scenarios with multiple decay modes of the parent particle that have not been explicitly confronted with LHC data (though in principle they could be). In fact, the advantages of such triangular visualization have already been demonstrated in two non-supersymmetric BSM analyses, namely the search for vector-like top partners, \"T quarks\" [4,5]. Since a T quark can decay into three final states: bW, tZ or tH, by presenting the experimental constraints on triangles, CMS and ATLAS were able to conduct the search without making any assumptions on the branching fractions and place the most stringent bounds on the entire parameter space. In this work, we apply the triangle visualization approach to searches for supersymmetry where it will be useful, given the fact that most supersymmetric particles decay into multiple final states as stated in the Introduction.

By requiring \u2206\u03c6 min > 4.0, most of the QCD background was eliminated. The observed number of events in several signal regions was consistent with the expected SM backgrounds and 95% upper limits on the presence of new physics were extracted. The upper limits were interpreted as bounds on gluino production in two different SMS: (i) 100 % branching ratio ofg \u2192 bb\u03c7 0 1 (T1bbbb) and (ii) 100 % branching ratio ofg \u2192 tt\u03c7 0 1 (T1tttt). By requiring b-jets and vetoing events with leptons, the search was most sensitive to the T1bbbb SMS. At 95% C.L., gluinos lighter than 1170 GeV were excluded in the T1bbbb SMS and gluinos lighter than 1050 GeV in the T1tttt SMS. In this section, we will show that the results from the \"\u2206\u03c6\" analysis in Ref. [6] can be reinterpreted to obtain stringent constraints on a wide range of more realistic models with the triangle visualization approach.",

PYTHIA decays the gluino pair according to the branching ratios at the point on the triangle and hadronizes the decay products. Next, a detector simulation is employed to estimate the Acceptance \u00d7 Efficiency (A \u00d7 \u03b5) for these signal events to pass the selection criteria of Ref. [6]. While the most accurate estimation of A \u00d7 \u03b5 can only be achieved by a full GEANT [8] simulation of the detector (which can only be performed by the experimental collaborations), a decent parametric simulation of the detector is sufficient for our purposes and for this we use Delphes 3.0.9 [9]. We use the default \"CMS\" detector card provided by Delphes adapted to account for the electron and muon isolation criteria applied in the CMS analysis and modified to match the track and jet reconstruction parameters quoted in Ref.

The expected number of signal events, N sig = \u03c3 NLO \u00d7 Ldt \u00d7 (A \u00d7 \u03b5), obtained in this manner are compared to the observed number of events quoted by the experimental collaboration in their published analysis [6].

There is a kinematic lower bound on the gluino mass for each model. In addition, the experimental efficiencies degrade rapidly for small mass differences between the gluino and LSP due to the relatively low momenta of the decays products. Consequently, the bounds do not extend all the way to zero-mass of the gluino and we consider the range of gluino mass specified by the analysis, which in this case is 400 GeV and above.

At these two vertices, we find that gluinos lighter than 1200 and 1080 GeV are excluded respectively. These results agree with those published in Ref.

For instance, from Fig. 2 we can immediately see that with about 65% branching ratio into bb\u03c7 0 1 and 35% branching ratio into tt\u03c7 0 1 , the limits are as strong as the T1bbbb SMS. An additional benefit that the triangle visualization approach provides can be seen by allowing the third vertex of the triangle to determine the constraints in models with the least efficiency for signal events to pass the kinematic selection criteria. For example, events from gluino decays into qq\u03c7 0 1 , where q = u, d, c, s are less likely to pass the b-tagged jet selection criterion in the \u2206\u03c6 analysis since the final states do not contain any b quarks. Consequently, the simplified model T1qqqq has weaker bounds on it coming from this analysis, but it is also evident from Fig. 2 that with only 20% decay branching ratio into bb\u03c7 0 , the constraints on the gluino mass very rapidly increase to 1000 GeV. By studying final states that have very different efficiencies of populating the signal regions on a single triangle, one can constrain a wide range of models with a given experimental analysis.",

Consider model A with equal gluino branching ratios into qq\u03c7 0 1 , bb\u03c7 0 1 , tt\u03c7 0 1 ( in Fig. 1). By locating this model at the centroid of the triangle in Fig. 2 one can obtain an accurate lower bound of 1050 GeV on the gluino mass. Now consider model B that has 20% branching ratio into bb\u03c7 0 1 , 20% into tt\u03c7 0 1 , and the remaining 60% into states that are not shown on this triangle. We can still obtain a lower bound on the gluino mass of at least 1000 GeV by locating the model \u2022 on the triangle in Fig. 2. Since this bound is obtained by assuming that the remaining 60% of the gluino decay products would have significantly less efficiency of passing the selection criteria of the dedicated experimental analysis, the actual bound would be between 1000 -1200 GeV. And lastly, consider model C with 30% branching ratio to bb\u03c7 0 1 and 70% branching ratio into final states that are also not shown on the triangle. In this case, we can still infer that the given experimental search excludes gluino masses between 1000 -1200 GeV from the grid line corresponding to 30% decays into bb\u03c7 0 1 . The bounds obtained for models B and C assume that A \u00d7 \u03b5 for the modes not pictured in the triangle are equal or larger than those for T1qqqq. This assumption is valid since, by construction, the third vertex was chosen to be a decay mode with very small efficiency of passing the cuts. For the model T1qqqq, we find that A \u00d7 \u03b5 < 10 \u22124 . Therefore, this construction enables us to obtain bounds for models even when all the BRs are not pictured on the triangle.",

The exclusion limits depend on the mass difference between the gluino (or any other su-persymmetric particle in study) and the LSP and typically the limits are strongest when the mass difference is large. Nevertheless, the SMS is a single point in the model parameter space and by extending the model space to include up to three decay final states we sacrifice information on how the limits change with the mass difference.

            "text": "First, consider supersymmetric scenarios with heavy scalars superpartners and lighter gauginos (e.g. split supersymmetry). In these models, loop decays of the gluino into g\u03c7 0 i are sizeable due to the large mass of the scalars that mediate the three body decays. In addition, the third family of scalars: the stop, sbottom and stau may be lighter than the scalars of the first and second family, due to renormalization group running. Therefore, decays to bb\u03c7 0 i , tt\u03c7 0 i are also present in these scenarios. The results of the \u2206\u03c6 analysis reinterpreted for models with heavy scalars and dominant decays into g\u03c7 0 1 , bb\u03c7 0 1 , tt\u03c7 0 1 is shown in Fig. 3(a). Notice that the only difference from the triangle shown in Fig. 2 is the g\u03c7 0 1 decay mode. Here there is sufficient gluon radiation followed by g \u2192 bb such that events pass the b-tagged jets criterion of the \u2206\u03c6 analysis with reasonable efficiency; hence the constraints are stronger in models with 100% decays into g\u03c7 0 i , when compared to models with 100% decays into qq\u03c7 0 1 . Similarly, in models with light charginos, the tb\u03c7 \u00b1 1 decay mode will usually dominate [13]. In addition, decays to bb\u03c7 0 2 , tt\u03c7 0 2 (or to heavier neutralinos) will also be present if there are other states lighter than the gluino. Although it is impossible to visualize all the different decay possibilities on a single 2-dimensional plot, notice that many of the decays produce very similar final states at the current resolution level of the searches. The decays tb\u03c7 \u00b1 1 and tt\u03c7 0 1 , for instance, both produce 2 W bosons, 4 b-quarks, and missing energy when m\u03c7 \u00b1 1 \u2212 m\u03c70 1 > m W (Here we assume m\u03c7 \u00b1 1 , m\u03c70 2 2m\u03c70 1 ). Consequently, we obtain the same exclusion limits on models with either of these two decay branching ratios. As another example consider the decays of tb\u03c7 \u00b1 1 , bb\u03c7 0 2 , tt\u03c7 0 2 that produce multiple b-jets and missing energy. As a result, from Fig. 3(b) we can see that even though they are weaker than the T1bbbb or T1tttt SMS (since a fraction of the\u03c7 0 2 ,\u03c7 \u00b1 1 decay into leptons and events with leptons are vetoed by the \u2206\u03c6 analysis), the exclusion limits are again similar for all three decays. Overall, the \u2206\u03c6 analysis (and most other hadronic searches) has the same sensitivity to models with any combination of these final states and we expect the exclusion limits to be very similar.",

With this approach, at the vertices of the triangle experimentalists can still report exclusions on the SMS that are presently being constrained in CMS and ATLAS publications, but one can also present limits on models with mixed final states that are usually omitted in these papers. This is important since in such models the constraints on supersymmetric particles can be very different from the SMS results depending on the efficiency of the mixed states to populate the signal regions. We also think the triangular visualization will be useful to theorists. It allows them to use existing published SMS results and interpret them as bounds on supersymmetric particles in specific models that make specific branching ratio predictions. Examples of this in the context of constraints on the gluino in SUSY scenarios were given. We hope we have demonstrated that the triangular visualization approach would significantly improve the utility of the experimental results being reported by the CMS and ATLAS collaborations. Presentation of results in this form, in addition to the usual exclusion limits on the 2-dimensional (M LS P vs Mg) plot will maximize the information presented and makes it relatively easy to reinterpret the results for particular models with different decay configurations. We encourage the high energy physics community to consider adopting this presentation strategy as they prepare for Run 2 of the LHC 1 , 2 .",
