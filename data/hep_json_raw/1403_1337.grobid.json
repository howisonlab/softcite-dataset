            "text": "The BESIII experiment in Beijing takes data in \u03c4 -charm domain since 2009. For the moment the world largest samples of J/\u03c8, \u03c8(3686), \u03c8(3770) and \u03c8(4040) data have been collected. Hadron spectroscopy is a unique way to access QCD, which is one of the most important physics goals of BESIII. Experimental search of new forms of hadrons and subsequent investigation of their properties would provide validation of and valuable input to the quantitative understanding of QCD. The key to success lies in high levels of precision during the measurement and high statistics in the recorded data set complemented with sophisticated analysis methods. Partial wave analysis (PWA) is a powerful tool to study the hadron spectroscopy, that allows one to extract the resonance's spin-parity, mass, width and decay properties with high sensitivity and accuracy. In this poster, we present the working PWA framework of BESIII -GPUPWA and the recent results of PWA of J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7\u03b7. GPUPWA is a PWA framework for high statistics partial wave analyses harnessing the GPU parallel computing.",

From the experimental side, the basic task is to systematically map out all the resonances with the determination of their properties like mass, width, spin-parity as well as partial decays widths.",

            "text": "Extracting resonance properties from experimental data is however far from straightforward; resonances tend to be broad and plentiful, leading to intricate interference patterns. In such an environment, simple fitting of mass spectra is usually not sufficient and a partial wave analysis (PWA) is required to disentangle interference effects and to extract resonance properties. In the cases discussed here, the full kinematic information is used and fitted to a model of the amplitude in a partial wave decomposition. The partial wave amplitude is constructed with an angular part and a dynamical part. The model parameters are determined by an unbinned likelihood fit to the data, while the event-wise efficiency correction is included. In a typical PWA (we use the radiative decay J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7\u03b7 8 as an example), the quasi two-body decay amplitudes (isobar model) in the sequential decay process J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3X, X \u2192 \u03b7\u03b7 are constructed using covariant tensor amplitudes described in Ref. 9.",

PWA results of J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7\u03b7 For a J/\u03c8 radiative decay to two pseudoscalar mesons, it offers a very clean laboratory to search for scalar and tensor glueballs because only intermediate states with J P C = even ++ are possible. An early study of J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7\u03b7 was made by the Crystal Ball Collaboration with the first observation of f 0 (1710), but the study suffered from low statistics.

            "text": "A full partial wave analysis was performed to disentangle the structures present in J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7\u03b7 decays. The scalar contributions are mainly from f 0 (1500), f 0 (1710) and f 0 (2100), while no evident contributions from f 0 (1370) and f 0 (1790) are seen. Recently, the production rate of the pure gauge scalar glueball in J/r radiative decays predicted by the lattice QCD 14 was found to be compatible with the production rate of J/\u03c8 radiative decays to f 0 (1710); this suggests that f 0 (1710) has a larger overlap with the glueball compared to other glueball candidates (eg. f 0 (1500)). In this analysis, the production rate of f 0 (1710) and f 0 (2100) are both about one order of magnitude larger than that of the f 0 (1500), which are both consistent with, at least not contrary to, lattice QCD predictions 14 . Now five years from our first collisions, BESIII has established a broad and successful program in charm physics. Recently, in 2012, even larger samples have been accumulated at the J/\u03c8 and \u03c8(3686); total samples are now about 1.2 billion and 0.35 billion decays, respectively. Furthermore, our 2013 dataset includes more data near 4260 MeV, and also a large sample at the Y (4360). With the excellent performance of the accelerator and detector, more interesting results are expected.",
