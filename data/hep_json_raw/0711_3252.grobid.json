However, some difficulties arise when it is applied to exclusive decays. For example, certain sum rules (in particular, the Uraltsev sum rule [2]) imply the strong dominance of decays to the narrow excited D mesons over those to the wide excited D mesons, while some experimental data show the opposite trend [3,4]. However, no complete experimental study of such semileptonic decays to excited D-mesons exists, and thus no direct comparison with theoretical predictions can be performed. In this paper we report on a study of B \u2192 D ( * ) \u03c0\u2113\u03bd decays and measure the excited D contributions to the D ( * ) \u03c0 final state.",

Members of the j q = 3/2 doublet are predicted to decay only via a D-wave and be relatively narrow, while members of the j q = 1/2 doublet are predicted to decay only via an S-wave and be relatively broad [5]. The D * * states with spin-parity and light quark angular momentum combinations 0 + (j q = 1/2), 1 + (j q = 1/2), 1 + (j q = 3/2) and 2 + (j q = 3/2) are usually labelled D * 0 , D \u2032 1 , D 1 and D * 2 , respectively. The D * * states have previously been observed and studied in hadronic B-decays [6]. Semileptonic B decays to narrow D 1 and D * 2 mesons have been studied by a number of experiments [7]. The semileptonic branching fractions of B \u2192 D ( * ) \u03c0\u2113\u03bd decays were recently measured by Belle [8] and BaBar [9].",

The Belle detector is a large-solid-angle magnetic spectrometer that consists of a silicon vertex detector (SVD), a 50-layer central drift chamber (CDC), an array of aerogel threshold Cherenkov counters (ACC), a barrel-like arrangement of time-of-flight scintillation counters (TOF), and an electromagnetic calorimeter comprised of CsI(Tl) crystals (ECL) located inside a superconducting solenoid coil that provides a 1.5 T magnetic field. An iron flux-return located outside the coil is instrumented to detect K 0 L mesons and to identify muons (KLM). The detector is described in detail elsewhere [11]. Two inner detector configurations were used. A 2.0 cm beam pipe and a 3-layer silicon vertex detector was used for the first sample of 152 million BB pairs, while a 1.5 cm beam pipe, a 4-layer silicon detector and a small-cell inner drift chamber were used to record the remaining 504 million BB pairs [12].",

            "text": "A study of the sidebands shows that the background is described by the sum of a signal function and an exponential. The resulting signal function and contributions from the resonances are shown in Fig. 2 as solid and dashed curves, respectively, superimposed on the background-subtracted mass spectra. In the insets the solid and dashed curves represent the fitted signal and background, respectively. In B 0 \u2192 D * \u03c0\u2113\u03bd decays a small feature may be observed around 2.6 GeV/c 2 , which is absent in B + \u2192 D * \u03c0\u2113\u03bd. However, the significance of this feature is small (2.5\u03c3) and there is no known state there, so we do not include a term for it in the fit. Fitted resonance yields and corresponding product branching ratios are listed in Table II. The contribution of the non-resonant component in all cases is consistent with zero. The B \u2192 D * * \u2113\u03bd decay significance is defined as \u22122 ln L max /L 0 , where L 0 is the likelihood value returned by the fit to the D ( * ) \u03c0 distribution with the D * * contribution fixed to zero. Our result for B \u2192D 1 \u2113 + \u03bd is in good agreement with previous measurements [7]. For a D * 0 +D * 2 hypothesis the branching ratio of the decay to the wide D * 0 is large, in contrast to theoretical predictions [4]. However, the present statistics do not definitely exclude an interpretation of broadly distributed D\u03c0 + events as the D * v tail. For D * , * * 's decaying into D\u03c0 we perform a study of the helicity angle distributions, which is the angle between \u03c0 momentum and the direction opposite to B sl -momentum in the D * , * * rest frame. To extract the D * v , D * 0 and the D * 2 helicity distributions we perform a combined fit of the M(D\u03c0) spectra for D\u03c0 combinations from both B + and B 0 in bins of helicity angle. The fit procedure is identical to that used for the B(B \u2192 D * , * * \u2113\u03bd) calculation. The results corrected for the efficiency are plotted in Fig. 3. D * 2 distributions for D * v and D * 0 hypothesis coincide within errors, so that only that for the D * 0 + D * 2 case is shown in Fig. 3 c. The D * 0 helicity distribution is consistent with the J = 0 hypothesis (\u03c7 2 /ndf = 6.0/4, where ndf is the number of degrees of freedom). The D * 2 helicity distribution is fitted efficiency dependence due to the decay model was studied using two different signal MC samples generated with the ISGW2 [19] and Goity-Roberts [16] models. To estimate the systematic uncertainty in background subtraction we used two different sets of sidebands with appropriate normalizations. To estimate interference effects we perform MC study with different angle efficiency dependencies. A summary of the systematic error contributions is presented in Table III. In total we obtain a 14% error for the B \u2192 D ( * ) \u03c0\u2113\u03bd measurement, a 16% error for the narrow D * * contribution and 25% for the measurement of the wide D * * contribution. In conclusion, we report measurements of the branching fractions for B \u2192 D ( * ) \u03c0\u2113\u03bd decays. These measurements supersede our previous results [8]. We also performed an analysis of the final state D ( * ) \u03c0 hadronic system and obtained branching ratios for the B \u2192 D * * \u2113\u03bd components. Semileptonic decay to D * 2 meson is observed and measured for the first time. Helicity and w distributions are studied for this decay. We observe a broad enhancement in the D\u03c0 mass distribution consistent with wide D * 0 production. The branching ratio of the decay to B \u2192 D * 0 \u2113\u03bd is found to be large, in contrast with theoretical predictions [4]. However there is no indication of a broad D \u2032 1 in the B \u2192 D * \u03c0\u2113\u03bd channel, which should be of the same order. The combined likelihood of fits to the D\u03c0 mass, helicity and w distributions for D * 0 + D * 2 hypothesis is higher than that for the D ",

A simultaneous fit to the w-distributions for D * 0 and D * 2 gives\u03c4 \u2032 3/2 = \u22121.8 \u00b1 0.3. Using the measured branching ratios of B \u2192 D * 0,2 \u2113\u03bd, we also calculate \u03c4 3/2 (1) = 0.75 and \u03c4 1/2 (1) = 1.28. All parameters are in agreement with expectations except for \u03c4 1/2 (1), which is larger than predicted due to the large value of B(B \u2192 D * 0 \u2113\u03bd). The systematic error in the calculation of branching fractions due to B tag efficiency uncertainty cancelled out since normalization modes were used. The largest contribution to the systematic error is from uncertainty in D * * parameters. We perform a D ( * ) \u03c0 mass study with these parameters allowed to float inside their errors to get it.
