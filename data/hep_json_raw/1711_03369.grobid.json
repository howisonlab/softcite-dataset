            "text": "The study of Pb-Pb collisions in the LHC energy regime provides insight on the properties of nuclear matter at extreme conditions of temperature and energy density, where lattice QCD predicts the matter to be in a Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) state [1]. Properties of the QGP medium, such as shear viscosity to entropy ratio, electromagnetic radiation and energy loss are the focus of past, present and future proposed measurements. In addition, in recent years, the investigation of the properties of small systems (i.e. pp and p-A collisions) has taken up an important role. Since the first experimental evidence of long-range near-side angular correlations in high multiplicity pp [2] and p-Pb [3] interactions a large e\u21b5ort has been made to measure the small system properties as a function of the event multiplicity in order to understand the possible onset of collectivity and its implications. ALICE [4] is the dedicated heavy ion experiment at the LHC. It is equipped with excellent particle identification (PID) and tracking capabilities down to very low transverse momentum (p T ). The aforementioned properties make ALICE unique in measuring identified particles spectra, (anti-)(hyper-) nuclei production and in reconstructing decays of heavy-flavour hadrons by resolving their secondary decay vertices both in small systems and in heavy-ion collisions. In the next sections, an overview of recent ALICE results from LHC run I and II data is presented with particular focus on strangeness, hard probes, nuclei production and collectivity. It has to be noted that, at the moment this manuscript was written, the LHC run II is still ongoing. At present ALICE collected an integrated Pb-Pb luminosity of \u21e0 250 \u00b5b \u22121 during the 2015 data taking while an additional \u21e0 750 \u00b5b \u22121 is expected by the end of 2018 for a total run II Pb-Pb integrated luminosity of L int \u21e0 1 nb \u22121 . Finally, the ALICE Collaboration is preparing the upgrade of the detector, which will take place during LHC long shutdown 2 in 2019, when, among other upgrades, the inner tracking system and the readout chambers of the Time Projection Chamber will be fully replaced [5].",

The investigation of strangeness production at RHIC and LHC, revealed several features, such as the baryon to meson anomaly and the enhancement decreasing with the increase in collision energy, which triggered further theoretical investigations [8]. Quark coalescence has been used to explain the intermediate-p T baryon to meson enhancement [11], while statistical hadronization models succeeded in describing hadron yields using a grand-canonical approach [12]. In the statistical model, the lower production of strangeness in small systems (pp collisions) is understood as the consequence of the small phase-space volume available, and it is referred to as canonical suppression [13] .

The Inner Tracking System and the Time Projection Chamber are used for secondary vertex determination, tracking and PID through specific energy loss measurements. Recent measurements by the ALICE experiment [16] show that strangeness enhancement is also present in high-multiplicity pp and p-Pb events. Moreover, the \u21e4/K 0 s ratio shows a qualitatively similar behavior in p-Pb and Pb-Pb collisions [17]. Therefore, the study of strangeness production in small and large systems acquires a fundamental importance in the investigation of the origin of the heavy-ion-like e\u21b5ects found in small systems [18]. The preliminary measurement of the production yield of strange and multi-strange hadrons in Pb-Pb at p s NN = 5.02 TeV was shown for the first time at this conference. As example, in the left panel of figure 1 the integrated production yield of \u2305 \u2212 + \u2305 + normalized to charged pions is shown as a function of the charged-particle multiplicity hdN ch /d\u2318i |y|<0.5 for the three di\u21b5erent collision systems. The right panel shows the same ratio for the \u21e4 baryon. The results provide clear evidence that in high multiplicity pp interactions strangeness enhancement is comparable with p-Pb and peripheral Pb-Pb. While the general behavior of the finding can be understood using the grand canonical approach, all the generators and models fail to reproduce the shape and/or the magnitude of the e\u21b5ect [16,19].",

Furthermore, the in-medium thermal production is expected to be negligible [23]. In addition, if in-medium hadronization contributes to charm hadron formation at low-p T , then strange charm hadrons (i.e. D + s ) should be enhanced relative to non-strange charm hadrons [24]. Recently ALICE released the first measurement of two charmed baryon to meson ratios in pp and p-Pb collisions at central rapidity at p s = 7 TeV and p s NN = 5.02 TeV respectively (\u21e4 c /D 0 and \u2305 c /D 0 ) [38]. Both results challenge models and point toward something not well understood in the fragmentation of charm quark into baryons. The measured \u21e4 c /D 0 ratio shown in the left panel of figure 2 is a factor 2-5 higher than all the models considered. In this regard it is interesting to note that only PYTHIA8 with color reconnection can qualitatively reproduce the shape of the measured ratio In Pb-Pb collisions the interactions with the produced medium can be studied via the nuclear modification factor, R AA , defined as the ratio between the yields measured in Pb-Pb and pp collisions after normalizing the Pb-Pb yield to the average number of nucleon-nucleon collisions in the considered centrality class. It is expected that the medium created in the collision a\u21b5ects the momentum spectra of the originally produced hard probes, resulting in a value of R AA di\u21b5erent from unity. It has however to be considered that other e\u21b5ects related to the presence of nuclei in the initial state can break the expected binary scaling due to the cold-nuclear matter e\u21b5ects (CNM) (e.g. nuclear modifications of the PDFs, Cronin enhancement). By measuring an R pPb of D mesons compatible with unity in a wide p T range [26] ALICE suggests that CNM e\u21b5ects are small at the LHC. In the left panel of figure 3 the non-strange D mesons R AA and the D + s R AA are shown for the 10% most central Pb-Pb collisions. The large suppression found, factor 5-6 at p T \u21e0 10 GeV/c cannot be explained by CNM e\u21b5ects and therefore is attributed to a final state e\u21b5ect. It has to be noted that the data show  Quarkonium states are also expected to be suppressed (R AA < 1) in the QGP, due to the color screening of the force which binds the cc (or bb) state. Quarkonium suppression is expected to occur sequentially according to the binding energy of each meson: strongly bound states like J/ and \u2325(1S) should melt at higher temperatures with respect to more loosely bound states [27,28]. At LHC energies, it is predicted that the more abundant production of charm quarks would lead to charmonium regeneration from recombination of c and c quarks at the hadronization level, resulting in an enhancement in the number of observed J/ [29]. The right panel of figure 3 shows the R AA of J/ measured at central rapidity (|y|<0.9) via the decay channel J/ ! e + e \u2212 compared with the same observable measured at forward rapidity (2.5<y<4) via the decay channel J/ ! \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 . The measurement at central rapidity suggests a di\u21b5erent behavior at low-p T with respect to the forward rapidity measurement. This is consistent with the possibility of a stronger regeneration of central rapidity [30]. However, the large uncertainties of the central-rapidity measurement prevent a clear conclusion on this point.",

            "text": "The collective motions arising from the large pressure gradients generated by compressing and heating the nuclear matter is a typical feature of the medium produced in heavy-ion collisions. The radial flow, generated by the collective expansion of the fireball, is studied by measuring the transverse momentum spectra of identified hadrons [32]. The radial flow velocity at the thermal freeze-out, is estimated via a blast-wave fit. In the Blast Wave model [41], radial flow breaks the m T -scaling present in the non-flowing case. Heavier particles gain more momentum from the common collective flow field and this leads to a mass ordering of elliptic flow at low-p T . Indeed a mass ordering in the measurement of elliptic flow of \u21e1 \u00b1 , K \u00b1 , p + p, \u03c6, \u2326 \u00b1 and \u2305 \u00b1 was found by ALICE with data from the first LHC Pb-Pb run at p s NN = 2.76 TeV [31]. The study also provided evidence for constituent quark scaling [33][34][35]     D-mesons in the centrality range 30 \u2212 50% , measured with event plane method [36], is compared to charged pion v 2 . The measurement [37] shows that D-mesons have a positive v 2 in range 2 < p T < 10 GeV/c indicating that charm quark takes part in the collective motion of the system. At higher p T , v 2 is compatible with 0 within uncertainties. In the right panel of the same figure the J/ elliptic flow is shown as measured by ALICE at forward (2.5 < y < 4) and central (|y| < 0.9) rapidities. While the large error bars of the measurement at central rapidity do not allow for a quantitative comparison with theory calculations [39], for the forward rapidity measurement, at low p T , the theory calculation [40] is able to reproduce the magnitude of the measured v 2 by adding a strong J/ regeneration component while at high-p T the magnitude of the v 2 is underestimated.",

The observation suggests an increasing radial flow with increasing centrality. Moreover, in the right panel of the same figure, the ratio between the production spectra of deuteron and anti-deuteron is shown to be compatible with unity. This observation is compatible with expectations from the statistical hadronisation [44] and the hadron coalescence models [45].

The large sample collected during the second Pb-Pb run at LHC allowed ALICE to enter a precision hera for many observables (e.g. strangeness production and collectivity in Pb-Pb). In terms of azimuthal anisotropy, measurements of the v 3 and v 4 of identified particles set additional tight constraints to models. In the heavy-flavour sector ALICE released the first measurement of the charmed baryon to meson ratio in pp and p-Pb interactions at central rapidity at LHC. Such a measurement constitutes, at present, a challenge for models of charm fragmentation. There are interesting hints for collective behavior in high-multiplicity pp and p-Pb collision, one of them being the measurement of the Q CP of non-strange D mesons. However, the low significance and the fact that the e\u21b5ect of a Color Glass Condensate or other cold matter e\u21b5ects may yet provide an alternative explanation for the observed behavior make the measurement not yet conclusive. The excellent PID capabilities enable ALICE to perform high precision nuclei measurements. At this conference ALICE presented precision measurements of deuteron and antideuteuteron production in pp and Pb-Pb as well as one of the most precise measurements so far of the hyper-triton lifetime.",
