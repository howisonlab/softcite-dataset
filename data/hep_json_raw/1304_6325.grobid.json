Several angular observables are measured in bins of the dimuon invariant mass squared, q 2 . A first measurement of the zero-crossing point of the forward-backward asymmetry of the dimuon system is also presented. The zero-crossing point is measured to be q 2 0 = 4.9 \u00b1 0.9 GeV 2 /c 4 , where the uncertainty is the sum of statistical and systematic uncertainties. The results are consistent with the Standard Model predictions.",

The B 0 \u2192 K * 0 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 decay is self-tagging through the charge of the kaon and so there is some freedom in the choice of the angular basis that is used to describe the decay. In this paper, the angle \u03b8 is defined as the angle between the direction of the \u00b5 + (\u00b5 \u2212 ) and the direction opposite that of the B 0 (B 0 ) in the dimuon rest frame. The angle \u03b8 K is defined as the angle between the direction of the kaon and the direction of opposite that of the B 0 (B 0 ) in in the K * 0 (K * 0 ) rest frame. The angle \u03c6 is the angle between the plane containing the \u00b5 + and \u00b5 \u2212 and the plane containing the kaon and pion from the K * 0 (K * 0 ) in the B 0 (B 0 ) rest frame. The basis is designed such that the angular definition for the B 0 decay is a CP transformation of that for the B 0 decay. This basis differs from some that appear in the literature. A graphical representation, and a more detailed description, of the angular basis is given in appendix A.",

A dipole magnet with a bending power of 4 Tm and a large area tracking detector provide momentum resolution ranging from 0.4% for tracks with a momentum of 5 GeV/c to 0.6% for a momentum of 100 GeV/c. A silicon microstrip detector, located around the pp interaction region, provides excellent separation of B meson decay vertices from the primary pp interaction and impact parameter resolution of 20 \u00b5m for tracks with high transverse momentum (p T ). Two ringimaging Cherenkov (RICH) detectors [11] provide kaon-pion separation in the momentum range 2 \u2212 100 GeV/c. Muons are identified based on hits created in a system of multiwire proportional chambers interleaved with layers of iron. The LHCb trigger [12] comprises a hardware trigger and a two-stage software trigger that performs a full event reconstruction.",

The signal shape is taken from a fit to the B 0 \u2192 K * 0 J/\u03c8 control sample and is parameterised by the sum of two Crystal Ball [23] functions that differ only by the width of the Gaussian component. The combinatorial background is described by an exponential distribution. The decay B 0 s \u2192 K * 0 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 , which forms a peaking background, is assumed to have a shape identical to that of the B 0 \u2192 K * 0 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 signal, but shifted in mass by the B 0 s \u2212 B 0 mass difference [24].

            "text": "In summary, using a data sample corresponding to 1.0 fb \u22121 of integrated luminosity, collected by the LHCb experiment in 2011, the differential branching fraction, dB/dq 2 , of the decay B 0 \u2192 K * 0 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 has been measured in bins of q 2 . Measurements of the angular observables, A FB (A Re T ), F L , S 3 (A 2 T ) and A 9 have also been performed in the same q 2 bins. The complete set of results obtained in this paper are provided in tables 1 and 2. These are the most precise measurements of dB/dq 2 and the angular observables to date. All of the observables are consistent with SM expectations and together put stringent constraints on the contributions from new particles to b \u2192 s flavour changing neutral current processes. A bin-by-bin comparison of the reduced angular distribution with the SM hypothesis indicates an excellent agreement with p-values between 18 and 72%.",

In order to exploit the interference and determine FS it is assumed that the phase difference between the two left-handed amplitudes is the same as the difference between the two right-handed amplitudes, as expected from the expression for the amplitudes in refs.[41,42].",
