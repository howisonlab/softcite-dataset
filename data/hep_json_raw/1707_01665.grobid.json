            "text": "The measurement of CP -violation observables in the decays B 0 \u2192 K 0 S \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and B 0 \u2192 K 0 S K + K \u2212 , which are dominated by b \u2192 qqs (q = u, d, s) loop transitions, are of great theoretical interest. 1 In particular, the mixing-induced CP asymmetries in these decays are predicted by the Standard Model (SM) Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa mechanism [1,2] to be approximately equal to those governed by b \u2192 ccs transitions, such as B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8 K 0 S . Within the SM the weak phase measurements in b \u2192 qqs decays are expected to deviate from the values determined in b \u2192 ccs decays but for certain contributions to these decays, such as B 0 \u2192 \u03c6K 0 S and B 0 \u2192 \u03c1 0 K 0 S , this deviation is either expected to be small or can be controlled using flavour symmetries [3][4][5]. The existence of new particles predicted in several extensions of the SM could introduce additional weak phases that contribute along with the SM mixing phase to the amplitudes of these loop-dominated charmless decays, JHEP11(2017)027 potentially leading to much greater deviations from the b \u2192 ccs values [6][7][8]. The mixinginduced CP -violating phase can be measured by means of a flavour-tagged time-dependent analysis of the three-body Dalitz plot of these decays [9][10][11][12]. The current experimental measurements of this phase in b \u2192 qqs decays [13] show a generally good agreement with the results for the weak phase \u03b2 from b \u2192 ccs decays for each of the CP eigenstates studied. The experimental uncertainties are, however, currently rather larger than the size of the expected deviations, both in the SM and beyond-the-SM scenarios, and so there is a need for more precise measurements of these quantities. A similar determination of the mixing-induced CP -violating phase in the B 0 s system is possible with, among others, the B 0 s \u2192 K 0 S K \u00b1 \u03c0 \u2213 decays [14]. It is also possible to determine the CKM angle \u03b3 by combining information from several B \u2192 Khh decays, using either the methods originally proposed in refs. [15,16] and recently developed further in ref. [17], or those proposed in refs. [18][19][20]. The existing experimental results, which come from the BaBar collaboration [21,22], demonstrate the feasibility of the measurement, albeit with large statistical uncertainties. The decay B 0 s \u2192 K 0 S \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 is dominated by tree-level processes and as such is of particular interest for this effort, with the potential to yield a theoretically clean determination of \u03b3 [23].",

Comparison of the different approaches with the experimental data will allow further refinement of the theoretical models, which in turn will yield improved predictions of branching fractions and CP asymmetries of these and many other charmless decay modes. In addition, these results can be used to test the level of breaking of the flavour symmetries: isospin, U-spin and SU (3), see for example ref. [30].",

Most recently, a search for the three B 0 s decays was reported by the LHCb experiment using the 1 fb \u22121 data sample recorded in 2011 [34]. While first observations were made for the B 0 s \u2192 K 0 S \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and B 0 s \u2192 K 0 S K \u00b1 \u03c0 \u2213 modes, no evidence for the decay B 0 s \u2192 K 0 S K + K \u2212 was found. In this work, all the aforementioned charmless three-body decays of the B 0 and B 0 s mesons are studied using the pp collision data recorded by the LHCb detector, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1.0 fb \u22121 at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV in 2011 and 2.0 fb \u22121 at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV in 2012. This sample is three times larger than that used in ref. [34]. The measurements of the time-integrated branching fractions [35] relative to that of B 0 \u2192 K 0 S \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 are presented. The notation B B 0 \u2192 K 0 S K \u00b1 \u03c0 \u2213 is used throughout the document to indicate the sum of the branching fractions B B 0 \u2192 K 0 S K + \u03c0 \u2212 and B B 0 \u2192 K 0 S K \u2212 \u03c0 + , and similarly for the corresponding B 0 s decays.",

At the hardware trigger stage, events are required to have a muon with high p T or a hadron, photon or electron with high transverse energy in the calorimeters. The software trigger requires a two-, three-or four-track secondary vertex with a significant displacement from all primary pp interaction vertices. At least one charged particle must have transverse momentum p T > 1.7 (1.6) GeV/c in the 2011 (2012) data and be inconsistent with originating from a PV. A multivariate algorithm [47] is used for the identification of secondary vertices consistent with the decay of a b hadron.
