            "text": "Even though the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon a \u00b5 is one of the most precisely known observables in particle physics, there is a long standing discrepancy between the direct measurement [1] and the Standard Model (SM) prediction [2]. Currently, the deviation is at the level of three to four standard deviations, which is of interest, as it might indicate contributions of New Physics. Thus, new measurements of a \u00b5 are carried out at Fermilab [3] and are planned at J-PARC [4] with the goal to improve the accuracy by a factor of four. Similar improvements are necessary for the SM prediction. The prediction is dominated by quantum electrodynamics, but also has contributions from weak and strong interactions. Due to the asymptotic freedom of the strong interaction, its contributions to a \u00b5 cannot be calculated perturbatively. As a consequence, the SM uncertainties are completely dominated by the uncertainties of the hadronic contributions. These can be separated into two parts, the contribution of the hadronic vacuum polarization (HVP) and the contribution of hadronic Light-by-Light scattering (HLbL). The former has the largest contribution to the absolute value, and the latter has the largest relative uncertainty. Recently, data-driven approaches based on dispersion theory are developed and used to systematically improve the SM calculations of the hadronic contributions. New and more precise measurements of related processes allow to pin down the uncertainties in a reliable way. The experimental inputs for the data-driven approaches to both hadronic contributions are measured at the BESIII experiment.",

Radiating off a photon from the initial state reduces the effective centerof-mass energy available for producing the hadronic system. The radiative process is related to the non-radiative production by the radiator function [11], which describes the probability to emit a photon carrying a certain fraction of \u221a s at a certain angle \u03b8 \u03b3 . This approach allows to measure hadronic cross sections at BESIII down to the hadronic threshold \u221a s = 2m \u03c0 . The angular distribution of the emitted ISR photons calls for two complementary analysis schemes. The majority of the photons is emitted at small scattering angles along the beam axis. Their direct detection is impossible. By measuring the produced hadronic system, the photon momentum can be reconstructed from energy and momentum conservation. Since the hadronic system is boosted oppositely to the ISR photon, a threshold on the mass of the produced system exists below which the particles also escape detection. At BESIII this threshold is at approximately 1 GeV. Final states above this threshold can be reconstructed with high statistics and small background contamination. For the second analysis scheme, the detection of the ISR photon is required. Here, the differential cross section of the radiative process is smaller, however, acceptance is given from the hadronic threshold. At larger hadronic masses the background contamination increases, since coincidental neutral signals are more likely to be mistaken for low energetic ISR photons.",

Based on 2.9 fb \u22121 of data taken at \u221a s = 3.773 GeV, pion masses between 600 MeV and 900 MeV [12] were studied. The mass range contains the pole of the \u03c1 resonance and makes up for approximately 70% of the HVP contribution to a \u00b5 . A high precision measurement is therefore inevitable. The dominating background contribution in this analysis is due to radiative muon pair production. Since conventional means of particle identification could not sufficiently separate pions from muons, an artificial neural network is trained and used. Careful evaluation and correction of all systematics allows for a sub-percent accuracy of the final result. The dominating uncertainties come from the normalization to the luminosity and the radiator function. In the alternative normalization to the muon yield these uncertainties cancel, however, due to the small muon yield in the data sample the result becomes statistically limited. Though comparison of the form factor with previous measurements suggests some tensions, the evaluation of the dispersion integral for a HVP \u00b5 is in good agreement with the recent combination of the KLOE results [13]. In view of more recently acquired data sets and the findings of Ref. [14] a new evaluation of the pion form factor has been started at BESIII, also taking into account additional mass ranges below and above the \u03c1 peak. The current result is included in the recent global evaluations of a HVP \u00b5 [2,15]. Both ISR analysis schemes are used to measure the cross sections of higher pion multiplicities in e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b3 ISR \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 and e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b3 ISR \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 . When the photon is detected, the events are subjected to a kinematic fit of the full final state, constrained by energy and momentum conservation and the \u03c0 0 rest masses of the photon pairs. Background can be sufficiently suppressed by rejecting events in which the combination of the ISR photon candidate with any other photon in the event has an invariant mass close to the \u03c0 0 mass. When the ISR photon remains undetected, the photon momentum is reconstructed by the kinematic fit. By requiring the photon to be collinear with the beam axis, background events are rejected. The dominating background contribution is the production of the next higher pion multiplicity with neutral pions, where one of the decay photons is mistaken for an ISR photon. The final result is calculated as the error weighted mean of both analysis schemes.",

Two-photon scattering allows for the direct production of (pseudo-)scalar and tensor states at e + e \u2212 machines. The cross section is suppressed with respect to annihilation, but it increases with the square of the logarithm of \u221a s. More importantly, it is directly proportional to the square of the TFF. Since the TFF decreases with increasing virtuality of the photons, it is difficult to investigate the TFF for two arbitrary virtualities at the current BESIII detector. However, the investigation of the momentum dependence is feasible when one of the photons is quasi-real. This is achieved by measuring the mesons in the final state and one of the scattered leptons, while the second lepton is reconstructed from energy and momentum conservation. By requiring its scattering angle to be small, the exchange of a quasi-real photon is selected. Figure 1.

            "text": "Using this approach, the TFF of the \u03c0 0 is investigated. Selecting events with one lepton and two photons in the final state causes a dominating background contribution by radiative Bhabha scattering. It can be effectively suppressed by a condition on the helicity angle of the photons from a pion candidate. A condition adapted from the BaBar measurement [23] of this TFF designed to suppress radiative effects in two-photon collision events further reduces background contributions due to wrongly reconstructed hadronic final states from annihilation events. Remaining background contributions are subtracted bin-by-bin in order to determine the event yield as a function of momentum transfer. Normalizing it to the reconstruction efficiency and luminosity of the data results in the differential cross section. The TFF |F \u03c0 0 \u03b3 * \u03b3 * (\u2212q 2 , 0)| 2 is finally determined by dividing out the point-like cross section using Monte Carlo distributions. The preliminary result is shown in Fig. 1 using the representation Q 2 \u2022 |F(\u2212q 2 , 0)|, which illustrates the asymptotic behavior of the TFF at large values of Q 2 . The evaluation of the contributions to the systematic uncertainties suggests a dominating contribution of the background subtraction procedure. The influence of radiative effects on the result is being evaluated based on the most recent calculations implemented in the Ekhara 3.0 event generator [24].",

            "text": "Another essential input to the data-driven approaches for a HLbL \u00b5 comes from the twophoton production of meson pairs. Most studies in the past were based on real photons [28][29][30]. Only recently the Belle Collaboration published the first results on the momentum dependence of the \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 and K s K s production [31,32], albeit at large momentum transfers. At BESIII the charged pion system is studied \u03b3\u03b3 * \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 . The analysis at BESIII follows the strategy successfully applied to the TFFs of single pseudoscalar mesons. Three charged tracks are detected and identified as a pair of pions and an e \u00b1 . The main background contributions stem from the two-photon production of muon pairs, which has a six-times larger cross section, and the radiative Bhabha scattering process, in which the photon couples to a \u03c1meson, decaying to two pions. Background from muon production is sufficiently understood from studies at LEP and well established MC generators [33,34]  As a first step towards TFF measurements at arbitrary virtualities first feasibility studies have been performed, detecting all final state particles in the detector volume. The first result of this kind of measurement was recently published by the BaBar Collaboration [35], albeit at large virtualities. Feasibility studies at BESIII show that based on the combination of the largest data sets, which correspond to an integrated luminosity of more than 10 fb \u22121 , the determination of the TFFs of \u03c0 0 , \u03b7 and \u03b7 is possible for momentum transfers of around (Q 2 1 , Q 2 2 ) \u2248 (1, 1) GeV 2 . The statistics is expected to be sufficient to validate the Q 2 dependence of the TFFs predicted by different hadronic models [27].",
