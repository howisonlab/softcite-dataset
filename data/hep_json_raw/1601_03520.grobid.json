They are produced in the early stage of the collisions and are expected to experience the whole collision evolution interacting with the medium constituents via both elastic and inelastic processes. The nuclear modification factor (R AA ) and the elliptic flow (v 2 ) are two of the main experimental observables that allow us to investigate the interaction strength of heavy quarks with the medium. The ALICE collaboration measured the production and elliptic flow of open heavyflavour hadrons via their hadronic and semi-leptonic decays to electrons at mid-rapidity and to muons at forward rapidity in Pb-Pb collisions. Recent results will be discussed, and model calculations including the interaction of heavy quarks with the hot, dense, and deconfined medium will be confronted with the data.",

In such collisions a deconfined state of quarks and gluons, the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP), is expected to be formed. Due to their large masses, heavy quarks, i.e. charm (c) and beauty (b) quarks, are produced at the initial stage of the collision, almost exclusively in hard partonic scattering processes. Therefore, they experience the full evolution of the system propagating through the hot and dense medium and loosing energy via radiative [2] and collisional [3] scattering processes. Heavy-flavour hadrons and their decay products are thus effective probes to study the properties of the medium created in heavy-ion collisions.",

The TAMU [9] model describes the measured D + s nuclear modification factor within uncertainties, and it also provides a reasonable description of non-strange D-meson R AA at low p T . Due to the QCD nature of parton energy loss, quarks are predicted to lose less energy than gluons (that have a larger colour coupling factor). In addition, the dead-cone effect [10] is expected to reduce the energy loss of massive quarks with respect to light quarks. Therefore, if we consider only energy-loss effect, a hierarchy in the R AA is expected to be observed when comparing the mostly gluon-originated light-flavour hadrons (e.g. pions) to D and to B mesons [5,11]: R AA (\u03c0) < R AA (D) < R AA (B). The measurement and comparison of these different medium probes provides a unique test of the colour-charge and mass dependence of parton energy loss. In the left panel of Fig. 2 the nuclear modification factor of prompt D mesons in the transverse momentum region 8 < p T < 16 GeV/c is shown as a function of centrality in comparison with the R AA (\u03c0). Less suppression is observed moving from central to semi-central collisions, since the medium formed in peripheral collisions should be less dense with respect to the one formed in a central collision. The D-meson R AA (D) is compatible with that of charged pions and charged particles within uncertainties [5,12,13,14]. The consistency between the two measurements is also described by a model including mass-dependent energy loss, different shape of the parton p T spectra and different parton fragmentation functions [15]. The comparison of the centrality dependence of the R AA of D mesons and of J/\u03a8 from B-hadron decays (measured by the CMS collaboration [16]) is displayed in the right panel of Fig. 2. It shows an indication for a stronger suppression for charm than for beauty at high p T in central Pb-Pb collisions consistent with the expectation of R AA (D) < R AA (B). The two measurements are described by the predictions based on a pQCD model including mass-dependent radiative and collisional energy loss [15]. In this model the difference in the R AA of charm and beauty mesons is mainly due to the mass dependence of quark energy loss, as demonstrated by the curve in which the non-prompt J/\u03a8 R AA is calculated assuming that b quarks suffer the same energy loss as c quarks.",
