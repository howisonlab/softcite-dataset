The performance of the algorithms is evaluated in the simulation and the efficiency with which these algorithms identify jets containing b-hadrons is measured in collision data. The measurement uses a likelihood-based method in a sample highly enriched in tt events. The topology of the t \u2192 W b decays is exploited to simultaneously measure both the jet flavour composition of the sample and the efficiency in a transverse momentum range from 20 to 600 GeV. The efficiency measurement is subsequently compared with that predicted by the simulation. The data used in this measurement, corresponding to a total integrated luminosity of 80.5 fb \u22121 , were collected in proton-proton collisions during the years 2015-2017 at a centre-of-mass energy \u221a s = 13 TeV. By simultaneously extracting both the efficiency and jet flavour composition, this measurement significantly improves the precision compared to previous results, with uncertainties ranging from 1 to 8% depending on the jet transverse momentum.",

            "text": "The ATLAS Collaboration uses various algorithms to identify b-jets [5], referred to as b-tagging algorithms, when analysing data recorded during Run 2 of the LHC (2015-2018). These algorithms exploit the long lifetime, high mass and high decay multiplicity of b-hadrons as well as the properties of the b-quark fragmentation. Given a lifetime of the order of 1.5 ps (< c\u03c4 >\u2248 450 \u00b5m), measurable b-hadrons have a significant mean flight length, < l >= \u03b2\u03b3 c\u03c4 , in the detector before decaying, generally leading to at least one vertex displaced from the hard-scatter collision point. The strategy developed by the ATLAS Collaboration is based on a two-stage approach. Firstly, low-level algorithms reconstruct the characteristic features of the b-jets via two complementary approaches, one that uses the individual properties of charged-particle tracks, later referred to as tracks, associated with a hadronic jet, and a second which combines the tracks to explicitly reconstruct displaced vertices. These algorithms, first introduced during Run 1 [5], have been improved and retuned for Run 2. Secondly, in order to maximise the b-tagging performance, the results of the low-level b-tagging algorithms are combined in high-level algorithms consisting of multivariate classifiers. The performance of a b-tagging algorithm is characterised by the probability of tagging a b-jet (b-jet tagging efficiency, \u03b5 b ) and the probability of mistakenly identifying a c-jet or a light-flavour jet as a b-jet, labelled \u03b5 c (\u03b5 l ). In this paper, the performance of the algorithms is quantified in terms of c-jet and light-flavour jet rejections, defined as 1/\u03b5 c and 1/\u03b5 l , respectively.",

In this paper, the measurement of the b-jet tagging efficiency of the highlevel b-tagging algorithms used in proton-proton ( pp) collision data recorded during Run 2 of the LHC at \u221a s = 13 TeV is presented. The corresponding measurements for c-jets and light-flavour jets, used in the measurement of the b-jet tagging efficiency to correct the simulation such that the overall tagging efficiency of c-jets and light-flavour jets match that of the data, are described elsewhere [7,8]. The production of tt pairs at the LHC provides an abundant source of b-jets by virtue of the high cross-section and the t \u2192 W b branching ratio being close to 100%. A very pure sample of tt events is selected by requiring that both W bosons decay leptonically, referred to as dileptonic tt decays in the following. A combinatorial likelihood approach is used to measure the b-jet tagging efficiency of the high-level b-tagging algorithms as a function of the jet transverse momentum ( p T ). This version of the analysis builds upon the approach used previously by the ATLAS Collaboration [6], extending the method to derive additional constraints on the flavour composition of the sample, which reduces the uncertainties by up to a factor of two relative to previous publication.",

For a fixed b-jet efficiency, the incorporation of the IBL improves the light-flavour jet rejection of the btagging algorithms by up to a factor of four [10]. The silicon pixel detector is followed by a silicon microstrip tracker (SCT) that typically provides eight measurements from four strip double layers. These silicon detectors are complemented by a transition radiation tracker (TRT), which enables radially extended track reconstruction up to the pseudorapidity 1 |\u03b7| = 2.0. The TRT also provides electron identification information based on the fraction of hits (typically 33 in the barrel and up to an average of 38 in the endcaps) above a higher energy-deposit threshold corresponding to transition radiation.

            "text": "Tracks are reconstructed in the ID [12]. The b-tagging algorithms only consider tracks with p T larger than 500 MeV, with further selection criteria applied to reject fake and poorly measured tracks [13]. The combined efficiency of the track reconstruction and selection criteria, evaluated by using minimum-bias simulated events (in which more than 98% of charged-particles are pions), ranges from 91% in the central (|\u03b7| < 0.1) region to 73% in the forward (2.3 \u2264 |\u03b7| < 2.5) region of the detector. Additional selections on reconstructed tracks are applied in the low-level b-tagging algorithms described in Sect. 4.2 to specifically select b-and c-hadron decay track candidates and improve the rejection of tracks originating from pile-up. 2 Primary vertex (PV) reconstruction [14,15] on an event-byevent basis is particularly important for b-tagging since it defines the reference point from which track and vertex displacements are computed. A longitudinal vertex position resolution of about 30 \u00b5m is achieved for events with a high multiplicity of reconstructed tracks, while the transverse resolution ranges from 10 to 12 \u00b5m, depending on the LHC running conditions that determine the beam spot size. At least one PV is required in each event, with the PV that has the highest sum of squared transverse momenta of contributing tracks selected as the primary interaction point. Displaced charged-particle tracks originating from b-hadron decays can then be selected by requiring large transverse and longitudinal impact parameters, IP r \u03c6 = |d 0 | and IP z = |z 0 sin \u03b8 |, respectively, where d 0 (z 0 ) represents the transverse (longitudinal) perigee parameter defined at the point of the closest approach of the trajectory to the z-axis [16]. Upper limits on the values of these parameters are used to reduce the contamination from pile-up, secondary and fake tracks. Hadronic jets are built from topological clusters of energy in the calorimeter [17], calibrated to the electromagnetic scale, using the anti-k t algorithm with radius parameter R = 0.4 [18]. Jet transverse momenta are further corrected to the corresponding particle-level jet p T , based on the simulation [19]. Remaining differences between data and simulated events are evaluated and corrected for using in situ techniques, which exploit the transverse momentum balance between a jet and a reference object such as a photon, Z boson, or multi-jet system in data. After these calibrations, all jets in the event with p T \u2265 20 GeV and |\u03b7| < 4.5 must satisfy a set of loose jet-quality requirements [20], else the event is discarded. These requirements are designed to reject fake jets originating from sporadic bursts, large coherent noise or isolated pathological cells in the calorimeter system, hardware issues, beam-induced background or cosmicray muons. Jets with p T < 20 GeV or |\u03b7| \u2265 2.5 are then discarded. In order to reduce the number of jets with large energy fractions from pile-up collision vertices, the Jet Vertex Tagger (JVT) algorithm is used [21]. The JVT procedure builds a multivariate discriminant for each jet within |\u03b7| < 2.5 based on the ID tracks ghost-associated with the jet [22]; in particular, jets with a large fraction of high-momentum tracks from pile-up vertices are less likely to pass the JVT requirement. The rate of pile-up jets with p T \u2265 120 GeV is sufficiently small that the JVT requirement is removed above this threshold. The JVT efficiency for jets originating from the hard pp scattering is 92% in the simulation. Scale factors of order unity are applied to account for efficiency differences relative to collision data. Track-jet matching is performed using the angular separation R between the track momenta, defined at the perigee, and the jet axis, defined as the vectorial sum of the four-momenta of the clusters associated with the jet. Given that the decay products from higherp T b-hadrons are more collimated, the R requirement varies as a function of jet p T , being wider for lowp T jets (0.45 for jet p T = 20 GeV) and narrower for highp T jets (0.26 for jet p T = 150 GeV). If more than one jet fulfils the matching criteria, the closest jet is preferred. The jet axis is also used to assign signed impact parameters to tracks, where the sign is defined as positive if the track intersects the jet axis in the transverse plane in front of the primary vertex, and as negative if the intersection lies behind the primary vertex. Jet flavour labels are attributed to the jets in the simulation.",

A first approach, implemented in the IP2D and IP3D algorithms [23] and described in Sect. 4.2.1, is inclusive and based on exploiting the large impact parameters of the tracks originating from the b-hadron decay. The second approach explicitly reconstructs displaced vertices. The SV1 algorithm [24], discussed in Sect. 4.2.2, attempts to reconstruct an inclusive secondary vertex, while the JetFitter algorithm [25], presented in Sect. 4.2.3, aims to reconstruct the full b-to c-hadron decay chain. These algorithms, first introduced during Run 1 [5], benefit from improvements and a new tuning for Run 2. To maximise the b-tagging performance, low-level algorithm results are combined using multivariate classifiers. To this end, two high-level tagging algorithms have been developed. The first one, MV2 [23], is based on a boosted decision tree (BDT) discriminant, while the second one, DL1 [23], is based on a deep feed-forward neural network (NN). These two algorithms are presented in Sects. 4.3.1 and 4.3.2, respectively.",

Only tt decays with at least one lepton from a subsequent W -boson decay are considered in order to ensure a sufficiently large fraction of c-jets in the event whilst maintaining a jet multiplicity profile similar to that in most analyses. A dedicated sample of Z decaying into hadronic jet pairs is included to optimise the b-tagging performance at high jet p T . The cross-section of the hard-scattering process is modified by applying an event-by-event weighting factor to broaden the natural width of the resonance and widen the transverse momentum dis-tribution of the jets produced in the hadronic decays up to a jet p T of 1.5 TeV. The branching fractions of the decays are set to be one-third each for the bb, cc and light-flavour quark pairs to give a p T spectrum uniformly populated by jets of all flavours. The hybrid sample is obtained by selecting b-jets from tt events if the corresponding b-hadron p T is below 250 GeV and from the Z sample if above, with a similar strategy applied for c-jets and light-flavour jets. More details about the production of the tt simulated sample, referred to as the baseline tt sample in the following, and the Z simulated sample are given in Sect. 5. Events with at least one jet are selected, excluding the jets overlapping with a generatorlevel electron originating from a W -or Z -boson decay.",

The IP2D tagger makes use of the signed transverse impact parameter significance of tracks to construct a discriminating variable, whereas IP3D uses both the track signed transverse and the longitudinal impact parameter significance in a two-dimensional template to account for their correlation. Probability density functions (pdf) obtained from reference histograms of the signed transverse and longitudinal impact parameter significances of tracks associated with b-jets, c-jets and light-flavour jets are derived from MC simulation. The pdfs are computed in exclusive categories that depend on the hit pattern of the tracks to increase the discriminating power. The pdfs are used to calculate ratios of the b-jet, c-jet and light-flavour jet probabilities on a per-track basis. Log-likelihood ratio (LLR) discriminants are then defined as the sum of the per-track probability ratios for each jet-flavour hypothesis, e.g. N i=1 log ( p b / p u ) for the b-jet and light-flavour jet hypotheses, where N is the number of tracks associated with the jet and p b ( p u ) is the template pdf for the b-jet (light-flavour jet) hypothesis. The flavour probabilities of the different tracks contributing to the sum are assumed to be independent of each other. In addition to the LLR separating b-jets from light-flavour jets, two extra LLR functions are defined to separate b-jets from c-jets and c-jets from light-flavour jets, respectively. These three likelihood discriminants for both the IP2D and IP3D algorithms are used as inputs to the high-level taggers.",

The fake-vertex rate is also better controlled by limiting the algorithm to only consider the 25 highestp T tracks in the jets, which preserves all reconstructed tracks from b-hadron decays, whilst limiting the influence of additional tracks in the jet. The selection of two-track vertex candidates prior to the \u03c7 2 -fit was also reoptimised. Extra candidate-cleaning requirements were introduced to further reduce the number of fake vertices and material interactions, such as the rejection of two-track vertex candidates with an invariant mass greater than 6 GeV, which are not likely to originate from b-and chadron decays. Eight discriminating variables, including the number of tracks associated with the SV1 vertex, the invariant mass of the secondary vertex, its energy fraction (defined as the total energy of all the tracks associated with the secondary vertex divided by the energy of all the tracks associated with the jet), and the three-dimensional decay length significance are used as inputs to the high-level taggers.

The b-tagging performance of the JetFitter algorithm is evaluated using a LLR discriminant based on likelihood functions combining pdfs extracted from some of the JetFitter output variables (vertex mass, energy fraction and decay length significance) and parameterised for each of the three jet flavours.",

            "text": "The MV2 algorithm [23] consists of a boosted decision tree (BDT) algorithm that combines the outputs of the lowlevel tagging algorithms described in Sect. 4.2 and listed in Table 1. The BDT algorithm is trained using the ROOT Toolkit for Multivariate Data Analysis (TMVA) [27] on the hybrid tt + Z sample. The kinematic properties of the jets, namely p T and |\u03b7|, are included in the training in order to take advantage of the correlations with the other input variables. However, to avoid differences in the kinematic distributions of signal (b-jets) and background (c-jets and lightflavour jets) being used to discriminate between the different jet flavours, the b-jets and c-jets are reweighted in p T and |\u03b7| to match the spectrum of the light-flavour jets. No kinematic reweighting is applied at the evaluation stage of the multivariate classifier. For training, the c-jet fraction in the background sample is set to 7%, with the remainder com- posed of light-flavour jets. This allows the charm rejection to be enhanced whilst preserving a high light-flavour jet rejection. The BDT training hyperparameters of the MV2 tagging algorithm are listed in Table 2. They have been optimised to provide the best separation power between the signal and the background. The output discriminant of the MV2 algorithm for b-jets, c-jets and light-flavour jets evaluated with the baseline tt simulated events are shown in Fig. 1a.",

The DL1 NN has a multidimensional output corresponding to the probabilities for a jet to be a b-jet, a c- jet or a light-flavour jet. The topology of the output consists of a mixture of fully connected hidden and Maxout layers [31]. The input variables to DL1 consist of those used for the MV2 algorithm with the addition of the JetFitter c-tagging  variables listed in Table 1. The latter relate to the dedicated properties of the secondary and tertiary vertices (distance to the primary vertex, invariant mass and number of tracks, energy, energy fraction, and rapidity of the tracks associated with the secondary and tertiary vertices). A jet p T and |\u03b7| reweighting similar to the one used for MV2 is performed. The DL1 algorithm parameters, listed in Table 3, include the architecture of the NN, the number of training epochs, the learning rates and training batch size. All of these are optimised in order to maximise the b-tagging performance. Batch normalisation [32] is added by default since it is found to improve the performance. Training with multiple output nodes offers additional flexibility when constructing the final output discriminant by combining the b-jet, c-jet and light-flavour jet probabilities. Since all flavours are treated equally during training, the trained network can be used for both b-jet and c-jet tagging. In addition, the use of a multi-class network architecture pro-vides the DL1 algorithm with a smaller memory footprint than BDT-based algorithms. The final DL1 b-tagging discriminant is defined as:",

The selections used to define the single-cut OPs of the MV2 and the DL1 algorithms, as well as the corresponding c-jet, \u03c4 -jet and lightflavour jet rejections, are shown in Table 4. The MV2 and the DL1 discriminant distributions are also divided into five 'pseudo-continuous' bins, (O k ) k=1... 5 , delimited by the selections used to define the b-jet tagging single-cut OPs for 85%, 77%, 70% and 60% efficiency, and bounded   Fig. 2 for the various low-and high-level b-tagging algorithms. This demonstrates the advantage of combining the information provided by the low-level taggers, where improvements in the lightflavour jet and c-jet rejections by factors of around 10 and 2.5, respectively, are observed at the b = 70% single-cut OP of the high-level algorithms compared to low-level algorithms. This figure also illustrates the different b-jet tagging efficiency range accessible with each low-level algorithm and thereby their complementarity in the multivariate combinations, with the performance of the DL1 and MV2 discriminants found to be similar. The two algorithms tag a highly correlated sample of b-jets, where the relative fraction of jet exclusively tagged by each algorithm is around 3% at the \u03b5 b = 70% single-cut OP.

The fraction of \u03c4 -jets is predicted to be negligible. In order to create bb, bl, lb and ll-enriched regions in the selected sample, each of the two leptons is paired with a jet in an exclusive way to determine whether they originate from the same top-quark decay. The pairing is performed such that it minimises (m 2 j1, i + m 2 j2, j ), where j1 ( j2) is the highestp T (second highestp T ) jet, i, j are the two leptons and m j1, (m j2, ) is the invariant mass of the system including the highest (second highest) p T jet and its associated lepton. Choosing the pairing that mimimises this quantity relies on the fact that if the pairs of objects are from the same original particles then they are likely to have similar masses. Using the minimum of squared masses penalises asymmetric pairings with one high-mass lepton-jet pair, as well as combinations including two very high invariant masses, which are unlikely for those arising from top-quark decay. Events are required to have m j1, \u2265 20 GeV and m j2, \u2265 20 GeV in order to avoid configurations in which a soft jet and a soft lepton are close to each other, which are not well described by the sim-ulation. The event classification based on these variables is described in more detail in the next section.",

Single top production in association with a W boson accounts for 8% of the events, with about 30% of these events containing two selected b-jets. Diboson and Z +jet production represent respectively about 5% and 2% of the selected events, 85% of these events being ll events. Events originating from W +jets production are negligible (< 0.1%). The main source of non-b-jets therefore originates from tt bl or lb events, i.e. dileptonic tt events with a highp T lightflavour jet originating from ISR or FSR. Figure 3 shows the level of agreement between data and simulation as a function of the p T and \u03b7 of the selected jets as well as the expected fraction of tt events. The overall level of agreement between data and simulation is fairly good, although some mismodelling is present at high jet p T , possibly related to the modelling of the top-quark p T [57], which motivates the extraction of the b-jet tagging efficiency in jet p T bins. The distribution of the discriminant of the MV2 algorithm for events passing the selection is shown in Fig. 4. Generally, good modelling is observed, indicating similar b-jet tagging efficiencies in data and simulation.

Simulated events are classified according to the flavour composition of the two jets, where the first term in each legend entry represents the flavour of the jet which is plotted (b or l) and the following term in parenthesis represents the flavour composition of the event (bb, bl + lb or ll).

The uncertainties originating from parton distribution functions (PDF) are quantified following the PDF4LHC recommendations [60]. An additional source of uncertainty originates from the mismodelling of the interference between single top W t and tt production. It is evaluated by switching the nominal single-top simulation sample, based on the 'diagram removal' scheme, to the one based on the 'diagram subtraction' scheme [45]. The final tt modelling uncertainty reaches 3% (2%) for jet p T < 30 GeV (30 \u2264 p T < 40 GeV) and about 1% for p T \u2265 40 GeV. It is dominated at low p T by PDF and ISR/FSR variations whereas at higher p T the choice of parton shower and hadronisation model is the dominant contribution. The single-top uncertainty reaches about 3% for jet p T < 30 GeV due to the parton shower and hadronisation model variation, and 1% for jet p T \u2265 250 GeV, where the uncertainty in the interference with tt events is the dominant contribution. It is below 1% elsewhere. The uncertainties associated with the modelling of top-quark events are reduced by up to a factor of two relative to the previous ATLAS analysis [6] due to the new b-jet tagging efficiency extraction method, which allows the bb event yield to be determined at a precision of a few percent in each p T,1 , p T,2 bin.",

This is due to the tight muon identification and isolation criteria applied. The number of events with a selected electron not originating from a Z -or W -boson decay passing the event selection (1NPel, for 1 non-prompt electron) is also predicted by the simulation to be very small but one order of magnitude higher, reaching about 0.3% of the total event yield after selection. An uncertainty in this yield is derived by comparing the number of data and MC events in an alternative region defined by requiring two same-sign (SS) leptons instead of opposite-sign (OS). The SS region is predicted by the simulation to have a composition that is 12% 1NPel events, with the remaining 88% of the sample coming from non-1NPel events, which is dominated by diboson production. This is estimated from simulation and subtracted from the data. The remaining data events are then compared with MC predictions in bins of electron p T . The data-to-simulation ratio ranges from values close to 3 for p T < 120 GeV to values close to 1 for p T \u2265 300 GeV. These values are used as simulation-to-data scale factors to correct the yield of simulated 1NPel events in the OS region in order to estimate an uncertainty in the fakelepton modelling. The b-jet tagging efficiency measurement is then repeated with these scale factors applied and com- pared with the nominal measurement. Differences of about 1% to 2% for jet p T < 40 GeV and negligible elsewhere are observed and accounted for as an additional systematic uncertainty.",

Since there are currently not many b-jets in data for jet p T above 400 GeV in di-lepton tt events, an alternative assessment of the uncertainty in the b-jet tagging efficiency for jet p T in this range is developed to extend the single cut OP calibration to the entire jet p T range inspected by physics analyses in ATLAS. Underlying quantities that are known to affect the b-tagging performance are varied in the simulation one by one and the b-jet tagging efficiency is recomputed in each case. The difference from the b-jet tagging efficiency obtained in the nominal simulation is then taken as an additional systematic uncertainty. Four distinct sets of variables, related to the reconstruction of tracks, of jets, the modelling of the b-hadrons and the interaction of long-lived b-hadrons with the detector material, are considered. Among the uncertainties related to the reconstruction of tracks, the ones that are found to most affect the b-tagging performance are those related to the track impact-parameter resolution, the fraction of fake tracks, the description of the detector material, and the track multiplicity per jet. The uncertainty in the impact-parameter resolution includes the effects of alignment, dead modules and additional material not accurately modelled in the simulation. The uncertainty is derived from several event topologies, including dijet events where effects due to tracking in dense environments, such as in the cores of high-energy jets, are included [12]. No dedicated studies of samples enriched in high-energy b-jets, where collimated tracks from displaced decay vertices conspire to create a challenging environment for the track reconstruction algorithm, are included at this stage. The effect of the parton shower simulation and b-quark fragmentation function is evaluated by comparing the b-jet tagging efficiency with the one obtained from the alternative tt event simulations described in Sect. 5. In standard ATLAS MC simulations, interactions with detector material are simulated only for the decay products of the b-hadron and not for the b-hadron itself. Given that about 5% of the b-hadrons within b-jets with jet p T = 150 GeV decay after the innermost pixel detector layer, differences in the b-jet tagging efficiency at high p T are expected. In order to evaluate the size of the effect, the Z sample described in Sect. 5 was enhanced to include the interaction of b-hadrons with the detector material, and the b-jet tagging efficiency derived from this sample is compared with the one obtained from the nominal Z sample.",

            "text": "These sources of uncertainties are found to have a similar impact on the b-jet tagging efficiency of the MV2 and DL1 taggers in the jet p T range 400 GeV to 1 TeV. In this jet p T regime, the modelling uncertainties are dominant, reaching 2% for p T \u223c 400 GeV and growing linearly to \u223c 4% at the TeV scale. The uncertainty due to the interaction with the detector material is also important and found to be \u223c 1% at p T \u223c 700 GeV, growing to \u223c 2% at \u223c 1 TeV. Other leading uncertainties include the jet energy scale and track impactparameter resolution uncertainties, reaching about 2.5% and 1% at \u223c 1 TeV, respectively. At the TeV scale, the impact of the extrapolation uncertainty is different for MV2 and DL1, due to the differing efficiency profile of the two b-taggers. The b-jet tagging efficiency of DL1 falls more steeply at high p T compared to that of MV2, which is approximately constant. This results in the jet energy scale uncertainty having a much larger impact for the DL1 tagger, due to the increased impact of the migration of jets between the p T bins. The simulation-to-data scale factor measured in the highest p T bin considered in the collision data analysis is extrapolated for p T \u2265 400 GeV. The mean value and uncertainties after smoothing at p T = 400 GeV are assumed to stay valid for higher jet p T . An extrapolation uncertainty is then constructed as the sum in quadrature of all the uncertainties described above, rescaled in proportion to their respective values in the highest p T bin of the data measurement, and added in quadrature to the pre-existing uncertainties. The result of the procedures of smoothing and extrapolating the single cut OP scale factors are shown in Fig. 12, where both the b-jet tagging efficiency as directly measured in data and its extrapolation are shown for the \u03b5 b = 70% single cut OP of the MV2 and DL1 taggers.",

Simulation-to-simulation scale factors are therefore derived to take into account differences in the b-jet tagging efficiency due to the usage of a different fragmentation model to that used to derive the simulation-to-data scale factors. The simulation-to-simulation scale factors are computed as ratios of b-jet tagging efficiencies in the same jet p T bins of the alternative and nominal tt samples. For b-jets, they range from 1 to 3% as a function of jet p T . These scale factors are used when the b-jet tagging efficiency simulationto-data scale factors are applied to a sample produced with a showering generator different from the one used for the nominal tt sample used in the denominator of the scale factor calculation.",

A method for reducing the total number of uncertainties while preserving the binby-bin correlations is provided for use in ATLAS physics analyses and is described in Ref. [6]. This is achieved by constructing the covariance matrix for each source of uncertainty and by summing these matrices together. Bin-by-bin correlations are kept as non-zero off-diagonal elements. As this equates to the total covariance matrix, which is symmetric and positive-definite, an eigenvector decomposition is performed. The resulting number of variations equals the number of jet p T bins and is further reduced where eigenvalue variations are shown to have a negligible impact on a result.",

A high-purity sample of dileptonic tt events is obtained by retaining events with exactly one muon, one electron and two hadronic jets. Events are classified according to the transverse momentum of each of the two jets as well as the jet-lepton invariant masses obtained when pairing exclusively each jet with the lepton most likely to originate from the same topquark decay. A combinatorial likelihood approach is then used to simultaneously extract the jet flavour composition of the sample and the b-jet tagging probabilities for jets in a transverse momentum range from 20 to 600 GeV, from which the b-jet tagging efficiencies for single cut OPs are obtained. Simulation-to-data scale factors are computed by comparing the efficiency measured in collision data with that observed in the simulation. The measured simulation-to-data scale factors are close to unity with a total uncertainty ranging from 1 to 8% for single cut OPs. The precision of the measurement is limited at low p T by the uncertainty in the jet energy scale, which is detector-related, and at high p T by the size of the dataset, which will grow in the future. It was previously limited by the modelling of top-quark pair production. Further procedures relating to the simulation-to-data scale factors are undertaken to correct for generator dependences, smooth the shape, extrapolate beyond the range of the data measurement, reduce the number of nuisance parameters and apply them in ATLAS analyses.",
