With two heavy constituent quarks, this baryon provides a unique system for testing quantum chromodynamics. The average mass of the \u039e ++ cc baryon from the two LHCb measurements now stands at 3621.24 \u00b1 0.65 (stat) \u00b1 0.31 (syst) MeV/c 2 and its lifetime is 0.256 +0.024 \u22120.022 (stat) \u00b1 0.014 (syst) ps [3], consistent with a weakly decaying state. However, many features of the \u039e ++ cc baryon remain unknown, including its spin and parity. Previously, signals of the singly charged \u039e + cc state were reported in the \u039b + c K \u2212 \u03c0 + and pD + K \u2212 final states by the SELEX collaboration [4,5]. The masses of the \u039e ++ cc and \u039e + cc ground states are expected to be approximately equal according to isospin symmetry [6]. Searches in different production environments at the FOCUS, BaBar, Belle and LHCb experiments have however not shown evidence for a \u039e + cc state with the properties reported by the SELEX collaboration [7][8][9][10].",

            "text": "To further understand the dynamics of weakly decaying doubly heavy baryons, it is of prime importance to pursue searches for additional decay modes of the \u039e ++ cc baryon. These decays may differ significantly from those of singly heavy hadrons due to interference effects between decay amplitudes of the two heavy quarks. From an experimental viewpoint, the decay \u039e ++ cc \u2192 D + (\u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + )pK \u2212 \u03c0 + is a suitable search channel, since the D + \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + trigger is proven to be very efficient at LHCb [11]. 1 The tree-level amplitudes of the inclusive decays of \u039e ++ cc \u2192 D + pK \u2212 \u03c0 + and \u039e ++ cc \u2192 \u039b + c K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + , as shown in figure 1, are comparable, which suggests that the branching fractions of these two modes could be similar. Theoretical calculations have been performed on pseudo-two-body decays of doubly-charmed baryons [12]. The \u039e ++ cc \u2192 D + pK \u2212 \u03c0 + decay could proceed as a pseudo-two-body decay if it decays via an excited \u03a3 + * state with a mass greater than 1572 MeV/c 2 , which would then decay to a pK \u2212 \u03c0 + final state. However, the properties of such \u03a3 + * decays are not well known [13]. The \u039e ++ cc \u2192 D + pK \u2212 \u03c0 + decay also has a energy release of 180 MeV, compared to 560 MeV for the \u039e ++ cc \u2192 \u039b + c K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + decay, which means it is expected to have a lower branching fraction because of the smaller available phase space.",

The detector includes a high-precision tracking system consisting of a silicon-strip vertex detector surrounding the pp interaction region [16], a large-area silicon-strip detector located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4 Tm, and three stations of silicon-strip detectors and straw drift tubes [17] placed downstream of the magnet. The tracking system provides a measurement of the momentum, p, of charged particles with a relative uncertainty that varies from 0.5% at low momentum to 1.0% at 200 GeV/c. The minimum distance of a track to a primary vertex (PV), the impact parameter (IP), is measured with a resolution of (15 + 29/p T ) \u00b5m, where p T is the component of the momentum transverse to the beam, in GeV/c. Charged hadrons are identified using two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors [18]. Photon, electron and hadron candidates are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad, pre-shower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter and a hadronic calorimeter. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers [19]. The trigger consists of a hardware stage, based on information from the calorimeter and muon systems, followed by a software stage, which applies a full event reconstruction. The online reconstruction incorporates near-real-time alignment and calibration of the detector [11]. The same alignment and calibration information is propagated to the offline reconstruction, ensuring consistent and high-quality information between the trigger and offline software. The identical performance of the online and offline reconstruction offers the opportunity to perform physics analyses directly using candidates reconstructed in the trigger [20]. The analysis described in this paper makes use of these features. Simulated \u039e ++ cc \u2192 D + pK \u2212 \u03c0 + decays are used to design the candidate selection and to calculate the efficiency of such a selection. The proton-proton interactions are generated using Pythia [21] with a specific LHCb configuration [23]. Genxicc v2.0 [24], the dedicated generator for doubly-heavy-baryon production at LHCb, is used to produce the signal. Decays of hadronic particles are described by EvtGen [25], in which final-state radiation is generated using Photos [26]. The interaction of the generated particles with the detector and their response are implemented using the Geant4 toolkit [27] as described in ref. [29]. The \u039e ++ cc \u2192 D + pK \u2212 \u03c0 + decays are generated with a \u039e ++ cc mass of 3621.40 MeV/c 2 and the decay products of \u039e ++ cc and D + hadrons are distributed uniformly in phase space.",

            "text": "The procedure to trigger, reconstruct and select candidates is designed to retain \u039e ++ cc signal and to suppress three primary sources of background: combinatorial background, which arises from random combination of tracks; misreconstructed charm or beauty hadron decays, which typically have displaced decay vertices; and combinations of a real D + meson with other tracks to form a fake \u039e ++ cc candidate. To better control systematic uncertainties, the selection of \u039e ++ cc \u2192 D + pK \u2212 \u03c0 + decays is also designed to be as similar as possible to that of the \u039e ++ cc \u2192 \u039b + c K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + normalisation channel, described in ref. [1]. The D + candidates are reconstructed in the final state K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + . At least one of the three tracks used to reconstruct the D + candidate must be selected by the inclusive software trigger, which requires that the track has p T > 250 MeV/c and \u03c7 2 IP > 4 with respect to any PV, where \u03c7 2 IP is defined as the difference in \u03c7 2 of a given PV reconstructed with and without the considered track. The D + candidate then must be reconstructed and accepted by a dedicated D + \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + selection algorithm in the software trigger. This algorithm applies several geometric and kinematic requirements; at least one of the three tracks must have p T > 1 GeV/c and \u03c7 2 IP > 50, at least two of the tracks must have p T > 0.4 GeV/c and \u03c7 2 IP > 10 and the scalar sum of the p T of the three tracks must be larger than 3 GeV/c. Furthermore, the D + candidate must have a good vertex-fit quality with \u03c7 2 /ndf < 6. The candidate must also point back to its associated PV, where the angle between its flight path and momentum vector should be less than 0.01 radians. The associated PV is that which best fits the flight direction of the reconstructed candidate. The D + vertex must also be displaced from this PV such that the estimated D + decay time is longer than 0.4 ps. Only candidates whose invariant mass is within \u00b180 MeV/c 2 of the known mass of the D + meson (1869.65 MeV/c 2 [13]) are retained. Finally, candidates are required to pass a MatrixNet classifier [11] within the software trigger, which has been trained on p T and vertex \u03c7 2 information prior to data taking. For events that pass the online trigger, the offline selection of D + candidates proceeds in a similar fashion to that used in the software trigger: three tracks are required to form a common vertex that is significantly displaced from the associated PV of the candidate and its combined invariant mass must be in the range [1847, 1891] MeV/c 2 . Particle identification (PID) requirements are imposed on all three tracks to suppress combinatorial background and misidentified charm decays. The \u039e ++ cc candidates are formed by combining a D + candidate with three more charged tracks, each with p T > 500 MeV/c and separately identified as a proton, kaon and pion with good track quality. The three tracks and the D + candidate are required to form a vertex in which each pairwise combination of the four particles is required to have a distance of closest approach of less than 10 mm and the fitted \u039e ++ cc vertex must have \u03c7 2 /ndf < 10. The \u039e ++ cc candidate is also required to point back to the PV, and to have p T > 4.5 GeV/c. Only events that passed the hardware trigger based on information from the muon and calorimeter systems that are not part of the reconstructed \u039e ++ cc event are used in the analysis [11]. Hence, the event is triggered independently of the reconstructed \u039e ++ cc candidate, which reduces the systematic uncertainty on the efficiency ratios between the \u039e ++ cc \u2192 D + pK \u2212 \u03c0 + and \u039e ++ cc \u2192 \u039b + c K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + decay modes.",

Simulated \u039e ++ cc decays are used to train the MLP classifier to recognise signal. Dedicated software triggers reconstruct an unphysical combination of D + pK + \u03c0 + (wrong-sign-plus, WSP) and D + pK \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 (wrong-sign-minus, WSM) data. The WSP and WSM samples are expected to be good proxies for combinatorial background in the \u039e ++ cc \u2192 D + pK \u2212 \u03c0 + (right-sign, RS) channel. For this analysis, WSP data in the 3550 \u2264 m(D + pK \u2212 \u03c0 + ) \u2264 3700 MeV/c 2 mass region is used to train the MLP classifier to identify background, while the WSM data is used to cross-check the results. Fifteen input variables are used in the MLP training. The variables with the best discriminating power between signal and background are: the \u039e ++ cc vertex fit with a kinematic refit [31] of the \u039e ++ cc decay chain requiring it to originate from its PV; the smallest p T of the four decay products of the \u039e ++ cc candidate; the angle between the \u039e ++ cc momentum vector and the direction from the PV to the \u039e ++ cc decay vertex; the \u03c7 2 IP of the \u039e ++ cc candidate with respect to its PV; the maximum distance of the closest approach between all pairs of \u039e ++ cc tracks forming the \u039e ++ cc candidate; and the maximum distance of the closest approach between all pairs of tracks from the decay of the D + candidate. To maintain a sizeable number of signal events, the hardware-trigger requirements are not applied to the signal and background samples. In addition to the training samples, disjoint testing samples are acquired from the same source. After training, the response of the MLP is compared between the training and testing samples. No signs of the MLP classifier being overtrained are found based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test statistic. Candidates are retained only if the MLP response output exceeds a certain threshold. The threshold is chosen by maximising the Punzi figure of merit [32], with a target significance of five sigma. To test for potential misreconstruction effects, the same selection criteria are applied to the WSP and WSM data; no peaking structures are visible in either control sample, as expected.",

The local p-value is defined as the probability of observing data that is less compatible with the background-only hypothesis than the data set. The test statistic used is based on q 0 in ref.

            "text": "The largest systematic uncertainty arises from the evaluation of the efficiency of the hardware-trigger requirement. Only candidates that are triggered independently of the \u039e ++ cc candidate's final-state tracks are used in the branching fraction ratio limit to minimise this systematic uncertainty. The ratio of these efficiencies is equal to one if the kinematic distributions of the \u039e ++ cc candidate in the \u039e ++ cc \u2192 D + pK \u2212 \u03c0 + and \u039e ++ cc \u2192 \u039b + c K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + decay modes are identical. However, the efficiencies can be different if the respective selection requirements of the \u039e ++ cc \u2192 D + pK \u2212 \u03c0 + and \u039e ++ cc \u2192 \u039b + c K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + analyses select different kinematic regions of the \u039e ++ cc candidate. This effect is studied by weighting the p T distributions in simulated samples. The change in efficiency of the hardware trigger after the weighting is evaluated and results in a systematic uncertainty of 3.5%. The impact of the model used to fit the m(\u039b + c K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + ) invariant-mass distribution on the yield of \u039e ++ cc candidates, N (\u039b + c K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + ), is investigated by using alternative signal and background models and performing the fit over different mass ranges. The largest variation in the yield of \u039e ++ cc candidates is 3.1% and this is taken as a systematic uncertainty on \u03b1 s . The effect of the uncertainty associated with the \u039e ++ cc baryon's lifetime on the relative reconstruction and selection efficiency between the \u039e ++ cc \u2192 D + pK \u2212 \u03c0 + and \u039e ++ cc \u2192 \u039b + c K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + channels is investigated by varying the lifetime within its uncertainty and a systematic uncertainty of 2.9% is assigned to the \u03b1 s parameter. The PID efficiency is determined in bins of particle momentum and pseudorapidity using calibration samples taken from data [35]. The size of the bins is increased or decreased by a factor of two and the largest deviation on \u03b1 s of 1.5% is assigned as systematic uncertainty. Finally, since the simulation may not describe the signal perfectly, simulated \u039e ++ cc \u2192 D + pK \u2212 \u03c0 + decays are weighted to make their p T distribution match that observed in the \u039e ++ cc \u2192 \u039b + c K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + data. The selection and software-trigger efficiencies are similarly calculated using p T -corrected simulated \u039e ++ cc decays. The number of p T bins used is increased or decreased by a factor of two and the efficiencies are recalculated for both decay channels. This results in a change in \u03b1 s of 1.2%. All efficiencies calculated from simulation are averaged over the entire phase space assuming a uniform distribution for both the \u039e ++ cc \u2192 D + pK \u2212 \u03c0 + and \u039e ++ cc \u2192 \u039b + c K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + decays. The phase-space distributions of the selected candidates are uniform and show agreement in data and simulation. Therefore, no systematic uncertainty is assigned to the relative selection and reconstruction efficiencies for the effect of intermediate resonances in their decay. Table 1 summarises the systematic and statistical uncertainties on \u03b1 s . The statistical uncertainty is dominated by the uncertainty of the yield of the normalisation mode but includes a small contribution from the finite size of the simulated samples. the branching fractions B(D + \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + ) and B(\u039b + c \u2192 pK \u2212 \u03c0 + ) have a combined uncertainty of 5.7%. The systematic uncertainties from the different sources discussed above are considered uncorrelated and are added in quadrature to give a total systematic uncertainty of 5.8%. Adding all sources of uncertainty in quadrature gives a total uncertainty of 17.7% on the \u03b1 s parameter.",
