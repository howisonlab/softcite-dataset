With four independent parameters, a 3 \u00d7 3 unitary matrix cannot be forced to be realvalued, and hence CP violation arises as a consequence of the fact that the couplings for quarks and antiquarks have different phases, i.e. V CKM = V * CKM . In the SM, all CP violation in the quark sector arises from this fact, which is encoded in the Wolfenstein parameter \u03b7. Moreover, all flavour-changing interactions of the quarks are described by the four parameters of the CKM matrix, which makes it a remarkably predictive paradigm, describing phenomena from the lowest energies (such as nuclear transitions and pion decays) to the highest (W boson and top quark decays) within the realm of acceleratorbased particle physics. Inevitably, a very broad range of theoretical tools (such as chiral perturbation theory, lattice quantum chromodynamics, and heavy quark effective theories) is needed to relate such diverse processes to the underlying physical parameters.",

The current experimental status of the neutron lifetime is controversial [7,23] (see also Refs. [24,25]), but future experiments should reduce its uncertainty.

The b \u2192 ul\u03bd decays can similarly be used to obtain measurements of |V ub | by either exclusive or inclusive methods. Most recent progress has been on the exclusive B \u2192 \u03c0l\u03bd decays, where new results have become available from both BaBar [53,54] and Belle [55], as shown in Fig. 7. The updated HFAG [8] average is [56] |V  where the dominant source of uncertainty is from the lattice QCD calculations of the form factors [57]. As was the case for |V cb |, there is a tension between inclusive and exclusive determinations (the world average value using the inclusive approach is |V ub | = (4.27 \u00b1 0.38) \u00d7 10 \u22123 . Although some commentators have pointed out that the large amount of theoretical work dedicated to the extraction of |V ub | may have led to an underestimation of the uncertainties [58], it is this author's view that more theoretical attention is necessary to resolve the situation. On the exclusive side, improvements in lattice QCD calculations can be expected, while on the inclusive side an initiative to reduce uncertainties using global fits is underway [59].",

Moreover, the SM CP violation, encoded in the CKM matrix, is not sufficient to explain the observed asymmetry. Therefore, there must be more sources of matter-antimatter asymmetry in nature. These could arise in almost any conceivable extension of the SM, such as in an extended quark sector, in the lepton sector (leptogenesis), from anomalous gauge couplings, in an extended Higgs sector, and so on. While all of these must be investigated, testing the consistency of the CKM mechanism in the quark sector provides the best chance to find new sources of CP violation in the short term.",

At the time of Lepton Photon, no significant signal for CP violation in charm had yet been seen; although the world average asymmetry in D + \u2192 K S \u03c0 + is more than 3 \u03c3 from zero [8] this is consistent with originating from the CP violation in the neutral kaon system (see Ref. [76] and references therein). However, while these proceedings were being prepared, LHCb announced a 3.5 \u03c3 signal for the difference in time-integrated CP asymmetries between D 0 \u2192 K + K \u2212 and D 0 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decays [77] (CDF have also released less precise results on the same observable [78]).",

The result on sin(2\u03b2) from B 0 d \u2192 J/\u03c8K S,L (etc.) with BaBar's final data set (445 million BB pairs) has been published [63], while preliminary results following a reprocessing of the Belle data (772 million BB pairs) are available [64]. A first analysis from LHCb is also available [79]. The results are compiled in Fig. 8. At the level of precision that the experiments are reaching, it is important to check for effects that may perturb the na\u00efve SM expectation S(J/\u03c8K S,L ) = \u2212\u03b7 CP sin(2\u03b2), where \u03b7 CP is the CP eigenvalue of the final state. This can be done using channels that are related by flavour symmetries -B 0 d \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c0 0 (related by SU(3)) or B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8K 0 S (related by U-spin). First observations of the latter decay have recently been reported by CDF and LHCb [80,81], suggesting that this approach will be possible with larger datasets.  Fig. 9. A few years ago, hints of deviations were apparent between the value of sin(2\u03b2 eff ) measured in b \u2192 qqs transitions and the reference value from b \u2192 ccs. These have diminished with the latest data, but effects of non-SM contributions at the O(10%) level are not ruled out. One notable update is the new Belle result on [82], which improves the consistency between the results of the two B factories as well as with the SM.",

In the short term, the BESIII and LHCb experiments, together with improved lattice calculations will, at the very least, advance our knowledge and may provide a breakthrough. In the certainty that new sources of CP violation exist, somewhere, and with various other reasons to expect non-SM physics around the TeV scale (or higher) to cause observable effects in flavour-changing interactions in the quark sector, continued study of the elements of the CKM matrix remains a key cornerstone of the global particle physics programme.",
