The data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 20.6 (19.7) fb \u22121 for the dimuon (dielectron) channel. No evidence for non-standard-model physics is observed and 95% confidence level limits are set on parameters from a number of new physics models. The narrow resonance analyses exclude a Sequential Standard Model Z SSM resonance lighter than 2.90 TeV, a superstring-inspired Z \u03c8 lighter than 2.57 TeV, and Randall-Sundrum Kaluza-Klein gravitons with masses below 2.73, 2.35, and 1.27 TeV for couplings of 0.10, 0.05, and 0.01, respectively. A notable feature is that the limits have been calculated in a model-independent way to enable straightforward reinterpretation in any model predicting a resonance structure. The observed events are also interpreted within the framework of two non-resonant analyses: one based on a large extra dimensions model and one based on a quark and lepton compositeness model with a left-left isoscalar contact interaction. Lower limits are established on M S , the scale characterizing the onset of quantum gravity, which range from 4.9 to 3.3 TeV, where the number of additional spatial dimensions varies from 3 to 7. Similarly, lower limits on \u039b, the energy scale parameter for the contact interaction, are found to be 12.0 (15.2) TeV for destructive (constructive) interference in the dimuon channel and 13.5 (18.3) TeV in the dielectron channel.",

The approach described in this paper is designed to be independent of specific model assumptions, allowing the results to be reinterpreted for any model predicting a spin-1 or spin-2 narrow resonance. A generic resonance is denoted by Z in this paper; wherever a specific model is implied a subscript is used to specify the model. The search results are interpreted in the context of various models: the Sequential Standard Model Z SSM with SM-like couplings [2], the Z \u03c8 possible in grand unified theories where the gauge group is E 6 [3,4], and Kaluza-Klein graviton (G KK ) excitations arising in the Randall-Sundrum (RS) model of extra dimensions [5,6]. For a resonance mass of 2.5 TeV, the widths of the Z SSM and Z \u03c8 are 80 and 14 GeV. Similarly, the G KK widths are 3.5, 9.0, and 35 GeV for G KK coupling parameters k/M Pl of 0.01, 0.05, and 0.10, where k is the warp factor of n-dimensional anti-de Sitter space and M Pl is the reduced Planck scale.",

In the HLZ convention, the parameters that define the characteristics of the model are the ultraviolet cutoff scale of the divergent sum of the KK graviton excitations M S , which characterizes the onset of quantum gravity effects [13], and the number of extra spatial dimensions n ED . These can be related to the similar ultraviolet cutoff scale \u039b T in the GRW convention: 1) where M is the dilepton invariant mass. The HLZ and GRW conventions are based on effective field theory, which is expected to break down at the energy scale M max at which quantum gravity effects become strong, i.e. close to M S (HLZ) or \u039b T (GRW). In this analysis, when presenting results in the HLZ (GRW) convention it is assumed that M max is equal to M S (\u039b T ). The results do not depend strongly on the exact choice of M max for a broad range of M max values around the chosen cutoff scale [14].",

The existence of three families of quarks and leptons might be explained if these particles are composed of more fundamental constituents. In order to confine the constituents and to account for the properties of quarks and leptons, a new strong gauge interaction, metacolor, is introduced. Below a given interaction energy scale \u039b, the effect of the metacolor interaction is to bind the constituents into metacolor-singlet states. For parton-parton centre-of-mass energies less than \u039b, the metacolor force will manifest itself in the form of a flavour-diagonal CI [15]. The model considered here is the left-left isoscalar model, which is the conventional benchmark for CI in the dilepton channel. The predicted differential JHEP04 (2015)025cross section includes an interference term, which may be positive or negative, and the measurements are interpreted in the context of both possibilities.",

For each compatible pair of tracks the set of space points is fitted to form a track that spans the entire detector [33]. For muons with p T < 200 GeV, the transverse momentum resolution is dominated by the resolution on track parameters in the inner tracker [33]. However, above 200 GeV the muon stations also contribute significantly to the precision of the measurement. The muon p T resolution is estimated using collision data and cosmic rays to be around 2% for p T \u2248 100 GeV and better than 10% for p T \u2248 1 TeV, for muons reconstructed in the barrel. Monte Carlo simulations reproduce the performance observed in collision data and cosmic rays. Each of the muon candidates is required to have p T > 45 GeV and \u03b4(p T )/p T < 0.3, where \u03b4(p T ) is the uncertainty in the measured p T of the track. The muons must lie within the acceptance of the muon detectors, |\u03b7| < 2.4, furthermore the muon that triggers the event must be within |\u03b7| < 2.1 as a consequence of the trigger criteria. The muon candidates are required to have a transverse impact parameter of less than 0.2 cm with respect to the primary vertex position, at least one hit in the pixel detector, hits in at least six silicon-strip tracker layers, and matched segments in two or more muon stations. To suppress backgrounds from non-prompt muons, the scalar sum of the p T of all other tracks with a z impact parameter within 0.2 cm of the relevant primary vertex and lying within a cone of \u2206R < 0.3 about the track of the muon candidate, is required to be less than 10% of the p T of the candidate. The impact parameter criterion also reduces the effect of tracks originating from additional pp interactions occurring in the same bunch crossing (pileup) on reconstructed quantities. Its effectiveness was assessed using muons arising from Z bosons where efficiencies have been shown to agree in data and JHEP04(2015)025 simulation. When varying the average number of pileup events between 0 and 30 a change of less than 1% is observed in the muon selection efficiency.",

The resulting cluster-track matched pairs form electron candidates. These candidates are required to have E T > 35 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.5, excluding the barrel-endcap transition region 1.442 < |\u03b7| < 1.560. To suppress the misidentification of jets as electrons, the sum of the p T of all other tracks in a cone of \u2206R < 0.3 around the track of the electron candidate is required to be less than 5 GeV, which imposes an isolation condition on the track. To be used in the calculation of the isolation of the candidate track, the tracks have to be within 0.2 cm, in the z direction, of the primary vertex with which the electron candidates are associated. This requirement reduces the impact of pileup. For electrons with transverse energies above 100 GeV, a negligible change in the selection efficiency is observed as the number of pileup events increases from 0 to 40. For electrons identified as arising from Z bosons, i.e. where the E T are much lower than 100 GeV, the efficiency falls by between 5 and 10% depending on the region of the detector in which the electrons are detected. Within this same cone, the sum of the E T of the energy deposits in the calorimeter that are not associated with the candidate is required to be less than 3% (plus a small \u03b7-dependent offset) of the candidate E T . This sum, which allows a selection on the isolation of the electron candidate, is corrected for the average energy density in the event [35] to minimize the dependence of the efficiency of this selection criterion on pileup. Further suppression of the misidentification of jets as electrons is achieved by requiring that the profile of the energy deposition in the ECAL be consistent with that expected for an electron, and that the sum of HCAL energy deposits in a cone of \u2206R < 0.15 be less than 5% of the ECAL energy of the electron. The track associated with the cluster is required to have no more than one hit missing in the pixel layers, and in the transverse plane to lie within 0.02 cm (barrel) or 0.05 cm (endcaps) of the primary vertex associated with the candidates. The energy resolution for the selected electrons varies between approximately 1.0 and 3.5% depending on the momentum, the extent of bremsstrahlung emission and the point of incidence on the ECAL [36].",

In the resonance analysis, limits are set on R \u03c3 , which is the ratio of the product of cross section and branching fraction for Z production relative to that for Z bosons. In the non-resonant analyses the relevant ratio is the one between the summed events above the minimum mass threshold and the number of events in the Z peak region. Therefore the simulation does not need to reproduce the absolute value of the efficiency in data; it must however correctly reproduce the evolution of the efficiency with E T . Data are used to measure the electron identification efficiency at the Z resonance, using the tag-and-probe method [16,32,33]. The ratio of this efficiency to that found in simulation is 0.997 \u00b1 0.007 for electrons in the barrel region and 0.979 \u00b1 0.006 in the endcaps. This ratio was also studied as a function of the probe electron E T to \u223c500 GeV and as a function of the tag-and-probe pair mass up to \u223c1 TeV, and was found to be invariant with respect to these quantities, although the systematic and statistical uncertainties become large at high transverse energies and masses. Using these scale factors, JHEP04(2015)025 the total efficiency to reconstruct and select electrons with p T > 100 GeV is expected to be (88 \u00b1 2)% in the barrel region and (84 \u00b1 4)% in the endcaps, where the uncertainties cover the extrapolation of the data-to-simulation ratio to very high transverse momenta. This gives efficiencies for electron pairs of 78% where both electrons are in the barrel and 75% where one of the electrons is in the endcap. A similar procedure is used to evaluate the muon identification efficiency. Applying the tag-and-probe technique to muons from Z boson decays, and using tracks in the silicon inner tracker as probes, the total muon identification efficiency (including isolation) is measured to be (95 \u00b1 1)% in the barrel and endcap regions. The corresponding efficiency ratios between data and the simulation are 0.990 \u00b1 0.005 and 0.993 \u00b1 0.005, respectively. To within the statistical precision available using the 2012 data sample, both the efficiencies and the related correction factors remain constant up to a p T of approximately 300 GeV. With these correction factors applied, the combined reconstruction and selection efficiency for triggered events in the acceptance region is expected to be (89 \u00b1 2)% at a mass of 200 GeV. The simulation predicts that the efficiency above 200 GeV is constant to within 3%.",

Muons in dimuon events are therefore required to have charges of opposite sign. Dielectron events are separated into barrel-barrel and barrel-endcap categories, because of the different signal-to-background ratios and mass resolutions in the two regions. The measurement of the energy of the electron depends only upon the energy deposition in the ECAL and therefore is independent of the charge of the particle. The opposite-sign requirement is therefore not applied to dielectron events since this would only result in a loss of efficiency without providing useful background suppression.",

An electron deposits its energy over an array of crystals approximately 5 \u00d7 5 in extent. In general, only the energy deposited in the central crystal will significantly exceed the energies at which calibrations are performed. Given the shape of the electromagnetic shower, the energy of the central crystal can be predicted from the energy distribution in the surrounding 24 crystals. This is done using both an algorithmic fit to the distributions and an artificial neural network. The difference between the observed energy E 1 in the central crystal and the energy reconstructed, E rec 1 , is calculated from data using the above method. The distribution (E 1 \u2212 E rec 1 )/E 1 obtained using simulated data results in a displacement from zero of the mean of the distribution of less than 0.01. For electrons in the data with energies above 500 GeV, the distribution found using simulation agrees with that for the data, where displacements of the mean are observed to be less than 0.01 in both the barrel and endcap regions. This procedure has also been adapted to reconstruct the energies in any crystals in a cluster where the readout is not functioning.

If more than two leptons passing all selection criteria are present in an event, the pair with the largest invariant mass is chosen. The largest dimuon invariant mass observed is 1840 GeV and the largest dielectron mass is 1790 GeV. In figures 2 and 3 the contribution labeled \"Jets\" consists of events where at least one jet has been misreconstructed as a lepton. The other background components are derived from simulations. The relative fractions of the simulated processes are fixed by their theoretical cross sections, and the total simulated background contribution is normalized to the number of events in the data in the region of 60 < m < 120 GeV. The p T > 45 GeV selection requirement on the muons removes most of the events in this mass range, and also has a significant effect on the efficiency of events above this mass region (but well below the search region of interest). To derive the normalization for dimuon production, a prescaled trigger, which is identical to the main muon trigger but with a lower p T selection criterion, is used to select events. The use of this trigger allows the offline p T threshold criterion to be lowered to 27 GeV. Figure 4 shows the corresponding cumulative distributions of the spectra. The SM expected yields in various mass bins are shown compared to the observed yields in tables 2 and 3. These plots and the tables illustrate that there is good agreement between observation and expectation in the whole explored region including dilepton masses above 1 TeV. The analyses are designed to look for evidence of beyond the JHEP04 2015  Table 2.",

To ensure the background is properly constrained, the lower edge of the window is adjusted so that there are at least 400 events in the mass window. The observed limits have been found to be robust and do not significantly change for reasonable variations in the limit setting procedure, such as modifications in the window for accepting events in the likelihood and changes in the background normalization and shape. Figure 5 shows the observed and expected upper limits on the ratio R \u03c3 of the production cross section times branching fraction of a Z boson relative to that for a Z boson, for the dimuon and dielectron channels. Figure 6 shows the upper limits for the combined dimuon and dielectron channels for the two spin hypotheses. The figures also show the predicted ratios of cross section times branching fraction for Z SSM and Z \u03c8 production; together with those for G KK production, with the dimensionless graviton coupling to SM fields k/M Pl = 0.05, 0.01, and 0.1. The LO cross section predictions for Z SSM and Z \u03c8 from pythia using the CTEQ6.1 PDF set [59] are corrected by a mass-dependent K-factor obtained using zwprodp [60][61][62], to account for the NNLO QCD contributions. The calculated Z cross sections include generated dileptons with masses only within \u00b15% \u221a s of the nominal resonance mass, to enhance sensitivity to a narrow-width resonance [43]. The NNLO prediction used for the Z/\u03b3 * production cross section in the mass window of 60 to 120 GeV is 1.117 nb, which was calculated using fewz [47]. The theoretical uncertainty is expected to be 4%, based on 7 TeV studies where factorization and renormalization scales were varied and an uncertainty from PDFs included. No uncertainties in cross sections for the various theoretical Z models are included when determining the limits.",
