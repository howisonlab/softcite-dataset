The data sample, collected by the CDF II detector at the Fermilab Tevatron, corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 2.6 fb \u22121 . Candidate events are selected by requiring two or more jets and a large imbalance in the transverse momentum. To enhance the analysis sensitivity, at least one of the jets is required to be identified as originating from a charm quark using an algorithm specifically designed for this analysis. The selected events are in good agreement with standard model predictions. In the case of large mass splitting between the scalar top quark and the neutralino we exclude a scalar top quark mass below 180 GeV/c 2 at 95% confidence level.",

            "text": "The standard model (SM) of elementary particles and fundamental interactions, however successful, is still incomplete since it does not explain the origin of electroweak symmetry breaking and does not give an answer to the gauge hierarchy problem [1]. A possible extension of the SM, supersymmetry (SUSY) [2], solves these problems by introducing a symmetry that relates particles of different spin. R-parity [2] conserving SUSY models also provide a prime candidate for the dark matter in the universe [3,4], namely the stable lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP). In these models, the left-handed and right-handed quarks have scalar partners, respectively denoted asq L andq R , which can mix to form scalar quarks with mass eigenstatesq 1,2 . Several models [5] predict that this mixing can be substantial for the scalar top (stop), yielding a stop mass eigenstate (t 1 ) significantly lighter than other scalar quarks. If thet 1 is sufficiently light, it can be pair-produced copiously in proton-antiproton collisions at center-of-mass energy of \u221a s = 1.96 TeV at the Tevatron.",

The charged-particle tracking system consists of silicon microstrip detectors and a cylindrical open-cell drift chamber, both of which are immersed in a 1.4 T solenoidal magnetic field coaxial with the beam line. The silicon detectors provide coverage in the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| \u2264 2 and are used to identify events with long-lived particle decays. The drift chamber surrounds the silicon detectors, has maximum tracking efficiency up to |\u03b7| = 1, and is used for charged particle momentum measurements. Segmented sampling calorimeters, which surround the tracking system, are arranged in a projective tower geometry and are used to measure the energy of interacting particles in the region |\u03b7| < 3.6. Muon candidates are identified by drift chambers, which extend up to |\u03b7| = 1.5, and are located outside the calorimeter volume. Jets are reconstructed from the energy depositions in the calorimeter cells using an iterative cone jet-clustering algorithm [9], with a cone size of radius R = (\u2206\u03c6) 2 + (\u2206\u03b7) 2 = 0.7. Energy corrections [10] are applied to account for effects such as non-linear calorimeter response, underlying event, and the position of the interaction point, that influence the measured transverse jet energy. Candidate events used for this search are selected by an online event selection system (trigger) that requires E T \u2265 35 GeV and two jets. Further selections are applied off-line to remove accelerator-produced and detector-related backgrounds as well as cosmic-ray events. After off-line event reconstruction, the events are required to have E T \u2265 50 GeV, and at least two jets with |\u03b7| \u2264 2.4 and E T \u2265 25 GeV. The highest-E T jet is required to have E T \u2265 35 GeV and at least one of the selected jets is required to be in the region |\u03b7| \u2264 0.9.",

The alpgen ( [12]; we use alpgen v. 2.10) event generator interfaced with the parton-shower model from the pythia [13] event generator is used to estimate the electroweak boson production, the madgraph [14] generator is used to model the single top events, while the pythia event generator is used to model the topquark pair and diboson backgrounds. For the event generation the CTEQ5L [15] parton distribution functions (PDFs) are used. Simulated events are passed through the geant3based [16] CDF II detector simulation [17] and are weighted by the probability that they would pass the trigger selection. The single top-quark and diboson contributions are normalized to the theoretical cross sections [18][19][20][21].

The three control regions used to validate the SM prediction are denoted as multijet, lepton, and preoptimization regions. The multijet control region is defined to have the second leading E T jet direction ( j 2 ) aligned with the \u2212 \u2192 E T , where aligned means \u2206\u03c6( \u2212 \u2192 E T , j 2 ) \u2264 0.4 rad. This HF multijet enriched region is used to obtain the MUTARE parameterization to predict the HF multijet background in the other control and signal regions. The lepton control region is defined to have j 2 direction not aligned with the \u2212 \u2192 E T (\u2206\u03c6( \u2212 \u2192 E T , j 2 ) \u2265 0.7 rad) and at least one isolated charged lepton (e or \u00b5) with p T \u2265 10 GeV/c . This lepton region is used to validate the modeling of the top quark and electroweak W/Z boson backgrounds. The pre-optimization control region is defined to have the leading and second leading E T jets not aligned with the \u2212 \u2192 E T and to have no identified leptons, where the lepton definition is the same as in the lepton control region. We studied kinematic distributions such as jet E T , E T , as well as the total numbers of events predicted. All these quantities are in agreement with observations in the three control regions. As an example, the E T distributions for the pre-optimization region are shown in figure 1. Table 1 presents the expected event yields for various background processes in the control regions under study.",

The two-dimensional output structure allows the separation of the three different targets during the same training process.
