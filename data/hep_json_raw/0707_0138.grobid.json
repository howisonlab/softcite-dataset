            "text": "We present a search for the rare decays B \u2192 h ( * ) \u03bd\u03bd, where h ( * ) stands for a light meson. A data sample of 535 million BB pairs collected with the Belle detector at the KEKB e + e \u2212 collider is used. Signal candidates are required to have an accompanying B meson fully reconstructed in a hadronic mode and signal-side particles consistent with a single h ( * ) meson. No significant signal is observed and we set upper limits on the branching fractions at 90% confidence level. The limits on B 0 \u2192 K * 0 \u03bd\u03bd and B + \u2192 K + \u03bd\u03bd decays are more stringent than the previous constraints, while the first searches for B 0 \u2192 K 0 \u03bd\u03bd, \u03c0 0 \u03bd\u03bd, \u03c1 0 \u03bd\u03bd, \u03c6\u03bd\u03bd and B + \u2192 K * + \u03bd\u03bd, \u03c1 + \u03bd\u03bd are reported. The decays B \u2192 K ( * ) \u03bd\u03bd proceed through the flavorchanging neutral-current process b \u2192 s\u03bd\u03bd, which is sensitive to physics beyond the Standard Model (SM). The dominant SM diagrams are shown in Fig. 1. Similarly, the decays B \u2192 (\u03c0, \u03c1)\u03bd\u03bd proceed through b \u2192 d\u03bd\u03bd processes. The SM branching fractions are estimated to be 1.3\u00d710 \u22125 and 4\u00d710 \u22126 for B \u2192 K * \u03bd\u03bd and B \u2192 K\u03bd\u03bd decays [1], respectively, and are expected to be much lower for other modes. Theoretical calculation of the decay amplitudes for B \u2192 h ( * ) \u03bd\u03bd is particularly reliable, owing to the absence of long-distance interactions that affect charged-lepton channels B \u2192 h ( * ) l + l \u2212 . New physics such as SUSY particles or a possible fourth generation could potentially contribute to the penguin loop or box diagram and enhance the branching fractions [1]. Reference [2] also discusses the possibility of discovering light dark matter in b \u2192 s transitions with large missing momentum. Experimental measurements [3] of the b \u2192 s transitions with two charged leptons are in good agreement with SM calculations [1]. Further investigation of the forward-backward asymmetry in B \u2192 K * l + l \u2212 [4] is consistent with the SM although the statistics are still limited. Due to the challenge of cleanly detecting rare modes with two final-state neutrinos, only a few studies of K ( * ) \u03bd\u03bd have been carried out to date [5,6,7]; there is only one examination of the corresponding b \u2192 d transitions [7]. In this paper, we report our first search for the decays B \u2192 h ( * ) \u03bd\u03bd (h ( * ) stands for K + , K 0 S , K * 0 , K * + , \u03c0 + , \u03c0 0 , \u03c1 0 , \u03c1 + , and \u03c6) using a 492 fb \u22121 data sample recorded at the \u03a5(4S) resonance, corresponding to 535 \u00d7 10 6 B-meson pairs. Charge-conjugate decays are implied throughout this paper.",

A larger uncertainty of 13%, which is estimated from the difference between the default decay model and a generic three-body phase-space model, is introduced for B 0 \u2192 \u03c6\u03bd\u03bd decays. Furthermore, the following uncertainties are also considered: the number of BB events (1.3%), tracking efficiency (1.0-2.2%), particle identifica-tion (0.5-2.0%), h ( * ) mass selection (0.8-2.3%), and the \u03c6 \u2192 K + K \u2212 branching fraction (1.2%).",

No significant signal is observed and we set upper limits on the branching fractions at 90% CL. The limits obtained for B 0 \u2192 K * 0 \u03bd\u03bd and B + \u2192 K + \u03bd\u03bd decays are more stringent than the previous constraints from DELPHI [5] and BaBar [7]. The first searches for B 0 \u2192 K 0 \u03bd\u03bd, \u03c0 0 \u03bd\u03bd, \u03c1 0 \u03bd\u03bd, \u03c6\u03bd\u03bd, and B + \u2192 K * + \u03bd\u03bd, \u03c1 + \u03bd\u03bd are carried out, and upper limits on the branching fraction of order 10 \u22124 are obtained. The limit on B + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03bd\u03bd is less restrictive than BaBar's result [7] due to a larger number of observed events in the signal box. The results on B \u2192 K ( * ) \u03bd\u03bd reported here are one order of magnitude above the predictions of Buchalla et al. [1] and hence still allow room for substantial non-SM contributions. A higher luminosity B-factory experiment is required to probe the SM predictions for the branching fractions. ",
