The data sample of 711 fb \u22121 used in this analysis corresponds to 772 million BB pairs, collected at the \u03a5(4S) resonance by the Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric-energy e + e \u2212 collider. We observe 19.8\u03c3 and 10.8\u03c3 excesses of events for the two decay modes and measure the branching fractions of B 0 \u2192 p\u039bD \u2212 and B 0 \u2192 p\u039bD * \u2212 to be (25.1\u00b12.6\u00b13.5)\u00d710 \u22126 and (33.6\u00b16.3\u00b14.4)\u00d710 \u22126 , respectively, where the first uncertainties are statistical and the second are systematic. These results are not compatible with the predictions based on the generalized factorization approach. In addition, a threshold enhancement in the di-baryon (p\u039b) system is observed, consistent with that observed in similar B decays.",

Although the general pattern of these decays can be understood as the interplay between the short-distance weak interaction and the long-distance strong interaction [8], theories still have difficulties ad-justing for various details such as the angular correlation between the energetic outgoing meson and one specific baryon (B) in the di-baryon system [7,[9][10][11].",

More intriguingly, the factorization approach fails to provide a satisfactory explanation for the M-p angular correlations in B \u2212 \u2192 ppK \u2212 , B 0 \u2192 p\u039b\u03c0 \u2212 , and B \u2212 \u2192 ppD \u2212 [7,[9][10][11].

A study of pure current-type decays like B 0 \u2192 p\u039bD ( * )\u2212 is useful to shed more light on the afore mentioned phenomena.

The modeling uncertainty is estimated by comparing the efficiency calculation based on two different MC samples, one generated assuming p-\u039b bound states and the other with three-body phase-space decays, in each M p\u039b bin. As the result is highly threshold-enhanced, we use the efficiency given by the bound-state model to calculate the branching fractions and take the differences as the systematic uncertainties between the two models. The uncertainty is about 3 (2)% in the D (D * ) mode, depending on the bins. For each charged track except the low-momentum pion in D * \u2212 \u2192D 0 \u03c0 \u2212 , a 0.35% uncertainty is assigned to take into account the data-MC difference in the charged  track reconstruction. For the low-momentum pion, a 2.5% uncertainty is assigned. We use the \u039b \u2192 p\u03c0 \u2212 and D * + \u2192 D 0 \u03c0 + , D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + samples to calibrate the MC p (\u2212) , K \u00b1 , \u03c0 \u00b1 identification efficiencies and assign uncertainties. For the\u039b reconstruction, we estimate the uncertainty by considering the data-MC difference of tracks displaced from the IP, the\u039b proper time, and\u039b mass distributions. The uncertainties due to the \u03b1 D ( * ) selections are estimated separately with the control sample mode, B 0 \u2192 \u03c0 + K 0 S D ( * )\u2212 . We compare the data-MC efficiency differences with or without the \u03b1 selections, where the non-negligible statistical uncertainties are also included. In both cases, the obtained B(B 0 \u2192 \u03c0 + K 0 S D ( * )\u2212 ) is found to be consistent with the world average, indicating overall reliability of our methodology. For the \u03b2 D and \u03b2 D * selections, we compare the widths of the peaking components in M D \u2212 and M D * \u2212 \u2212 MD0 in the MC and data and quote the differences as the uncertainties.

The threshold enhancement effect observed in M p\u039b is found to be consistent with many other three-body baryonic B decays. The obtained branching fractions disagree with predictions based on the factorization approach, as do the measured ratios of branching fractions, both for the D and D * modes and for the charged and neutral B modes. We also find potential angular asymmetry in the D * mode but not in the D mode. Theoretical explanations, as well as confirmation from experiments with sizable data sets, such as LHCb and Belle II, will be needed in the future.",
