Differential cross sections d 4 \u03c3/dtdQ 2 dx B d\u03c6\u03c0 and structure functions \u03c3 T + \u03c3 L , \u03c3 T T and \u03c3 LT as functions of t were obtained over a wide range of Q 2 and x B . The data are compared with the GPD based theoretical models. Analyses find that a large dominance of transverse processes is necessary to explain the experimental results. Generalized form factors of the transversity GPDs H T \u03c0,\u03b7 and \u0112 T \u03c0,\u03b7 were directly extracted from the experimental observables for the first time. It was found that GPD\u0112 T dominates in pseudoscalar meson production. The combined \u03c0 0 and \u03b7 data opens the way for the flavor decomposition of the transversity GPDs. The first ever evaluation of this decomposition was demonstrated.",

            "text": "Understanding nucleon structure in terms of the fundamental degrees of freedom of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is one of the main goals in the theory of strong interactions. In recent years it became clear that exclusive reactions may provide information about hadron structure encoded in so-called Generalized Parton Distributions 1,2 (GPDs). For each quark flavor q there are eight GPDs. Four correspond to parton helicity-conserving (chiral-even) processes, denoted by H q ,H q , E q and E q , and four correspond to parton helicity-flip (chiral-odd) processes, 3, 4 H q T ,H q T , E q T and\u1ebc q T . The GPDs depend on three kinematic variables: x, \u03be and t. In a symmetric frame, x is the average longitudinal momentum fraction of the struck parton before and after the hard interaction and \u03be (skewness) is half of the longitudinal momentum fraction transferred to the struck parton. The skewness can be expressed in terms of the Bjorken variable 2 , where p and p are the initial and final four-momenta of the nucleon.",

            "text": "When the theoretical calculations for longitudinal virtual photons were compared with the JLab \u03c0 0 data 5,6 they were found to underestimate the measured cross sections by more than an order of magnitude in their accessible kinematic regions. The failure to describe the experimental results with quark helicity-conserving operators stimulated a consideration of the role of the chiral-odd quark helicity-flip processes. Pseudoscalar meson electroproduction, and in particular \u03c0 0 production in the reaction ep \u2192 e p \u03c0 0 , was identified [7][8][9] as especially sensitive to the quark helicityflip subprocesses. During the past few years, two parallel theoretical approaches (GL) 7, 10 and (GK) 8,9 have been developed utilizing the chiral-odd GPDs in the calculation of pseudoscalar meson electroproduction. The GL and GK approaches, though employing different models of GPDs, lead to transverse photon amplitudes that are much larger than the longitudinal amplitudes.",

Structure functions \u03c3 U = \u03c3 T + \u03c3 L , \u03c3 LT and \u03c3 T T have been obtained. These functions were compared with the predictions of the GPD models. 9, 10 CLAS confirmed that the measured unseparated cross sections are much larger than expected from leading-twist handbag calculations which are dominated by longitudinal photons. The same conclusion can be made in an almost model-independent way by noting that the structure functions \u03c3 U and |\u03c3 T T | are comparable to each other while |\u03c3 LT | is quite small (see Fig.1). Cross section and structure functions for ep \u2192 e\u03b7p were also obtained in parallel. The comparison of the \u03c0 0 and preliminary \u03b7 structure functions is shown in Fig. 1. \u03c3 U drops by a factor of 2.5 for \u03b7 in comparison with \u03c0 0 and \u03c3 T T drops by a factor of 10.
