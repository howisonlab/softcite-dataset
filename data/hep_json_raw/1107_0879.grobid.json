Double-pion production in nucleon-nucleon (N N) collisions is of particular interest in view of studying the simultaneous excitation of the two baryons and their subsequent decays. Here, the simplest case is considered: the excitation of the two nucleons into the (1232) resonance. The reaction reported on here provides the unique possibility to study this process exclusively in very detail at its optimal energy of T p = 1.4 GeV, which corresponds to \u221a s = 2.48 GeV \u2248 2m .",

A full reaction model describing the double-pion production in N N collisions has been developed recently by Alvarez-Ruso et al. (Valencia model) [8]. More recent calculations by Cao, Zou and Xu include relativistic corrections not taken into account by the Valencia model, however, neglect interference between different reaction amplitudes [9]. These models include both resonant and non-resonant terms of \u03c0\u03c0 -production and predict the two-pion production process to be dominated by resonance excitation: At energies near threshold it is dominated by the excitation of one of the nucleons into the Roper resonance N * (1440)P 11 via \u03c3 -exchange, followed by its s-wave decay N * \u2192 N(\u03c0 \u03c0) s-wave",

More recently, exclusive high-statistics measurements have become available from near threshold (T p = 650 MeV) up to T p = 1.3 GeV from the PROMICE/WASA [12][13][14], CELSIUS/WASA [15][16][17][18][19], COSY-TOF [20], WASA-at-COSY [21] and COSY-ANKE [22] experiments. The analyses of the data obtained from these experiments indicate that, indeed as predicted, in case of pp collisions (isovector channel) only two t-channel reaction mechanisms dominate: the excitation of the Roper resonance N * (1440) at energies close to threshold [13,16], and the excitation of the system at energies T p > 1.1 GeV [18]. In fact, the pp \u2192 pp\u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 reaction, which due to its isospin situation is the most suited reaction for studying these two resonance excitations [17], exhibits a distinctive dip in the slope of the total cross section separating the regions of dominance for Roper and processes. Model predictions are found to be in good agreement with the experimental results at energies close to threshold, if the branching * Corresponding author at: LHEP, Physikalisches Institut, University of Bern, Sidlerstrasse 5, 3018 Bern, Switzerland. E-mail address: tamer.tolba@lhep.unibe.ch (T. Tolba ratio used in Ref. [8] for the decay N * \u2192 \u03c0 \u2192 N\u03c0 \u03c0 is adjusted to the more recent experimental findings [5,13,14,20,18,23]. At energies T p 1 GeV, the Roper resonance contribution to the total cross section is strongly over-predicted in the Valencia calculations due to the too large branching ratio assumed there [8]. As shown in Ref. [18] the Valencia calculation is also at variance with the differential data for the process. However, if the \u03c1 exchange, which in the Valencia model is the dominating exchange process interfering destructively with the \u03c0 exchange, is strongly reduced and if also relativistic corrections are taken into account, then reasonable agreement with the data is obtained. Thus all three changes (modified Valencia model) lead then to a satisfactory description of all data from threshold up to T p = 1.3 GeV [18].",

The innermost detector, the mini drift chamber, is housed within the magnetic field of a superconducting solenoid and is used in determining the momenta of charged particles. The next layer, the plastic scintillator barrel provides fast signal for first level trigger and charged particle identification. As the outermost layer, 1012 CsI(Na) crystals of the calorimeter enable the measurement of the energy deposited by charged particles as well as the reconstruction of  electromagnetic showers. Due to the different size of the crystals, it was found that the energy and angle resolutions for the photons in the calorimeter are dependent on their energies and scattering angles, with average values of 15% and 1.5 \u2022 for energy and angular resolutions, respectively. The forward detection system covers the polar angular range of 3 \u2022 -18 \u2022 . The multi-plane straw tube detector is implemented for the precise reconstruction of charged particle track coordinates. An arrangement of segmented plastic scintillator layers, the forward range hodoscope, is used to reconstruct kinetic energies of scattered particles by the E-E technique. A three-layered thin hodoscope provides fast charged particle discrimination. The forward detector can provide a tag on meson production via the missing mass of the reconstructed recoil particles. The proton energy resolution shows an approximately constant value of bout 3% for protons up to T p = 360 MeV which is the maximum energy for which protons can be stopped by the forward range hodoscope layers. The resolution worsens for more energetic protons and reaches about 20% for 1 GeV protons. The angular resolution of the protons in the forward detector is 0.15 \u2022 . The trigger for the present experiment demanded at least one charged particle candidate to reach the first layer of the forward range hodoscope.

On the one hand, this technique is a powerful tool in distinguishing between the different particle species that are stopped in the detector. On the other hand, it is also used in distinguishing between particles stopped in the detector elements and those, which punch through. The depicted selection criterion (the solid lines) selects not only protons that are stopped in the forward range hodoscope but also those that punch through. The selection helps to reject the contribution resulting from hadronic interactions in detector material. The kinetic energy of the protons is reconstructed by translating the summed deposited energy over all the forward detector layers, after they have been corrected for the energy losses in the dead material between the detector layers as well as the quenching effect in the plastic scintillator.

For consistency, the kinematic fit routine is always applied with one unmeasured proton in the final state, with this assumption the number of constraints reduced to three. Hence, in the case where two protons are registered in the forward detector only one proton is selected and the other one is ignored. The proton with the lower energy is found to have better resolution. Therefore, it is chosen as the measured value in the kinematic fit routine while the higher energy  one is treated as the unmeasured variable. In order to suppress events that do not satisfy the kinematic fit conditions a cut-off at the 10% confidence level was applied. This specific cut was chosen because it has the largest product of combinatorial purity and reconstructed efficiency, where both data and Monte Carlo simulations are in the plateau region -for more details see Ref.

The total cross section error is evaluated in terms of statistical and systematic uncertainties. The statistical error is found to be < 1% and thus negligible compared to the systematic contribution. The systematic error is constructed from two terms, systematic effects and normalization. The systematic contribution is estimated by observing the variation of the results with different analysis constraints where the varied parameters are assumed to be independent of each other. The systematic term is calculated from the following main contributions: 1) applying different selection regions to the flat part of the confidence level (probability) distribution of the kinematic fit, the contribution from this term is found to be 5%, 2) the contribution from the correction for the detector acceptance generated by different Monte Carlo models (the tuned toy model, the model of Ref.

The total error from the systematic term is the square root of the quadratic sum of the individual terms and found to be 6.5%. The normalization term is constructed from two main components: 1) contribution from the pp \u2192 pp\u03b7 analysis, found to be 14%, and 2) the uncertainty of the cross section value in Ref. [27] which is found to be 11%. The total error contribution from the normalization term is estimated to be 18%. Fig. 4 compares the cross section from this work (solid circle) with the previous experimental data [10][11][12]17,18,24] and to the  [12], CELSIUS/WASA (filled triangles) [17] and at 1.36 GeV (square) [24], bubble chamber results (inverted triangles) [10] and (star) [11], the theoretical calculations of Ref. [8] (dashed line) and of Ref. [18] (solid line). theoretical expectations calculated in Refs. [8,18]. The data point from this work is compatible with the previous results [10-12, 17,18,24] and corroborates the strongly rising trend of the cross section starting at \u223c 1170 MeV. As has been verified in Ref. [17], the trend of rising total cross sections from threshold up to T p \u223c 1 GeV is due to the dominance of the Roper resonance. Above 1 GeV, it levels off and proceeds with only a slight increase up to T p \u223c 1170 MeV. The rise in the cross section values at higher energies T p > 1170 MeV is associated with the excitation, as demonstrated in Ref. [18].",

The corrected data are compared to an uniformly populated phase space distribution and the models according to Refs. [8] and [18]. All theoretical models are normalized to the same total cross section as the data. The differential distributions presented here have been chosen because they are sensitive to contributions from intermediate (1232) and/or the N * (1440) resonances.

The uniform phase space distribution of the lower plot shows the strongest deviation with respect to the data due to the excitation in the data points. In contrast, no significant evidence for the presenceof the Roper resonance N * (1440) is observed in the right-hand plots of Fig. 6. Here, one would expect an enhancement around M p\u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 = 1.44 GeV/c 2 . The small deviation of the data from the solid line at about 1.5 GeV could possibly signal some small contribution from the N * (1520)D 13 resonance. However, since we are here close to the edge of the covered phase space, a solid statement on this matter can not be made. The upper left plot of Fig. 7 shows the pp-invariant mass spectrum, M pp , which behaves complementary to the M \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 spectrum in Fig. 5 and hence peaks slightly to the right with respect to the uniformly populated phase space distribution. The upper right plot shows the angular distribution of the protons in the center-of-mass frame, cos \u03b8 CM p . It exhibits an anisotropic behavior, in agreement with the theoretical calculations. The strong forward-backward peaking of the cos \u03b8 CM p spectrum is associated with \u03c0-\u03c1 exchange mediating the pp interaction. The angular distribution of the p\u03c0 0system in the center-of-mass frame, cos \u03b8 CM p\u03c0 0 , (lower right) shows a forward-backward symmetry. That is similar in shape to the cos \u03b8 CM p distribution as expected from the large p/\u03c0 0 mass ratio.",
