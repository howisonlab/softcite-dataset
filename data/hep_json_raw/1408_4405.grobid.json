In the last decades major progress in this field has been made by an interplay between new experimental results and the development of non-collinear QCD. The first information on transverse spin and transverse momentum effects have become available recently. Presently, the complete description of quarks in the nucleon includes all possible correlations between quark spin, quark transverse momentum and nucleon spin [1,2]. At leading twist, these correlations are described for each quark flavour by eight transverse momentum dependent (TMD) parton distribution functions (PDFs). After integration over transverse momentum, only three of them survive, namely the number density, the helicity and the transversity PDFs. One way to access experimentally these TMD PDFs is via semi-inclusive lepton-nucleon deep inelastic scattering (SIDIS), i.e. by studying deep-inelastic 16 Supported by EU FP7 (HadronPhysics3, Grant Agreement number 283286). 17 Supported by the Israel Science Foundation, founded by the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities. 18 Supported by the Polish NCN Grant DEC-2011/01/M/ST2/02350. 19 Deceased.",

When the target nucleon is transversely polarised, the SIDIS cross section exhibits different azimuthal modulations [3] in different combinations of the two angles \u03c6 S and \u03c6 h . These are the azimuthal angles of the initial nucleon transverse spin vector and of the produced hadron momentum in a reference system, in which the z-axis is the virtual photon direction and the x-z plane is the lepton plane according to Ref. [4]. The amplitudes of the modulations in the cross section (the so-called transverse spin asymmetries) are proportional to convolutions of TMD PDFs with TMD fragmentation functions. The two most thoroughly studied transverse spin asymmetries are the Collins and Sivers asymmetries. The Collins asymmetries allow access to the transversity PDFs coupled to the Collins fragmentation functions [5]. The Sivers asymmetries give access to the Sivers PDFs [6], which describe the correlations between quark transverse momentum and nucleon spin. A Sivers PDF always appears in combination with an 'ordinary' (unpolarised) fragmentation function that describes the fragmentation of a quark into a hadron.",

Such measurements are in line with the set of measurements done by the COMPASS Collaboration in the last years. Results on polarised deuterons were obtained for unidentified hadrons [7], pions and kaons [8], and on polarised protons for charged unidentified hadrons [9][10][11]. The results presented in this Letter are extracted from all available COMPASS data taken in 2007 and 2010 using transversely polarised protons. For the measurements in 2007 and 2010, a similar spectrometer configuration was used. As compared to the measurements on transversely polarised deuterons, the measurements on transversely polarised protons benefit from a major upgrade of the apparatus performed in 2005. Of particular relevance for these measurements is the upgrade of the RICH detector [12], which led to improved efficiency and purity for the samples of identified particles, and the use of a new target solenoid magnet with a polar angle acceptance of 180 mrad as compared to the 70 mrad of the magnet used until 2005. Measurements of these asymmetries by the HERMES experiment exist [13,14] in a different kinematic range (measurements in a limited x range also exist on neutron targets, see [15][16][17]). Comparison with these results are also presented in the paper.",

The likelihood values are computed for different mass hypotheses (L M , with M = \u03c0, K , p, e) and for the hypothesis of absence of signal, namely the so-called background hypothesis (L back ). A mass value is attributed to a track if the likelihood for the corresponding mass hypothesis is the largest. In addition, cuts on the ratio of the largest likelihood value to the second largest one are applied to minimise the misidentification probability. A specific cut on the ratio L K /L back is applied to keep the contamination of protons in the kaon sample at a few percent in the momentum range between the kaon and the proton thresholds one (about 18 GeV/c). The cuts have been tuned to improve the particle identification efficiency and the sample purity (defined as the fraction of K (\u03c0 ) inside the identified K (\u03c0 ) sample) in order to maximise their product which is the figure of merit for particle identification. The tuning has been performed on the data collected in 2007 and, thanks to the high stability of the detector, the same cuts have been applied for the 2010 data.",

The efficiencies are about  97% for pions and 94% for kaons. These values start to decrease for momenta about 30 GeV/c and reach values of 60% in the larger momentum region. In order to achieve high values of the sample purity, the misidentification probabilities between pions and kaons were kept as low as a few percent even at the largest momentum values, by adjusting the value of the cut on the ratio of the largest likelihood value to the second largest one. The purity depends also on the relative population of the various particle types and is evaluated from the particle identification efficiencies and misidentification probabilities and the number of identified kaons and pions for every bin in which the asymmetry are measured. The proton contribution is very small as already mentioned, and was neglected for the purity calculation. The average purity values for pions are above 99%. The kaon purity in the different x, z, and p h T bins is shown in Fig. 1. It is about 94% with a mostly mild dependence on the variables. The strongest dependence is visible in the large z region for the negative kaon sample, which is due to the increasing ratio of pions to kaons. Both the sample purity and the identification efficiency have been measured and found to be compatible in the two data taking years as well as in the different periods of each year. Effects due to the hadron identification using the RICH have been evaluated and found to be small with respect to the statistical uncertainties (less than half of the statistical uncertainties in the worst case, namely the last z bin). No correction has been applied to the final results and the estimates of the possible effects have been included in the systematic point-to-point uncertainties.",

Very much like in the case of unidentified hadrons, an additional absolute uncertainty of \u00b10.012 was assigned to the \u03c0 + Sivers asymmetry. No such time dependence was observed either for the other hadrons or for the Collins asymmetries. This value is taken to be half of the difference between the mean asymmetries evaluated using the data from the beginning and the end of the 2007 data taking.

The two measurements are in good agreement for the pions and for the not shown kaons. The substantial improvement of the statistical precision of the 2010 data with respect to the 2007 data amounts to a factor of 1.6 for the Collins asymmetry and of 1.9 for the Sivers asymmetry.

The pion asymmetries are very similar to the unidentified hadron asymmetries [10]: at small x they are compatible with zero, while in the valence region they show an increasing signal, which has opposite sign for \u03c0 + and \u03c0 \u2212 . This naively indicates that the unfavoured and favoured Collins fragmentation functions have opposite sign. The results for charged kaons, although with larger statistical uncertainties, show a similar trend: in particular the K + asymmetry has a negative trend with increasing x, and the K \u2212 one is positive on average. The Collins asymmetry for neutral kaons shows a positive trend with increasing z. The average asymmetry is positive but compatible with zero within the statistical uncertainty. In order to investigate in more detail the behaviour of the asymmetries as a function of z and p h T , the asymmetries for charged hadrons were evaluated in a region where the signal is different from zero, namely x > 0.032.",

            "text": "The results are shown in Fig. 7 for pions and kaons. They are in good agreement with the other existing measurements on a proton target from the HERMES experiment [13]. This is a non-obvious result, as in the last x bins the COMPASS Q 2 values are larger by a factor 3-4 than the HERMES ones. The weak Q 2 dependence of the Collins asymmetry is also supported by a recent global fit [26] of the HERMES pion results, the COMPASS preliminary pion asymmetries from the 2010 data, and the Belle [27] e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 asymmetries, which is able to provide a good description of all the data sets. A comparison between the final results of this paper and the fit is shown in Fig. 8. The Collins asymmetry for charged hadrons was further investigated by extending the standard kinematic ranges in z and y. Compared to the above presented results, the asymmetries extracted in Fig. 8. Comparison between the Collins asymmetries for pions and one of the fits in [26] (fit with standard parameterisation and fit of A 12 Belle asymmetries [27]). The preliminary asymmetries from 2010 data are included in the fit. the low-z region (0.1 < z < 0.2) gave no indication for a substantial z-dependence, neither for pions nor for kaons. Similarly, in the low-y region (0.05 < y < 0.1) the pion asymmetries do not exhibit any special behaviour, while the kaon ones suffer from too low statistics. The Sivers asymmetries measured by COMPASS for pions and kaons on transversely polarised protons are shown in Fig. 9. Also in this case, the pion asymmetries are very similar to the unidentified hadron asymmetries [11]. The asymmetries for negative pions and kaons, as well as for neutral kaons are compatible with zero, while for positive pions and kaons there is a clear evidence for a positive signal extending over the full measured x region and increasing with z. Very intriguing is the fact that, as for HER-MES [14], the K + signal is larger than the \u03c0 + one, which indicates a possibly not negligible role of sea quarks [28][29][30]. This is well visible in Fig. 10, where the two asymmetries are directly compared, and from the mean values in the x > 0.032 region, which are respectively 0.027 \u00b10.005 and 0.043 \u00b10.014. Unlike the case of the Collins asymmetry, the Sivers asymmetry measured by COM-PASS at large x for positive pions and kaons is smaller than the one from HERMES [14]. This difference is well visible also in the z and p h T variables when selecting the x > 0.032 region of the COMPASS data, as shown in Fig. 11. Several fits, which include the recently revisited Q 2 evolution, were performed using HER-MES asymmetries [14], COMPASS asymmetries on deuteron [8] and for unidentified hadrons on proton [11], and JLab Hall A asymmetries on 3 He [15,16]. In Fig. 12, the results of some of these fits [31][32][33], which employ Q 2 TMD evolutions, are shown to well reproduce the COMPASS results. It will be interesting to see the re- sults of such fits when the results presented in this Letter will be included.",

The high energy muon beam allowed the measurement of a broad kinematic range in x and Q 2 . The x, z and p T dependences of the asymmetries were studied. Further investigations extending the range in z and y were also performed. The Collins asymmetries are definitely different from zero for pions and there are hints of a non-zero signal also for kaons, although in this case the statistical significance is marginal. The Sivers asymmetries are positive for positive pions and kaons, although different in size. This result is of particular interest since it can be used to access the sea quark Sivers PDFs. The results presented in this paper provide an important input for the global analyses. Together with other measurements covering complementary kinematic ranges, they allow the study of the Q 2 dependence of the asymmetries and the quantitative extraction of the Collins FF and of the transversity and Sivers PDFs. This information is crucial for the predictions for future Drell-Yan measurements and for measurements at future high-energy electron-ion colliders.",
