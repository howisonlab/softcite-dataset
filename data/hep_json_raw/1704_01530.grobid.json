The measurement is done using 20.2 fb \u22121 of proton-proton collision data collected at a centre-of-mass energy of \u221a s = 8 TeV by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC in 2012. The measurement is based on chargedparticle track information, which is measured with excellent precision in the p T region relevant for the transition between the perturbative and the non-perturbative regimes. The data distributions are corrected for detector effects, and are found to deviate from state-of-the-art predictions in various regions of the observables.",

            "text": "A collimated spray of particles arising from a cascade of strong interactions is commonly referred to as a hadronic jet. Jet production in association with other final-state particles can constitute signal as well as an important background process in many of the precision measurements and new-physics searches conducted at CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC). A good understanding of processes initiated by strong interactions is therefore crucial. Jet production in association with a leptonically decaying heavy gauge boson (V = W, Z) allows effects of the strong interaction to be studied in a relatively clean environment. Good progress has been made in recent years towards higher-order calculations of these processes in quantum chromodynamics (QCD), e.g. fixed-order calculations of high jet multiplicities at next-to-leading order (NLO) [1,2] and the inclusive as well as V + 1-jet processes at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) [3]. Furthermore, new methods have",

If the minimum is a d ib , the i th momentum is removed from the input collection and is declared a jet. The index k defines the order of the splitting scale, with k = 0 being the last iteration step before the algorithm terminates. Hence the zeroth-order splitting scale, \u221a d 0 , corresponds to the p T of the leading k t -jet, and one can regard the N th splitting scale, \u221a d N , as the distance measure at which an N -jet event is resolved as an (N + 1)-jet event. The steps of a k t clustering sequence using three input momenta are illustrated in figure 1. In this paper, measurements of differential distributions of the splitting scales occurring in the k t clustering algorithm using charged-particle tracks in events with Z + jets are presented. The aim is to constrain the theoretical modelling of strong-interaction effects, and charged-particle tracks are used instead of calorimeter cells to reduce the systematic uncertainties of the measurements significantly. In addition to these primary results using only charged-particle information, less precise extrapolated results including neutral particles are also provided to allow comparisons to fixed-order calculations.",

The systematic uncertainties in the lepton reconstruction, identification, isolation and trigger efficiencies, as well as the lepton momentum scale and resolution, are defined in refs. [15,16]. The total impact of the lepton-based systematic uncertainties on the final results is typically 1 % or less. The uncertainty in the integrated luminosity is 1.9 %, as determined from beam separation scans [52] performed in November 2012. The difference in the pileup profile between the detector-level simulation and the data is corrected for by reweighting the simulation to match the average number of proton-proton collisions observed in the data. The impact of the remaining mismodelling on the measurement is found to be at most 1 %, which is assigned as a systematic uncertainty. The efficiency to reconstruct an ID track depends on the ID material distribution. A corresponding uncertainty is derived by comparing the nominal simulation to a dedicated simulation using a distorted ID geometry and a 15 % increase in the material budget. The resulting systematic uncertainty associated with the track reconstruction efficiency is typically at the level of 5 % but can rise to 10 % in the tails of the distributions, in particular for higher-order splitting scales. Uncertainties associated with the track momentum are found to be negligible for the range of track momenta probed in this measurement. As a cross-check, splitting scales are also constructed in data and simulation using tracks that do not pass the nominal longitudinal impact parameter requirements in order to assess the modelling of pileup and fake tracks in the simulation. Good agreement is observed between data and simulation, with the data being generally described to within 10 %. The differences are covered by the assigned uncertainties, which are larger in that region due to the larger fraction of fake and pileup tracks, and so no additional systematic uncertainties in the pileup modelling or fake-track rates are assigned.",

In the ratio plots of the lower-order splitting scales it is seen that both predictions underestimate the cross section in the peak region at values of around 3 GeV by typically 10-20 %, but are consistent with the data at 10 GeV. At higher values the MEPS@NLO prediction agrees well with the data while the NNLOPS prediction systematically overestimates the cross section. Both overshoot the data significantly in the region close to 1 GeV. The level of agreement of the NNLOPS predictions in the soft region is improved significantly for the higher-order splitting scales.",

Figure 5 displays again the first-order splitting scale, \u221a d 1 , to demonstrate the different variations in the analysis due to the choice of lepton flavour, jet-radius parameter and particle level.

This effect is most significant for low values of the lower-order splitting scales such as \u221a d 1 , where uncertainties grow beyond 10 % compared to less than 5 % in the charged-only measurement. For higher values of the splitting scales the differences between the charged-only and charged+neutral uncertainties are not as large, as this region is not affected much by hadronisation effects. The peak of the extrapolated distributions, when compared to the nominal (charged) distributions, is shifted by roughly 1 GeV in the R = 0.4 case and by about 2.5 GeV in the R = 1.0 case.
