High-energy collider experiments of the current decade should be able to find an ultimate answer to the question of their existence in a variety of models. We review these models and recent results from the Tevatron on searches for large, TeV \u22121 -size, and Randall-Sundrum extra spatial dimensions. The most dramatic consequence of low-scale (\u223c 1 TeV) quantum gravity is copious production of mini-black holes at the LHC. We discuss selected topics in the mini-black-hole phenomenology.",

            "text": "A new, string theory inspired paradigm [1] proposed by Arkani-Hamed, Dimopoulos, and Dvali (ADD) in 1998 suggested the solution to the hierarchy problem of the standard model (SM) by introducing several (n) spatial extra dimensions (ED) with the compactification radii as large as \u223c 1 mm. These large extra dimensions are introduced to solve the hierarchy problem of the SM by lowering the Planck scale to a TeV energy range. (We further refer to this fundamental Planck scale in the (4+n)-dimensional space-time as M D .) In this picture, gravity permeates the entire multidimensional space, while all the other fields are constrained to the 3D-space. Consequently, the apparent Planck scale M Pl = 1/ \u221a G N only reflects the strength of gravity from the point of view of a 3D-observer and therefore can be much higher than the fundamental (4+n)-dimensional Planck Scale. The size of large extra dimensions (R) is fixed by their number, n, and the fundamental Planck scale M D . By applying Gauss's law, one finds [1,2]: M 2 Pl = 8\u03c0M n+2 D R n . If one requires M D \u223c 1 TeV and a single extra dimension, its size has to be of the order of the radius of the solar system; however, already for two ED their size is only \u223c 1 mm; for three ED it is \u223c 1 nm, i.e., similar to the size of an atom; for larger number of ED it further decreases to subatomic sizes and reaches \u223c 1 fm for seven ED.",

            "text": "Almost simultaneously with the ADD paradigm a very different low-energy utilization of the idea of compact extra dimensions has been introduced by Dienes, Dudas, and Gherghetta [3]. In their model, additional dimension(s) of the \"natural\" EWSB size of R \u223c 1 TeV \u22121 [4] are added to the SM to allow for low-energy unification of gauge forces. In conventional SM and its popular extensions, such as supersymmetry, gauge couplings run logarithmically with energy, which is a direct consequence of the renormalization group evolution (RGE) equations. Given the values of the strong, EM, and weak couplings at low energies, all three couplings are expected to \"unify\" (i.e., reach the same strength) at the energy \u223c 10 13 TeV, know as the Grand Unification Theory (GUT) scale. However, if one allows gauge bosons responsible for strong, EM, and weak interactions to propagate in extra dimension(s), the RGE equations would change. Namely, once the energy is sufficient to excite Kaluza-Klein (KK) modes of gauge bosons (i.e., \u223c 1/R \u223c 1 TeV), running of the couplings is proportional to a certain power of energy, rather than its logarithm. Thus, the unification of all three couplings can be achieved at much lower energies than the GUT scale, possibly as low as 10-100 TeV [3]. While this model does not incorporate gravity and thus does not explain its weakness relative to other forces, it nevertheless removes another hierarchy of a comparable size -the hierarchy between the EWSB and GUT scales.",

A 3D-brane with positive tension is put at \u03d5 = 0. If gravity originates on this (Planck) brane, the wave function of the graviton has a peculiar feature that it is exponentially suppressed away from the brane in the direction of the extra dimension. If all the SM fields were confined to the Planck brane, one would not have seen any low-energy effects in this model. However, if a second (SM) brane with negative tension is put at \u03d5 = \u03c0, than the M Pl -size operators on the Planck brane would result in low-energy effects on the SM brane with the typical scale of \u039b \u03c0 = M Pl exp(\u2212k\u03c0R), where M Pl \u2261 M Pl / \u221a 8\u03c0 is the reduced Planck mass.

This observation led to an explosion of followup publications on the properties of mini-black holes produced in the lab and made this subject one of the most actively studied aspects of phenomenology of models with extra dimensions.

CDF has pioneered searches in the monophoton channel at hadron colliders [15] and also accomplished a monojet analysis [16].  Recently these results have been updated with 1-3 fb \u22121 of data collected in Run 2 in the dimuon, dielectron, diphoton, monophoton, and monojet channels [17][18][19][20][21] and also for the first time using the dijets [22]. These limits are listed in Tables 1 and 2. The tightest limits on M D come from the CDF combination of the monojet and monophoton channels and combined LEP limits. CDF limits exceed LEP limits for n \u2265 4. The tightest limits on the ultraviolet cutoff M S come from the D\u00d8 experiment in the combined ee + \u03b3\u03b3 channel.",

As discussed above, the simplest RS model is fixed by specifying just two parameters: the curvature of the AdS space k and the radius of compactification R. However, from the experimental point of view, it is more convenient to work with an equivalent set of parameters, which correspond to direct observables: M 1 , the mass of the first Kaluza-Klein excitation of the graviton, and a dimensionless parameterk = k/M Pl , which governs the coupling of the gravitons to the SM fields and hence defines the internal width of the KK gravitons. Both the CDF and D\u00d8 Collaborations used the dilepton and diphoton mass spectra and searched for a narrow resonance, which would indicate a production of the first excitation of the KK graviton. The best sensitivity comes from the 1 fb \u22121 combined D\u00d8 ee + \u03b3\u03b3 analysis [25] and 2.5 fb \u22121 CDF \u00b5\u00b5 analysis, which exclude RS gravitons with masses below 0.9, 0.7, and 0.3 TeV fork = 0.1, 0.05, and 0.01, respectively.",
