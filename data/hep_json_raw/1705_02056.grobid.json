This is a necessary condition for the cancellation of real and virtual divergences associated with such emissions, and therefore for making finite pQcd predictions. 1 Several studies using event shapes were performed in e + e \u2212 annihilations, for example, in e + e \u2212 at \u221a s =22-44 GeV, 2 pQcd calculations (combining next-to-leading-order O(\u03b1 2 s ) and next-to-leading logarithms (NLLA) precisions) were combined with data for extracting the energy dependence of \u03b1 s .

Clearly, from fitting the predictions to the data (corrected to the parton level) \u03b1 s can be determined. 3 These features allowed event shapes to be among the most studied Qcd observables, 4 both theoretically and experimentally, not only in e + e \u2212 but also in deep inelastic scattering. For example, sphericity was used at Slac (Stanford Linear Accelerator Center) to testify to the existence of jets in e + e \u2212 processes at center-of-mass energies up to 7.4 GeV. 5 Moreover, event shape variables were valuable tools which allowed the gluon discovery in processes where three prolonged jets were produced at energies up to 31.5 GeV in the center-of-mass. [6][7][8] Since, event shape variables are defined with partons and they are measured in terms of visible particles, it is possible to use them for studying corrections due to hadronization effects. 9,10 In e + e \u2212 \u2192 qq \u2192 hadrons events, the particle production is studied with respect to the (unknown) qq axis, which can be approximated by the event shape axis. Clearly, the three components of the particle momentum are required in the calculation. In contrast, at hadron colliders since the particle production originated by the hadronic matter which interacts encodes the physics of interest, the event shape axis has to be searched in the plane perpendicular to the beam axis. The radiation perpendicular to the plane formed by the main hard scattering (event shape axis) and the beam axis would be sensitive to soft physics allowing to test Qcd-inspired phenomenological models.",

This is not the case of non-perturbative Qcd, therefore, the soft regime could represent an opportunity for the discovery of new phenomena. In this regard, the study of atypical events, like the \"hedgehogs\" a observed in pp collisions at \u221a s = 1.8 TeV by the Collider Detector at Fermilab (CDF), was proposed to unveil the nature of soft particle production at the Large Hadron Collider (Lhc) energies. 17 Similar events were also reported at lower energies by the Ua1 Collaboration. 18 Clearly, \"hedgehog\" enriched samples could be easily achieved by running an event shape selection imposing a low p T threshold.",

            "text": "The study of soft physics in pp and p-Pb collisions is attractive because in high multiplicity events unexpected new collective-like phenomena were recently discovered at the Lhc. In particular, for high-multiplicity protonproton and proton-lead collisions, radial flow signals, 34,35 long-range an- gular correlations, 36,37 and the strangeness enhancement [38][39][40] have been reported. Those effects are well-known in heavy-ion collisions, where they are attributed to the existence of the sQgp. 20,41,42 Understanding the phenomena is crucial because, for heavy-ion physics, pp and p-Pb collisions have been used as the baseline (\"vacuum\") to extract the genuine sQgp effects. However, it is worth mentioning that no jet quenching effects have been found so far in p-Pb collisions, 43 suggesting that other mechanisms could also play a role in producing collective-like behavior in small collision systems. [44][45][46] The issue with the high multiplicity pp collisions is that a non-negligible part of the events may have a pQcd origin, and, it has been demonstrated that jets may play an important role in the production of the collectivelike effects observed in small systems. 21,22,47 Fortunately, the event shape analysis is a promising tool for controlling the jet bias in high multiplicity pp events. 21,22 A simulation study using inclusive pp collisions (without any selection on multiplicity) has already unveiled a difference in the particle composition when one studies the jetty-like and isotropic events, separately. For example, Fig. 5 shows the p T -integrated particle ratios (K/\u03c0, p/\u03c0 and \u03c6/\u03c0) calculated for pp collisions at \u221a s = 7 TeV using Pythia 8. 48 For p T below 2 GeV/c the ratios exhibit a depletion going from low to high S 0 , whereas, for larger p T the ratios increase with spherocity. For p T above 5-6 GeV/c the proton-to-pion ratio in high S 0 events gets more similar to that for for low S 0 . The particle ratios which involve strange hadrons deviate each other, i.e. the values for jetty-like and isotropic events, for p T >2 GeV/c. These results are compared to those where the inelastic pp interactions have a partonicp T of 6 or 30 GeV/c, being this the most energetic pQcd process within the event. The sample with 6 GeV/c jets is in a qualitatively good agreement with results for spherical events suggesting that this tool can be used to isolate the underlying event. On the other hand, the particle ratios decrease with increasing jet p T . It is worth noticing that a similar effect has been observed in the hadrochemistry measured in the so-called \"bulk\" (outside the jet peak) and the jet regions in p-Pb and Pb-Pb collisions at the Lhc. 49,50 Another potential application is related with the possibility of using the event shapes for selecting events with different number of multi-partonic interactions (MPI). 22,51  Figure 6 shows the distribution of number of MPI (N MPI ) as a function of multiplicity for non-diffractive pp collisions and for two extreme spherocity bins, S 0 < 0.2 (jetty-like) and S 0 > 0.8 (isotropic). Also shown are the results for two intervals of the leading parton transverse momentum (p T ) of the event:p T < 5 GeV and 10 <p T < 20 GeV. We observe that the average number of multi-parton interactions increases with increasing multiplicity, slightly more for isotropic events. At low multiplicity the dominant events are those of low N MPI and withp T < 5 GeV/c. On the other hand, in high multiplicity events the number of events with 10 <p T < 20 GeV is larger than that forp T < 5 GeV. In Pythia, high multiplicity events are therefore produced via hard partonic scatterings. 24 It is  worth noticing that the event is isotropic or jetty-like within the restricted \u03b7-range which is considered for the calculation of the spherocity. This suggests that when selecting isotropic events we study enriched Ue samples, while jetty-like events are those which have poor underlying event activity within the acceptance under consideration.",

            "text": "The first measurement at the Lhc on event shapes using MB events came from the Alice collaboration, which reported the average transverse sphericity as a function of the event multiplicity. Both quantities were computed at mid-pseudorapidity (|\u03b7|<0.8) using pp data at \u221a s = 0.9, 2.76 and 7 TeV. 24 The mean sphericity as a function of multiplicity was studied for different event classes selected using a cut on the maximum p T of the event (leading particle), being the \"soft\" (\"hard\") events those without (with) the leading particle having p T above 2 GeV/c. In Fig. 7, the results are presented for the aforementioned event classes along with the inclusive case (\"all\"). Like in other observables recently reported in the context of collectivity in small systems, 35,52 the average sphericity does not show dependence on \u221a s. Instead, the physics seems to be encoded in the multiplicity. For \"soft\" events the rise is significantly steeper than in \"hard\" events, however, no indication of a reduction of the average transverse sphericity is drawn at high multiplicity for inclusive and \"hard\" pp collisions. The comparison of these results with MC predictions (Pythia 6, Pythia 8 and Phojet 53 ) is quite illuminating, because as shown in Fig. 8 the MC average sphericity exhibits a reduction at high multiplicity, in inclu-  sive and \"hard\" pp collisions, whereas the sphericity in data stays constant or shows a little increase with multiplicity. In Qcd-inspired MC generators, the prime mechanism to produce high multiplicity pp collisions is related with the partonic interactions with large momentum transfer, therefore, the reduction may indicate an increase on the production of back-to-back jets. The deviation of the data from Qcd-inspired predictions can be explained in the framework of the string percolation model 54 where the area covered by the strings increases with the size (multiplicity) and energy of the system leaving less room for hard scatterings. 55 Elliptic flow has been also proposed to explain the differences observed at high multiplicity. 56 A complementary study using jets was further performed by the Cms Collaboration, supporting the findings reported by Alice. Namely, the deviations from Pythia prediction at high multiplicity could be due to an apparent reduction and softening of the jet yields. 57 The Atlas Collaboration reported a similar study but using transverse thrust, thrust minor and transverse sphericity, each defined for events having at least six charged particles (|\u03b7|<2.5 and p T >0.5 GeV/c) for the calculation of the event shape. 58 The distributions shown in Fig. 9 indicate a prevalence of spherical events in the lower leading p T intervals, and then a slight shift toward less spherical events and a broadening of the distributions  is observed for events having larger leading particle p T (>7.5 GeV/c). The different event generators (Pythia 6, 26 Pythia 8 48 and Herwing++ 29 ) which are compared with data share a similar feature, they overestimate (underestimate) the production of low (high) spherical events. Overall, the Pythia 6 tune Z1, tuned to the underlying event distributions at the Lhc, agrees the best with most of the distributions. The Pythia 6 DW tune predictions are consistently furthest from the data. This is not unexpected as DW is tuned to reproduce the Tevatron data and does not agree with the measured charged particle multiplicity and p T distributions at the Lhc. For the different event shapes studied by Atlas, the evolution toward a more spherical event shape with increasing multiplicity is rapid initially and slows at higher multiplicities.",

In this way, at high multiplicities jets and the underlying event (or maybe sQgp enhanced samples) can be analysed separately. The first attempts have been reported by the Cms Collaboration who has measured observables traditionally used to probe the sQgp formation in heavy-ion collisions. Using pp data at \u221a s = 7 TeV, the ratios: \u03a5(2S)/\u03a5(1S) and \u03a5(3S)/\u03a5(1S) have been measured as a function of the charged particle multiplicity and for different sphericity classes. 59 The ratios exhibit a reduction with increasing multiplicity, being the \u03a5(2S)/\u03a5(1S) ratios significantly higher than those for \u03a5(3S)/\u03a5(1S). Moreover, in Fig. 10 we can see their sphericity dependences which show that the ratios are systematically lower (effect of \u224840%) in spherical events than in jetty-like events. These observations resemble features of the sequential suppression of the \u03a5(nS) states observed in heavy-ion collisions. 60 So far, the results are encouraging and therefore, further studies are desirable.",

The vast amount of data has allowed to the test the pQcd predictions. Overall, a good agreement between data and theory is observed, the deviations are well understood as due to the lack of precise modelling of the matrix element calculations and parton showers. Moreover, the measured event shapes which were constructed to be less sensitive to the underlying event agree much better with the theoretical expectations.",

As shown in this review, an analysis combining event shapes and multiplicity is a potential new direction in the study of the origin of the most intriguing phenomena seen at the Lhc. Two examples were presented. The event shape distributions at high multiplicity which showed that models underestimate the amount of isotropic events and overestimate the production of jetty-like events. Suggesting that in nature soft physics may dominate at high multiplicities. On the other hand, the preliminary study using \u03a5(nS) states shows different \u03a5(2S)/\u03a5(1S) and \u03a5(3S)/\u03a5(1S) ratios for jetty-like and isotropic events. Further studies are needed to established whether or not this is connected with the sQGP formation. Finally, the Monte Carlo results presented here encourage the development of analogous analyses using data.",
