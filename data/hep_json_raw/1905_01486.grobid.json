Measurements are performed in the W \u00b1 \u2192 \u03bc \u00b1 \u03bd \u03bc channel using a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 173.4 \u00b1 6.1 nb \u22121 , collected by the CMS Collaboration at the LHC. The number of positively and negatively charged W bosons is determined separately in the muon pseudorapidity region in the laboratory frame |\u03b7 \u03bc lab | < 2.4 and transverse momentum p \u03bc T > 25 GeV/c. The W \u00b1 boson differential cross sections, muon charge asymmetry, and the ratios of W \u00b1 boson yields for the proton-going over the Pb-going beam directions are reported as a function of the muon pseudorapidity in the nucleon-nucleon centre-of-mass frame. The measurements are compared to the predictions from theoretical calculations based on parton distribution functions (PDFs) at next-to-leading-order. The results favour PDF calculations that include nuclear modifications and provide constraints on the nuclear PDF global fits.",

            "text": "The production of electroweak (EW) gauge bosons is considered to be a powerful probe of the parton distribution functions (PDFs) of the proton [1]. Most recent proton PDF sets include W and Z boson production data from the Tevatron and the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in their global fit analyses [2][3][4]. Similarly, the measurements of EW boson production in proton-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus collisions, available for the first time at centreof-mass energies of the TeV scale, provide constraints on nuclear modifications of the PDFs [5][6][7][8]. The presence of a nuclear environment modifies the parton densities in the nucleus as compared to those in a free nucleon. The nuclear PDFs (nPDFs) are expected to be enhanced for partons carrying a momentum fraction in the range 5 \u00d7 10 \u22122 x 10 \u22121 in the so-called antishadowing region, and suppressed for x 10 \u22122 in the shadowing region [9], with the modifications depending on the scale Q 2 . Because of the limited amount and type of experimental data sets available for nuclear collisions, the determination of the nuclear parton densities is less precise than for the free-proton case. As a consequence, the nPDF uncertainties are one of the main limitations of the precision E-mail address: cms -publication -committee -chair @cern .ch. of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) calculations describing hardscattering processes in nuclear collisions at high energies [7].",

            "text": "Since W bosons are predominantly produced via qq annihilation through ud \u2192 W + and du \u2192 W \u2212 processes, W boson production can be used to probe the light quark PDFs, both for the proton and nuclei. In addition, the asymmetries of the separate yields of W + and W \u2212 bosons are known to be sensitive probes of the down-to-up quark PDF ratio [10][11][12]. Consequently, their measurement may allow for the flavour decomposition of u and d quark distributions in nuclei [13]. Among the possible decay channels of the W boson, the leptonic decays are less affected by background processes than hadronic decays. Another advantage of the leptonic decays is that any possible effect due to the QCD medium produced in nuclear collisions should be negligible, since leptons are not subject to medium-induced energy loss through the strong interaction [14,15]. Studies of the W and Z boson production in PbPb collisions at a nucleon-nucleon centre-of-mass energy of \u221a s NN = 2.76 TeV, performed by the ATLAS [16][17][18] and CMS [19][20][21]  nPDF effects. A similar observation is made from the analysis of the Z boson production in pPb collisions at the same energy [23,24]. These EW boson measurements have been used for the first time in a global fit analysis of nPDF sets (EPPS16 [25]). Nevertheless, a modest enhancement of the W \u2212 boson production cross section in the most backward region (Pb-going direction) showed some difference with theoretical calculations (with and without nPDF effects), possibly pointing to different nuclear modifications of the up and down quark PDFs frame, \u03b7 CM . In order to fully exploit the information provided by the data, two additional sets of observables are also measured as functions of \u03b7 CM : the muon charge asymmetry and the muon forward-backward ratios (R FB ). The measurement of asymmetries has a couple of advantages as compared to that of the cross sections. First, asymmetries are more sensitive to modifications of the quark PDFs [7]. Second, uncertainties in the integrated luminosity and the theoretical scale dependence cancel in the measurement of these asymmetries. The results of the W \u00b1 boson differential cross sections and asymmetries are compared to perturbative QCD calculations based on NLO PDFs with and without nuclear modifications. The theoretical predictions for free protons are obtained using the CT14 [2] proton PDF set, while those including nuclear effects are derived using two different nPDF sets for lead ions: nCTEQ15 [28] and EPPS16 [25].",

Events of interest for offline analysis are selected using a trigger algorithm [31] that requires the presence of at least one muon candidate of p T > 12 GeV/c. Moreover, to enhance the signal purity [11,13], the fiducial region of the analysis has been restricted to muons of p T > 25 GeV/c with |\u03b7 \u03bc lab | < 2.4. The muon candidates are reconstructed in CMS with an algorithm that combines the information from the muon detectors and the tracker [32]. Muons are selected by applying the standard tight selection criteria described in Ref. [32]. Further, muons are required to be isolated from nearby hadronic activity to reduce the jet background. The muon isolation parameter (I \u03bc ) is defined as the p T sum of all PF-reconstructed photons, charged and neutral hadrons, in a cone of radius R = \u221a ( \u03b7) 2 + ( \u03c6) 2 = 0.3 around the muon candidate, where \u03b7 and \u03c6 are the pseudorapidity and azimuthal (in radians) distances to the muon.

The distribution of the hadronic recoil significantly contributes to the p miss T resolution.

Therefore, the correction of the simulated recoil distribution is derived in a control region of Z \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 events using a hadronic recoil technique [46,47]. The hadronic recoil of Z \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 events, u T , is defined as the vector p T sum of all PF candidates, excluding the decay products of the Z boson. The distributions of the hadronic recoil components that are parallel and perpendicular to the Z boson transverse momentum p Z T are fitted in simulation and data using a weighted sum of two Gaussian functions. The mean and resolution values extracted from the recoil fits are used to scale the simulated hadronic recoil distributions to match the performance measured in data.

The total fit model includes six contributions: the signal W \u00b1 \u2192 \u03bc \u00b1 \u03bd \u03bc template, the EW background Z/\u03b3 * \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 , W \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd \u03c4 and Z/\u03b3 * \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 templates, the tt background template, and the QCD background functional form derived from control data samples. When fitting the data, the QCD shape parameters (\u03c3 i ) are fixed to the extrapolated values, while the ratio of the EW and tt background yields to the signal yield is fixed to the results from simulation. Only two parameters are left free in the fit, the W boson signal and QCD background normalisations The simulated sample of W \u00b1 \u2192 \u03bc \u00b1 \u03bd \u03bc embedded into epos lhc is used to derive the efficiency of the muon trigger, isolation, reconstruction, and selection criteria, as a function of \u03b7 \u03bc CM . These single-muon efficiencies are also directly estimated from pPb data in a Z \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 sample using the tag-and-probe (TnP) technique, as described in Ref. [48]. The data and MC reconstruction efficiencies are observed to be consistent with each other, whereas the trigger efficiency is lower in the Z boson simulation by 5% than in data at |\u03b7 \u03bc lab | = 1.4. The muon isolation selection is found to reject fewer muons in the simulation, because of the smaller pPb UE activity compared to data. In order to correct for the differences between data and simulation, the muon efficiency computed from the W \u00b1 \u2192 \u03bc \u00b1 \u03bd \u03bc MC sample is multiplied by the TnP correction factors event-by-event.

The uncertainties on the TnP corrections are determined by propagating the uncertainties on the muon efficiencies extracted from data and simulation, derived from the fits to the invariant mass of Z \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 candidates. These uncertainties include a statistical component due to the finite size of the data sample available, as well as a systematic component estimated from variations in the fitting procedure (different signal ",

The lower panels display the data divided by the result of the fit. and background functions, and different mass range used for fitting). Additionally, uncertainties are included to account for: (1) possible differences in the reconstruction of muon tracks (0.6%), and (2) the impact of pileup and UE activity (0.3%). Another important source of systematic uncertainty arises from the modelling of the QCD multijet p miss T distribution in the signal region, which is estimated by allowing the QCD shape parameters to vary within the root-mean-square of the extrapolated values in bins of \u03b7 \u03bc CM , and by changing the p miss T model to that used in Ref. [13]. The uncertainty in the normalisation of the EW background is estimated from the nPDF uncertainty in the Z over W boson inclusive cross sections using the CT14 proton PDF and the EPPS16 nPDF for the lead ions, the uncertainty in the W and Z boson branching fractions to leptons [49], and the experimental uncertainty in the tt cross section in pPb events [50]. The uncertainty in the vector boson p T reweighing is derived from the difference of the results obtained applying and not applying the boson p T correction. The uncertainty in the binning of the p miss T MC templates is estimated by using a p miss T bin size of 1 GeV/c. The impact of EW corrections in powheg is estimated from the difference in the efficiency when computed using powheg without EW corrections [51]. The uncertainty in the p miss T recoil correction is determined by changing the model used to fit the hadronic recoil distribution and the profile of the recoil mean and resolution as a function of p Z T . Finally, the mismodelling of the UE activity in the simulation is estimated by reweighing the distribution of the track multiplicity instead of the energy deposited in the HF calorimeters. The integrated luminosity measurement uncertainty (3.5%) [27] only affects the W boson differential cross sections and cancels out in the asymmetry measurements. The maximum relative uncertainty of the differential cross sections and absolute uncertainties on the asymmetries are presented for each source of systematic uncertainty in Table 1.",
