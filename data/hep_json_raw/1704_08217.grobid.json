A decay-time dependent amplitude analysis is employed. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 3 fb \u22121 produced in 7 and 8 TeV pp collisions at the LHC, collected by the LHCb experiment. The measurement determines \u03c6 s = 119 \u00b1 107 \u00b1 34 mrad. A combination with previous LHCb measurements using similar decays into the J/\u03c8\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and J/\u03c8\u03c6(1020) final states gives \u03c6 s = 1 \u00b1 37 mrad, consistent with the Standard Model prediction.",

            "text": "Measurements of CP violation through the interference of B 0 s mixing and decay amplitudes are particularly sensitive to the presence of unseen particles or forces. The Standard Model (SM) prediction of the CP -violating phase in quark-level b \u2192 ccs transitions is very small, [1]. Although subleading corrections from penguin amplitudes are ignored in this estimate, the interpretation of the current measurements is not affected, since those subleading terms are known to be small [2][3][4] compared to the experimental precision. Initial measurements of \u03c6 s were performed at the Tevatron [5, 6], followed by LHCb measurements using both B 0 s and B 0 s decays 1 into J/\u03c8 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and J/\u03c8 K + K \u2212 , with K + K \u2212 invariant masses 2 m KK < 1.05 GeV, from 3 fb \u22121 of integrated luminosity. The measurements were found to be consistent with the SM value [7,8], as are more recent and somewhat less accurate results from the CMS [9] and 1 Whenever a flavour-specific decay is mentioned it also implies use of the charge-conjugate decay except when dealing with CP -violating quantities or other explicitly mentioned cases.",

In addition to the \u03c6(1020) meson, there are significant contributions from the f 2 (1525) resonance [15] and nonresonant S-wave, which are large enough to allow further studies of CP violation. This paper presents the first measurement of \u03c6 s using B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8 K + K \u2212 decays, where J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 with m KK above the \u03c6(1020) region, using data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3 fb \u22121 , obtained from pp collisions at the LHC. One third of the data was collected at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV, and the remainder at 8 TeV. An amplitude analysis as a function of the B 0 s proper decay time [16] is performed to determine the CPviolating phase \u03c6 s , by measuring simultaneously the CP -even and CP -odd decay amplitudes for each contributing resonance (and nonresonant S-wave), allowing the improvement of the \u03c6 s accuracy and, in addition, further studies of the resonance composition in the decay.",

Those with m KK < 1.05 GeV are called low-mass and correspond to the region of the \u03c6(1020) resonance, while those with m KK > 1.05 GeV are called high-mass. The high-mass region has not been analyzed for CP violation before, allowing the measurement of CP violation in several decay modes, including a vector-tensor final state, J/\u03c8 f 2 (1525). In the SM the phase \u03c6 s is expected to be the same in all such modes. One important difference from the previous low-mass analysis [7] is that modelling of the m KK distribution is included to distinguish different resonance and nonresonance contributions. In the previous low mass CP -violation analysis only the \u03c6(1020) resonance and an S-wave amplitude were considered. This analysis follows very closely the analyses of CP violation in B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decays [8] and in B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decays [3], and only significant changes with respect to those measurements are described in this paper. The analysis strategy is to fit the CP -even and CP -odd components in the decay width probability density functions that describe the interfering amplitudes in the particle and antiparticle decays. These fits are done as functions of the B 0 s proper decay time and in a four-dimensional phase space including the three helicity angles characterizing the decay and m KK . Flavour tagging, described below, allows us to distinguish between initial B 0 s and B 0 s states. This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the B 0 s proper-time dependent decay widths. Section 3 gives a description of the detector and the associated simulations. Section 4 contains the event selection procedure and the extracted signal yields. Section 5 shows the measurement of the proper-time resolution and efficiencies for the final state in the four-dimensional phase space. Section 6 summarizes the identification of the initial flavour of the state, a process called flavour tagging. Section 7 gives the masses and widths of resonant states that decay into K + K \u2212 , and the description of a model-independent S-wave parameterization. Section 8 describes the unbinned likelihood fit procedure used",

This approach allows the description of multidimensional correlations without assuming factorization. In practice, the sum is over a finite number of terms (a \u2264 10, b \u2264 8, \u22122 \u2264 c \u2264 2, d \u2264 8) and only coefficients with a statistical significance larger than three standard deviations (\u03c3) from zero are retained. The number of events in the simulated signal sample is about 20 times of that observed in data. Since a symmetric K + and K \u2212 efficiency is used, a and b + c must be even numbers. Projections of the efficiency integrated over other variables are shown in figure 5. The modelling functions describe well the simulated data. Since \u03c7 2 IP is not used as a variable in the selection for the two hadrons, the efficiency is quite uniform over all the four variables varying only by about \u00b110%.

Each tagging algorithm provides a tag decision and -8 - s , B 0 s , or is untagged, respectively. The fraction of candidates in the sample with a nonzero tagging decision gives the efficiency of the tagger, \u03b5 tag . The mistag probability, \u03b7, is estimated event by event, and represents the probability that the algorithm assigns a wrong tag decision to the candidate; it is calibrated using data samples of several flavour-specific B 0 , B + , B 0 s and B * 0 s2 [38] decays to obtain the corrected mistag probability, \u03c9, for an initial B 0 s meson, and separately obtain \u03c9 for an initial B 0 s meson. A linear relationship between \u03b7 and ( ) \u03c9 is used for the calibration. When candidates are tagged by both the OS and the SSK algorithms, a combined tag decision and a wrong-tag probability are given by the algorithm defined in ref. [37] and extended to include SSK tags. This combined algorithm is implemented in the overall fit. The effective tagging power is given by \u03b5 tag (1 \u2212 2\u03c9) 2 and for the combined taggers in the B 0 s \u2192 J/\u03c8 K + K \u2212 signal sample is (3.82\u00b10.13\u00b10.12)%.

Additional systematic uncertainties are evaluated by increasing the orbital angular momentum between the J/\u03c8 and the K + K \u2212 system from the lowest allowed one, which is taken as the nominal value, and varying the masses and widths of contributing resonances by their uncertainties. The largest variation among those changes is assigned as the systematic uncertainty for resonance modelling. The effect of using the m 0 in the fit, rather than following the Belle approach using m KK is evaluated by redoing the fit. This change worsens the \u22122 ln L by more than 100 units, which clearly shows the variation doesn't give a good fit; as a consequence, no systematic uncertainty is assessed.

Calibration parameters of the flavour-tagging algorithm and the B 0 s -B 0 s production asymmetry A P = (1.09 \u00b1 2.69)% [44] are fixed. The systematic uncertainties due to the calibration of the tagging parameters or the value of A P are given by the difference in quadrature between the statistical uncertainty for each physics parameter between the nominal fit and an alternative fit where the tagging parameters or A P are Gaussian-constrained by the corresponding uncertainties. Background sources are tested by varying the decay-time acceptance of the injected reflection backgrounds, changing these background yields by 5%, and also varying the \u039b 0 b lifetime. To evaluate the uncertainty of the sPlot method that requires the fit observables being uncorrelated with the variable m(J/\u03c8 K + K \u2212 ) used to obtain the sWeights, two variations are performed to obtain new sWeights, and the fit is repeated. The first consists of changing the number of | cos \u03b8 J/\u03c8 | bins. In the nominal fit, the sWeights are determined by separate fits in four | cos \u03b8 J/\u03c8 | bins for the event candidates, as significant variations of signal invariant mass resolution are seen as a function of the variable. In another variation of the analysis starting with the nominal number of | cos \u03b8 J/\u03c8 | bins the decay time dependence is explored, since the combinatorial background may have a possible variation as a function of m(J/\u03c8 K + K \u2212 ).
