The difference to top pair production is that W t production results in exactly one high-p T b-quark jet. Hence top pair events comprise the largest background in W t dilepton events, with smaller contributions for Z+jets, dibosons, and events with fake leptons. Multivariate techniques are required to separate the signal from these backgrounds, and systematic uncertainties are large. Nevertheless, the cross-section has now been measured with a relative uncertainty of 25%. The 7 TeV ATLAS analysis measures a cross-section of 16.8\u00b12.9 (stat) \u00b14.9 (syst) pb. 27 The multivariate discriminant for the CMS 8 TeV analysis is shown in Fig. 12, CMS cross-section measurement is 23.4 \u00b1 5.5 pb. 29 Both are consistent with the SM expectation.",

The t-channel final state is comprised of a lepton, neutrino and b quark from the top quark decay, a high-p T forward jet, and possibly a third jet. The main backgrounds to this signature are from W +jets and top pair production. The ratio of top to antitop quark production in the t-channel is a particularly sensitive variable because many of the experimental uncertainties cancel. ATLAS has measured this ratio in t-channel events at 7 TeV using a neural network to separate the t-channel events from the background. 30 The measured ratio is 1.81 +0. 23 \u22120.22 and is compared to several different PDFs in Fig. 13. Top cross-sections and single top CMS has measured the same ratio using 8 TeV data to be 1.76 \u00b1 0.27, again consistent with expectations. 31 The precision of these measurements is not yet sufficient to constrain PDFs, but future measurements should be able to improve on this situation. Along with the ratio, ATLAS and CMS have also measured the total t-channel cross section, with an uncertainty of 14% from ATLAS at 8 TeV 30 and an uncertainty of 9% from CMS at 7 TeV. 32",

Recent searches for Z bosons employ algorithms to identify such boosted top quark jets. 33,34 The Z mass at which such algorithms perform better than resolved algorithms that reconstruct each of the top quark decay jets individually is around 1 TeV as can be seen by the vertical dashed line in Fig. 15. The mass range probed by these searches extends up to masses of 2 TeV. The mass range below 0.75 TeV is also probed at the Tevatron where a CDF search currently provides the best sensitivity. 35 A new charged heavy boson W can decay to a top quark together with a b quark, leading to a single top final state. The W boson may have SM-like left-handed couplings or it may have right-handed couplings to the top quark and the b quark.
