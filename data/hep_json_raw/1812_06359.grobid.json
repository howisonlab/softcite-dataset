Such signatures are predicted in a number of extensions of the standard model (SM), including next-to-minimal supersymmetry and two-Higgs-doublet models with an additional scalar singlet. The results are based on a data set of proton-proton collisions corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 , accumulated with the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC in 2016 at a centre-ofmass energy of 13 TeV. No statistically significant excess is observed with respect to the SM backgrounds in the search region for pseudoscalar masses from 20 GeV to half of the Higgs boson mass. Upper limits at 95% confidence level are set on the product of the production cross section and branching fraction, \u03c3 h B(h \u2192 a 1 a 1 \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 bb), ranging from 5 to 33 fb, depending on the pseudoscalar mass. Corresponding limits on the branching fraction, assuming the SM prediction for \u03c3 h , are (1-7) \u00d7 10 \u22124 .",

So far, precise measurements of the Higgs boson spin, parity, width, and couplings in production and decay have been consistent with the expectations for the standard model (SM) Higgs boson [5][6][7][8]. However, the possibility of exotic Higgs boson decays to new lighter bosons is not excluded, and is proposed in various theories beyond the SM (BSM) [9]. The LHC combination of the SM Higgs boson measurements at 7 and 8 TeV allows Higgs boson decays to BSM states with a rate of up to 34% [7] at 95% confidence level (CL). The LHC data at 13 TeV have been used to place an upper limit of about 40% for the Higgs boson branching fraction (B) to BSM particles at 95% CL [10].",

Such decays occur in the context of the nextto-minimal supersymmetric standard model, NMSSM, and other extensions to two-Higgs-doublet models (2HDM) where the exis-E-mail address: cms -publication -committee -chair @cern .ch. tence of a scalar singlet is hypothesised (2HDM+S) [9,[22][23][24]. The 2HDM, and hence 2HDM+S, are categorised into four types depending on the interaction of SM fermions with the Higgs doublet structure [14]. All SM particles couple to the first Higgs doublet, 1 , in type I models. In type II models, which include the NMSSM, up-type quarks couple to 1 while leptons and down-type quarks couple to the second Higgs doublet, 2 . Quarks couple to 1 and leptons couple to 2 in type III models. In type IV models, leptons and up-type quarks couple to 1 , while down-type quarks couple to 2 . After electroweak symmetry breaking, the 2HDM predicts a pair of charged Higgs bosons H \u00b1 , a neutral pseudoscalar A, and two neutral scalar mass eigenstates, H and h. In the decoupling limit the lighter scalar eigenstate, h, is the observed boson with m h \u2248 125 GeV. In 2HDM+S models, a complex scalar singlet S R + i S I that has no direct Yukawa couplings is introduced. Hence, it is expected to decay to SM fermions by virtue of mixing with the Higgs sector. This mixing is small enough to preserve the SM-like nature of the h boson.",

As a benchmark, the branching fraction of h \u2192 a 1 a 1 is assumed to be 10%. The branching fractions of a 1 to SM particles depend on the type of 2HDM+S, on the pseudoscalar mass m a 1 , and on tan \u03b2, defined as the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the second and first doublets. The tan \u03b2 parameter is assumed to be 2 which implies 2B(a 1 \u2192 bb)B(a 1 \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 ) = 1.7 \u00d7 10 \u22123 for m a 1 = 30 GeV in type-III 2HDM+S [9].

The sensitivity of the search largely decreases towards m a 1 \u2248 20 GeV and lower because a 1 gets boosted and the two b quark jets tend to merge [26]. The upper bound is imposed by the Higgs boson mass. The analysis is performed using the proton-proton collision data at 13 TeV collected with the CMS detector during 2016, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 . Though the signal selection is optimised for the h \u2192 a 1 a 1 \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 bb process, decays of h \u2192 a 1 a 1 \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 can contribute to the selected sample if hadronically decaying \u03c4 leptons are misidentified as b quark jets. Such a contribution is found to be negligible using the benchmark scenario, although in some parts of the parameter space the enhancement in B(a 1 \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 ) can lead to a nonnegligible fraction of these events surviving the selection. This is taken into account in the scan over the (m a 1 , tan \u03b2) plane in the type III 2HDM+S, as for certain values, the increase in \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 signal can affect the sensitivity. The signal from a 1 a 1 \u2192 bb\u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 with \u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc leads to m \u03bc\u03bc significantly smaller than m a 1 and is not considered in the search.",

Within the solenoid volume are a silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter, and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter, each composed of a barrel and endcap sections. Forward calorimeters, made of steel and quartz-fibres, extend the pseudorapidity coverage provided by the barrel and endcap detectors. Muons are detected in gasionisation chambers embedded in the steel flux-return yoke outside the solenoid. They are measured in the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 2.4, with detection planes made using three technologies: drift tubes, cathode strip chambers, and resistive plate chambers. The efficiency to reconstruct and identify muons is greater than 96%. Matching muons to tracks measured in the silicon tracker results in a relative transverse momentum (p T ) resolution, for muons with p T up to 100 GeV, of 1% in the barrel and 3% in the endcaps [27]. A more detailed description of the CMS detector, together with a definition of the coordinate system used and the relevant kinematic variables, can be found in Ref. [28].",

            "text": "The NMSSMHET model [9] is used to generate signal samples with the Monte Carlo (MC) event generator MadGraph5_amc@nlo [29] at leading order (LO). The signal samples span the m a 1 search region in 5 GeV steps. Background processes with dominant contributions are the Drell-Yan production in association with additional b quarks and tt in the dimuon final state. Simulated samples for background processes are used in this analysis to optimise the selection and for validation purposes in those selection steps that yield reasonable statistical precision. The contribution of backgrounds to the selected sample is directly extracted from data with no reference to simulation. The Drell-Yan process, Z/\u03b3 * (\u2192 + \u2212 ) + jets with a minimum dilepton mass threshold of 10 GeV, is modelled with the same event generator at LO, exclusive in number of additional partons (up to 4). The reference cross section for the Drell-Yan process is computed using fewz 3.1 [30] at next-to-next-to-leading order. The top quark samples, tt and single top quark production, are produced with powheg2.0 [31][32][33][34] at next-to-leading order (NLO). Backgrounds from diboson (WW, WZ, ZZ) production are generated at NLO with the same program and settings as that of the Drell-Yan samples. The only exception is the WW process that is generated at LO. The set of parton distribution functions (PDFs) is NLO NNPDF3.0 for NLO samples, and LO NNPDF3.0 for LO samples [35]. For all samples, pythia 8.212 [36] with tune CUETP8M1 [37,38] is used for the modelling of the parton showering and fragmentation. The full CMS detector simulation based on Geant4 [39] is implemented for all generated event samples. In order to model the effect of additional interactions per bunch crossing (pileup), generated minimum bias events are added to the simulated samples. The number of additional interactions are scaled to agree with that observed in data [40].",

The algorithm uses the track-based lifetime information together with the secondary vertices inside the jet to provide a multivariate discriminator for the b jet identification [46].

The m \u03bc\u03bc distribution in data is used to evaluate the contribution of backgrounds. The uncertainty associated with the choice of the background model is treated in a similar way as other uncertainties for which there are nuisance parameters in the fit. The unbinned likelihood function for the signal-plus-background fit has the form L(data|s(p, m \u03bc\u03bc ) + b(m \u03bc\u03bc )), (4) where s(p, m \u03bc\u03bc ) is the parametric signal shape with the set of parameters indicated by p, and b(m \u03bc\u03bc ) is the background model. The shape for the background is modelled, independently in each category, with a set of analytic functions using the discrete profiling method [49][50][51]. In this approach the choice of the functional form of the background shape is considered as a discrete nuisance parameter, for which the best fit value can vary as the trial value of the parameter of interest (m \u03bc\u03bc ) varies. The background parameter space therefore contains multiple models, each including its own parameters.  To provide the input background models to the discrete profiling method, the data are modelled with different parametrisations of polynomials. The degrees of the polynomials are determined through statistical tests (F-test) [52] to ensure the sufficiency of number of parameters and to avoid over-fitting the data. The input background functions are tried in the minimisation of the negative logarithm of the likelihood with a penalty term added to account for the number of free parameters in the background model. The discrete profiling method can choose a different best-fit functional form for the background as the physics parameter of interest varies, thus effectively incorporating the systematic uncertainty on the background functional form: in the present analysis the result is to yield expected upper limits that are about 10% less stringent than those obtained with a single functional form for the background. The likelihood ratio for the penalised likelihood function L can be written as",

Uncertainties in signal shape and acceptance modelling: an uncertainty of 2.5% is assigned to the integrated luminosity of the CMS 13 TeV data collected in 2016 [40]. The uncertainty in the number of pileup interactions per event is estimated by varying the total inelastic ppcross section by \u00b14.6% [53]. The simulation-to-data correction factors for the trigger efficiency, muon reconstruction, and selection efficiencies are estimated using a \"tag-and-probe\" method [54] in Drell-Yan data and simulated samples. These uncertainties include the pileup dependence of the correction factors. For the jet energy scale (JES), the variations are made according to the \u03b7and p T -dependent uncertainties and propagated to the p miss T of the event. An additional uncertainty, arising from unclustered energies in the event, is assessed for p miss T . For the jet energy resolution, the smearing corrections are varied within their uncertainties [44]. Systematic uncertainty sources that affect the simulation-to-data corrections of the b tagging discriminator distribution are JES, the contaminations from light flavor (LF) jets in the b-jet sample, the contaminations from heavy flavor (HF) jets in the light-flavor jet sample, and the statistical fluctuations in data and MC. The uncertainties due to JES and light-flavor jet contamination in b-jet samples are found to be dominant [46].",

Assuming the SM cross sections for the Higgs boson production processes within the theoretical uncertainties, an upper limit is placed on B(h \u2192 a 1 a 1 \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 bb) using the same procedure. Limits are evaluated as a function of m a 1 . The observed and expected limits are illustrated in Fig. 5 for both cases. Dominant systematic uncertainties are those associated with the b jet identification, followed by the modelling of parton shower and fragmentation. For m a 1 = 40 GeV, the b tagging uncertainties arising from LF contamination and JES amount to 17 and 14%, respectively. The uncertainty arising from the parton shower and fragmentation models is about 7%. Other uncertainties are below 5%. At 95% CL, the observed upper limits on B(h \u2192 a 1 a 1 \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 bb) are (1-7) \u00d7 10 \u22124 for the mass range 20 to 62.5 GeV, whilst the expected limits are (1-3) \u00d7 10 \u22124 . A similar search from CMS in Run I [14] led to observed upper limits of (2-8) \u00d7 10 \u22124 at 95% CL, considering the ggF Higgs boson production and the mass range 25 \u2264 m a 1 \u2264 62.5 GeV. The corresponding expected limits on the branching fraction at 95% CL are (3-4) \u00d7 10 \u22124 . At 13 TeV, the ggF Higgs boson production cross section has increased by a factor of about 2.3 over that at 8 TeV, while the production cross section of main backgrounds, Drell-Yan and tt, has increased by a factor of 1.5 and 3.3, respectively. Despite the relative increase in backgrounds, better sensitivity is achieved using improved analysis techniques in Run II.

No statistically significant excess is found in data with respect to the background prediction. The results of the analysis are presented in the form of upper limits, at 95% confidence level, on the product of the Higgs boson production cross section and branching fraction, \u03c3 h B(h \u2192 a 1 a 1 \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 bb) as well as on the Higgs boson branching fraction assuming the SM prediction of \u03c3 h .
