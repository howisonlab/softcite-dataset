The changes in the mean distance from the jet axis to the jet particles, the mean kinetic energy of these particles, and the cluster dimension in response to the growth of the collision energy are consistent with the assumption that quark degrees of freedom manifest themselves in processes of pion-jet production at intermediate energies. The energy at which quark degrees of freedom begin to manifest themselves experimentally in the production of soft pion jets is estimated for the first time. The estimated value of this energy is 2.8 \u00b1 0.6 GeV. The suggestions are made for future investigations on NICA.",

            "text": "At the present time, the decision of the problem of confinement and the study of transition from meson-baryon degrees of freedom to quark-gluon ones is one of the most important (and, at the same time, most difficult) tasks of the world research programm in the field of strong interactions. The nature of confinement of color degrees of freedom (quark and gluons) and, correspondingly, the possible phase transitions in strongly interacting matter is not completely clear so far. Observation of hadron jets at high energies is one of the most important and evident experimental manifestation of quark-gluon degrees of freedom. At present, an open question is where is the low boundary on energy starting with which the color degrees of freedom should be taken into account for the description of processes of multiparticle production. Obviously, the jet structure of events displays itself more clearly at high initial energies ( \u221a s) than at intermediate ones. But in spite of this feature it seems that the application of collective characteristics of multiparticle final state can be useful in the collision energy domain \u221a s \u2243 2 \u2212 20 GeV both for the study of transition from the predominance of mesonbaryon degrees of freedom to the quark-gluon ones and for qualitative estimation of low boundary (for initial energy) experimental manifestation of quark degrees of freedom in soft jet production. In various fields of physics the onset of manifestation of new degrees of freedom and transition processes is accompanied by the presence of selfaffine and fractal properties in collective effects. Therea e-mail: VAOkorokov@mephi.ru; Okorokov@bnl.gov fore, the precise measurements of collective and geometric (fractal-like) properties of soft pion jets in the NICA energy domain can give a new important information about hadronization mechanisms, behavior of quantum systems in the nonperturbative region and transition to manifestation of quark degrees of freedom in collective phenomena.",

Figure 1 shows that, for any value of i, the dependencies G i ( \u221a s) exhibit a change in behavior in the region around \u221a s \u2243 3 GeV for all interaction types, with the exception of hA, at any value ofX, and this confirms the hypothesis put forth in [4] that dynamical interaction regimes undergo a change for The results of samples that combine the fragmentation regions are shown by dotted lines. One can see that the function in (1) agrees qualitatively with experimental data at all of theX values considered here. The parameter a 2 in (1) can be put in correspondence with the energy \u221a s c at which quark-gluon degrees of freedom begin to manifest themselves in the production of soft pion jets. The values of \u221a s c for the members of G are given in the Table 1. The estimates of \u221a s c for T k and D agree well with each other but exceed the values of \u221a s c obtained earlier in [5] on the basis of the b k ( \u221a s) dependence. This difference may be due both to physical reasons that lead to a sharper growth of T k and D in relation to b k and to a smaller size of the experimental-data samples in the case of the first two parameters. In the energy region being considered, an approximation by the function in (1) is also constructed for individual fragmentation regions. There is a substantial improvement of the quality of fits for any fragmentation region and any value ofX (\u03c7 2 /ndf \u223c 3 \u2212 5). Statistically acceptable values of \u03c7 2 /ndf could be obtained for 45% of the samples [6,7]. Numerical values found for \u221a s c from a fit to G i ( \u221a s) for \u221a s < GeV are summarized in the Table 1, the values corresponded to the fits of b k energy dependence being taken from [5]. The values of \u221a s c for the remaining two parameters from G are presented in the first lines for T k and D. Taking into account the sizes of samples of the available experimental data and the behavior of T k ( \u221a s) and D( \u221a s), we can approximate the dependencies in question by the function in (1) for \u221a s > 2 GeV. A fit was constructed both for global samples and for the regions of target and beam fragmentation. For the first case, the fitted results are shown by the dashed curves in Figs. 1c -f. For T k , agreement between the approximation by the function in (1) and experimental data is only qualitative in the case ofX = 0.1 (see Fig. 1c), since the fit quality is substantially poorer in that case than in the case ofX = 0.2 (see Fig. 1d). For D, the fit quality is indicative of only qualitative agreement between the function in (1) and experimental data at either value ofX (see Figs. 1e, f) [6,7]. In the Table 1, the values obtained for \u221a s c from a fit in the region of \u221a s > 2 GeV for global samples and for individual samples in the target-and beam fragmentation regions are given in the second rows for T k and D. The experimental results for the traditional definition of the thermal freeze-out temperature (T ) obtained for pp collisions at \u221a s \u2248 6 \u2212 18 GeV [12] agrees quite reasonably with T k ( \u221a s) at softX = 0.1 (see Fig. 1c) in both the functional behavior and the magnitude. As consequence, the thermal freeze-out temperatures [12] are some smaller than the mean \"temperatures\" of pions in jets at hard cutX = 0.2 and close energies. It should be noted T ( \u221a s) calculated within the framework of the self-similarity approach assumes the sharp decrease at \u221a s < 5 GeV and is almost flat at larger energies [13]. Such behavior of T ( \u221a s) agrees well with the features of T k ( \u221a s) (Fig. 1c, d) and confirms the hypothesis with regard to the changing of the dynamical regimes of multiparticle production at \u221a s \u223c 5 GeV [4].  of freedom in the production of soft pion jets was estimated quantitatively for the first time. The interval in which the estimates of this parameter are contained and which is matched with the results for all of the collective features under consideration from G (see Table 1  [6,7]. A universal lower boundary for the manifestation of jet geometry for final states was qualitatively estimated in [14] at \u221a s l \u223c 3 GeV for multiparticle-production processes. This value agrees with \u221a s c with allowance for the errors. Possibly, the parameters \u221a s l and \u221a s c characterize the same physical effect -the onset of experimental manifestations of quark degrees of freedom in soft processes of the multiparticle production of secondaries and, hence, a manifestation of the jet structure of the event being considered. Thus, the results obtained by using traditional and four-dimensional collective variables agree reasonably and supplement each other. and D( \u221a s) in the above range of \u221a s, we approximated by the function (2) the samples taken for T k and D and summed over the fragmentation regions. The numerical values of the fit parameters and the respective detailed discussion are presented in [6]. From Fig. 1, one can see that, for 3.5 < \u221a s < 9 GeV, the values of G i , i = 1 \u2212 3, grow faster for hA reactions than for a nucleon target. Analyzing the results obtained for T k and D in the range of \u221a s \u223c 3 \u2212 5 GeV and taking into account large statistical errors in hA data, one can extend the conclusion concerning the effect of nuclear matter on the properties of soft pion jets [3] to the whole set G. 1c, e). In view of the scantiness of the available data, we cannot rule out definitively a weak logarithmic growth for D in accordance with Eq. (2). Thus, we see that, for all i, the dependencies G i ( \u221a s) admit a universal approximation in the form (2) for a broad class of interactions at c.m. energies in the region of \u221a s > 3.5 GeV and for both X values considered in the present study.",

However in order to test the above hypothesis it would be reasonable to perform additional investigations in the range of \u221a s \u223c 2 \u2212 20 GeV. Furthermore the limited samples of experimental results for T k and D and significant errors especially for \u221a s \u223c 3 GeV allow a semi-qualitative analysis only for these observables. Therefore additional high-statistic investigations on the NICA with various beams would be important for better understanding of the dynamic and geometric features of the production of soft pion jets.",

The study of traditional collective observables at such \u221a s allows the conclusion for event shape mostly [1]. Within the approach in question, the range 10 \u22122 \u2264 b ik \u223c 1 corresponds to the transition from the domain of dominance of meson-baryon degrees of freedom to the region where the internal structure of colliding particles and, as a consequence, quark-gluon degrees of freedom become essential in the processes of secondary particle jet production 1 . The estimations for boundaries of various dynamic domains in terms of b ik seem valid for b k , i.e. when the jet axis corresponds to the \"reference\" i th particle. That is why the distributions on b k are usually studied. The approach under discussion allows the separation, at least, at qualitative level different dynamics of soft jet production. This advantage of the relativistically invariant method is important for intermediate \u221a s namely. Therefore approaches for the analysis of jet production based on traditional collective characteristics and on the set G are complementary to each other at intermediate \u221a s. Complete investigation of jet production seems important especially at NICA for the energy region which corresponds to the transition from the dominance of meson-baryon degrees of freedom to quark-gluon ones.",

In the lowest order of the renormalization group equation (RGE) the following relation was derived \u03b1 S \u221d 1/ ln b ik , where i = t / b [9,15]. The possible exact relation between b k and \u03b1 S requires an additional rigorous substantiation and careful derivation. Here one can note only that jets consist of particles with close masses (pions) in the present study and there is the relation b k = 2( M J / n J m h \u2212 1) between the geometry quantity of jet in U k space and mean invariant mass (M J ) of jet of hadrons with equal masses m h [16,17]. Here n J is the mean multiplicity of particles inside the jet, the averaging is taken over particles in the event and over events in the sample in the l.h.s.; and over event ensemble in the r.h.s. The appropriate choice of the energy scale Q in the RGE is non-trivial for hadronic processes especially in the deeply non-perturbative region. By analogy with collider experiments [18,19] M J is chosen as Q for some reaction at fixed \u221a s within the framework of the method under study. Then based on the [20] one can derive the relation",

The (3) demonstrates possible relation between soft jet characteristic b k and strong coupling and gives indications on the additional advantage for study in non-perturbative regime at NICA. The estimations M J \u223c 1\u22122 GeV obtained by the method under consideration for \u03c0p reactions at \u221a s \u223c 3 GeV [17] agree with the results at \u221a s \u223c 9 GeV [21].

The behavior of G i ( \u221a s) for all i at \u221a s \u223c 3 GeV is likely to be due to the onset of an experimental manifestation of quark degrees of freedom in the production of soft pion jets and the respective transition from the description of the processes in question in terms of baryon-meson degrees of freedom to the use of quark-gluon degrees of freedom. A lower limit on the energy at which quark degrees of freedom begin to manifest themselves in the production of soft pion jets was estimated quantitatively for the first time. The result is \u221a s c = (2.8 \u00b1 0.6) GeV. The effect of nuclear matter on the dynamical and geometric properties of soft pion jets in the 4-velocity space was found in the range of \u221a s \u223c 3 \u2212 5 GeV.",
