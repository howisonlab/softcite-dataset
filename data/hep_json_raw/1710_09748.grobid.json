The search uses a protonproton collision data sample at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV corresponding to 36.1 fb \u22121 of integrated luminosity recorded in 2015 and 2016 by the ATLAS detector at the LHC. This analysis focuses on the decays H \u00b1\u00b1 \u2192 e \u00b1 e \u00b1 , H \u00b1\u00b1 \u2192 e \u00b1 \u03bc \u00b1 and H \u00b1\u00b1 \u2192 \u03bc \u00b1 \u03bc \u00b1 , fitting the dilepton mass spectra in several exclusive signal regions. No significant evidence of a signal is observed and corresponding limits on the production cross-section and consequently a lower limit on m(H \u00b1\u00b1 ) are derived at 95% confidence level. With \u00b1 \u00b1 = e \u00b1 e \u00b1 /\u03bc \u00b1 \u03bc \u00b1 /e \u00b1 \u03bc \u00b1 , the observed lower limit on the mass of a doubly charged Higgs boson only coupling to left-handed leptons varies from 770 to 870 GeV (850 GeV expected) for B(H \u00b1\u00b1 \u2192 \u00b1 \u00b1 ) = 100% and both the expected and observed mass limits are above 450 GeV for B(H \u00b1\u00b1 \u2192 \u00b1 \u00b1 ) = 10% and any combination of partial branching ratios.",

This study resulted in the most stringent lower limits on the mass of a potential H \u00b1\u00b1 L particle. Depending on the flavour of the final-state leptons, the observed limits vary between 465 and 550 GeV assuming B(H \u00b1\u00b1 L \u2192 \u00b1 \u00b1 ) = 100%. The analysis presented in this paper extends the one described in Ref. [27] and is based on 36.1 fb \u22121 of integrated luminosity collected in 2015 and 2016 at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV.

The inner tracking detector covers the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 2.5. It is composed of silicon pixel, silicon micro-strip, and transition radiation tracking detectors. A new innermost layer of pixel detectors [30] was installed prior to the start of data taking in 2015. Lead/liquid-argon (LAr) sampling calorimeters provide electromagnetic energy measurements with high granularity. A hadronic (steel/scintillator-tile) calorimeter covers the central pseudorapidity range (|\u03b7| < 1.7). The end-cap and forward regions are instrumented with LAr calorimeters for both EM and hadronic energy measurements up to |\u03b7| = 4.9. The muon spectrometer surrounds the calorimeters and features three large air-core toroidal superconducting magnets with eight coils each. The field integral of the toroids ranges between 2 to 6 Tm across most of the detector. The muon system includes precision tracking chambers and fast detectors for triggering. A two-level trigger system is used to select events [31] that are interesting for physics analyses. The first-level trigger is implemented as part of the hardware. Subsequently a software-based high-level trigger executes algorithms similar to those used in the offline reconstruction software, reducing the event rate to about 1 kHz.",

For electrons, a significant component of fakes arises from jets which satisfy the electron reconstruction criteria and from photon conversions.

The decay width of the H \u00b1\u00b1 particle to leptons depends on the h couplings. These were set to the value h = 0.02 in all Pythia 8.186 samples. This setting corresponds to a decay width that is negligible compared to the detector resolution. The h \u03c4 and h \u03c4 \u03c4 couplings were fixed at zero. There are 23 MC samples with different H \u00b1\u00b1 particle masses, starting from 200 GeV up to 1300 GeV in steps of 50 GeV.

The emitted photon can either convert to an electron-positron pair, which happens in most of the cases, or traverse the inner detector without creating any track. In the first case, the cluster corresponding to the initial electron can be matched to the wrong-charge track, or most of the energy is transferred from one track to the other because of the photon. In case of photon emission without subsequent pair production, the electron track has usually very few hits only in the silicon pixel layers, and thus a short lever arm on its curvature. Because the electron charge is derived from the track curvature, it could be incorrectly determined while the electron energy is likely appropriate as the emitted photon deposits all of its energy in the EM calorimeter as well. For a similar reason high-energy electrons are more often affected by charge misidentification, as their tracks are approximately straight and therefore challenging for the curvature measurement. The modelling of charge misidentification in simulation deviates from data due to the complex processes involved, which particularly rely on a very precise description of the detector material. A correction is obtained by comparing the charge misidentification probability measured in data to the one in simulation. The charge misidentification probability is extracted by performing a likelihood fit on a dedicated Z \u2192 ee data sample (see ",

[27]. The b-jet veto significantly reduces fake leptons from heavy-flavour decays. Most of the fake leptons still passing the analysis selection originate from inflight decays of mesons inside jets, jets misreconstructed as electrons, and conversions of initial-and final-state radiation photons. The fake factor method provides an estimation of events with fake leptons in analysis regions by extrapolating the yields from the so-called 'side-band regions'. For each analysis region a corresponding side-band region is defined. It requires exactly the same selection and lepton multiplicity except that at least one lepton must fail to satisfy the tight identification criteria. The ratio of tight to loose leptons is measured in dedicated 'fake-enriched regions'. It is determined as a function of lepton flavour, p T , and \u03b7, and referred to as the 'fake factor' (F( p T , \u03b7, flavour)). It describes the probability for a fake lepton to be identified as a tight lepton. The definitions of the fake-enriched regions for the electron and muon channels are reported in Table 4. In the measurement of the fake factor, a requirement on the unbalanced momentum in the transverse plane of the event, Table 4 Selection criteria defining the fake-enriched regions used to measure the ratio of the numbers of tight and loose leptons, the so-called fake factor, for the electron and muon channels E miss T , is imposed to reject W + jets events and to further enrich the regions with fake leptons. The fake factor method relies on the assumption that no prompt leptons appear in the fake-enriched samples. This assumption is not fully correct with the imposed selection. Therefore, the number of residual prompt leptons in the fake-enriched regions is estimated using simulation and subtracted from the numbers of tight and loose leptons used to measure the fake factors.",

These correspond to experimental and theoretical sources affecting both background and signal predictions. All considered sources of systematic uncertainty affect the total event yield, and all except the uncertainties on the The cross-sections used to normalise the simulated samples are varied to account for the scale and PDF uncertainties in the cross-section calculation. The variation is 6% for diboson production [77], 13% for tt W production, 12% for tt Z production, and 8% for tt H production [49]. The theoretical uncertainty in the Drell-Yan background is estimated by PDF eigenvector variations of the nominal PDF set, variations of PDF scale, \u03b1 S , electroweak corrections, and photon-induced corrections. The effect of the PDF choice is considered by comparing the nominal PDF set to several others, namely CT10NNLO [62], MMHT14 [78], NNPDF3.0 [43], ABM12 [79], HERAPDF2.0 [80,81], and JR14 [82]. An envelope is constructed by taking into account the largest deviations from the nominal choice. The predominant prompt background, arising from diboson production, is assigned an additional theoretical uncertainty by comparing the nominal Sherpa 2.2.1 prediction with the Powheg prediction. This uncertainty varies from 5 to 10%. Furthermore, the theoretical uncertainty in the NLO cross-section for pp \u2192 H ++ H \u2212\u2212 is reported to be about 15% [9]. It includes the renormalization and factorization scale dependence and the uncertainty in the parton densities. Lastly, the theoretical uncertainty in the simulated pp \u2192 H ++ H \u2212\u2212 events is assessed by varying the A14 parameter set in Pythia 8.186 and choosing alternative PDFs CTEQ6L1 and CT09MC1 [83]. The impact on the signal acceptance is found to be negligible.   Fig. 6 Relative uncertainties in the total background yield estimation after the fit. 'Stat. Unc.' corresponds to reducible and irreducible background statistical uncertainties. 'Yield fit' corresponds to the uncertainty arising from fitting the yield of diboson and Drell-Yan backgrounds. 'Lumi' corresponds to the uncertainty in the luminosity. 'Theory' indicates the theoretical uncertainty in the physics model used for simulation (e.g. cross-sections). 'Exp.' indicates the uncertainty in the simulation of electron and muon efficiencies (e.g. trigger, identification). 'Fakes' is the uncertainty associated with the model of the fake background. Individual uncertainties can be correlated, and do not necessarily add in quadrature to the total background uncertainty, which is indicated by 'Total Unc.' A significant contribution arises from the statistical uncertainty in the MC samples and data sideband regions. Analysis regions have a very restrictive selection and only a small fraction of the initially generated MC events remains after applying all requirements. The statistical uncertainty varies from 5 to 40% depending on the signal region.",

Two-and four-lepton signal regions are presented in Fig. 8 and three-lepton signal regions are presented in Fig. 9. In the four-lepton signal region only one data event is observed. It is an e + \u03bc + e \u2212 \u03bc \u2212 event with invariant masses of 228 and 207 GeV for the same-charge lepton pairs.

For B(H \u00b1\u00b1 \u2192 \u00b1 \u00b1 ) = 100% the production cross-section is excluded down to 0.1 fb, corresponding to 3-4 signal events, which is the theoretical limit of a 95% CL exclusion. Some representative cross-section upper limits as a function of the H \u00b1\u00b1 boson mass are presented in Fig. 10, for different combinations of the branching ratios for decay into light-lepton pairs. The final result of the fit is a lower limit on the twodimensional grid of the H \u00b1\u00b1 boson mass for any combination of light lepton branching ratios that sum to a certain value. The fit was performed for values of B(H \u00b1\u00b1 \u2192 \u00b1 \u00b1 ) from 1% to 5% in 1% intervals, and from 10% to 100% in 10% intervals.

The minimum limit is obtained by taking, for each value of B(H \u00b1\u00b1 \u2192 \u00b1 \u00b1 ), the least stringent limit for any combination of branching ratios that sum to B(H \u00b1\u00b1 \u2192 \u00b1 \u00b1 ).

The search was performed with 36.1 fb \u22121 of data from proton proton collisions at \u221a s = 13 TeV, recorded during the 2015 and 2016 data-taking periods. No significant excess above the Standard Model prediction was found. As a result of the search, lower limits are set on the mass of doubly-charged Higgs bosons. These vary between 770 and 870 GeV for the H \u00b1\u00b1 L mass and for B(H \u00b1\u00b1 \u2192 \u00b1 \u00b1 ) = 100% and above 450 GeV for B(H \u00b1\u00b1 \u2192 \u00b1 \u00b1 ) \u2265 10% for any combination of partial branching ratios.
