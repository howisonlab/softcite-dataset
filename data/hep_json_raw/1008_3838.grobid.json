A PWA of the data sample taken during a COMPASS pilot run in 2004 on a Pb target showed a significant spin-exotic J P C = 1 \u2212+ resonance consistent with the controversial \u03c0 1 (1600), which is considered to be a candidate for a non-qq mesonic state. In 2008 COMPASS collected a large diffractive \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 data sample using a hydrogen target. A first comparison with the 2004 data shows a strong target dependence of the production strength of states with spin projections M = 0 and 1.",

It is a two-stage spectrometer that covers a wide range of scattering angles and particle momenta with high angular resolution. The target is surrounded by a Recoil Proton Detector (RPD) that measures the time of flight of the recoil protons. COMPASS uses the M2 beamline which can deliver secondary hadron beams with a momentum of up to 300 GeV/c and a maximum intensity of 5 \u2022 10 7 sec \u22121 . The negative hadron beam consists of 96.0 % \u03c0 \u2212 and 3.5 % K \u2212 . Two ChErenkov Differential counters with Achromatic Ring focus (CEDAR) upstream of the target are used to identify the incoming beam particles.",

In these events the beam pion is excited to some resonance X \u2212 via t-channel Reggeon exchange with the target. At 190 GeV/c the process is dominated by Pomeron exchange. Diffractive reactions are known to exhibit a rich spectrum of produced states and are characterized by two kinematic variables: the square of the total center-of-mass energy and the squared four-momentum transfer  from the incoming beam particle to the target, t = (p beam \u2212 p X ) 2 . It is customary to use the variable t = |t| \u2212 |t| min instead of t, where |t| min is the minimum value of |t| allowed by kinematics.",

            "text": "In 2004 the trigger selected one incoming and at least two outgoing charged particles, whereas in 2008 a signal from the recoil proton was required in the RPD. In the offline event selection diffractive events were enriched by an exclusivity cut of \u00b14 GeV around the nominal beam energy. The t region between 0.1 and 1.0 (GeV/c) 2 was selected for the analysis (see Fig. 1). Figure 2 shows the \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 invariant mass distribution of the selected 2008 data sample. It exhibits clear structures in the mass regions of the well-known resonances a 1 (1260), a 2 (1320), and \u03c0 2 (1670). In order to find and disentangle the various resonances in the data, a PWA was performed, in which the total cross section was assumed to factorize into a resonance and a recoil vertex. The isobar model 3 is used to decompose the decay X \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 into a chain of successive two-body decays: The X \u2212 with quantum numbers J P C and spin projection M decays into a di-pion resonance, the so-called isobar, and a bachelor pion. The isobar has spin S and a relative orbital angular momentum L with respect to \u03c0 \u2212 bachelor . A partial wave is thus defined by J P C M [isobar]L, where = \u00b11 is the reflectivity 2 . The production amplitudes are determined by extended maximum likelihood fits performed in 40 MeV/c 2 wide bins of the three-pion invariant mass m X . In these fits no assumption is made on the produced resonances X \u2212 other then that their production strengths are constant within a m X bin. The PWA model includes five \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 isobars 4 : \u03c0\u03c0 s-wave, \u03c1(770), f 0 (980), f 2 (1270), and \u03c1 3 (1690). It consists of 41 partial waves with J \u2264 4 and M \u2264 1 plus one incoherent isotropic background wave. In order to describe the data, mostly positive reflectivity waves are needed. This corresponds to production with natural parity exchange.",

A first comparison of the 2008 H 2 data with the 2004 Pb data without acceptance corrections shows a surprisingly large dependence on the target material.
