            "text": "Now that \u03b8 13 is known to be large, a medium baseline reactor experiment can observe the fine structure of the electron antineutrino survival probability curve, approximately periodic oscillations in L/E with wavelength 4\u03c0/|\u2206M 2 31 |. The periodicity with respect to L/E is broken by 2-3 oscillations which, in the case of the normal (inverted) hierarchy, shift the first 16 oscillations nearly 1% higher (lower) and move the next 16 lower (higher). The energy of each peak determines a particular combination of the mass differences, for example cos 2 (\u03b8 12 )|\u2206M 2 31 | + sin 2 (\u03b8 12 )|\u2206M 2 32 | for all peaks visible at baselines under 40 km. Comparing these combinations with each other or with NO\u03bdA results one can in principle determine the mass hierarchy. Alternately, as the Fourier transforms of the 1-3 and 2-3 oscillation probabilities are out of phase by the 1-2 oscillation probability, near the maximum of the 1-2 oscillation the complex phase of the total survival probability can be used to determine the hierarchy. Two interference effects make this task difficult. First, kilometer distances between the reactors reduce the amplitudes of peaks below about 4 MeV. Second, even reactors 100 or more kilometers away significantly obscure the 1-2 oscillation maximum, which also complicates a measurement of the solar mixing angle with a single detector.",

It is now known that \u2206M 2 21 \u223c 7.5 \u00d7 10 \u22125 eV 2 [2], implying that the difference between the normal and inverted hierarchies cannot be seen at a baseline below about 40 km. The low fluxes at these long baselines led various groups [3,4] to conclude that the individual peaks in the neutrino spectrum would be difficult to resolve, and so the only hope for a hierarchy determination would be to sum them via a Fourier transform. Even in this case the necessary detectors were extremely large and the experiments slow.",

[3,4]. The larger mixing angle increases the sizes of the oscillations used to determine the hierarchy by an order of magnitude. This means both that a reactor experiment to determine the hierarchy is now practical and also that the analysis of the optimal baseline and experimental configuration must now be redone.

The optimal analysis will be a combination of the old and the new to be determined by simulations. We will also discuss problems which have so far escaped attention in the literature. In the second paper [12] we discuss the spurious dependence, first observed in Ref. [13], of the parameters of Ref.

            "text": "A central theme in these papers will be the observation that, since reactors are typically separated by of order 1 km in a reactor array, the baselines of neutrinos from different reactors are different. As a result the oscillations of low energy neutrinos, which perform half an oscillation while traveling from one reactor to the next, will be invisible at the detector as the neutrinos from one reactor arrive at the oscillation maximum while the other is at its minimum. We will show that, due to a degeneracy between the hierarchy and a mass difference, a determination of the neutrino mass hierarchy is impossible in an experiment which cannot resolve these low energy peaks. Thus the angle between the detector and the lines extending between reactors is an essential variable in the determination of the optimal detector location. For example, for a linear array of reactors like RENO or Daya Bay plus Ling Ao, this effect can be eliminated if the detector is placed orthogonal to the array.",

However the flux from a distant reactor at the 1-2 oscillation minimum of 120 km will dominate over the flux from the near reactor in this region. In fact, this will be the case for a detector placed 60 km away from Daya Bay and Ling Ao in the orthogonal direction, as the proposed Haifeng and Huizhou reactors will be near the 1-2 minimum. Also if a detector is placed equidistant from Daya Bay and Haifeng or Huizhou at the position suggested in Ref. [9] or [11] then the 1-2 maximum neutrinos from Daya Bay and Haifeng or Huizhou will correspond to the 1-2 minimum for neutrinos from the proposed reactor at Lufeng [11]. This not only makes the determination of the hierarchy more difficult, but also is detrimental to the sensitivity to \u03b8 12 . The ideal solution to this problem is to use two detectors at different distances, say 40 and 70 km. However a more economical solution is to keep the baselines short so that the flux from the desired reactor complex dominates over the fluxes from others, for example one can consider a baseline of 45-50 km.",

We describe the interference between the 1-3 and 2-3 oscillations [1] which leads to beats at the 1-2 frequency and we numerically find the energies of the combined peaks. Then in Sec. 3 we describe how the positions of various peaks can be used to obtain combinations of the neutrino mass differences. The position of the nth peak determines its own combination \u2206M 2 (n) . We will see that, as the first 10 peaks all determine the same mass combination, they do not allow a determination of the mass hierarchy, but the next 5 do, which is why short baselines are not sufficient for a determination of the hierarchy. In Sec. 4 we discuss the consequences of the finite energy resolution and the finite neutrino flux. Both provide obstacles to locating the n > 10 peaks, and so to a determination the hierarchy. In Sec. 5 we discuss analyses of the Fourier transform of the neutrino spectrum. These have the advantage that, when the nonlinearity of the detector response is well understood, they sum the peaks together, and so render the signal stronger. We rederive three old ways in which the hierarchy can be determined from this transformed spectrum and add two new methods to the list.",

The distances may differ by of order a kilometer because the individual reactors in an array are not coincident, leading to an interference effect which greatly diminishes the amplitudes of the low energy, high n, peaks. We will see that this interference can be avoided if the detector is placed perpendicular to the array. Also, while it has long been known [3] that neutrinos from reactors at the 1-2 oscillation maximum baseline are the most useful for determining the hierarchy, we will see that this signal can be overwhelmed by neutrinos from distant reactors at the 1-2 minimum, and we will argue that this is indeed the case if a detector is placed at the 1-2 maximum orthogonal to the Daya Bay, Ling Ao reactor array. This problem, as well as the related error in a determination of \u03b8 12 , can be reduced by shortening the baseline or, if possible, adding another detector at a different baseline.",

For neutrinos with between 2 and 7.5 MeV, which will be the ones of interest in this note, it was shown in Ref. [21] that a quadratic (m = 3) fit tends to introduce errors of order 2-3% whereas a 6 parameter (m = 6) fit introduces errors of order 1%, well below the error in the theoretical flux. The differences between these parameterizations are oscillations over a characteristic scale of 1-2 MeV, which are likely too broad to give a false signal for a 1-3 oscillation peak, but may well disguise the depth of 1-2 oscillations and so affect the measured value of \u03b8 12 .",

            "text": "Although the energies of peaks in Fig. 3 are strongly dependent upon the hierarchy at every baseline, this does not mean that a measurement of the spectra can actually allow one to determine the hierarchy. The problem, as was discovered in Ref. [15] in this context and as we will describe in Sec. 2, is that the energies of the first 10 or so peaks only determine the mass difference \u2206M 2 ef f of Eq (2.16), leaving the hierarchy degenerate with |\u2206M 2 31 |. Thus if the baseline is short enough so that only these peaks may be reliably measured, then there will be a value of \u2206M 2 ef f that reproduces the peaks for both hierarchies, as seen at 40 km in the first panel of Fig. 4. Here the peak n = 6 can barely be seen at 6.6 MeV, whereas n = 7 at 5.7 MeV is clearly discernible. The largest peaks are n = 8, 9, 10, and 11. However the energies of these peaks are independent of the hierarchy at constant \u2206M 2 ef f . The hierarchy-dependence becomes somewhat larger at the 12th peak, which is located at about 3.32 MeV in the case of the normal hierarchy and 3.30 MeV in the case of the inverted hierarchy. Thus if \u2206M 2 ef f peaks can be determined at better than 1% from the low n peaks and then the location of the 12th peak can be determined with a precision of better than 1%, a determination of the hierarchy would be barely possible. The lower energy peaks are smaller, but more hierarchy dependent. For example, the 16th peak would be at 2.50 MeV with the normal hierarchy, but 2.46 MeV with the inverted hierarchy. This 2% difference is just within the resolution of the proposed detectors of Refs. [4,9,11], and so when combined with an accurate measurement of \u2206M 2 ef f one could potentially determine the hierarchy at the 1-2\u03c3 level.",

In the case of the Daya Bay and Ling Ao complex, in the case of RENO and somewhat trivially in the case of Double Chooz this is possible as all of the reactors essentially lie along a line. It means however that such a detector will not be equidistant from any reactor that may eventually be built at Haifeng or Huizhou, thus reducing the neutrino fluxes assumed in Refs. [4,9,11] by a factor of 2. Worse yet, the Haifeng and Huizhou reactors then provide a strong and undesirable background, as will be described in Subsec. 6.2. provides an ideal baseline to determine the mass hierarchy for a number of reasons. Among these is that while the P 13 + P 23 oscillation amplitude of (cos 2 (\u03b8 12 ) \u2212 sin 2 (\u03b8 12 ))sin 2 (2\u03b8 13 ) is a factor of 3 less than its amplitude sin 2 (2\u03b8 13 ) at the 1-2 maxima, the flux remaining after 1-2 oscillations is also smaller by a factor of 1/(1 \u2212 sin 2 (\u03b8 12 )cos 4 (\u03b8 13 )) which is about 5. Thus the 1-3 oscillations are a larger fraction of the total flux, making them easier to see above systematic errors, although not above statistical errors as 3 > \u221a 5.",

In particular this means that the first 10 peaks alone cannot be used to determine the hierarchy, as they are fit equally well by the wrong hierarchy model in which this mass difference is preserved. On the other hand we found that the positions of the next 10 peaks depend on distinct combinations of the mass differences, and so combining the energies at different peaks with some beyond the 10th can lead to a determination of the hierarchy. We also estimated the detector resolution and neutrino flux which are needed for such a goal, although an accurate determination will be left for the simulations to be discussed in our companion paper.",

We have analyzed the Fourier transform of the spectrum, deriving the phenomenological hierarchy indicators proposed in Refs. [3,4] and providing a new indicator, the complex phase at the peak of the Fourier transform, which we claim will be positive for the normal hierarchy and negative for the inverse hierarchy. We also propose a new hierarchy-dependent nonlinear Fourier transform which will lead to a higher peak using the transform corresponding to the correct hierarchy. Our simulations show that an analysis which combines the linear and nonlinear transform methods is able to identify the hierarchy considerably more reliably than one which relies entirely upon the linear transform.",

If the energy spectrum is shifted, this simply leads to an overall phase in the Fourier transform which does not seriously affect the analysis. Likewise a uniform stretching of the spectrum simply shifts the peaks, which does not affect the determination of the hierarchy at all. Any nonlinearity however poses a much more serious problem, as it can lead to an interference between the peaks in the spectrum which mutates or destroys the peak structure of the Fourier transform. If the nature of the nonlinearity is known then one can adjust the analysis to correct for it [26] however if the nonlinearity is known it could be corrected directly in the reading of the energy. In general the nonlinearity of the response is only known at energies where the detector has been calibrated with radioactive sources. It may therefore be desirable to modify the Fourier transform so as to weigh the more reliable energies more heavily. One may also wish to weigh the energies near the 1-2 maximum more heavily, as they contribute few neutrinos but are indispensable in a determination of the hierarchy. These weights can be optimized by testing various hierarchy determination algorithms against simulated data.",

First of all, reactors in the same array are generally separated by distances of order 1 km, which means that neutrinos arriving at a detector from one reactor at a 1-3 maximum may be at the same energy as those arriving from another at a 1-3 minimum. The result is that the 1-3 oscillation signal can be severely reduced at the low energies in which this oscillation can occur within a reactor complex. These are just the low energies which are necessary for the determination of the hierarchy, and so this interference poses a serious problem.
