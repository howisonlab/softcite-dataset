Comparing the expected number of background events with the data sample after applying the selection criteria, we do not find evidence for a signal. The resulting upper limit, at the 90% confidence level, is B(B + \u2192 K + \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 )< 2.25 \u00d7 10 \u22123 .",

This decay is forbidden at tree level and only occurs, at lowest order, via one-loop diagrams. The SM contributions, shown in Fig. 1, include the electromagnetic penguin, the Z penguin, and the W + W \u2212 box diagrams. Rare semi-leptonic B decays such as B + \u2192 K + \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 can provide a stringent test of the SM and a fertile ground for new physics searches. Virtual particles can enter in the loop and thus allow to probe, at relatively low energies, new physics at large mass scales. Measurements of the related decays, B + \u2192 K + + \u2212 where = e or \u00b5, have been previously published by BABAR [4] and other experiments [5]- [8], and exhibit some discrepancy with the SM expectation [9].",

An important potential contribution to this decay is from neutral Higgs boson couplings, where the lepton-lepton-Higgs vertices are proportional to the mass squared of the lepton [11]. Thus, in the case of the \u03c4 , such contributions can be significant and could alter the total decay rate. Additional sources of new physics and their effect on the B + \u2192 K + \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 branching fraction and the kinematic distributions of the \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 pair are also discussed in Refs.

The detector response is simulated using GEANT4 [28]. Signal MC events are generated as \u03a5 (4S) \u2192 B + B \u2212 , where one B decays according to its measured SM branching fractions [29] and the other B decays via B + \u2192 K + \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 according to the model described in Ref. [30]. Within this model, referred to as LCSR, a light-cone sum rule approach is used to determine the form factors that enter into the parameterization of the matrix elements describing this decay. Signal events are also reweighted to a model based on the unquenched lattice QCD calculations of the B \u2192 K + \u2212 form factors [2] for the determination of the signal efficiency, and the two theoretical approaches are then compared to evaluate the model-dependence of our measurement. Because of the low efficiency of the hadronic B tag reconstruction, \"dedicated\" signal MC samples are also generated for this analysis, where one B decays exclusively through B \u00b1 \u2192 D 0 \u03c0 \u00b1 , D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + while the other B meson decays via the signal channel. This ensures that more events pass the hadronic B tag reconstruction and allows for increased statistics in the distributions of discriminating variables in the signal sample. Only variables that are independent of the B tag decay mode are considered with the dedicated signal MC sample. To avoid potential bias, this dedicated sample is not used to evaluate the final signal selection efficiency. Back-ground MC samples consist of B + B \u2212 and B 0 B 0 decays and continuum events, e + e \u2212 \u2192 ff , where f is a lepton or a quark.

A signal selection is then applied on the charged tracks and neutral clusters that are not used in the B tag reconstruction. B + \u2192 K + \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 candidates are required to possess exactly three charged tracks satisfying particle identification (PID) requirements consistent with one charged K and an e + e \u2212 , \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 , or e + \u00b5 \u2212 pair. The PID selection algorithms for charged tracks are based on multivariate analysis techniques that use information from the BABAR detector subsystems [25]. The K \u00b1 is required to have a charge opposite to that of B tag . Furthermore, events with 3.00 < m + \u2212 < 3.19 GeV/c 2 are discarded to remove backgrounds with a J/\u03c8 resonance.

Moreover, events with \u03b3 \u2192 e + e \u2212 are removed by requiring the invariant mass of each electron with any other oppositely charged track in the event to be greater than 50 MeV/c 2 . Background events with \u03c0 0 candidates, reconstructed from a pair of photons with individual energies greater than 50 MeV, a total CM energy greater than 100 MeV, and an invariant mass ranging between 100 and 160 MeV/c 2 , are rejected.

The determination of the B tag yield correction is anti-correlated with the extrapolation of the combinatorial background from the m ES sideband, as both use the combinatorial background shape from MC. Therefore, only one systematic uncertainty on the B tag yield and combinatorial background estimate is evaluated, using a simulated MC sample composed of background events with the same luminosity as the data sample. Accounting for the anti-correlation, the effect of varying the value of the B tag yield correction on the final signal efficiency and background estimate is determined to be 1.2% and 1.6%, respectively. The uncertainty associated with the theoretical model is evaluated by reweighting the s B distribution of the dedicated signal MC sample to the LCSR [30] theoretical model and to that of Ref.

The resonant B \u2192 K + \u03c8(2S),\u03c8(2S) \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 decay has a negligible background contribution and thus only non-resonant models are used to estimate the theoretical uncertainty, especially since the kinematics of any new physics sources are not well-known.

Other potential sources of systematic uncertainties have been investigated, including those associated with the assumption that charged and neutral B candidates are produced at equal rates, the continuum likelihood suppression, B tag purity, track multiplicity, E miss and s B selection criteria, and are all implicitly accounted for in the B tag yield correction uncertainty.

The yields in the e + e \u2212 and \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 channels show consistency with the expected background estimate. The signal yield in the e + \u00b5 \u2212 channel is approximately equal to the sum of the other two channels, since it also includes the charge conjugate decay with e \u2212 \u00b5 + in the final state. We observe 40 e + \u00b5 \u2212 and 52 e \u2212 \u00b5 + events in this channel, which corresponds to an excess of 3.7\u03c3 over the background expectation. Examination of kinematic distributions in the e + \u00b5 \u2212 channel does not give any clear indication either of signallike behavior or of systematic problems with background modeling. When combined with the e + e \u2212 and \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 modes, the overall significance of the B + \u2192 K + \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 signal is less than 2\u03c3, and hence we do not interpret this as evidence of signal. If the excess is interpreted as signal, the branching fraction for the combined three modes is B(B + \u2192 K + \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 )=(1.31 +0.66 \u22120.61 (stat.) +0.35 \u22120.25 (sys.)) \u00d7 10 \u22123 . The upper limit at the 90% confidence level is B(B + \u2192 K + \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 )< 2.25 \u00d7 10 \u22123 .",
