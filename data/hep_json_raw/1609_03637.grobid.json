            "text": "1. Introduction The rare decay K L \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03bd\u03bd of the long-lived neutral kaon is a direct CP-violating process [1,2], and is one of the most sensitive probes to search for new physics beyond the standard model (SM) of particle physics. Because this decay proceeds through the flavor-changing neutral current via the s \u2192 d transition, it is strongly suppressed in the SM and is sensitive to new heavy particles contributing to the decay [3,4]. The SM predicts the branching fraction (Br) to be (3.00 \u00b1 0.30) \u00d7 10 \u221211 [5], while the current experimental upper limit is 2.6 \u00d7 10 \u22128 at the 90% confidence level (C.L.) set by the KEK E391a experiment [6]. The BNL E949 experiment [7] has set an indirect and model-independent limit Br(K L \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03bd\u03bd) < 1.46 \u00d7 10 \u22129 based on the measurement of the K + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03bd\u03bd branching fraction [8].",

Two photons from a \u03c0 0 decay were detected by the electromagnetic calorimeter, which consisted of 2716 undoped CsI crystals, stacked inside a 1.9-m-diameter cylinder except for the central 20\u00d720 cm 2 region. The size of each crystal within (outside) the central 1.2\u00d71.2 m 2 region was 2.5\u00d72.5 cm 2 (5.0\u00d75.0 cm 2 ) in cross section and 50 cm in length, which corresponded to 27 radiation lengths in the beam direction. The energy resolution of the calorimeter was evaluated as \u03c3 E /E = (0.99 \u2295 1.74/ \u221a E)%, where \u2295 indicates a quadratic sum, and E is in GeV [18]. Details of the calorimeter are described in Refs. [19,20]. Subsystems other than the calorimeter in the KOTO detector were \"veto counters,\" which ensured that no other detectable particles were emitted in the K L decay. The gaps between the cylinder and the crystals of the calorimeter were filled with lead-scintillator sandwich counters named OEV [21]. The beam hole of 15 \u00d7 15 cm 2 was located at the center of the calorimeter to let the beam particles pass through. The hole was surrounded with counters named LCV and CC03, which were composed of plastic scintillator plates and CsI crystals, respectively. The upstream surface of the calorimeter was covered with the Charged Veto (CV) counter [22], consisting of two layers of 3-m-thick plastic scintillator sheets, to veto the K L decays with charged particles. The outside region of the decay volume was surrounded by the Main Barrel (MB) [23]. The MB was a sandwich-type shower counter with lead and plastic scintillator sheets, and detected extra particles from the K L \u2192 3\u03c0 0 and K L \u2192 2\u03c0 0 decays. A counter of plastic scintillator sheets, named BCV, covered the inner surface of the MB. The upstream end of the decay region was covered by the Front Barrel (FB) [23] and the Neutron Collar Counter (NCC) [24]. The FB was a lead-scintillator sandwich counter and NCC was made of CsI crystals. These veto counters detected photons from K L decays in the upstream direction. The downstream region of the calorimeter was covered by a series of photon veto counters named CC04, CC05, and CC06, and in-beam counters named BHCV and BHPV [25], meant to detect particles escaping in the forward direction through the beam hole of the calorimeter. All counters except for CC05, CC06, BHCV, and BHPV were located in vacuum at 0.1 Pa, and the decay volume was kept at 5 \u00d7 10 \u22125 Pa to suppress \u03c0 0 's produced by the interactions of neutrons in the beam with residual gas. This high-vacuum region was separated from the counter region with a multi-layer film called the \"membrane,\" whose area density was 202 \u03bcg cm \u22122 .",

            "text": "The data analyzed in this letter was collected in 100 hours between May 19 and 23, 2013, before the data taking was suspended due to an incident at HEF caused by an accelerator malfunction [28]. The beam power incident on the gold target was 24 kW, which corresponded to 3 \u00d7 10 13 protons on target (POT) in a 2 s duration (spill) with a 6 s repetition. The total number of POT was 1.6 \u00d7 10 18 . The data acquisition system was triggered by two levels of trigger logic [29]. The first-level trigger (L1) required the total energy detected in the calorimeter to be larger than 550 MeV. The acceptance loss due to this and the subsequent offline requirement was less than 1%. It also required the total energy deposition to be less than 1 MeV in CV and less than 50-60 MeV in NCC, MB, and CC03 to reject most K L decays with charged particles or photons hitting the veto counters. The energy thresholds for the L1 selection were set to be looser than those for the offline analysis. In the second-level trigger (L2), the center of energy deposition (COE) in the calorimeter was calculated and the distance from the beam center to the COE position was required to be larger than 165 mm. This requirement was used to suppress the K L \u2192 3\u03c0 0 decay because the energy of photons from the decay will balance in the transverse direction, while the COE distance tends to be large in the K L \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03bd\u03bd decay due to the neutrinos in the final state. With these trigger requirements, 300 million events were collected for K L \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03bd\u03bd. To collect data from the K L \u2192 3\u03c0 0 , K L \u2192 2\u03c0 0 , and K L \u2192 2\u03b3 decays simultaneously for normalization and calibration purposes, disregarding the L2 decision, events which satisfied the L1 requirements, and L1 requirements without veto were also recorded with prescaling factors of 30 and 300, respectively. In total, \u223c8000 events per spill were collected. cluster of hits in adjacent crystals was associated with an electromagnetic shower generated by a photon as described in Ref. [30]. After the photon reconstruction, events with two photons were selected for \u03c0 0 reconstruction. The \u03c0 0 -decay vertex position (Z vtx ) was obtained assuming that a \u03c0 0 \u2192 2\u03b3 decay occurred on the beam (z) axis. Here, the z axis is defined as the center of the beam as shown in Fig. 1, and z = 0 m corresponds to 21.5 m downstream from the target. The transverse momentum (P T ) and the decay time of the \u03c0 0 were calculated with the calorimeter information and Z vtx .",

To ensure the L1 and L2 requirements of the calorimeter in the offline analysis were met, the sum of the two photon energies was required to be larger than 650 MeV, and the COE position was required to be farther than 200 mm from the beam center. Events were rejected if any channel in the veto counters had a hit coincident with the \u03c0 0 decay time. Timings in most of the veto counters were calculated by using the pulse shape near the peak; with this method, possible errors in the timing evaluations due to overlapping multiple pulses, which could give a detection inefficiency, were reduced. The typical energy thresholds for the veto cuts were 2-3 MeV for the photon veto counters and 0.2 MeV for CV to achieve tight rejection of both the extra photons and charged particles in the K L decay. The shape of the cluster in the x-y plane was required to be consistent with the expected shape of an electromagnetic shower due to a single photon obtained by simulation [18]. This requirement rejected events containing a cluster made by multiple photons or a hadronic shower made by neutrons. We also developed neural network cuts to further remove neutron contributions, based on the difference of kinematic features and cluster shapes between photon and neutron in the calorimeter. Details on the selection criteria are described in Ref. [31].",

            "text": "We set the signal region for the K L \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03bd\u03bd decay using the P T and Z vtx of the reconstructed \u03c0 0 . The P T was required to be larger than 150 MeV/c to remove K L \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 events for which the \u03c0 0 is restricted to have a transverse momentum less than 133 MeV/c [33]. To avoid contaminations from halo neutron interactions with detectors, we also required 3000 < Z vtx < 4700 mm. The probability that a K L entering the KOTO detector decays in this Z vtx region was 3.2%. The events observed in this analysis are shown in Fig. 2, in which all the cuts except for P T and Z vtx have been imposed.  To avoid introducing bias in the cut optimization, all criteria were predetermined before examining events in and around the signal region, indicated by the box with a thin solid line in Fig. 2. Table 1 summarizes the estimation of background events in the signal region. The numbers of observed events and estimated background events inside and outside the signal region are also shown in Fig. 2. The backgrounds were categorized into two types: K L backgrounds and neutron backgrounds. The K L backgrounds were evaluated by using Geant4-based [32] Monte Carlo simulations (MC) for each K L decay mode. Accidental hits in the KOTO detector had been collected simultaneously with the data taking, and were overlaid on the MC samples. The background studies based on MC were validated with the K L \u2192 2\u03c0 0 and K L \u2192 3\u03c0 0 data. To reconstruct the K L \u2192 2\u03c0 0 (K L \u2192 3\u03c0 0 ) decays, events with four (six) photons in the calorimeter were selected. Among all possible combinations of the photons, the combination that had the best agreement of the Z vtx values for two (three) \u03c0 0 's was adopted. Figure 3 shows the four-photon invariant mass distribution of the K L \u2192 2\u03c0 0 events before and after imposing the veto cuts. The events in the low mass region are mostly from the K L \u2192 3\u03c0 0 decays in which four out of six photons were detected in the calorimeter. The reduction of these events by detecting the extra two photons in the veto counters is well reproduced by the MC. Figure 4 shows the distributions of the reconstructed K L decay vertex position and energy of the K L \u2192 3\u03c0 0 events, which indicated the acceptance derived from MC was well understood.  The K L \u2192 2\u03c0 0 decay is the major K L background source because there are only two extra photons that can be detected by veto counters. We generated an MC sample with 40 times the statistics of the data. With two MC events that remained in the signal region after imposing all the cuts, the background contribution was estimated to be 0.047 events. For other decay modes, we generated the MC samples with various assumptions of topologies or mechanisms that could cause backgrounds to K L \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03bd\u03bd. In the case of K L \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 , for instance, the decay can be a background if charged pions hit the downstream beam pipe, which was made of 5-mm-thick stainless steel, and were undetected. The nine events located in the low-P T region (P T < 120 MeV/c, 2900 < Z vtx < 5100 mm) in Fig. 2 are explained by this mechanism. The requirement P T > 150 MeV/c reduced the K L \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 background to a negligible level. The K L \u2192 2\u03b3 decay can be a background if an incident K L is scattered at the upstream vacuum window, which was made of 125-\u03bcm-thick polyimide film, and obtains a finite transverse momentum. The K L \u2192 2\u03b3 decay was simulated for K L 's with transverse momentum larger than 20 MeV/c, and the number of this background was estimated to be 0.03 events. Accidental hits overlapping with the K L \u2192 \u03c0 \u00b1 e \u2213 \u03bd e , K L \u2192 \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03bc \u2213 \u03bd \u03bc , K L \u2192 3\u03c0 0 , and K L \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 decays can change the reconstructed hit timing and cause an inefficiency. The background due to this inefficiency was separately treated and estimated to be 0.014 events.",

This value is comparable to the final sensitivity of the E391a experiment, which was derived with a number of POT of 2.5 \u00d7 10 18 with 12-GeV protons over four months [6]. The systematic uncertainties in the SES are summarized in Table 2. The major uncertainties came from the veto cuts and the L2 trigger effect. The uncertainty in the veto cuts was evaluated by comparing the extra-particle rejection factors, defined as N all /N cut , of each veto counter between data and MC, where N all is the number of events after imposing all the cuts, and N cut is the number of events with all the cuts except a specific one. The K L \u2192 2\u03b3 decay instead of K L \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03bd\u03bd was used for the signal acceptance. The BCV veto cut showed the largest uncertainty of 4.0%. The uncertainty in the L2 trigger effect was due to trigger bias that remained after the offline COE cut was imposed. It did not affect the K L \u2192 2\u03c0 0 acceptance because the L2 trigger was not used for the normalization data. The uncertainty was evaluated by studying the L2 efficiency as a function of the reconstructed COE value in the offline analysis from data samples with various trigger requirements and cuts. This uncertainty was found to be the largest at 6.56%. 7. Results After all the selection criteria were determined, the events in the signal region were examined. One event was observed as shown in Fig. 2. The number is consistent with the expected number of background events summarized in Table 1. Assuming Poisson statistics with the statistical and systematic uncertainties considered [34], the 90% C.L. upper limit on Br(K L \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03bd\u03bd) was set to be 5.1 \u00d7 10 \u22128 .",
