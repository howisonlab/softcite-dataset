The analysis is based on protonproton collision data at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC in 2016, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 . The search is performed in five Higgs boson decay channels: h \u2192 bb, \u03b3\u03b3, \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 , W + W \u2212 , and ZZ. The results from the individual channels are combined to maximize the sensitivity of the analysis. No significant excess over the expected standard model background is observed in any of the five channels or in their combination. Limits are set on DM production in the context of two simplified models. The results are also interpreted in terms of a spin-independent DM-nucleon scattering cross section and compared to those from directdetection DM experiments. This is the first search for DM particles produced in association with a Higgs boson decaying to a pair of W or Z bosons, and the first statistical combination based on five Higgs boson decay channels.",

A favored hypothesis is that the bulk of DM is in the form of stable, electrically neutral, weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) [8], with masses in a range between a few GeV and a few TeV, thus opening the possibility of DM production at high-energy colliders [9]. Traditionally, searches for DM at colliders involve a pair of WIMPs that recoil against a visible SM particle or a set of SM particles. Because of the lack of electric charge and the small interaction cross section, WIMPs do not leave a directly detectable signal, but in a hadron collider experiment their presence can be inferred via an imbalance in the total momentum in the plane transverse to the colliding beams ( p miss T ), as reconstructed in the detector. This scenario gives rise to a potential signature where a set of SM particles, X, are produced recoiling against the DM particles, represented by the p miss T (the \"mono-X\" signature). Recent searches at the CERN LHC considered X to be a hadronic jet [10,11], heavy-flavor quarks (bottom and top) [12,13], a photon [14,15], or a W or Z boson [11,[16][17][18].",

In this paper we designate the state observed at 125 GeV by the symbol h, since in the context of the theoretical models considered below, it does not correspond to the SM Higgs boson. Here, we present a search for the pair production of DM particles in association with a Higgs boson resulting in the final state h + p miss T [22,23], referred to as the \"mono-Higgs\". While in a typical mono-X search, the X particle is emitted as initial-state radiation, this process is strongly suppressed for the case of the Higgs boson because of the smallness of both the Higgs boson Yukawa couplings to light quarks and its loop-suppressed coupling to gluons. Thus, the mono-Higgs production can be either a result of final-state radiation of DM particles, or of a beyond-the-SM interaction of DM particles with the Higgs boson, typically via a mediator particle. A number of searches have been carried out by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations looking for the mono-Higgs signature in several Higgs boson decay channels, at center-of-mass energies of . So far, none of these searches has observed a significant excess of events over the SM expectations.",

However, if the mediator A is produced on-shell, the kinematic distributions of the final-state particles depend only on the Z and A boson masses, m Z and m A . In this paper, a scan in m Z between 450 and 4000 GeV and in m A between 300 and 1000 GeV is performed. The values of m A below 300 GeV have been already excluded by the existing constraints on flavor changing neutral currents in the b \u2192 s\u03b3 transitions [34], and hence are not considered in the analysis. The masses of the 2HDM heavy Higgs boson and the charged Higgs boson are both fixed to the m A mass. The ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two Higgs doublets, tan \u03b2, is varied from 0.4 to 10. The DM particle mass is fixed to 100 GeV, the A-DM coupling strength g \u03c7 is fixed to 1, and the Z coupling strength to quarks g Z is fixed to 0.8. The branching fraction of the decay of A to DM particles B(A \u2192 \u03c7\u03c7) decreases as the mass of the DM candidate (m \u03c7 ) increases, for the range of m A considered in this analysis. However, since the relative decrease in B(A \u2192 \u03c7\u03c7) is less than 7% as m \u03c7 increases from 1 to 100 GeV, the results shown in this paper for m \u03c7 = 100 GeV are also applicable to lighter DM particles.",

Nevertheless, we keep this benchmark, specifically developed for the LHC Run-2 searches [33], to allow a direct comparison with the results of other mono-Higgs searches. Given that the kinematic distributions of the final states depend only very weakly on the value of the g Z coupling, our results can be reinterpreted for lower g Z values, where the interplay between the mono-Higgs and the dijet analysis sensitivities changes.",

The continuum WW production is simulated in different ways: powheg [52] is used to generate qq \u2192 WW events at NLO precision, whereas gg \u2192 WW events are generated at LO using mcfm v7.0 [53][54][55]. The simulated qq \u2192 WW events are reweighted to reproduce the p WW T distribution from the p T -resummed calculation at next-to-NLO (NNLO) plus next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic precision [56,57]. The LO gg \u2192 WW cross section, obtained directly from mcfm, is further corrected to NNLO precision via a K factor of 1.4 [58]. Single top quark, tt, WZ, and W\u03b3 * backgrounds are generated at NLO with powheg. Drell-Yan (DY) production of Z/\u03b3 * is generated at NLO using MadGraph5 amc@nlo, and the p T spectrum of the dilepton pairs is reweighted to match the distribution observed in dimuon events in data. Other multiboson processes, such as W\u03b3, ZZ, and VVV (V = W or Z), are generated at NLO with MadGraph5 amc@nlo. All samples are normalized to the latest available theoretical cross sections, NLO or higher [53,54,59].",

In all cases, the Higgs boson is forced to decay via the h \u2192 ZZ \u2192 4 ( = e, \u00b5, or \u03c4) channel. The description of the decay of the Higgs boson to four leptons is obtained using the JHUgen 7.0.2 generator [65,66].

Jet momentum is determined as the vectorial sum of all particle momenta in the jet, and is found from simulation to be, on average, within 5 to 10% of the true momentum over the entire p T spectrum and detector acceptance. Pileup interactions can result in additional spurious contributions to the jet momentum measurement from tracks and calorimetric energy depositions. To mitigate this effect, tracks identified to be originating from pileup vertices are discarded and a correction based on the jet area [75] is applied to account for the neutral pileup particle contributions. Jet energy corrections are derived from simulation to bring the measured response of jets to that of particle-level jets on average. In situ measurements of the momentum balance in dijet, photon+jet, Z+jet, and multijet events are used to account for any residual differences in the jet energy scale (JES) between data and simulation [76]. The jet energy resolution (JER) amounts typically to 15% at p T = 10 GeV, 8% at 100 GeV, and 4% at 1 TeV. Additional selection criteria are applied to remove jets potentially dominated by anomalous contributions from various subdetector components or reconstruction failures [77].",

To reduce the impact of particles arising from pileup interactions when reconstructing AK8 or CA15 jets, the four-vector of each PF candidate matched to the jet is scaled with a weight calculated with the pileup-per-particle identification algorithm [80] prior to the clustering. The CA15 jets are also required to be central (|\u03b7| < 2.4). The \"soft-drop\" jet grooming algorithm [81] is applied to remove soft, large-angle radiation from the jets.

The trigger selection is 96 (100)% efficient for events that subsequently have p miss T > 200 (350) GeV in the offline reconstruction. As can be seen in figure 2, the Lorentz boosts of the Higgs boson are different for the Z -2HDM and baryonic Z model.

In the case of the CA15 jets, a multivariate double b tagging algorithm [82] is used to discriminate the signal from the background of light-flavor jets [31], with an efficiency of 50% and a misidentification rate of 10%. The AK8 (CA15) analysis requires the Higgs boson candidate mass to be in the 105-135 (100-150) GeV range to reduce nonresonant backgrounds. The difference in the two mass window requirements is primarily driven by the differences in the performance of the two algorithms and in the jet mass resolutions. For both analyses, the mass window was chosen to maximize the signal sensitivity. In order to further reduce the background contributions from W + jets and tt production, events with an electron, muon, photon (p T > 10 GeV), or \u03c4 h (p T > 18 GeV) candidates passing loose identification and isolation criteria are vetoed. Furthermore, in the AK8 analysis, the number of additional b tagged AK4 jets with p T > 20 GeV is required to be zero, while in the CA15 analysis, the number of AK4 jets with p T > 30 GeV, well-separated from the CA15 jet in the event, is required to be at most one. The sensitivity of the analyses is further enhanced by using jet substructure variables. The full details of the event selection for the AK8 and CA15 jet analyses can be found in refs.

In order to suppress the contribution of QCD production of low-mass dilepton resonances, all four opposite-sign pairs that can be built with the four leptons (regardless of the lepton flavor) must satisfy m i j > 4 GeV and the four-lepton invariant mass must satisfy m 4 > 70 GeV. If more than one ZZ candidate passes the selection, the one with the highest value of the scalar p T sum of four leptons is chosen. The above requirements define the event preselection.",

The Z+X background is estimated from data by first determining the lepton misidentification probability in a dedicated CR and then using it to derive the background contribution in the SR. The lepton misidentification probability is defined as the probability that a lepton passing a loose selection with relaxed identification or isolation criteria also passes the tight selection criteria. The misidentification probability is measured in a Z+lepton CR where the Z boson candidate (with the mass within 7 GeV of the nominal Z boson mass) is formed from the two selected leptons passing the tight identification criteria, and an additional lepton is required to pass the loose selection. This sample is dominated by Z+nonprompt-lepton events. The electron and muon misidentification probabilities are measured as functions of the lepton candidate p T , its location in the barrel or endcap region of the ECAL or the muon system, and p miss T in the event, using Z(\u2192 )+e and Z(\u2192 )+\u00b5 events, respectively, in the Z+lepton CR.

The summary of the vetoes on additional objects, namely electrons, muons, \u03c4 leptons, photons, jets, and b tagged jets, in each analysis is presented in table 2. These selections not only reduce the major backgrounds, but also ensure the nearly complete mutual exclusivity of the analyses considered for the combination. The overlap in the SR is zero and for the CR it is less than 0.01%, i.e., it is much smaller than the systematic uncertainty in the analysis. The combination of the analyses in the five Higgs boson decay channels is performed for both the Z -2HDM and the baryonic Z model. For each model, the h \u2192 bb channel dominates the sensitivity in most of the phase space, and hence the combined results are dominated by this channel. However, there are regions of the parameter space that are hard to probe with h \u2192 bb decays, and other channels play a major role there. The analysis strategies for all channels are the same for both models, except for the h \u2192 bb channel, where two different strategies are used because of the difference in the Lorentz boost of the Higgs boson.

A similar procedure is applied for the DY background, by defining a CR in low-m T phase space, and to the nonresonant WW background, for which a high-m CR is defined. The top quark and DY background normalizations are correlated between their respective CRs and the SR and are left unconstrained in the fit. The change in the PDF, the renormalization and the factorization scale variations from their nominal values lead to migration of the top quark and Z/\u03b3 * \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 background events between the respective CRs and the SR. To take into account this effect, the change in the top quark (Z/\u03b3 * \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 ) background yield is used as an additional 1 (2)% uncertainty in the corresponding CR. The shapes of the WZ and other minor backgrounds are taken from simulation and normalized to their theoretical predictions, with the theoretical uncertainties estimated. The uncertainties related to the modeling of p miss T are estimated by considering the effect of varying the lepton energy scale on p miss T . Experimental uncertainties are estimated by applying scale factors between data and simulation, and/or by smearing of certain kinematic variables in simulation, with the cor-JHEP03 2020  responding changes further propagated to all analysis variables. The signal acceptance uncertainty associated with the combination of single-lepton and dilepton triggers is measured to be 2%. The uncertainty in the ratio between the single top quark and top quark pair production cross sections, 8% at 13 TeV [87], has been also included, as it affects the top quark background yield from the maximum-likelihood fit used to extract the signal and dominant backgrounds. The uncertainty in the p T spectrum of the top quark has been applied to all the observables in order to cover the difference between the simulated and observed spectra [88], and is of the order of 1%. The uncertainty in the Higgs boson branching fraction for the h \u2192 WW decay is about 1% [67]. The uncertainty in the NNLO K factor applied to the LO gg \u2192 WW cross section estimate is 15% [89]. The p WW T spectrum in the qq \u2192 WW sample has been reweighted to match the resummed calculation [56,57]. The associated shape uncertainties related to the missing higher-order corrections are modeled by varying the factorization, renormalization, and resummation scales up and down independently by a factor of 2 from their nominal values [56]. Finally, uncertainties arising from the limited size of the simulated samples are included for each bin of the BDT discriminant distributions, in each category.

The second uncertainty, attributed to significant mismeasurement of p miss T , is an uncertainty in the \"mismeasured\" p miss T . The uncertainties from the modeling of genuine p miss T are measured by varying the parameters associated with the corrections applied to p miss T and by propagating those variations to the p miss T calculation, after applying the full analysis selection.

This sample is enriched in misidentified leptons that form the same-sign pair and is expected to lead to significant mismeasurement of p miss T , not already covered by the uncertainties in the Gaussian core discussed above. We derive the mismeasured p miss T uncertainty from the comparison of the p miss T shapes in the \"OS+SS\" sample and in the SR, with a requirement that the m 4 be outside the Higgs boson invariant mass peak (|m 4 \u2212 125 GeV| > 10 GeV).

The signal is normalized to the product of cross section and B, where B represents the h \u2192 WW branching fraction. The signal distributions are scaled up by a factor 500 (100) for the Z -2HDM (baryonic Z model), to make them more visible. The systematic uncertainties are shown by the hatched band.

In this model, Dirac DM particles couple to a vector Z mediator, which also couples to the SM quarks. A point in the parameter space of this model is determined by four variables: the DM particle mass m \u03c7 , the mediator mass m med , the mediator-DM coupling g \u03c7 , and the universal mediator-quark coupling g q . The couplings for the present analysis are fixed to g \u03c7 = 1.0 and g q = 0.25, following the recommendation of ref. [37]. The results are interpreted in terms of 90% CL limits on the spin-independent (SI) cross section \u03c3 SI for the DM-nucleon scattering. The value of \u03c3 SI for a given set of parameters in the s-channel simplified DM model is given by [37]: 1) where \u00b5 nDM is the reduced mass of the DM-nucleon system and f (g q ) is the mediatornucleon coupling, which depends on g q . The resulting \u03c3 SI limits, as functions of m \u03c7 are shown in figure 11. Results obtained in this analysis are compared with those from the CMS dijet analyses 1 [39,41] and from several direct-detection experiments. For the chosen set of parameters, the cross section limit from the present analysis is more stringent than the direct-detection limits for m \u03c7 between 1 and 5 GeV.",
