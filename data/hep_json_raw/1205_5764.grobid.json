The analysis is based on the selection of the dileptonic final states with events featuring two isolated leptons, electron or muon, with significant transverse missing momentum and at least one jet. An approach based on boosted decision trees has been developed to improve the discrimination of single top-quark Wt events from background. A template fit to the final classifier distributions is performed to determine the crosssection. The result is incompatible with the background-only hypothesis at the 3.3\u03c3 level, the expected sensitivity assuming the Standard Model production rate being 3.4\u03c3 . The corresponding cross-section is determined and found to be \u03c3 Wt = 16.8 \u00b1 2.9 (stat) \u00b1 4.9 (syst) pb, in good agreement with the Standard Model expectation. From this result the CKM matrix element |V tb | = 1.03 +0.16    \u22120.19 is derived assuming that the Wt production through |V ts | and |V td | is small.",

            "text": "At the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the electroweak production of single top-quarks represents about half of the tt-pair production cross-section. First measurements of the single top-quark production [3,4] have been obtained in the t-channel at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV, and show good agreement with the SM expectation. The associated production of a top quark and a W boson involves the interaction of a gluon and a b-quark emitting an onshell W boson, as shown in the Feynman diagrams in Fig. 1. The final state thus contains two W bosons and an additional quark from the top quark decay, normally a b-quark. Next-to-leadingorder Wt Feynman diagrams including a second b-quark may interfere with tt-pair production. The interference should be small in the reconstructed exclusive final state with only one quark, where the largest fraction of Wt signal is expected. In this analysis, the Wt leading-order approximation is used, and the difference between leading-order and next-to-leading-order Wt calculation is \u2729 \u00a9 CERN for the benefit of the ATLAS Collaboration. E-mail address: atlas.publications@cern.ch. considered as modelling uncertainty. Because of the massive particles in the final state, this production mechanism has an extremely low rate at the Tevatron compared to t-channel, but is expected to have a much higher cross-section at the LHC, where the available partonic energy and the gluon flux are larger. For proton-proton collisions at 7 TeV, the single top-quark Wt-channel production cross-section is estimated to be 15.7 \u00b1 1.1 pb [5] for a top quark mass of 172.5 GeV.",

            "text": "Since the three modes of single top-quark production are sensitive to different manifestations of physics beyond the SM, measurements of the individual cross-sections are complementary to each other and allow some sources of new phenomena to be disentangled. The production mode with both a W boson and a top quark in the final state has the special feature that both particles can be identified. Thus, the measurement of the corresponding cross-section can be sensitive to new phenomena which modify the W -t-b interaction, but insensitive to flavor-changing neutral currents (FCNCs) or new particles such as W , t and technipions [6]. The measurement of the single top-quark Wt-channel production cross-sections therefore serves as a direct probe of the W -t-b coupling and allows the direct determination of the quarkmixing matrix element |V tb | [7,8]. This result can be compared to the results obtained from t-and s-channel production measurements.",

Samples of simulated events for single top-quark processes are produced with AcerMC version 3.7 [13] coupled with the MRST2007 [14] parton distribution functions (PDFs). The ttpair processes are generated using MC@NLO version 3.41 [15], interfaced with the CTEQ6.6 PDFs set [16]. All top quark samples are normalised using next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) cross-sections [5,[17][18][19]. Gauge boson (W /Z ) production in association with jets is simulated using the leading-order generator ALPGEN version 2.13 [20], coupled with CTEQ6L1 PDFs [21]. The diboson processes W W , W Z and Z Z are generated using ALP-GEN version 2.13 with MRST2007 PDFs. In all cases, HERWIG [22] is used for the showering and is linked to the underlying event model in JIMMY version 4.31 [23]. After the event generation, all samples are passed through the full simulation of the ATLAS detector [24] based on GEANT4 [25] and are reconstructed using the same procedure as collision data. The simulation includes the effect of a variable number of proton-proton collisions per bunch crossing and is weighted to reproduce the same distribution of the number of collisions per bunch crossing as observed in data. The average number of interactions per bunch crossing is 6.2 in this data set.",

This result is compatible with the combination of direct measurements at the Tevatron[42]: |V tb | = 0.88 +0.07 \u22120.07 , and the measurement by ATLAS[3]: |V tb | = 1.13 +0.14 \u22120.13 .",
