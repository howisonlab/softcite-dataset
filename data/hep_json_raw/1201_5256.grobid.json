Searches for new particles, strong gravity, and more generic searches for new phenomena with over 1 fb \u22121 of LHC proton-proton collision data at center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV collected by the ATLAS experiment are presented in the following.",

The analysis uses specialized tracking and vertexing reconstruction algorithms to reconstruct the vertices in the MS, from \u03c0 v decays to jet pairs. This is illustrated in Fig. 7.

The predicted form of these deviations is often either a resonance or an excess in the number of events in the spectra at high mass. If quarks and leptons are composite, with at least one common constituent, the interaction of these constituents would likely be manifested through an effective four-fermion contact interaction (CI) at energies well below the compositeness scale \u039b. Such a CI could also describe a new interaction with a messenger too heavy for direct observation at the LHC.",
