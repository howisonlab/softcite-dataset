Furthermore, we know that a \u03c0 + is more likely to have fragmented from a u quark (\"favored\" fragmentation) than a d quark (\"disfavored\" fragmentation). The converse is true for \u03c0 \u2212 , and the ratio of favored to disfavored fragmentation grows as the fraction of the parton momentum carried by the pion increases. This feature makes A LL (\u03c0 + ) a particularly attractive measurement, since its analyzing power is magnified by the significant u quark polarization in the kinematic range where qg scattering dominates the pion production cross section.",

The beam polarizations at RHIC are measured every few hours using a high-statistics Coulomb Nuclear Interference (CNI) polarimeter [3], and the analyzing power of the CNI polarimeter is normalized using a gas jet polarimeter [4]. The spin-dependent relative luminosities are measured at STAR using the Beam Beam Counters (BBCs), segmented scintillator annuli that provide full azimuthal coverage and span 3 < |\u03b7| < 5 in rapidity . Coincident signals in the two BBCs define STAR's pp minimum-bias trigger condition; this approach samples 87% of the non-singly diffractive scattering cross section [5]. The BBCs can also be used to measure residual transverse beam polarization, which manifests as an azimuthal asymmetry in the scintillator tile counts. The minimum-bias trigger condition is necessary but not sufficient to select events for this analysis. Also required is an electromagnetic energy deposit in the Barrel Electro-Magnetic Calorimeter (BEMC) which enhances STAR's sampling of hard scattering events. This jet patch (JP) trigger condition splits the BEMC into fixed patches with an extent of \u2206\u03b7 \u00d7 \u2206\u03c6 = 1.0 \u00d7 1.0 and looks for summed energy above a threshold in at least one patch. In the 2005 RHIC run the JP trigger was implemented for 0 < \u03b7 < 1 with a primary threshold of 6.5 GeV. In 2006 the BEMC was fully commissioned and the JP trigger acceptance doubled to |\u03b7| < 1.0 with a threshold of 8.3 GeV. The BEMC has a depth of \u223c1 hadronic interaction length, so charged pions often leave only a MIP signal of 264 MeV [6] in the calorimeter.",

The TPC can measure the transverse momenta of charged particles up to 20 GeV/c, and measurements of the energy loss along the track allow for particle identification across a wide range of momenta. The dE/dx and momentum of a track are nominally compared to a Bichsel parameterization of charged particle interactions in the TPC gas volume to obtain its PID; corrections to the Bichsel curves using particles identified via other means (electrons from the BEMC, pions and protons from strange decays) can improve the accuracy of dE/dx-based PID and allow for pion identification up to 15 GeV/c [7]. Figure 1 shows the ratio of cross sections for inclusive \u03c0 \u2212 and \u03c0 + production as a function of p T , using data taken by STAR during the 2005 run. Both cross sections are separately consistent with NLO predictions [8]. The ratio clearly diverges from unity at high transverse momenta, and this divergence is modeled well by NLO pQCD predictions incorporating modern fragmentation functions from the DSS [9] and AKK [10] collaborations.",

However, the increased thresholds used in the 2006 version of the JP trigger lead to a significant fragmentation bias for jets that fire the trigger. Rather than fold this bias into a systematic uncertainty on A LL , we restricted the 2006 charged pion A LL to pions opposite a trigger jet (\u2206\u03c6 > 2.0). Furthermore, we plot A LL not against pion p T but against the ratio of pion p T and trigger jet p T . This ratio serves as a surrogate for the fragmentation variable z and, along with a restriction on the trigger jet p T , allows the analysis to identify a region of phase space where the effect of \u2206g(x) on A LL is magnified by the large u quark polarization.",

We quantify a) by using Monte Carlo to determine the trigger efficiency for jets at a given p T . In the range of jet p T selected for this analysis we can parametrize the efficiency as N jets,trigger /N jets,total = 1.149 \u2212 0.2655 * p T + 0.01857 * p 2 T \u2212 0.0003445 * p 3 T .

Future analyses with greater statistical precision may be able to avoid this requirement by binning in both jet p T and z. For b) we investigate how our LO Monte Carlo evaluation of A LL changes when we require the JP trigger condition. Specifically, we compare our MC asymmetries for the JP trigger with MC asymmetries that incorporate only the trigger efficiency. The difference between the two is a measure of how the trigger's preference for quark jets affects A LL . This contribution presented a ratio of the differential cross sections for inclusive charged pion production that shows a clear divergence from unity at high p T , as well as a new measurement of A LL for charged pion production opposite a trigger jet. A forthcoming NLO prediction for this observable will allow the measurement to be included in global analyses.
