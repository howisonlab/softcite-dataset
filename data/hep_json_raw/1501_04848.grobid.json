In the second study presented below both these production channels are used when estimating how many events of the \u03c9 \u2192 \u03c0 0 l + l \u2212 decay can be found. In the third study only the e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c9\u03c0 0 production channel is used to investigate the dynamics of the dominant \u03c9 decay channel, \u03c9 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 . The decay \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c9\u03b3 would violate C-parity in electromagnetic interactions and thus the reaction is not expected to occur. Currently the upper limit of the branching ratio for the reaction is BR(\u03c6 \u2192 \u03c9\u03b3) < 5% at 84% C.L., measured in a bubble chamber experiment performed in the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory in 1966 [1].",

However, the experimental value deviates from its theoretical prediction [2] Light-meson transition form factors could potentially play a role in the theoretical prediction of the magnetic moment of muons. One of the main models used to predict such form factors is the Vector Meson Dominance model. However, for the \u03c9\u03c0 0 form factor this model shows a large deviation from the values measured by NA60 experiment in the decay \u03c9 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 [3]. Alternative theoretical approaches [4], attempting to describe the transition form factors of light-meson decays, give better correspondence to the NA60 data and only fails in the higher energy region. But on the other hand they are not able to reproduce the recent KLOE preliminary measurement of the form factor of \u03c6 \u2192 \u03b7e + e \u2212 . For the solution of this puzzle a second high statistics measurement of the \u03c9\u03c0 0 form factor would be advisable. Here we present the expected yields for the signal events using existing KLOE data.",

The dynamics of the \u03c9 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 decay includes three main effects. Firstly the three pions are produced predominantly in a P-wave state. This is the prevalent feature of the Dalitz plot distribution which was used to determine the \u03c9 meson quantum numbers [6]. Secondly the \u03c1 meson plays a role as an intermediate two pion state. Thirdly, any final state \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 interactions might also affect the density distribution. The last two effects are subtle and have not yet been established since the previous experiments lacked the required statistics. Two recently developed theoretical models have made predictions for this density distribution [7][8] that could only be tested using a high statistics experimental Dalitz plot distribution, which the data collected by KLOE could provide.",
