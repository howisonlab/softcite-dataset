            "text": "Heavy quarkonium states have long been proposed as a sensitive probe of the strongly-interacting deconfined medium expected to be formed in the early stages of high-energy heavy-ion collisions [1]. In particular, a measurement of the in-medium dissociation probability of different quarkonium states is expected to provide an estimate of the initial temperature of the medium. Suppression of J/\u03c8 production beyond that expected from cold nuclear matter (CNM) effects (nuclear absorption, (anti-)shadowing, ...) has indeed been observed at SPS and RHIC energies [2,3,4], but several questions are left open. At the LHC, larger suppression might be expected, due to the higher initial temperature. However, according to regeneration scenarios [5], with \u223c 10 times more cc pairs produced in central Pb-Pb collisions compared to RHIC, an enhancement of the J/\u03c8 production could also be observed. In the ALICE experiment, at forward rapidity (2.5 < y < 4), the inclusive production of heavy quarkonium states is measured down to p T = 0 via their \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 decay channels in the muon spectrometer, as describe in [6].",

            "text": "In fall 2010, the LHC delivered the first Pb-Pb collisions at a center of mass energy \u221a s NN = 2.76 TeV. ALICE collected data with a minimum bias (MB) trigger, defined as the logical AND between signals from the pixel detector (SPD) covering the range |\u03b7| < 2 and the two scintillator arrays of the VZERO detector covering the ranges 2.8 < \u03b7 < 5.1 and \u22123.7 < \u03b7 < \u22121.7, in coincidence with two beam pick-up counters, one on each side of the interaction region. The centrality of the collision has been determined from the amplitude of the VZERO signal [7]. The total data sample available for physics analysis amounts to 17 \u2022 10 6 MB events. Additional cuts have then been applied to improve the purity of the muon sample, in particular by requiring both particles in the pair to be detected in the muon trigger stations. Furthermore, we perform the cuts \u22124 < \u03b7 < \u22122.5 and 17.6 < R abs < 89 cm, where R abs is the radial coordinate of the track at the end of the hadronic absorber located in front of the spectrometer, to select muons in the geometrical acceptance of the detector. After these selections, the data sample has been divided into four centrality classes: 0-10%, 10-20%, 20-40% and 40-80% of the inelastic Pb-Pb cross section. In each of these sub-samples, the number of J/\u03c8 particles has been extracted by using two different methods. We have first fitted the opposite-sign dimuon invariant mass distribution with a Crystal Ball (CB) function (a gaussian with polynomial tails) to reproduce the J/\u03c8 shape and a sum of two exponentials to describe the underlying continuum ( Fig. 1-left). Alternatively, we have subtracted the combinatorial background using the event-mixing technique and fitted the resulting mass distribution with a CB function and an exponential or a straight line to describe the remaining background ( Fig. 1right). The width of the J/\u03c8 mass peak depends on the resolution of the spectrometer which could, a priori, be affected by the detector occupancy which increases with centrality. This effect has been evaluated by embedding simulated J/\u03c8 decays to muons into real events and no modification has been observed. Such a conclusion has been confirmed by a direct measurement of the tracking chamber resolution versus centrality using reconstructed tracks. Therefore, the same CB line shape can be used for all centrality classes. Several parameters have been tested for the CB tails, either fixing them to the values obtained in p-p collisions (where the signal over background ratio is more favorable) or in simulations. For each of these choices, the mean and width of the gaussian part have been obtained by fitting the integrated mass distribution in the centrality range 0-80% and then varying the width by \u00b1 1 standard deviation to account for uncertainties (varying the mean has turned out to have negligible effect in comparison). The number of J/\u03c8 particles in each centrality class i (N i J/\u03c8 ), as well as the ratios",

In order to extract the inclusive J/\u03c8 yield, N i J/\u03c8 has been normalized to the number of MB events in the corresponding centrality class and further corrected for the branching ratio of the dimuon decay channel and the acceptance times efficiency (A \u00d7 \u01eb) of the detector. This latter quantity has been determined from MC simulations. The generated J/\u03c8 p T and y distributions have been interpolated from existing measurements [8], including shadowing effects from EKS98 calculations [9]. The efficiencies of the muon trigger chambers have been measured directly from data then applied to the simulations. For the tracking apparatus, the time-dependent status of each electronic channel and their run-by-run evolution have been taken into account as well as the residual misalignment of the detection elements. We thus obtained a run-averaged value of A \u00d7 \u01eb = 19.4%, with a 7% relative systematic uncertainty. The dependence of the tracking efficiency with the detector occupancy has also been evaluated using the embedding technique. A small decrease of this efficiency when increasing the centrality (\u22122% in the most central class) has been observed. This variation has been confirmed by a measurement of the tracking efficiency performed directly from data, and is included in the systematic uncertainties.",

The systematic uncertainties on the Glauber model calculations are 4% and 6% for T 0\u221210% AA and T 0\u221210% AA /T 40\u221280% AA respectively. The inclusive J/\u03c8 R AA are shown in Fig. 2-left as a function of the average number of nucleons participating to the collision ( N part ) calculated using the Glauber model. To account for the bias due to our large centrality bins, N part has been weighted by the number of binary nucleon-nucleon collisions (N coll ), which is expected to be the scaling variable of the J/\u03c8 production cross-section in A-A, in absence of nuclear matter effects. This correction is small, except for the most peripheral bin where N part = 46 while the weighted value is 70. These results show no significant dependence on centrality, and the integrated R 0\u221280% AA = 0.49 \u00b1 0.03(stat.) \u00b1 0.11(syst.). The comparison with the PHENIX measurements at \u221a s NN = 200 GeV [3,4] shows that the inclusive J/\u03c8 R AA at 2.76 TeV in the rapidity domain 2.5 < y < 4 are clearly above those measured at 200 GeV in 1.2 < |y| < 2.2, while they are closer to the midrapidity values at 200 GeV (except in the most central collisions). The contribution from the B feed down to the J/\u03c8 production in our rapidity and p T domain has been measured to be \u2248 10% in p-p  collisions at \u221a s NN = 7 TeV [11]. Therefore, the difference between the prompt J/\u03c8 R AA and our inclusive measurement is expected to be \u2248 11% if the b production scales with N coll or smaller if it is suppressed by nuclear effects (shadowing, ...). Finally, the comparison of our J/\u03c8 R CP results to the ATLAS measurements in the same centrality classes [12]  (Fig. 2-right) indicates that the J/\u03c8 mesons measured at forward rapidity down to p T = 0 are less suppressed than the high-p T J/\u03c8 mesons at midrapidity (80% of the J/\u03c8 particles measured by ATLAS have a p T larger than 6.5 GeV/c). In summary, these results show a significant suppression of the inclusive J/\u03c8 production in Pb-Pb collisions at \u221a s NN = 2.76 TeV. The comparison with PHENIX results suggests that re-generation mechanisms could play a role. In order to provide tight constraints to suppression/regeneration models, a better knowledge of CNM effects is required, which can be obtained with a measurement of J/\u03c8 production in p-A collisions at the LHC.",
