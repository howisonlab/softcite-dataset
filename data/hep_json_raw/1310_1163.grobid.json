            "text": "We report on a study of the process e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 \u00b1 (DD * ) \u2213 at \u221a s = 4.26 GeV using a 525 pb \u22121 data sample collected with the BESIII detector at the BEPCII storage ring. A distinct charged structure is observed in the (DD * ) \u2213 invariant mass distribution. When fitted to a mass-dependent-width Breit-Wigner lineshape, the pole mass and width are determined to be M pole = (3883.9\u00b11.5\u00b14.2) MeV/c 2 and \u0393 pole = (24.8 \u00b1 3.3 \u00b1 11.0) MeV. The mass and width of the structure, which we refer to as Zc(3885), are 2\u03c3 and 1\u03c3, respectively, below those of the Zc(3900) \u2192 \u03c0 \u00b1 J/\u03c8 peak observed by BESIII and Belle in \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8 final states produced at the same center-of-mass energy. The angular distribution of the \u03c0Zc(3885) system favors a J P = 1 + quantum number assignment for the structure and disfavors 1 \u2212 or 0 \u2212 . The Born cross section times the DD * branching fraction of the Zc(3885) is measured to be \u03c3(e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 \u00b1 Zc(3885) \u2213 ) \u00d7 B(Zc(3885) \u2213 \u2192 (DD * ) \u2213 ) = (83.5 \u00b1 6.6 \u00b1 22.0) pb. Assuming the Zc(3885) \u2192 DD * signal reported here and the Zc(3900) \u2192 \u03c0J/\u03c8 signal are from the same source, the partial width ratio \u0393(Zc(3885)\u2192DD * ) \u0393(Zc(3900)\u2192\u03c0J/\u03c8) = 6.2 \u00b1 1.1 \u00b1 2.7 is determined. The Y (4260) resonance was first seen by BaBar as a peak in the e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8 cross section as a function of e + e \u2212 center-of-mass (CM) energy [1]. It was subsequently confirmed by CLEO [2] and Belle [3]. Its production via the e + e \u2212 annihilation process requires the quantum numbers of the Y (4260) to be J P C = 1 \u2212\u2212 . A peculiar feature is the absence of any apparent corresponding structure in the cross sections for e + e \u2212 \u2192 D ( * )D( * ) (\u03c0) in the \u221a s = 4260 MeV energy region [4]. This implies a lower-limit partial width of \u0393(Y (4260) \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8) > 1 MeV [5] that is one order-of-magnitude larger than measured values for conventional charmonium meson transitions [6], and indicates that the Y (4260) is probably not a conventional quarkonium state.",

A fit to a Breit-Wigner (BW) resonance lineshape yields M = (3899.0 \u00b1 3.6 \u00b1 4.9) MeV/c 2 and \u0393 = (46 \u00b1 10 \u00b1 20) MeV [12]. (Here, and elsewhere in this report, the first errors are statistical and the second systematic.) This observation was subsequently confirmed by Belle [13]. The Z c (3900) mass is \u223c20 MeV/c 2 above the DD * mass threshold, which is suggestive of a virtual DD * molecule-like structure [14,15]; i.e., a charmedsector analog of the Z b (1610). (BESIII also reported resonance-like structures in charged D * D * and \u03c0h c systems at M \u2243 4025 MeV, which may be a charmed-sector analog of the Z b (10650 [16].) Another possibility is a diquark-diantiquark state [17]. It is important to measure the rate for Z c (3900) decays to DD * and compare it to that of the \u03c0J/\u03c8.",

In the following, this structure is referred to as the Z c (3885). The \u03c0 + (DD * ) \u2212 final states are selected by means of a partial reconstruction technique in which only the bachelor \u03c0 + and one final-state D meson are detected, and the presence of theD * is inferred from energy-momentum conservation. (In this report, the inclusion of charge conjugate states is always implied.) We perform parallel analyses of both isospin channels (\u03c0 + D 0 D * \u2212 and \u03c0 \u2212 D +D * 0 ) as a consistency check. The D mesons are reconstructed in the D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + and D + \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + decay channels. The BESIII detector is a large-solid-angle magnetic spectrometer consisting of a 50-layer Helium-gas-based main cylindrical drift chamber (MDC), a barrel-like arrangement of time-of-flight scintillation counters (TOF), and an electromagnetic calorimeter comprised of CsI(Tl) crystals located inside a superconducting solenoid coil that provides a 1 T magnetic field. An iron flux-return located outside of the coil is instrumented with resistive plate chambers to identify muons. The charged particle momentum resolution for 1 GeV/c charged tracks is 0.5% and the energy resolution for 1 GeV photons is 2.5%. Measurements of dE/dx in the MDC and flight times in the TOF are combined to determine pion, kaon and proton identification (ID) probabilities. The hypothesis with the highest ID probability is assigned to each particle. The detector is described in detail in Ref. [18].",

The dashed histogram is from MCsimulated e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 Z c (3885) + , Z c (3885) We apply a two-constraint kinematic fit to the selected events, where we constrain the invariant mass of the D 0 (D + ) candidate tracks to be equal to m D 0 (m D + ) and the mass recoiling from the \u03c0 + D 0 (\u03c0 \u2212 D + ) to be equal to m D * \u2212 (mD * 0 ). If there is more than one bachelor pion candidate in an event, we retain the one with the smallest \u03c7 2 from the kinematic fit. Events with \u03c7 2 < 30 are selected for further analysis. For the \u03c0 + D 0 -tag analysis, we require M (\u03c0 + D 0 ) > 2.02 GeV to reject the events of the type e + e \u2212 \u2192 D * + D * \u2212 , D * + \u2192 \u03c0 + D 0 .

The two distributions are similar and both have a distinct peak near the m D + mD * mass threshold. For cross-feed events, the reconstructed D meson is not in fact recoiling from aD * and the efficiency for satisfying these selection requirements decreases with increasing DD * mass. Studies with phase-space MC event samples show that this acceptance variation is not sufficient to produce a peaking structure.",

We define an asymmetry parameter A = (n >0.5 \u2212 n <0.5 )/(n >0.5 + n <0.5 ), where n >0.5 (n <0.5 ) is the fitted number of Z c (3885) signal events for | cos \u03b8 \u03c0D | > 0.5 (< 0.5).

The fitted Z c (3885) mass is about 2\u03c3 below that of the Z c (3900) [12,13]. However neither fit considers the possibility of interference with a coherent non-resonant background that could shift the results. A J P quantum number determination of the Z c (3900) \u00b1 would provide an additional test of this possibility.",
