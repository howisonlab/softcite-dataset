While precision tests have not revealed any definite violation of this assumption, recent studies of B meson decays involving the higher-mass tau lepton have resulted in observations that challenge lepton universality at the level of four standard deviations. A confirmation of these results would point to new particles or interactions, and could have profound implications for our understanding of particle physics.",

The hadronic tag algorithms [22,23] search for the best match between one of more than a thousand possible decay chains and a subset of all detected particles in the event. The efficiency for finding a correctly matched B tag is unfortunately small, typically 0.3%. The semileptonic tag algorithms relies on a few decays modes with larger branching fractions, resulting in an efficiency of about 1%. However, the presence of the neutrino leads to weaker constraints on the B tag and more importantly on the signal B decay.",

Figure 3 shows one-dimensional projections of the data and the fitted contributions from signal and normalization B decays, and various backgrounds.

For B \u2192 D \u2212 \u03bd decays, there is a sizable contribution from B \u2192 D * \u2212 \u03bd decays, for which the pion or photon from the D * \u2192 D\u03c0 or D * \u2192 D\u03b3 decay was not reconstructed. For LHCb, the peak at zero is somewhat broader and has a long tail into the signal region (Figure 3 h) because of uncertainties in the estimation of the B sig momentum. The E * distributions (Figure 3 c,f,i) provide additional discrimination, since a lepton from a normalization decay has a higher average momentum than a lepton originating from secondary \u03c4 \u2212 \u2192 \u2212 \u03bd \u03c4 \u03bd decays.",

In the framework of the SM, these decays are very rare, since they involve b \u2192 s quark transitions. LHCb [55] published a measurement of the ratio, R K = B(B + \u2192 K + \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) B(B + \u2192 K + e + e \u2212 ) = 0.745 \u00b1 0.090 0.074 \u00b10.036. 7This results is 2.6 standard deviations smaller than the SM expectation of about 1.0. Some theoretical new types of interactions could explain this result. For instance, leptoquarks can mediate this decay and result in higher rates for electrons than muons [56,57]. BABAR [58], LHCb [59] and Belle [60] have analyzed angular distributions for the four decay modes and observed general agreement with SM predictions, except for local deviations, the most significant by LHCb at the level of 3.4 standard deviations. Again, more data are needed to enhance the significance and find possible links to B decays involving \u03c4 leptons.",
