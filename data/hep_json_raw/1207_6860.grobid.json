The neutrino mass is at most 2 eV/c 2 or possibly much less, while the CNGS average beam energy is 17 GeV, so \u03b3 is always >10 11 , much bigger than that obtained in any charged particle beam. A test of Special Relativity with these particles is therefore meaningful. Besides, the measurement may also put an upper limit on the effect of non-standard propagation of neutrinos in matter. This effort was also motivated by the claim, made by the OPERA Collaboration in Sep. 2011 [5], that CNGS neutrinos travel faster than the speed of light in vacuum. This claim, however, was later withdrawn [6].",

Cosmological measurements [7] and neutrinoless double beta decay measurements [8] give a mass limit an order of magnitude smaller, implying an even smaller constraint.

We have therefore designed and installed a new facility capable of achieving an uncertainty of the order of a few ns. This new facility is based on a small-jitter analogue trigger, a geodetic GPS receiver, and a GPSdisciplined atomic Rb clock.
