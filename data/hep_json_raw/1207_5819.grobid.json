Selected events contain one reconstructed Z \u2192 e + e \u2212 or Z \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 candidate and at least two jets, including at least one jet identified as likely to contain a b quark. To validate the search procedure, we also measure the cross section for ZZ production in the same final state. It is found to be consistent with its SM prediction. We set upper limits on the ZH production cross section times branching ratio for H \u2192 bb at the 95% C.L. for Higgs boson masses 90 \u2264 MH \u2264 150 GeV. The observed (expected) limit for MH = 125 GeV is 7.1 (5.1) times the SM cross section. In the standard model (SM), the spontaneous breaking of the electroweak gauge symmetry generates masses for the W and Z bosons and produces a residual massive particle, the Higgs boson [1]. Precision electroweak data, including the latest W boson mass measurements from the CDF [2] and D0 [3] collaborations, and the latest Tevatron combination for the top quark mass [4] constrain the mass of the SM Higgs boson to M H < 152 GeV [5] at the 95% confidence level (C.L.). Direct searches at the CERN e + e \u2212 Collider (LEP) [6], by the CDF and D0 collaborations at the Fermilab Tevatron pp Collider [7], and by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) [8,9] further restrict the allowed range to 116.6 < M H < 119.4 GeV and 122.1 < M H < 127.0 GeV. The ATLAS and CMS results indicate excesses above background expectations at M H \u2248 125 GeV. With additional data and analysis improvements, the LHC experiments confirm their initial indications and observe a particle with properties consistent with those predicted for the SM Higgs boson [10].",

We scale the tt cross section to approximate next-to-NLO [26] and the inclusive Z boson cross section I: Expected and observed event yields for all lepton channels combined after requiring two leptons (inclusive), after also requiring at least two jets (pretag), and after requiring exactly one (ST) or at least two (DT) b-tags. The ZH signal yields are for MH = 125 GeV. The uncertainties quoted on the total background for ST and DT and signal include the statistical and systematic uncertainties. to next-to-NLO [27] and apply additional NLO heavyflavor corrections to the Z + bb and Z + cc samples, calculated from mcfm to be 1.52 and 1.67, respectively. To improve the modeling of the p T distribution of the Z boson, we reweight simulated Z+jets events to be consistent with the measured p T spectrum of Z bosons in data [28]. We correct the energies of simulated jets to reproduce the resolution and energy scale observed in data [29]. We apply the trigger efficiencies, measured in the data, as event weights to the simulated \u00b5\u00b5, \u00b5\u00b5 trk and ee ICR events. In the ee channel, we have verified that the trigger efficiency is consistent with 100% for our selection. We apply scale factors to account for differences in reconstruction efficiency between the data and simulation. Motivated by a comparison with data [30] and the sherpa generator [31], we reweight the Z+jets events to improve the alpgen modeling of the distributions of the \u03b7 of the two jets.",

These include the p T of the two b-jet candidates and the dijet mass, before and after the jet energies are adjusted by the kinematic fit. In the first step, we train a dedicated RF (tt RF) that takes tt as the only background and ZH as the signal. This approach takes advantage of the characteristic signature of the tt background, for instance the presence of large missing transverse energy. In the second step, we use the tt RF to define two independent regions: a tt enriched region (tt RF < 0.5) and a tt depleted region (tt RF \u2265 0.5). The tt depleted region contains 94% (93%) of the DT (ST) signal contribution and 55% (82%) of DT (ST) background events. In each region, we train a global RF to separate the ZH signal from all backgrounds.
