This quantity can be determined in DIS through the photon-gluon fusion process, in which two analysis methods may be used: (i) identifying open charm events or (ii) selecting events with high p T hadrons. The data used in the present work were collected in the COMPASS experiment, where a 160 GeV/c naturally polarised muon beam, impinging on a polarised nucleon fixed target is used. Preliminary results for the gluon polarisation from high p T and open charm analyses are presented. The gluon polarisation result for high p T hadrons is divided, for the first time, into three statistically independent measurements at LO. The result from open charm analysis is obtained at LO and NLO. In both analyses a new weighted method based on a neural network approach is used.",

The \u03bb factor relates the partonic asymmetries and the fractions of the involving processes. During the data selection process it is not possible to identify the process that originated each event, neither to access its partonic variables. Therefore the partonic asymmetries and the process fractions need to be estimated using a dedicated and well tuned Monte Carlo (MC) simulation. The quality of the simulation is illustrated by the comparison of the distributions for three variables in the presented at the conference slides. In the high p T analysis a Bayesian Neural Network (NN) [7] approach was used. The purpose of such approach is to assign a event probability for each process involved: LP, QCD Compton and PGF. These probabilities represent the process fractions in (1). Also the NN is used to provide the partonic asymmetries and x C and x G variables. The gluon polarisation is calculated in an event by event basis using an optimal weight which improves the figure of merit.",

The Q 2 < 1 (GeV/c) 2 regime represents the quasi-real photon, in such conditions the photon may exhibit some inner structure.

Taking into account all the possible muon target spin configurations and the unknown variables a set of equations is derived from the expression (3). This equation set is solved by \u03c7 2 minimisation. As in high p T analysis, the gluon polarisation calculation is performed event by event with an appropriate weight. Still to solve this equation system the partonic asymmetry a LL and the signal significance S S+B must be estimated for every event. To compute the partonic asymmetry a LL a dedicated MC simulation is used. A NN approach is designed to parametrise the partonic asymmetry and the signal significance S S+B as a function of the kinematics. The latter represents the event probability for having D 0 particles. Details about this analysis can be found in [10]. A NLO QCD analysis was also performed. Into the analysing power NLO QCD virtual and gluon bremstrahlung corrections were included to the PGF process, as well as background processes.",
