Results are used to guide the selection of a subsample enriched in quasielastic \u03bd\u00b5Fe interactions, containing an estimated 123,000 quasielastic events of incident energies 1 < E\u03bd < 8 GeV, with E\u03bd = 2.79 GeV. Four additional subsamples representing topological and kinematic sideband regions to quasielastic scattering are also selected for the purpose of evaluating backgrounds. Comparisons using subsample distributions in four-momentum transfer Q 2 show the Monte Carlo model to be inadequate at low Q 2 . Its shortcomings are remedied via inclusion of a Q 2 -dependent suppression function for baryon resonance production, developed from the data. A chi-square fit of the resulting Monte Carlo simulation to the shape of the Q 2 distribution for the quasielastic-enriched sample is carried out with the axial-vector mass MA of the dipole axial-vector form factor of the neutron as a free parameter. The effective MA which best describes the data is 1.23 +0.13   \u22120.09 (fit) +0.12 \u22120.15 (syst.) GeV.",

            "text": "Recent measurements of neutrino interactions in nuclei have challenged our understanding of how neutrinonucleon scattering is modified when the target nucleons are entangled within a nuclear binding potential. Cross section discrepancies relative to \u03bd \u00b5 N and \u03bd \u00b5 N scattering on free nucleons are particularly apparent for charged current (CC) neutrino-nucleus interactions initiated by neutrinos in the energy range of E \u03bd from 0.5 to a few GeV [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9]. Meanwhile, the accuracy of neutrino interaction models is becoming increasingly important to the analysis of neutrino flavor oscillation experiments, especially for CC interactions. The detector configurations deployed in neutrino oscillation experiments have given rise to new, high statistics neutrino scattering measurements on carbon and oxygen nuclei. The results to date have made it clear that models tuned primarily on lightliquid bubble-chamber data do not provide precise descriptions of neutrino-nucleus interactions [10,11].",

The neutrino interaction model of NEUGEN3 provides an overall characterization of neutrino CC interactions at incident energies of a few GeV. The analysis makes use of fits to the shapes of Q 2 distributions in the selected event samples.

The downside is that the M A value determined from the data is an effective parameter only indirectly related to the axial-vector form factor of the neutron. However, since previous work in this field was based on similar formalism, the approach taken here allows straightforward comparison of its determination for \u03bd \u00b5 Fe scattering to previous M A results obtained with light target nuclei.",

The functional forms A(Q 2 ), B(Q 2 ), and C(Q 2 ) contain terms with various combinations of the nucleon vector form factors and the nucleon axial-vector form factor F A (Q 2 ); their explicit forms are given in Ref.

Additionally there are terms within A(Q 2 ) and B(Q 2 ) which contain the pseudoscalar form factor F P (Q 2 ). These however have a negligible effect in the present analysis and are ignored. According to conventional phenomenology the vector form factors satisfy the conserved vector current (CVC) hypothesis [15] and therefore are directly related to the Sachs electric and magnetic form factors [16]. The latter form factors have been well measured by electron scattering experiments. The coupling strength of the axial-vector form factor at zero four-momentum transfer, F A (Q 2 = 0), is well known from neutron \u03b2-decay experiments. Consequently a full description of the differential cross section for CCQE scattering hinges upon determination of the axial-vector form factor, F A (Q 2 ).

More recent experiments use parameterizations of vector form factor measurements obtained by electron scattering experiments, a refinement that shifts M A to the lower value of 0.99 GeV [20].",

For this purpose, runs of short duration were taken in which the primary target was situated at positions displaced longitudinally from the nominal; the horn currents were also varied. With each distinct configuration of target location and horn currents, data are obtained for which the transverse and longitudinal momentum spectra of the hadrons focused by the horns, are modified. Consequently the energy spectra for neutrino CC interactions at the detector are different for each run. This enables the simulated descriptions of transverse and longitudinal momentum distributions of produced \u03c0 and K mesons to be adjusted so as to obtain the best agreement with the neutrino event rate spectrum of each run [36]. Hereafter, the MC calculation with the modifications described above is referred to as the flux-tuned MC.",

A relativistic Fermi gas model of the nucleus includes the effects of Fermi motion and Pauli blocking. The RFG model is augmented with inclusion of a high-momentum tail to the distribution of nucleon momentum as proposed by Bodek and Ritchie [47]. This phenomenological augmentation allows a small number of MC events to exhibit kinematics which would not normally ensue with an RFG model; the occurrence of such events is predicted by spectral function models [48]. In the generation of \u03bdFe interactions by NEUGEN3, Pauli blocking is implemented as a rejection imposed upon generated quasielastic and elastic interactions whose recoil protons (or neutrons) are below 251 MeV/c (below 263 MeV/c). For generated events that survive the Pauli blocking step, the finalstate hadrons are then propagated through the nuclear medium and probabilities are assigned to the possible rescatterings according to an intranuclear cascade algorithm intranuke [49]. Via this particle cascade model, the detailed effects of pion and nucleon rescattering processes such as elastic and inelastic scattering, absorption, and charge exchange scattering are accounted for in sim-ulations carried out by the reference MC.",

This formalism takes into account the production of 18 different baryonic states in exclusive-channel reactions; the largest cross sections are those involving the charge states of the \u2206(1232) resonance. For the \u2206(1232) and for other baryon resonances as well, the axial-vector form factor is taken to be the empirical dipole form but with a mass value of M RES A = 1.12 GeV [51]. For the present analysis (as with other MINOS studies), the NEUGEN3 generator does not impose Pauli blocking upon baryon resonance production. In the decay of the various resonance states, the emission of the daughter particles is assumed to proceed isotropically in the rest frame of the parent particle.",

A survey of neutrino interaction data from previous experiments was used to determine the appropriate hadronic mass spectrum (W spectrum) to use with events in this transition region. For events having hadronic mass between 1.7 < W < 2.0 GeV, a good match to data distributions for d\u03c3/dW is achieved by implementing a linear evolution from the Rein-Sehgal exclusive channel treatment to the Bodek-Yang DIS model. For the production of multiparticle hadronic systems as occurs with DIS events, two different approaches are employed. For production of relatively low hadronic masses, final-state particle multiplicities are simulated according to a modified form of KNO scaling [54]. For higher invariant masses, e.g. W > 2.3 GeV, the KNO hadronic shower model is evolved into a pythia/jetset description [55].",

The angular resolution in the MC was compared to the data using two different methods. In one method the reconstructed angles of upstream versus downstream segments were compared at track midpoints, separately for muons from the data and the MC. In the other method, angles of track segments reconstructed in the Near Detector were compared with the reconstructed angle of the same tracks as they exit the upstream MINER\u03bdA detector [59]. Both methods showed the data to have better muon angular resolutions than were represented in the MC. The discrepancy was largest for short tracks (p \u00b5 < 2 GeV/c, \u03c3 = 52 mrad), with reduction (in quadrature) of \u223c14 mrad of smearing from the MC being required to match the data. However it diminished steadily with increasing track length, becoming indiscernible for tracks longer than 130 sampling planes (p \u00b5 > 5 GeV/c).

Note that CC DIS is the dominant process at high energy, and that data-vs-MC agreement correlates with the DIS event rate in all the distributions of Figs. 3, 4, and 5. On the other hand, the apparent data excess relative to the MC around the spectral peak, where CCQE and baryon-resonance production account for a large fraction of the event rate, correlates with apparent excesses in related regions of the other figures.",

This subsample, referred to as the CCQE enhanced sample, serves as the CCQE signal sample for determination of the axial-vector mass and is presented in Sec. IX. Before obtaining the signal sample however, it is useful to elucidate the backgrounds that complicate the study of CCQE interactions. For these purposes, five mutually exclusive subsamples have been extracted from the CC inclusive sample. Four of these serve as kinematic sideband samples to CCQE, providing perspectives and constraints on background reaction categories, while the fifth subsample is the signal sample. An important development, described in Sec. VIII C, is the use of sideband samples enriched in CC baryon resonance production to develop a data-driven correction to the Q 2 distribution of that background reaction category.",

The extent to which the NEUGEN3 neutrino generator accurately describes these background categories is investigated using four non-overlapping subsamples from the CC inclusive event sample. Their extraction from the inclusive CC sample is based upon the hadronic mass W as follows: The overall normalization of the absolute neutrino flux for this exposure is known to have an uncertainty of order 10%. This systematic is dominated by uncertainties in the modeling of hadron production from the graphite target [62,63]. Additionally there are uncertainties associated with the shape of the flux spectrum in regions most relevant to this analysis. To avoid these significant sources of error and their complicated systematics, the analysis forgoes inferences based upon differences in total event rate between data and the MC predictions. Rather, the approach taken is to restrict to shape-only comparisons, with emphasis placed upon the distributions of selected CC sideband and signal event samples in four-momentum transfer, Q 2 . Consequently, in all subsequent Figures showing MC comparisons to data, the MC prediction is shown scaled to the same number of events as in the data for the kinematic range displayed in each plot.

For the high-Q 2 DIS sample, the MC is observed to match the data shape (and its absolute rate as well), for Q 2 from 2.0 to above 5.0 GeV 2 (beyond the range displayed in Fig. 6). Below 2.0 GeV 2 and throughout the region of the low-Q 2 DIS sample, the MC describes the general trend of the data (histogram vs solid circles), however there are discrepancies.

(The DIS scattering model is not affected.) A low-Q 2 suppression effect for CC two-body \u2206(1232) production which extends beyond Q 2 \u223c 0.3 GeV 2 has been invoked in analyses of the MiniBooNE data [5,64,65]. (See also Ref. [66]). The proposed effect resembles the low-Q 2 suppression exhibited by treatments that go beyond the Fermi gas model, such as the Random Phase Approximation (RPA) [23,24,67,68], nuclear spectral functions [69], or the relativistic distorted-wave impulse approximation (RDWIA) as calculated for CCQE interactions [70]. Since the \u2206(1232) and higher mass baryon resonance states are often too short-lived to escape the parent nucleus before decaying, Pauli blocking may account for part of this effect. As discussed below, the analysis finds that a suitable suppression factor is one that removes about 20% of two-body CC \u2206/N * production in the MC model. Of course the introduction of a suppression factor to be included in the MC model prediction has its own sources of uncertainty; these are accounted for in the error treatment of this analysis.",

Also included is an allowance for sensitivity to higher-than-nominal M QE A values of the magnitude determined in this work. This sensitivity enters the construction of the suppression weight through the presence of CCQE background events in the sideband samples. At higher Q 2 the error band reflects uncertainty in the effective turnoff point for the suppression [71]. The suppression function with its error band is shown in Fig. 9. The function is applied to true baryon resonance events generated by the MC that enter the background estimate for the M QE A measurement.

The requirement that final-state muons stop in the detector effectively limits the sample to events with E \u03bd < 8 GeV; the E had restriction improves the sample purity but also removes genuine quasielastic events with large Q 2 . Reconstruction of muon momentum with good angular and momentum resolution is important because analysis of the CCQE enhanced sample can utilize a reconstruction of Q 2 based upon the QE hypothesis and muon kinematics, rather than relying on hadronic calorimetry as is done for the CC inclusive and the kinematic sideband samples. The neutrino energy and Q 2 can be estimated event-by-event by using the reconstructed muon track, under the assumption that each event is in fact a CCQE scatter from a stationary bound neutron.

As an estimator of Q 2 , Q 2 QE of Eq. 8is unbiased for genuine CCQE events, but is biased towards lower values for the baryon resonance background reactions.  QE is due to the restriction imposed on the energy E had of the recoiling hadronic system. In recognition of efficiency reduc-tion at high Q 2 QE , the fitting of the CCQE enhanced sample for M A is restricted to events having reconstructed Q 2 QE in the range 0.0 < Q 2 QE < 1. In Table I and throughout this work, MC processes are labeled according to the interaction type that is 'as born' inside the target nucleus. Thus signal events are events that originate as QE according to the MC, and the number of such events in the data is inferred from the MC. The topologies that emerge from the struck nucleus however, are subject to alterations by final state interactions. Among the as-born baryon resonance events (asborn DIS events), 28% (21%) are devoid of pions upon exiting the struck nucleus. These backgrounds are among the 73% of events in the simulated CCQE enhanced sample for which the final state released from the target nucleus consists solely of a muon plus nucleon(s). (top), and of Q 2 QE (bottom) for CCQE selected data (solid circles) and for the flux-tuned MC (stacked histograms). The MC prediction includes the data-driven suppression weighting for CC baryon resonance production shown in Fig. 9.

In the lower plot, the MC is observed to exceed (fall below) the data for Q 2 QE less than (greater than) 0.2 GeV 2 .",

The k F ermi cutoff acts as an effective low-Q 2 QE suppression parameter. It serves the same purpose as the \u03ba parameter used by MiniBooNE [3,5]. The parameter provides the fit with a proxy equivalent for a treatment of Pauli blocking plus other nuclear effects that are operative at low Q 2 QE . In NEUGEN3, the CCQE kinematics are computed for all possible four-momentum transfers. However generated events having recoil nucleon momenta below the k F ermi limit are rejected. Based on comparisons with models using nuclear spectral functions [69] or using RDWIA [70], additional amounts of suppression produced by increasing k F ermi by as much as 30% are possible in theory. The viability of this elevated parameter range is also supported by comparisons to current models with RPA effects [24,26,29,30], and by the resonance suppression results described in Sec. VIII C. For these reasons k F ermi is allowed to vary above its nominal in accordance with a 1 \u03c3 uncertainty of 30% during iterations of the principal fit. The range of low-Q 2 QE suppression in CCQE accessible via k F ermi is illustrated by the lowest (bold-dash) histogram in Fig. 12. As it turns out (see paragraphs below), the principal fit requires a relatively small amount of additional suppression, from a k F ermi increase of +6%, to describe the data. The low-Q 2 suppression thereby implied to the Q 2 QE distribution of the CCQE enhanced sample is shown in Fig. 12 by the fine-dashed histogram.  Since the MC versus data comparisons of Sec. IX C have shown the low-Q 2 QE regime to be poorly modeled, the fitting of the reconstructed Q 2 QE distribution of the CCQE-enriched sample was carried out using two different configurations. For each configuration, the fitting of the augmented MC prediction to the data is only for the shape of the Q 2 QE distribution; an upper bound of 1.2 GeV 2 is imposed on Q 2 QE for events of either fit. In the principal fit, all events having reconstructed Q 2 QE less than 1.2 GeV 2 were included and the k F ermi parameter was allowed to vary. The best-fit values thereby obtained are given in the upper row of Table II. The principal fit yields a reduced \u03c7 2 per degree of freedom of 0.79; the uncertainty on the best-fit M A value due solely to statistical effects is \u00b10.07 GeV.",

For all trials the best-fit values for M A and for the nuisance parameters were observed to remain within the 1\u03c3 error range of the nominal value. The main uncertainties are associated with nucleon absorption, pion absorption, and with the hadron formation time. (The formation time determines the point at which a produced hadron acquires its full scattering cross section.) Uncertainties with other parameters are either negligible or strongly correlated with the errors of these three processes. The quadrature sum from the individual (maximum magnitude) variations to M A induced by parameter variations for these three intranuclear rescattering processes is taken as the overall error estimate listed in the first row of Table III. 2. CCQE selection using visible hadronic energy: The primary CCQE selection requires the reconstructed energy of the hadronic system recoiling from the muon to be less than 225 MeV. This cut removes most CC DIS events since these processes tend to have relatively large E had values. It also reduces the amount of CC baryon resonance production which remains as a background. The cut value chosen lies at the midpoint of an E had range characterized by small and regular changes in sample purity and in MC-vs-data discrepancy with incremental variation in E had . This region of relative stability extends for \u00b175 MeV on either side of the designated cut value at 225 MeV. The uncertainty inherent to placement of the cut is evaluated using a set of trial fits of the MC to data in which the assigned E had cut value is stepped from 150 Mev to 300 MeV.

VII B, a Q 2 QE -dependent weight is applied to MC events of the CCQE enhanced sample to ensure that muon angular resolution of the MC represents the resolution observed in the data. The required correction is found to be nearly identical across all subsamples of the analysis; the method of correction is insensitive to the underlying M A in a sample. The determination of MC-vs-data resolution difference per bin of muon track length has uncertainties, and these define the error envelope associated with the correction weight applied to MC events. The one-sigma variations allowed by the envelope impart an uncertainty to the M A determination of the amount shown in row 7 of Table III. 8. NuMI flux tuning parameters: The NuMI flux calculation used by the MC includes tuned parame-ter settings that characterize the beam optics and the production of hadrons from the primary target [36]. Changes of \u00b11\u03c3 are considered for each beam-optics parameter; also considered are the differences between calculated versus data-tuned settings for the hadro-production parameters. By design, the analysis is insensitive to the absolute scale of the neutrino flux, and the distribution shape for Q 2 QE is also fairly insensitive to uncertainties in the spectral shape of the neutrino flux. Consequently these flux uncertainties give a sub-percent contribution to the systematic error budget. Referring to Table III: For each error source (left-hand column), the shifts in the axial-vector mass from the best-fit nominal value (lower row of Table II) are presented in the second and third columns of Table III for systematic parameter variations of +1\u03c3 and \u22121\u03c3 respectively.

The MINOS value, together with the K2K and MiniBooNE results, are consistent with interpretations [10,21,24,30] that large values for the effective M A reflect nuclear medium effects not accounted for using the Fermi gas treatment of the nucleus.

For all distributions, comparisons are given to predictions of an MC simulation based upon conventional phenomenology with neutrinos interacting with quasi-free nucleons in a nucleus modeled as a relativistic Fermi gas. From these comparisons it is inferred that CC baryon resonance production, the principal background to CCQE, is subject to a Q 2 -dependent suppression of rate with the functional form shown in Fig. 9. With inclusion of this suppression effect into the MC simulation, the Q 2 distribution for CCQE scattering in iron is found to be well-described using an effective axial-vector mass with the value given in Eq.
