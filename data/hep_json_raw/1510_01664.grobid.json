It is characterised by the differences in mass, \u2206M , and width, \u2206\u0393, between the mass eigenstates. In the charm system these are usually expressed in a reduced form, x \u2261 \u2206M/\u0393 and y \u2261 \u2206\u0393/(2\u0393), where \u0393 is the average of the two widths.",

            "text": "Mixing in charm has been observed with a significance above five standard deviations in several independent measurements [1][2][3][4] and the constraints on (x, y) are now rather precise [5]. However, most of the measurements are sensitive to (x 2 + y 2 ) or to y (in the limit of negligible CP violation), leading to an ambiguity in the sign of x. One approach to resolve this ambiguity is to exploit the decay to the three-body, self-conjugate final state D 0 \u2192 K 0 S \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 [6][7][8]. The advantage of decays such as D 0 \u2192 K 0 S \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 is that both Cabibbo-favoured (CF) and doubly Cabibbo-suppressed (DCS) components are present in the same final state. Therefore the strong phase differences between contributing amplitudes -and hence between mixed and unmixed decays -can be measured with an amplitude analysis [7][8][9][10] of the same data sample used to obtain the mixing parameters. This is the approach that has JHEP04(2016)033 been used to date. A second method, proposed in ref. [11] and building upon a related approach for determining the unitarity triangle angle \u03b3 [12], uses measurements of the average strong phase difference in regions of the phase space. These can be obtained from an e + e \u2212 collider operating at the \u03c8(3770) resonance. CLEO has made suitable measurements [13] and a similar study could be carried out with the larger BESIII [14] \u03c8(3770) sample. The advantage of this second method is that no amplitude analysis is needed: the systematic uncertainty associated with the amplitude model is replaced with the uncertainty on the strong phase measurements. It has been estimated that with BESIII data this external uncertainty should be smaller than the statistical uncertainty for D 0 \u2192 K 0 S \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 yields of up to 10-20 million [15], far larger than those available today. This paper describes the first measurement of x and y with this novel method, using promptly produced charm mesons in the decay chain D * + \u2192 D 0 \u03c0 + , D 0 \u2192 K 0 S \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , K 0 S \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 (charge conjugate processes are included implicitly unless otherwise noted). A sample of pp collision data recorded by the LHCb experiment in 2011 is used, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1.0 fb \u22121 at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV.",

The detector includes a high-precision tracking system consisting of a silicon-strip vertex detector surrounding the pp interaction region, a large-area silicon-strip detector located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4 Tm, and three stations of silicon-strip detectors and straw drift tubes placed downstream of the magnet. The tracking system provides a measurement of momentum, p, of charged particles with a relative uncertainty that varies from 0.5% at low momentum to 1.0% at 200 GeV/c. The minimum distance of a track to a primary vertex, the impact parameter (IP), is measured with a resolution of (15 + 29/p T ) \u00b5m, where p T is the component of the momentum transverse to the beam, in GeV/c. Different types of charged hadrons are distinguished using information from two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors. Photons, electrons and hadrons are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter and a hadronic calorimeter. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers. The online event selection is performed by a trigger [18], which consists of a hardware stage, based on information from the calorimeter and muon systems, followed by a software stage, which applies a full event reconstruction. At the hardware trigger stage, events are required to have a muon with high p T or a hadron, photon or electron with high transverse energy in the calorimeters. In the subsequent software trigger, pairs of oppositely charged tracks are combined to form K 0 S candidates, and those are in turn combined with a second pair of oppositely charged tracks to form D 0 candidates.

The impact parameter \u03c7 2 , \u03c7 2 IP , is defined as the difference in the vertex fit \u03c7 2 of the associated PV with and without the D 0 candidate. It is used to separate prompt charm that originates at the PV from secondary charm produced at a displaced vertex. The dominant source of secondary charm is from decays of b-hadrons. Two other variables are also used to describe the per-event decay time acceptance function, introduced in section 4.3. Unless otherwise specified, all data passing the selection described in section 3 are used. Where reference is made to a narrow signal window in m D or \u2206m, this corresponds to a stricter requirement: \u00b120 MeV/c 2 around the known D 0 mass, or 144. First, an extended maximum likelihood fit to the m D distribution of all selected D * + candidates is performed to determine the amounts of D 0 signal and combinatorial background in the narrow m D signal window (section 4.2). Second is a maximum likelihood fit to the (t D , ln \u03c7 2 IP ) distribution of those candidates in the narrow m D signal window, using the mass sidebands to estimate the background distributions (section 4.4). This fit uses the yields determined in the first fit, and serves to determine the ln \u03c7 2 IP shapes for prompt and secondary charm. It is not sensitive to mixing. Third is a set of 32 extended maximum likelihood fits, each to the (m D , \u2206m) distribution in a particular phase space bin, with the D * + and D * \u2212 samples fitted separately (section 4.5). Each fit provides measurements of the amounts of signal and background in the narrow (m D , \u2206m) window for the corresponding bin. Fourth is a simultaneous maximum likelihood fit to the (t D , ln \u03c7 2 IP ) distributions of candidates for the 32 subsamples (section 4.6). Signal candidates are required to lie in the narrow m D and \u2206m signal windows, with the mass sidebands used to constrain the combinatorial background.

The criteria for this analysis are given in section 3. (In practice they are applied to the measured rather than the true decay time; the resolution is neglected and considered as a systematic effect (section 5).) Those criteria can be tested again after modifying the candidate -specifically, with a different decay time. By repeatedly testing the criteria for many decay time values spanning the allowed range, the acceptance function for an individual candidate may be determined empirically. Aside from a correction factor discussed later in this section, the value of this function is 1 for those decay times at which all of the criteria are fulfilled, and 0 at all other times. Since candidates with t D < 0.3 ps are rejected, the acceptance function is zero below that point. It must also be zero at very large decay times, both because of the upper bound on t D and because of the finite length of the vertex detector. Therefore, the acceptance function will take the form of a top-hat function",

Second, the decay time acceptance depends only on the D 0 reconstruction and selection: it is not affected by the soft pion and D * + requirements. Third, the full vertex detector pattern recognition is not re-run when changing the D 0 decay time; instead, the changes to the decay geometry are made analytically. Requirements on the number of hits on a track in the vertex detector subsystem are approximated as requirements that the modified trajectory pass through a corresponding number of subdetector modules. Finally, an additional correction factor \u03b5(t D ) is applied to the acceptance function to model the effect of a track quality cut in the reconstruction, which reduces the efficiency for tracks produced further from the beam axis.

The impact of neglecting variation in efficiency as a function of position in the Dalitz plot is assessed by generating pseudoexperiments with a nonuniform efficiency model, determined with full simulation, and fitting them with the baseline procedure. The efficiency is described by a polynomial function and the following variations are tested: the order of the polynomial, whether or not it is required to be symmetric about the leading diagonal in the Dalitz plot, and the use of a different event selection. The variation among models in the values of x and y is smaller than the systematic uncertainties quoted, which are based on the variation with respect to the baseline fit; in particular, the variation in x among the models is approximately 0.01\u00d710 \u22122 . The uncertainty associated with the model of the tracking efficiency correction \u03b5(t D ), discussed in section 4.3, is assessed by allowing higher-order terms in the model. Due to the absence of a K 0 S mass constraint, a small fraction of events fall outside the expected Dalitz plot boundary in the baseline procedure and an algorithm is used to assign them to a nearby bin; the effect of this is tested by instead rejecting all such events.

The second uncertainties are systematic. The correlation coefficient between x and y for the first uncertainty is +0.37, and the systematic uncertainties are considered uncorrelated. The analysis prefers a negative value of x, but positive values are not excluded. The current HFAG world averages [5] are x = (+0.37 \u00b1 0.16) \u00d7 10 \u22122 and y = (+0.66 +0.07 \u22120.10 ) \u00d7 10 \u22122 .

The statistical uncertainty will be be reduced substantially by the addition of the 2012 data sample due to improvements in the software trigger, which now accepts D 0 \u2192 K 0 S \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decays in which the K 0 S vertex lies outside the vertex detector, as occurs in the majority of cases. A further improvement may be obtained if charm mesons produced in semileptonic b-hadron decays are incorporated. The method does not require a detailed model of the efficiency as a function of position in the phase space, and the decay time acceptance is determined from data. Thus, the method does not rely on the extensive use of Monte Carlo simulation. This is crucial for future analyses, especially in the context of the planned LHCb upgrade where O(10 8 ) signal events are expected [40]. To take full advantage of such a data set, more precise strong phase measurements from a charm factory running on the \u03c8(3770) resonance will be needed.",
