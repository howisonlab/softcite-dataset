            "text": "A study of charged-current muon neutrino scattering on hydrocarbon (CH) in which the final state includes a muon, at least one proton, and no pions is presented. Although this signature has the topology of neutrino quasielastic scattering from neutrons, the event sample contains contributions from quasielastic and inelastic processes where pions are absorbed in the nucleus. The analysis accepts events with muon production angles up to 70 \u2022 and proton kinetic energies greater than 110 MeV. The cross section, when based completely on hadronic kinematics, is well-described by a relativistic Fermi gas nuclear model including the neutrino event generator modeling for inelastic processes and particle transportation through the nucleus. This is in contrast to the quasielastic cross section based on muon kinematics, which is best described by an extended model that incorporates multi-nucleon correlations. This measurement guides the formulation of a complete description of neutrino-nucleus interactions that encompasses the hadronic as well as the leptonic aspects of this process.",

            "text": "Neutrino quasielastic scattering \u03bd l N (n) \u2192 l \u2212 p on nuclei N is a dominant signal process for neutrino oscillation experiments and is used to extract information about the axial vector form factor for nucleons [1][2][3][4][5]. The simple final-state topology combined with an assumption that the initial-state nucleon is at rest allows for an estimate of the neutrino energy from the final-state lepton kinematics alone. This estimate can be altered by the fact that the nucleon is bound in a nucleus, which is often modeled by assuming that the nucleons are non-interacting within a relativistic Fermi gas (RFG). However, measurements based on the final-state lepton on nuclei with A > 2 over different ranges of four-momentum transfer Q 2 are inconsistent with the RFG model with M A \u223c 1 GeV in the absolute size of the cross section per nucleon and the predicted energy deposition near the vertex of these interactions [1,2,[5][6][7][8].",

The data are compared to GENIE predictions of the QE-like signal and backgrounds, where the background estimates have been tuned using the data. The largest background comes from baryon resonance production, predominantly \u2206(1232). A smaller background originates from non-resonant inelastic pion production, which is referred to as deep-inelastic scattering (DIS) in GENIE. In the tuning procedure, the non-QE-like backgrounds are categorized as one of two processes: \"resonant\" or \"DIS plus other\" (hereafter denoted DIS+), where the \"other\" includes \u03bd \u00b5 interactions and a smaller neutral current component. Four distinct sideband regions of the E extra distribution are used to extract normalization constants for each process. The sidebands further from the signal region are predicted to contain a larger estimated fraction of DIS+ relative to the reso- nant fraction and are more consistent with the data. By separating the simulated backgrounds into two processes, the backgrounds in each Q 2 QE,p bin are determined from a linear fit that simultaneously matches the simulated background to data in all sideband regions. The tuning results indicate that the baryon resonance production background should be reduced by roughly 50%. The DIS+ background prediction remains nearly unchanged for Q 2 QE,p > 0. After subtracting the data-tuned backgrounds, the yield is corrected for detector smearing of the leading proton energy via a Bayesian unfolding procedure using four iterations [41]. The simulation is used to correct for geometric acceptance and efficiency for the unfolded distribution. To obtain the flux-averaged differential cross section, the yields are divided by the number of nucleons in the fiducial volume (3.294 \u00d7 10 30 ) and the integrated \u03bd \u00b5 flux below 100 GeV (3.286 \u00d7 10 \u22128 /cm 2 /POT).",

            "text": "The uncertainty on the beam flux affects the normalization of d\u03c3/dQ 2 QE,p and is correlated across Q 2 QE,p bins. The uncertainties on the neutrino interaction and FSI models affect d\u03c3/dQ 2 QE,p through the efficiency correction and are dominated by uncertainties on the resonance production axial mass parameter, pion absorption, and pion inelastic scattering. The uncertainties associated with hadron propagation through MINERvA are evaluated by shifting the pion and proton total inelastic cross sections by 10%, an uncertainty derived from external hadron production data [42][43][44][45]. This uncertainty affects proton tracking and PID efficiencies and acceptance for Q 2 QE,p > 0.8 GeV 2 . The systematic uncertainty from the detector energy response is relatively small and is dominated by uncertainties on the reconstruction of the proton and E extra . bin, with contributions from (I) neutrino beam flux, (II) neutrino interaction models, (III) final-state interaction models, (IV) detector energy response, (V) hadronic inelastic cross section model, and (VI) other sources. The absolute uncertainties are followed by the shape uncertainties in parentheses. The QE-like differential cross section 1 as a function of Q 2 QE,p is shown in Fig. 4 (top), along with predictions from the GENIE and NuWro [46,47] generators using a RFG model. Several extensions to the NuWro QE RFG prediction are shown, inspired by measurements based on lepton kinematics. Each prediction represents the sum over all reactions with at least one >110 MeV proton and no pions in the final state. The inelastic contributions to this QE-like cross section from the GENIE (dark dashed) and NuWro (light dashed) predictions are shown, and differ in both rate and shape. For both generators, the inelastic component is dominated by \u2206(1232) production and decay, where the pion is absorbed by the residual nucleus.",

For both the absolute and the shape comparisons, the \u03c7 2 between the data and each prediction, including correlations be-tween bins, is given in Table II. The highest Q 2 QE,p data point contributes mostly to the total \u03c7 2 for the GENIE RFG and NuWro RFG with RPA+Nieves. The remaining predictions get most of their total \u03c7 2 from the middle data points, which have higher and positive covariance values, but these predictions visibly have an opposite trend to the data. The rate and shape of the data are best described by the GENIE RFG model with the inelastic component, followed by the NuWro RFG model with its very different prediction of the inelastic process. The remaining NuWro predictions become more discrepant with the shape of the data, as various implementations of nuclear effects are incorporated.",

For the NuWro RPA calculation [12], the suppression happens below MINERvA's proton kinetic energy threshold, and its curve is nearly identical to NuWro RFG prediction as shown in Fig. 4. MEC between nucleons enhance the cross section and populate the transition region between the QE and \u2206 peaks. MEC are part of both the microscopic model of Nieves [13,21] and the Transverse Enhancement Model (TEM) which is empirically extracted from electron scattering data [18]. TEM is based on QE lepton kinematics so that the energy transfer follows from reweighting QE events rather than filling the transition region between the QE and \u2206 peaks, while the Nieves model gives systematically higher energy transfers which translate to an enhancement at higher proton energies. The proton kinematics are not explicitly calculated in either the TEM or the Nieves model, and in NuWro are assigned as described in Refs. [20,47].",
