The mass of the top quark in the modified minimal subtraction (MS) renormalization scheme is extracted from a comparison of the differential top quark-antiquark (tt) cross section as a function of the invariant mass of the tt system to next-to-leading-order theoretical predictions. The differential cross section is determined at the parton level by means of a maximum-likelihood fit to distributions of final-state observables. The analysis is performed using tt candidate events in the e \u00b1 \u03bc \u2213 channel in proton-proton collision data at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV recorded by the CMS detector at the CERN LHC in 2016, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 . The extracted running is found to be compatible with the scale dependence predicted by the corresponding renormalization group equation. In this analysis, the running is probed up to a scale of the order of 1 TeV.",

As a result, these parameters depend on the scale at which they are evaluated. The evolution of \u03b1 S and of the quark masses as a function of the scale, commonly referred to as \"running\", is described by renormalization group equations (RGEs).",

            "text": "The running of \u03b1 S was experimentally verified on a wide range of scales using jet production in electron-proton, positron-proton, electron-positron, proton-antiproton, and proton-proton (pp) collisions, as summarized, e.g. in Refs. [1,2]. To determine the running, the value of \u03b1 S evaluated at an arbitrary reference scale is extracted in bins of a physical energy scale Q and then converted to \u03b1 S (Q ) using the corresponding RGE [2]. The validity of this procedure lies in the fact that, in a calculation, the renormalization scale is normally identified with the physical energy scale of the process. The same procedure can be used to determine the running of the mass of a quark. In the modified minimal subtraction (MS) renormalization scheme, the dependence of a quark mass m on the scale \u03bc is described by the RGE E-mail address: cms -publication -committee -chair @cern .ch. \u03bc 2 dm(\u03bc) d\u03bc 2 = \u2212\u03b3 (\u03b1 S (\u03bc)) m(\u03bc), (1) where \u03b3 (\u03b1 S (\u03bc)) is the mass anomalous dimension, which is known up to five-loop order in perturbative QCD [3,4]. The solution of Eq. (1) can be used to obtain the quark mass at any scale \u03bc from the mass evaluated at an initial scale \u03bc 0 . The running of the b quark mass was demonstrated [5] using data from various experiments at the CERN LEP [6][7][8][9], SLAC SLC [10], and DESY HERA [11] colliders. Measurements of charm quark pair production in deep inelastic scattering at the DESY HERA were used to determine the running of the charm quark mass [12]. These measurements represent a powerful test of the validity of perturbative QCD. Furthermore, RGEs can be modified by contributions from physics beyond the standard model, e.g. in the context of supersymmetric theories [13].",

            "text": "In events with at least two jets, the invariant mass of the tt system is estimated by means of the kinematic reconstruction algorithm described in Ref. [33]. The reconstructed invariant mass is indicated with m reco tt . The kinematic reconstruction algorithm examines all possible combinations of reconstructed jets and leptons and solves a system of equations under the assumptions that the invariant mass of the reconstructed W boson is 80.4 GeV and that the missing transverse momentum originates solely from the two neutrinos coming from the leptonic decays of the W bosons. In addition, the kinematic reconstruction algorithm requires an assumption on the value of the top quark mass, m kin t . Any possible bias due to the choice of this value is avoided by incorporating the dependence on m kin t in the fit described in Section 4. To estimate this dependence, the kinematic reconstruction and the event selection are repeated with three different choices of m kin t , corresponding to 169.5, 172.5, and 175.5 GeV, and the top quark mass used in the MC simulation, m MC t , is varied accordingly. The parameter m kin t = m MC t is then treated as a free parameter of the fit. The sources of systematic uncertainties are classified as experimental and modelling uncertainties. Experimental uncertainties are related to the corrections applied to the MC simulation. These include uncertainties associated with trigger and lepton identification efficiencies, jet energy scale [34] and resolution [35], lepton energy scales, b tagging efficiencies [22], and the uncertainty in the integrated luminosity [36]. Modelling uncertainties are related to the simulation of the tt signal, and include matrix-element scale variations in the powheg simulation [37,38], scale variations in the parton shower [31], variations in the matching scale between the matrix element and the parton shower [30], uncertainties in the underlying event tune [30], the PDFs [39], the B hadron branching fraction and fragmentation function [40,41], and uncertainties related to the choice of the colour reconnection model [42,43]. Furthermore, as in previous CMS analyses, e.g. [14,44,45], an uncertainty that accounts for the observed difference in the shape of the top quark p T distribution between data and simulation [33,46,47] is applied. The dependence on the top quark width has been investigated and was found to be negligible. Other sources of uncertainty include the modelling of the additional pp interactions within the same or nearby bunch crossings and the normalization of background processes. For the latter, an uncertainty of 30% is assigned to the normalization of each background process. Further details on the sources of systematic uncertainties and the considered variations can be found in Ref. [14].",

In the calculation, the renormalization scale, \u03bc r , and factorization scale, \u03bc f , are both set to m t . The MS mass of the top quark evaluated at the scale \u03bc = m t is denoted with m t (m t ). The calculation is interfaced with the ABMP16_5_nlo PDF set [54], which is the only available PDF set where m t is treated in the MS scheme and where the correlations between the gluon PDF, \u03b1 S , and m t are taken into account. In the calculation, the value of \u03b1 S at the Z boson mass, \u03b1 S (m Z ), is set to the value determined in the ABMP16_5_nlo fit, which in the central PDF corresponds to 0.1191 [54]. In order to demonstrate the sensitivity to the top quark mass, predictions for d\u03c3 tt /dm tt obtained with different values of m t (m t ) are shown. Furthermore, it is worth noting that this method provides a cross section result with significantly improved precision compared to measurements that perform unfolding as a separate step, e.g. as the one described in Ref.

Here, the fit uncertainty (fit), the combination of PDF and \u03b1 S uncertainty (PDF+\u03b1 S ), and the extrapolation uncertainty (extr) are given. The most relevant sources of experimental uncertainty are the integrated luminosity, the lepton identification efficiencies, and the jet energy scale and resolution. Among modelling uncertainties related to the powheg+pythia 8 simulation of the tt signal, the largest contributions originate from the scale variations in the parton shower, the uncertainty in the shape of the p T spectrum of the top quark, and the matching scale between the matrix element and the parton shower. The statistical uncertainties are found to be negligible. The correlations between the ratios arising from the fit uncertainty are investigated using a pseudo-experiment procedure which consists in repeating the extraction of the ratios using For comparison, the MS mass of the top quark is also extracted from the inclusive cross section measured in Ref. [14], using Hathor 2.0 [57] predictions at NLO interfaced with the ABMP16_5_nlo PDF set, and is denoted with m incl t (m t ). ",

The running is extracted from a measurement of the differential top quark-antiquark (tt) cross section as a function of the invariant mass of the tt system, m tt . The differential tt cross section, d\u03c3 tt /dm tt , is determined at the parton level using a maximum-likelihood fit to distributions of final-state observables, using tt candidate events in the e \u00b1 \u03bc \u2213 channel. This technique allows the nuisance parameters to be constrained simultaneously with the differential cross section in the visible phase space and therefore provides results with significantly improved precision compared to conventional procedures in which the unfolding is performed as a separate step. The analysis is performed using proton-proton collision data at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV recorded by the CMS detector at the CERN LHC in 2016, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 .",

The extracted m t (m t ) are then converted to m t (\u03bc k ) using the CRunDec v3.0 program [56], where \u03bc k is the representative scale of the process in a given bin of m tt , as described in Section 3. As relevant in a NLO calculation, the conversion is performed with one-loop precision, assuming five active flavours (n f = 5) and \u03b1 S (m Z ) = 0.1191 consistently with the used PDF set. This procedure is equivalent to extracting directly m t (\u03bc k ) in each bin. Furthermore, the result does not depend on the exact choice of \u03bc k , provided that it is representative of the physical energy scale of the process.
