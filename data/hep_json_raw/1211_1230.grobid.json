            "text": "Meson-antimeson oscillations are a manifestation of flavor changing neutral currents that occur because the flavor eigenstates differ from the physical mass eigenstates of the meson-antimeson system. Short-range quark-level transitions as well as long-range processes contribute to this phenomenon. The former are governed by loops in which virtual heavy particles are exchanged, making the study of flavor oscillations an attractive area to search for physics beyond the standard model (SM). Oscillations have been observed in the K 0 \u00c0 \" [2], and B 0 s \u00c0 \" B 0 s [3] systems, all with rates in agreement with SM expectations. Evidence of D 0 \u00c0 \" D 0 oscillations has been reported by three experiments using different D 0 decay channels [4][5][6][7][8]. Only the combination of these measurements provides confirmation of D 0 \u00c0 \" D 0 oscillations, also referred to as charm mixing, with more than 5 significance [9]. While it is accepted that charm mixing occurs, a clear observation of the phenomenon from a single measurement is needed to establish it conclusively.",

The analysis is based on a data sample corresponding to 1:0 fb \u00c01 of ffiffi ffi s p \u00bc 7 TeV pp collisions recorded by LHCb during 2011. The LHCb detector [18] is a single-arm forward spectrometer covering the pseudorapidity range 2 < < 5, designed for the study of particles containing b or c quarks. Detector components particularly relevant for this analysis are the silicon Vertex Locator, which provides identification of displaced, secondary vertices of band c-hadron decays; the tracking system, which measures charged particles with momentum resolution \u00c1p=p that varies from 0.4% at 5 GeV=c to 0.6% at 100 GeV=c, corresponding to a typical mass resolution of approximately 8 MeV=c 2 for a two-body charm-meson decay; and the ring imaging Cherenkov detectors, which provide kaon-pion discrimination. Events are triggered by signatures consistent with a hadronic charm decay. The hardware trigger demands a hadronic energy deposition with a transverse component of at least 3 GeV. Subsequent software-based triggers require two oppositely-charged tracks to form a D 0 candidate with a decay vertex well separated from the associated primary pp collision vertex (PV). Additional requirements on the quality of the online-reconstructed tracks, their transverse momenta (p T ) and their impact parameters (IP), defined as the distance of closest approach of the reconstructed trajectory to the PV, are applied in the final stage of the software trigger. For the offline analysis, only D 0 candidates selected by this trigger algorithm are considered.",

The 2 \u00f0IP\u00de is defined as the difference between the 2 of the PV reconstructed with and without the considered particle, and is a measure of consistency with the hypothesis that the particle originates from the PV. Selected D 0 candidates are required to have p T > 3:5 GeV=c and are combined with a track with p T > 300 MeV=c and p > 1:5 GeV=c to form a D \u00c3\u00fe candidate. Contamination from D mesons originating from b-hadron decays (secondary D) is reduced by requiring the 2 \u00f0IP\u00de of the D 0 and of \u00fe s candidates to be smaller than 9 and 25, respectively. In addition, the ring imaging Cherenkov system is used to distinguish between pions and kaons and to suppress the contamination from misidentified two-body charm decays in the sample. Backgrounds from misidentified singly Cabibbo-suppressed decays are specifically removed by requiring the D 0 candidate mass reconstructed under the K \u00fe K \u00c0 and \u00fe \u00c0 hypotheses to differ by more than 40 MeV=c 2 from the known D 0 mass [19]. Contamination from electrons to the soft pion sample is also suppressed using particle identification information. Finally, it is required that the D 0 and the \u00fe s form a vertex, which is constrained to the measured PV. Only candidates with reconstructed K mass within 24 MeV=c 2 of the known D 0 mass and with reconstructed D 0 \u00fe s mass below 2:02 GeV=c 2 are considered further. The D 0 \u00fe s mass, M\u00f0D 0 \u00fe s \u00de, is calculated using the vector sum of the momenta of the three charged particles and the known D 0 and \u00fe masses [19]; no mass hypotheses for the D 0 daughters enter the calculation, ensuring that all two-body signal decays have the same M\u00f0D 0 \u00fe s \u00de distribution [20]. Events with multiple RS or WS D \u00c3\u00fe candidates occur about 2.5% of the time, and all candidates are kept. Figure 1 shows the M\u00f0D 0 \u00fe s \u00de distribution for the selected RS and WS candidates. Overlaid is the result of a binned 2 fit used to separate the D \u00c3\u00fe signal component, with a mass resolution of about 0:3 MeV=c 2 , from the background component, which is dominated by associations of real D 0 decays and random pions. The signal mass shape is modeled as the sum of one Johnson S U [21] and three Gaussian distributions, which account for the asymmetric tails and the central core of the distribution, respectively. The background is described by an empirical function of the form \u00bdM\u00f0D 0 \u00fe s \u00de \u00c0 m 0 a e \u00c0b\u00bdM\u00f0D 0 \u00fe s \u00de\u00c0m 0 , where the threshold m 0 is fixed to the sum of the known D 0 and \u00fe masses [19]. We reconstruct approximately 3:6 \u00c2 10 4 WS and 8:4 \u00c2 10 6 RS decays. To determine the time-dependent WS/RS ratio, the data are divided into thirteen D 0 decay time bins, chosen to have a similar number of candidates in each bin. The decay time is estimated from the distance L between the PV and the D 0 decay vertex and from the D 0 momentum as t= \u00bc m D 0 L=p, where m D 0 and are the known D 0 mass and lifetime [19], respectively. The typical decay-time resolution is $0:1. The signal yields for the RS and WS samples are determined in each decay time bin using fits to the M\u00f0D 0 \u00fe s \u00de distribution. The shape parameters and the 101802-2 yields of the two components, signal and random pion background, are left free to vary in the different decay time bins. We further assume that the M\u00f0D 0 \u00fe s \u00de signal shape for RS and WS decays are the same. Hence, we first perform a fit to the abundant and cleaner RS sample to determine the signal shape and yield, and then, use those shape parameters with fixed values when fitting for the WS signal yield. The signal yields from the thirteen bins are used to calculate the WS/RS ratios, shown in Fig. 2, and the mixing parameters are determined in a binned 2 fit to the time-dependence according to Eq. 1.",

Uncertainties in the distance between Vertex Locator sensors can lead to a bias of the decay-time scale.

The upper bound corresponds to the case when the D 0 decays instantaneously and the reconstructed decay time t is entirely due to the b-hadron lifetime.
