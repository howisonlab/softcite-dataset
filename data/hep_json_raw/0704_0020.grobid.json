Theoretical predictions give estimates of the form factors in exclusive semileptonic B and D meson decays. Precise measurements of the hadronic form factors in D decays can help to validate predictions from QCD calculations in both D and B decays. Better understanding of the form factors in B decays is necessary to improve the precision on the determination of jV cb j and jV ub j. In D 0 !

In this paper we present measurements of the q 2 variation and absolute value of the hadronic form factor at q 2 0 for the decay D 0 ! K \u00ff e e . The data consist of D mesons produced in e e \u00ff ! c c continuum events at a center of mass energy near the 4S mass, and were recorded by the BABAR detector at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center's PEP-II collider. A semi-inclusive reconstruction technique is used to select charm semileptonic decays with high efficiency. As a result of this approach, events with a photon radiated during the D 0 decay are included in the signal. The systematic uncertainties are kept as low as possible by using control samples extracted from data where possible.",

This paper is organized as follows. A general description of the hadronic form factor, f q 2 , is given in Sec. II, where the different parameterizations considered in this analysis are explained. In Section III a short description of the detector components that are important to this measurement is given. The selection of signal events and the rejection of background are considered in Section IV. In Section V, the measured q 2 variation of the hadronic form factor is discussed and compared with previous measurements. In Sec. VI the measured decay rate is given and in Sec.

Charged hadron identification is performed combining the measurements of the energy deposition in the SVT and in the DCH with the information from the Cherenkov detector (DIRC). Photons are detected and measured in the CsI(Tl) electro-magnetic calorimeter (EMC). Electrons are identified by the ratio of the track momentum to the associated energy deposited in the EMC, the transverse profile of the shower, the energy loss in the DCH, and the Cherenkov angle in the DIRC.

These are used mainly to evaluate background components. Quark fragmentation, in continuum events, is described using the JETSET package [23]. The MC distributions have been rescaled to the data sample luminosity, using the expected cross sections of the different components (1 . Dedicated MC samples of pure signal events, equivalent to 7 times the data statistics, are used to correct measurements for efficiency and finite resolution effects.

To account for one of the most important sources of background, a special event sample with, in each event, at least one cascade decay D ! D 0 , D 0 ! K \u00ff 0 e e (or its charge conjugate) has been generated with a parameterization of the form factors in agreement with measurements from the FOCUS Collaboration [25]. Events with a D and a D 0 decaying into K \u00ff or K \u00ff 0 have been reconstructed in data and simulation. These control samples have been used to adjust the c-quark fragmentation distribution and the kinematic characteristics of particles accompanying the D meson in order to better match the data. They have been used also to measure the reconstruction accuracy on the missing neutrino momentum. In addition, K \u00ff events are used as a reference channel in the D 0 !

These variables have been combined linearly in a Fisher discriminant. The requirement F B B > 0:5 retains 65% of signal and 6% of B B-background events.

The uncertainty on this value has been used to evaluate the corresponding systematic uncertainty. (ii) the electron comes from a converted photon or a Dalitz decay (24%). It has been assumed that the simulation correctly accounts for this component; (iii) the K \u00ff does not originate from a charm hadron (14%). This happens usually when there is another negative charged kaon accompanying the D . We have studied the production of charged kaon accompanying a D using D 0 ! K \u00ff events and measure a correction factor of 0:87 0:02 and 0:53 0:02, respectively, for same sign and opposite sign K-D pairs.

Since generic simulated signal events used in this measurement have been generated with the ISGW2 model, they have been weighted so that their q 2 distribution agrees with the measurement presented in this paper. Furthermore, we require for the Fisher discriminant F B B > 0 and restrict m < 0:16 GeV=c 2 . After background subtraction, there remain 76283 323 and 95302 309 events in data and simulation, respectively. This gives ND 0 ! K \u00ff e e data ND 0 ! K \u00ff e e MC 0:8004 0:0043:",
