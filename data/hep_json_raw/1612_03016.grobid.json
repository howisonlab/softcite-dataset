The data were collected in proton-proton collisions at \u221a s = 7 TeV with an integrated luminosity of 4.6 fb \u22121 . Differential W + and W \u2212 cross sections are measured in a lepton pseudorapidity range |\u03b7 | < 2.5. Differential Z /\u03b3 * cross sections are measured as a function of the absolute dilepton rapidity, for |y | < 3.6, for three intervals of dilepton mass, m , extending from 46 to 150 GeV. The integrated and differential electron-and muon-channel cross sections are combined and compared to theoretical predictions using recent sets of parton distribution functions. The data, together with the final inclusive e \u00b1 p scattering cross-section data from H1 and ZEUS, are interpreted in a next-to-next-to-leading-order QCD analysis, and a new set of parton distribution functions, ATLAS-epWZ16, is obtained. The ratio of strange-to-light sea-quark densities in the proton is determined more accurately than in previous determinations based on collider data only, and is established to be close to unity in the sensitivity range of the data. A new measurement of the CKM matrix element |V cs | is also provided.",

The rapidity dependence of boson production in the Drell-Yan process provides constraints on the parton distribution functions (PDFs) of the proton, as the boson rapidity is strongly correlated with the proton momentum fractions x 1 , x 2 carried by the partons participating in the hard scattering subprocess. The weak and electromagnetic components of the neutral current (NC) process, Z /\u03b3 * \u2192 , combined with the weak charged current (CC) reactions, W + \u2192 + \u03bd and W \u2212 \u2192 \u2212\u03bd , probe the quark flavours of the proton in a way that complements the information from deep inelastic lepton-hadron scattering (DIS).",

The precision of that measurement -not including the luminosity uncertainty -reached about 2-3%. The new W \u00b1 , Z cross-section measurement presented here uses the data taken at \u221a s = 7 TeV by ATLAS in 2011. This data sample has a hundred times more integrated luminosity, 4.6 fb \u22121 , measured with an improved precision of 1.8% [2]. A deeper understanding of detector performance and refined analysis techniques are crucial to reach a measurement precision at the sub-percent level, apart from the luminosity uncertainty.",

The NNLO QCD predictions are calculated with kinematic requirements applied to match the detector acceptance using the DYNNLO [24,25] and FEWZ [26][27][28] programs. The NLO electroweak corrections are an important ingredient at this level of precision and can be evaluated with FEWZ for the NC processes and with the SANC programs [29] for both NC and CC processes. The measured integrated and differential cross sections are compared to calculations using various recent PDF sets: ABM12 [30], CT14 [31], HERAPDF2.0 [32], JR14 [33], MMHT14 [34], and NNPDF3.0 [35].

This is re-examined here in a new QCD fit analysis using the present ATLAS measurement together with the final, combined NC and CC DIS crosssection data from the H1 and ZEUS experiments at the HERA collider [32]. The analysis provides a new NNLO PDF set, ATLAS-epWZ16, superseding the ATLAS-epWZ12 set [38]. It also allows the magnitude of the CKM matrix element |V cs | to be determined, without assuming unitarity of the CKM matrix, with a precision comparable to the determinations from charm hadron decays [39].",

The measurements, of both the W \u00b1 and the Z /\u03b3 * reactions, are performed independently for the electron and muon decay channels as described in Sects. 3 and 4. The cross-section results are presented in Sect. 5, which contains the analysis method, a test of electron-muon universality, and a description of the procedure for, and results of, combining the electron and the muon data. In Sect. 6 the integrated and differential cross sections are compared with theoretical calculations using recent NNLO PDF sets. Measurements are also presented of the W \u00b1 charge asymmetry and various other cross-section ratios. This section concludes with the results of the PDF profiling analysis. Finally, Sect. 7 presents an NNLO QCD fit analysis of the present ATLAS data and the final HERA NC and CC DIS cross-section data, resulting in an improved determination of the strange-quark distribution in the proton and a measurement of |V cs |. A summary of the paper is presented in Sect. 8.",

The effect of multiple pp interactions per bunch crossing (\"pileup\") is modelled by overlaying the hard-scattering event with additional simulated inelastic collision events following the distribution observed in the data with about nine simultaneous inelastic interactions on average. These events are simulated using Pythia6 with the AMBT2 tune [73]. While the simulation of pile-up events reproduces the observed width of the luminous region along the beam direction, a reweighting is applied to match the longitudinal distribution of the hardscatter vertex to that observed in the data. This is needed to accurately control acceptance and detector effects, which depend on the details of the detector geometry.",

The electron is required to satisfy \"tight\" identification criteria [74] based on the shower shapes of the cluster of energy in the calorimeter, the track properties, and the trackto-cluster matching. The combined efficiency for electrons from W and Z decays to be reconstructed and to meet these \"tight\" identification criteria depends strongly on both \u03b7 and p T . In the most central region of the detector, at |\u03b7| < 0.8, this efficiency is about 65% at p T = 20 GeV and increases to about 80% at p T = 50 GeV. In the more forward region, 2.0 < |\u03b7| < 2.47, the corresponding efficiencies are in the range 50-75% for transverse momenta p T = 20-50 GeV.",

This last contribution is referred to as the hadronic recoil [75]. The missing transverse momentum, E miss T , is given by the negative vectorial sum of the transverse momentum components of the charged lepton and the hadronic recoil and identified with the undetected neutrino. The E miss T is reconstructed from energy deposits in the calorimeters and muons reconstructed in the MS [76,77]. Calorimeter energy deposits associated to an electron candidate meeting the \"medium\" identification criteria [74] and exceeding p T > 10 GeV are calibrated to the electron scale. Alternatively, if calorimeter energy deposits can be associated to a jet reconstructed with the anti-k t algorithm with radius parameter R = 0.6 and p T > 20 GeV, the calibrated jet is used [78]. Finally, identified combined and isolated muons, as described in Sect. 4, with p T > 10 GeV, are used in the E miss T reconstruction, removing the energy deposits of such muons in the calorimeter. Any remaining energy deposits in the calorimeters are added to the E miss T after calibration with the local hadronic calibration [78].",

This background is estimated from the data using a template fit of the E miss T distribution in a normalization region that differs from the signal region by relaxed the E miss T and m T requirements. A template to represent the multijet background contribution is selected from data using the same kinematic requirements as for signal electrons, but inverting a subset of the electron identification criteria and requiring the electron candidate not to be isolated.

The normalization region contains the signal region to constrain the signal contribution, relaxes the lower E miss T and m T requirements to increase the multijet fraction and furthermore imposes E miss T < 60 GeV to avoid a mismodelling of the high E miss T region, which was established in a study of the Z \u2192 e + e \u2212 sample. No prior knowledge of either template's normalization is assumed, and the fit is performed separately for the W + and W \u2212 channels and also in each bin of electron pseudorapidity to obtain the background for the differential analysis. The resulting E miss T distribution for the case of the inclusive W + selection is shown in the left panel of Fig. 1. The background in the signal region E miss T > 25 GeV and m T > 40 GeV is then obtained by multiplying the multijet yield determined in the fit by the fraction of events in the template sample that satisfy the signal region and normalization region E miss T and m T requirements, respectively. This multijet estimate is found to change in a systematic way when the E miss T and m T requirements imposed for the normalization region are progressively tightened to resemble more the E miss T and m T requirements of the signal region. This dependence is measured and linearly extrapolated to the point where the normalization region has the same E miss T and m T thresholds as the signal region. A corresponding correction of typically 10% is applied to obtain an improved multijet estimate, while the full size of this correction is assigned as a systematic uncertainty. Further systematic uncertainties are derived from variations of the background and signal template shapes. Background shape uncertainties are obtained from varied template selection criteria by changing the E cone30 T / p T selection, requiring the electroncandidate track to have a hit in the innermost layer of the ID, or changing the subset of identification criteria that the electron is allowed to not satisfy from the \"tight\" to the \"medium\" identification level.

The minimum of the value E cone30 T / p T of the two electron candidates is chosen to represent each event, as it was found to provide optimal discrimination. The multijet fraction is then estimated from data by fitting this distribution using a template method similar to the W \u2192 e\u03bd analysis. The background template is selected with inverted electron identification requirements and the signal Z /\u03b3 * \u2192 e + e \u2212 , electroweak and tt templates are taken from simulation. The non-isolated sample where the minimum of E cone30 T / p T of both electrons exceeds a certain value is found to be dominated by multijet background and is used to adjust the normalization of the background template, taking into account the small signal contamination. The right panel of Fig. 1 shows the isolation distribution used to obtain the multijet background in the Z -peak region. This procedure yields a fraction of multijet background decreasing towards larger rapidity with a typical size between 1.9 and 5.0% in the low dielectron mass bin, between 0.14 and 1.6% at high dielectron mass and between 0.02 and 0.15% near the Z peak. Uncertainties are dominated by the statistical uncertainty of the sample containing non-isolated electron candidates and by the sensitivity of the procedure to the threshold applied to the minimum of E cone30 T / p T to select the non-isolated region and amount to typically 20% at and above the Z peak (66 < m < 150 GeV) and 10% below (46 < m < 66 GeV).",

As the associated jet production and fake-electron rates may be poorly modelled by the simulation, the W \u2192 e\u03bd background component is determined by a data-driven procedure. A control region is constructed starting from the nominal forward Z /\u03b3 * \u2192 e + e \u2212 event selection, but removing the Z -peak region m ee = 80-100 GeV and requiring E miss T and m T selections similar to the W \u2192 e\u03bd signal analysis. It is found that the Powheg+Pythia6 W \u2192 e\u03bd samples describe well all relevant kinematic variables such as the invariant mass m ee or dielectron rapidity y ee in the control region after applying an additional normalization factor of 1.6 \u00b1 0.2.

The assigned uncertainty of this scale factor covers systematic uncertainties induced by the extrapolation and is estimated using variations of the control region with different E miss T or m T selections.

Imposing tighter selections on the invariant mass and on the angular correlation between the two muons reduces the background contamination and allows one of the muons to be selected with looser requirements to measure the efficiencies [81]. The reconstruction efficiencies are measured using a factorized approach: the efficiency of the combined reconstruction is derived with respect to the ID tracks, and the efficiency of reconstructing a muon in the inner tracker is measured relative to the MS tracks. The isolation selection efficiency is estimated relative to combined tracks. Finally, the trigger efficiency is measured relative to isolated combined muons.",

For the W \u2192 \u03bc\u03bd channel, the result of the template fit using the E miss T distribution is shown. The vertical line indicates the upper boundary (E miss T = 60 GeV) of the region used in the fit. The label \"EWK+top\" refers to the electroweak and top-quark background contributions esti-mated from MC simulation, which are here treated in a common template together with the W \u2192 \u03bc\u03bd signal. In the Z /\u03b3 * \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 channel, the full p cone40 T / p T distribution is used to normalize the multijet template from data. The sum of all expected background and signal contributions is shown as a solid line with a hashed band detailing the statistical uncertainty and labelled \"total (stat)\" tors are close to unity, indicating that the simulation reproduces detector effects very well. The corrections for the combined reconstruction efficiency are 1-2%, except for a small region around |\u03b7| 1.0 where a larger correction of 6-7% is applied to account for muon chambers simulated but not installed. These correction factors are parameterized in \u03b7 and \u03c6 and they are determined with a 0.1-0.3% relative uncertainty. The efficiency of the isolation requirement is also modelled well in the simulation. The correction is derived as a function of the transverse momentum and is about 1% for p T = 20 GeV and decreases as p T increases to reach about 0.2% for p T > 40 GeV. The relative uncertainty of the isolation efficiency correction is about 0.1-0.3%. A larger correction is needed to account for the mismodelling of the trigger efficiency in simulation, ranging from 5-10%. This is parameterized as a function of \u03b7 and p T and known with a 0.1-0.8% relative uncertainty.",

Alternative templates are also derived from simulation of inclusive heavy-flavour production with semileptonic decays of charm or bottom hadrons to muons. The right panel of Fig. 2 shows the result of the template fit in the muon isolation distribution to determine the absolute scale of the multijet background, which is then extrapolated to the isolated region. For this particular method, the multijet template is modelled by a combination of same-charge data events, used to represent the background from light-quark production, and a contribution from simulated heavy-flavour production, where the small same-charge fraction is subtracted from the dominant opposite-charge dimuon contribution.",

This contribution is calculated including NLO effects for the fiducial phase space with the MCSANC [104] program and subtracted from the unfolded data. The calculation uses the average of the two available MRST2004qed [113] predictions for the photon PDF as the central value and half the difference as an uncertainty estimate. The size of the photoninduced contribution is about 1.5% in the low and high m bins, while it is negligible (<0.1%) at the Z peak.

Predictions computed at NNLO QCD with NLO EW corrections using various PDF sets (open symbols) are compared to the data (full points). The ratio of theoretical predictions to the data is also shown. The predictions are displaced within each bin for better visibility. The theory uncertainty corresponds to the quadratic sum of the PDF uncertainty and the statistical uncertainty of the calculation to NNLO perturbative QCD predictions, including NLO EW corrections. The predictions are evaluated with various PDF sets. At the Z peak, where the highest precision is reached for the data, all predictions are below the data at central rapidity, |y | < 1, but least for the HERAPDF2.0 set, which quotes the largest uncertainties. In the forward region, the PDFs agree well with the measurement, which, however, is only precise to the level of a few percent and thus not very sensitive to differences between PDFs. In the low mass Z /\u03b3 * \u2192 region, Fig. 24, several of the PDF sets exhibit a different rapidity dependence than the data although being mostly consistent with the measurement. This also holds for the central rapidity region at high mass, 116 < m < 150 GeV. The precision of the data in the forward region at high mass is too low to allow discrimination between the various PDF sets, all of which reproduce the measured rapidity dependence within the quoted uncertainties.",

The Drell-Yan and DIS reactions are theoretically very well understood processes for such an analysis, and ep and pp collider data are particularly suitable because of the absence of nuclear corrections and negligible higher-twist effects. The HERA data alone can provide a full set of PDFs with certain assumptions [32]. Adding the ATLAS data provides more sensitivity to the flavour composition of the quark sea as well as to the valence-quark distributions at lower x. The HERA and ATLAS data are used to obtain a new set of PDFs, termed ATLAS-epWZ16. Following the previous, similar QCD fit analysis in Ref. [38], special attention is given to the evaluation of the strangequark distribution, which was found to be larger than previous expectations based on dimuon data in DIS neutrino-nucleon scattering.

The model (mod) and parameterization (par) uncertainties are discussed in Sect. 7.2.1 and the corresponding individual variations of r s are listed separately in Table 19. This result represents an improvement of a factor of three in the experimental uncertainty relative to the ATLAS-epWZ12 fit [38]. The improvement derives from the more precise ATLAS data, which provide the sensitivity to the strange-quark density through the shape of the Z rapidity distribution in combination with the common, absolute normalization of both the W \u00b1 and Z /\u03b3 * cross sections. The model uncertainties are reduced by a factor of three, mainly because of the better control of the charmquark mass parameter from the HERA data [136]. The parameterization uncertainty is determined to be +0.02 \u22120.10 as compared to +0.10 \u22120.15 in the former analysis since the new, more precise data leave less freedom in the parameter choice. The variation to lower r s is dominated by the variation due to adding the Bs parameter which was not accounted for in the previous analysis. The result is thus a confirmation and improvement of the previous observation [38] of an unsuppressed strangequark density in the proton. As a cross-check, a re-analysis of the 2010 data with the present theoretical framework was performed, which yields a value of r s consistent with both the former and the new value.",

The outer band illustrates additional, mostly theoretical uncertainties which are presented below. The result is compared with recent global fit analyses, ABM12, MMHT14, CT14 and NNPDF3.0. All of these predict r s and R s to be significantly lower than unity, with values between about 0.4 and 0.6. Furthermore, these global fit analyses are seen to exhibit substantially different uncertainties in r s and R s due to exploiting different data and prescriptions for fit uncertainties. The new result is in agreement with the previous ATLAS-epWZ12 analysis also shown in Fig. 31. It is also consistent with an earlier analysis by the NNPDF group [63] based on collider data only, which obtains a value near unity, albeit with large uncertainties. 10 A careful evaluation of the value of r s requires the consideration of a number of additional, mostly theoretical uncertainties.

Predictions for the Drell-Yan processes W \u00b1 \u2192 \u03bd and Z /\u03b3 * \u2192 are calculated at NNLO fixed order in QCD and including NLO electroweak corrections. A quantitative comparison of the differential cross sections shows deviations of the predictions obtained with many of the contemporary PDF sets, hinting to a special impact of the data on the determination of the strange-quark distribution.",

A new set of parton distribution functions, termed ATLAS-epWZ16, is provided. A detailed fit analysis supports the previous observation by ATLAS of a large ratio of the strange-quark distribution to the lighter sea-quark distributions at low x. Specifically, the ratio of the strange to the down sea-quark distributions, evaluated at a scale of Q 2 = 1.9 GeV 2 at a mean x = 0.023, is found to be r s = 1.19 with a total uncertainty of 0.16. Experimentally, r s is determined with an uncertainty of 0.07 which is a threefold reduction relative to the previous determination by the ATLAS Collaboration.",

This covers the effects of model, parameterization, and further theoretical uncertainties. Detailed studies are performed regarding the accuracy with which NNLO QCD predictions for the Drell-Yan process can be computed, including the differ-ences in existing codes, DYNNLO and FEWZ, and the effect of the choice of scales. The uncertainties in the strange-quark density from the limitations of NNLO QCD calculations of the fiducial cross sections are found to significantly exceed the experimental errors. An interesting observation is the significant improvement in the description of the ATLAS data when factorization and renormalization scales are set to a half of the canonically used dilepton mass scales. Several crosschecks are presented to evaluate the reliability of the measured enhancement of the strange-quark density. The paper finally presents a determination of the CKM matrix element |V cs | which has a precision comparable to extractions from charm meson decays. ation of the LHC, as well as the support staff from our institutions without whom ATLAS could not be operated efficiently.
