Using 20.3 fb \u22121 of data collected with the ATLAS experiment at the LHC in pp collisions at \u221a s = 8 TeV, the first measurement of associated Z + J/\u03c8 production is presented for both prompt and non-prompt J/\u03c8 production, with both signatures having a significance in excess of 5\u03c3 . The inclusive production cross-sections for Z boson production (analysed in \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 or e + e \u2212 decay modes) in association with prompt and non-prompt J/\u03c8(\u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 ) are measured relative to the inclusive production rate of Z bosons in the same fiducial volume to be (36.8 \u00b1 6.7 \u00b1 2.5) \u00d7 10 \u22127 and (65.8 \u00b1 9.2 \u00b1 4.2) \u00d7 10 \u22127 respectively. Normalised differential production cross-section ratios are also determined as a function of the J/\u03c8 transverse momentum. The fraction of signal events arising from single and double parton scattering is estimated, and a lower limit of 5.3 (3.7) mb at 68 (95)% confidence level is placed on the effective cross-section regulating double parton interactions. ation of the LHC, as well as the support staff from our institutions without whom ATLAS could not be operated efficiently.

            "text": "In the Standard Model, a single parton-parton interaction can produce a J/\u03c8 meson in association with a Z boson either through a \"prompt\" QCD subprocess, or through the production of a Z boson with a b-quark and its subsequent decay into a J/\u03c8 (\"non-prompt\" production). The same classification into prompt/non-prompt applies to any feed-down into J/\u03c8 production from the decays of excited charmonium states (expected to be approximately 20-30 % of the total inclusive rate), depending on the production mechanism for those states. In addition, this final state may also result from the production of a Z boson and a J/\u03c8 (either promptly e-mail: atlas.publications@cern.ch or non-promptly produced) from two distinct parton-parton interactions within the same proton-proton collision. Previous searches for the related processes W + \u03d2(1S) and Z + \u03d2(1S) by CDF saw no evidence for the associatedproduction of vector-bosons and quarkonia and set limits on the production rate [1,2]. The production of a prompt J/\u03c8 in association with a W boson was observed previously [3] by the ATLAS experiment.",

            "text": "The mechanisms responsible for the production of prompt J/\u03c8, and indeed all quarkonia, are not fully understood in hadron collisions. While the rate of hadroproduction of the J/\u03c8 [4-7] and \u03c8(2S) [7][8][9][10], as a function of their transverse momentum, p T , is now modelled well by predictions in the non-relativistic QCD (NRQCD) [11-13] framework up to transverse momenta of 100 GeV, predictions of related observables such as charmonium spin-alignment [14,15] remain challenging to model simultaneously with the production rate, in part due to the number of free parameters which are not calculable and must be constrained from data. The study of additional observables and new final states provides further constraints on the contributions from coloursinglet [16][17][18][19][20][21][22] and colour-octet production processes, and their properties. The production of a gauge boson in association with a J/\u03c8 sets a high energy scale for the scattering process and results in an improvement in the perturbative convergence of the calculations [23,24] that has troubled the accuracy of quarkonium production models in the past [25]. Recent literature [24] has suggested that colouroctet contributions should dominate the total production rate and that next-to-leading-order (NLO) contributions enhance the cross-section over leading-order (LO) predictions, while other groups [23] state that colour-singlet processes may be important.",

            "text": "Contributions to the total Z + J/\u03c8 production rate can come from non-prompt J/\u03c8 originating from the decay of a b-hadron. Measurement of this contribution provides a new opportunity for studying heavy-flavour production in association with a Z boson [26,27]. Beyond the study of quarkonium production mechanisms, measurement of the Z + prompt J/\u03c8 rate may be relevant for the study of Z Z * production in a kinematic regime complementary to that previously studied at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) [28,29] where one on-shell Z boson is produced along with a highly virtual boson that fragments into a cc pair. Measurement of Z + prompt J/\u03c8 production also represents an important background to the search for the rare Z \u2192 + \u2212 J/\u03c8 threebody decay [30][31][32]. In the future, Z + prompt J/\u03c8 may prove to be a compelling mode for the study of rare decays of the Higgs boson in quarkonia and associated vector-boson decay modes, proposed in Refs. [33,34] and more recently in Refs. [35,36]. Such decays have received renewed attention as a promising mode for the study of Higgs boson charm couplings [37] and its CP properties [38], and also as a possible background to H \u2192 Z Z * decay [39]. The production of a Z boson in association with a J/\u03c8 can also contribute to the search for new physics [35,[40][41][42][43].",

The NLO generator Powheg (r1556) [56][57][58], interfaced to Pythia (8.160) [59], is used to model the signal, as well as Drell-Yan contributions away from the Z peak and Z \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 or W \u2192 \u03bd backgrounds. These samples use the CT10 PDF set [60] and the ATLAS AU2 tune [61]. The LO multi-leg generator Sherpa v1.4.1 [62] is used as an alternative signal model. Top quark processes involving tt or single top production are modelled with the NLO generator MC@NLO (4.03) [63,64], interfaced to Herwig (6.52) [65] for parton showering and Jimmy (4.31) [66] for the underlying-event modelling with the ATLAS AUET2 tune [67] and the CT10 PDFs. The singletop W t process is modelled with the AcerMC (3.8) [68] generator, using the CTEQ6L1 PDF set [69] and interfaced to Pythia (6.42) [70]. Diboson (W Z, W W and Z Z) production is modelled using the Herwig (6.52) and Jimmy generators with the ATLAS AUET2 tune and the CTEQ6L1 PDF set. The detector response is modelled using the ATLAS simulation infrastructure [71] based on the Geant4 toolkit [72]. Background contributions arising from multi-jet events and from misidentified leptons are obtained directly from the data. This is achieved by inverting the isolation requirements on the leptons, providing a multi-jet background template, which can be used for comparison with the Z + J/\u03c8 sample. The total background in the m Z PDG \u00b1 10 GeV window is estimated to be 0.4 \u00b1 0.4 % (including systematic uncertainties), giving a sample of 16.15 million Z boson candidates after background subtraction, of which 8.20 million are observed with Z \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 and 7.95 million with Z \u2192 e + e \u2212 . The di-muon to di-electron ratios of the associated-production Z + J/\u03c8 sample and the inclusive Z sample are compared and found to be consistent within statistical uncertainties (0.92 \u00b1 0.11 and 1.03 \u00b1 0.01, respectively).",

While the most likely scenario is that all but one of these inelastic collisions are lowp T background events, there is a certain probability that two or more of these produce a hard scatter. Of these cases, some produce a Z from one scatter, and a J/\u03c8 from another. To exclude as many as possible of these background events, the two dilepton vertices are required to be separated along the z-axis by less than 10 mm. The remain-ing contamination can be estimated using four ingredients: the spread of the beam spot in z for the data-taking period of relevance; the J/\u03c8 production cross-sections (prompt or non-prompt) from pp collisions at 8 TeV; the number of Z candidates; and the mean number of inelastic interactions per proton-proton bunch crossing, \u03bc . This latter quantity is calculated from the instantaneous luminosity, L, as \u03bc = L\u03c3 inel /n b f r , where \u03c3 inel is the pp inelastic crosssection (equal to 73 mb [74]), n b is the number of colliding bunches and f r is the LHC revolution frequency.",

This model parameterised the mass with a Gaussian function for the J/\u03c8 signal and exponential (or polynomial) functions for the combinatorial background, and parameterised the pseudo-proper time with the sum of a Gaussian and a doublesided exponential function convolved with a Gaussian resolution function for the prompt J/\u03c8 and prompt combinatorial background component, and an exponential function convolved with a Gaussian resolution function for the nonprompt J/\u03c8 and non-prompt combinatorial background.

This assumption neglects the possible difference in kinematics between J/\u03c8 mesons that are produced inclusively and J/\u03c8 mesons produced in association with a Z boson and needs to be taken into account. This effect is evaluated by removing the link between the parameters and repeating the fit, using the main fit model and the alternative considered for the systematic study. The systematic uncertainty associated with the fit procedure was determined with a toy MC simulation technique. A large number of simulated data samples were generated for the two rapidity bins and then fitted with all the available fit procedures. The uncertainties were evaluated from the maximal variation in mean yield extracted from each of the three fit models, relative to the nominal model.

Ratios, corrected for the limited geometrical acceptance for the muons from the J/\u03c8 decay in the J/\u03c8 fiducial volume, are also presented. For prompt production this correction factor depends on the spin-alignment state of J/\u03c8 produced in association with a Z boson, which may differ from the spin-alignment observed in inclusive J/\u03c8 production. The measured Z + prompt J/\u03c8 production rates are compared to theoretical predictions at LO and NLO for colour-singlet and colour-octet prompt production processes. A higher production rate is predicted through colour-octet transitions than through colour-singlet processes, but the expected production rate from the sum of singlet and octet contributions is lower than the data by a factor of 2 to 5 in the p J/\u03c8 T range studied. Measurements of the azimuthal angle between the Z boson and J/\u03c8 meson suggest that both single and double parton scattering contributions may be present in the data. Using the effective cross-section regulating double parton scattering rates as measured by ATLAS in the W + 2-jet final state, the fraction of the inclusive production rate arising from double parton scattering interactions is estimated to be (29 \u00b1 9) % for prompt production and (8 \u00b1 2) % for nonprompt production. An independent limit on the maximum rate of double parton scattering contributing to the signal is set, corresponding to a lower limit on the effective crosssection of 5.3 mb (3.7 mb) at 68 % (95 %) confidence level. The measured production cross-section ratios of inclusive Z + prompt J/\u03c8 and Z + non-prompt J/\u03c8 production, and the estimated contribution from double parton scattering, are shown differentially in five intervals of the J/\u03c8 p T , with the differential production rates compared to NLO predictions from colour-singlet and colour-octet processes.
