DK \u00c30 decays has been reported by LHCb [7]. This decay is particularly sensitive to owing to the interference of b ! c \" us and b ! u \" cs amplitudes, which for this decay are of similar magnitude. It has been noted that an amplitude analysis of B 0 ! DK \u00fe \u00c0 decays can further improve the sensitivity and also resolve the ambiguities in the result [8,9]. The decays B 0 ! \" D 0 K \u00fe \u00c0 and B 0 s ! \" D 0 K \u00c0 \u00fe can be mediated by the decay diagrams shown in Fig. 1. Both B 0 and B 0 s decays are flavor specific, with the charge of the kaon identifying the flavor of the decaying B meson, though the charges are opposite in the two cases. In addition to these color-allowed tree-level diagrams, colorsuppressed tree-level diagrams contribute to B 0 \u00f0s\u00de ! \" D 0 K decays (K denotes the sum over both charge combinations). Both color-allowed and color-suppressed diagrams contribute to the CKM-suppressed B 0 \u00f0s\u00de ! D 0 K modes.

The combined tracking system provides a momentum measurement with relative uncertainty that varies from 0.4% at 5 GeV=c to 0.6% at 100 GeV=c, and impact parameter (IP) resolution of 20 m for tracks with high transverse momentum (p T ). Charged hadrons are identified using two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors [15].

K \u00fe \u00c0 decays to obtain background-subtracted efficiency tables for kaons and pions as a function of their p and p T [15,35]. The kinematic properties of the particles in signal decays are obtained from simulation in which events are uniformly distributed across the phase space, allowing the PID efficiency for each event to be obtained from the tables, while taking into account the correlation between the p and p T values of the two tracks. The other contributions to the efficiency (detector acceptance, selection criteria and trigger effects) are determined from phase space simulation, and validated using data. All are found to be approximately constant across the Dalitz plane, apart from some modulations seen near the kinematic boundaries and, for the DK channels, a variation caused by different PID requirements on the pion and the kaon. The efficiency for each mode, averaged across the Dalitz plot, is given in Table I together with the contributions from geometrical acceptance, trigger and selection requirements and particle identification.",

The TABLE I. Summary of the efficiencies for D and DK in phase space simulation. Contributions from geometrical acceptance ( geom ), trigger and selection requirements ( trig&sel ) and particle identification ( PID ) are shown. The geometrical acceptance is evaluated for B mesons produced within the detector acceptance. Values given are in percent.  variation of efficiency across the Dalitz plot may not be correctly modelled in simulation. A two-dimensional polynomial is used to fit the variation across the Dalitz region of each of the four contributions to the efficiency (detector acceptance, selection criteria, PID and trigger effects). These polynomials are used to generate 1000 simulated pseudoexperiments, varying the fit parameters within their uncertainties. Each set of simulations is used to calculate the efficiency corrected yield. The standard deviation from a Gaussian fit to these yields is used to provide a systematic uncertainty for each decay mode. This leads to a systematic uncertainty of 3.4% (3.1%) for R B 0 (R B 0 s ). The DK fit model is varied by scaling the signal PDF width ratio to account for the different masses of the B 0 and B 0 s mesons, replacing the PDFs of the background components with unsmoothed versions, adding components for potential background from B 0 s ! \" D \u00c30 \" K \u00c30 and \" \u00c3 0 b ! \" D 0 \" p \u00fe decays, and replacing the double Gaussian signal components with double Crystal Ball [37] functions. The D fit model is varied by replacing the PDF of the \" \u00c3 0 b ! \" D 0 \" p \u00fe component with an unsmoothed version, varying the slope of the combinatorial background and replacing the exponential partially reconstructed background component with a PDF for B 0 ! \" D \u00c30 \u00fe \u00c0 decays. Combined in quadrature, these contribute 6.3% (4.3%) to R B 0 (R B 0 s ). Variations in the D \u00c3AE , D AE and D AE s vetoes contribute to R B 0 (R B 0 s ), at the level of <0:1%, 2.0% and 0.2% (1.0%, 0.5% and 0.2%), respectively. In addition, the possible differences in the data to simulation ratios of trigger and PID efficiencies between the two channels (both 1.0%) and the limited statistics of the simulated data samples used to calculate efficiencies (2.0%) affect both R B 0 and R B 0 s . The uncertainty on the quantity f s =f d (7.8%) affects only R B 0 s . The total systematic uncertainties are obtained as the quadratic sums of all contributions.",
