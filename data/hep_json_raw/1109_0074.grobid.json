The far detector was completed in 2010 and data-taking has started in spring 2011. Status of data-taking is presented and some performance plots from physics data are shown in this paper for the first time. Also the prospect of experimental sensitivity is presented, in light of recent indication from T2K for a non-zero \u03b8 13 value.",

Especially, while two other angles are large, the mixing angle \u03b8 13 seems to be small and only an upper limit sin 2 2\u03b8 13 < 0.15 has been set [1]. Measurement of this angle is one the most important tasks of neutrino physics in next few years, as the value of \u03b8 13 determines the detectability of CP violation phase \u03b4 CP in future experiments.",

For \u2206m 2 31 = 2.5 \u00d7 10 \u22123 eV 2 , this corresponds to first oscillation maximum at a few 100 km for accelerator neutrino (E \u2248 1 GeV), while it is 1\u223c2 km for reactor neutrino of E \u2248 4 MeV. (For the same energy, KamLAND explores the sector \u2206m 2 21 = 8 \u00d7 10 \u22125 eV 2 at much larger distances.) Therefore, the principle of reactor \u03b8 13 experiment is to measure the electron anti-neutrino flux precisely at a distance of 1\u223c2 km from the source and detect disappearance (the energy is not enough for appearance of other leptons). Since it is a pure \u03b8 13 measurement, it is complementary to accelerator appearance experiment and both methods are necessary to yield richer physics results. To reduce the uncertainties related to source flux estimation, new-generation reactor experiments (Daya Bay in China, Double Chooz in France and RENO in Korea) have a concept of placing identical detectors at near (before oscillation) and far locations and make a ratio of the two measurements.",

Gd has a very large neutron absorption cross section. The positron deposits its kinetic energy and annihilates in the target, giving rise to a prompt signal. The neutrino energy can be measured from this signal. The neutron drifts in the target and thermalizes, finally absorbed by Gd which emits a few \u03b3 rays with a total energy of 8 MeV. This signal occurs \u223c 30 \u00b5s after the prompt signal on average and is called the delayed signal. Making \"delayed coincidence\" of these two signals is a key to separate a neutrino signal from the large backgrounds from environment and cosmic rays.",

In parallel, installation of Outer Veto (plastic scintillator strips to track cosmic muons) is on-going and its lower part has already been completed. Glove Box for calibration (to deploy radioactive and other sources) has just been installed. For the near detector, civil construction of the tunnel and the lab hall is ongoing, and will be finished in Apr. 2012. The detector construction will then follow, expected to be finished by the end of 2012. After that, the data-taking will be in \"double\" mode with reduced systematic uncertainties.",

It includes calibration runs with light injection by embedded fibers. Trigger rate is about 120 Hz. So far, already 70 days of physics data have been accumulated. Still detailed checks on data are to be made, but preliminary plots from physics runs are shown in the next section.   Figure 2(right) shows the stability of singles rate in delayed energy window (currently 6 to 12 MeV), after vetoing muon-correlated events. The rate is well below 0.01 Hz, which is less than half of the proposal value (0.024 Hz, which was scaled from Chooz experiment). The singles rate in prompt energy window (currently 0.7 to 12 MeV) is 10 Hz, as was expected in the proposal and much lower than previous Chooz experiment (64.8 Hz) thanks to the new Buffer layer. From these observed performances, the accidental coincidence rate is expected to be small enough and a clean set of neutrino candidates is anticipated in the current data. Detailed studies on correlated backgrounds (fast neutrons and long-lived isotopes induced by cosmic rays) will also be made. Figure 3 shows the revised sensitivity of Double Chooz as a function of time, in which the start of near-detector datataking is set to end of 2012. Physics data-taking efficiency of 80% and reactor duty-cycle of 80% are assumed. Both rate and spectral shape information of neutrino events are used in oscillation analysis. For the far-detector only phase, normalization error of 2.5% and bin-to-bin uncorrelated error of 2% are assumed.",
