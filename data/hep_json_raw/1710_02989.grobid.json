The e + e \u2212 \u2192 K + K \u2212 cross section, particularly in the \u03c6 meson energy region, is also required for a precise calculation of the hadronic contribution to the muon anomaly, a \u03bc , and the value of the fine structure constant at the Z boson peak, \u03b1(M Z ) [1]. The most precise cross section measurements performed by the CMD-2 [2] and BaBar [3] experiments have tension at the level of more than 5% (about 2.6 standard deviations) in the \u03c6 meson energy region.",
