            "text": "Abstract Normalised multi-differential cross sections for top quark pair (tt) production are measured in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV using events containing two oppositely charged leptons. The analysed data were recorded with the CMS detector in 2016 and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 . The doubledifferential tt cross section is measured as a function of the kinematic properties of the top quark and of the tt system at parton level in the full phase space. A triple-differential measurement is performed as a function of the invariant mass and rapidity of the tt system and the multiplicity of additional jets at particle level. The data are compared to predictions of Monte Carlo event generators that complement next-to-leading-order (NLO) quantum chromodynamics (QCD) calculations with parton showers. Together with a fixed-order NLO QCD calculation, the triple-differential measurement is used to extract values of the strong coupling strength \u03b1 S and the top quark pole mass (m = 170.5 \u00b1 0.8 GeV are extracted, which account for experimental and theoretical uncertainties, the latter being estimated from NLO scale variations. Possible effects from Coulomb and soft-gluon resummation near the tt production threshold are neglected in these parameter extractions. A rough estimate of these effects indicates an expected correction of m pole t of the order of +1 GeV, which can be regarded as additional theoretical uncertainty in the current m",

            "text": "Measurements of top quark pair (tt) production are important for checking the validity of the standard model (SM) and searching for new phenomena. In particular, the large data set delivered by the CERN LHC allows precise measurements of the tt production cross section as a function of tt kinematic observables. These can be used to check the most recent predictions of perturbative quantum chromodynamics (QCD) and to constrain input parameters, some of which are fundamental to the SM. At the LHC, top quarks are predominantly produced via gluon-gluon fusion. Using measurements of the production cross section in a global fit of parton distribution functions (PDFs) can help determine the gluon distribution at large values of x [1][2][3], where x is the fraction of the proton momentum carried by a parton. Furthermore, measurements of the cross section as a function of the tt invariant mass, from the threshold to the TeV region, provide high sensitivity for constraining the top quark pole mass, m pole t , which is defined as the pole of the top quark propagator (see e.g. Refs. [4][5][6]). At LHC energies, a large fraction of tt events is produced with additional hard jets in the final state. Events containing such additional jets constitute important backgrounds for interesting but rare SM processes such as the associated production of a Higgs boson and tt, as well as for searches for new physics associated with tt production, and must therefore be well understood. Within the SM, processes with extra jets can also be used to constrain the strong coupling strength, \u03b1 S , at the scale of the top quark mass. Furthermore, the production of tt in association with extra jets provides additional sensitivity to m pole t since gluon radiation depends on m pole t through threshold and cone effects [7].",

            "text": "Differential cross sections for tt production have been measured previously in proton-antiproton collisions at the Tevatron at a centre-of-mass energy of 1.96 TeV [8,9] and in proton-proton (pp) collisions at the LHC at \u221a s = 7 TeV [10-14], 8 TeV [14-21], and 13 TeV [22][23][24][25][26][27]. A milestone was reached in three CMS analyses [20,22,23], where the tt production dynamics was probed with double-differential cross sections. The first analysis [20] used data recorded at \u221a s = 8 TeV by the CMS experiment in 2012. Only tt decays where, after the decay of each top quark into a bottom quark and a W boson, both of the W bosons decay leptonically were considered. Specifically, the e \u00b1 \u03bc \u00b1 decay mode (e\u03bc) was selected, requiring two oppositely charged leptons and at least two jets. Our present paper provides a new measurement, following the procedures of Ref. [20]. It is based on data taken by the CMS experiment in 2016 at \u221a s = 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9\u00b10.9 fb \u22121 . In addition to e\u03bc, the decay modes e + e \u2212 (ee) and \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 (\u03bc\u03bc) are also selected, roughly doubling thereby the total number of expected tt signal events. Our latest measurement complements the analyses [22,23], based on data taken at \u221a s = 13 TeV, but using tt decays in the +jets ( = e, \u03bc) final state.",

Within the solenoid volume are a silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL), and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter, each composed of a barrel and two endcap sections. Forward calorimeters extend the \u03b7 coverage provided by the barrel and endcap detectors. Muons are measured in gas-ionisation detectors embedded in the steel flux-return yoke outside the solenoid. Events of interest are selected using a two-tiered trigger system [41]. The first level, composed of custom hardware processors, uses information from the calorimeters and muon detectors to select events at a rate of around 100 kHz within a time interval of less than 4\u03bcs. The second level, known as the high-level trigger (HLT), consists of a farm of processors running a version of the full event reconstruction software optimised for fast processing, and reduces the event rate to around 1 kHz before data storage. A more detailed description of the CMS detector, together with a definition of the coordinate system used and the relevant kinematic variables, can be found in Ref. [42].",

            "text": "Simulations of physics processes are performed with Monte Carlo (MC) event generators and serve three purposes: firstly, to obtain representative SM predictions of tt production cross sections to be compared to the results of this analysis. Secondly, when interfacing generated tt signal events with a detector simulation, to determine corrections for the effects of hadronisation, reconstruction and selection efficiencies, and resolutions that are to be applied to the data. Thirdly, when interfacing generated background processes to the detector simulation, to obtain predictions for the backgrounds. All MC programs used in this analysis perform the event generation in several steps: matrix-element (ME) level, parton showering matched to ME, hadronisation, and underlying event, including multiparton interaction (MPI). The tt signal processes are simulated with ME calculations at NLO in QCD. For all simulations the proton structure is described by the NNPDF 3.0 NLO PDF set with \u03b1 S (m Z ) = 0.118 [43] where m Z = 91 GeV is the Zboson mass [44], and the value of the top quark mass parameter is fixed to m MC t = 172.5 GeV. For the default signal simulation, the powheg (version 2) [36,45,46] generator is taken. The h damp parameter of powheg, which regulates the damping of real emissions in the NLO calculation when matching to the parton shower, is set to h damp = 1.581m MC t [47]. The pythia program (version 8.2) [40] with the CUETP8M2T4 tune [47][48][49] is used to model parton showering, hadronisation and MPIs. An alternative sample is generated using the mg5_amc@nlo (version 2.2.2) [38] generator, including up to two extra partons at the ME level at NLO. In this setup, referred to as mg5_amc@nlo + pythia, MadSpin [50] is used to model the decays of the top quarks while preserving their spin correlation. The events are matched to pythia using the FxFx prescription [51]. A second alternative sample is generated with powheg and interfaced with herwig++ (version 2.7.1) [52] using the EE5C tune [53].",

Other backgrounds are negligible. For all background samples, the NNPDF3.0 [43] PDF set is used and parton showering, hadronisation, and MPIs are simulated with pythia. Single top quark production is simulated with powheg (version 1) [37,54] using the CUETP8M2T4 tune in pythia with the h damp parameter set to 172.5 GeV in powheg. The Z+jets process is simulated at NLO using mg5_amc@nlo with up to two additional partons at ME level and matched to pythia using the FxFx prescription. The W+jets process is simulated at leading order (LO) using mg5_amc@nlo with up to four additional partons at ME level and matched to pythia using the MLM prescription [55]. Diboson events are simulated with pythia. Predictions are normalised based on their theoretical cross sections and the integrated luminosity of the data sample. The cross sections are calculated to approximate next-to-NLO (NNLO) for single top quark in the tW channel [56], NNLO for Z+jets and W+jets [57], and NLO for diboson production [58]. The tt simulation is normalised to a cross section of 832 +20 \u221229 (scale)\u00b135(PDF+\u03b1 S ) pb calculated with the Top++ (version 2.0) program [59] at NNLO including resummation of next-to-next-to-leading-logarithm (NNLL) soft-gluon terms assuming m pole t = 172.5 GeV and the proton structure described by the CT14 NNLO PDF set [60].",

The three-momenta of the neutrino (\u03bd) and of the antineutrino (\u03bd) are not directly measured, but they can be reconstructed by imposing the following six kinematic constraints: the conservation in the event of the total transverse momentum vector, and the masses of the W bosons, top quark, and top antiquark. The reconstructed top quark and antiquark masses are required to be 172.5 GeV. The p miss T in the event is assumed to originate solely from the two neutrinos in the top quark and antiquark decay chains. To resolve the ambiguity due to multiple algebraic solutions of the equations for the neutrino momenta, the solution with the smallest invariant mass of the tt system is taken. The reconstruction is performed 100 times, each time randomly smearing the measured energies and directions of the reconstructed leptons and jets within their resolution. This smearing procedure recovers certain events that initially yield no solution because of measurement uncertainties. The three-momenta of the two neutrinos are determined as a weighted average over all smeared solutions. For each solution, the weight is calculated based on the expected true spectrum of the invariant mass of a lepton and a b jet stemming from the decay of a top quark and taking the product of the two weights for the top quark and antiquark decay chains. All possible lepton-jet combinations in the event that satisfy the requirement on the invariant mass of the lepton and jet M b < 180 GeV are considered. Combinations are ranked based on the presence of b-tagged jets in the assignments, i.e. a combination with both leptons assigned to b-tagged jets is preferred over those with one or no b-tagged jet. Among assignments with equal number of b-tagged jets, the one with the highest sum of weights is chosen. Events with no solution after smearing are discarded. The efficiency of the kinematic reconstruction, defined as the number of events where a solution is found divided by the total number of selected tt events, is studied in data and simulation and consistent results are observed. The efficiency is about 90% for signal events. After applying the full event selection and the kinematic reconstruction of the tt system, 150,410 events are observed in the e \u00b1 \u03bc \u00b1 channel, 34,890 events in the e + e \u2212 channel, and 70,346 events in the \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 channel. Combining all decay channels, the estimated signal fraction in data is 80.6%. Figure 1 shows the distributions of the reconstructed top quark and tt kinematic variables and of the multiplicity of additional jets in the events. In general, the data are reasonably well described by the simulation, however some trends are visible, in particular for p T (t), where the simulation predicts a somewhat harder spectrum than that observed in data, as reported in previous differential tt cross section measurements [15,18,20,22,23,26,27].",

Since one of the objectives of this analysis is to extract the top quark mass from the differential tt measurements, exploiting the M(tt) distribution in particular, an alternative algorithm is employed, which reconstructs the tt kinematic variables without using the top quark mass constraint. This algorithm is referred to as the \"loose kinematic reconstruction\". In this algorithm, the \u03bd\u03bd system is reconstructed rather than the \u03bd and\u03bd separately. Consequently, it can only be used to reconstruct the total tt system but not the top quark and antiquark separately. As in the full kinematic reconstruction, all possible lepton-jet combinations in the event that satisfy the requirement on the invariant mass of the lepton and jet M b < 180 GeV are considered. Combinations are ranked based on the presence of b-tagged jets in the assignments, but among combinations with equal number of b-tagged jets, the ones with the highestp T jets are chosen. The kinematic variables of the \u03bd\u03bd system are derived as follows: its p T is set equal to p miss T , while its unknown longitudinal momentum and energy are set equal to the longitudinal momentum and energy of the lepton pair. Additional constraints are applied on the invariant mass of the neutrino pair, M(\u03bd\u03bd) \u2265 0, and on the invariant mass of the W bosons, M(W + W \u2212 ) \u2265 2M W , which have only minor effects on the performance of the reconstruction. The method yields similar tt kinematic resolutions and reconstruction efficiency as for the full kinematic reconstruction. In this analysis, the loose kinematic reconstruction is exclusively used to measure triple-differential cross sections as a function of M(tt), y(tt), and extra jet multiplicity, which are exploited to determine QCD parameters, as well as the distributions used to cross-check the results. Figure 2 shows the distributions of the reconstructed tt invariant mass and rapidity using the loose kinematic reconstruction. These distributions are similar to the ones obtained using the full kinematic reconstruction (as shown in Fig. 1). Towards forward rapidities |y(tt)| \u2265 1.5 a trend is visible in which the MC simulations predict more events than observed in the data. However, the differences between simulations and data are still compatible within the estimated shape uncertainties in the signal and backgrounds.",

These events arise from the same tt production process as the signal and thus the normalisation of this background is fixed to that of the signal.

The lower panel in each plot shows the ratio of the observed data event yields to those expected in the simulation matrix specifies the probability for an event originating from one bin of the true distribution to be observed in a specific bin of the reconstructed observables. The response matrix includes the effects of acceptance, detector efficiencies, and resolutions. The response matrix is defined such that the true level corresponds to the full phase space (with no kinematic restrictions) for tt production at parton level. At the detector level, the number of bins used is typically a few times larger than the number of bins used at generator level. The response matrix is taken from the signal simulation. The generalised inverse of the response matrix is used to obtain the distribution of unfolded event numbers from the measured distribution by applying a \u03c7 2 minimisation technique. An additional \u03c7 2 term is included representing Tikhonov regularisation [71]. The regularisation reduces the effect of the statistical fluctuations present in the measured distribution on the high-frequency content of the unfolded spectrum. The regularisation strength is chosen such that the global correlation coefficient is minimal [72]. For the measurements presented here, this choice results in a small contribution from the regularisation term to the total \u03c7 2 , on the order of a few percent. The unfolding of multidimensional distributions is performed by internally mapping the multi-dimensional arrays to one-dimensional arrays [70].",

The bin widths are chosen based on the resolutions of the kinematic variables, such that the purity and the stability of each bin is generally above 20%. For a given bin, the purity is defined as the fraction of events in the tt signal simulation that are generated and reconstructed in the same bin with respect to the total number of events reconstructed in that bin. To evaluate the stability, the number of events in the tt signal simulation that are generated and reconstructed in a given bin are divided by the total number of reconstructed events generated in the bin. The cross section determination based on the signal extraction and unfolding described in Sect. 5 has been validated with closure tests. Large numbers of pseudo-data sets were generated from the tt signal MC simulations and analysed as if they were real data. The normalised differential cross sections are found to be unbiased and the confidence intervals based on the nominal measurements and the estimated \u00b11\u03c3 uncertainties provide correct coverage probability. Any residual non-closure between generated and measured cross sections is found to be small compared to the statistical uncertainties of the measurements and is therefore neglected. A further closure test has been performed by unfolding pseudo-data sets generated using reweighted signal MCs for the detector corrections. The reweighting is performed as a function of the differential cross section kinematic observables and is used to introduce controlled shape variations, e.g. making the p T (t) spectrum harder or softer. This test is sensitive to the stability of the unfolding with respect to the underlying physics model in the simulation. The effect on the unfolded cross sections is negligible for reweightings that lead to shape changes that are comparable to the observed differences between data and nominal MC distributions.",

The uncertainties from the modelling of lepton identification and isolation efficiencies are determined using the \"tag-and-probe\" method with Z+jets event samples [73,74]. The differences of these efficiencies between data and simulation in bins of \u03b7 and p T are generally less than 10% for electrons, and negligible for muons. The uncertainty is estimated by varying the corresponding scale factors in the simulation within their uncertainties. An implicit assumption made in the analysis is that the scale factors derived from the Z+jets sample are applicable for the tt samples, where the efficiency for lepton isolation is reduced due to the typically larger number of jets present in the events. An additional uncertainty of 1% is added to take into account a possible violation of this assumption. This uncertainty is verified with studies with tt enriched samples using a similar event selection as for the present analysis.

An uncertainty from the semileptonic branching ratios of b hadrons is estimated by varying them according to the world average uncertainties [44]. As tt events producing electrons or muons originating from the decay of \u03c4 leptons are considered to be background, the measured differential cross sections are sensitive to the branching ratios of \u03c4 leptons decaying into electrons or muons assumed in the simulation. Hence, an uncertainty is determined by varying the branching ratios by 1.5% [44] in the simulation.",

            "text": "In the case of the [N 0,1+ jet , M(tt), y(tt)] measurement, cross sections for inclusive tt and tt + 1 jet production in each bin of M(tt) and y(tt) are obtained in the following way. The cross sections for inclusive tt + 1 jet production are taken from the N jet \u2265 1 bins of the [N 0,1+ jet , M(tt), y(tt)] measurements. The cross sections for inclusive tt production are calculated from the sum of the cross sections in the N jet = 0 and N jet \u2265 1 bins. Statistical and systematic uncertainties and all correlations are obtained using error propagation. Finally, the cross sections obtained for inclusive tt and tt + 1 jet production are compared to the NLO O(\u03b1 3 S ) and NLO O(\u03b1 4 S ) calculations, respectively. For these processes, the ratios of NLO over LO predictions are about 1.5 on average, and the requirement p T > 30 GeV for the jets ensures that logarithms of the ratio p T /m jet , M(tt), y(tt)] measurements, one with N jet = 0 and another with N jet \u2265 1. The measured cross sections for N jet \u2265 1 are compared to the NLO calculation for inclusive tt+1 jet production, while those for N jet = 0 are compared to the difference of the NLO calculations for inclusive tt and inclusive tt + 1 jet production. The normalisation cross section is evaluated by integrating the differential cross sections over all bins, i.e. it is given by the inclusive tt cross section. As discussed below, \u03c7 2 values are calculated for the comparisons of data and NLO predictions and are also used for the extraction of parameter values. The total \u03c7 The NLO predictions are obtained using the mg5_amc@nlo framework running in the fixed-order mode. A number of the latest proton NLO PDF sets are used, namely: ABMP16 [87], CJ15 [88], CT14 [60], HERA-PDF2.0 [89], JR14 [90], MMHT2014 [91], and NNPDF3.1 [92], available via the lhapdf interface (version 6.1.5) [93]. No tt data were used in the determination of the CJ15, CT14, HERAPDF2.0 and JR14 PDF sets; only total tt production cross section measurements were used to determine the ABMP16 and MMHT2014 PDFs, and both total and differential (from LHC Run 1) tt cross sections were used in the NNPDF3.1 extraction. The number of active flavours is set to n f = 5, an m pole t = 172.5 GeV is used, and \u03b1 S is set to the value used for the corresponding PDF extraction. The renormalisation and factorisation scales are chosen to be \u03bc r = \u03bc f = H /2, H = i m t,i . Here the sum is running over all final-state partons (t, t, and up to three light partons in the tt + 2 jet calculations) and m t denotes a transverse mass, defined as m t = \u221a m 2 + p 2 T . The theoretical uncertainty is estimated by varying \u03bc r and \u03bc f independently up and down by a factor of 2, with the additional restriction that the ratio \u03bc r /\u03bc f stays between 0.5 and 2 [94]. Additionally, an alternative scale choice \u03bc r = \u03bc f = H/2, H = i m t,i , with the sum running only over t and t [86], is considered. The scales are varied coherently in the predictions with different N jet . The final uncertainty is determined as an envelope of all scale variations on the normalised cross sections. This uncertainty is referred to hereafter as a scale uncertainty and is supposed to estimate the impact of missing higherorder terms. The PDF uncertainties are taken into account in the theoretical predictions for each PDF set. The PDF uncertainties of CJ15 [88] and CT14 [60], evaluated at 90% confidence level (CL ), are rescaled to the 68% CL for consistency with other PDF sets. The uncertainties in the normalised tt cross sections originating from \u03b1 S and m by \u00b1 0.005 and \u00b1 5.0 GeV, respectively, are shown). To compare the measured cross sections to the NLO QCD calculations, the latter are further corrected from parton to particle level. The NLO QCD calculations are provided for parton-level jets and stable top quarks, therefore the corrections (further referred to as NP) are determined using additional powheg + pythia MC simulations for tt production with and without MPI, hadronisation and top quark decays, and defined as:  variations are not included in this \u03c7 2 calculation. Sizeable differences of the \u03c7 2 values are observed for the predictions obtained using different PDFs. These differences can be attributed to the different input data and methodologies that were used to extract these sets of PDFs as discussed elsewhere [95,96]. Among the PDF sets considered, the best description of the data is provided by the ABMP16 PDFs. This comparison also shows that the data prefer lower \u03b1 S (m Z ) and m from inclusive tt cross sections at NNLO+NNLL and differential distributions at NLO, and dominated by the inclusive cross section measurement and a measurement from leptonic distributions. For the combination, correlations were not taken into account.

For each theoretical prediction, values of \u03c7 2 and dof for the comparison to the data are reported Near the mass threshold, relevant for the m pole t extraction, the fixed-order perturbation series should be improved with Coloumb and soft-gluon resummation that, however, is not available in the tools used to obtain theoretical predictions in this work. In Ref. [98] these effects are found to be relevant only very close to the threshold (within a few GeV) and give a correction of about +1% to the total tt cross section. A more recent study for the total cross section shows that these corrections are presently known only with a large relative uncertainty [99]. Attributing a +1% total cross section correction to our first M(tt) interval and assuming it to be independent of |y(tt)| and N jet leads to an increase of the predicted cross section in each of the lowest M(tt) bins by 5%.

Moreover, electroweak corrections can be significant in some regions of phase space [100,101], but for the analysis in this paper no electroweak corrections were applied.

The largest sensitivity to \u03b1 S is observed when using the |y(tt)| cross sections; the value for \u03b1 S is, however, strongly dependent on the PDF set used. The N jet distribution provides a smaller \u03b1 S sensitivity, but with little dependence on the PDFs. For m pole t , the largest sensitivity is observed when using the M(tt) cross sections. In fact, almost no sensitivity to m values are consistent with the nominal ones obtained using two N jet bins and have similar precision with a slightly different uncertainty composition: smaller data uncertainties but larger scale uncertainties are present when using three N jet bins. The different uncertainties are expected since more N jet bins provide more sensitivity to \u03b1 S , while the NLO theoretical prediction for the last N jet bins (two or more extra jets) have larger scale uncertainties compared to the other bins (as shown in Fig. 13). This shows that NLO QCD predictions are able to describe tt data with up to two hard extra jets, however higher-order calculations are desirable to match the experimental precision in order to achieve a most accurate \u03b1 S and m values are obtained, but with substantially larger experimental and scale uncertainties due to the increased scale dependence of the NLO predictions for the unnormalised cross sections and uncancelled normalisation uncertainties in the measured cross sections.",

The xFitter program (version 2.0.0) [102], an open-source QCD fit framework for PDF determination, is used. The precise HERA DIS data, obtained from the combination of individual H1 and ZEUS results, are directly sensitive to the valence and sea quark distributions and probe the gluon distribution through scaling violations. Therefore, these data form the core of all PDF fits. The measured tt cross sections are included in the fit to constrain \u03b1 S , m pole t , and the gluon distribution at high values of x, where x is the fraction of the proton momentum carried by a parton.

This value is consistent with the determination of the strangeness fraction when using the CMS measurements of W+c production [117]. The D and E parameters are added for some distributions in order to provide a more flexible functional form. The parameters in Eq. 7are selected by first fitting with all D and E parameters set to zero, and then including them independently one at a time in the fit. The improvement in the \u03c7 2 of the fit is monitored and the procedure is stopped when no further improvement is observed. This leads to a 15-parameter fit. The \u03c7 2 definition used for the HERA DIS data follows that of Eq. (32) in Ref. [89]. It includes an additional logarithmic term that is relevant when the estimated statistical and uncorrelated systematic uncertainties in the data are rescaled during the fit [118]. For the tt data presented here, a \u03c7 2 definition without such a logarithmic term is employed. The treatment of the experimental uncertainties in the tt double-differential cross section measurements follows the prescription given in Sect. 8. The correlated systematic uncertainties are treated through nuisance parameters. For each nuisance parameter a Gaussian probability density function is assumed and a corresponding penalty term is added to the \u03c7 2 . The treatment of the experimental uncertainties for the HERA DIS data follows the prescription given in Ref. [89].",

Fit uncertainties are determined using the criterion of \u0394\u03c7 2 = 1. Model uncertainties arise from the variations in the values assumed for the c quark mass parameter of 1.41 \u2264 M c \u2264 1.53 GeV, the strangeness fraction 0.3 \u2264 f s \u2264 0.5, and the value of Q 2 min imposed on the HERA data. The latter is varied within 2.5 \u2264 Q 2 min \u2264 5.0 GeV 2 , following Ref. [89]. The parametrisation uncertainty is estimated by varying the functional form in Eq. 7of all parton distributions, with D and E parameters added or removed one at a time. Additional parametrisation uncertainties are considered by using two other functional forms in Eq. 7: with A g = 0 and E g = 0, since the \u03c7 2 in these variants of the fit are only a few units worse than that with the nominal parametrisation. Furthermore, \u03bc 2 f0 is changed from 1.9 to 1.6 and 2.2 GeV 2 . The parametrisation uncertainty is constructed as an envelope, built from the maximal differences between the PDFs or QCD parameters resulting from the central fit and all parametrisation variations. For the PDFs, this uncertainty is valid in the x range covered by the PDF fit to the data. The total uncertainty is obtained by adding the fit, model, and parametrisation uncertainties in quadrature. For \u03b1 S and m pole t extraction, the scale uncertainties in the theoretical predictions for tt production are also considered.",

A reduction of uncertainties is observed for the gluon distribution, especially at x \u223c 0.1 where the included tt data are expected to provide constraints, while the improvement at x 0.1 originates mainly from the reduced correlation between \u03b1 S (m Z ) and the gluon PDF. A smaller uncertainty reduction is observed for other PDFs as well (valence and sea quark distributions), because of the correlations between the PDF distributions in the fit, as explained above. In addition to the fit uncertainty reduction, the tt data constrain the large asymmetric model uncertainty of the gluon PDF at high x. This uncertainty originates from the variation of Q 2 min in the fit, using the HERA DIS data only, because of a lack of direct constraints from these data. The relative total PDF uncertainties in the fit using the HERA DIS data only, and the HERA DIS and tt data and their fitted values depend only weakly on each other. This makes future PDF fits at NNLO, once corresponding theoretical predictions for inclusive tt production with additional jets become available, very interesting.",

The analysed data were recorded in 2016 with the CMS detector at the LHC, and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 . The normalised tt cross section is measured in the full phase space as a function of different pairs of kinematic variables that describe either the top quark or the tt system. None of the central predictions of the tested Monte Carlo models is able to correctly describe all the distributions. The data exhibit softer transverse momentum p T (t) distributions than given by the theoretical predictions, as was reported in previous single-differential and doubledifferential tt cross section measurements. The effect of the softer p T (t) spectra in the data relative to the predictions is enhanced at larger values of the invariant mass of the tt system. The predicted p T (t) slopes are strongly sensitive to the parton distribution functions (PDFs) and the top quark pole mass m pole t value used in the calculations, and the description of the data can be improved by changing these parameters.",

When . The highest sensitivity comes from the region of low tt masses. Threshold corrections from Coulomb and soft-gluon resummation are expected to affect this region. In Ref.

A more recent study for the total cross section shows that these corrections are presently known only with a large relative uncertainty [99].

Because the final state of the NLO calculation for tt and at least one jet consists of at most two light partons, there can be up to two jets built from these partons, which balance the tt transverse momentum. Therefore e.g. for p T (tt) > 100 GeV there is at least one jet with p T > 50 GeV in the NLO calculation, and one can use the tt + 1 jet calculation requiring p T (tt) > 100 GeV without any requirement on the extra jet (if the jet p T threshold is not larger than 50 GeV). In this analysis, the jet p T > 30 GeV was found to correspond approximately to p T (tt) 50 GeV, therefore the boundary of 50 GeV was chosen to split the data into two p T (tt) bins. The minimum jet p T of 25 GeV was used in the NLO calculation for tt + 1 jet production (no selection on jet |\u03b7|), and the predicted events were required to have p T (tt) > 50 GeV. This calculation was used for the bin with p T (tt) > 50 GeV, while for the bin with p T (tt) < 50 GeV the difference of the predictions for inclusive tt production and tt + 1 jet production was used. The extracted values of \u03b1 S (m Z ) and m pole t are shown in Fig. 29. They are consistent with the nominal ones (shown in Fig. 18) but have slightly larger uncertainties.  ",

In this analysis the PDFs, \u03b1 S (m Z ), and m pole t are extracted from the [N 0,1+ jet , M(tt), y(tt)] cross sections. These results are considered to be the nominal ones and are checked by repeating the analysis using the [N 0,1,2+ jet , M(tt), y(tt)] cross sections. In Figs. 14, 15 and 16 the [N 0,1+ jet , M(tt), y(tt)] cross sections are compared to the predictions obtained using different PDFs, \u03b1 S (m Z ), and m pole t values. For each comparison, a \u03c7 2 is calculated, taking into account the uncertainties of the data but ignoring uncertainties of the predictions. For the comparison in Fig. 14, additional \u03c7 2 values are determined, taking also PDF uncertainties in the predictions into account, i.e. Eq. (3) becomes Cov = Cov unf + Cov syst + Cov PDF , where Cov PDF is a covariance matrix that accounts for the PDF uncertainties. Theoretical uncertainties from scale, \u03b1 S (m Z ), and m pole t",

The largest sensitivity to m pole t is observed in the lowest M(tt) region close to the threshold, while the sensitivity in the other M(tt) bins occurs mainly because of the cross section normalisation. The values of \u03b1 S (m Z ) and m pole t are extracted by calculating a \u03c7 2 between data and NLO predictions as a function of the input \u03b1 S (m Z ) or m pole t value, and approximating the dependence with a parabola. The minimum of the parabola is taken as the extracted \u03b1 S (m Z ) or m pole t value, while its uncertainty is estimated from the \u0394\u03c7 2 = 1 variation. This extraction is performed separately using different PDF sets, as well as different scale values. As for the additional \u03c7 2 values in Fig. 14, the PDF uncertainties in the predictions are taken into account in these \u03c7 2 calculations. Among the available PDF sets, only CT14, HERAPDF2.0, and ABMP16 provide PDF sets for enough different \u03b1 S (m Z ) values and are suitable for \u03b1 S (m Z ) extraction. Because the dependence of the measured [N 0,1+ jet , M(tt), y(tt)] cross sections on the m MC t value (as well as on PDFs and \u03b1 S ) is much smaller than the sensitivity of the theoretical predictions to m pole t (more details are given in Appendix C), it is not taken into account in the extraction procedure. The \u03b1 S (m Z ) and m pole t scans for different PDF sets are shown in Fig. 17. The extracted \u03b1 S (m Z ) and m pole t values are reported in the plots. Furthermore, the \u03b1 S (m Z ) (m pole t ) scans were performed using altered scale and m pole t (\u03b1 S (m Z )) settings and different PDF sets. For all input PDF sets, the impact of the scale variations is moderate and a weak positive correlation (\u223c30%) between \u03b1 S (m Z ) and m pole t is observed (the distributions are shown in Figs. 25 and 26 in Appendix B). The values of \u03b1 S (m Z ) and m pole t , extracted at NLO, are compared in Fig. 18 to the world average [97] and reported in Tables 2 and 3. The contributions to the total uncertainty arising from the data and from the theoretical prediction due to PDF, scale, and m pole t or \u03b1 S (m Z ) uncertainties are shown separately. For the extraction of \u03b1 S (m Z ), the experimental, PDF, scale, and m pole t uncertainties are comparable in magnitude. The size of the PDF uncertainties varies significantly for different PDF sets, and the extracted \u03b1 S (m Z ) values depend on the input PDFs because of a strong correlation between \u03b1 S and the gluon distribution. This illustrates that precise and reliable \u03b1 S (m Z ) extractions from the observed data can be obtained only in a simultaneous PDF and \u03b1 S (m Z ) fit. For the m pole t extraction, the total uncertainty is dominated by the data uncertainties. The world average [97] is computed based on extractions of m pole t",
