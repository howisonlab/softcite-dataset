The total accumulated data has been of more of 1 ab \u22121 for Belle and about 550 f b \u22121 for BaBar.

The table at the bottom of the picture presents the number of millions of events collected at the three resonances used in the searches reviewed in this paper.

Both the resonant twobody decay \u03a5(1s) \u2192 \u03b3A 0 and the non-resonant three-body decay \u03a5(1s) \u2192 \u03b3\u03c7\u03c7 are analyzed. Two pions of opposite charge and a single energetic photon with E * \u03b3 \u2264 0.15 GeV plus a large amount of missing energy and momentum are required in the event. Sources of background as the \u03a5(1s) \u2192 \u03b3K L K L and \u03a5(1s) \u2192 \u03b3nn are reduced by using a hadron calorimeter (IFR) based veto. The signal yield is extracted as a function of m A 0 (m \u03c7 ) in the interval 0 \u2264 m A 0 \u2264 9.2 GeV (0 \u2264 m \u03c7 \u2264 4.5 GeV), using two kinematic variables: the di-pion recoil mass M rec and the missing mass squared M 2 X . No significant excess of events above the background is observed and upper limits are set at 90% confidence level on B(\u03a5(1s) \u2192 \u03b3A 0 (invisible) < (1.9 \u00f7 37)10 \u22126 and B(\u03a5(1s) \u2192 \u03b3\u03c7\u03c7) < (0.5 \u00f7 24)10 \u22125 (Fig.5).  BaBar also searched for a Dark Matter candidate in the direct decay of \u03a5(1s) to invisible states [12]. Also in this case, the \u03a5(1s) is tagged with the help of the di-pion system in the \u03a5(3s) \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03a5(1s) transition. Two oppositely charged pions with no other detector activity in the event are required. The mass of the recoil system is reconstructed. In addition to the combinatoric events, there are other important sources of peaking background. In particular the \u03a5(3s) \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03a5(1s) decay, where the \u03a5(1s) final state particles (mainly lepton pairs, low energy particles or other non-interacting neutral hadrons) are undetected. The contribution from these peaking sources is estimated from simulation and validated on data in a control sample with sim-ilar requirements as the signal sample. After the combinatoric background subtraction, a still significant signal eccess of 2326 \u00b1 105 events is observed (see Fig.6). At the same time the peaking background expected contribution is determined to be of 2444 \u00b1 123 events, which is fully consistent with the excess found. After total background subtraction a signal yield consistent with zero (\u2212118 \u00b1 105 \u00b1 24) is found in the expected region and an upper limit of B(\u03a5(1s) \u2192invisible) < 3.0 \u00d7 10 \u22124 at the 90% confidence level is obtained.",
