The tt cross-section has been measured at ATLAS and CMS using several final states and at various centre-of-mass energies [3][4][5].

The detector includes a high-precision tracking system consisting of a silicon-strip vertex detector surrounding the pp interaction region, a silicon-strip detector located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4 Tm, and three stations of silicon-strip detectors and straw drift tubes placed downstream of the magnet. The tracking system provides a measurement of momentum, p, of charged particles with a relative uncertainty that varies from 0.5% at low momentum to 1.0% at 200 GeV. 1 The minimum distance of a track to a primary vertex (PV), the impact parameter (IP), is measured with a resolution of (15 + 29/p T ) \u03bcm, where p T is the component of the momentum transverse to the beam, in GeV. Different types of charged hadrons are distinguished using information from two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors. Photons, electrons and hadrons are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad (SPD) and preshower (PRS) detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter and a hadronic calorimeter. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers. The online event selection is performed by a trigger, which consists of a hardware stage, based on information from the calorimeter and muon systems, followed by a software stage, which applies a full event reconstruction.",

Event samples of W + bb, W + cc, Z + bb and Z + cc production are generated with Alpgen [19], which includes tree-level contributions with up to four additional emissions of final state partons with respect to the leading-order diagram. Pythia 8 is used to perform the hadronisation for these samples. The cross-sections of the simulated processes are calculated at next-to-leading-order (NLO) including spin correlation effects with MCFM [20] using the CT10 PDF set [21]. Decays of hadronic particles are described by EvtGen [22], in which final-state radiation is generated using Photos [23]. The interaction of the generated particles with the detector, and its response, are implemented using the Geant4 toolkit [24] as described in Ref. [25]. Since neither showering nor hadronisation are included in MCFM, an overall correction is calculated to compare the measurements with the predicted cross-section at particlelevel. This is done by generating W + bb, W + cc and tt events with Pythia 8 with the CT10 PDF set [21] where the same acceptance requirements are applied. The particle-level lepton momentum used here is the momentum after final-state radiation as implemented in Pythia 8.",

Jets are reconstructed using a particle flow algorithm [28] and clustered using the anti-k T algorithm [29] with distance parameter R = 0.5 as implemented in the FastJet software package [30]. As in Ref. [28], the jet energy is corrected to the particle level, excluding neutrinos, and the same jet quality requirements are applied. Jets are heavy-flavour tagged, i.e. as originating from a b or c quark, by the presence of a secondary vertex (SV) with R < 0.5 between the jet axis and the direction of flight of the heavy-flavour hadron candidate, defined by the vector from the PV to the SV position.",

The PDF uncertainty is evaluated following the procedure of Ref. [37]. The influence of the uncertainty on the strong coupling constant is evaluated by calculating the cross-sections with PDF sets [21] using values of \u03b1 s (M Z ): 0.117, 0.118 and 0.119. The scale uncertainty is evaluated by calculat-ing the cross-sections varying the renormalisation and factorisation scale by a factor of two. The total uncertainty is taken as (\u03b4 2 PDF + \u03b4 2 \u03b1s ) + \u03b4 scale as done in Ref. [6] which translates to relative uncertainties on the signal yields in the range 3-10%. These theoretical uncertainties are also considered in the signal yields in the experimental acceptance. The systematic uncertainties in the normalisations due to the limited size of the simulated samples are between 1 and 7%. The uncertainty on the normalisation of the QCD multi-jet background, taken from data, is found to have a negligible effect.",
