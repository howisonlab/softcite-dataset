            "text": "The Precision IceCube Next Generation Upgrade (PINGU) is a proposed low-energy infill extension to the IceCube Neutrino Observatory. With detection technology modeled closely on the successful IceCube example, PINGU will provide a 6 Mton effective mass for neutrino detection with an energy threshold of a few GeV. With an unprecedented sample of over 60,000 atmospheric neutrinos per year in this energy range, PINGU will make highly competitive measurements of neutrino oscillation parameters in an energy range over an order of magnitude higher than long-baseline neutrino beam experiments. PINGU will measure the mixing parameters \u03b8 23 and \u2206m 2 32 , including the octant of \u03b8 23 for a wide range of values, and determine the neutrino mass ordering at 3\u03c3 median significance within 5 years of operation. PINGU's high precision measurement of the rate of \u03bd \u03c4 appearance will provide essential tests of the unitarity of the 3 \u00d7 3 PMNS neutrino mixing matrix. PINGU will also improve the sensitivity of searches for low mass dark matter in the Sun, use neutrino tomography to directly probe the composition of the Earth's core, and improve IceCube's sensitivity to neutrinos from Galactic supernovae. Reoptimization of the PINGU design has permitted substantial reduction in both cost and logistical requirements while delivering performance nearly identical to configurations previously studied.",

Several important questions remain: whether the mixing angle \u03b8 23 is maximal and, if not, whether \u03b8 23 < 45 \u2022 or \u03b8 23 > 45 \u2022 (the \"octant\" of \u03b8 23 ), whether the ordering of the mass eigenstates is \"normal\" or \"inverted\", and whether Charge-Parity (CP) symmetry is violated with nonzero \u03b4 CP in the lepton sector. More fundamentally, a better understanding of neutrino oscillations may shed light on the origins of neutrino mass, the possible relationship of neutrinos to the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the universe, and probe new physics beyond the Standard Model.",

Those projections were based on a configuration of 40 new strings, each mounting 96 optical modules. Our recent studies have shown that a geometry that concentrates a slightly larger amount of PMT photocathode area on fewer strings provides the same sensitivity while reducing both costs and logistical support requirements significantly. A schematic of this design is shown in Fig. 2. Based on our experience with IceCube, in which 18-20 strings were deployed per season once construction was underway, 26 strings of 192 optical modules each could be installed at the South Pole in two deployment seasons. This configuration would provide nearly identical performance to the original 40-string design. Even a reduced 20 string geometry, which could be deployed in two seasons with considerable schedule contingency, would still enable the essential scientific program, even though it would provide less precise event reconstruction and reduced performance compared to the projections presented here.",

We are also evaluating the possibility of replacing the optical modules with multi-PMT mDOMs [11,12].

They are based on full Monte Carlo simulations and detailed reconstructions, including the full detector model developed over 10 years of experience operating the IceCube detector. The full suite of systematic uncertainties used for IceCube data analysis have been taken into account in these studies.  The diagonal lines indicate the characteristic oscillation scales L set by the solar mass-squared splitting \u2206m 2 21 (dashed) and L atm set by the atmospheric mass-squared splitting \u2206m 2 32 (dot-dashed). The 3.5 GeV threshold for \u03c4 lepton production in \u03bd \u03c4 CC events is shown by a vertical line. The energy ranges covered by the KM3NeT ORCA and ARCA detectors are indicated by bars above the plot for clarity. For Super-Kamiokande, ORCA, and PINGU, the upper end of the energy range is that at which the \u03bd \u00b5 energy resolution degrades because muons are no longer contained within the detector. For IceCube and PINGU, this energy is marked by the vertical dashed line.

Its measurement would assist in discriminating between certain theoretical models at the GUT mass scale [34]. Experimentally, knowledge of the ordering would positively impact ongoing and future research of other crucial neutrino properties: the unknown NMO is a major ambiguity for running or approved accelerator neutrino oscillation experiments with sensitivity to leptonic CP violation [35,36,37,38]   completely free nuisance parameter in the analysis, \u03b4 CP reduces the significance of the ordering determination by 10%-20% at most, depending on the true values of \u03b4 CP and \u03b8 23 . In addition, atmospheric neutrino data from PINGU or other proposed experiments such as INO [39] or ORCA [40] in combination with existing neutrino beam experiments and proposed reactor experiments like JUNO [41] and RENO-50 [42] provide synergistic inputs that can improve the combined significance of the NMO determination beyond the purely statistical addition of results [43,44,45]. PINGU's determination of the NMO is thus highly complementary to other experimental efforts, resolving possible degeneracies between the mass ordering and CP violation and possibly increasing the precision with which CP violation can be measured by long-baseline experiments. In addition, the determination of the NMO will influence the planning and interpretation of non-oscillation experiments (neutrinoless double \u03b2 decay and \u03b2 decay) sensitive to the particle nature of the neutrino (Dirac vs Majorana) and/or its absolute mass [46], and help to test popular see-saw neutrino mass models and the related mechanism of leptogenesis in the early universe [47].",

At energies of approximately 5-20 GeV, the alteration of the oscillation pat-terns of both \u03bd \u00b5 and \u03bd e events is strong enough to enable PINGU to determine whether the neutrino mass ordering is normal or inverted. Given the current global best fit values of the oscillation parameters, PINGU will determine the ordering with a median significance of 3\u03c3 in approximately 5 years. The significance derived from any actual measurement is subject to large statistical fluctuations, illustrated for PINGU in Fig. 8, so that multiple experimental efforts to measure the ordering are required to guarantee it is determined quickly. For PINGU, the expected significance also depends strongly on the actual value of \u03b8 23 , which is not well known. The expectation of 5 years to reach 3\u03c3 significance is conservative in the sense that PINGU's sensitivity to the NMO would be greater in almost any region of the allowed parameter space of \u03b8 23 other than the current global best fit, as shown in Fig. 8.",

However, in contrast to the CKM matrix in the quark sector, the unitarity of the mixing between the three known neutrino flavors has not been experimentally verified. Many theories of physics beyond the Standard Model include massive fermionic singlets which could mix with neutrinos, expanding the standard 3 \u00d7 3 PMNS neutrino mixing matrix into an extended (3 + N ) \u00d7 (3 + N ) matrix and implying that the 3 \u00d7 3 PMNS submatrix is non-unitary. The unitarity of PMNS mixing has only been tested at the 20%-40% level, primarily due to the lack of direct measurements of \u03bd \u03c4 oscillations [51]. An extended mixing matrix could either decrease or moderately increase the rate of \u03bd \u03c4 appearance relative to the Standard Model expectation.

Neutrino oscillation tomography relies on the MSW effect, which depends on the electron density. Seismic measurements by contrast are sensitive to the mass density and have resulted in a very precise determination of the Earth matter density profile, so the composition can be extracted from comparison of the two measurements. Although this technique is affected by unknown neutrino physics, especially the octant of \u03b8 23 , information regarding the Earth's composition can be extracted with uncertainties in the oscillation physics and density profile treated as nuisance parameters.

The drill will be refurbished and a modified drill melting profile will be used that will significantly reduce the quantity of dissolved gases introduced into the detector region. A water filtration and degassing stage will be added to the drill to assist in removing any remaining residual gases, thus limiting bubble formation. The total cost of drill refurbishment and deployment operations is approximately US$10M. The instrumentation for each string costs approximately US$1.2M; it is anticipated that the bulk of the instrumentation would be provided by non-US participants. Project management and other associated costs are expected to come to an additional US$5M. A summary of costs is shown in  We anticipate that two years will be required for refurbishment and improvement of the hot water drill. Optical module assembly and transportation to the South Pole would occur in parallel. Once the drill and optical modules are available at the South Pole, the full PINGU array can be deployed in two seasons of activity. Some preparatory activity (snow compacting, firn drilling) would be required in the preceding South Pole season to enable a prompt start to deployment once the drill arrives. A summary of the schedule is shown in Figure 10.",
