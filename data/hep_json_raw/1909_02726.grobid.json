Majorana neutrinos would generate neutrinoless double-\u03b2 (0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2) decay, a matter-creating process without the balancing emission of antimatter. So far, 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay has eluded detection. The GERDA collaboration searches for the 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay of 76 Ge by operating bare germanium detectors in an active liquid argon shield. With a total exposure of 82.4 kg\u2022yr, we observe no signal and derive a lower half-life limit of T 1/2 > 0.9 \u2022 10 26 yr (90% C.L.). Our T 1/2 sensitivity assuming no signal is 1.1\u202210 26 yr. Combining the latter with those from other 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay searches yields a sensitivity to the effective Majorana neutrino mass of 0.07 -0.16 eV, with corresponding sensitivities to the absolute mass scale in \u03b2 decay of 0.15 -0.44 eV, and to the cosmological relevant sum of neutrino masses of 0.46 -1.3 eV.",

This flavor oscillation is only possible if neutrinos have non-zero mass which is currently the only established contradiction to the standard model (SM) of particle physics.

The Ge material is enriched in the 76 Ge isotope from the natural abundance of 7.8% to > 85% and transformed into high-purity Ge detectors. Thus the 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay source and detector are identical as illustrated in Fig. 1. In total, GERDA deploys 37 enriched detectors with two different geometries (coaxial and Broad Energy Ge (BEGe) detectors) and with a total mass of 35.6 kg as bare crystals in 63 m 3 of liquid argon (LAr). The LAr serves as high-purity shielding against radiation from radioactive decays, and it also provides cooling for the Ge Figure 1: In 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay two electrons (\u03b2 particles) escape the nucleus (a) and deposit energy Q \u03b2\u03b2 very localized in a single detector (b).

Events with coincident LAr scintillation light or with multiple interactions in the Ge detector, e.g. Compton scatters (c), are classified as background events. The special detector design with a small readout electrode enhances drift time differences between different trajectories (black dashed lines) of the charges (holes) generated by the energy depositions. The color code indicates the electrical signal strength at the respective location. Hence singleand multi-site events can be identified efficiently by the time profile of their electronic signal. Similarly, \u03b1 decays at the readout electrode (d) show unique signal characteristics.",

A rock overburden of about 3500 m water equivalent eliminates the hadronic and electromagnetic components of the cosmic ray air showers and reduces the cosmic muon flux to about 1.25/(m 2 \u2022h). The array of high-purity Ge detectors with 76 Ge fraction enriched up to more than 85% ( enr Ge) is operated in a 64 m 3 cryostat filled with high-purity (N5.0) liquid argon (LAr). The liquified noble gas serves both as coolant for the detectors as well as a shield against external background radiation. The vacuum-insulated cryostat (\u00d8 4 m) is produced from stainless steel of low radioactivity [28]. A 6 cm layer of low background copper on its inner wall shields the radioactivity of the steel. The shield is complemented by 590 m 3 of high-purity water (18 M\u2126\u2022cm) contained in a tank (\u00d8 10 m, h = 9 m) surrounding the cryostat. This design has been shown to suppress the external \u03b3 background at Q \u03b2\u03b2 =2039 keV to a level of less than 10 \u22125 cts/(keV\u2022kg\u2022yr) [29]. Muons crossing the water tank are detected with 66 8\" photo multiplier tubes (PMTs) by their Cherenkov radiation; together with plastic scintillator panels covering 4\u00d73 m 2 on the roof of the experiment a muon rejection efficiency of >99.9% is achieved [30].",

Indicated are the n+ contact of diffused lithium (black) and the p+ contact of ion-implanted boron (gray), separated by an insulating groove. Overlayed in the active volume of the detectors is the weighting potential, which describes the coupling of the charge at a given location to the respective electrode. For BEGe detectors, it is strongly peaked close to the small readout electrode, yielding to first order a pulse shape independent of the interaction position for most of the volume; the signal timing reflects the position-dependent drift time. This enables a simple discrimination between events with single and multiple interactions in the detector. Such a discrimination is more complex in case of coaxial detectors which feature a wider variety of signal shape patterns depending on the interaction position.",

The key is the further reduction of background events from the array surroundings in order to reach the 'background-free' regime [13]. Major progress is due to (i) the deployment of additional enr Ge detectors of the BEGe type (Canberra Semiconductor / Mirion) that exhibit superior pulse shape discrimination (PSD) and energy resolution [33], and (ii) the instrumentation of the LAr volume around the detector array with light sensors that allow for the active shielding (LAr veto) of events causing signals in both the Ge detectors Table S1: Characteristics of the HPGe detectors (GDxyZ denoting the BEGe detectors) used in GERDA Phase II, for more details see [14].

The latter consists of a fiber curtain (green) read out on top by silicon photo-multipliers (not shown), and 7 or 9 photo multiplier tubes at the bottom and top (not shown) of the array, respectively. Omitted from the view are also the signal and high voltage cables of the individual detectors as well as the transparent nylon shrouds that enclose each of the seven detector strings in order to block the accumulation of 42 K ions at the detectors. The LAr veto system is a hybrid system evolved from studies of scintillation light detection in LAr with PMTs [36] and silicon photo-multipliers (SiPMs) coupled to wavelength shifting fibers for increased light detection efficiency [37]. Its central part (\u00d8 = 0.5 m, h \u2248 1.0 m) consists of a curtain of 1\u00d71 mm 2 multiclad fibers (Saint Gobain, BCF-91A) which are vacuumcoated with wavelength shifting tetraphenyl butadiene (TPB). The fibers are arranged such that their geometrical coverage is 78% by design. Observed misalignments indicate, however, that coverage might be as low as 50%. In total 405 fibers of about 1.8 m length are deployed. Groups of nine fibers are bent in a U-shape such that both ends can be coupled on top of the curtain to two 3\u00d73 mm 2 SiPM arrays (Ketek). For readout, six SiPMs are connected in parallel to a 50 \u2126 coaxial cable which transmits the signals to the outside for amplification in a charge sensitive preamplifier. Additionally, 16 low-radioactivity PMTs (Hamamatsu, 3\" R11065-10/20 MOD) with a TPB coated entrance window are installed in the cryostat. Groups of 9 and 7 PMTs are located in a distance of about 1 m from the Ge detectors above and below the array, respectively. The PMTs and the fiber/SiPM assembly are mounted in a low-mass copper frame which can be deployed together with the detector array into the cryostat.",

Pulse shape discrimination Events from 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decays are homogeneously distributed in the detector volume and the energy deposition is typically contained within 1 mm 3 (i.e. single-site events, SSEs). There are two types of background events that can be distinguished from these signal-like events using pulse shape discrimination (PSD): multiple energy depositions due to \u03b3 rays (i.e. multiple-site events, MSEs) and surface events due to \u03b1 or \u03b2 decays on the detector n+ or p+ electrode. Energy depositions near the n+ electrode of the detector can create pulses with long risetimes and incomplete charge collection due to the low electric field in the undepleted part of the Li diffusion layer. On the other hand, energy depositions near the p+ electrode result in fast signals because both electrons and holes drift simultaneously through volumes of large weighting potentials; hence the combined contribution has a shorter rise time. Since the n+ electrode has a dead surface layer with about 1 mm thickness, that blocks \u03b1 particles, they can reach the detector active volume only through the much thinner dead layer of the p+ electrode and the groove.",

Figs. 2 and 3 of this reference [33] show typical examples of pulse shapes from BEGe and coaxial detectors, respectively. In the case of the BEGe detectors one parameter, A/E, is used to reject background events, where A is the maximum current amplitude and E is the energy, proportional to the area of the current pulse. As MSEs and n+ surface events are characterized by wider current pulses, they feature a lower A/E value compared to SSEs, while p+ surface events show a higher A/E. Therefore rejecting events on both sides of the A/E distribution of SSEs enhances the signal to background ratio. Due to their different geometry and electric field configuration, the coaxial detectors have more complicated patterns of SSE pulses than the BEGe type detectors. Therefore an artificial neural network (ANN) is used to discriminate between SSEs and MSEs. In addition to these cuts that were already applied in the previous data releases of GERDA, a cut on the coaxial detector pulse risetime is now also applied to reject fast signals from surface events due to \u03b1 decays near the p+ electrode and in the groove.",

In the case of BEGe detectors, the DEP survival fraction is assumed as an estimate of the 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 survival fraction. Differences between the expected 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay signal and DEP events are taken into account in the systematic uncertainties: DEP events are more likely to occur close to the sides and edges of the detector while 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay events are distributed equally in the detector volume, this introduces about 1% difference based on GEANT4 simulations. Additionally, because of its higher energy, the 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay signal has a higher fraction of MSEs that introduces an additional 2% uncertainty based on GEANT4 simulations. Finally, the uncertainty of the DEP survival fraction is estimated by shifting the low A/E threshold by its uncertainty. This is based on the agreement of A/E distributions between physics and calibration data and on differences between methods to determine the cut value. The threshold has been shifted by 0.2 resulting in a 1.7% relative uncertainty on the DEP survival fraction.

The survival fraction of peaks in the calibration data and of the 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay events in physics data has been reproduced with pulse shape simulations within a few percent. This gives confidence in the survival fraction of 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay signal estimated from the simulations that is found to be (84 \u00b1 5)%. The uncertainty has been estimated studying the energy dependence with event samples from calibration data with rescaled noise corresponding to lower effective energies. The survival fraction of the different event samples as a function of this effective energy is shown in Fig. S10 for both the ANN and the RT cuts. The ANN shows a slightly different energy dependence for each event sample, suggesting that the cut does not only depend on the noise but also on the topology of the event sample. Using the slopes from the different event samples to extrapolate the survival fraction from the 2\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay survival fraction gives a conservative systematic uncertainty of \u00b15%.

It forms a 'dead layer', shielding the detector efficiently from all radiations that cannot penetrate this barrier, like surface \u03b1 particles, in particular. The very thin p+ contact and the groove on the other hand do not provide such a shield.A depletion region is formed by reverse biasing the p-n+ junction, i.e. by applying positive high voltage to the n+ contact while keeping the p+ electrode grounded for signal read out.Full depletion of the active region is typically reached at a few kilovolts. Due to the electric field the electron-hole pairs created by ionizing radiation are separated and drift into opposite directions.

If instabilities on the order of 1 keV or above are observed, the corresponding data is excluded from analysis, and a calibration run is performed immediately. This strict approach is needed to preserve the excellent energy resolution of the Ge detectors when the data collected over an extended period of time are combined into a single data set.The different assumptions and approximations used in the calibration procedure can result in minor biases of the energy scale at Q \u03b2\u03b2 . For example, a linear calibration function describes the energy scale only approximately due to the non-linearities in the read-out chain. The overall biases can be estimated by analyzing the peak positions in the combined calibration spectrum. The combined calibration spectrum is obtained by summing up calibrated spectra of all calibration runs for each detector separately.Fig. S4shows the residuals of prominent peaks in the combined spectrum for the different detectors. Close to the 583 keV and 2615 keV peaks the residuals are typically around 0.05 keV, as these two are the strongest lines that have the largest weight in the fit of the calibration function. Between these two lines the residuals are larger, typically around a few tenths of keV. We estimate a systematic uncertainty of 0.2 keV on the energy scale at Q \u03b2\u03b2 = 2039 for both the BEGe and coaxial datasets using the average absolute deviation of individual detectors from the datasets at the closest spectral line at 2104 keV.

The bore-hole of the coaxial detector allows for the depletion of a large volume, i.e. for the production of detectors with masses up to 3 kg and beyond, while the small p+ contact restricts the mass of BEGe detectors to less than 1 kg. For larger masses a BEGe detector can not be fully depleted for voltages below 5 kV. On the other hand, the small readout electrode of a BEGe detector implies a lower detector capacitance, 1 pF vs. 30 pF, and hence lower series noise resulting in superior energy resolution. It is also the key for the superior PSD power of the BEGe detectors.The signals of the Ge detectors are amplified by low radioactivity, charge-sensitive preamplifiers[35] of 30 MHz bandwidth, operated 35 cm above the top of the detector array in the LAr. The signals are led via \u223c 10 m long coaxial cables to the outside of the lock where they are digitized (see next paragraph)",

In the Bayesian case, a prior probability distribution for the half-life is updated using information from the data to yield a posterior distribution. Hence a direct measurement/limit of T 1/2 is the result -however depending on the somewhat arbitrary choice of the prior. In the frequentist analysis no direct statement on T 1/2 can be inferred. Instead, for all true T 1/2 values in the extracted (90%) confidence interval, the chance that an experiment sees a signal strength (or best-fit T 1/2 ) like in our data is 90%. The meaning of this frequentist statement is often ignored and the confidence interval is interpreted as an exclusion of model parameters. Because of the frequentist construction, data fluctuations can lead to surprising features: improving the experiment by increase of exposure might lead to poorer limits on T 1/2 like it happened for EXO-200 [25], or the limit is much stronger than the sensitivity of the experiment -the median limit on T 1/2 expected from many repetitions of the experiment assuming no 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 decay signal -like it is the case for CUORE [24] and all KamLAND-Zen results (see [26] and refs. therein).

Hence the combination of the sensitivities from the experiments listed in Table 1 has been evaluated for each set of NME calculations separately assuming implicitly that each set provides for each isotope the correct NME. The T 1/2 sensitivity of each experiment is converted into an equivalent T 1/2 sensitivity for 76 Ge according to eq. 7.
