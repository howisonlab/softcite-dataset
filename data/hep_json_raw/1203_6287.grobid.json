The asymmetry amplitudes extracted from this data set are more precise than those extracted from the earlier data set of 1996-2005 previously analysed in the same manner by Hermes. The results from the two data sets are compatible with each other. Results from these combined data sets are extracted and constitute the most precise asymmetry amplitude measurements made in the Hermes kinematic region using a missing-mass event selection technique.",

            "text": "Generalised Parton Distributions (GPDs) [1][2][3] encompass the familiar Parton Distribution Functions (PDFs) and nucleon Form Factors (FFs) to provide a comprehensive description of the structure of the nucleon. A thorough description of the nucleon in terms of GPDs would allow the deduction of the total angular momentum of partons in the nucleon, and the construction of a longitudinal-momentum-dissected transverse spatial map of parton densities [4]. The GPDs appear in experimental measurements in the form of complexvalued Compton Form Factors (CFFs), which are flavour-sums of convolutions of GPDs with hard scattering kernels. Constraints on these CFFs, and thus GPDs, can be obtained from measurements of exclusive leptoproduction processes. In particular, the exclusive leptoproduction of a single real photon from a nucleon or nucleus that remains intact (e N \u2192 e N \u03b3; see figure 1) is the simplest to describe and is the most widely-used reaction channel for such work (see ). Generalised parton distributions depend upon four kinematic variables: the Mandelstam variable t = (p\u2212p ) 2 , which is the squared momentum transfer to the target nucleon in the exclusive scattering process with p (p ) representing the initial (final) four-momentum of the nucleon; the average fraction x of the nucleon's longitudinal momentum carried by the active quark throughout the scattering process; half the difference of the fractions of the nucleon's longitudinal momentum carried by the active quark at the start and end of  Figure 1. (a): The leading DVCS process in which an electron/positron (e) interacts with a quark in the nucleon (N ) via a virtual photon (\u03b3 * ). The quark is found in the nucleon with longitudinal momentum fraction x + \u03be and emits a real photon (\u03b3). The quark is absorbed by the nucleon with longitudinal momentum fraction x \u2212 \u03be. (b): The leading Bethe-Heitler process, i.e. the emission of a real photon from the incoming or outgoing lepton. This process has the same initial and final states as DVCS.",

Exclusive leptoproduction of real photons arises from two experimentally indistinguishable processes: the Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering (DVCS) process, which is the emission of a real photon by the struck quark from the nucleon, and the Bethe-Heitler (BH) process, which is elastic lepton-nucleon scattering with the emission of a bremsstrahlung photon by the lepton. The BH process is calculable in the QED framework; this process is dominant at the kinematic conditions of the Hermes experiment. The two processes interfere and the large BH amplitude amplifies the interference term, which is proportional to the DVCS amplitude. It is through the study of this interference term that useful information for the constraint of certain GPDs can be obtained at Hermes kinematic conditions, especially since the interference term is the only part of the squared scattering amplitude that is linear in CFFs [28].",

The contribution to the uncertainties on the amplitude measurements arising from background in the data from neutral meson production is predominantly due to the failure to identify one of the two photons from the decay of these neutral mesons. It is possible that both photons from the decay of a neutral meson could be boosted into a single calorimeter cluster and thus be reconstructed as a single photon produced in the BH or DVCS processes. It is similarly possible that the trajectory of one of the produced photons goes outwith the spectrometer acceptance and that the remaining photon is mistaken for one produced by the BH or DVCS processes. The A DVCS LU amplitudes are corrected for the fraction of the data sample and the magnitude of the asymmetry due to semi-inclusive pion production. A further uncertainty is assigned to these amplitudes for the influence of photons produced in decays of exclusively produced pions. Corrections for dilution of the amplitudes for the A I LU and A C asymmetries are applied. No asymmetry value is assigned to the influence of the dilution because influences from meson production are expected to vanish when considering the difference between beam charges. The procedure for estimating the uncertainty and correction factor for each measured amplitude value is described in detail in refs. [8,9].

In order to quantify these effects, events were generated using a Monte Carlo simulation of the spectrometer that included them. An event generator based on the GPD model described in refs. [36,37] was used for the simulation because its output describes the data well and it was employed in ref. [9]. Asymmetry amplitudes were extracted from these simulated events using the same analysis procedure used to extract amplitudes from experimental data. In each kinematic bin, the systematic uncertainty was determined as the difference between the asymmetry amplitude reconstructed from the simulated data and that calculated from the GPD model at the average \u2212t, x B and Q 2 value for that bin. The MC simulation shows that, in terms of kinematic smearing, the data sample is 99.9% pure in each of the large \"overall\" bins. In the kinematic projections, the best purity is found in the sixth Q 2 bin, which is 98% pure. The least pure bin is the third bin in \u2212t, where approximately one-third of the events reconstructed in this bin are generated from outwith it. None of the bins average kinematic values are shown to be shifted by more than 5% as a result of kinematic smearing and the typical effect is a shift in the average kinematic values of a bin on the order of 1%.",

The total systematic uncertainty for the 2006-2007 data sample was determined for each kinematic bin by adding in quadrature the uncertainties arising from the background correction, the missing-mass shifts, and the detector effects. The 1996-2005 sample also has a systematic uncertainty from misalignment of the spectrometer [9], which has been eliminated for the 2006-2007 data sample due to improved surveying measurements. However, because the systematic uncertainty calculation for the 2006-2007 data uses the same Monte Carlo generator and reconstruction technique as was used for the 1996-2005 data, the systematic uncertainty for 2006-2007 is overestimated; this overestimate is very slight, because the systematic uncertainty contribution from potential misalignment affecting the asymmetries extracted from the 1996-2005 data set is very small [32]. Table 2 shows, for each physically-motivated amplitude extracted from the 2006-2007 data (in a single, overall kinematic bin), the contribution of the various systematic uncertainties. The beam polarisation measurements have total uncertainties of 2.8% for the 1996-2005 data-taking period and 3.4% for the 2006-2007 data taking period.

The solid curves represent the model fit without data from the Jefferson Lab Hall A Collaboration [22]; the model fit represented by the dashed curves includes these data.

The dash-dotted curves in figures 4 and 5 show the result of calculations from a fit based on a quark-diquark model with a Regge-inspired term that is included in order to describe accurately parton distribution functions at low x values [42]. The \"Regge\" term is extended to include contributions that determine the t-dependence of the corresponding GPD. The model incorporates fits to global deep-inelastic and elastic scattering data (to account for the \u03be-independent limits and moments of the underlying GPDs) and DVCS data JHEP07(2012)032 from Jefferson Lab (to describe the skewness dependence).

Analogous asymmetry amplitudes were extracted previously from hydrogen data obtained during the 1996-2005 experimental period as described in ref. [9]. A comparison of the amplitudes extracted from these independent data sets has shown that they are compatible and the asymmetry amplitudes can therefore be extracted from the complete 1996-2007 data set. The asymmetry amplitudes extracted from the complete data set are the most statistically precise DVCS measurements presented by Hermes. There is a strong signal in the first harmonic of the interference contribution to the beam-helicity asymmetry. There are non-zero amplitudes in the zeroth and first harmonics of the beam-charge asymmetry. All asymmetry amplitudes related to higher harmonics are consistent with zero. The results from the complete data set are JHEP07(2012)032 compared to calculations from ongoing work to fit GPD models to experimental data. All asymmetry amplitudes are also presented as projections in \u2212t in bins of x B . No additional features are observed in any particular x B -bin.
