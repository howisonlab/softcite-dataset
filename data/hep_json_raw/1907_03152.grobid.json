Proton-proton collision data recorded by the CMS experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV were used, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb \u22121 . The search is sensitive to neutral Higgs bosons produced via the gluon fusion process or in association with a bb quark pair. No significant deviations from the standard model expectation are observed. Upper limits at 95% confidence level are set in the context of the m mod+ h and phenomenological MSSM scenarios on the parameter tan \u03b2 as a function of the mass of the pseudoscalar A boson, in the range from 130 to 600 GeV. The results are also used to set a model-independent limit on the product of the branching fraction for the decay into a muon pair and the cross section for the production of a scalar neutral boson, either via gluon fusion, or in association with b quarks, in the mass range from 130 to 1000 GeV.",

However, the SM is known to be incomplete, and several well-motivated theoretical models beyond the SM predict an extended Higgs sector. One example is supersymmetry [6,7] that protects the mass of the Higgs boson against quadratically divergent quantum corrections. In the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) [8][9][10], the Higgs sector consists of two Higgs doublets, one of which couples to up-type fermions and the other to down-type fermions. Assuming that CP symmetry is conserved, this results in two charged bosons H \u00b1 , two neutral scalar bosons, h and H, and one pseudoscalar boson, A.",

The masses of the other four Higgs bosons can be expressed as a function of these two parameters. Beyond the tree level the MSSM Higgs sector depends on additional parameters, which enter via higher-order corrections in perturbation theory, and which are E-mail address: cms -publication -committee -chair @cern .ch. usually fixed to values motivated by experimental constraints and theoretical assumptions. Setting these parameters defines a benchmark scenario [11], which is then described by m A and tan \u03b2. The relevant scenarios are those consistent with a mass of one neutral boson of 125 GeV for the majority of the probed m A -tan \u03b2 parameter space [12], and not ruled out by other existing measurements. In particular, the m mod+ h scenario [11] constrains the mass of the h boson to be near 125 GeV for a wide range of tan \u03b2 and m A values, by tuning some of the MSSM parameters. In the phenomenological MSSM (hMSSM) [13][14][15][16] the mass of h boson is an input parameter, set to 125 GeV, and the observed neutral boson is interpreted as the h boson. Small differences in the cross sections and branching fractions exist between the two models, although the kinematics of the Higgs bosons remains almost identical.",

This is also the case of the h boson for values of m A 200 GeV, while, in the decoupling regime, the h boson production mechanisms correspond to those predicted by the SM. Fig. 1 shows the Feynman diagrams for the two production processes at leading order (LO). The gluon fusion mechanism is more relevant for tan \u03b2 30, whereas at LO, the coupling of the Higgs boson to down-type fermions is enhanced by tan \u03b2, resulting in b-associated production becoming more important at large tan \u03b2. The coupling of the neutral Higgs boson to charged leptons is enhanced for the same reason. Although the branching fraction to muons is predicted to be about 300 times smaller than that for the \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 final state, the \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 channel can be fully reconstructed, and the dimuon invariant mass can be measured with a precision of a few percent by exploiting the excellent muon momentum resolution of the CMS detector, making the dimuon final state an additional probe of the MSSM.",

These are the trigger algorithms with the lowest p T threshold whose output is not artificially reduced to limit the event rate and that cover the entire \u03b7 acceptance of the muon detector. Since the Higgs boson signal is searched for over a large mass range, the p T of the muons from its decay can vary from tens to hundreds of GeV. Therefore, two sets of muon identification (ID) criteria are employed in the analysis: one is optimized for muons with lower p T ( 200 GeV) (ID1) and the other for muons with larger p T (ID2). Events with a pair of opposite-charge muons, coming from the PV, are selected requiring both muons to satisfy the same ID criterion.

Events containing b-jet candidates provide the highest sensitivity for the b-associated production channel, and events that do not contain b-tagged jets provide the best sensitivity for the gluon fusion production channel. The events are therefore split into two exclusive categories: the b-tag category, containing events with strictly one b jet and at most one additional untagged jet, and the no-b-tag category, containing events without b-tagged jets. In the first category, the requirement of strictly one b jet is aimed at suppressing about 30% of the dominant background from top quark pairs, since the observed b-tagged jet multiplicity in tt events is on average higher than for the Higgs boson signal. This is because more than half of the signal events from b-associated production are characterized by b jets emitted at large \u03b7, out of the acceptance of the tracking detector, and failing the b-tag requirements, whereas b jets in tt events are preferentially emitted in the central \u03b7 region. Therefore, discarding events with two or more b-tagged jets allows the tt background to be rejected without any major impact on the signal efficiency.

A global correction, calculated as the product of the various scale factors, is applied as an event-by-event weight. The uncertainty associated with each scale factor is then propagated to the analysis and its impact on the final selection efficiency is assigned as systematic uncertainty. An event-by-event weight is also applied to account for the modeling of the pileup in the simulation. The uncertainty in the knowledge of the pileup multiplicity is evaluated by varying the total inelastic cross section [85,86] by \u00b15%, which translates into an uncertainty smaller than 1% in the signal efficiency. The uncertainty associated with the jet energy scale [87] is estimated by rescaling the jet momentum by a factor depending on the p T and \u03b7 of each jet. This variation is also propagated to the p miss T determination. Its effect on the signal selection efficiency is about 1.6 (0.4)% for the b-tag (no-b-tag) category. Systematic uncertainties in the unclustered energy are propagated to the determination of p miss T .

The \u03c6 boson is assumed to be produced entirely either via the b-associated or the gluon fusion process, and the analysis is performed separately for the two production mechanisms. Fig. 6 shows the 95% CL upper limits on the cross section times the decay branching fraction to \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 as a function of the \u03c6 mass for a narrow resonance. These limits are more stringent by a factor of 2 to 3 than those recently obtained by ATLAS in a similar search [22]. The corresponding upper limits assuming a signal template with a width equal to 10% of its mass value are shown in Fig. 7. In the case of large signal widths, the upper limits as a function of m \u03c6 start from 140 GeV. This is done to have the signal peak \u00b13 within the fit range. Moreover, as one may expect, the limits are less stringent than for the narrow-width approximation, and it is no longer possible to distinguish the fine structure of the 95% CL limits as a function of the mass, as observed for the narrow-width case.",
