Recent measurements have been erformed by BABAR (2007 [1]), Belle (2005 [2]), and CDF (2005 [3]). A detailed comparison can be found in Sec. VII. The decay can be decomposed in terms of three transversity states, corresponding to the relative orientation of the linear polarization vectors of the two vector mesons. The amplitudes are referred to as P-wave amplitudes since the K system is in a P-wave state and are denoted by A 0 (longitudinal), A k (transverse-parallel), and A ? (transverse-perpendicular), where the relative orientations are shown in parentheses. An additional S-wave amplitude corresponding to a nonresonant K system is denoted by A S . The strong phases of the four amplitudes are 0 , k , ? , and S , respectively, and by convention 0 is set to zero. The parity of the final states is even for A 0 and A k , and odd for A ? and A S .",

The detector includes a high-precision tracking system consisting of a silicon-strip vertex detector surrounding the pp interaction region, a large-area silicon-strip detector located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4 Tm, and three stations of silicon-strip detectors and straw drift tubes placed downstream. The combined tracking system provides a momentum measurement with relative uncertainty that varies from 0.4% at 5 GeV=c to 0.6% at 100 GeV=c, and impact parameter resolution of 20 m for tracks with high transverse momentum (p T ). Different types of charged hadrons are distinguished by information from two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors [18]. Photon, electron, and hadron candidates are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter, and a hadronic calorimeter. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers. The trigger consists of a hardware stage, based on information from the calorimeter and muon systems, followed by a software stage, which applies a full event reconstruction. In the simulation, pp collisions are generated using PYTHIA 6.4  [19] with a specific LHCb  configuration [20]. Decays of hadronic particles are described by EVTGEN [21], in which final state radiation is generated using PHOTOS [22]. The interaction of the generated particles with the detector and its response are implemented using the GEANT4 toolkit [23] as described in Ref. [24].",
