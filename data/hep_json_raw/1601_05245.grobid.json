DeepCore, the low energy extension of IceCube, has started making meaningful measurements of the neutrino oscillation parameters 23 and | m 2 32 | by analyzing the atmospheric flux at energies above 10 GeV. PINGU, a proposed project to lower DeepCore's energy threshold, aims to use the same flux to further increase the precision with which these parameters are known, and eventually determine the sign of m 2 32 . The latest results from DeepCore, and the planned transition to PINGU, are discussed here.",

            "text": "The amplitude of oscillation probabilities depends on the mixing of flavor and mass eigenstates, encoded in mixing angles ij . The oscillation phase is proportional to m 2 ij L/E, where L is the distance traveled by the neutrino, E is its energy and m 2 ij is the squared mass difference of the mass eigenstates. Atmospheric neutrinos are produced with energies from MeV to the TeV-scale and can travel distances as large as the Earth's diameter before detection. This means that experiments measuring these neutrinos are sensitive to the mass-splitting m 2 32 and the mixing angles 23 and 13 over a wide L/E range [2]. Current VLVNTs can measure atmospheric neutrinos starting at approximately 10 GeV [3,4], and future proposed telescopes aim to lower the threshold to a few GeV [5,6]. Neutrinos crossing the Earth at these energies undergo neutrino-electron coherent forward scattering, which affects how they oscillate [7]. Between E \u03bd \u2248 1 \u2212 12 GeV, this leads to large deviations from vacuum oscillations for neutrinos or antineutrinos, depending on the ordering of the neutrino masses [8][9][10]. Above this energy range saturation occurs and, while oscillation probabilities still differ from those in vacuum, they are the same for neutrinos and antineutrinos regardless of the neutrino mass ordering.",

A muon hypothesis is fit to the event with track lengths ranging from zero (i.e. ultimately a cascade-like event) to the detector's size. Only a handful of the photons emitted in low energy neutrino interactions are observed by DeepCore, and these photons may scatter multiple times before being detected. The latest DeepCore results [12] relied on finding unscattered photons to aid the event selection and event reconstruction. Unscattered, or direct, photons are identified by restricting the patterns formed by their arrival time to a string. While requiring 5 or more direct photons results in a 30% signal efficiency, this criterion keeps the subset of the detected neutrinos whose direction can be easily reconstructed. The muon track direction is fit using these photons, following [16]. Since the light produced by a cascade is also preferentially emitted in the Cherenkov angle events without a muon are also fit, although the resolution obtained is significantly worse. The neutrino interaction position, the energy of the hadronic cascade at the interaction point, and the range of the muon produced are fit in a second step using all photons recorded by the detector while the direction along which these parameters are varied is kept fixed. At E \u03bd = 15 GeV, the resulting median zenith angle resolution is 10 \u2022 for \u03bd and 25 \u2022 for \u03bd e , while the median energy resolution is 25% for both.",

It uses a maximum likelihood estimator where the expected time of arrival of photons to a DOM given a particle hypothesis is finely binned. The effects of the optical properties of the South Pole ice are taken into account. In contrast to the method described above, this approach has the advantages of being able to reconstruct nearly all neutrino events (no direct photons are required) and of producing a significantly better directional reconstruction for events without a muon present. Other resolutions obtained are comparable. The maximum likelihood reconstruction is applied to study the performance of PINGU, where the energy and zenith angle resolutions are expected to improve by approximately 30%.",

The classification stabilizes at E \u03bd \u2265 30 GeV, and above this energy it correctly identifies 60% of CC \u03bd , while misidentifying 30% of cascades.

The oscillation parameters requried for the two templates are selected so that they result in the case of \"maximum confusion\" between hierarchies. Each pseudo-experiment is fit under the assumption of both hierarchies and the likelihood ratio is calculated. The separation between the resulting distributions serves as an estimate of the confidence with which the two hypotheses can be discriminated. The second method used in PINGU is a simplified 2 approach. This is a fast parametric analysis of the Fisher information matrix [24] and relies on the partial derivatives of the event counts in each bin with respect to the parameters under study. The results obtained from the simplified 2 and the likelihood ratio approaches have been found to be in agreement, and both are used to report the projected sensitivity of PINGU.",
