A model-independent measurement is performed using the binned Dalitz plot technique. The measured value is \u03d51 = 11.7 \u2022 \u00b1 7.8 \u2022 (stat.) \u00b1 2.1 \u2022 (syst.). Treating sin 2\u03d51 and cos 2\u03d51 as independent parameters, we obtain sin 2\u03d51 = 0.43 \u00b1 0.27 (stat.) \u00b1 0.08 (syst.) and cos 2\u03d51 = 1.06 \u00b1 0.33 (stat.) +0.21   \u22120.15 (syst.). The results are obtained with a full data sample of 772 \u00d7 10 6 BB pairs collected near the \u03a5(4S) resonance with the Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric-energy e + e \u2212 collider.",

            "text": "The study of CP symmetry provides valuable insight into the structure and dynamics of matter from the subatomic to the cosmic scale. CP violation is a necessary ingredient for baryogenesis and explaining the state of matter in the observable Universe [1]. The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics accounts for CP viola-tion using the mechanism proposed by Kobayashi and Maskawa (KM)  [2]. A unitary matrix of quark flavor mixing, referred to as the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) [2,3] matrix, encodes this mechanism. The CKM matrix makes charged weak currents non-invariant under CP transformation. The SM does not predict the values of the elements of the CKM matrix, but theoretical predictions estimate that the amount of CP violation in-troduced by the SM is too feeble to explain the baryon asymmetry of the Universe [4]. Thus, it is important to test the KM mechanism and search for new sources of CP violation. Unitarity of the CKM matrix implies several relations among its elements that can be represented as triangles in the complex plane. In particular, the relation formed by the elements of the first and the third columns, referred to as the Unitarity Triangle (UT) [5], is the most accessible for experimental tests.",

This partially wrong combination leads to correlated shift both in \u2206E and M bc . A similar correlation appears in the distributions of the background from partially reconstructed B decays. The width of the signal \u2206E distribution for the B candidates with the \u03b7 or \u03c9 reconstructed in the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 final state is determined by the charged final state particles momentum resolution if both final state photons are correctly assigned. For such candidates, the \u2206E and M bc distributions are correlated. That correlation is accommodated by introducing a \u2206E dependence of the signal M bc PDF parameters. This parameterization is equivalent to a two-dimensional Gaussian function. No significant correlation is found for the combinatorial background.
