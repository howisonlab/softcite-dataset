            "text": "Due to the confining nature of the strong force, directly measuring the quantum chromodynamic (QCD) interactions between quarks and gluons is not possible. The strength and direction of the strong force depends on the colour charge of the particles involved. To a good approximation, the radiation pattern in QCD can be described through a colour-connection picture, which consists of colour strings connecting quarks and gluons of one colour to quarks and gluons of the corresponding anti-colour. An important question is whether there is evidence of these colour connections (colour flow) in the observable objects: colour-neutral hadrons and the jets they form. The study of energy distributions inside and between jets in various topologies has a long history, dating back to the discovery of gluons in three-jet events at PE-TRA [1][2][3][4]. Colour connections are still a poorly constrained QCD effect, which motivates the dedicated study presented in this Letter. If well understood, experiments can exploit colour flow to aid Standard Model (SM) measurements and searches for physics beyond the SM (BSM). As a test that the colour flow can be extracted from the observable final state, the data are compared to models with simulated W bosons that are colour-charged or colourneutral.",

This is shown graphically in Fig. 1, and the angle is called the pull angle, denoted \u03b8 P ( J 1 , J 2 ). The pull angle is symmetric around zero when it takes values between \u2212\u03c0 and \u03c0 and so henceforth \u03b8 P ( J 1 , J 2 ) refers to the magnitude of the angle in ( y, \u03c6) space with 0 < \u03b8 P \u2264 \u03c0 .

Cylindrical coordinates (r, \u03c6) are used in the transverse plane, \u03c6 being the azimuthal angle around the beam pipe.

Colour-singlet W bosons from tt events provide an excellent testing ground because these bosons have a known initial (colourless) state and such events can be selected with high purity. The first study of colour flow using W bosons from top quark decays was performed by the D\u00d8 Collaboration [6]. In the D\u00d8 analysis, calorimeter cells clustered within jets were used as the constituents in Eq. (1) and the resulting distribution was compared to W singlet (nominal) and W octet templates. The impact of the colour flow on the observable energy distributions is very subtle; the D\u00d8 result was statistically limited and was not able to significantly distinguish singlet and octet radiation patterns.",

The W +jets and multijet backgrounds are estimated from the data using the charge asymmetry and matrix methods, respectively [47]. The other backgrounds are estimated from simulation.

The binning of the response matrix and the number of iterations in the IB method are chosen to minimise the overall uncertainty, described in Section 5. In addition to correcting for bin migrations, the unfolding procedure also corrects for events that pass either the detector-level or particle-level selection, but not both. The corrections are estimated using simulated tt events. Approximately 70% of events that pass the detector-level selection also pass the particle-level selection, while approximately 20% of events that pass the particle-level selection also pass the detector-level selection.

Similarly, uncertainties in the lepton energy scale, trigger efficiency, E miss T resolution and b-tagging efficiencies [17,[58][59][60] indirectly affect the results through changes in acceptance. Other sources of uncertainty on the acceptance, which impact the measurement through the background subtraction, include those related to the luminosity [61], the multijet estimation, and the normalisation and heavy flavour content of the W +jets background [47].",

The change in the result when using a response matrix constructed from the flipped tt simulation is considered as a source of uncertainty on the colour model.

The level of agreement between the data and the Powheg+Pythia models is quantified using \u03c7 2 as a test statistic. A p-value is computed taking into account systematic and statistical uncertainties and their correlations by generating pseudo-datasets from the full covariance matrix and then normalising the pull angle distributions. This p-value is then converted into a one-sided Gaussian equivalent Z -score. The unfolded data are found to agree with the nominal SM colour flow (with Powheg+Pythia) at the 0.8\u03c3 (0.9\u03c3 ) level and differ from the flipped model at 2.9\u03c3 (3.7\u03c3 ) for the all-particles (chargedparticles) pull angle. Although the statistical uncertainty is largely uncorrelated between the all-particles and charged-particles pull angle measurements, the systematic uncertainty is not. Since the charged-particles pull angle measurement is more sensitive than the all-particles pull angle measurement, a full combination of the two measurements does not provide increased sensitivity.",

The measurement uses 20.3 fb \u22121 of \u221a s = 8 TeV pp collision data recorded by the ATLAS detector at the LHC. To quantify the distribution of energy inside one jet relative to another, the distribution of the jet pull angle is extracted from the data using information from both the ATLAS calorimeter and tracking detectors. The jet pull angle is found to correctly characterise the W boson as a colour singlet, with data disfavouring an alternative colour-octet model at greater than 3\u03c3 . This illustrates the potential to use the jet pull angle in future SM measurements and BSM searches. The jet pull angle measurement is presented as a normalised fiducial tt differential cross-section, allowing the results to be used to constrain implementations of colour connection. ",
