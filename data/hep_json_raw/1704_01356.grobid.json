While the focus of the review is on experimental results, a glimpse of the many achievements in related developments in particle physics phenomenology is also given. The introductory part is based on master-level lectures on top-quark physics given at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) and assumes some previous knowledge usually taught in introductory lectures on experimental and theoretical particle physics. In the later parts of the review, a variety of recent results on top-quark physics will be introduced. The focus is on the basic physics and measurement ideas, leaving out many of the details which experimental physicists have spent most of their time on. For a given physics question, the analysis methods, as well as the sensitivities, of the different experiments are often very similar. Therefore the numbers and figures quoted in the review should be taken as illustrative examples.",

In [11,12] the theoretical and phenomenological aspects of top-quark physics are discussed. Further review articles deal with more specialized topics, for example single top-quark production [13,14,15], the top-quark mass [16], tt production asymmetries [17], or top-quark physics at the HERA ep collider [18].",

In Section 2 the basic concepts of top-quark physics are introduced. The most important experimental techniques employed to study top quarks are discussed in Section 3. Some readers may want to skip these introductory chapters and jump directly to the discussion of recent top-quark physics results starting in Section 4. In this chapter measurements of top-quark production in various production and decay channels are introduced. One of the most important measurements in top-quark physics is the determination of the top-quark mass, which will be discussed in Section 5. Further production and decay properties of the top quark, including those expected in beyond standard model (BSM) physics scenarios, have been studied in great detail, as shown in Section 6. The review is completed with a look at the prospects for topquark physics at future collider experiments in Section 7.",

            "text": "In the original quark model by Gell-Mann [21] and Zweig [22], based on the approximate SU (3) symmetry of the mass spectrum of light mesons and baryons [23,24], hadrons consist of the three lightest quarks: up, down, and strange. It was realized by Cabibbo in 1963 that electroweak currents that change the strangeness quantum number of a hadron by one unit (\u2206S = 1) show a different coupling strength than currents with \u2206S = 0 [25]. In modern particle physics language this means that the physical quarks (mass eigenstates) and the quarks that participate in the electroweak interaction (flavor eigenstates) are not aligned, a phenomenon called flavor mixing. A fourth quark, the charm quark, was postulated by Glashow, Iliopoulos, and Maiani in 1970 to explain the strong suppression of flavor-changing neutral current (FCNC) processes such as K 0 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 by the destructive interference of scattering amplitudes with up and charm quarks (\"GIM mechanism\") [26]. The charm quark was discovered by interpreting the J/\u03c8 resonance observed in experiments at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) [27] and Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) [28] as a cc bound state. This discovery completed the second generation of quarks. In both quark generations a quark with a third component of the weak isospin of I 3 = +1/2 and a charge of Q = +2/3 in units of the elementary charge e (\"up-type quark\") and a quark with I 3 = \u22121/2 and charge Q = \u22121/3 (\"down-type quark\") form a weak isospin doublet.",

To shed light on this question, the quantum numbers of the bottom quark were determined in e + e \u2212 collision experiments at Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron (DESY). The cross section for the production and hadronic decay of the \u03a5(1S) resonance in e + e \u2212 collisions is proportional to the partial width of the \u03a5(1S) for decays to electrons, \u0393 ee , which can be related to the bottom-quark charge. The experimental results of the PLUTO collaboration from 1978 favored a charge of Q = \u22121/3 [33]. Measurements of the angular distribution of b hadrons produced in e + e \u2212 collision supported the quantum numbers I 3 = \u22121/2 and Q = \u22121/3 for the bottom quark [34], strongly suggesting that the bottom quark is the down-type quark of the third generation whose I 3 = +1/2 isospin partner was yet to be discovered.",

In quantum field theories, anomalies are symmetries of the Lagrangian that are absent in the full theory including quantum corrections. For a four-dimensional chiral gauge theory to be renormalizable, the chiral anomaly, generated by the non-conservation of gauge currents e. g. in triangle diagrams, must be absent. In the SM the chiral anomaly is \"accidentally\" canceled because there is the same number of quark and lepton flavors, and the number of color charges is three. Hence, to avoid chiral anomalies the third generation of quarks should be a weak isospin doublet, consisting of the bottom quark and its isospin partner, the top quark.",

Additional indirect constraints on m t were derived from the combined analysis of electroweak precision data obtained at the \"Z boson factories\" LEP 1 and SLC.

Starting in 1992, the Tevatron commenced its Run I with the two experiments CDF and D0 taking data with improved detectors. For \"heavy\" top quark masses above approximately 85 GeV the decay t \u2192 W + b is allowed kinematically, which was reflected in modified search strategies at the Tevatron. First indications of an excess of collision events above the background expectation compatible with tt production showed up in the following years [40,42], see Fig. 1 (right). The discovery of the top quark was announced publicly in a joint seminar of the CDF and D0 collaborations at FNAL on March 2, 1995, and published in the journal Physical Review Letters the following day [19,20]. A popular account of the top-quark discovery can be found in [43].",

Typical top-quark analyses were thus performed on data samples of several hundreds to thousands of events containing top quarks. Using the Run-II datasets, the Tevatron experiments have addressed a broad range of questions in top-quark physics, from inclusive production cross sections and precise measurements of the top-quark mass and couplings to a variety of searches for BSM physics with top quarks. At the time of writing this review, many \"legacy\" publications using the full Run-II datasets have already been published, others are being finalized.

Technically PDFs can be accessed conveniently via a common interface provided by the LHAPDF [71] program library.

Starting in the early 2000s, also 2 \u2192 n processes (with n 6) and NLO event generators became available. This increased the precision of MC predictions significantly, as e. g. the emission of additional partons or real and virtual NLO corrections were included in simulated tt events. In parallel automated MC event generators were introduced, first at LO, then also at NLO. These generators are able to automatically compute the full set of contributions to the hard process given the Feynman rules of the underlying theory (both SM and BSM).",

The decay width has been computed in a fully differential way including NNLO QCD corrections and NLO electroweak corrections, which reduce the top-quark decay width by approximately 10% compared to the LO prediction [89,90]. The partial decay width for the decay channel t \u2192 W + q, \u0393(t \u2192 W q), is proportional to the CKM matrix element |V tq | 2 . Experimentally, the relation |V tb | |V ts | > |V td | holds, such that the \"CKM-allowed\" decay t \u2192 W + b is by far the dominant decay mode, with a branching fraction B(t \u2192 W b) \u2261 \u0393(t \u2192 W b)/ q=d,s,b \u0393(t \u2192 W q) = 0.998 expected for a unitary CKM matrix for three quark generations [91]. The inverse of the total decay width, the top-quark mean lifetime, is \u03c4 t = 5 \u00d7 10 \u221225 s. This value is shorter than the typical time scale of hadronization, which can be estimated from the inverse of the energy scale \u039b QCD at which QCD becomes non-perturbative: 1/\u039b QCD \u2248 1/(200 MeV) \u2248 3 \u00d7 10 \u221224 s. This leads to two important consequences: Top quarks decay before hadronization and do not form bound states such as top mesons (tq) or toponium (tt). The top-quark spin polarization and the correlation between spins are largely preserved and can therefore be computed and observed more easily than for other quarks. The fraction of polarization transferred to the decay products, often called the \"spin analyzing power\" \u03ba, is different for the different decay products. The value for the W + boson is \u03ba = 0.39 and for the b quark \u03ba = \u22120.39, and the value for the neutrino or the up-type quark of the W + -boson decay is \u03ba = \u22120.3. The charged lepton or the down-type quark from the W + -boson decay assume the value \u03ba = 1. In an ensemble of 100% polarized top quarks the charged lepton will be emitted parallel to the top-quark spin with the highest probability [12], making charged leptons the most attractive top-quark decay products to study polarization effects.",

It is worth noting that-unlike for any other fundamental fermionthe numerical value of y t is unity to good approximation. This may just be a numerical coincidence, but is often interpreted as a hint of the special role that the top quark could play in BSM physics. The mass of the top quark is not a uniquely defined quantity. In QCD perturbation theory quark masses are renormalized and thus become energyscale dependent. The pole mass (also \"on-shell mass\") m pole t is a seemingly obvious choice to define the top-quark mass. As the top quark does not hadronize it can be considered an unstable \"free\" fermion and its pole mass is defined as the real part of the (renormalized) top-quark propagator's pole. However, this definition is only unique in a given fixed order of QCD perturbation theory. Moreover, as quarks cannot be observed as free particles due to QCD confinement, the full quark propagator does not contain a pole. It can also be shown that certain radiative corrections that have to be considered to all orders (\"infrared renormalon\") are hard to control and lead to irreducible intrinsic uncertainties of the m pole question is if the mass parameter used in MC generators can be identified with m pole t , as MC generators use an energy cut in the parton shower as well as a hadronisation model, both of which cannot be easily mimicked by a perturbative calculation.",

The inclusive intrinsic uncertainty of the topquark pole mass due to renormalon effects has recently been demonstrated to be only 70 MeV [100], much smaller than other uncertainties occuring in measurements of the top-quark mass at hadron colliders. On the other hand, attempts to calibrate the top-quark mass used in MC generators to a shortdistance mass for e + e \u2212 initial states show larger uncertainties of the order of 300 MeV [101].

This makes qq annihilation more likely in pp collisions at the Tevatron compared to pp collisions at the LHC. The center-of-mass energy \u221a s of the collisions determines at which momentum fraction x the partons in the initial state hadrons are probed: to produce a tt pair at rest, the partonic center-of-mass energy \u221a x 1 x 2 s must be equal to twice the top-quark mass. and it becomes increasingly likely to probe a gluon inside the hadrons. At the LHC at \u221a s = 13 TeV, tt production is dominated by gg fusion (approximately 90%), while only 10% of the tt pairs are produced via qq annihilation.",

The magnitude of the tt spin correlation effect depends on the choice of the quantization axes (\"spin basis\"); therefore the spin basis is often chosen to maximize the size of the effect. One typical choice is the beam basis, for which the quantization axis for both the top quark and antiquark is the beam axis in the laboratory frame.

The production processes are classified by the virtuality of the W boson exchanged in the process. The most abundant single top-quark production process at the LHC is t-channel production (SM expectation: 70% of the total cross section), followed by the associated production of a top quark and a real W boson (25%), and s-channel production (5%). At the Tevatron, 70% t-channel and 30% s-channel single top-quark production are predicted by the SM, the W t contribution is negligible. LO Feynman diagrams of these processes are displayed in Fig. 3. The electroweak production vertex contains the CKM matrix element V tb . This offers the opportunity to measure V tb directly in single top-quark production. As the W boson only couples to lefthanded quarks and right-handed antiquarks, the top (anti)quarks produced in the above processes are 100% polarized. Single-top production in the t-channel is mediated by a space-like virtual W boson. The process can be calculated in a scheme in which the initial state b quark originates from flavor excitation in the proton (five-flavor scheme (5FS)). The LO production process in the 5FS is qb \u2192 q t. Alternatively, in the four-flavor scheme (4FS) the LO process is the 2 \u2192 3 process qg \u2192 q tb, where the initial-state gluon splits into a bb pair and one of the b quarks interacts with the virtual W boson to produce the top quark. The \"spectator\" quark q is typically emitted at rather small angles with respect to the beam axis, resulting in one of the most striking signatures of t-channel single top-quark production, a jet at large |\u03b7|.",

The electrons are expected to have large transverse momenta ( 20 GeV) and be well isolated from other particles in the event. The isolation requirement is fulfilled for events in which the sum of track momenta or the sum of energy deposited in the calorimeter in a cone around the electron (excluding the energy of the electron and of bremsstrahlung photons) is below a threshold. A further selection (\"electron identification\") is applied to distinguish electrons from other particles with similar detector signatures, e. g. charged pions. At the LHC the electron identification is typically based on information on the shapes of energy clusters in the calorimeter, assisted by tracking information. To achieve optimal separation, this information is often processed in multivariate methods, which will be introduced in Section 3.4.2. The energy scale of electrons is typically calibrated against the invariant mass of well-known SM particles, such as the quarkonia J/\u03c8 and \u03a5, and the Z boson.",

Jets containing b hadrons (\"b-jets\") can be identified by dedicated b-tagging algorithms. These algorithms are based on the distinctive properties of b hadrons such as their long lifetime of the order of picoseconds, their high mass of the order of 5 GeV, or their semileptonic decays B \u2192 \u03bd X. Experimental signatures related to the long lifetimes include secondary vertices with large displacement from the primary collision vertex or charged-particle tracks with large impact parameters relative to the primary vertex. The high mass of b hadrons results in \"broader\" jets compared to jets from light quarks and high relative p T of the lepton in semileptonic decays. The lepton from B \u2192 \u03bd X is typically non-isolated and carries rather low absolute p T (\"soft lepton\"). In addition the fragmentation of b quarks is said to be \"hard\": the b hadron carries a large fraction of the b-quark energy. Recent b-tagging algorithms at hadron colliders combine the available information on jets with b hadrons in a single multivariate classifier. The performance of a b-tagging algorithm can be quantified by the probability to correctly identify a jet coming from a b quark as a b-jet and by the probability to wrongly identify a jet from a light-flavor quark or a gluon (\"mistag\"). A b-tagging classifier can either be used by assigning b-tags to all jets that show classifier values above standardized working points with a fixed mistag probability or by exploiting the full shape of the classifier's distribution. As the b-tagging and mistag efficiency may be different in data and simulated data, b-tagging algorithms must be calibrated, such that the simulation can be corrected with scale factors. Datasets enriched with tt events are well suited for such a calibration, as they contain two jets with b hadrons from the tt decay, see also Section 6.5.",

The main classes of jet-substructure algorithms are jet-declustering algorithms and jet-shape algorithms. The key idea of declustering algorithms is to undo the last steps of the jet clustering algorithm to identify those structures in the jet related to the decay of the mother particle. Grooming techniques such as pruning or trimming remove soft radiation uncorrelated to the decay particles. This results in better resolution for the jet mass and reduced pile-up 13 dependence. Jet shape algorithms such as n-subjettiness [125] assign a probability to a fat jet to stem from n overlapping jets. Combinations of several techniques can also be used. The exact choice of algorithm depends on the expected event topologies and typical momentum range of the boosted objects. Reviews of jet-substructure algorithms can be found e. g. in [126,127,128].",

More precise cross section results can be obtained by exploiting the kinematic properties of the final state particles. The shapes of kinematic distributions are determined for the signal and all background processes and stored in discretized form in template histograms. The sum of template histograms for the signal and background processes is then fitted to the data using maximum-likelihood (ML) methods as described in Section 3.4.1. Fitting kinematic distributions in signal-enriched and background-enriched regions simultaneously allows for better constraints on the background level, resulting in reduced statistical uncertainty of the result. At the same time additional systematic uncertainties arise due to the limited knowledge of the shapes of kinematic distributions. In more sophisticated fitting procedures, also the shapes of kinematic distributions are allowed to vary within their uncertainties. The top-quark production cross section and its uncertainties may then be determined either from a multiparameter profile likelihood ratio fit, or the uncertainties are estimated using pseudo-experiments.",

While the detection efficiency can be calibrated using data to high accuracy (see Section 3.2), a determination of the detector acceptance, i. e. the ratio of detectable events to all events, requires an (often large) extrapolation to the full phase space of the tt final state. The extrapolation is usually performed using simulated data samples and hence depends on the MC model on which the simulation is based. This model dependence can be reduced by measuring the cross section in a restricted (\"fiducial\") region of the phase space that closely resembles the detector acceptance. Typical phase space requirements include the detector's pseudorapidity range and a minimum transverse momentum of analysis objects. The fiducial phase space is usually defined in the MC simulation on the particle level, after the particles hadronize but before they decay.

            "text": "Tevatron Results. The limited size of the tt data samples at the Tevatron only allowed for a small number of differential cross section measurements. CDF published the differential tt cross section as a function of the invariant tt mass [179], which can also be interpreted as a search for exotic particles decaying into tt. D0 published a comprehensive set of differential cross sections using the full Tevatron Run II dataset [180], see Fig. 6  190]. A small selection of the vast body of results is presented in Figs. 6 and 7, including both particle and parton level observables. After unfolding, these results are compared with the predictions of MC generators at particle and parton level, and SM predictions at parton level. Generally current MC event generators as those introduced in Section 2.3 describe the differential cross sections well over a wide kinematic range. In CMS, the measured p T spectrum of top quarks was found to be softer than most MC predictions, while ATLAS results are consistent with the predictions. The recent full NNLO calculation of the top-quark p T spectrum shows improved agreement with the measured spectrum, compared to previous calculations. Recently, due to the large tt data samples at the LHC, also the first double differential cross sections were published, for example as a function of p T and y of the top quark [191]. To study the production of top quarks with large transverse momenta, differential cross section measurements using boosted-top reconstruction techniques (see Section 3.3.3) have been devised [192,187,193,194,169]. A first differential tt cross section measurement as a function of the mass of boosted top quarks has been performed as a proof of principle to measure m t in boosted-top final states [195].",

Of particular interest for rare SM processes such as associated ttH production (with the decay H \u2192 bb) as well as for the search for BSM physics is the production of tt pairs with additional b-jets. In measurements of these processes, the ratio of cross sections for tt production with two additional b-jets and ttjj production, where j is a jet of any flavor, has been used as a robust observable sensitive to tt bb production [203,204,205].",

Measuring these processes gives access to the coupling of the top quark to the  Electroweak Gauge Bosons. Evidence for tt\u03b3 production was first reported by CDF [208]. The process was first observed by ATLAS [209] in the experiment's full dataset recorded at \u221a s = 7 TeV and also measured by CMS in \u221a s = 8 TeV data [210]. The production cross section, defined in a fiducial region of phase space, is compatible with the SM prediction at NLO. The challenge of these analyses lies in separating photons from tt\u03b3 production from hadron decays into photon pairs and hadrons and electrons misidentified as photons, which is done by studying the photon isolation.",

The LHC experiments have seen evidence of these processes in leptonic decays of the W and Z bosons in combination with single-lepton and dilepton decays of the tt pair, in events containing multiple jets, b-tagged jets and two to four charged leptons [211,212,213,214,215]. While the backgrounds in these events are generally low, it is difficult to estimate the number of analysis objects wrongly identified as leptons (\"fake leptons\") precisely. The fake lepton background is usually modeled from data events in control regions, as described in Section 3.2.3. The measurements are compatible with SM predictions and are used to constrain BSM physics contributions to the Ztt coupling [212].",

In particular in the H \u2192 bb decay channel, the background from tt bb production is large and hard to control. With sophisticated multivariate methods, both physics motivated (matrix-element method, see Section 3.4.3) and from machine learning, and the inclusion of final states with boosted top quarks, so far only upper limits on the production cross section have been determined.

The characteristic t-channel signature of a semileptonically decaying top quark and a spectator jet in forward direction is overwhelmed by background mainly from W +jets production. This requires sophisticated multivariate techniques to separate signal and background and profile likelihood ratio fits to extract the production cross section. Both CDF and D0 have published single top-quark production measurements using the above techniques with their full Run-II datasets [234,235] as well as a combination [236], shown in Fig. 8 (left). The s-channel, which has a smaller production cross section and larger backgrounds compared to the t-channel, was only established as a separate single top-quark production channel by combining the full CDF and D0 Run-II datasets [237]. The combined Tevatron results are in good agreement with SM predictions at approximate NNLO [115,114].",

While the top quark is produced with an up-type quark (or down-type antiquark) in the initial state, the top antiquark is produced with a down-type quark (or up-type antiquark). Hence R t-ch is sensitive to the ratio of PDFs for up-type and down-type quarks (and down-type and up-type antiquarks), with a naive expectation of R t-ch = 2 for up and down valence quarks only. Also anomalous W tb couplings as expected from BSM physics would modify R t-ch . Experimentally R t-ch is a robust observable in which many uncertainties cancel. Measurements of R t-ch from LHC Run 1 [239,240] and Run 2 [242] are compatible with the SM prediction, see Fig. 8   [22,24] and .

At hadron colliders the conventional way of measuring m t relies on the kinematic reconstruction of the tt final state. Kinematic reconstruction is the most precise method to determine m t to date, with innovations including the matrix-element method (MEM) and in-situ calibration of the jet energy scale to increase the m t sensitivity, see Section 1.2. The different tt decay channels and different observables sensitive to m t are subject to different systematic uncertainties.

Alternatively, each event can be assigned an m t -dependent likelihood. This event-level likelihood is composed of process-level likelihoods that included the hardscattering matrix elements of the signal and the most important background processes (MEM, see Section 3.4.3 [52,53]). The ideogram method [259,260] represents an alternative to the MEM that is less computing-intensive. In the ideogram method the likelihood for each process is assumed to factorize into an m t -independent factor depending only on the event topology and an m t -dependent factor depending on the event kinematics.",

            "text": "In-Situ Jet Energy Scale Calibration. A major limitation on the precision of kinematic methods is the limited resolution of m t when reconstructed (partly) from jet energies. In addition, a miscalibrated jet-energy scale would lead to shifts in the reconstructed m t similar to shifts caused by a different m t value. This correlation between m t and the JES can be exploited by reconstructing hadronic decays of other particles with known mass in the same dataset. Hadronically decaying W bosons, available in single-lepton and all-hadronic tt events, are the particles of choice: by reconstructing m t and m W simultaneously and constraining m W to the known value the precision of m t is significantly improved [261]. This method of calibrating the JES in-situ can be applied to template, MEM, and ideogram methods alike. Strictly speaking the in-situ JES calibration is only applicable to the same composition of light-flavor quark jets the W boson decays to. On the other hand, the b-jets from top-quark decays fragment differently from lightflavor jets and could need a separate calibration (\"b-JES\"). This is either dealt with by assigning a systematic uncertainty to the residual difference between b-jets and light-flavor jets or by determining both JES and b-JES in situ.",

            "text": "Tevatron and LHC Results. The most precise measurements of the top-quark mass currently available from the Tevatron and LHC experiments are summarized in Table 2. The CDF result [262] is obtained using a template method, while D0 utilizes a MEM [54,55]. The CMS result-the single most precise m t measurement to date-employs the ideogram method [263]. All measurements presented above were performed in the single-lepton channel and used an in-situ calibration of the JES scale. The most precise ATLAS result [264] is based on a template method in the dilepton channel. While kinematic m t measurements in other tt decay channels are less precise, they still provide valuable cross-checks, as they are subject to different systematic uncertainties and may be influenced by BSM physics differently. The Tevatron experiments have provided a full suite of further measurements, mostly with the full Run-II dataset, in the single-lepton channel [54], the dilepton channel [265,266,267], for fully hadronic tt decays [268], and for events with jets and missing transverse momentum [269]. With the large LHC datasets and better understanding of systematic effects, also the precision of m t measurements in these channels is improving, as seen from the LHC results in the single and dilepton channel [270,271,272,263] and the fully hadronic channel [273,274,275,263].

In a method known as the \"L xy method\" 21 -pioneered at CDF-the correlation of m t and the b hadron decay length is exploited [277,278]. The decay length is determined from track information only, and the main systematic uncertainties of the method originate from the MC modeling of the track multiplicity in b hadron decays. Another measure of m t exploited in [278] is the transverse momentum of the charged lepton (e or \u00b5) from the leptonic decay of a W boson coming from the top quark. The combination of both leads to a 4% uncertainty on m t , which is dominated by the limited size of the CDF Run-II dataset. The L xy method has also been applied to the CMS dataset at \u221a s = 8 TeV in a preliminary study [279], achieving a precision of Invariant Mass of Final-State Particle Combinations. Another mass-dependent kinematic observable used to determine m t that is based only on the momenta of charged particles is the invariant mass of the charged lepton from a leptonic W boson decay and the secondary vertex of a b hadron decay, both from a top-quark decay. In a CMS measurement, a precision of 0.9% has been achieved [282]. With the large LHC datasets also a more exclusive tt decay is accessible, in which the b hadron decays according to B \u2192 J/\u03c8 + X \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 + X. As a proxy for m t , the invariant mass of the charged lepton from a leptonic W boson decay and the J/\u03c8 is employed [283]. A first result using this technique has been published recently based on the full CMS dataset at \u221a s = 8 TeV [284]. The precision of the result is 1.8%, limited by the available statistics.",

In a given renormalization scheme, e. g. the on-shell scheme or the MS scheme, the m t parameter in the tt cross section is defined unambiguously. The measured inclusive cross section also has a weak dependence on the m t parameter used in the MC simulation: Because of the larger momenta transferred to the tt decay products with larger m t , the acceptance for tt events increases slightly with m t , hence the measured cross section decreases, see Eq. (20). The top-quark mass can be determined from the intersection of the curves describing the m t dependence of the theoretical and the measured cross section, as illustrated in Fig. 12. This method has been pioneered by D0 [294] and has been applied both at the Tevatron and at the LHC. The results have reached a precision on the lihood functions from the two calculations. The cross section measurement is represented by a Gaussian likelihood function centered on the measured value with rms equal to the total experimental uncertainty. We multiply the theory and measurement likelihoods to obtain a joint likelihood. The contour in Fig. 3 shows the smallest region of the joint likelihood that contains 68% of its integral. We integrate over the cross section to get a likelihood function that depends only on the top-quark mass and find m t 170 7 GeV at 68% C.L., in agreement with the world average of direct measurements of the top-quark mass of 172:6 1:4 GeV [20].",

There is a wide range of topquark properties to be tested: Basic properties include the electric charge, the mass (already discussed in Chapter 5), and the decay width of the top quark.

(26) have been performed both at the Tevatron [309] and at the LHC [310]. The more precise LHC result is based on a profile likelihood ratio fit to the b-jet multiplicity in tt dilepton final states. The fits leaves \u0393 t as a free parameter and treats the b-tagging and mistagging efficiencies as well as the uncertainties of \u03c3 t-ch and \u03c3 SM t-ch as nuisance parameters.

The width of the top-quark can also be determined directly from the kinematic reconstruction of its decay products, as performed by CDF [311] and CMS [312]. Similar to measurements of m t , an observable sensitive to the top-quark width is built from reconstructed quantities. In the more recent CMS analysis, the observable is the invariant mass of charged lepton-b-jet pairs in dilepton tt events. In a series of binary hypothesis tests the SM value of \u0393 t is probed against different non-SM width hypotheses to extract a 95% CL central confidence interval of 0.6 GeV < \u0393 t < 2.4 GeV [312].

Additional small asymmetries arise from electroweak corrections [313]. The observation of large tt production asymmetries would be a sign of BSM physics. The different initial states (pp vs. pp) and the different fractions of gg-initiated and qq-initiated tt production at the Tevatron and the LHC lead to different asymmetry observables, the forwardbackward asymmetry A FB at the Tevatron and the charge asymmetry A C at the LHC, as defined below. Fig. 13 shows that BSM physics contributions would influence A FB and A C simultaneously but in different ways depending on the model.",

The kinematics of the top quark and antiquark are measured and then corrected back to the parton level using unfolding techniques. The uncertainties on A FB are dominated by the limited size of the Tevatron datasets. The largest systematic uncertainties originate from the background estimation and the MC modeling of hadronization. Early measurements of A FB at the Tevatron showed discrepancies to NLO QCD preditions, in particular in events with large tt invariant masses [61]. However, the CDF and D0 results with the full Run-II dataset [315,316,317,318] and the most recent SM predictions with QCD corrections up to NNLO [319] or approximate N 3 LO [320], both with NLO electroweak corrections, are compatible within less than 1.5 standard deviations, as shown in Table 4. Also the differential A FB measurements show agreement with the SM prediction at the level of two standard deviations or better [316,321].",

Using the first 2.7 fb \u22121 to 5.4 fb \u22121 of Tevatron Run II data, the W -boson polarization has been measured using the matrix-element method (MEM) and template-fit techniques. In the CDF MEM analysis, a likelihood ratio discriminant is constructed from the LO tt production matrix element parameterized as a function of the W -boson polarization fractions [338]. In the D0 template-fit analysis, independent templates for the three polarization states as a function of the reconstructed cos \u03b8 * distribution are constructed from simulated data and fitted to the data [339]. The results of these measurements have been combined [340]   [342]. ATLAS has determined the W -boson polarization from a template fit and additionally from a complementary set of observables that is based on asymmetries in cos \u03b8 * [343]. An example of cos \u03b8 * templates is shown in Fig. 15 (left). The dominant systematic uncertainties on these measurements are due to the modeling of the tt signal and the determination of the dominant W +jets background, which is a source of unpolarized W bosons. Based on the above individual ATLAS and CMS measurements, a combination was performed in the context of the LHCtopWG [344]. The relative uncertainties on F L and F 0 obtained in the combination are around 10%. Improved measurements have been presented using the \u221a s = 8 TeV dataset: the uncertainties on F L and F 0 were further reduced to below 5% [345].",

Comparisons ata and MC simulation in control regions are used to the rates to the expected signal region composition. fake lepton yield is then estimated by weighting each t in a sample containing one or two loosely identified ons. he contributions from other electroweak background esses with two real leptons, such as single top, , WW, ZZ, and WZ production are determined MC simulations normalized to the theoretical predics. The expected numbers of signal and background ts are compared to data in Table I. The number of rved events in each channel is: 477 for the e \u00fe e \u00c0 nel, 906 for the \u00fe \u00c0 channel, and 2930 for the \u00c7 channel, which dominates the total yield due to looser selection criteria.",

The spin correlations can be extracted either from a template fit to the reconstructed data or from the unfolded distribution. The hypotheses of fully correlated spins and uncorrelated spins are then tested against each other in a hypothesis test. The first spin correlation measurements have been presented at the Tevatron [356,357,358]; however, with significances for correlated spins below five standard deviations. The first observation of tt spin correlations with more than five standard deviations was reported by ATLAS [349], illustrated in Fig. 15   [362] with similar analysis strategies followed. A different approach is taken in [363], where the single-lepton tt decay channel is considered instead of the dilepton channel. A hypothesis test is constructed from a likelihood ratio test statistic, for which the LO tt matrix elements with and without spin correlations are compared. The data do not show a clear preference for either hypotheses, and from a template fit to the test statistic, the fraction of tt pairs with correlated spins is determined. Spin correlations have also been observed with more than five standard deviations significance in a recent top-quark polarization measurement [348].",

The most general W tb coupling contains CP-conserving as well as CP-violating contributions. Processes that change a quark's flavor without changing its charge, known as flavor-changing neutral current (FCNC) interactions, are forbidden in the SM at tree level and heavily suppressed at the level of quantum corrections. Strong enhancement of FCNC interactions in top-quark production or decay would be a clear sign of BSM physics. Due to the special role the top quark is expected to play in many BSM physics models, it is plausible to assume that hypothetical new particles with masses at the TeV scale have significant couplings to the top quark. Therefore top quarks are preferred decay products of heavy particles in many BSM models. The large Yukawa coupling of the top quark may also indicate a relation to dark matter (DM) that can be studied in the associated production of tt pairs with DM. In the absence of new heavy resonances accessible experimentally, the top-quark couplings may be studied in an effective field theory (EFT) approach, in which all heavy BSM particles are \"integrated out\" and their effect at energies accessible experimentally is parameterized in a comprehensive set of effective couplings.",

(32) [241,347], by measuring the differential production cross section as a function of angular variables [369], and by constructing asymmetries in various angular distributions [370,348]. Major systematic uncertainties arise from the JES calibration and the single top-quark signal modeling. When interpreting the results, it should be noted that the tightness of the constraints on the individual coupling constants depends on the assumptions on the other constants. For example, when fixing f L V = 1 and f R V = 0, the real part of f R T can be constrained to better than \u00b10.08, while the ratios of the real and imaginary part of f R T /f L V are much less constrained, of the order of 0.2 to 0.3 [369]. Within the current measurement precision, all results from LHC Run 1 agree with the SM predictions and limits on anomalous W tb couplings have been set. The sensitivity of searches for anomalous W tb couplings is expected to increase with the increased size of the data samples at 13 TeV in LHC Run 2 compared to Run 1.",

They can occur via higher-order corrections, but are strongly suppressed due to destructive interference effects in loop corrections, a variant of the GIM mechanism [26].

The decay width of a heavy resonance depends on the underlying BSM physics model, and narrow resonances lead to different experimental signatures than wide resonances. Narrow resonances feature decay widths of the order of a few percent of their mass, comparable with the detector resolution. They are often represented by a benchmark model with a \"leptophobic\" Z boson, a heavy neutral gauge boson that only shows weak couplings to leptons (or else the resonance would have been discovered in searches for Z \u2192 + \u2212 decays already). Such Z bosons occur for example in topcolor-assisted technicolor (TC2) models [401] and are often assumed to have a relative width of 1% or 1.2%. Wide resonances show a decay width of 10% of their mass or above.

The LHC experiments have published tt resonance searches in both boosted and resolved decay channels with the full dataset at \u221a s = 7 TeV [405,406,407,408,409] and \u221a s = 8 TeV [410,411].

The object reconstruction is adapted to the m tt range considered, for example with narrower fat jets and less isolated charged leptons at large m tt , well above 1 TeV. The dominant uncertainties are related to the modeling of the non-resonant tt background, the JES of fat jets, and the PDFs. As a result of the LHC searches for heavy resonances decaying into tt pairs, leptophobic Z bosons were excluded up to masses of 2.4 TeV at 95% CL. If the data are interpreted in RS2 models [412], KK gluons up to masses of 2.8 TeV can be excluded at 95% CL.

The isation of the likelihood can change the central values of the nuisance parameters eir associated uncertainties. In the region of m reco tt above 1.   prediction as seen in figure 9 is slightly higher than the data, which would lead to the anticipation that the observed limits should be slightly better than the expected ones. However, the central values of some nuisance parameters are significantly shifted in the fit. In the high-m reco tt region one of the dominant uncertainties is the high-p T jet b-tagging extrapolation uncertainty, as detailed in section 8. This uncertainty is reduced to half of its original size by the fit, and the central value is also shifted downwards by approximately one pre-fit standard deviation. As this uncertainty is associated with reconstructed physics objects, it has correlated effects on the predictions of BSM signal and SM background. The 1\u03c3 change in the central value of this nuisance parameter reduces the acceptance of high-mass signals in the boosted selection considerably: approximately 25% for a Z \u2032 with a mass of 2 TeV.

A charged heavy gauge boson (W ) features a different set of decay channels than a Z boson, e. g. with decays into tb (tb and tb). In contrast to the SM W bosons, arbitrary combinations of lefthanded and right-handed couplings to fermions are allowed for W bosons. For example, in a CDF search [417] neural networks are trained to separate a hypothetical W -boson signal from background due to QCD, W/Z+jets and tt processes. The data are fitted to a combined neural-network discriminant to extract a limit on the W -boson mass. The uncertainties are dominated by the limited knowledge of W and Z boson production in association with heavy-flavor jets. In a scenario with purely right-handed W couplings the Tevatron experiments have excluded W masses up to 885 GeV [418,417].",

With the large center-of-mass energy available at LHC Run 2, a simpler approach was sufficient to supersede the Run-1 limits, a search for bumps in the invariant mass spectrum of the tb system, as reconstructed from a charged lepton, jets and missing transverse momentum (MET). No deviation from the SM prediction was observed and a 95%-CL limit of 2.38 TeV was derived [422].",

Heavier quarks with the same chiral couplings as the six SM quarks (\"fourth-generation quarks\") have been searched for at the Tevatron [423,424,425,426,427]. However, a fourth quark generation has been excluded by the fact that Higgs boson production and decay rates are compatible with the SM prediction [428] 25 . An attractive alternative are vector-like quarks (VLQs), colored fermions that have left-right symmetric couplings and do not have Yukawa couplings to acquire their mass, see [429] for a recent theory review. As an example searches for vector-like heavy T quarks with charge Q = 2/3 will be discussed below. Vector-like T quarks mix with the SM top quark and decay into Ht, Zt, and W b final states. Other VLQs considered at the LHC are heavy B quarks with charge Q = \u22121/3, and heavy X quarks (Q = 5/3) and Y quarks (Q = \u22124/3).",

The LHC experiments have conducted searches for VLQs with Run-1 and in Run-2 data and in various final states. The searches in T T production [430,431,432,433,434,435,436,437,438,439,440,441] generally aim at reconstructing an invariant mass spectrum sensitive to resonances due to VLQs. For low invariant masses regular resolved jets are used in the reconstruction, while for high invariant masses, boosted-jet techniques are employed that also allow for b-tagging in the dense environment of fat jets. No signs of significant resonance peaks were observed and lower lim- its on the T -quark mass m T were derived, for example m T > 1.10 TeV at 95% CL assuming B(T \u2192 Zt) = 1.0 [435] 26 . In single T quark production, stronger exclusion limits can be obtained [442,443,444,445,446,447], but these limits rely on assumptions on the W T b coupling. Searches for heavy B, X, and Y quarks have also been conducted at the LHC, see e. g. [434,441].",

DM searches at colliders have the distinct advantage that their interpretation is independent of astrophysical input. Classic DM searches require at least a single detectable SM object recoiling against the undetected DM particles; the most well-known signature is a single high-p T jet (\"monojet\") in association with a significant amount of MET. Events with a tt pair or a single top quark and large MET (tt + E miss T , t + E miss T ) are also among the attractive signatures studied in the quest for DM at colliders. DM searches at the LHC have been interpreted first in EFT-based models [451,452] and limits on the DM-nucleon cross section as a function of the DM mass were derived. As a consequence of a coordinated effort between the LHC experiments for Run 2 (\"Dark Matter Forum\"), the focus shifted to simplified models with defined benchmark points [453].",

The study shows that kinematic methods to determine m t will continue to be the most precise, with rather optimistic uncertainty estimates below 200 MeV, or 0.12%, using the full HL-LHC dataset. Methods based A potential reduction of the trigger efficiency of up to a factor 3 as well as many improvements in the understanding of the systematic uncertainties are expected. With data collected during the Run I, most analyses are already limited by systematic uncertainties except for the J/y method which is still affected by a sizeable statistical uncertainty. With 3 ab 1 of data, all analyses will be limited by systematic uncertainties, and especially by theoretical modeling uncertainties. Conventional methods, which are the most precise ones, are expected to yield an ultimate relative precision below 0.1%. on the reconstruction of exclusive final states, e. g.

With more and more sophisticated analysis methods, the top quark properties are remarkably well understood. In addition, the top-quark is considered a possible stepping stone to physics beyond the SM, both as part of a signal and as a major background. All SM measurements and searches for BSM physics so far are compatible with the expectations of the SM and contribute significantly to constraining possible BSM physics models.

A potential reduction of the trigger efficiency of up to a factor 3 as well as many improvements in the understanding of the systematic uncertainties are expected.
