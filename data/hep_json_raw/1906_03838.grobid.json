The analysis is based on data with an integrated luminosity of 15.1 pb \u22121 accumulated in the center-of-mass energy range 1.2-1.4 GeV. Two e + e \u2212 \u2192 f 1 (1285) candidate events are found at the peak of the resonance and zero events beyond the resonance. The significance of the e + e \u2212 \u2192 f 1 (1285) signal is 2.5\u03c3. The cross section at the maximum of the resonance is found to be \u03c3(e + e \u2212 \u2192 f 1 ) = 45 +33 \u221224 pb. The corresponding branching fraction B(f 1 (1285) \u2192 e + e \u2212 ) = (5.1 +3.7   \u22122.7 ) \u00d7 10 \u22129 . We consider this result as a first indication of the process e + e \u2212 \u2192 f 1 (1285). The measured branching fraction is consistent with the theoretical prediction.",

            "text": "The dominant mechanism of hadron production in e + e \u2212 collisions is single-photon annihilation. Annihilation through two photons is suppressed by a factor of \u03b1 2 , where \u03b1 is the fine structure constant. The only observed process of the two-photon annihilation into hadrons in e + e \u2212 collisions is the production of two vector mesons, \u03c1 0 \u03c1 0 and \u03c1 0 \u03c6, in the BABAR experiment [1]. Experiments on the search for production of a single C-even resonance began more than 30 years ago at the VEPP-2M e + e \u2212 collider with the ND detector [2]. In these experiments, the first upper limits were set on the probabilities of the inverse reactions, namely the decays \u03b7 , f 0 (975), f 2 (1270), f 0 (1300), a 0 (980), and a 2 (1320) to e + e \u2212 pairs. In recent experiments at the colliders VEPP-2M [2,3], VEPP-2000 [4,5] and BEPCII [6], this inverse-reaction technique was used to set the best upper limits on the electron widths of the resonances listed above, as well as \u03b7 and X(3872). In this paper, we present the first search for the process e + e \u2212 \u2192 f 1 (1285) shown in the diagram in Fig. 1. There are also no data on the f 1 (1285) \u2192 e + e \u2212 decay. Axial-vector resonances, like the f 1 (1285), do not decay into two photons, but may nevertheless be produced in e + e \u2212 annihilation, through virtual photons. Theoretically, the f 1 (1285) \u2192 e + e \u2212 decay, as well as the e + e \u2212 \u2192 f 1 (1285) process, are discussed in Ref. [7,8] within the framework of the vector-meson-dominance model assuming that the virtual photons in Fig. 1 are coupled with the f 1 meson via intermediate \u03c1 0 mesons. The two coupling constants describing the \u03b3 * \u03b3 * \u2192 f 1 (1285) amplitude and the relative phase between them are determined from the experimental data on the f 1 (1285) \u2192 \u03c1\u03b3 decay [9,10] and the \u03b3\u03b3 * \u2192 f 1 (1285) reaction [11]. The e + e \u2212 \u2192 f 1 (1285) cross section is predicted to be (31 \u00b1 16) pb. The corresponding f 1 (1285) \u2192 e + e \u2212 branching fraction calculated using the formula \u03c3(e + e \u2212 \u2192 f 1 ) = (12\u03c0/m 2 f 1 )B(f 1 \u2192 e + e \u2212 ) is (3.5\u00b11.8)\u00d710 \u22129 . The f 1 -meson mass and width are 1281.9 \u00b1 0.5 MeV and 22.7 \u00b1 1.1 MeV [10], respectively. Its main decay modes are \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 , \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , \u03b7\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , and \u03b7\u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 [10]. The first three of these final states are also produced in the single-photon annihilation and have cross sections at \u221a s = m f 1 by two to three orders of magnitude higher than the prediction for \u03c3(e + e \u2212 \u2192 f 1 ). Therefore, the most viable mode for searching for the process e + e \u2212 \u2192 f 1 (1285) is f 1 \u2192 \u03b7\u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 with the branching fraction (17.3 \u00b1 0.7)%.",

The data set at the maximum of the f 1 resonance \u221a s = 1.282 GeV with an integral luminosity of 3.4 pb \u22121 was collected in 2017 specifically for this analysis. For 2010-2012 energy scans the collider energy was controlled with an accuracy of 2-4 MeV. In 2017 the beam energy was monitored with an accuracy of about 80 keV by the backscattering-laser-light system [14]. The center-of-mass energy spread at \u221a s = 1.282 GeV is 630 keV. A detailed description of the SND detector can be found in Refs. [15]. This is a nonmagnetic detector, the main part of which is a three-layer spherical electromagnetic calorimeter based on NaI (Tl) crystals. The calorimeter covers about 95% of the solid angle and has an energy resolution for photons of \u03c3 E /E = 4.2%/ 4 E(GeV), and an angular resolution of 1.5 \u2022 . The directions of charged particles are measured in a tracking system consisting of a ninelayer drift chamber and a proportional chamber with cathode-strip readout. The solid angle covered by the tracking system is 94% of 4\u03c0. The calorimeter is surrounded by a muon system.",

The Born cross sections needed for simulation of background processes are taken from existing data. For main background processes e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c9\u03c0 0 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 \u03b3, e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c9\u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 \u2192 3\u03c0 0 \u03b3, e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b7\u03b3 \u2192 3\u03c0 0 \u03b3 the recent most accurate cross section measurements [16,19,20,21,22] are used. Other processes with multiphoton final states, e.g. e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c9\u03b7, e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c6\u03b7, and e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c9\u03b7\u03c0 0 , have small cross sections in the energy range of interest and give negligible contributions to the background. The processes with K L mesons, e + e \u2212 \u2192 K S K L , e + e \u2212 \u2192 K S K L \u03c0 0 , etc, are strongly suppressed by our selection criteria (see Sec. 3) and are also negligible.",

To suppress this background, the requirement of the absence of a \u03c9-meson candidate in an event is used. The \u03c9 candidate is defined as a combination of three photons, one of which is the most energetic photon in the event, and the other two must have an invariant mass in the range |M 2\u03b3 \u2212 m \u03c0 0 | < 35 MeV.

The next three conditions in Table 1 suppress background by a factor of about 80. For the main background process e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c9\u03c0 0 (\u03b3), these conditions remove well reconstructed events with five true photons and a spurious photon from the beam background, and six-photon events with an extra photon emitted from the initial state. Small remaining background contains improperly reconstructed events, for example, with a splitting photon from the \u03c9 decay, which fraction may be simulated incorrectly. To estimate quality of simulation of the background-suppression conditions, we study a sample of background events with \u03c7 2 \u03b7\u03c0\u03c0 > 35, which are well reconstructed in the e + e \u2212 \u2192 6\u03b3 hypothesis (\u03c7 2 6\u03b3 < 30). The number of such events selected in data (465) is in reasonable agreement with the number expected from simulation (422 \u00b1 2). The selection criteria listed in the three last rows in Table 1 reduce the number of data events by a factor of 18.6 \u00b1 3.6 and the number of simulated background events by a factor of 20.2 \u00b1 0.3. From the simulation-to-data ratio 1.08 \u00b1 0.21, we estimate that the MC simulation reproduces the effect of the background suppression conditions with a systematic uncertainty of about 20%. Taking into account 10% uncertainty due to the \u03c7 2 \u03b7\u03c0\u03c0 < 35 condition discussed above, we conclude that the systematic uncertainty of the background prediction for the selection criteria listed in Table 1 is better than 30%.",
