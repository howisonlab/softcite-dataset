The jet energy scale is measured in events where the jet recoils against a reference object, which can be either a calibrated photon, a reconstructed Z boson, or a system of well-measured small-radius jets. The jet energy resolution and a calibration of forward jets are derived using dijet balance measurements. The jet mass response is measured with two methods: using mass peaks formed by W bosons and top quarks with large transverse momenta and by comparing the jet mass measured using the energy deposited in the calorimeter with that using the momenta of charged-particle tracks. The transverse momentum and mass responses in simulations are found to be about 2-3% higher than in data. This difference is adjusted for with a correction factor. The results of the different methods are combined to yield a calibration over a large range of transverse momenta ( p T ). The precision of the relative jet energy scale is 1-2% for 200 GeV < p T < 2 TeV, while that of the mass scale is 2-10%. The ratio of the energy resolutions in data and simulation is measured to a precision of 10-15% over the same p T range.",

These particles most often decay hadronically. Due to their large transverse momentum, the decay products become collimated and may be reconstructed as a single jet with large radius parameter R [1,2] (a 'large-R' jet). The sensitivity of searches and measurements that use large-R jets depends on an accurate knowledge of the transverse momentum p T and mass m responses of the detector [3]. A calibration of the e-mail: atlas.publications@cern.ch large-R energy and mass scales derived using Monte Carlo simulation yields uncertainties as large as 10%. The calibration described in this paper results in a reduction of these uncertainties by more than a factor of three.",

The in situ calibration is determined in two separate steps. In the first step, the JES is measured with the same methods used to calibrate small-R jets [9]. These techniques rely on the transverse momentum balance in a variety of final states, illustrated in Fig. 2. The JES correction factor is a product of two terms. The absolute calibration is derived from a statis-tical combination of three measurements from Z +jet, \u03b3 +jet, and multijet events in the central region of the detector. A relative intercalibration, derived using dijet events, propagates the well-measured central JES into the forward region of the detector. The in situ calibration accounts for detector effects which are not captured by simulation. The JES correction is applied as a four-momentum scale factor to jets in data; therefore, it also affects the jet mass calibration.",

An iron/scintillator tile calorimeter measures the energy of hadrons in the central rapidity range, |\u03b7| < 1.7, and a liquid-argon hadronic endcap calorimeter provides coverage for 1.5 < |\u03b7| < 3.2.

These samples were generated with the A14 set of tuned parameters [19] and the NNPDF2.3 LO parton distribution function (PDF) set [20]. Samples generated with Herwig 7 [21] and Sherpa v2.1 [22] were used for comparison. The Herwig 7 sample used the UE-EE-5 set of tuned parameters [23] and CTEQ6L1 PDF set [24].

The large-R jets used in this paper are reconstructed using topological clusters that are calibrated to correct for response differences between energy deposition from electromagnetic particles (electrons and photons) and hadrons with the LCW scheme of Ref. [5]. Small-R jets reconstructed from \"electromagnetic scale\" topo-clusters are used as a reference system in the multijet balance method of Sect. 5.4. Results are labelled with \"LCW\" or \"EM\" to indicate the calibration of the clusters. Topological clusters are defined to be massless. The fourmomenta of these topo-clusters, initially defined as pointing to the geometrical centre of the ATLAS detector, are adjusted to point towards the hard-scatter primary vertex of the event, which is defined as the primary vertex with the largest associated sum of track p 2 T . To reduce the effects of pile-up, soft emissions, and the underlying event on jet substructure measurement, the trimming algorithm is applied to the jets. Trimming reclusters the jet constituents of each R = 1.0 jet using the k t algorithm [39] and R sub = 0.2, producing a collection of subjets for each jet. Subjets with p subjet T / p jet T < 0.05 are removed, and the jet four-momentum is recalculated from the remaining constituents.",

These results are used to define the jet-level mass correction applied in the simulation calibration dure as for the jet energy calibration.

The mass response is presented in Fig. 3 for three representative values of the truth jet mass: 40 GeV in panel (b), the W boson mass in panel (c), and the top quark mass in panel (d). The mass response is close to unity for jets with p T between 200 and 800 GeV and as large as 1.5 for very energetic jets with relatively low mass. Several effects can impact the jet mass response. The reconstructed mass can be artificially increased by the splitting of topo-clusters during their creation. This effect is particularly important for jets with small particle-level mass relative to their p T (m/ p T 0.05). Similarly, when several particles form one topo-cluster, or when particles fail to produce any topo-cluster, the mass response is decreased.

The average value of the ratio is taken to be the mean value of a Gaussian fit.  Table 4. For small-R jets with p T < 60 GeV within |\u03b7| < 2.4, the JVT selection is applied to suppress pile-up jets. The large-R probe jet is required to have |\u03b7 det | < 0.8, while the small-R jets that constitute the recoil system are required to have |\u03b7 det | < 2.8 and p T > 25 GeV. To select events with multijet recoil systems, the leading jet in the recoil system (j 1 ) is allowed to have no more than 80% of the total transverse momentum of the recoil system. This selection ensures that the recoil system consists of several jets with lower p T than the large-R jet, which are each well-calibrated by small-R jet in situ techniques [9]. The angle \u03b1 in the azimuthal plane between the leading large-R jet and the vector defining the recoil system is required to satisfy |\u03b1 \u2212 \u03c0 | < 0.3. The R distance \u03b2 between the leading large-R jet and the nearest small-R jet from the recoil system is required to be greater than 1.5. The simulation calibration and \u03b7-intercalibration described in Sects. 4 and 5.1 are applied to the large-R jets studied using this technique. Figure 12 shows the distribution of R MJB as a function of the large-R jet p T . The balance in data decreases from approximately 1.01 at p T = 300 GeV to about 0.99 for jets with p T = 2 TeV. The simulation shows a similar downward trend. The response in simulations is 2% higher than in data, consistent with the findings of the other methods where they overlap.  The total uncertainty in the R MJB measurement is approximately \u00b1 2% or lower for p T < 2 TeV. The uncertainty in the energy scale of the jets of the recoil in situ procedure is propagated through the large-R MJB procedure. Uncertainties associated with highp T jets in the recoil system which lie beyond the region covered by the R = 0.4 in situ analyses are derived from measurements of the calorimeter response to isolated single charged particles, which are also propagated through this large-R jet analysis to provide coverage at the highest values of jet p T (> 1 TeV) [65]. No assumption is made about the flavour of the recoil jets (originating from a gluon, a light quark, or a heavy-flavour quark). This lack of knowledge is a source of systematic uncertainty. The uncertainty in the multijet-balance observable due to the jet flavour response is evaluated using a correlated propagation of the small-R jet flavour response uncertainties, i.e. all jets are shifted simultaneously.",

Therefore, a comparison of the double ratio of R trk in simulations and data provides a way to validate the modelling of large-R jet properties in situ. The ratio of R trk values determined in data and simulations should be equal to unity for well-modelled observables. Any deviation from this expectation can be taken as a scale uncertainty in the measurement. This method is versatile and allows the determination of uncertainties for several variables, such as the p T , mass, and substructure information of large-R jets. Moreover, the dijets process provides a very large sample, such that the analysis can be performed in a large number of p T and mass or m/ p T regions. Figure 14 shows R trk as a function of the large-R jet p T in dijet events for data and several simulation samples. The maximum spread between the two generators and three tracking variations that assume three different types of mismodelling (resolution [66], efficiency within dense environments [67], and alignment [68]) is about 8%. A steady increase in the calorimeter-to-track jet response R trk with increasing large-R jet p T is observed, going well beyond the expected ratio of the total and charged transverse momenta of a jet, caused by inefficiencies in the tracker response at high jet p T . Figure 15 shows a breakdown of the uncertainties in the large-R jet p T derived from this method for the transverse momentum for large-R jets with values of m/ p T \u2248 0.2. The main source of uncertainty across the entire p T range originates from differences between data and the nominal Monte Carlo generator considered in this study. As this uncertainty was expected to be large, the R trk method is neither included in the in situ JES combination nor used as a source of systematic uncertainty for the JES of large-R jets. Rather, the R trk p T results are used as an independent cross-check to validate the JES calibration techniques.   [GeV]  The same method is also applied to the large-R jet calorimeter mass, and is shown in Fig. 16. The largest difference between the considered generators is \u223c 2 to 3%. Figure 17 shows the various uncertainties in the large-R jet mass derived from the R trk mass response for large-R jets with m/ p T = 0.2.

The double ratio is constructed in two event samples, with different jet flavours (jets originating from light quarks or gluons and jets containing a hadronic top quark decay). The dijet sample used for Fig. 14 is dominated by gluon jets at low transverse momenta, while at higher momenta the fraction of light-quark jets in the sample increases. The tt sample of Sect. 6.2 is enriched in large-R jets that contain a complete highp T object's decay (either a top quark or W boson). In Fig. 18 the double ratios of the two samples are compared for jet p T and jet mass. The jets in the samples correspond to the same pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 2.0 and the same p T and jet mass intervals. In both samples, the double ratio is constructed with the nominal simulation events, which rely on Pythia 8 for hadronization. As systematic uncertainties are expected to partially cancel out, only statistical uncertainties are shown. There is a mild tension between the double-ratio results from the two samples. The double ratio in the tt sample is systematically somewhat higher than the equivalent result in the dijet sample. The difference is typically 1% or less, except in the first bin of the double ratio for jet mass. This is significant compared to the statistical uncertainties but is small in comparison with the modelling uncertainties of the R trk method. Some properties of these two jet populations differ, such as the distribution of their m/ p T and their flavour composition, and so it is not expected that the modelling uncertainties will cancel out exactly. No additional uncertainty is assigned to account for the topology dependence.",

This measurement follows the event selection criteria outlined for the \u03b7-intercalibration provided in Sect. 5.1, including the trigger strategy. The simulation calibration and \u03b7-intercalibration described in Sects. 4 and 5.1 are applied to the large-R jets studied here, and the large-R jet p T is also corrected using the combination of the in situ direct balance techniques discussed in Sects. 5.2, 5.3, and 5.4, which is presented in Sect. 8. The asymmetry distribution of Sect. 5.1 is studied in dijet events in bins of the dijet system p avg T and the probe large-R jet \u03b7 det . The width of the asymmetry distribution depends on the resolution of the jet p T measurement and on the intrinsic particle-level width, which arises due to balance fluctuations and out-of-cone effects. Since the latter effect is uncorrelated with the detector response, the component of the asymmetry width due to the detector resolution can be determined by subtracting in quadrature the asymmetry width of particlelevel ('truth-level') jets from that of reconstructed jets, giving",

These methods exploit the transverse momentum balance in events where a jet recoils against a reference system with a precisely known energy scale, the independence of measurements performed with different sub-detectors, or the position and width of known mass peaks. With this ensemble of techniques, dedicated jet energy scale and jet mass scale calibrations are derived for large-R jets. The results of several techniques applied to a variety of final states are consistent within the uncertainties, indicating that after calibration, the simulations model the flavour dependence of the jet p T and mass response to within a few percent.",

The combined measurement of the ratio of the energy scales in data and simulations are used to derive an in situ correction to the response, which determines the large-R jet energy and mass scales. The residual uncertainty in the ratio of the energy scales in data and simulations is 1-2% for transverse momenta from 150 GeV to 2 TeV. The precision of the jet mass scale varies from 2 to 10% over the same p T range. The results of the simulations for jet p T and mass resolution are also validated in situ and found to agree with the measured resolution within 10-15%. The in situ JES calibration, derived from light quark and gluon jets, is found to fully correct the energy and mass scales of high p T W bosons and top quarks to within the precision of the present measurement (1-3%).",
