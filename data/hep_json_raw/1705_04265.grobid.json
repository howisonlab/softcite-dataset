We examine the initial state radiation reactions e + e \u2212 \u2192 e + e \u2212 \u03b3 ISR and e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 \u03b3 ISR for this search, where the dark photon would appear as an enhancement in the invariant mass distribution of the leptonic pairs. We observe no obvious enhancement in the mass range between 1.5 and 3.4 GeV/c 2 and set a 90% confidence level upper limit on the mixing strength of the dark photon and the Standard Model photon. We obtain a competitive limit in the tested mass range.",

For comparison with data, MC simulation, scaled to the luminosity of data, is shown, although it is not used in the search for the dark photon. In this analysis, the dark photon mass range m \u03b3 between 1.5 and 3.4 GeV/c 2 is studied. The differences between the \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 \u03b3 ISR and e + e \u2212 \u03b3 ISR event yields and their respective 4th order polynomials are added. The combined differences are represented by the black dots in Fig. 2. A dark photon candidate would appear as a peak in this plot. The observed statistical significances are less than 3\u03c3 everywhere in the explored region. The significance in each invariant mass bin is defined as the combined differences between data and the 4th order polynomials, divided by the combined statistical errors of both final states. In conclusion, we observe no dark photon signal for 1.5 GeV/c 2 < m \u03b3 < 3.4 GeV/c 2 , where m \u03b3 is equal to the leptonic invariant mass m l + l \u2212 .

This correction is obtained in bins of m e + e \u2212 by dividing the e + e \u2212 annihilation events only by the sum of events of the annihilation and Bhabha scattering processes. The first is generated with the phokhara event generator by generating the \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 \u03b3 final state and replacing the muon mass with the electron mass.

Exclusion limit at the 90% confidence level on the mixing parameter \u03b5 as a function of the dark photon mass. The bold solid line represents the \u03b5 values, which would explain the discrepancy between the measurement and the SM calculation of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon [3], together with its 2\u03c3 band. a significant signal. We set upper limits on the mixing parameter \u03b5 between 10 \u22123 and 10 \u22124 as a function of the dark photon mass with a confidence level of 90%. This is a competitive limit in this dark photon mass range. The BESIII results, which are based on two years of data taking, are already competitive to the large BaBar data samples, based on 9 years of running. This is possible due to the use of untagged ISR events for the dark photon search as well as the fact that the center-of-mass energy of the BEPCII collider is closer to the mass region tested. We also use a different analysis approach, which has no dependence on the radiator function.",
