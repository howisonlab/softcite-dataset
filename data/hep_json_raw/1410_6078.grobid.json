Events of W and Z bosons decaying into electrons and muons are among the cleanest experimental final states. Measurements of jet production associated with vector bosons provide a stringent test of perturbative QCD (pQCD). These processes are sensitive to new physics effects, and are backgrounds for new physics and Higgs boson searches. These measurements can also provide constraints on Parton Distribution Functions (PDFs) and are used to improve the Monte Carlo generators. In this paper, various V + jets measurements carried out by the CMS experiment [1] are summarised.",
