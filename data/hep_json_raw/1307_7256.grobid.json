Both results are higher than the prediction A FB = 0.088 \u00b1 0.006 [3], which includes both electroweak and QCD next-to-leading order (NLO) corrections. Much effort has been invested to improve the theoretical calculation of the asymmetry in the Standard Model, through the estimation of beyond NLO corrections and related uncertainties. Soft gluon resummation was found to give a negligible contribution [4], electroweak corrections are of the order of 25% and are included in the current predictions [3,5], a calculation based on the Principle of Maximum Conformality (PMC) for the scale setting reports a 40% enhancement, and finally a more realistic estimate of scale uncertainties at NLO of the order 30% should be considered [3,6,7].",

The measurement of A lep FB depends only on lepton charge and direction, and therefore can be measured very precisely.

There are two physical origins of leptonic asymmetry A lep FB , the A FB asymmetry, and the polarisation of the tt system. Leptons partially inherit the asymmetry of the parent tops, and in addition the V-A coupling of the weak interaction connects the direction of the top decay products to the polarisation of the top quarks. Top pairs are a e-mail: stefano.camarda@desy.de produced unpolarised in the Standard Model, an excess of right handed top pairs would enhance A lep FB , while lefthanded pairs would induce a negative contribution.",

As a consequence, events with larger difference between initial state quark and top directions are associated with harder QCD  radiation. Events with more radiation have a larger acceptance because can more easily pass the high p T selection requirements. The uncertainty on the recoil modelling is estimated comparing the acceptance of the nominal powheg Monte Carlo with two other models, namely pythia and alpgen+pythia. The recoil spectra of both pythia and alpgen+pythia are harder than powheg and give larger results for A lep FB , the uncertainty is therefore single-sided.
