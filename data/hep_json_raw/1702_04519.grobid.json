Candidate W -boson pairs are selected by identifying their leptonic decays into an electron, a muon and neutrinos. Events with reconstructed jets are not included in the candidate event sample. The cross-section measurement is performed in a fiducial phase space close to the experimental acceptance and is compared to theoretical predictions. Agreement is found between the measurement and the most accurate calculations available.",

            "text": "Measurements of W W production were first conducted at LEP [1] using electron-positron collisions. Measurements in hadron collisions were first carried out at the Tevatron by the CDF [2,3] and D\u00d8 [4] Collaborations. At the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the W W production cross sections have been measured in protonproton collisions for centre-of-mass energies of \u221a s = 7 TeV and \u221a s = 8 TeV by the ATLAS [5,6] and CMS [7,8] Collaborations. In order to match the experimental precision and address discrepancies between data and theory reported in some of the 8 TeV results, significant progress has been made in theoretical calculations to include higher-order corrections in perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (pQCD) [9][10][11][12][13][14]. The W W signal is composed of three leading sub-processes: qq \u2192 W W production 1 (in the t-and s-channels), non-resonant gg \u2192 W W production, and resonant gg \u2192 H \u2192 W W production (with both gg-initiated processes occurring through a quark loop). These sub-processes are known theoretically at different orders in the strong coupling constant \u03b1 s .",

Separate alternative samples are also generated with POWHEG-BOX v2 interfaced to PYTHIA v6.428 with extra jet radiation emitted in the matrix element and in the parton shower.

This background category includes events where an electron or a muon is produced from a semileptonic decay of a bottom or charm hadron and W W events where one W decays leptonically and the other hadronically. Other diboson (W Z, Z Z , W \u03b3 and Z \u03b3 ) production contributes a smaller background. Minor background processes are modelled with MC simulations, while data-driven methods are used to determine the dominant backgrounds and backgrounds with a misidentified lepton.

The yield from W + jets production is estimated using data event samples that are selected with different lepton selection criteria: a loose lepton identification criterion is defined, leptons are selected using either the loose or the default (as used in the signal region) lepton identification criteria, and events are classified according to whether the leptons, that all satisfy the loose criteria, satisfy or not the default identification criteria. With the introduction of the efficiencies of the default lepton identification relative to the loose lepton identification for both real and misidentified leptons, a system of four equations can be solved to estimate the number of events meeting the default lepton identification criteria. This follows the same procedure as that described in Ref. [6]. For electrons, the loose identification corresponds to the medium criterion defined in Ref. [50] without isolation requirements. For muons, the loose identification is the same as the default one, except that the isolation requirement is omitted. The efficiencies for jet misidentification are determined for electrons and muons separately as a function of the lepton p T and are cross-checked with a two-dimensional parameterisation in the lepton p T and \u03b7. These efficiencies are measured using data in a control region with one lepton, at least one jet and requirements on the lepton-E miss T transverse mass and E miss T to suppress the prompt-lepton contribution from W + jet production. The remaining W + jets contribution in the selected control sample is subtracted using the MC prediction. The efficiencies for real leptons are determined from W W MC simulations with correction factors obtained by comparing Z \u2192``events in data and MC simulation.",

The qq \u2192 W W production cross section is known to O(\u03b1 2 s ) (NNLO) [9,13], the non-resonant gg sub-process is known to O(\u03b1 3 s ) [33], and the resonant gg \u2192 H \u2192 W W cross section is calculated to O(\u03b1 5 s ) [65] taking into account the H \u2192 W W branching fraction [66]. The sum of these sub-processes is denoted by nNNLO+H in the following. In its calculation, the interference between the three sub-processes is neglected. At the given orders of \u03b1 s listed above, the qq \u2192 W W process does not interfere with either of the gg-induced processes and the interference between the gg-induced processes has little contribution to the cross section in the measured phase space. As in the 8 TeV cross-section measurement, possible contributions from double parton interactions are not considered as their contribution is expected to be negligible [6]. The renormalisation and factorisation scales are set to the W boson mass for the qq and non-resonant gg processes, and to m H /2 for gg \u2192 H \u2192 W W . The uncertainties in the qq \u2192 W W cross section are estimated by varying the two scales independently by factors of 0.5 and 2 with the constraint 0.5 \u2264 \u03bc F /\u03bc R \u2264 2, while the uncertainties in the non-resonant and resonant gg cross sections are estimated by simultaneously varying \u03bc R and \u03bc F by factors of 0.5 and 2. The uncertainties in gg \u2192 W W and gg \u2192 H \u2192 W W processes include a 3.2% contribution from PDF uncertainties computed in Ref. [67]. For the qq \u2192 W W process, PDF uncertainties are estimated as the largest of either the CT10 NLO eigenvector uncertainty band (at 68% confidence level) or the difference among the central values of CT10 NLO, MSTW2008nlo and NNPDF3.0 PDFs, amounting to 1.8%. The uncertainties associated with the individual sub-processes are propa- and A. A correction is applied to \u03c3 fid W W \u2192e\u03bc and A to account for non-perturbative effects. The quoted uncertainties include scale variations and PDF uncertainties, with the latter being evaluated at NLO. The scale uncertainties are treated as correlated, whereas PDF uncertainties are treated as uncorrelated between the qq and the gg-induced processes. The values of the branching ratio of leptonic W -boson decay used for each sub-process are those reported in their respective References, while for the resonant gg sub-process B = 0.1083 [69]  gated to the \u03c3 tot W W prediction for the nNNLO+H combination: scale uncertainties of different processes are added linearly, while PDF uncertainties are considered uncorrelated across processes. The qq production makes up 87% of the total cross section while the nonresonant and resonant gg production sub-processes account for 5% and 8% respectively.",

The uncertainty includes the MC statistical uncertainty and the systematic component estimated by comparing the above correction with the one estimated with the non-perturbative model implemented in the HERWIG++ MC event generator. The calculations reported here do not include high-order electroweak corrections. In Ref.

The qq and non-resonant gg acceptances are calculated using the ratios of the respective fiducial cross section to the total cross section. The uncertainties in the A factors for qq and non-resonant gg processes are estimated following the same methodology as for \u03c3 tot W W and considering both the scale and PDF uncertainties as correlated between \u03c3 fid W W \u2192e\u03bc and \u03c3 tot W W . The total uncertainty in A in the nNNLO+H calculation is then determined from the propagation of the A factor uncertainties for the individual sub-processes.

The theoretical cross-section predictions for each production sub-process and the nNNLO+H combination in the total and fiducial phase spaces as well as the A factors (corrected for nonperturbative effects) are given together with their estimated uncertainties in Table 5.

The data used in the analysis correspond to an integrated luminosity of 3.16 fb \u22121 collected by the ATLAS detector at the LHC in 2015. The measurement is made in a relatively pure signal region with the contamination from the dominant background processes estimated using data in dedicated control regions. The measured cross section is 529 \u00b1 20 (stat.) \u00b1 50 (syst.) \u00b1 11 (lumi.) fb and is found to be consistent with the most up-to-date SM predictions that include high-order QCD effects. Furthermore, the ratio of the measured fiducial cross sections at 13 and 8 TeV centre-of-mass energies is compared to the theory predictions with reduced uncertainties, thanks to their cancellation in the ratio.

As part of the jet energy calibration a pile-up correction based on the concept of jet area is applied to the jet candidates [55]. The jet-vertex-tagger (JVT) technique [56] is used to separate hard-scatter jets from pileup jets within the acceptance of the tracking detector by requiring a significant fraction of the jet's summed track p T to come from tracks associated with the primary vertex.
