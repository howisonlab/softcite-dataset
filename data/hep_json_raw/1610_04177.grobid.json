            "text": "Low-energy electronic recoil caused by solar neutrinos in multi-ton xenon detectors is an important subject not only because it is a source of the irreducible background for direct searches of weakly-interacting massive particles (WIMPs), but also because it provides a viable way to measure the solar pp and 7 Be neutrinos at the precision level of current standard solar model predictions. In this work we perform ab initio manybody calculations for the structure, photoionization, and neutrino-ionization of xenon. It is found that the atomic binding effect yields a sizable suppression to the neutrino-electron scattering cross section at low recoil energies. Compared with the previous calculation based on the free electron picture, our calculated event rate of electronic recoil in the same detector configuration is reduced by about 25%. We present in this paper the electronic recoil rate spectrum in the energy window of 100 eV -30 keV with the standard per ton per year normalization for xenon detectors, and discuss its implication for low energy solar neutrino detection (as the signal) and WIMP search (as a source of background).",

For example, recent results by the PandaX-II [1] and LUX [2] experiments, both employing xenon detectors, set their best upper limits on the spin-independent WIMP-nucleon cross section: 2.5 \u00d7 10 \u221246 cm 2 for a 40 GeV/c 2 WIMP and 2.2 \u00d7 10 \u221246 cm 2 for a 50 GeV/c 2 WIMP, respectively.",

To address this important issue, we adopt an ab initio many-body method: the relativistic random phase approximation (RRPA) [13][14][15].

We found that the atomic binding effect yields a sizable suppression to the neutrino-electron scattering cross section at low recoil energies in xenon detectors. Compared with the previous calculation based on the free electron picture, our calculated event rate of electronic recoil in the same detector configuration is reduced by about 30%. This increases the demand of detector volume and/or exposure time for precision measurements of solar neutrino fluxes. However, it also increases the sensitivity to WIMP-nucleon scattering cross section.",

Current observations of lowenergy solar neutrinos including pp and 7 Be are consistent with the MSW-large-mixing-angle (MSW-LMA) solution: It predicts a vacuum-dominated oscillation pattern and the survival probability of electron neutrinos can be approximated as[27] P ee = cos 4 \u03b8 13 1 \u2212 1 2 sin 2 (2\u03b8 12 ) + sin 4 \u03b8 13 .(8)Using the most recent oscillation angles recommended by the Particle Data Group: sin 2 (2\u03b8 12 ) = 0.846 \u00b1 0.021 and sin 2 (2\u03b8 13 ) = 0.085 \u00b1 0.005[28], P ee = 0.553 with an error about 2%. The remaining part of the pp and 7 Be fluxes contains either \u03bd \u00b5 or \u03bd \u03c4 , and scatters with the same differential cross section formula d\u03c3 (\u00b5) /dT = d\u03c3 (\u03c4 ) /dT .In Fig. 2, we show our flux-averaged \u03bd e -Xe differential cross sections (in solid lines) for electron neutrinos of pp, 7 Be(862 keV), and 7 Be(384 keV), respectively. The general trends of d\u03c3/dT show little dependence on neutrino sources, and its functional behavior is largely controlled by the value of T and the binding energies of atomic shells (indicating by the vertical thin lines). The former determines the number of electrons that can be ionized, and the latter gives those sharp edges indicating large differential cross sections whenever an atomic shell is just open. In combination, the largest value of d\u03c3/dT is reached at T \u223c 5 keV, which corresponds to the opening of L shells of xenon.",
