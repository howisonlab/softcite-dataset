Previous measurements [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17] of charm production in DIS at HERA have demonstrated that charm quarks are predominantly produced by the boson gluon fusion process, which is sensitive to the gluon density in the proton. The production of charm quarks contributes up to 30% to the inclusive ep scattering cross section. The correct treatment of effects related to the charm quark contribution in perturbative QCD calculations, in particular the mass effects, is therefore important for the determination of parton distribution functions (PDFs).",

Besides the full reconstruction of a D or D * meson [1-7, 10-12, 15, 16], the lifetime of heavy flavoured hadrons [7-9, 12, 14, 17] or the semi-leptonic decay [13] are exploited. Compared to the other methods, the measurement of D * mesons provides a charm sample with a large signal-to-background ratio. The results presented here are based on a data sample collected by the H1 experiment, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 348 pb \u22121 . Increased statistics, extended phase space, as well as reduced systematic uncertainties compared to the previous H1 analysis [10] make more detailed tests of pQCD predictions possible. Compared to earlier H1 analyses the phase space for the D * meson is extended in transverse momentum from p T (D * ) > 1.5 GeV to p T (D * ) > 1. 25 GeV and in pseudorapidity from |\u03b7(D * )| < 1.5 to |\u03b7(D * )| < 1.8. This extension reduces the amount of extrapolation needed for the determination of F cc 2 .",

Parton showers [20] based on the DGLAP evolution equations [21][22][23][24][25] model higher order QCD effects. The hadronisation of partons is performed with PYTHIA [26] which implements the Lund String Model [27,28]. For the fragmentation of the charm quark into the D * meson the Bowler parameterisation [29] is chosen and the longitudinal part of the fragmentation function is reweighted to the Kartvelishvili parameterisation [30]. The parameter \u03b1 of the Kartvelishvili parameterisation is set to the values measured by H1 [31] which depend on the centre-of-mass energy squared\u015d of the hard subprocess (\u03b3 g \u2192 cc). The threshold between the two regions in\u015d is chosen such that the mean value of\u015d in the lower region is in agreement with the mean\u015d of the event sample without a jet associated with the D * meson [31]. RAPGAP is interfaced to the HERACLES program [32] in order to simulate the radiation of a real photon from the incoming or outgoing lepton and virtual electroweak effects. For the determination of the detector acceptance and efficiency, RAPGAP is used with the PDF set CTEQ6.6M [33] which is derived at next-to-leading order (NLO), but gives a good description of the data. Alternatively, RAPGAP is used with CTEQ6LL [34] derived at LO. The mass of the charm quark is set to m c = 1.5 GeV. The renormalisation scale \u03bc r and the factorisation scale \u03bc f are 2 , where Q 2 denotes the photon virtuality and p * T the transverse momentum of the charm quark in the photon-gluon centre-of-mass frame. The relevant parameter settings and their variations are summarised in Table 1.",

For the comparison to this prediction the analysis is therefore restricted to p * T (D * ) > 2 GeV. The ZM-VFNS uses the fragmentation function determined in [53].

The origin of the H1 coordinate system is the nominal ep interaction point. The direction of the proton beam defines the positive z-axis (forward direction). Transverse momenta are measured in the x-y plane. Polar (\u03b8 ) and azimuthal (\u03c6) angles are measured with respect to this reference system. The pseudo-rapidity is defined as \u03b7 = \u2212 ln tan(\u03b8/2). Charged particles are measured within the central tracking detector (CTD) in the pseudo-rapidity range \u22121.85 < \u03b7 < 1.85. The CTD consists of two large cylindrical jet chambers (CJCs), surrounding the silicon vertex detector CST [57,58]. The CJCs are separated by a drift chamber which improves the z coordinate reconstruction. A multiwire proportional chamber [59], which is mainly used in the trigger, is situated inside the inner CJC. These detectors are arranged concentrically around the interaction region in a magnetic field of 1.16 T. The trajectories of charged particles are measured with a transverse momentum resolution of \u03c3 (p T )/p T \u2248 0.5% p T /GeV \u2295 1.5% [60]. The interaction vertex is reconstructed from CTD tracks. The CTD also provides triggering information based on track segments measured in the CJCs [61][62][63] and a measurement of the specific ionisation energy loss dE/dx of charged particles. The forward tracking detector measures tracks of charged particles at smaller polar angle (1.5 < \u03b7 < 2.8) than the central tracker.",

The number of D * mesons is determined in each analysis bin by a simultaneous fit to the right and the wrong charge m distribution. As the signal has a tail towards larger m values, the asymmetric Crystal Ball function [73] is used for the signal description. The shape of the background is parameterised with the Granet function [74]. An unbinned extended log likelihood fit [75] is performed using the RooFit framework [76]. The fit to the complete data set yields 24705 \u00b1 343 D * mesons. This represents an increase in statistics of an order of magnitude compared to the previous analysis [10]. For each analysis bin the fit to the m spectrum uses the two parameters describing the signal asymmetry obtained from the fit to the complete data set. The width of the peak varies in dependence of the D * kinematics and is therefore treated as a free parameter of the fit.",

An uncertainty of 2% is assigned [17]. Trigger efficiency: The efficiency of the trigger conditions requiring an energy deposition in the SpaCal and a central track is at least 95%. The combined uncertainty is estimated to be 1%. D 0 mass cut: The invariant mass resolution of the data is not fully reproduced by the MC simulation, leading to different efficiencies of the D 0 mass cut. The difference is evaluated by comparing the width of the D 0 signal in data and MC and extrapolating to the region outside of the mass cut assuming a Gaussian distribution [71]. The dependence on the D * kinematics is studied, and the maximum difference of 1.5% is assigned as uncertainty. Reflections: The amount of reflections r from decay modes of the D 0 meson other than D 0 \u2192 K \u2213 \u03c0 \u00b1 is determined using a RAPGAP MC sample of inclusive charm events and is found to amount to 3.8%.

Since CASCADE also provides a reasonable description of the cross sections in the phase space covered in this analysis, it is used as an alternative model to determine F cc 2 exp in order to investigate this model dependence.

In addition to the experimental systematic uncertainties described in Sect. 6 the extrapolation (5) leads to an uncertainty. This extrapolation uncertainty is determined by varying the theory parameters listed in Table 2 simultaneously in the calculation of \u03c3 theo vis and F cc 2 theo . The resulting uncertainties on F cc 2 are shown separately in Fig. 16. HVQDIS and CASCADE both give a reasonable description of the measured cross sections and can be used to extract F cc 2 . The differences obtained in F cc 2 exp for the two models are used to define the model uncertainty on F cc 2 , which is also given in Fig. 16. The results of a F cc 2 measurement based on lifetime information determined with the H1 silicon vertex detector CST [14] is compared to the present measurement in Fig. 16. The two measurements are based on independent methods with similar precision and agree very well. The F cc 2 determined with D * mesons covers a larger range in x due to the larger \u03b7 coverage of the CJCs compared to the CST. It also has smaller uncertainties at low Q 2 , where the uncertainty of the lifetime based measurement is dominated by the light quark background. Figure 16 also compares the FFNS NLO calculation of F cc 2 to the measurement using the MSTW2008f3 and CT10f3 proton PDFs. Both calculations give a reasonable Fig. 16 F cc 2 as derived from D * data with HVQDIS (points). The inner error bars show the statistical uncertainty, the outer error bar the statistical and experimental systematic uncertainty added in quadrature. The extrapolation uncertainty within the HVQDIS model is shown as blue band in the bottom of the plots. The outer (orange) band shows the model uncertainty obtained from the difference in F cc 2 determined with HVQDIS and CASCADE. The data are compared to the measurement of F cc 2 with the H1 vertex detector [14] (open squares), to NLO DGLAP predictions from HVQDIS with two different proton PDFs, and to the F cc 2 prediction of HERAPDF1.0 description of the data. The F cc 2 measurement is also compared to the F cc 2 prediction for HERAPDF1.0 [81], which has been extracted from the H1 and ZEUS combined inclusive proton structure function data. A general-mass variableflavour-number scheme [82,83] has been used which interpolates between the FFNS and the ZM-VFNS. The uncertainty on F cc 2 for the HERAPDF1.0 prediction is dominated by the variation of the charm mass in the PDF fit, which is included in the model uncertainty of the prediction. In general the prediction agrees with the F cc 2 measurement, showing that the gluon density determined from the scaling violations of the inclusive DIS cross section is consistent with that observed in charm production. At large x the central value of the HERAPDF1.0 prediction has a tendency to lie above the F cc 2 data, which may indicate a preference for a larger charm mass than the central value used for HERA-PDF1.0, m c = 1.4 GeV. The F cc 2 measurement is compared to predictions from global PDF fits in Fig. 17: CT10 [47], MSTW2008 NNLO [84] and NNPDF2.1 [85] have been derived in general-mass variable-flavour-number schemes, while for the ABKM fit [86] the FFNS including higher order radiative corrections in QCD adopting the running MS mass has been used. All predictions give a reasonable description of the measurement. At low Q 2 all predictions have a tendency to decrease less steeply with x than the data.",

The extrapolation to the full phase space is done with two different models, using the next-to-leading order calculation HVQDIS and the Monte Carlo program CASCADE based on leading order matrix elements and parton showers. The results for F cc 2 in these two models are very similar except for the highest x values. The results agree well with a measurement based on lifetime information determined with the H1 vertex detector. The data are well described by next-to-leading order calculations using different PDFs, showing that the gluon density determined from the scaling violations of the inclusive DIS cross sections is consistent with the one observed in charm production.",
