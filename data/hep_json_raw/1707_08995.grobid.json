            "text": "In theories with large extra dimensions beyond the standard 4-dimensional spacetime, axions could propagate in such extra dimensions, and acquire Kaluza-Klein (KK) excitations. These KK axions are produced in the Sun and could solve the unexplained heating of the solar corona. While most of the solar KK axions escape from the solar system, a small fraction are gravitationally trapped in orbits around the Sun. They would decay into 2 photons inside a terrestrial detector. The event rate is expected to modulate annually depending on the distance from the Sun. We have searched for the annual modulation signature using 832 \u00d7 359 kg\u2022days of XMASS-I data. No significant event rate modulation is found, and hence we set the first experimental constraint on the KK axion-photon coupling of 4.8 \u00d7 10 \u221212 GeV \u22121 at the 90% confidence level for a KK axion number density ofn a = 4.07 \u00d7 10 13 m \u22123 , the total number of extra dimensions n = 2, and the number of extra dimensions \u03b4 = 2 that axions can propagate in.",

The QCD Lagrangian has a CP-violating term, but this violation has not been observed experimentally. Peccei and Quinn introduced a new global symmetry U(1) PQ to solve this problem (Ref. [1]). This newly introduced symmetry spontaneously breaks at an energy scale of f PQ , which predicts the existence of a pseudo-Goldstone boson, namely the axion. From the experimental results, f PQ is found to be far larger than the electro-weak scale (Ref. [2]). The mass of the axion is characterized by f PQ and calculated to be m a = 6 \u00d7 10 15 eV 2 /f PQ .",

Motions of a particle in the extra dimensions could be observed as new particles with heavier masses in the standard 4-dimensional spacetime. These particles are called Kaluza-Klein (KK) particles. Although the PQ model and large extra dimensions are independently motivated, studies to link them emerged in the late 1990s. It was pointed out that large extra dimensions can explain the largeness of f PQ (Ref. [2]). Following this possible close connection between the PQ model and extra dimensions, studies of axions in extra dimensions, or KK axions, started (Refs. [5,6]).",

It was also pointed out as an independent motivation for the existence of KK axions that solar KK axions may solve some astrophysical observational problems such as solar coronal heating and X-rays from the dark side of the Moon (Ref. [8]). In this scenario, a small fraction of the solar KK axions are gravitationally trapped in orbits around the Sun and accumulated over the age of the Sun. These KK axions then decay into two photons, which become a source of the lunar X-rays. The X-rays from KK axions trapped near the solar surface on the other hand may explain the observed coronal heating. It is argued that a gas time projection chamber (TPC) for direct dark matter searches in an underground laboratory is one of the most suitable instruments to detect the decay of KK axions because of its large volume (\u223c1 m 3 ) and the ability to distinguish 2 photons by recording their tracks (Ref. [9]). No experimental results on solar KK axions have, however, been reported to date.",

A variety of searches had been performed using both nuclear and electron channels (Refs. [11][12][13][14][15]). Thanks to the high photoelectron (PE) yield (about 15 PE/keV), the energy threshold is low enough to search for solar KK axions. XMASS-I data accumulated over more than one year was used for a dark matter direct search in an annual modulation analysis (Ref. [16]). Annual modulation is expected also for the solar KK axion signal due to the seasonal change in the distance between the Sun and Earth. Annual modulation searches have the advantage of being robust against most backgrounds. In this study, we conducted the first direct search for solar KK axions by exploiting this advantage.",

Since there are an infinite number of KK excitations, KK axions with a spectrum of masses would be produced according to the temperature of the Sun. Most of the produced KK axions escape from the solar system, but a small fraction are trapped by the gravity of the Sun. Figure 1 shows the expected number density of trapped KK axions against the distance from the Sun. This distribution is taken from L. Di Lella and K. Zioutas (Ref. [8]) who calculated up to 200R and it is fitted well by r \u22124 . Here, R represents the radius of the Sun. The KK axion-photon coupling g a\u03b3 \u03b3 = 9.2 \u00d7 10 \u221214 GeV \u22121 is fixed so that axion decay can explain the X-ray surface brightness of the quiet Sun. Also, the total number of extra dimensions n = 2, the number of extra dimensions \u03b4 = 2 that axions can propagate in, and the fundamental scale M F = 100 TeV are assumed. The mass dependence of the production rate and the rate of KK axion trapping are also calculated in Ref. [8]. Since the number of trapped KK axions produced by the Primakoff effect is 3 orders of magnitude smaller than the number produced by the photon coalescence mechanism, we concentrate on the contribution from photon coalescence. Since the trapped KK axions are nonrelativistic, the 2 photons from their decay have an energy of m a /2 each. Heavier KK axions are likely to be trapped and would have a shorter lifetime. From the simulation in Ref. [8], which considers the mass dependencies of the trapping rate and the decay rate, the peak of the decay spectrum of the trapped KK axion near the Earth is about 9 keV.",

The shape of the spectrum is assumed to be the same throughout the year, and using the spectrum shown in Fig. 2 as input, the expected energy spectrum is calculated by a Monte Carlo simulation, which is shown in   event selection: (1) The event is triggered only by the ID. (2) The time difference from the previous event is more than 10 ms and the root mean square of hit timings in the event is less than 100 ns. This cut is applied to reject events caused by afterpulses following bright events. 3The ratio of the number of hits in the first 20 ns to the total number of hits is less than 0.6. This cut is applied only to the events with a total number of PE less than 200 in order to remove Cherenkov events originating from 40 K decays in the photocathodes of the PMTs (Ref. [10]). (4) The ratio of the largest number of PE detected by a single PMT to the total number of PE in the event has to be smaller than a certain value. This cut is applied to remove background events occurring in front of a PMT window. The cut value is a function of the total number of PE in the event and varies from about 0.2 at 8 PE to about 0.07 at 50 PE. Details are described in Ref. [16]. Figure 4 shows the energy spectra after each selection step. Most of the remaining events originate from radioactivity in the aluminum seal of the PMTs (Ref. [10]). Seasonal backgrounds, such as radon in the OD water and cosmogenics, are found to be negligible. According to our weekly 57 Co calibration, up to 10% variation of the PE yield was observed throughout the measurement period. This variation is understood to be due to the change of the liquid xenon absorption length, which changed from about 4 m to 11 m (Ref. [16]). The cut efficiency is affected by the variation of this PE yield, and changed up to 10%. We corrected this effect by accounting for relative cut efficiencies as evaluated from MC simulation. The uncertainty of this cut efficiency is found to be the largest systematic error (\u223c \u00b15% on the event rate), and enters as terms K ij into our \u03c7 2 evaluation (see Eq.  systematic uncertainty of the relative cut efficiency becomes 0 at an absorption length of 8 m, and K ij becomes very small around March 2014. The second largest contribution to the systematic error is the nonlinearity of the scintillation yield (\u223c \u00b110% on the event rate). This uncertainty is taken into account in calculating the signal expectation, and is introduced as L i in Eq. (6) below. Between April and September 2014, a different way of calibrating electronics gains led to an additional 0.3% uncertainty in the absolute energy scale of the experiment. This uncertainty is represented as \u03c3 2 sys;i,j in Eq. (5). Other systematic uncertainties were found to be negligible.",

By treating C i and \u03be as free parameters in the fit, \u03c7 2 is minimized. The data is fitted in the energy range between 3 and 22 keV ee , excluding the range between 14 and 17 keV ee . This exclusion avoids systematic effects associated with the end of the range over which the Cherenkov cut is applied, which can be seen in Fig. 3. Figure 5 shows the event rate modulation and the best fit result for the expected event rate. As a result, the fit obtains \u03be = 8.2 \u00d7 10 2 with \u03c7 2 /ndf = 522.4/492.

Since no significant excess in amplitude is found, a 90% confidence level (CL) upper limit is set on the KK axion-photon coupling g a\u03b3 \u03b3 as a function of the KK axion number density.
