            "text": "A search for flavour-changing neutral current decays of a top quark into an up-type quark (q = u, c) and the Standard Model Higgs boson, t \u2192 Hq, is presented. The search is based on a dataset of pp collisions at \u221a s = 13 TeV recorded in 2015 and 2016 with the ATLAS detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb \u22121 . Two complementary analyses are performed to search for top-quark pair events in which one top quark decays into W b and the other top quark decays into Hq, and target the H \u2192 bb and H \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 decay modes, respectively. The high multiplicity of b-quark jets, or the presence of hadronically decaying \u03c4 -leptons, is exploited in the two analyses respectively. Multivariate techniques are used to separate the signal from the background, which is dominated by top-quark pair production. No significant excess of events above the background expectation is found, and 95% CL upper limits on the t \u2192 Hq branching ratios are derived. The combination of these searches with ATLAS searches in diphoton and multilepton final states yields observed (expected) 95% CL upper limits on the t \u2192 Hc and t \u2192 Hu branching ratios of 1.1 \u00d7 10 \u22123 (8.3 \u00d7 10 \u22124 ) and 1.2 \u00d7 10 \u22123 (8.3 \u00d7 10 \u22124 ), respectively. The corresponding combined observed (expected) upper limits on the |\u03bb tcH | and |\u03bb tuH | couplings are 0.064 (0.055) and 0.066 (0.055), respectively.",

            "text": "Following the observation of the Higgs boson by the ATLAS and CMS experiments [1,2] at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), a comprehensive programme of measurements of its properties is underway. An interesting possibility is the presence of flavour-changing neutral-current (FCNC) interactions between the Higgs boson, the top quark, and a uor c-quark, tqH (q = u, c). Since the Higgs boson is lighter than the top quark [3], such interactions would manifest themselves as FCNC top-quark decays [4], t \u2192 Hq. In the Standard Model (SM), such decays are suppressed relative to the dominant t \u2192 W b decay mode, since tqH interactions are forbidden at the tree level and suppressed even at higher orders in the perturbative expansion due to the Glashow-Iliopoulos-Maiani (GIM) mechanism [5]. As a result, the SM predictions for the t \u2192 Hq branching ratios (B) are exceedingly small, B(t \u2192 Hu) \u223c 10 \u221217 and B(t \u2192 Hc) \u223c 10 \u221215 [6][7][8][9], making them undetectable in the foreseeable future. In contrast, large enhancements of these branching ratios are possible in some scenarios beyond the SM. Examples include quarksinglet models [10], two-Higgs-doublet models (2HDM) of type I, with explicit flavour conservation, and of type II, such as the minimal supersymmetric SM (MSSM) [11][12][13][14], supersymmetric models with R-parity violation [15], composite Higgs models with partial compositeness [16], or warped extra dimensions models with SM fermions in the bulk [17]. In these scenarios, branching ratios can be as high as B(t \u2192 Hq) \u223c 10 \u22125 . An even larger branching ratio of B(t \u2192 Hc) \u223c 10 \u22123 can be reached in 2HDM without explicit flavour conservation (type III), since a tree-level FCNC coupling is not forbidden by any symmetry [18][19][20][21][22][23][24][25]. While other FCNC top couplings (tq\u03b3, tqZ, tqg) are also enhanced in these scenarios beyond the SM, the largest enhancements are typically found for the tqH couplings, and in particular the tcH coupling [4].",

The simplifying assumption of SM-like Higgs boson branching ratios is motivated by the fact that measurements of the flavour-diagonal Higgs boson couplings by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations are in agreement with the SM prediction within about 10% [32,33]. Furthermore, typical beyond-the-SM scenarios that predict significant enhancements to B(t \u2192 Hq), also predict modifications to the Higgs boson branching ratios at the few percent level or below, well beyond the current experimental precision.

Finally, searches have also been performed exploiting the dominant Higgs boson decay mode, H \u2192 bb, which has a branching ratio of B(H \u2192 bb) 58%.

Therefore, they help to complete the ATLAS experiment's programme of searches for t \u2192 Hq decays based on pp collision data at \u221a s = 13 TeV recorded in 2015 and 2016. The corresponding integrated luminosity is 36.1 fb \u22121 . Two analyses are performed, searching for tt \u2192 W bHq production (ignoring pp \u2192 tH production) and targeting the H \u2192 bb and H \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 decay modes, which this paper refers to as \"tqH(bb) search\" and \"tqH(\u03c4 \u03c4 ) search\", respectively. The tqH(bb) search selects events with one isolated electron or muon from the W \u2192 \u03bd decay, and multiple jets, several of which are identified with high purity as originating from the hadronisation of b-quarks. The tqH(\u03c4 \u03c4 ) search selects events with two \u03c4 -lepton candidates, at least one of which decays hadronically, as well as multiple jets. The latter requirement aims to select events with a hadronically decaying W boson, since this allows an improved reconstruction of the event kinematics.",

These two searches are combined with previous ATLAS searches in the diphoton and multilepton final states using the same dataset [29,30], and bounds are set on B(t \u2192 Hc) and B(t \u2192 Hu), as well as on the corresponding non-flavour-diagonal Yukawa couplings. The combination is performed after verifying the overall consistency of the results obtained by the different searches, which exploit very different experimental signatures and thus are affected by different backgrounds and related systematic uncertainties. By combining all searches, the expected sensitivity is improved by about a factor of two relative to the most sensitive individual results.",

Hadronic calorimetry is provided by a steel/scintillator-tile calorimeter, segmented into three barrel structures within |\u03b7| < 1.7, and two copper/LAr hadronic endcap calorimeters. The solid angle coverage is completed with forward copper/LAr and tungsten/LAr calorimeter modules optimised for electromagnetic and hadronic measurements, respectively. The calorimeters are surrounded by a muon spectrometer within a magnetic field provided by air-core toroid magnets with a bending integral of about 2.5 Tm in the barrel and up to 6 Tm in the endcaps. The muon spectrometer measures the trajectories of muons with |\u03b7| < 2.7 using multiple layers of high-precision tracking chambers, and is instrumented with separate trigger chambers covering |\u03b7| < 2.4.

Candidates are required to have p T > 25 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.5, excluding the EM calorimeter's transition region. A boosted decision tree (BDT) discriminant [56][57][58] using calorimeter-and tracking-based variables is used to identify \u03c4 had candidates and reject jet backgrounds. Three working points labelled loose, medium and tight are defined, and correspond to different \u03c4 had identification efficiency values, with the efficiency designed to be independent of p T . The tqH(\u03c4 \u03c4 ) search uses the medium working point for the nominal selection, while the loose working point is used for background estimation. The medium working point has a combined reconstruction and identification efficiency of 55% (40%) for one-prong (three-prong) \u03c4 had decays [59], and an expected rejection factor against light-jets of 100 [55].

In the tqH(bb) search, firstly, electron candidates that lie within \u2206R = 0.01 of a muon candidate are removed to suppress contributions from muon bremsstrahlung. Overlaps between electron and jet candidates are resolved next, and finally, overlaps between remaining jet candidates and muon candidates are removed. Energy clusters from identified electrons are not excluded during jet reconstruction. In order to avoid double-counting of electrons as jets, the closest jet whose axis is within \u2206R = 0.2 of an electron is discarded. If the electron is within \u2206R = 0.4 of the axis of any jet after this initial removal, the jet is retained and the electron is removed. The overlap removal procedure between the remaining jet candidates and muon candidates is designed to remove those muons that are likely to have arisen in the decay of hadrons and to retain the overlapping jet instead. Jets and muons may also appear in close proximity when the jet results from high-p T muon bremsstrahlung, and in such cases the jet should be removed and the muon retained. Such jets are characterised by having very few matching inner-detector tracks. Selected muons that satisfy \u2206R(\u00b5, jet) < 0.04 + 10 GeV/p \u00b5 T are rejected if the jet has at least three tracks originating from the primary vertex; otherwise the jet is removed and the muon is kept. The overlap removal procedure in the tqH(\u03c4 \u03c4 ) search is similar to that of the tqH(bb) search, except that the first step is the removal of \u03c4 had candidates within \u2206R = 0.2 of electrons or muons, and the last step is the removal of jets whose axis lies within \u2206R = 0.2 of the leading (highest-p T ) \u03c4 had candidate or the two leading \u03c4 had candidates (depending on the search channel). In addition, the muon-jet overlap removal is slightly different: if a muon lies within \u2206R = 0.2 of the axis of a jet, the jet is removed if either it has fewer than three tracks originating from the primary vertex or it has a small p T compared with that of the muon (the p T of the jet is less than 50% of the p T of the muon, or the scalar sum of the p T of the tracks associated with the jet is less than 70% of the p T of the muon).",

            "text": "The tt background selected by the tqH(bb) search is enriched in tt+heavy-flavour production, and thus requires a more sophisticated treatment than provided by the nominal tt sample; this treatment is briefly outlined below. A detailed discussion can be found in ref. [77]. The simulated tt events are categorised depending on the flavour content of additional particle jets not originating from the decay of the tt system. Events labelled as either tt+\u22651b or tt+\u22651c are generically referred to in the following as tt+HF events, where HF stands for heavy flavour. The remaining events are labelled as tt+light-jets events, including those with no additional jets. A finer categorisation of tt+\u22651b events is considered for the purpose of applying further corrections and assigning systematic uncertainties associated with the modelling of heavy-flavour production in different event topologies [77]. In particular, the tt+\u22651b events are reweighted to an NLO prediction in the four-flavour (4F) scheme of tt+\u22651b production including parton showering [78], based on Sherpa+OpenLoops [79,80] (referred to as SherpaOL in the following) using the CT10 4F PDF set. This reweighting is performed in such a way that the inter-normalisations of the tt+\u22651b categories are at NLO accuracy, while preserving the tt+\u22651b cross section of the nominal tt sample. This reweighting is also applied to the alternative tt samples that are used to study systematic uncertainties.",

Furthermore, in a significant fraction of tt \u2192 W bHq simulated events (about 40-50% in regions with exactly three b-tagged jets), the light-quark jet from the hadronic top-quark decay is not among the selected jets. Similarly, in about 30-40% (50-90%) of simulated tt+light-jets (tt+ \u2265 1b) background events in regions with exactly three b-tagged jets, the light-quark jet originating from the W boson decay is also not selected. Thus, the calculation of P sig and P bkg also includes an additional hypothesis to account for this topology, again weighted by the corresponding fractions. In this case, the invariant masses involving the missing jet are computed using the highest-p T jet not matched to a decay product from the tt system. Figure 2 shows a comparison between data and prediction in the most sensitive analysis region, (4j, 3b), for several kinematic variables associated with the reconstructed lepton, jets, and missing transverse momentum. The distributions shown correspond to the lepton p T , the E miss T , the scalar sum of the transverse momenta of the jets, and the invariant mass distribution of the two b-tagged jets with lowest \u2206R separation. The variables displayed do not correspond directly to those used internally in the evaluation the LH discriminant, as to build them it is necessary to select a particular signal or background hypothesis and a jet permutation. Instead, these distributions are shown to demonstrate that a good description of the data by the background prediction is observed in several kinematic variables related to the information used in the LH discriminant construction. Figure 3 compares the shape of the LH discriminant distribution between the tt \u2192 W bHc and tt \u2192 W bHu signals and the tt \u2192 W bW b background in each of the analysis regions considered. Since this analysis has higher expected sensitivity to a tt \u2192 W bHc signal than to a tt \u2192 W bHu signal, in order to allow probing of the B(t \u2192 Hu) versus B(t \u2192 Hc) plane, the LH discriminant optimised for tt \u2192 W bHc is used for both decay modes.

This compatibility is assessed via a likelihood function that depends on the reconstructed mass of the three-jet system and the two non-b-tagged jets. For the remaining events, the selected jets are assigned to the different top-quark decay products via a criterion based on minimising a sum of angular distances between objects. Finally, the four-momenta of the invisible decay products for each \u03c4 -lepton decay are estimated by minimising a \u03c7 2 function based on the probability density functions for the angular distance of the visible and invisible products of the \u03c4lepton decay, and including Gaussian constraints on the \u03c4 -lepton mass, the Higgs boson mass and the measured E miss T within their expected resolutions. The resolution on the \u03c4 -lepton mass and the Higgs boson mass are taken to be 1.8 GeV and 20 GeV, respectively, while the resolution on the measured E miss T is parameterised as a linear function of E T , with E T denoting the scalar sum of the p T of all physics objects contributing to the E miss T reconstruction [60]. After the \u03c7 2 minimisation, the Higgs boson four-momentum, and hence its invariant mass, as well as the four-momentum of the parent top quark, are determined with better resolution. Following the event kinematic reconstruction, several kinematic variables that discriminate between signal and background are defined. These variables are used in the multivariate analysis discussed in the next section.",

An uncertainty of 6% is assigned to the inclusive tt production cross section [71], including contributions from varying the factorisation and renormalisation scales, as well as from the top-quark mass, the PDF and \u03b1 S . The latter two represent the largest contribution to the overall theoretical uncertainty in the cross section and were calculated using the PDF4LHC prescription [111] with the MSTW 2008 68% CL NNLO, CT10 NNLO [82,112] and NNPDF2.3 5F FFN [65] PDF sets. The uncertainty associated with the choice of NLO generator is derived by comparing the nominal prediction from Powheg-Box+Pythia 8 with a prediction from Sherpa 2.2.1. For the latter, the matrix-element calculation is performed for up to two partons at NLO and up to four partons at LO using Comix and OpenLoops, and merged with the Sherpa parton shower using the ME+PS@NLO prescription. The uncertainty due to the choice of parton shower and hadronisation (PS & Had) model is derived by comparing the predictions from Powheg-Box interfaced either to Pythia 8 or Herwig 7. The latter uses the MMHT2014 LO [113] PDF set in combination with the H7UE tune [114]. The uncertainty in the modelling of additional radiation is assessed with two alternative Powheg-Box+Pythia 8 samples: a sample with increased radiation (referred to as radHi) is obtained by decreasing the renormalisation and factorisation scales by a factor of two, doubling the h damp parameter, and using the Var3c upward variation of the A14 parameter set; a sample with decreased radiation (referred to as radLow) is obtained by increasing the scales by a factor of two and using the Var3c downward variation of the A14 set [115].",

The total normalisation uncertainty of V +jets processes is estimated by comparing the data and total background prediction in the different analysis regions considered, but requiring exactly zero b-tagged jets. Agreement between data and predicted background in these modified regions, which are dominated by V +light-jets, is found to be within approximately 30%.

This function depends on the signal-strength parameter \u00b5, defined as a factor multiplying the expected yield of tt \u2192 W bHq signal events normalised to a reference branching ratio B ref (t \u2192 Hq) = 1%, and \u03b8, a set of nuisance parameters that encode the effect of systematic uncertainties on the signal and background expectations. Therefore, the expected total number of events in a given bin depends on \u00b5 and \u03b8.

Statistical uncertainties in each bin of the predicted final discriminant distributions are taken into account by dedicated parameters in the fit.

In both cases, the robustness of the model for systematic uncertainties is established by verifying the stability of the fitted background when varying assumptions about some of the leading sources of uncertainty. After this, the blinding requirements are removed in the data and a fit under the signal-plus-background hypothesis is performed. Further checks involve the comparison of the fitted nuisance parameters before and after removal of the blinding requirements, and their values are found to be consistent.

The tt+ \u2265 1c normalisation is also increased, by a factor of 1.34 \u00b1 0.40. These corrections are in agreement with those found in ref. [77]. Additionally, a few nuisance parameters are adjusted by the fit, with the largest effects corresponding to the leading nuisance parameters related to the b-tagging and c-tagging calibrations (by about 0.8 standard deviations), and those related to tt+ \u2265 1b and tt+ \u2265 1c modelling, which are based on a comparison with alternative generators (by 0.5 standard deviations or less). The leading uncertainties affecting the signal extraction by the fit are related to the c-tagging calibration (\u2206B \u223c 1.5 \u00d7 10 \u22123 ), followed by the tt+light-jets PS & Had uncertainty (\u2206B \u223c 1.2 \u00d7 10 \u22123 ). Smaller contributions (\u2206B \u223c 0.5-1.0 \u00d7 10 \u22123 each) result from the uncertainties associated with the tt+ \u2265 1b 5F vs 4F comparison, the dependence of jet energy scale on the jet flavour, the uncertainty of the tt+ \u2265 1c normalisation, and the limited size of the simulated samples in some of the bins with the highest signal-to-background ratio. The uncertainty most strongly constrained by the fit is that related to the c-tagging calibration. It is reduced by about a factor of two of its value as originally determined in W +c-jet events [53]. This is possible because the fit exploits the large number of tt events with two and three b-tagged jets to effectively perform a c-tagging calibration, whose results are found to be consistent with those of ref. [109]. Beyond the constraints on a few individual uncertainties, the significant reduction of the total background uncertainty achieved by the fit primarily derives from the anti-correlations found among systematic uncertainties from different sources.",

The obtained normalisation factors for the fake \u03c4 had background agree within 1% with those obtained by the tt \u2192 W bHc search. In both cases, the uncertainty of the measured branching ratio is dominated by the statistical uncertainty. The main contributions to the total systematic uncertainty arise from the fake \u03c4 had background estimation and the uncertainty associated with the different responses to quark-initiated and gluon-initiated jets. No significant excess of data events above the background expectation is found, and observed (expected) 95% CL limits are set on B(t \u2192 Hc) and B(t \u2192 Hu): B(t \u2192 Hc) < 1.9 \u00d7 10 \u22123 (2.1 \u00d7 10 \u22123 ) and B(t \u2192 Hu) < 1.7\u00d710 \u22123 (2.0\u00d710 \u22123 ).
