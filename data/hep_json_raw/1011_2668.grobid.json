Kaons originate from the decay of \u03c6-mesons produced in e + e \u2212 collisions. We have used the above samples to measure many properties of kaons such as masses, branching ratios and lifetimes, Refs. [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10]. The ultimate motivation was the determination of the quark mixing parameter V us , see Ref. [7]. KLOE had not however attempted to measure the K S lifetime. From the reaction chain e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c6, \u03c6 \u2192 K L K S (K L is unobserved) and K S \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decay, we determine the K S -meson vector momentum p K , the kaon production point P and its decay point D. From our best estimate of p K , P and D, defined in detail later, we obtain the decay proper time of the K S .",

In addition KLOE fully accounts for radiative corrections, which are crucial in obtaining final accuracies well below 0.1% for any measured physical quantity. Radiative corrections are incorporated in the KLOE Monte Carlo Geanfi, see Ref. [9], at the event generator level. Thus the MC generated events are fully dressed of the appropriate radiation, both initial and final. Our measurement of the neutral kaon mass fully exploited the above feature, Ref. [10].

The invariant mass of the two tracks, assumed to be pions, must satisfy |M \u03c0\u03c0 \u2212 M K 0 | < 5 MeV. D is taken as the decay point. The kaon momentum p K can be obtained from the sum of the pion momenta.

Bottom. Distribution of p = p K \u2212 p K for data (dots), and Monte Carlo (line) corresponding to the initial sample selection, histogram a, top. The tail at left is due to the initial state radiation direction (always from pions) and the kinematic. We call the latter value p K . In this analysis we use p K to evaluate \u03b2\u03b3 , being less sensitive to the momentum calibration. The magnitude of the two values of the kaon momentum must agree to within 10 MeV. Figure 1 bottom shows the distribution of p = p K \u2212 p K , the difference in magnitude of the two momentum determinations, for data and MC. If the two tracks intersect in more than one point satisfying the above requirements, the one closest to the origin is retained as the K S decay point. We refer to the finding of D as vertexing. The above procedure selects a K S \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 sample almost 100% pure. The largest background contribution, K L \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decay close to the interaction point, is smaller than 5 \u00d7 10 \u22126 . For each event we need the kaon production point P. In fact only the z-coordinate of P is required since the interaction region is 2-3 cm long while the other dimensions are negligible and the x, y coordinates well known. P lies on the beam axis and is taken as the point of closest approach to the K S path as determined by the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 tracks. The resolution in z P is about 2 mm. Events with |z P | > 2 cm are rejected. From the length of PD and p K we compute the proper time in units of a reference value of \u03c4 , the lifetime value used in our MC, \u03c4 = 89.53 ps. Its residual distribution is shown in Fig. 1 top, histogram a. The distribution has an rms spread of 0.86 \u03c4 and is not symmetric. Time resolution can be improved discarding events with poor vertexing resolution. From MC we observe that bad vertex reconstruction is correlated with large values of p. Therefore we cut the angular regions where p begins significantly to increase. We retain events with cos \u03b1 \u03c0\u03c0 < \u22120.87, being \u03b1 \u03c0\u03c0 the opening angle of the pion pair. We must also distinguish between the two \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 'V' configurations illustrated in Fig. 2, because they are differently affected by a miscalibration of pion momentum.

The K L interaction point in the calorimeter together with the known \u03c6 momentum gives an independent determination of the K S direction. The calibration is checked comparing for each run period the difference of the two determinations. Typically for a 20k events sample we find a \u223c0.002 \u2022 difference (corresponding to 10 \u22125 \u00b5m on K S decay length), well within the error. We found consistent determinations in all periods. The final efficiency for K S \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 detection is shown in Fig. 3 as a function of proper time. While the K S \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 reconstruction efficiency, about 68% due to the geometrical acceptance, does not depend on the K S direction, the efficiency after our sample selection does. Almost flat in proper time it is on average \u223c9%. Errors in the reconstruction of the pion tracks can bias the position of D. Studies of the Fig. 2 The two configurations for a K S \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decay momentum calibration [10] show a fractional error of about 2 \u00d7 10 \u22124 . For a \u223c200 MeV/c transverse momentum track the above error corresponds to about 0.3 mm change on the radius of the track. To check the correctness of track reconstruction we divide all data into two sample with \u03b1 \u22a5 \u03c0 + K > 0 and < 0 (see Fig. 2). A track momentum overestimate (underestimate) moves the position of D toward (away from) P for \u03b1 \u22a5 \u03c0 + K > 0 and viceversa for \u03b1 \u22a5 \u03c0 + K < 0. The K S lifetimes evaluated for the two samples differ by \u223c6%, consistent with what expected from our momentum accuracy. We do correct for this effect. From MC-Data comparison we obtain the correction, K , to be applied to the K S decay length, as a function of p, used as an estimator of the momentum miscalibration. After applying this correction the 6% difference mentioned above is reduced to \u223c10 \u22123 , although the new average result is only \u223c2\u03c3 (0.1%) different from the result before applying it.",
