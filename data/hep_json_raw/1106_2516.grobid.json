As an example, the ATLAS collaboration set a goal of 10% momentum resolution for 1 TeV muons expected from some new physics signatures. This implies a resolution of 50 \u00b5m on the sagitta measurement for trajectories that are nearly straight in the muon spectrometer.

This multiplication factor makes it possible to observe the passage of a particle in a relatively low-density medium. The position resolution of such detectors depends on exact knowledge of the drift time and is limited by placement accuracy of the central wires. Another detector type uses solid-state semiconductors, usually silicon, as the interaction medium. Particles passing through the semiconductor ionize valence electrons and create electron-hole pairs, which drift under an applied electric field to strip or pixel readout elements patterned on the surface. These detectors benefit from increased ionization energy loss (roughly 400 keV/mm), but there is no amplification of collected charge, and special low-noise readout electronics are required to detect the signal. A major advantage of these detectors is that the readout element patterns can be microns apart, yielding extremely good position resolution. The disadvantages with respect to gaseous detectors are cost (gas is much cheaper than lithographed silicon) and processing requirements. Any defects in the semiconductor crystal trap the charge carriers and prevent them from reaching the readout elements.

First, exotic charged massive particles (CHAMPs) typically have low velocities, with \u03b2 significantly less than 1. This causes them to lose greater amounts of energy through ionization, and they may even stop in the middle of the detector if the energy loss is great enough. Since the particles are massive they do not shower in the electromagnetic calorimeter. R-hadrons, stable particles with heavy colored constituents, can have similar signatures. Doubly-charged particles lose q 2 = 4 times the normal ionization energy loss in the tracking detectors, a unique signature for any experiment with dE/dx sensitivity. Second, metastable particles, such as long-lived neutralinos in theories of supersymmetry breaking, may have c\u03c4 values of order 1 m, and the decay products do not point back to the primary interaction vertex. Even though it is challenging to reconstruct particles originating in the middle of the detector, successful reconstruction makes it possible to measure the lifetime of the parent particle. Third, exotic \"quirks,\" predicted in new theories of strong interactions, can appear as a mesoscopic bound state, with properties similar to a doubly-charged particle, or as a state that oscillates like a macroscopic string with two charge endpoint particles.",

In the past decade experimentalists have become more sophisticated in defining jets and comparing measurements with theoretical predictions. Such comparisons are always made at the \"particle-level\" or \"hadron-level,\" after the parton shower and hadronization but before the detector interaction occurs.

These effects are estimated using calibration data samples in the jet-jet or \u03b3+jet signatures, where the true jet energy can be estimated from the other object's recoil.

The heavy quarks stand out for their long lifetimes (due to CKM suppression), large mass with respect to their decay products, and high multiplicity decays. These properties give rise to a distinct decay geometry, shown in Fig. 4. The momentum vectors of decay products from the B point to a secondary vertex, not the primary interaction vertex, and the distance between the two vertices depends on the b lifetime, if we use the spectator model approximation for the decay of the heavy quark hadron. Typical values before boost factors are c\u03c4 b = 500 \u00b5m, c\u03c4 c = 500 \u00b5m, and c\u03c4 \u03c4 = 90 \u00b5m. Because finding a common vertex for two or more tracks is one of the most challenging problems in tracking, the impact parameter of a track is used as a proxy to determine if it is consistent with having come from the primary interaction vertex. If a large number of tracks in a jet are inconsistent with the primary vertex, then it is likely that there is a heavy flavor hadron in the jet. One of the primary motivations for developing precision solid-state tracking detectors, which are even sometimes named \"vertex detectors,\" is to measure track parameters precisely enough to allow for vertexing. The same parameters are also use for exact impact parameter measurements with 10% precision on values of O(300 \u00b5m). Flavor tagging algorithms are not limited to decay lengths and impact parameters. Identifying medium-p T leptons from semileptonic heavy flavor decays provides an independent tagging mechanism. Since charm quarks also have long lifetimes and semileptonic decays, we use discriminating variables based on the mass of all particles in the secondary vertex to distinguish b-jets from cjets. Ultimately, multivariate techniques combine information from all of these measurements to give powerful separation between b, c and light quark jets. Tighter requirements on b-jets reduce c and light quark jet contamination but also reduce the b-tagging efficiency, as shown in Fig. 5.",

After two tau lepton candidates have been reconstructed in an event, using algorithms that identify fully leptonic decay or hadronic decay, the missing transverse energy is used to estimate the energy taken by two or more neutrinos. With no other information, the kinematic system would be underconstrained, and mass reconstruction of the \u03c4 \u03c4 system would be impossible. If one assumes the tau leptons from Higgs decays are highly boosted, then the neutrinos in the tau decay all have the same momentum as their sister decay products. With this trick, it is possible to reconstruct the full tau momentum and calculate the invariant mass of the Higgs candidate (see Exercise 8). Higgs decays to two photons are a tiny fraction of all decays, but there are no diphoton resonances in the Standard Model above 1 GeV, so any sign of a resonance would be a clear indication of new physics. The LHC experiments, particularly ATLAS and CMS, have been designed to have excellent resolution for both photon energy and direction, and significant effort has gone into rejecting fake photons (misidentified electrons or jets) to reduce background. The non-resonant diphoton background can be measured as a falling distribution in data, as shown in Fig. 7 compared to the signal expectations for Standard Model Higgs production.

First, the presence of two high-p T neutrinos means there is no invariant mass peak for the reconstructed Higgs. (Since the W bosons are not boosted, the reconstruction trick from the tau channel cannot be re-used.) Second, direct W W production and top quark pairs have similar dilepton+E miss T signatures, but even here there is one extra trick for selecting W W pairs from Higgs decay. Because the Higgs is a scalar boson with spin 0, the two W bosons from Higgs decay must have opposite spin, and the leptons from W decay tend to be closer in direction than in the tt case. The angle between leptons is one of several input variables for multivariate tools that separate Higgs signal from SM background. This technique has already been used at the Tevatron to exclude certain Higgs mass hypotheses between 158 and 175 GeV [13].",

One way to reduce the bb background is to require associated production of W, Z or tt, and all of these associated production channels are being studied. A novel idea focuses the W H/ZH search to the region of phase space where the vector boson has large transverse momentum. Events in this region have a highly-boosted Higgs boson and bb decay products observed in a single fat jet. By shrinking the jet clustering radius until the two b subjets are resolved (as in Fig. 9), it is possible to compare the masses of the  Figure 9: Description of jet algorithm to identify boosted jets and substructure within [18].

Results in this section are a sampling of techniques used in new physics searches. Perhaps the most straightforward signature shared by BSM models is the total event energy. New physics related to the terascale often has energies near this scale. The outgoing events in the hard scatter set the event scale, which is near the mass of the heavy new particles.
