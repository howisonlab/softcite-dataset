The LHC multi-TeV beams allow for the most energetic fixed-target experiments ever performed, opening new domains of particle and nuclear physics and complementing that of collider physics, in particular that of RHIC and the EIC projects. The luminosity achievable with AFTER@LHC using typical targets would surpass that of RHIC by more that 3 orders of magnitude in a similar energy region. In unpolarised proton-proton collisions, AFTER@LHC allows for measurements of TMDs such as the Boer-Mulders quark distributions, the distribution of unpolarised and linearly polarised gluons in unpolarised protons. Using the polarisation of hydrogen and nuclear targets, one can measure transverse single-spin asymmetries of quark and gluon sensitive probes, such as, respectively, Drell-Yan pair and quarkonium production. The fixed-target mode has the advantage to allow for measurements in the target-rapidity region, namely at large x \u2191 in the polarised nucleon. Overall, this allows for an ambitious spin program which we outline here.",

Nevertheless, it has recently been emphasised that a a e-mail: Jean-Philippe.Lansberg@in2p3.fr class of spin-dependent partonic distributions can be studied even in the absence of polarised proton. In fact, the polarised particle is, in this case, the parton in an unpolarised nucleon and a correlation effect arises for nonzero partonic transverse momenta. In the quark case, these quantities are named Boer-Mulders distributions [5]. In principle, the LHC machine can thus also be used to perform spinrelated measurements.",

Table 1 also gathers the corresponding values for the Pb run of 10 6 s. the discussions of the next sections. A more complete survey of the physics opportunities with AFTER@LHC can be found in [6]. Given the possibility of studying a number of colliding systems, such as proton-proton, proton-deuteron, leadproton, lead-nucleus, proton-polarised-nucleon and leadpolarised-nucleon, we believe that AFTER@LHC should be designed as a multi-purpose detector. As such, it would de facto become a heavy-flavour, quarkonium and promptphoton observatory [6,9] in pp and pA collisions given the outstanding expected luminosity combined to an access towards low P T . In turn, thanks also to the complementary forthcoming LHC results, it is sound to expect that the production mechanisms of quarkonia [23] would eventually be constrained thanks to the large quarkonium yields and precise measurements of their correlations.

            "text": "In [40], we discussed the possibility of extracting the polarised and unpolarised gluon TMDs, f g 1 (x, k T , \u03bc) and h \u22a5g 1 (x, k T , \u03bc) through the production of a quarkonium associated with a back-to-back and isolated photon at the LHC,  thus with unpolarised protons. Contrary to the inclusive production of quarkonium + photon pair, which has been shown to help to disentangle color-octet (CO) from colorsinglet (CS) contributions [41][42][43], back-to-back production tends to be dominated by CS contributions [44] at least at low transverse momenta. In addition, it is less prone to QCD corrections, which simplifies its theoretical study. In the case of J/\u03c8 and \u03a5 production, the requirement for back-to-back production essentially selects the topologies of graphs Fig. 3b; these are dominated by gluon fusion as expected at high energies for heavy-quark production. If CS contributions are indeed dominant, TMD factorisation should apply and the measurements of the yield as a function of the transverse-momentum imbalance of the pair, q T , should give, for the first time, a direct access to f g 1 (x, k T , \u03bc). Moreover, the study of azimuthallymodulated moments of the yields as function of q T should allow one to look for a nonzero linear polarisation of gluons inside unpolarised protons by extracting h \u22a5g 1 (x, k T , \u03bc). At the LHC, the study of isolated photons usually imposes to require a minimal transverse momentum, of the order of 10 GeV. At lower energies, it is likely possible to cope with a lower threshold, for instance 4 GeV, thanks to the lower particle multiplicities, especially in the backward region accessible with AFTER@LHC. It is nonetheless legitimate to wonder whether such an observable would still be sensitive to gluons in the region of rather large x values. Let us recall that x 1,2 = Q/ \u221a se \u00b1Y . Thus, for Q = 10 GeV and Y = \u22122, x 2 0.65. We have checked the gluon-fusion dominance as illustrated by Fig. 2. From left to right, the rapidity Y of the pair is getting more negative. First, the qq contribution remains negligible -at most a percent of that from gg. Second, the CS contribution (solid blue curve) remains above the CO one (orange dashed curve) up to Q 20 GeV. At Q 10 GeV, the expected CO contribution is less than a quarter of the CS one and can be disregarded for a first TMD extraction. In fact, it can also simply be removed by isolating the J/\u03c8 as well; this would be required if the measured value of the q T integrated yield was higher than expected and thus indicative of a larger CO yield. Finally, we wish to stress that we do not expect higher-twist contributions such as intrinsic-charm (IC) quark coalescence [45] to contribute to (back-to-back) J/\u03c8 + \u03b3 production. As opposed to inclusive J/\u03c8 production for which one has J/\u03c8 + g at LO and for which the color of the nonperturbative IC fluctuations can be bleached by the finalstate gluon emission, the emission of the final-state photon is irrelevant; an additional gluon emission is needed for this mechanism to contribute. In terms of expected counts, since the differential cross section is on the order of tens of fb/GeV, one can reasonably expects a couple of thousands of events per year (i.e. per 20 fb \u22121 ) with a hydrogen target. This is definitely sufficient to look at the k T dependence of f g 1 (x, k T , \u03bc) as well as to look at the magnitude of h \u22a5g 1 (x, k T , \u03bc) at large x. Another observable where the TMD factorisation should be applicable is J/\u03c8-pair production. As for J/\u03c8+\u03b3 production, the final state (see e.g. [27]) can be fully color singlet (see Fig. 3c). Its analysis should also be very well accessible with AFTER@LHC.",

Such a measurement is certainly possible with AFTER@LHC with a transversely polarised target. An important point is to be able to carry out such a measurement down to low P T where both approaches are applicable and can legitimately be compared. In any case, such a measurement would be extremely useful to tell whether or not such a gluon Sivers effect does exist. The PHENIX collaboration [48] has measured the STSA in J/\u03c8 production at \u221a s = 200 GeV. They reported a value of A N compatible with 0 with a slightly negative central value. More precise data are definitely needed. AFTER@LHC can certainly push far forward the precision limit on such a measurement. It is noteworthy to emphasise the possibility to collide lead ions on a polarised target since a number of theoretical ideas have been proposed lately in the case of p \u2191 A collisions.",
