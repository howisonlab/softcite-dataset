The chargedparticle multiplicity, its dependence on transverse momentum and pseudorapidity and the dependence of the mean transverse momentum on the charged-particle multiplicity are presented. The measurements are performed with charged particles with transverse momentum greater than 500 MeV and absolute pseudorapidity less than 2.5, in events with at least one charged particle satisfying these kinematic requirements. Additional measurements in a reduced phase space with absolute pseudorapidity less than 0.8 are also presented, in order to compare with other experiments. The results are corrected for detector effects, presented as particle-level distributions and are compared to the predictions of various Monte Carlo event generators.",

Particle interactions at these energy scales are typically described by QCD-inspired models implemented in Monte Carlo (MC) event generators with free parameters that can be constrained by such measurements. An accurate description of low-energy strong interaction processes is essential for simulating single pp interactions as well as the effects of multiple pp interactions at high instantaneous luminosity in hadron colliders. Charged-particle distributions have been measured previously in pp and proton-antiproton collisions at various centre-of-mass energies [1-7] (and references therein).",

The distributions are measured using tracks from primary charged particles, corrected for detector effects, and are presented as inclusive distributions in a well-defined kinematic region. Primary charged particles are defined as charged particles with a mean lifetime \u03c4 > 300 ps, either directly produced in pp interactions or from subsequent decays of directly produced particles with \u03c4 < 30 ps; particles produced from decays of particles with \u03c4 > 30 ps, called secondary particles, are excluded. This definition differs from earlier analyses in that charged particles with a mean lifetime 30 < \u03c4 < 300 ps were previously included. These are charged strange baryons and have been removed due to the low efficiency of reconstructing them. 1 All primary charged particles are required to have a momentum component transverse to the beam direction, 2 p T , of at least 500 MeV and absolute pseudorapidity, |\u03b7|, less than 2.5. Each event is required to have at least one primary charged particle. 1 Since strange baryons tend to decay within the detector volume, especially if they have low momentum, they often do not leave enough hits to reconstruct a track, leading to a track reconstruction efficiency of approximately 0.3%. 2 ATLAS uses a right-handed coordinate system with its origin at the nominal interaction point (IP) in the centre of the detector and the z-axis along the beam pipe. The x-axis points from the IP to the centre of the LHC ring, and the y-axis points In these events the following distributions are measured:",

It consists of a silicon pixel detector (pixel), a silicon microstrip detector (SCT) and a transition radiation straw-tube tracker (TRT). These detectors span a sensitive radial distance from the interaction point of 33-150 mm, 299-560 mm and 563-1066 mm respectively, and are situated inside a solenoid that provides a 2 T axial magnetic field. The barrel (each end-cap) consists of four (three) pixel layers, four (nine) double-layers of single-sided silicon microstrips with a 40 mrad stereo angle between the inner and outer part of a double-layer, and 73 (160) layers of TRT straws. The innermost pixel layer, the insertable B-layer (IBL) [11], was added between Run 1 and Run 2 of the LHC, around a new narrower (radius of 25 mm) and thinner beam pipe. It is composed of 14 lightweight staves arranged in a cylindrical geometry, each made of 12 silicon planar sensors in its central region and 2 \u00d7 4 3D sensors at the ends. The IBL pixel dimensions are 50 \u00d7 250 \u03bcm 2 in the \u03c6 and z directions (compared with 50 \u00d7 400 \u03bcm 2 for other pixel layers). The smaller radius and the reduced pixel size result in improvements of both the transverse and longitudinal impact parameter resolutions. In addition, new services have been implemented which significantly reduce the material at the boundaries of the active tracking volume. A track from a charged particle traversing the barrel detector typically has 12 silicon measurement points (hits), of which four are pixel and eight SCT, and more than 30 TRT straw hits.",

The MBTS are mounted at each end of the detector in front of the liquid-argon end-cap calorimeter cryostats at z = \u00b13.56 m and segmented into two rings in pseudorapidity (2.07 < |\u03b7| < 2.76 and 2.76 < |\u03b7| < 3.86).

Fig. 1(a) shows the average number of silicon hits as a function of \u03b7. There is reasonably good agreement, although discrepancies of up to 2% (in the end-caps) are seen; however, these have a small effect on the track reconstruction efficiency. The discrepancies are due to differences between data and simulation in the number of operational detector elements and an imperfect description of the amount of detector material between the pixel detector and the SCT. The impact on the results of these discrepancies is discussed in Section 6.3. Fig. 1(b) shows the fraction of tracks with a given number of IBL hits per track. There is a difference of 0.5% between data and simulation in the fraction of tracks with zero IBL hits, coming predominantly from a difference in the rate of tracks from secondary particles, which is discussed in more detail in Section 5. 4 A hit is expected if the extrapolated track crosses an active region of a pixel module that has not been disabled.",

These particles are due to hadronic interactions, photon conversions and decays of long-lived particles. There is also a contribution of less than 0.1% from fake tracks (those formed by a random combination of hits or from a combination of hits from several particles); these are neglected. The contribution of tracks from secondary particles is estimated using simulation predictions for the shapes of the d BL 0 distributions for tracks from primary and secondary particles satisfying all track selection criteria except the one on d BL 0 . These predictions form templates that are fit to the data in order to extract the relative contribution of tracks from secondary particles. The Gaussian core of the distribution is dominated by the tracks from primary particles, with a width determined by their d BL 0 resolution; tracks from secondary particles dominate the tails. The fit is performed in the region 4 < |d BL 0 | < 9.5 mm, in order to reduce the dependence on the description of the d BL 0 resolution, which affects the core of the distribution. From the fit, it was determined that the fraction of tracks from secondary particles in simulation needs to be scaled by a factor 1.38 \u00b1 0.14. This indicates that (2.3 \u00b1 0.6)% of tracks satisfying the final track selection criteria (|d BL 0 | < 1.5 mm) originate from secondary particles, where systematic uncertainties are dominant and are discussed below. Of these tracks 6% come from photon conversions and the rest from hadronic interactions or long-lived decays. The description of the \u03b7 and p T dependence of this contribution is modelled sufficiently accurately by the simulation that no additional correction is required. Fig. 1(c) shows the d BL 0 distribution for data compared to the simulation with the fraction of tracks from secondary particles scaled to the fitted value. A small disagreement is observed in the core of the d BL 0 distribution. This has no impact in the tail of the distribution used for the fit. The dominant systematic uncertainty stems from the interpolation of the number of tracks from secondary particles from the fit region to the region |d BL 0 | < 1.5 mm. Different generators are used to estimate the interpolation and differences between data and simulation in the shape of the d BL 0 distribution in the fit region are considered. Additional, much smaller, systematic uncertainties arise from a variation of the fit range, considering the \u03b7 dependence of the fitted fractions and from using special simulation samples with varying amounts of detector material.",

Reconstructed tracks from these particles are treated as background and are subtracted. The fraction of reconstructed tracks coming from strange baryons is estimated from simulation with epos to be (0.01 \u00b1 0.01)% on average, with the fraction increasing with track p T to be (3 \u00b1 1)% above 20 GeV.

The material within the ID was studied extensively during Run 1 [29], where the amount of material was known to within \u00b15%. This gives rise to a systematic uncertainty in the track reconstruction efficiency of \u00b10.6% (\u00b11.2%) in the most central (forward) region. Between Run 1 and Run 2 the IBL was installed, the simulation of which must therefore be studied with the Run 2 data. Two data-driven methods are used: a study of secondary vertices from photon conversions (\u03b3 \u2192 e + e \u2212 ) and a study of secondary vertices from hadronic interactions, where the radial position of the vertex is measured with good precision. Comparisons between data and simulation indicate that the material in the IBL is constrained to within \u00b110%. This leads to an uncertainty in the track reconstruction efficiency of \u00b10.1% (\u00b10.2%) in the central (forward) region. This uncertainty is added linearly to the uncertainty from constraints from Run 1, to cover the possibility of missing material in the simulation in both cases. The resulting uncertainty is added in quadrature to the uncertainty from the data-driven correction. The total uncertainty due to the imperfect knowledge of the detector material is \u00b10.7% in the most central region and \u00b11.5% in the most forward region.",

For the n ch distribution, where the track weights are not explicitly applied, the effects from uncertainties in these sources are found by modifying the distribution of selected tracks in data. In each multiplicity interval tracks are randomly removed or added with probabilities dependent on the uncertainties in the track weights of tracks populating that bin. This modified distribution is then unfolded and the deviation from the nominal n ch distribution is taken as a systematic uncertainty. An uncertainty from the fact that the correction procedure, when applied to simulated events, does not reproduce exactly the distribution from generated particles (non-closure) is included in all measurements. An additional systematic uncertainty in the measured p T distribution arises from possible biases and degradation in the p T measurement. This is quantified by comparing the track hit residuals in data and simulation. The effectiveness of the track-fit \u03c7 2 probability selection in suppressing tracks reconstructed with high momentum but originating from low momentum particles was also considered; it was found that the fraction of these tracks remaining was consistent with predictions from simulation. An uncertainty due to the statistical precision of the check is included for the p T distribution. Uncertainty sources that also affect N ev partially cancel in the final distributions.

In most regions of all distributions the dominant uncertainty comes from the track reconstruction efficiency. The results are compared to predictions of models tuned to a wide range of measurements. The measured distributions are presented as inclusive distributions with corrections that rely minimally on the MC model used, in order to facilitate an accurate comparison with predictions. Fig. 3(a) shows the multiplicity of charged particles as a function of pseudorapidity. The mean particle density is roughly constant at 2.9 for |\u03b7| < 1.0 and decreases at higher values of |\u03b7|. epos describes the data for |\u03b7| < 1.0, and predicts a slightly larger multiplicity at larger |\u03b7| values. qgsjet-ii and pythia 8 monash predict Fig. 3. Primary-charged-particle multiplicities as a function of (a) pseudorapidity, \u03b7, and (b) transverse momentum, p T ; (c) the multiplicity, n ch , distribution and (d) the mean transverse momentum, p T , versus n ch in events with n ch \u2265 1, p T > 500 MeV and |\u03b7| < 2.5.

The vertical bars represent the statistical uncertainties, while the shaded areas show statistical and systematic uncertainties added in quadrature. The bottom panel in each figure shows the ratio of the MC simulation to data. Since the bin centroid is different for data and simulation, the values of the ratio correspond to the averages of the bin content. multiplicities that are too large by approximately 15% and 5% respectively. pythia 8 a2 predicts a multiplicity that is 3% too low in the central region, but describes the data well in the forward region. Fig. 3(b) shows the charged-particle transverse momentum distribution. epos describes the data well over the entire p T spectrum. The pythia 8 tunes describe the data reasonably well, but are slightly above the data in the high-p T region. qgsjet-ii gives a poor prediction over the entire spectrum, overshooting the data in the low-p T region and undershooting it in the high-p T region. Fig. 3(c) shows the charged-particle multiplicity distribution. The high-n ch region has significant contributions from events with numerous MPI. pythia 8 a2 describes the data in the region n ch < 50, but predicts too few events at larger n ch values. pythia 8 monash, epos and qgsjet-ii describe the data reasonably well in the region n ch < 30 but predict too many events in the mid-n ch region, with pythia 8 monash and epos predicting too few events in the region n ch > 100 while qgsjet-ii continues to be above the data. Fig. 3(d) shows the mean transverse momentum versus the charged-particle multiplicity. The p T rises with n ch , from 0.8 to 1.2 GeV. This increase is expected due to colour coherence effects being important in dense parton environments and is modelled by a colour reconnection mechanism in pythia 8 or by the hydrodynamical evolution model used in epos. If the high-n ch region is assumed to be dominated by events with numerous MPI, without colour coherence effects the p T is approximately independent of n ch . Including colour coherence effects leads to fewer additional charged particles produced with every additional MPI, with an equally large p T to be shared among the produced hadrons [31]. epos predicts a slightly lower p T , but describes the dependence on n ch very well. The pythia 8 tunes predict a steeper rise of p T with n ch than the data, predicting lower values in the low-n ch region and higher values in the high-n ch region. qgsjet-ii predicts a p T of \u223c 1 GeV, with very little dependence on n ch ; this is expected as it contains no model for colour coherence effects.",
