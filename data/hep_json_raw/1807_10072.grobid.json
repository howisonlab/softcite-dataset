The minimum bias events were triggered by the coincidence of a signal in the V0 detector and the Silicon Pixel Detector (SPD) of the ITS detector. The analysis has been performed for 0-5, 5-10, 10-20, 20-30, 30-40 and 40-50 % centrality bins determined by the V0 detector. The reconstructed primary vertex along the beam direction is required to lie within \u00b110.0 cm with respect to the center of the ALICE detector. The charged tracks were reconstructed using the TPC detector only. The distance of closest approach (DCA) of a track to the primary vertex in the transverse (DCA xy ) and longitudinal (DCA z ) directions are required to be less than 2.4 cm and 3.2 cm, respectively, to reduce the contamination from secondary tracks emanating from weak decays and from interactions with the detector material. Tracks with a transverse momentum within 0.19 GeV/c < p T < 1.5 GeV/c measured in the pseudo-rapidity range |\u03b7| < 0.8 are selected. Combined information from TPC and TOF is used to identify charged tracks as pions and kaons. All track pairs, which share more than 5% of their total hits in the TPC, are excluded from the analysis. Another selection on the fraction of merged points was used to find the fraction of two tracks (|\u0394\u03b7| < 0.1), which were closer than the average cluster size (3 cm) in the TPC. The merged fraction is defined as the ratio of the number of points for which the distance between the tracks is less than 3 cm to the total number of steps of 3 cm calculated in the considered TPC radius range. The unlike-sign (like-sign) pairs with a merged fraction above 1% ( 7%) were removed. To remove contamination of e \u2212 \u2212 e + pairs originating from \u03b3 conversions, pairs are removed if the invariant mass of pairs with assumed electron mass and the difference of polar angle \u03b4\u03b8 between the tracks was less than 0.002 GeV/c and 0.008 radians, respectively. The uncorrelated pair background is constructed by pairing tracks from different events.",

Using the mentioned source function, one can numerically integrate the Eq. 3with the corresponding wave function (indicating the type of interactions) to calculate the correlation function. The input momentum distributions are taken from real pairs to ensure that the momentum acceptance is same. The calculated correlation is compared to the measured via a \u03c7 2 test. The procedure is repeated for different sets of source parameters to arrive at the best agreement with the measured data. In this work, the CorrFit software package [6] was used to perform the numerical fitting described above and extract the experimental R out and \u03bc out . The right plot in Fig. 2 shows the pion-kaon source size and emission asymmetry as a function of the cube root of charged particle multiplicity density in Pb\u2212Pb collisions at \u221a s NN = 2.76 TeV. One observes that the system size increases from peripheral to central events. The extracted emission asymmetry is also observed to increase with particle multiplicity and is negative. This implies that pions are emitted closer to the centre of the source. The results are compared to the predictions from the Therminator2 model [7] with the default calculations and calculations with selected values of time delay for kaon emission [8]. This was motivated by the recent measurements of identical kaon femtoscopy which showed that kaons are emitted, on average, 2.1 fm/c later than pions. The default Therminator2 calculations overpredict the experimental data while an introduction of a time delay of 2.1 fm/c in kaon emission decreases the asymmetry and is in good agreement with the experimental measurement.",
