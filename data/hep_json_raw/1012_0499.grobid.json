            "text": "The COMPASS fixed-target experiment at CERN SPS is dedicated to the study of hadron structure and dynamics. In the physics programme using hadron beams, the focus is on the detection of new states, in particular the search for J P C exotic states and glueballs. After a short pilot run in 2004 (190 GeV/c negative pion beam, lead target), we started our hadron spectroscopy programme in 2008 by collecting an unprecedented statistics with a negative hadron beam (190 GeV/c) on a liquid hydrogen target. A similar amount of data with positive hadron beam (190 GeV/c) has been taken in 2009, as well as some additional data with negative beam on nuclear targets. The spectrometer features a large angular acceptance and high momentum resolution and also good coverage by electromagnetic calorimetry, crucial for the detection of final states involving \u03c0 0 or \u03b7. A first important result is the observation of a significant J P C spin exotic signal consistent with the disputed \u03c01(1600) in the pilot run data. This result was recently published. We present an overview of the status of various ongoing analyses on the 2008/09 data.",

            "text": "The existence of exotic states beyond the constituent quark model (CQM) has been speculated about almost since the introduction of colour [1,2]. Due to the self-coupling of gluons via colourcharge, so-called hybrid mesons and glueball are allowed within Quantum Chromodynamics while they are beyond the CQM. Hybrid mesons are qq states with an admixture of gluons, and glueballs are states with no quark content, only consisting of (constituent) gluons. According to Lattice-QCD predictions [3], the glueball candidate lowest in mass has scalar quantum numbers, J P C = 0 ++ , and is expected to have a mass of \u223c 1.7 GeV/c 2 . A glueball candidate has been observed by the Crystal Barrel and the WA102 experiments, however, mixing with ordinary isoscalar mesons makes the interpretation difficult. Several light hybrids, on the other hand, are predicted to have exotic J P C quantum numbers and are thus promising candidates in the search for physics beyond the CQM. The lowest mass hybrid candidate for example is predicted [4] to have exotic quantum numbers of spin, parity and charge conjugation J P C = 1 \u2212+ not attainable by ordinary qq states, and a mass between 1.3 and 2.2 GeV/c 2 .",

            "text": "Two experimentally observed 1 \u2212+ hybrid candidates in the light-quark sector have been reported in the past in different decay channels, the \u03c0 1 (1400) mainly seen in \u03b7\u03c0 decays, by e.g. E852 [5], VES [6], and Crystal Barrel [7], and the \u03c0 1 (1600), observed by both E852 and VES in the decay channels: \u03c1\u03c0 [8,9], \u03b7 \u03c0 [6,10], f 1 \u03c0 [11,12], and \u03c9\u03c0\u03c0 [12,13]. In particular the resonant nature of the \u03c1\u03c0 decay channel of the \u03c0 1 (1600) observed in 3\u03c0 final states is highly disputed [12,14]. COMPASS has started to shed new light on the puzzle of spin-exotics by the observation of an 1 \u2212+ signal in the 2004 data, consistent with the famous \u03c0 1 (1600). It shows clean phase motions with respect to other waves, confirming the resonance nature [15].",

Photon detection in a wide angular range at high resolution is crucial for decay channels involving \u03c0 0 , \u03b7 or \u03b7 , The Ring Imaging Cherenkov (RICH) detector in the first stage allows for final state particle identification (PID). A good separation of pions from kaons enables the study of kaonic final states. Two Cherenkov Differential counters with Acromatic Ring focus (CEDAR) upstream of the target are used to identify the incoming beam particle. Not only production of strangeness with the pion beam can thus be studied but also kaon diffraction, tagging the kaon contribution in the negative hadron beam (96 % \u03c0 \u2212 , 3.5 % K \u2212 , 0.5 %p). After a short pilot run in 2004 of 190 GeV/c \u03c0 \u2212 beam on a lead target (Sec. 2.1), COMPASS recorded data with 190 GeV/c hadron beams in 2008/09, providing excellent opportunity for simultaneous observation of new states in various decay modes within the same experiment (Sec. 2.2, 2.3). Moreover, the data contain subsets with Figure 2.

The resonance X \u2212 decays via an intermediate di-pion resonance (the isobar), accompanied by a so-called bachelor pion. The PWA method consists of two steps. First, a mass-independent fit is performed on the data binned into 40 MeV/c 2 wide mass intervals, no assumption on the resonance structure of the 3\u03c0 system is made at this level. A total set of 42 waves including a flat background wave is fitted to the data using an extended maximum likelihood method, which comprises acceptance corrections. Subsequently, the mass-dependent fit is applied to the six main waves out of the result from the first step, and uses a \u03c7 2 minimisation. The mass dependence is parameterised by relativistic Breit-Wigners (BW) and coherent background, if present. The employed parameterisation of the spin density matrix has a rank of two, accounting for spin-flip and spin-non-flip amplitudes at the baryon vertex. Fig. 3 shows the intensity of the 1 ++ wave with the well-established a 1 (1260) and that of the spin-exotic 1 \u2212+ wave as well as the phase difference \u2206\u03a6 between the two, for the fits of all six waves, see [15]. The black data points represent the mass-independent fit, whereas the mass-independent one is overlayed as solid line, the separation into background (dotted) and BW (dashed) is plotted where applicable. Especially the resonant nature of the exotic 1 \u2212+ 1 + [\u03c1\u03c0]P wave is questioned in previous observations, whereas our data shows a clear and rapid phase motion. Our result of a mass of 1660 \u00b1 10 +0 \u221264 MeV/c 2 and a width of 269 \u00b1 21 +42 \u221264 MeV/c 2 is consistent with the famous \u03c0 1 (1600) [15] already reported in the past but still controversially discussed.",

The relative contribution should follow isospin conservation, depending on the underlying isobars, as it is shown in Fig. 4. A first partialwave analysis (PWA) of main waves in diffractively produced 3\u03c0 events has been performed for both modes, applying the same model as for the 2004 result, for details see [19]. The wave intensities shown are normalised in the same way to the well-known \u03c1\u03c0 decay of the a 2 (1320) to compensate for the different statistics analysed, thus making them comparable. We find similar intensities for the \u03c1\u03c0 decay, whereas a suppression factor of two is observed for the wave decaying into f 2 \u03c0 as expected due to the Clebsch-Gordon coefficients.
