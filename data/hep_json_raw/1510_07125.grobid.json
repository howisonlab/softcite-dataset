The quantum theory of Ms and its consistency with electrodynamics was derived by P.A.M. Dirac. This marked the start of the searches for classical monopoles at every new accelerator, up to the LHC. Magnetic monopoles are required by Grand Unification Theories, but unlike classical monopoles they would be incredibly massive, out of the reach of any conceivable accelerator. Large efforts have been made to search for them in the cosmic radiation as relic particles from the early Universe in the widest range of mass and velocity experimentally accessible.",

The symmetry would not be perfect, since the unit magnetic charge is much larger than the electric one. Eq. 1 defines most of the properties of Dirac (or classical) magnetic monopoles, as they are assumed as point-like particles. Around 1974 it was realized [2,3] that the electric charge is naturally quantized in Grand Unification Theories (GUTs) of the strong and electroweak interactions. Ms appear at the phase transition corresponding to the spontaneous breaking of the unified group into subgroups, one of which is U (1), which describes electromagnetism. In a certain sense, the situation was reversed compared to the reasoning of Dirac: the quantization of the electric charge now implied the existence of magnetic monopoles.",

Through these bosons the strong and EW interactions between particles are indistinguishable: quarks and leptons are, in this domain, the same particles. The M's core should be surrounded by a fermion-antifermion condensate. The condensate would have baryon number violating terms (see \u00a7II A 3) extending up to the confinement region. Fig. 1 shows the structure of a GUT M: a very small core, an electroweak region, a confinement region, a fermion-antifermion condensate (which may contain four-fermion agglomerates that induce baryon number violating processes). For r \u2265 3 fm a GUT M behaves as a point particle generating a field B = g/r 2 .",

The contribution from bremsstrahlung is small and is usually neglected. Theoretical uncertainties arising from the large coupling constant \u03b1 m should be considered in the computation of transition probabilities. Thus, the energy loss per unit path length in this energy regime is dominated by single (or small numbers) of collisions with the possibility of a large energy transfer, leading to large fluctuations on the stopping power and range of the particle. This velocity range is of particular interest because of the considerations given in \u00a7II A for massive Ms bound to astrophysical systems. In the calculation of the energy loss the materials is approximated by a free (degenerate) gas of electrons. This is appropriate in the description of M's interactions with the conduction electrons of metallic absorbers. For nonmetallic absorbers it represents a reasonable approximation for heavy atoms (Z \u2265 10). Using this approximation, Ahlen and Kinoshita [32] have computed the stopping power in the velocity range 10 \u22123 \u03b2 10 \u22122 as:",

The detection method consists in a superconducting coil coupled to a SQUID (Superconducting Quantum Interferometer Device). A moving M induces in a superconducting ring an electromotive force and a current change (\u2206i). For a coil with N turns and inductance L the current change is \u2206i = 4\u03c0N ng D /L = 2\u2206i o , where i o is the current change corresponding to a change of one unit of the flux quantum of superconductivity. This method is based only on the long-range electromagnetic interaction between the magnetic charge and the macroscopic quantum state of a superconducting ring. For any sample of matter containing only magnetic dipoles, induced currents cancel out to zero after its passage through the coil. A persistent current directly proportional to g D would represent an unmistakable signature of the M's passage. Induction coils are the only known device sensitive only to the magnetic charge, so able to detect poles of any velocity and mass. The system components, in particular the magnetometer, have to be extremely well shielded from any variation of the ambient magnetic field.

Due to the coupling between the pole magnetic field and the electron magnetic moment, the atomic energy levels are changed by the passage of a slowly moving magnetic charge, and an electron can make a transition to an excited level. The energy levels of the atom split in the characteristic Zeeman pattern. The M's energy loss can be observed in the form of subsequent electromagnetic radiation when the excited electrons return to their ground states. The Drell mechanism is effective as long as the monopole-atom collision energy exceeds the spacing of atomic levels. The effect may be used for practical detection either by observing photons emitted in the de-excitation of atoms or by observing the ionization caused by the energy transfer from the excited atoms to complex molecules with a low ionization potential (the Penning effect). Helium plus n-pentane (C 5 H 12 ) was used for this purpose in the MACRO streamer tube sub-system, \u00a7V C. The results of the calculations performed in [36] for different values of the magnetic charge g are shown in Fig. 4b), by curves labeled with C.",

NTDs are sensitive to the fraction of the energy loss released in a narrow region close to the particle's trajectory. In polymers like CR39 R or Makrofol R /Lexan TM the restricted energy loss (REL) is the relevant quantity. At high M velocities (\u03b2 > 0.05) the REL excludes the energy transfers resulting in energetic \u03b4-rays and thus in energy deposited far away from the track [38]. At lower M velocities (\u03b2 < 10 \u22122 ), elastic recoils from diamagnetic interactions between the M and the atoms have to be considered. A detailed computation of these energy loss mechanisms are in [36] and the REL as a function of \u03b2 is shown in Fig. 5. The atomic elastic recoil contribution gives rise to a bump in REL below \u03b2 \u223c 10 \u22123 .",

By chemical etching, two regular etch-pit cones are formed on each side of the detector sheet along the track of a crossing particle. The REL may be determined from the geometry of the etched cones. For CR39 this technique is particularly successful, yielding measurements of the electric charge of heavy relativistic nuclei (Z > 5) to a precision of 0.05e if several layers of plastic sheets are used [39,40].",

In the searches for Ms in cosmic rays, several loops in coincidence are needed to avoid spurious signals. The major drawbacks are the cost of the superconductive loops with the required sensitivity, their small effective area (up to a square meter) and the fact that such devices cannot be easily operated in any environment. A number of searches using apparata with different number of loops (see for instance [76,77]) set a combined flux upper limit of \u223c 4 \u00d7 10 \u221213 cm \u22122 sr \u22121 s \u22121 (out of the scale of Fig. 7).

The MACRO experiment at Gran Sasso MACRO (Monopole Astrophysics and Cosmic Ray Observatory) [78] was a large multipurpose underground detector located in the Hall B of the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso (Italy). At Gran Sasso the minimum thickness of the rock overburden is 3150 hg/cm 2 and the cosmic muon flux is reduced to \u223c 1 m \u22122 h \u22121 , almost a factor 10 6 smaller than at the surface. The detector, which took data with different configurations from 1989 to December 2000, was optimized for the search for GUT magnetic monopoles with velocity \u03b2 \u2265 4 \u00d7 10 \u22125 . The large area apparatus had global dimensions of 76.6 \u00d7 12 \u00d7 9.3 m 3 , and \u223c 10, 000 m 2 sr acceptance to an isotropic particle flux. Redundancy and complementarity were the primary features in designing the experiment, because reasonably very few Ms during the detector lifetime were expected. To accomplish this, the apparatus consisted of three independent sub-detectors: liquid scintillation counters, limited streamer tubes, each of them with dedicated and independent hardware, and nuclear track detectors. MACRO was a multipurpose detector, able to address different cosmic ray physics items, as the disappearance of atmospheric \u03bd \u00b5 , interpreted as due to neutrino oscillations [79].",

Multiple analysis strategies were adopted, where both the M signatures and the background characteristics were took into account. Fast Ms were looked for in the active detectors via their large energy releases in the liquid scintillator [80] and in the limited streamer tube [81] systems. The background was mainly due to high-energy muons with or without an accompanying electromagnetic shower. Slow magnetic monopoles should leave small signals spread over a large time window [82]; a \u03b2 \u223c 10 \u22124 monopole would have had a time-of-flight across the detector as large as about 1 ms. This implied the use of specific analysis procedures that allowed the rejection of the background mainly due to radioactivity induced hits and possible electronic noise. The final result was obtained by a proper combination of flux upper limits from different searches, as reported in [63].",

Lexan has a much higher threshold making it sensitive to Ms with \u03b2 > 0.1. After about 9.5 y of exposure, the top CR39 foils in each stack were etched and analyzed. The signal looked for was a hole or a biconical track with the two base cone areas equal within experimental uncertainties. An efficiency close to 100% for finding a signal was achieved. The signature of the passage of a M was a coincidence among different CR39 layers.

NTDs are relatively cheap detectors that can cover very large surfaces. The disadvantage of NTDs is that they require chemical etching and optical scanning to extract the signal. Solid state breakdown counters, that exhibit high registration dE/dx thresholds, may offer an alternative to NTDs, providing in addition the convenience of electronic registration and simplicity of fabrication, operation, and signal extraction. These properties make such technique a viable one to search for Ms and other highly ionizing rare particles [107].",

These systems are called \"emergent particles\" or \"quasiparticles\". In January 2014 the synthesis of a Dirac monopole quasiparticle in a spinor Bose-Einstein condensate was reported. It was obtained by using an external magnetic field to guide the spins of the atoms forming the condensate [110]. The attention aroused by such findings as well as the many searches performed, those planned, and the abundant theoretical literature indicate the persistent lively interest on the possible existence of the magnetic monopole. As Dirac, still many people today \"would be surprised if Nature had made no use of it\" ([1], pag. 71).",
