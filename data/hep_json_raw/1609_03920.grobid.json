It is important to measure all accessible Standard Model (SM) processes at the new centre-of-mass energy, compare the results to the corresponding theoretical SM predictions, and look for deviations which might result from energy-dependent non-SM couplings. In this article, inclusive cross-section measurements of the dominant single-top-quark production mechanism are presented.",

The dominant process is the t-channel exchange depicted in figure 1, which is the subject of the measurements presented in this article. A light quark from one of the colliding protons interacts with a b-quark from another proton by exchanging a virtual W boson. Since the valence u-quark density of the proton is about twice as high as the valence d-quark density, the production cross-section of single top-quarks \u03c3(tq) is expected to be higher than the cross-section of top-antiquark production \u03c3(tq). At LO, the subleading single-top-quark processes are the associated production of a W boson and a top quark (Wt) and the s-channel production of tb andtb.",

            "text": "In general, measurements of single top-quark production provide insights into the properties of the Wtb vertex. The cross-sections are proportional to the square of the coupling at the production vertex. In the SM, the coupling is given by the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix element V tb [3,4] multiplied by the universal electroweak coupling constant. Non-SM contributions can be encapsulated by an additional left-handed form factor f LV [5], assumed to be real. The sensitivity for these non-SM contributions could be increased for the higher centre-of-mass energy, if there is new physics at high scales. The combined cross-section \u03c3(tq +tq) is determined as the sum of \u03c3(tq) and \u03c3(tq) and used to determine f LV \u2022 |V tb |. All measurements presented in this paper are based on the assumption that the production and the decay of top quarks via Wts and Wtd vertices is suppressed due to the fact that the CKM matrix elements V ts and V td are much smaller than V tb . Currently, the most precise determination of f LV \u2022 |V tb | has an uncertainty of 4 %, obtained from a combination of measurements performed by the CMS Collaboration [6] under the same assumption as the one stated above.",

These predictions have been calculated for a top-quark mass of 172.5 GeV at next-to-leading order (NLO) [7] in perturbative QCD using Hathor v2.1 [8]. The uncertainties connected with PDFs and the strong coupling constant, \u03b1 s , are calculated using the PDF4LHC prescription [9] with the MSTW2008 NLO [10,11], CT10 NLO [12] and NNPDF 2.3 NLO [13] PDF sets, and are added in quadrature to the scale uncertainty. The cross-sections of all three single-top-quark production processes have also been calculated at approximate nextto-next-to-leading-order (NNLO) precision [14][15][16]. NNLO results are available for the t-channel cross-section [17] and the NNLO/NLO K-factor is 0.985.

This article is organised as follows. Section 2 gives an overview of the data and simulated event samples that are used in the analysis. The definitions of physics objects are given in section 3 and the event selection criteria as well as the definition of the signal and validation regions are presented in section 4.

Section 6 discusses the discriminating variables and the training and the performance of the NN used to improve the measurement sensitivity, while in section 7 the estimation of systematic uncertainties is discussed.

The inner tracking detector (ID) covers the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 2.5. It consists of silicon pixel, silicon microstrip, and transition-radiation tracking detectors. The innermost layer of the pixel detector, the insertable B-layer [21], was added between Run 1 (2009-2013) and Run 2 of the LHC at a radius of 33 mm around a new and thinner beam pipe. Lead/liquid-argon (LAr) sampling calorimeters provide electromagnetic (EM) energy measurements with high granularity. A hadron (iron/scintillator-tile) calorimeter covers the central pseudorapidity range (|\u03b7| < 1.7). The endcap and forward regions are instrumented with LAr calorimeters for both the EM and hadronic energy measurements up to |\u03b7| = 4.9. The muon spectrometer surrounds the calorimeters and is based on three large air-core toroid superconducting magnets with eight coils each. Its bending power ranges from 2.0 to 7.5 T m. It includes a system of precision tracking chambers and fast detectors JHEP04(2017)086 for triggering. A two-level trigger system [22] is used to select events. The first-level trigger is implemented in hardware and uses a subset of the detector information to reduce the accepted rate to at most 75 kHz. This is followed by a software-based high-level trigger (HLT), which has access to full detector granularity and is used to further reduce the event rate to 1 kHz.",

The parton shower, hadronisation, and the underlying event are modelled using the Pythia 6 (v6.428) [28] generator and the Perugia2012 set of tuned parameters (P2012 tune) [29]. In order to study effects of the choice of parton-shower model, the same events are showered using Herwig++ (v.2.7.1) [30] and the energy-extrapolated underlying event set of tuned parameters (UE-EE-5 tune) [31]. A second NLO generator capable of generating t-channel single-top-quark events in the 4FS is MadGraph5 aMC@NLO [32] (v2.2.2). Samples are generated using the CT10f4 PDF set and \u00b5 r and \u00b5 f are set to be the same as those implemented in Powheg-Box.

For the generation of SM single topquarks in the Wt and the s-channel (tb +tb) the Powheg-Box V1 (r2819) generator [33,34] with the CT10 PDF set is used. Samples of tt events are generated with the Powheg-Box V2 (r3026) [35] and the CT10 PDF set. The h damp parameter, which controls the p T of the first additional emission beyond the Born configuration, where its main effect is to regulate the high-p T emission against which the tt system recoils, is set to the top-quark mass.

Predictions of the s-channel production are calculated at NLO using the same methodology as for the t-channel production and yield a cross-section of 10.3 pb. The predicted tt cross-section is \u03c3 tt = 831.8 pb.

Diboson events are normalised to the NLO cross-section provided by the Sherpa generator. The matrix method [43] is used to determine the multijet background in the electron channel. This method estimates the number of multijet background events in the signal region by applying efficiency factors to the number of events passing the signal tight and a loose lepton selection, the former selection being a subset of the latter. The number of multijet events N tight fake passing the signal requirements can be expressed as where real and fake are the efficiencies for real and fake loose leptons being selected as tight leptons, N loose is the number of selected events in the loose sample, and N tight is the number of selected events in the signal sample. The fake-lepton efficiencies are determined from a data sample dominated by non-prompt and fake-lepton background events. This sample is selected by requiring exactly one loose lepton and low E miss T as well as low m T ( E miss T ).

A large number of potential input variables were studied, including kinematic variables of the identified physics objects, as well as variables obtained from the reconstruction of the W boson and the top quark. A detailed description of the algorithm including the reconstruction of the longitudinal component of the neutrino momentum is given in ref. [19]. As a compromise between the discrimination power and the need for a manageable number of variables, the ten highest-ranking show the m(l\u03bdb) and m( jb) distributions in the W+jets VR and tt VR for the + channel. In the tt VR the b-jet used to calculate m(l\u03bdb) and m( jb) is the b-jet with the higher p T . The distributions from the different processes, apart from the multijet background in the electron channel, are normalised to match the number of observed events. In the case of the electron channel, the relative contribution of each simulated process is estimated using its predicted cross-section. In the case of the muon channel, the distributions are normalised to the expected number of events obtained from the fit to the m T ( E miss T ) distributions described in section 5. Satisfactory agreement is seen between the data and the predictions.",
