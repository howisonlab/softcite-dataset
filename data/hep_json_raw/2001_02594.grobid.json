COMPASS will measure DVCS and DVMP reactions with a high intensity muon beam of 160 GeV and a 2.5 m-long liquid hydrogen target surrounded by a new TOF system. The availability of muon beams with high energy and opposite charge and polarization will allow to access the Compton form factor related to the dominant GPD H and to study the x B -dependence of the t-slope of the pure DVCS cross section and to study nucleon tomography. Projections on the achievable accuracies and preliminary results of pilot measurements will be presented.",

            "text": "Generalised Parton Distributions (GPDs) [1,2,3,4,5] contain the currently most complete information on the nucleon structure. A GPD can be considered as a momentumdissected form-factor providing information on the transverse localisation of a parton as function of the fraction it carries of the nucleon's longitudinal momentum. Hence they embody both the form factors observed in elastic scattering and the parton distribution functions measured in deeply inelastic scattering. GPDs provide a sort of \"3D picture\" of the nucleon often referred as \"nucleon tomography\". Moreover it has been shown [2] that the total angular momentum of partons can be accessed via the second moment of the sum of the GPDs H and E. The study of exclusive reactions like Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering (DVCS) and Deeply Virtual Meson Production (DVMP) is one of the most promising ways to experimentally constrain the GPDs. Measurements of those processes have been performed or are planned at JLab [6,7,8], DESY (HER-MES [9,10], H1 [11,12] and ZEUS [13]) and CERN (COMPASS-II) [14]. COMPASS-II will cover the kinematics domain from x B \u223c 5 \u00d7 10 \u22123 to about 0.1, which cannot be explored by any other existing or planned facility in the near future (see figure 1).",

The experimental apparatus [15] is being upgraded with a new electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL0) and a 4 m-long recoil proton detector (CAMERA) surrounding a 2.5 m-long liquidhydrogen target. The ECAL0 will extend the angular acceptance for exclusive photons and increase the accessible x B domain to substantially higher values compared to the present set-up. The CAMERA detector on the other end will ensure the exclusivity of DVCS and DVMP by detecting the recoil protons. ",

DVCS competes with the Bethe-Heitler (BH) process, which is elastic lepton-nucleon scattering with a hard photon emitted by either the incoming or outgoing lepton.
