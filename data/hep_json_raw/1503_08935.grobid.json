In order to equalise the beam flux through all target cells, the extrapolated beam track is required to pass all of them. The measured longitudinal position of the vertex allows us to identify the target cell in which the scattering occurred. The radial distance of the vertex from the beam axis is required to be less than 1.9 cm, by which the contribution of unpolarised material is minimised. All physics triggers, inclusive and semi-inclusive ones, are included in this analysis. In order to be attributed to the scattered muon, a track is required to pass more than 30 radiation lengths of material and it has to point to the hodoscopes that have triggered the event. In order to select the DIS region, only events with photon virtuality Q 2 > 1 (GeV/c) 2 are selected. In addition, the relative muon energy transfer, y, is required to be between 0.1 and 0.9.

The effective dilution factor f is given by the ratio of the total cross section for muons on polarisable protons to the one on all nuclei in the target, whereby their measured composition is taken into account. It is modified by a correction factor that accounts for the dilution due to radiative events on unpolarised protons [9]. The target polarisation is not included in the event weight, because it may change in time and generate false asymmetries. The obtained asymmetries are corrected for spin-dependent radiative effects according to Ref. [10] and for the 14 N polarisation as described in Refs. [3,11]. It has been checked in the same binning as for the asymmetry determination that the use of semi-inclusive triggers does not bias the determination of A  Table 1, which also shows the additive contributions. The largest additive contribution to the systematic uncertainty is the one from possible false asymmetries. Their size is estimated with two different approaches. In the first approach, the central target cell is artificially divided into two consecutive 30 cm long parts. Calculating the asymmetry using the two outer cells or the two central parts, the physics asymmetry cancels and thus two independent false asymmetries are formed. Both are found to be consistent with zero. This test was done using the same sub-samples as for the physics asymmetries determination. In order to check for a false asymmetry due to time-dependent effects, the asymmetries A p 1 obtained from these sub-samples are compared by using the method of \"pulls\" [12]. No significant broadening of pull distributions is observed. These pulls are used to set an upper limit on the systematic uncertainty due to false asymmetries A false , which is due to spin-dependent radiative effects. The total systematic uncertainty is given by the quadratic sum of the contributions in Table 1.

The new data improve the kinematic coverage in the region of high Q 2 and low x values, which gives a better lever arm for the determination of quark and gluon polarisations from the DGLAP evolution equations.

The quark singlet distribution q S (x), the quark non-singlet distributions q 3 (x) and q 8 (x), as well as the gluon helicity distribution g(x), which appear in the NLO expressions for g p 1 , g n 1 and g N 1 (see e.g. Ref. [17]), are parametrised at a reference scale Q 2 0 as follows: to describe the data. The exponent \u03b2 g , which is not well determined from the data, is fixed to 3.0225 [28] and the uncertainty from the introduced bias is included in the final uncertainty. This leaves 11 free parameters in the fitted parton distributions. The expression for \u03c7 2 of the fit consists of three terms,",

The dark error bands seen in this figure stem from generating several sets of g 1 pseudo-data, which are obtained by randomising the measured g 1 values using their statistical uncertainties according to a normal distribution. This corresponds to a one-standard-deviation accuracy of the extracted parton distributions. A thorough analysis of systematic uncertainties of the fitting procedure is performed. The most important source is the freedom in the choice of the functional forms for The inclusion of systematic uncertainties in the fit leads to much larger spreads in the first moments as compared to those obtained by only propagating statistical uncertainties.

The various contributions are listed in Table 7 and the dependence of NS 1 on the lower limit of the integral is shown in Fig. 8. The contribution of the measured x range to the integral corresponds to 93.8% of the full first moment, while the extrapolation to 0 and 1 amounts to 3.6% and 2.6%, respectively. Compared to the previous result [3], the contribution of the extrapolation to x = 0 is now by about one third smaller than before due to the larger x range of the present data. The value of the integral for the full x range is NS 1 = 0.181 \u00b1 0.008 (stat.) \u00b1 0.014 (syst.).  The total uncertainty of NS 1 is dominated by the systematic uncertainty, which is calculated using the same contributions as used for the values in Table 5. The largest contribution stems from the uncertainty of the beam polarisation (5%); other contributions originate from uncertainties in the combined proton data, i.e. those of target polarisation, dilution factor and depolarisation factor. The uncertainties in the deuteron data have a smaller impact as the first moment of g d 1 is smaller than that of the proton. The uncertainty due to the evolution to a common Q 2 is found to be negligible when varying Q 2 0 between 1 (GeV/c) 2 and 10 (GeV/c) 2 . The overall result agrees well with our earlier result NS 1 = 0.190 \u00b1 0.009 \u00b1 0.015 in Ref. [3].",
