Focus is given to exploiting the impact of strong matter effects on the oscillation of atmospheric neutrinos in light of expanded models, such as sterile neutrinos and non-standard interactions. In the presence of light sterile neutrinos that mix with active neutrinos, additional resonances and suppressions may occur at different energies. One may also use neutrino oscillations to probe the properties of the coherent forward scattering which may be altered by new interactions beyond the Standard Model. Preliminary studies show that ORCA would be able to probe some parameters of these models with sensitivity up to one order of magnitude better than current constraints.",

            "text": "ORCA is one of the detectors in the KM3NeT project which are currently under construction in the Mediterranean Sea with the goals of measuring the Neutrino Mass Hierarchy (NMH), and searching for astrophysical high energy neutrino sources [1]. The ORCA detector will be densely instrumented with 2070 optical modules separated from each other by 9 m vertically and 20m horizontally, to enable the study of atmospheric neutrinos ranging from a few GeV to \u223c100 GeV. In this energy range, refraction in the matter of the earth significantly alters the effective neutrino flavour mixing. These matter effects can generate resonant neutrino flavour transitions which are the main driver of ORCA's sensitivity to the NMH. The impact of strong matter effects may also be exploited to search for new physics phenomena. With an effective mass of 5.7 Mton, ORCA will provide unprecedented statistical power in the energy range relevant for the study of resonant neutrino transitions.",

Distortions in the oscillation pattern due to matter effects are expected to occur in specific parts of this energy and direction phase space. Atmospheric neutrinos provide a wide range of energies and baselines (equivalent to direction), which can be used to constrain systematic effects in the regions where matter effects are not expected to occur. This same methodology can be employed to also search for physics beyond the Standard Model, by looking for distortions characteristic of resonant effects in particular models. Since these resonant effects often occur in different parts of the energy-direction phase space, these models can be studied independently of the standard matter effects. Figure 1 shows the regions of this phase space where most of the signal of the NMH, sterile neutrinos, and NSI are expected to appear. Figure 1. Regions of parameter space where 50% of the sensitivity to new physics is expected to be found (Purple) compared to where the sensitivity to the NMH is expected to be found (Green).",

First, detector related effects such as energy and angular resolution, as well as detection efficiency, were incorporated in a parametrised fashion, which does not take into account all possible correlations between these effects. Second, the identification of neutrino flavours was assumed to be perfect. Finally, no systematic effects were considered and all nuisance oscillation parameters were kept fixed at their global best fit values. These assumptions are in general optimistic and a full realistic analysis is currently under development.",

Figure 1 shows the results of the preliminary sensitivities to sterile neutrinos in the |U \u00b54 | 2 \u2212 |U \u03c4 4 | 2 parameter space and to NSI in the \u03c4 \u03c4 \u2212 e\u03c4 parameter space.
