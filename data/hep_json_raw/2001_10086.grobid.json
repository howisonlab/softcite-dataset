The data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 137 fb \u22121 at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, collected in 2016-2018 by the CMS experiment at the LHC. The search is performed using a total of 168 signal regions defined using several kinematic variables. The properties of the events are found to be consistent with the expectations from standard model processes. Exclusion limits at 95% confidence level are set on cross sections for the pair production of gluinos or squarks for various decay scenarios in the context of supersymmetric models conserving or violating R parity. The observed lower mass limits are as large as 2.1 TeV for gluinos and 0.9 TeV for top and bottom squarks. To facilitate reinterpretations, model-independent limits are provided in a set of simplified signal regions.",

            "text": "In SUSY models [11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19], the decay chain of pairproduced gluinos or squarks can contain multiple W or Z bosons, with the potential to have at least one pair of SS W bosons. Such a decay chain is realized, for example in e-mail: cms-publication-committee-chair@cern.ch gluino pair production, when a gluino decays into a top quarkantiquark pair and a neutralino, or into a pair of quarks and a chargino that subsequently decays into a W boson and a neutralino. In R parity [20] conserving (RPC) scenarios, the lightest SUSY particle is neutral and stable and escapes detection, leading to an imbalance in the measured transverse momentum. The magnitude of the missing transverse momentum strongly depends on the details of the model, and in particular on the mass spectrum of the particles involved. Scenarios with R parity violation (RPV) [21,22] additionally allow decays of SUSY particles into SM particles only, leading in many cases to signatures with little or no missing transverse momentum. For many SUSY models, the SS and multilepton signatures provide complementarity with searches in the zero-or one-lepton final states, and they are particularly suitable for probing compressed mass spectra and other scenarios involving low-momentum leptons or low missing transverse momentum. Both the ATLAS [23] and CMS [24,25] Collaborations have carried out searches in these channels using LHC data collected up to and including 2016. The ATLAS Collaboration has also recently released a search with the full data set recorded between 2015 and 2018 [26].",

[24,25] using a larger data set of pp collisions at \u221a s = 13 TeV recorded by the CMS detector at the CERN LHC in 2016-2018, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 137 fb \u22121 . We base our search on an initial selection of events with at least two hadronic jets and two SS or three or more light leptons (electrons and muons), including those from leptonic decays of \u03c4 leptons. Several signal regions (SRs) are then constructed with requirements on variables such as the number of leptons, the number of jets (possibly identified as originating from b quarks), and the magnitude of missing transverse momentum. A simultaneous comparison of the observed and SM plus BSM expected event yields in all SRs is performed to constrain the BSM models described in Sect. 2. After a brief description of the CMS experiment in Sect. 3, we present the details of the search strategy and event selection in Sect. 4 and discuss the various relevant backgrounds from SM processes in Sect. 5. The systematic uncertainties considered in the analysis are presented in Sect. 6. In Sect. 7, the observed yields are compared to the background expectation and the results are interpreted to constrain the various BSM models introduced earlier. Model independent limits are also derived. Finally, the main results are summarized in Sect. 8.",

            "text": "The first scenario, denoted by T1tttt and displayed in Fig. 1a, includes an off-shell top squark (t) leading to the three-body decay of the gluino,g \u2192 tt\u03c7 0 1 , resulting in events with four W bosons and four b quarks. Figure 1b presents a similar model (T5ttbbWW) where the gluino decay results in a chargino that further decays into a neutralino and a W boson. The model shown in Fig. 1c (T5tttt) is the same as T1tttt except that the intermediate top squark is on-shell. The mass splitting between thet and the\u03c7 0 1 is taken to be m\u02dct \u2212 m\u03c70 1 = m t , where m t is the top quark mass. This choice maximizes the kinematic differences between this model and T1tttt, and also corresponds to one of the most challenging regions of parameter space for the observation of th\u1ebd t \u2192 t\u03c7 0 1 decay since the neutralino is produced at rest in the top squark rest frame. The decay chain of Fig. 1d (T5ttcc) is identical to that of T5tttt except that thet decay involves a cquark. In Fig. 1e, the decay process includes a virtual lightflavor squark, leading to three-body decays ofg \u2192 qq \u03c7 \u00b1 1 org \u2192 qq \u03c7 0 2 , with a resulting signature of two W bosons, two Z bosons, or one of each (the case shown in Fig. 2e), and four light-flavor jets. This model, T5qqqqWZ, with a resulting signature of one W boson and one Z boson, is studied with two different assumptions for the chargino mass: m\u03c7\u00b1 1 + 20 GeV, producing on-and off-shell bosons, respectively. The model is also considered with the assumption of decays to two W bosons exclusively (T5qqqqWW). Figure 2a shows a model of bottom squark production with subsequent decay ofb 1 \u2192 t\u03c7 \u00b1 1 , yielding two b quarks and four W bosons. This model, T6ttWW, is considered as a function of the the lightest bottom squark,b 1 , and\u03c7 \u00b1 1 masses. The\u03c7 0 1 mass is fixed to be 50 GeV, causing two of the W bosons to be produced off-shell when the\u03c7 \u00b1 1 mass is less than approximately 130 GeV. Figure 2b displays a model similar to T6ttWW, but with top squark pair production and a subsequent decay oft 2 \u2192t 1 H/Z, witht 1 \u2192 t\u03c7 0 1 , producing signatures with two H bosons, two Z bosons, or one of each. In this model, T6ttHZ, the\u03c7 0 1 mass is fixed such that m(t 1 ) \u2212 m(\u03c7 0 1 ) = m t . The R parity violating decays considered in this analysis are T1qqqqL (Fig. 3a) and T1tbs (Fig. 3b). In T1qqqqL, the gluino decays to the lightest squark (g \u2192qq), which in turn decays to a quark (q \u2192 q\u03c7 0 1 ), but decays with the\u03c7 0 1 off shell (violating R parity) into two quarks and a charged lepton, giving rise to a prompt 5-body decay of the gluino. In T1tbs, each gluino decays into three different SM quarks (a top, a bottom, and a strange quark).",

Within the solenoid volume are a silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL), and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter (HCAL), each composed of a barrel and two endcap sections. Forward calorimeters extend the pseudorapidity (\u03b7) coverage provided by the barrel and endcap detectors. Muons are detected in gas-ionization chambers embedded in the steel flux-return yoke outside the solenoid. A more detailed description of the CMS detector, together with a definition of the coordinate system used and the relevant kinematic variables, can be found in Ref. [59]. Events of interest are selected using a two-tiered trigger system [60]. The first level, composed of custom hardware processors, uses information from the calorimeters and muon detectors to select events at a rate of around 100 kHz within a fixed time interval of less than 4 \u03bcs. The second level, known as the high-level trigger, consists of a farm of processors running a version of the full event reconstruction software optimized for fast processing, and reduces the event rate to around 1 kHz before data storage.",

Additional selection criteria are applied to each jet to remove jets potentially dominated by instrumental effects or reconstruction failures.

The analysis requires at least two jets with p T > 40 GeV and two light SS leptons with p T > 15 GeV (10 GeV) for electrons (muons). Electrons are identified based on a discriminant using shower shape and track quality variables, while the muon identification relies on the quality of the geometrical matching between the tracker and muon system measurements. In order to reject leptons from the decay of heavy flavor hadrons, the tracks are required to have an impact parameter compatible with the position of the primary vertex. Several isolation criteria are also applied, based on the scalar sum of hadron and photon p T within a cone centered on the lepton direction and whose radius decreases with its p T , the ratio of the p T of the lepton to that of the closest jet, and the relative p T of the lepton to that of the closest jet after lepton momentum subtraction. These criteria are designed to mitigate the loss of lepton efficiency caused by lepton-jet overlaps that occurs frequently in events with significant hadronic activity. A more detailed description of the set of identification and isolation variables used in the lepton selection can be found in Ref. [71]. The lepton reconstruction and identification efficiency is in the range of 45-70% (70-90%) for electrons (muons), with p T > 25 GeV, increasing as a function of p T and reaching the maximum value for p T > 60 GeV. In the lowmomentum regime, 15 < p T < 25 GeV for electrons and 10 < p T < 25 GeV for muons, the efficiencies are approximately 40% for electrons and 55% for muons. The lepton trigger efficiency for electrons is in the range of 90-98%, converging to the maximum value for p T > 30 GeV, and it is around 92% for muons.",

For example the HH category drives the sensitivity for most of the RPC scenarios (T1tttt, T5ttbbWW, T5tttt, T1tttt, T5qqqqWW) with a large mass splitting between the gluino and the lightest neutralino. The HL and LL categories become relevant for lower mass splitting when one or both leptons tend to be soft. Scenarios resulting in the presence of one or multiple Z bosons in the final state such as T5qqqqWZ and T6ttHZ will typically be primarily constrained by the on-Z or off-Z category, also depending on the considered SUSY mass spectrum. Finally the LM category enhances the analysis sensitivity for RPV scenarios, in particular for T1qqqqL where no genuine p miss T is expected. Various SRs are constructed based on the jet multiplicity N jets , the b-tagged jet multiplicity N b , H T , p miss T , the charge of the SS pair, and m min T , which is defined below. The m min T variable, introduced in Ref. [71], is defined as the minimum of the transverse masses calculated from each of the leptons forming the SS pair and p miss T , except for the on-Z ML category where we only consider the transverse mass computed using the leptons not forming the Z candidate. It is characterized by a kinematic cutoff for events where p miss T only arises from the leptonic decay of a single W boson and is effective at discriminating signal and background signatures.",

In contrast, the expected event yields from other rare processes (including ZZ, triple boson production, tWZ, tZq, tttt, and double parton scattering) are summed up into a single contribution denoted as \"Rare\". Processes including a genuine photon, such as W\u03b3, Z\u03b3, tt\u03b3, and t\u03b3, are also considered and grouped together. They are referred to as \"X\u03b3\". All contributions from this category are estimated using simulated samples. Correction factors are applied to take into account small differences between data and simulation, including trigger, lepton selection, and b tagging efficiencies, with associated systematic uncertainties listed in Sect. 6. The second category consists of events where one of the selected leptons, generically denoted as \"nonprompt lepton\", is either a decay product of a heavy flavor hadron or, more rarely, a misidentified hadron. This category is typically the dominant one in SRs with moderate or low p miss T or low m min T (except for the on-Z ML SRs). This background is estimated directly from data using the \"tight-to-loose\" method [24,25]. This method is based on the probability for a nonprompt lepton passing loose selection criteria to also satisfy the tighter lepton selection used in the analysis. The number of events in an SR with N leptons, including at least one nonprompt lepton, can be estimated by applying this probability to a corresponding control region (CR) of events with N loose leptons where at least one of them fails the tight selection.",

The tight-to-loose ratio is computed separately for electrons and muons, and is parameterized as a function of the lepton \u03b7 and p corr T . The p corr T variable is defined as the sum of the lepton p T and the energy in the isolation cone exceeding the isolation threshold value applied to tight leptons.

This ratio was then used to predict the number of events with one prompt and one nonprompt SS dileptons in MC tt and W+jets events. The predicted and observed rates of SS dileptons were compared as a function of kinematic properties and found to agree within 30%. The data driven estimate was also compared to a direct prediction from simulation and a similar level of agreement was reached.     The final category is a subdominant background in all SRs and corresponds to events where the charge of a lepton is incorrectly measured. Charge misidentification primarily occurs when an electron undergoes bremsstrahlung in the tracker material or in the beam pipe. Similarly to the tightto-loose method, the number of SS lepton pairs where one of the leptons has its charge misidentified can be determined using the number of OS pairs and the knowledge of the charge misidentification rate. We use simulation to parameterize this rate as a function of p T and \u03b7 for electrons and find values varying between 10 \u22125 (central electrons with p T \u2248 20 GeV) and 5 \u00d7 10 \u22123 (forward electrons with p T \u2248 200 GeV). To calibrate the charge misidentification rate, we exploit the fact that charge misidentification only has a small effect on the electron energy measurement in the calorimeter. As a result, electron pairs from Z boson decays yield a sharp peak near the Z mass even when one of the electrons has a misidentified charge. The SS dielectron invariant mass distributions in data and MC can then be used to derive a correction factor to the MC charge misidentification rate. Good agreement between data and MC is found in 2016, while the charge misidentification rate in simulation corresponding to 2017 and 2018 data needs to be scaled up by a factor of 1.4. Muon charge misidentification arises from a relatively large uncertainty in the transverse momentum at high momentum or from a poor quality track. The various criteria applied in this analysis on the quality of the muon reconstruction lead to a misidentification rate at least one order of magnitude smaller than for electrons according to simulation. The muon charge misassignment has also been studied using cosmic ray muons with p T up to several hundred GeV, confirming the predictions from simulation [72]. It is therefore neglected. Correction factors are however applied to the simulation to account for a possible difference in the selection efficiency related to these criteria.",

Signal and background contributions estimated from simulation are affected by experimental uncertainties in the efficiency of the trigger, lepton reconstruction and identification [64,73], the efficiency of b tagging [69], the jet energy scale [67], the integrated luminosity [74][75][76]. An uncertainty is also assigned to the value of the inelastic cross section, which affects the pileup rate [77] and that can impact the description of the jet multiplicity or the p miss T resolution. Simulation is also affected by theoretical uncertainties, which are evaluated by varying the factorization and renormalization scales up and down by a factor of two, and by using different PDFs within the NNPDF3.0 and 3.1 PDF sets [35,36,78]. These uncertainties can affect both the overall yield (normalization) and the relative population (shape) across the SRs. Background normalization uncertainties are increased to 30%, either to account for the additional hadronic activity required (for WZ and W \u00b1 W \u00b1 ) or to take into consideration recent measurements (for ttW, ttZ) [79,80].

For each model, event yields in all SRs are used to obtain exclusion limits on the production cross section at 95% confidence level (CL) with an asymptotic formulation of the modified frequentist CL s criterion [82][83][84][85], where uncertainties are incorporated as nuisance parameters and profiled [84]. This procedure takes advantage of the differences in the distribution of events amongst the SR between the various SM backgrounds and the signal considered. The normalizations of the various backgrounds are in particular allowed to float within their uncertainties in the global fit, resulting in several backgrounds (nonprompt lepton, ttW/Z/H and rare processes) being pulled up by around 1 s.d. for most of the signal points considered, which are often characterized by a distinctive distribution of events across the SRs. This observation is consistent with the current measurements of ttW and ttZ processes performed by the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations [79,80]. The limits obtained are then used together with the theoretical cross section calculations to exclude regions of SUSY parameter space. Figure 7 shows observed and expected exclusion limits for simplified models of gluino pair production with each gluino decaying to off-or on-shell third-generation squarks. These models were introduced in Sect. 2 and denoted as T1tttt, T5ttbbWW, T5tttt, and T5ttcc. Similarly, Figs. 8 and 9 show the corresponding limits for T5qqqqWZ and T5qqqqWW, with two different assumptions on the chargino mass. Note that the T5qqqqWZ model assumes equal probabilities for the decay of the gluino into\u03c7 + 1 ,\u03c7 \u2212 1 , and\u03c7 0 2 . The exclusion limits for T6ttWW and T6ttHZ are displayed in Figs. 10 and 11, respectively. In the T6ttHZ model, the heavier top squark decays into a lighter top squark and a Z or H boson. The three sets of exclusion limits shown in Fig. 11 correspond to the branching fraction B(t 2 \u2192t 1 Z) having values of 0, 50, and 100%.",

This in particular applies to the uncompressed mass regime, resulting in an observed limit weaker than the expected one by one or two s.d. In the compressed mass regime, however, other SRs can become dominant, for example when the hadronic activity becomes limited. This happens in the T5qqqqWZ and T5qqqqWW models where the gluino and the lightest neutralino present a limited mass splitting (the region close to the diagonal in the left plots of Figs. 8, 9). In those scenarios the on-Z ML4 and HH3 SRs provide the best sensitivity, respectively. Additionally, if the intermediate chargino is nearly degenerate in mass with the lightest neutralino, both leptons become soft and LL SRs such as LL2 become relevant. Such a situation is encountered in the phase space region close to the diagonal in the right plots of Figs. 8 and 9. On-Z SRs (especially on-Z ML23) become important for models where an on-shell Z boson is produced (bottom plot in Fig. 11). The limits on the RPV models presented in Fig. 12 are mostly driven by another set of SRs (HH62 and LM11, the latter becoming more relevant for lower masses).",

These results also complement searches for gluino pair production conducted by CMS in final states with 0 or 1 lepton [86][87][88]. For the T1tttt scenario, the expected sensitivity of this analysis suffers from a lower branching fraction that makes it uncompetitive in the uncompressed mass regime. However, for a nearly degenerate mass spectrum, the SM background becomes of higher importance and the presence of an SS lepton pair significantly reduces it, leading to a similar sensitivity. The constraints on the two RPV models that were 137 fb Model-independent limits are also set on the product of cross section, branching fraction, detector acceptance, and reconstruction efficiency, for the production of an SS lepton pair with at least two extra jets and H T > 300 GeV. For this purpose, we select events from the HH and LM categories and calculate limits as a function of minimum p miss T or H T requirements starting at 300 and 1400 GeV, respectively. In order to remove the overlap between the two conditions, events selected for the H T scan must also satisfy p miss T < 300 GeV. The corresponding limits are presented in Fig. 13.

The data are found to be consistent with the standard model expectations. The results are interpreted as limits on cross sections at 95% confidence level for the production of new particles in simplified supersymmetric models, considering both R parity conserving and violating scenarios. Using calculations for these cross sections as functions of particle masses, the limits are translated into lower mass limits that are as large as 2.1 TeV for gluinos and 0.9 TeV for top and bottom squarks, depending on the details of the model. The results extend the gluino and squark mass observed and expected exclusions by up to 200 GeV, compared to the previous versions of this analysis.
