Recently, ATLAS also recorded 3 \u03bcb \u22121 of Xe+Xe collisions at the center-of-mass energy 5.44 TeV, which provides a new opportunity to study the system-size dependence of the chargedhadron production in heavy-ion collisions. The large acceptance of the ATLAS detector allows to measure the spectra of charged hadrons in a wide range of pseudorapidity and transverse momentum. The nuclear modification factors R AA are constructed as a ratio of the spectra measured in Pb+Pb or Xe+Xe collisions to that measured in pp collisions. The R AA obtained in the two systems are presented for different centrality intervals and the results are discussed.",

They have a characteristic curvature which is more pronounced in the central collisions. Curves reach a maximum at p T \u2248 2 GeV, then a minimum at around 7 GeV and then increase up to around 60 GeV. The behavior of R AA in Xe+Xe collisions above this value is difficult to ascertain due to the low statistics. In Pb+Pb collisions, the slope of R AA above p T \u2248 60 GeV diminishes. The stronger suppression in Pb+Pb than in Xe+Xe collisions for the same centrality intervals is expected because size of Pb+Pb collision system is larger than that of Xe+Xe collision. The right panel of Fig. 1   for Xe+Xe and Pb+Pb collisions in centrality intervals corresponding to approximately the same FCal E T . Collisions with the same FCal E T have about the same size. The observed suppressions are consistent between the two systems within the systematics uncertainties, suggesting scaling with the system size. Figure 2 shows comparison of nuclear modification factors for Xe+Xe and Pb+Pb collisions for centrality intervals of similar N part (left) and N coll (right). The production rate of low-p T (high-p T ) particles is rather proportional to N part (N coll ), and therefore the size of the two systems is expected to be comparable at similar N part . However, the agreement between the systems is still worse than in the right panel of Fig. 1. At p T around 7 GeV, the Xe+Xe results on the left panel of Fig. 2 show slightly stronger suppression for the central events, but slightly milder suppression for peripheral events. This feature is demonstrated in Fig. 3 where it is clearly visible. At higher p T (26-30 GeV), the suppressions are comparable within uncertainties and R AA measured in both Xe+Xe and Pb+Pb collisions follow the same dependency, which suggests the suppression scales with the system size.",
