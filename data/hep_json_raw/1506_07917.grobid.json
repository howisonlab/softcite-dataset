Determining the hierarchy is a critical step toward further precision measurements in the neutrino sector. The hierarchy is also central to interpreting the next generation of neutrinoless double beta decay results, plays a role in numerous cosmological and astrophysical questions, and serves as a powerful model discriminant for theories of neutrino mass generation and unification. Various current and planned experiments claim sensitivity for establishing the neutrino mass hierarchy. We review the most promising of these here, paying special attention to points of concern and consolidating the projected sensitivities into an outlook for the years ahead.",

[61] In addition to these mass splittings, we know at varying levels of precision the values of the three mixing angles \u03b8 12 , \u03b8 13 , and \u03b8 23 [6]. We do not have good information about the sign of the atmospheric mass splitting, the complex phases in the PMNS matrix of Eq. (1), the absolute masses {m i } of the neutrinos, or whether neutrinos are Majorana particles. Furthermore, several experimental anomalies suggest that extensions to the neutrino standard model may be needed [7]. The scope of this review is limited to the experimental prospects for measuring the unknown sign of the atmospheric mass splitting or, equivalently, whether \u03bd 3 is the heaviest or lightest mass eigenstate. These two possibilities are termed, respectively, the normal and inverted neutrino mass hierarchies, and Figure 1 shows the two cases graphically. Some authors prefer the term \"mass ordering\" over \"mass hierarchy\" when a third case -a degenerate spectrumis relevant to the context. In a degenerate spectrum, the mass of the lightest neutrino is large compared to the individual mass differences, i.e. m 1 \u2248 m 2 \u2248 m 3 . Of note, neutrinoless double beta decay rates depend strongly on the mass hierarchy only if the mass spectrum is non-degenerate [8]. In more general contexts, authors regularly use \"ordering\" and \"hierarchy\" interchangeably.",

Knowledge of the hierarchy is also vital to interpretation of neutrinoless double beta decay results, serves as an input to cosmological and astrophysical measurements, and is a powerful discriminant among unification and neutrino mass models. The neutrino mass hierarchy may also be the next major unknown of the Standard Model to be measured. In this article we review the experimental outlook for making this measurement. In the normal case, the masses exhibit a hierarchical pattern, and the lightest neutrino has the largest admixture of electron flavor. The relative ordering m2>m1 is known through observations of solar neutrinos, which are subject to resonant matter effects in the sun [4,[9][10][11].",

In particular, were these data to yield m i 2 |\u2206m 2 32 | \u223c 100 meV, the hierarchy would have to be normal. A analogous constraint can be made for the effective electron neutrino mass measured in beta decay experiments, but upcoming experiments will not have the mass sensitivity required to provide hierarchy information even if the necessary conditions on the mass spectrum (normal hierarchy and small m 1 ) are met. Neutrinoless double beta decay searches will rely on external knowledge of the hierarchy to interpret observed (or limited) decay rates [8] and will not provide independent measurements of the hierarchy themselves. Likewise, the neutrino fluxes from supernovae carry signatures of the hierarchy due to both matter effects and collective (high neutrino density) effects [15][16][17], but uncertainties in the astrophysical models make reliable determination of the hierarchy through supernova neutrino observations unlikely even if a nearby supernova event were to occur in the near future.",

In practice, each increment in hierarchy sensitivity adds importantly to our understanding.

As the hierarchy significance increases, so too does the significance of any measurement that takes the hierarchy as input. Thus, while a 3\u03c3 hierarchy measurement will be a historic milestone for particle physics, a continued push to 5\u03c3 or beyond is needed if we are to make 5\u03c3 claims for other, quantitatively related questions (e.g., exclusion of Majorana neutrinos due to future non-observation of neutrinoless double beta decay).

To increase the scale of this perturbation, one must increase the neutrino energy E. However, one must also stay near the oscillation maximum of \u2206 \u2248 \u03c0/2 to have significant oscillation probability at all. Thus, the experimental baseline L must also increase, leading to the practical fact that an increased sensitivity to the mass hierarchy in the \u03bd e and \u03bd e appearance channels comes from having a longer experimental baseline. Figure 2 shows how the appearance probability changes over the three baselines discussed here: 295 km (T2K), 810 km (NO\u03bdA), and 1300 km (DUNE). The probabilities are plotted for all possible values of the CP-violating phase \u03b4, tracing out ellipses in the figure. The uncertainty in \u03b4 complicates the mass hierarchy measurement, although less so at the longest baselines since the hierarchy-dependent matter effects become larger than any possible \u03b4-induced changes in the oscillation probabilities. Hierarchy sensitivities for long-baseline experiments are often quoted as a function of the true (if unknown) \u03b4. The uncertainty on \u03b8 23 is the next largest factor after \u03b4, with the current allowed range of \u03b8 23 leading to a peak sensitivity uncertainty of roughly 20%. This dependence is not always explicit in experiments' official sensitivity plots, which often assume a fixed typical value for \u03b8 23 , say \u03c0/4.",

NO\u03bdA began taking data with a fully deployed 14-kton detector in 2014. With its full planned exposure, NO\u03bdA can determine the hierarchy at 2-3\u03c3 if the value of \u03b4 falls in a favorable range. For unfavorable \u03b4 values, NO\u03bdA extracts correlated information about \u03b4 and the hierarchy and thus does not determine the hierarchy outright. In these so-called \"degenerate\" cases, it helps a bit to combine NO\u03bdA and T2K data since T2K is sensitive to \u03b4 but largely insensitive to the hierarchy.  At the T2K baseline, the neutrino and antineutrino oscillation probabilities differ very little between the two hierarchies and thus measurements of these probabilities offer minimal hierarchy discrimination. For NO\u03bdA, significant splitting of the two cases occurs. For DUNE, the separation is complete, allowing for unambiguous determination of the hierarchy regardless of \u03b4, assuming small enough measurement errors on the probabilities. This figure is illustrative only, as it keeps other oscillation parameters fixed and as a full experiment involves a range of neutrino energies.",

The multi-detector approach makes the T2K and NO\u03bdA experiments statistics limited for some time, so our knowledge of the hierarchy in the next five to ten years will be driven in part by the beam power achieved at Fermilab and, to a lesser extent, at J-PARC. The NuMI beam reached 400 kW in early 2015 and is projected to reach the design 700 kW within two years, after the completion of upgrades to the Booster, which lies upstream in the accelerator chain. The J-PARC neutrino source is operating at \u223c325 kW, and significant future upgrades are needed to realize the planned 750 kW. ",

Although some open questions remain regarding near detector performance, far detector event selections, and systematic uncertainties, these hierarchy sensitivity estimates are unlikely to vary grossly as the open questions are addressed. The greatest uncertainty in the reach of DUNE is in the timeline and scope of the experiment. The collaboration aims to deploy an initial 10-kton detector underground at SURF by 2021, followed shortly by completion of the neutrino source and further deployment to 40 kton. These timescales are achievable but aggressive. The recent US high energy physics strategic plan [31] strongly supports this effort, and operation of a 10-kton detector and a 1.2-MW source is estimated to begin in 2025. How quickly additional detector mass can be added and how quickly a 1.2-MW beam can be deployed will play a large role in the sensitivities realized.

Since detectors can collect these neutrinos from all directions, the distance between neutrino production and detection can range from tens of kilometers for neutrinos produced above the detector to 13,000 kilometers for neutrinos produced below (i.e., on the other side of the Earth). This wide range of baselines, together with a wide range of energies, makes atmospheric neutrinos particularly useful probes of neutrino oscillations. Atmospheric neutrino experiments gain hierarchy sensitivity through the resonant-like enhancement of matter effects experienced by either neutrinos or antineutrinos (depending on the hierarchy) as they pass through the Earth [32][33][34]. The effect on the oscillation probabilities is often presented in so-called oscillograms (e.g., Figure 5). Experiments that can study neutrinos and antineutrinos separately need only determine which sample exhibits the matter effect enhancement. Experiments that cannot separate these must make a statistical inference based on knowledge about the incident neutrino and antineutrino fluxes. Current experiments, notably Super-K [35] and MINOS [5], have demonstrated the principle of this measurement, but these detectors are too small and thus have too few events to obtain significant hierarchy sensitivity, despite their decade-long exposures. Proposed future large detectors fall into three categories: water Cherenkov (PINGU, ORCA, Hyper-K), magnetized iron tracker (INO), and liquid argon TPC (DUNE). PINGU projections have evolved significantly in the past couple of years. Detailed studies of detector performance and the effects of systematic uncertainties (notably energy scale; \u03bd and \u03bd cross sections; and the oscillation parameters \u2206m 2 32 , \u03b8 23 , and \u03b8 13 ) have been carried out [36]. Further, the prospects for improvements through detector geometry optimization, incorporation of event inelasticity as a weak neutrino/antineutrino discriminant [38], and more advanced reconstruction techniques suggest that the current sensitivity estimates may be conservative. Figure 6 shows the sensitivity of the combined track (\u03bd \u00b5 charged current) and cascade (all other) channels in PINGU, which reaches 3\u03c3 hierarchy sensitivity in 4 years of running if \u03b8 23 is in the lower octant.",

Like T2K, T2HK has limited hierarchy sensitivity on its own given its baseline, and thus Hyper-K's hierarchy sensitivity comes primarily from atmospheric neutrinos. The excellent event reconstruction capabilities of the Hyper-K detector are well understood based on long Super-K experience. The most glaring uncertainty for Hyper-K is whether the project proceeds.

Given the focus of the U.S. and European long-baseline communities on liquid argon TPC approaches, substantial funding may need to come from Japan alone.

            "text": "For the \u223c1-8-MeV \u03bd e streaming from a nuclear reactor, the first oscillation maximum for \u2206m 2 21 -driven solar oscillations occurs at L\u223c100 km and for \u2206m 2 32 -driven atmospheric oscillations at L\u223c2 km. KamLAND has successfully exploited the former to measure \u03b8 12 and \u2206m 2 21 [4]. More recently Daya Bay, RENO, and Double Chooz have exploited the latter to measure \u03b8 13 and the effective squared-mass splitting \u2206m 2 ee [45][46][47]. At the longer of these baselines, the small amplitude and rapid (with respect to E) atmospheric oscillation will be superimposed on a deeper and slower solar oscillation. The relative phase of these oscillation modes reveals the relative sizes of \u2206m 2 31 and \u2206m 2 32 . Figure 7 demonstrates the principle of the measurement for a baseline of 50 km. The broad solar dip in the \u03bd e survival probability is visible together with the fast atmospheric oscillations, and flipping the sign of \u2206m 2 32 shifts the period and phase of these oscillations in an observable way. Leveraging this effect requires a large, low-background detector with unprecedented energy resolution. Over the past decade, the experimental requirements have been extensively explored [48][49][50][51][52][53][54], leading today to two experimental proposals, JUNO and RENO-50 [55,56]. JUNO (Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory) proposes a 20kton liquid scintillator detector with 3%/ E/MeV energy resolution. For comparison, KamLAND used a 1-kton detector with an energy resolution of 6.4%/ E/MeV [4]. The required advance in energy resolution is to come from increased photocathode coverage, higher-efficiency phototubes, and brighter yet more transparent scintillator. R&D on these fronts has led to encouraging progress, but significant work remains to demonstrate that this performance is achievable [57].",

Each core corresponds to a slightly different baseline, and the JUNO sensitivities take into account the resulting smearing of the oscillation pattern. With a 6-year run, JUNO projects a mass hierarchy sensitivity of 4\u03c3, give or take 10% depending on the level of precision achieved by long-baseline experiments on the atmospheric mass splitting. JUNO has strong support from China and is moving ahead, with operations to start around 2020. If the detector R&D does not lead to the performance metrics required, JUNO's hierarchy sensitivity could be considerably reduced. However, JUNO has an impressive precision oscillation physics program separate from the mass hierarchy measurement [57]. RENO-50 is a similar proposal, based in Korea, to use an 18-kton detector with performance requirements that are essentially identical to those of JUNO [56]. While sensitivities of 3\u03c3 have appeared in the literature [58], the calculations are notably less detailed than those of JUNO (e.g., accounting for the smearing from multiple reactors). Detector R&D funding for RENO-50 has been established, but start of operations by 2020 as proposed by the experiment's proponents is likely optimistic.",

The NO\u03bdA and T2K combination is discussed in Section III A, above. Atmospheric and reactor experiments offer a particularly interesting synergy, as fits to the wrong hierarchy introduce different pulls on \u2206m 2 32 between the two techniques. The PINGU+JUNO case is explored in Ref. [60]. Setting aside the potential sensitivity boosts via combinations, however, it is critical to measure the hierarchy through independent techniques, not only for the added confidence in the results but also as protection against unfavorable parameters of nature. To wit, atmospheric sensitivities are largely independent of \u03b4, in contrast to accelerator sensitivities. Reactor sensitivities are invariant with respect to \u03b8 23 , in contrast to atmospheric sensitivities. Cosmological measurements are entirely free of dependence on oscillation parameters but do require a very particular mass spectrum. Table I summarizes the experimental situation and the prospects for determining the neutrino mass hierarchy in the coming years. The table lists the most critical concerns, some of which are major. However, if even just a couple of the promising experimental options becomes reality without delay, the outlook can be succinctly stated: A statistically significant (>95% CL) hierarchy determination is possible, but not guaranteed, by 2020; a statistically significant determination is likely by the late 2020s; and a definitive (>5\u03c3) measurement is possible by the late 2020s and likely by the early 2030s.
