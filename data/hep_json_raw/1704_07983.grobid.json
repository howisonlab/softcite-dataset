These environments are characterized by charged-particle separations of the order of the tracking detectors sensor granularity. Basic track quantities are compared between 3.2 fb \u22121 of data collected by the ATLAS experiment and simulation of protonproton collisions producing high-transverse-momentum jets at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The impact of chargedparticle separations and multiplicities on the track reconstruction performance is discussed. The track reconstruction efficiency in the cores of jets with transverse momenta between 200 and 1600 GeV is quantified using a novel, datadriven, method. The method uses the energy loss, dE/dx, to identify pixel clusters originating from two charged particles. Of the charged particles creating these clusters, the measured fraction that fail to be reconstructed is 0.061\u00b10.006 (stat.)\u00b1 0.014 (syst.) and 0.093 \u00b1 0.017 (stat.) \u00b1 0.021 (syst.) for jet transverse momenta of 200-400 GeV and 1400-1600 GeV, respectively.",

Events with TeV-scale jets showering in the detectors, or \u03c4 -leptons and b-hadrons that pass through multiple active layers of material, now occur at high enough rates to be studied in detail. These signatures also occur in potential new physics scenarios including massive new resonances decaying to highly boosted bosons or top quarks whose decay products are often reconstructed as a single jet [1]. In the cores of highly e-mail: atlas.publications@cern.ch energetic hadronic jets and \u03c4 -leptons, the average separation between highly collimated charged particles is comparable to the granularity of individual sensors of the inner detector. This can create confusion within the algorithms used to reconstruct charged-particle trajectories, or tracks. Therefore, without careful consideration, the track reconstruction efficiency in these dense environments is limited, resulting in difficulties in identifying long-lived b-hadrons and hadronic \u03c4 -decays, or in calibrating the energy and mass of jets. To prevent losses in efficiency, to increase the possibility of discovering new phenomena and to allow more detailed measurements of the newly opened kinematic regime, a dedicated optimization for dense environments was performed and deployed in the ATLAS [2] reconstruction for the start of Run 2. This updated reconstruction provides superior physics performance, reduces the required computing resources, and is now the default used by ATLAS.",

The quality of the expected performance is evaluated in dedicated single-particle and dijet simulation samples (Sect. 5), and comparisons between simulation and data are performed in events with energetic jets. Extending these mainly Monte Carlo (MC) simulation-based studies, a fully data-driven method is introduced in Sect. 6 which probes the fraction of tracks lost in reconstruction, due to the high density and collimation of charged particles in high-transverse-momentum 1 ( p T ) jets.

Therefore, seed types are considered starting with SCT-only, then (a) Single-particle pixel clusters (b) Merged pixel cluster pixel-only and finally mixed-detector seeds, representing the order of purity. A number of criteria are placed on the seeds to maximize purity: first and foremost seed-type-dependent momentum and impact parameter requirements. Also, the use of space-points in multiple seeds is carefully controlled. Purity is further improved by requiring that one additional space-point is compatible with the particle's trajectory estimated from the seed. A combinatorial Kalman filter [11] is then used to build track candidates from the chosen seeds by incorporating additional space-points from the remaining layers of the pixel and SCT detectors which are compatible with the preliminary trajectory. The filter creates multiple track candidates per seed if more than one compatible spacepoint extension exists on the same layer. These criteria result in a very high efficiency for reconstructing primary particles (for example, the muon reconstruction efficiency is greater than 99% [12]) and the removal of tracks created from purely random collections of spacepoints. Suppressing such purely combinatorial tracks is essential in order to remain within the available CPU budget for event reconstruction. From approximately 13 space-point combinations created for an isolated charged particle traversing the entire ID, the time-intensive combinatorial Kalman filter is, on average, called in its entirety 1.1 times. As all realistic combinations of space-points have been made, there are a number of track candidates where space-points overlap, or have been incorrectly assigned.

These weights reflect the average number of expected measurements in each subdetector. A properly reconstructed track is required to have a truth-matching probability above 0.5. Such a requirement is imposed for all reconstruction efficiencies presented in this paper. Fake tracks are those which have a truth-matching probability below 0.5. Due to the careful pruning of seeds, the majority of reconstructed fake tracks are from the misallocation of clusters from other particles to a track and not purely random combinations of clusters. The track reconstruction procedure described in Sect. 3 results in a negligible number of fake tracks in dense environments. For jets with a p T above 200 GeV in the dijet MC sample described in Sect. 4, the fraction of fake tracks is below 0.5%.

To study possible inefficiencies of the reconstruction algorithm, the cluster assignment efficiency is shown in Fig. 10 as a function of the minimum truth particle separation at the sensor's surface for the first two layers of the pixel detector. It is defined as the fraction of clusters created by a particle that are then used on the reconstructed track of said particle. With the closest truth particle separated by 400 \u00b5m at the IBL, the cluster assignment efficiency at this layer is in excess of 99% for the \u03c1 and three-prong \u03c4 samples, and 98% for the B 0 samples.

Since in the simpler topology \u03c1 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 the cluster has to be assigned to a maximum of two tracks, the cluster assignment efficiency is 99% down to the smallest distances shown.

It is required that the stable charged particles are created before the IBL ited in the B 0 and three-prong \u03c4 samples. The case of more than three charged particles contributing to a pixel cluster in the B 0 decay results in an additional assignment inefficiency on the B-layer. Regardless of how well the ambiguity solver identifies merged pixel clusters and assigns them to tracks, a substantial inefficiency remains at high initial-particle momenta due to the necessary limitations on shared SCT clusters. Figure 11 shows the reconstructable efficiency of the \u03c1 and three-prong \u03c4 decays utilizing MC truth information. This is defined as the efficiency to be able to reconstruct all of the charged decay products from a given resonance having satisfied the cluster multiplicity requirements defined in Sect. 3.3. All merged pixel clusters are assumed to have been identified, so for a fixed maximum number of allowed shared SCT clusters, this represents the maximum achievable reconstruction efficiency. The loss in efficiency is exacerbated by increasing charged-particle multiplicities as in the three-prong \u03c4 sample. This limit is fixed at two shared clusters. The efficiency improvement obtained from loosening this limit is not sufficient to justify the associated increase in the proportion of fake tracks.

These samples are crucial for understanding the effects of charged-particle separations and multiplicities on the performance, but they are insufficient to quantify the expected performance in the dense jet environments evident in Fig. 4. As demonstrated in Sect. 5.2, samples of dijet MC events do provide a reasonable description of jets in data. The following contains studies of the track reconstruction efficiency in these samples. Figure 13 shows the charged-primary-particle reconstruction efficiency dependence on the angular distance of a particle to the jet axis for different jet \u03b7 and p T ranges. All charged particles studied are required to be created before the IBL. The efficiency drops rapidly towards the centre of the jet, where the charged-particle density is maximal. A slight decrease in efficiency towards the edge of the jet is consistent with an isolated-track efficiency that rises with chargedparticle p T [27] and a decrease in the average chargedparticle p T with distance from the jet core. The dependence of the efficiency on the jet p T and on the production radius of the charged particle, where charged particles are not required to be created before the IBL, is shown in Fig. 14. The decrease in efficiency with production radius is from two effects. Firstly, particles created beyond the first active layers of the ID create fewer clusters. Secondly, with the shorter flight length to   Fig. 12 Single-track reconstruction efficiency is shown as a a function of the initial particle's p T when it is required that the parent particle decays before the IBL for the decay products of a \u03c1, three-and five-prong \u03c4 and a B 0 and, b versus the production radius for the decay products of a three-and five-prong \u03c4 as well as a B 0 , where no requirement is imposed on the production radius of stable charged particles R(jet,particle) \u0394 The efficiency to reconstruct charged primary particles in jets with a |\u03b7| < 1.2 and b |\u03b7| > 1.2 is shown as a function of the angular distance of the particle from the jet axis for various jet p T for simulated dijet MC events the next active layer, the average separation between particles is smaller compared to prompt decays, producing more merged clusters.

This section introduces a novel method to probe this performance in data. A measurement of the fraction of tracks lost in reconstruction due to the high density and collimation of charged particles in highp T jets is presented for the subset of tracks with a B-layer cluster created by two charged particles. The dE/dx of a charged particle traversing the pixel sensor is measured from the charge collected in the clusters associated with the reconstructed track. With single particles and thin layers, one expects the dE/dx measurements to approximately follow a Landau distribution [28]. A typical particle reconstructed from an LHC collision is expected to be a minimum-ionizing particle (MIP). Thus, two particles contributing to the same cluster are expected to deposit twice the energy of a single MIP. In the context of this paper, dE/dx is As demonstrated in the previous sections, near the jet core the charged-particle density is high and particles can be highly collimated. The tracks of these particles are thus more likely to create merged clusters, as shown in Fig. 5. By fitting the cluster dE/dx for reconstructed tracks near the core of the jet, single-particle clusters can be statistically separated from merged clusters. The fraction of lost tracks can therefore be inferred from the number of times only one reconstructed track is associated with a cluster dE/dx compatible with two MIPs. At truth-level, this fraction is defined as follows: the denominator is the number of truth particles passing the analysis selections (listed in Sect. 6.1, and including a p T > 10 GeV requirement), which have a B-layer cluster created by exactly two charged particles; the numerator is the subset of these particles which failed to be reconstructed.",

As the jet p T increases, so does F lost 2 , with a similar trend observed in both data and simulation. This increase is caused by an increasing density of charged particles, which thereby causes higher collimation of the track pair, and is not due to confusion in correctly assigning clusters to tracks. At a certain point, the two particles are so collimated that the reconstructed tracks start to overlap completely up to the radius of the SCT detector. At that point a similar effect as shown for tracks from the \u03c1 decay in Figs. 10 and 12 occurs. The cluster assignment efficiency for reconstructed tracks remains constant with increasing jet p T , indicating no degradation of performance due to the environmental effects besides the second track. Only because of their increasingly collimated nature, the probability of losing one of the tracks rises. This effect was confirmed in simulation for tracks selected by this analysis.",

The ambiguity-solver stage of the reconstruction chain is described, including the usage of a neural-networkbased approach to identify pixel clusters created by multiple charged particles. The current performance is demonstrated with simulated samples of a single particle decaying to a set of collimated charged particles. In the cores of jets, the number of IBL clusters on tracks, as well as the expected track reconstruction efficiency, is robust up to the highest investigated p T values.",

            "text": "A novel, fully data-driven technique, using the energy loss to identify clusters as originating from two charged particles is introduced to measure the fraction of charged particles, creating these clusters, that fail to be reconstructed. The results are presented using tracks with p T above 10 GeV in the core of a jet from 3.2 fb \u22121 of 13 TeV proton-proton collisions at the LHC. The measured fraction of lost tracks as a function of jet transverse momentum was found to range from 0.061 \u00b1 0.006(stat.) \u00b1 0.014(syst.) to 0.093 \u00b1 0.017(stat.) \u00b1 0.021(syst.) as the jet p T increases from 200 to 1600 GeV. Data and simulation are compatible for the full studied jetp T range. This result can be used to minimize the uncertainty in the track reconstruction inefficiency in the cores of jets relevant for jet energy and mass calibrations as well as measurements of jet properties.",
