Also, as the mechanism of confinement is still one of the unanswered questions in QCD, it is still unproven if the linear approximation (corresponding to a constant string force) in the confinement term is (a) valid to all orders of \u03b1 S and (b) valid even in the far long range r> 1.3 fm (i.e. in the string breaking regime). In fact, studies of potential constructed with two-gluon exchanges [4]  [5] lead to a number of additional terms with different r dependances. In addition, the high lying states (e.g. L\u22642, n\u22653) are sensitive to the string constant k 1 GeV/fm, which is the slope of the confinement term, and mass measurements can provide a precise measurement of k. \u2022 The strong coupling constant in the charmonium system has a quite high value \u03b1 S =0.54 [6], so there might be non-perturbative effects becoming visible e.g. in the hyperfine splittings. \u2022 What is the nature of the newly observed narrow states near thresholds, which do not fit into potential model calculations? Are they molecular states? Or tetraquarks? Or threshold effects? As an example, molecular potentails might contain r \u22122 and r \u22123 [7] terms, not present in the Cornell potential, and leading to eigenstates with masses different from the quark-antiquark potential. \u2022 There are yet unobserved states, some of them expected narrow, e.g. the 3 ",

Previous width measurements [17] showed values around \u0393 15 MeV from radiative J/\u03c8 and \u03c8 decays, and values around \u0393 30 MeV from B meson decays. However, this is probably not surprising, as in the radiative decays the cross section varies according to E a \u03b3 with an exponent a=3\u22127. This energy dependance modifies the lineshape and the width determination becomes non-trivial. On the other hand, in the reaction \u03b3\u03b3\u2192\u03b7 c the Breit-Wigner line shape is an appropriate approximation. In a new high statistics measurement by BaBar with a data set of 469 fb \u22121 and 14090 \u03b7 c signal events, a high precision measurement of the mass m=2982.2\u00b10.4\u00b11.6 MeV and the width \u0393=31.7\u00b11.2\u00b10.8 MeV of the \u03b7_c could be obtained. This measurement represents a factor 3 improvement in both statistical and systematic errors compared to the BaBar measurement in 2008 in B meson decays [9] and the Belle measurement in 2008 in \u03b3\u03b3 collisions [10].",

It was confirmed in the same process by BaBar [14] and confirmed in inclusive production in pp production at \u221a s=1.8 TeV at CDF-II [15] and D0 [16]. Among the newly observed charmonium-like states (sometimes referred to as XYZ states) the X(3872) is the only one with several decay channels having been observed. It has a surprisingly very narrow width \u0393<2.  [19]. The decay into D \u00b1 D \u2213 * is kinematically forbidden, but the decay into D 0 D 0 * is a strong decay and among the so far observed decays it represents the dominant one, i.e. the branching fraction is a factor 9 higher than for the decay into J/\u03c8\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 . In this decay channel, BaBar measured surprisingly a high mass of the X(3872) as m=3875.1 +0.7 \u22120.5 (stat.)\u00b10.5(syst.) MeV [20]. This high value initiated discussion, that there might be two different X states, namely X(3872) and X(3875), which would fit to a tetraquark hypothesis [21] and the two different states [ccuu] and [ccdd]. On the other hand Belle measured in the same decay channel the mass as m=3872.9 +0.6 \u22120.4 (stat.) +0.4 \u22120.5 (syst.) MeV [22] and thus consistent with the world average [17]. A possible explanation of the discrepancy is the difficulty of performing fits to signals close to threshold. In fact, the two fits used two very different approaches:",

            "text": "There was a priori no understanding of the fact, why the transition of the X(3872) to a n=2 charmonium state should be stronger than to n=1. In fact, quite the opposite behaviour was expected. In case of X(3872)\u2192J/\u03c8\u03b3 the photon energy is E \u03b3 =775 MeV, and thus due to vector meson dominance \u03c1 and \u03c9 can contribute to the amplitudes. However, in case of X(3872)\u2192\u03c8 \u03b3 with the smaller E \u03b3 =186 MeV the transition can only proceed through light quark annihilation with an expected small amplitude. A new measurement by Belle of both radiative channels was based upon a data set of 711 fb \u22121 [26]. The background was studied in MC simulations and revealed peaking behaviour in some background components close to the signal region. The signal X(3872)\u2192J/\u03c8\u03b3 was clearly reestablished with 30.0 +8.2 \u22127.4 signal events (4.9\u03c3 significance) for B + \u2192K + X(3872) and 5.7 +3.5 \u22122.8 signal events (2.4\u03c3 significance) for B 0 \u2192K 0 X(3872). For X(3872)\u2192\u03c8 \u03b3, the four decay channels B + \u2192K + X(3872) and B 0 \u2192K 0 X(3872) with X(3872)\u2192\u03c8 \u03b3 with \u03c8 \u2192l + l \u2212 and \u03c8 \u2192J/\u03c8\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 . Charged and neutral B modes were treated separately, but the two \u03c8 subdecay modes were fitted simultaneously because of their different background shapes. The signal was treated as a double Gaussian, the combinatorial background was parameterized as a threshold function. The shape of the \u03c8 K * and \u03c8 K background, and in particular the peaking structures, was modeled as a sum of bifurcated gaussians using a large MC sample. The signal yields were determined as 5.0 +11.9 \u221211.0 signal events (0.4\u03c3 significance) for B + \u2192K + X(3872) and 1.5 +4.8 \u22123.9 signal events (0.2\u03c3 significance) for B 0 \u2192K 0 X(3872). Thus, contrary to BaBar, Belle observed no signal, which would imply that there is no indication that the radiative transition from X(3872) to n=2 charmonium is stronger than to n=1 charmonium. In the same analysis, the decay \u03c7 c1,2 \u2192J/\u03c8\u03b3 was used as a reference channel with signal yields of 32.8 +10.9 \u221210.2 (3.6\u03c3 significance) for B + \u2192K + \u03c7 c2 and 2.8 +4.7 \u22123.9 (0.7\u03c3 significance) for B 0 \u2192K 0 \u03c7 c2 . In the charged mode, this represents the first observation of a J P =2 + state in a rare exclusive final state in a B meson decay, and thus a transition 0 \u2212 \u21920 \u2212 2 + .",

            "text": "As the \u03c1 meson carries isospin I=1, the X(3872) seems to violate isospin conservation in the decay X(3872)\u2192J/\u03c8\u03c1(\u2192\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ). One of the proposed explanations [27] is \u03c1/\u03c9 mixing, and therefore the investigation of the decay X(3872)\u2192J/\u03c8\u03c9(\u2192\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 ) is of importance. The difficulty hereby is the nearby Y(3940) state, which is also known to decay into the same final state. The latter decay was investigated be Belle with a data set of 275\u00d710 6 B meson pairs. The mass of the Y(3940) was determined as 3943\u00b111(stat.)\u00b113(syst.) MeV with a width of 87\u00b122(stat.)\u00b126(syst.) MeV. Belle also observed a signal for X(3872)\u2192J/\u03c8\u03c9(\u2192\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 ), based upon a data set of 256 fb \u22121 [29]. The measured efficiency corrected ratio of X(3872)\u2192J/\u03c8\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 / X(3872)\u2192J/\u03c8\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 = 1.0\u00b10.4(stat.)\u00b10.3(syst.) indicated another case of isospin violation due to the additional \u03c0 0 . BaBar published slightly different values for the Y(3940) with a data set of 383\u00d710 6 B meson pairs mass [30], namely a mass of 3914.6 +3.8 \u22123.4 (stat.)\u00b12.0(syst.) MeV and a width of 34 +12 \u22128 (stat.)\u00b15(syst.) MeV. However, a signal for X(3872)\u2192J/\u03c8\u03c9(\u2192\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 ) was not observed. In a recent re-analysis with 433 fb \u22121 by BaBar, a requirement on the 3-pion mass was adjusted, i.e. the lower offset was extended from 0.7695 GeV to 0.7400 GeV. With this change in the analysis technique BaBar was able to confirm the Belle signal for X(3872)\u2192J/\u03c8\u03c9(\u2192\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 ) and confirm the large isospin violation for the ratio X(3872)\u2192J/\u03c8\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 / X(3872)\u2192J/\u03c8\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 measured as 0.7\u00b10.3(stat.) and 1.7\u00b11.3(stat.) for B + and B 0 decays, respectively. In the re-analysis, BaBar also investigated the shape of the 3\u03c0 mass distribution in order to determine the quantum number of the X(3872). A similar analysis for the 2\u03c0 mass distribution in case of X(3872)\u2192J/\u03c8\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 was performed before by Belle [32] and CDF-II [33]. The result in both cases was that S-wave is preferred. However, in the new BaBar analysis the shape of the 3\u03c0 mass distribution seems to indicate that P-wave is preferred. For the 2\u03c0 case and Swave, a parity of +1 for the X(3872) is preferred, leading to a tentative assignment of J PC =1 ++ . This quantum number assignment is also supported by angular analyses [29] [34] and leads to a possible charmonium state assignment of \u03c7 c1 ( 3 P 1 ), which is an n=2 state with a mass of 3953 MeV as predicted by potential models [6] and thus 70 MeV too high compared to the observation. For the 3\u03c0 case and P-wave, a parity of \u22121 for the X(3872) is preferred, leading to a possible assignment of J PC =2 \u2212+ . Then a possible charmonium assignment is \u03b7 c2 ( 1 D 2 ), which is an n=1 state. The predicted mass is 100 MeV lower than for the \u03c7 c1 . This state would be an L=2 meson. In a different analysis, Belle investigated the J/\u03c8\u03c9 final state in \u03b3\u03b3 collisions based upon 694 fb \u22121 [35]. This analysis not only uses \u03d2(4S), but also \u03d2(3S) and \u03d2(5S) data (see Tab. 1). The event selection uses a p T <0.1 GeV/c balance requirement. The final state in \u03b3\u03b3 collisions is required to have isospin I=0. Fig. 2 shows the W distribution of the final candidate events, where W is defined as W =m 5 -m(l + l \u2212 )+m J/\u03c8 . m 5 is the invariant mass of the system constructed from four charged tracks and a neutral pion candidate. A clear enhancement seen just above J/\u03c8\u03c9 threshold with 49\u00b114(stat.)\u00b14(syst.) events (7.7\u03c3 stat. significance). The fitted mass is 3915\u00b13(stat.)\u00b12(syst.) MeV, thus it might be the observation the Y(3940) state in a second production mode. However, the fitted width is \u0393=17\u00b110(stat.)\u00b13(syst.) MeV, which is narrower than the width of the Y(3940) as measured in B decays. The production mode allows to establish the charge parity C=+1 for this state, same as the X(3872), but the determination of the other quantum numbers would require more statistics.",

For the charmonium system, there are two observed D-wave states above the DD threshold, namely the \u03c8(3770) (n=1) and the \u03c8(4153) (n=2). Both are J PC =1 \u2212\u2212 and broad, i.e. their experimentally measured width is >20 MeV. For the bottomonium system, there are two D-wave states predicted below threshold and thus narrow, i.e. their hadronic width \u226430 keV [38]. Consequently, in case of an observation it might even be possible to resolve the triplet of J PC =0 \u2212\u2212 , 1 \u2212\u2212 and 2 \u2212\u2212 .

Bottomonium spectroscopy is studied in \u03d2(nS) decays. Highly excited states such as L=2 states are clearly identified and provide accurate tests for potential models. States which are not consistent with any potential model, such as the X(3872), are studied in new ways, such as radiative decays or production in radiative decays. Surprising properties such as large isospin violation are confirmed.",
