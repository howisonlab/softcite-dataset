The product of the inclusive cross section and branching fraction is measured to be \u03c3 (pp \u2192 Z/\u03b3 * +X) B(Z/\u03b3 * \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 ) = 1848 \u00b1 12 (stat) \u00b1 67 (syst + lumi) pb, in agreement with the standard model expectation, computed at next-to-next-to-leading order accuracy in perturbative quantum chromodynamics. The measurement is used to validate new analysis techniques relevant for future measurements of \u03c4 lepton production. The measurement also provides the reconstruction efficiency and energy scale for \u03c4 decays to hadrons + \u03bd \u03c4 final states, determined with respective relative uncertainties of 2.2 and 0.9%.",

Approximately two thirds of \u03c4 leptons decay into a hadronic system and a \u03c4 neutrino. Constrained by the \u03c4 lepton mass of 1.777 GeV, the hadronic system is characterized by low particle multiplicities, typically consisting of either one or three charged pions or kaons, and up to two neutral pions. The hadrons produced in \u03c4 decays therefore also tend to be highly collimated. The \u03c4 lepton decays into an electron or muon and two neutrinos with a probability of 35%.

First, the process Z/\u03b3 * \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 represents a reference signal to study the efficiency to reconstruct and identify \u03c4 h , as well as to measure the \u03c4 h energy scale. Moreover, Z/\u03b3 * \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 production constitutes the dominant irreducible background to analyses of SM H \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 events, and to searches for new resonances decaying to \u03c4 lepton pairs. The cross section for DY production exceeds the one for SM H production by about two orders of magnitude. Signals from new resonances are expected to be even more rare. It is therefore important to control with a precision reaching the sub-percent level the rate for Z/\u03b3 * \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 production, as well as its distribution in kinematic observables. In addition, the reducible backgrounds relevant for the study of Z/\u03b3 * \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 are also relevant for studies of SM H production and to searches for new resonances.",

A silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL), and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter (HCAL), each composed of a barrel and two endcap sections, are positioned within the solenoid volume. The silicon tracker measures charged particles within the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 2.5. Trajectories of isolated muons with p T = 100 GeV, emitted at |\u03b7| < 1.4, are reconstructed with an efficiency close to 100% and resolutions of 2.8% in p T , and with uncertainties of 10 and 30 \u00b5m in their respective transverse and longitudinal impact parameters relative to their points of origin [44]. The ECAL is a finegrained hermetic calorimeter with quasi-projective geometry, segmented in the barrel region of |\u03b7| < 1.48, as well as in the two endcaps that extend up to |\u03b7| < 3.0. Similarly, the HCAL barrel and endcaps cover the region |\u03b7| < 3.0. Forward calorimeters extend the coverage up to |\u03b7| < 5.0. Muons are measured and identified in the range |\u03b7| < 2.4 using gas-ionization detectors embedded in the steel fluxreturn yoke outside the solenoid. A two-level trigger system is used to reduce the rate of recorded events to a level suitable for data acquisition and storage. The first level (L1) of the CMS trigger system, composed of specialized hardware processors, uses information from the calorimeters and muon detectors to select the most interesting events in a fixed time interval of less than 4 \u00b5s. The high-level trigger processor farm decreases the event rate from around 100 kHz to less than 1 kHz before storage and subsequent analysis. Details of the CMS detector and its performance, together with a definition of the coordinate system and kinematic variables, can be found in Ref. [45].",

Background contributions arising from multijet production via quantum chromodynamic interactions are determined from data. The Z/\u03b3 * \u2192 (where refers to e, \u03bc, or \u03c4 ) and W+jets events are generated using leading-order (LO) matrix elements (ME) in quantum chromodynamics, implemented in the program Mad-Graph5_amc@nlo 2.2.2 [46], and tt and single top quark events are generated using the next-to-leading order (NLO) program powheg v2 [47][48][49][50][51]. The diboson events are modelled using the NLO ME program implemented in Mad-Graph5_amc@nlo. The background events are complemented with SM H \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 events, generated for an H mass of m H = 125 GeV, using the implementation of the gluongluon and vector boson fusion processes in powheg [52,53]. All events are generated using the NNPDF3.0 [54][55][56] set of parton distribution functions (PDF). Parton showers and parton hadronization are modelled using pythia 8.212 [57] and the CUETP8M1 underlying-event tune [58], which is based on the Monash tune [59]. The decays of \u03c4 leptons, including polarization effects, are modelled through pythia. The Z/\u03b3 * \u2192 , W+jets, and tt events are normalized to cross sections computed at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) accuracy [60,61]. A reweighting is applied to MC-generated tt and Z/\u03b3 * \u2192 events to improve the respective modelling of the p T spectrum of the top quarks [62,63] and the dilepton mass and p T spectra relative to data. The weights applied to simulated Z/\u03b3 * \u2192 events are obtained from studies of the distributions in dilepton mass and p T in Z/\u03b3 * \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc events.

Isolated leptons are distinguished from leptons in jets through a sum, denoted by the symbol I , of the scalar p T values of additional charged particles, neutral hadrons, and photons reconstructed using the PF algorithm within a cone in \u03b7 and azimuth \u03c6 (in radians) of size \u0394R = \u221a (\u0394\u03b7) 2 + (\u0394\u03c6) 2 = 0.3, centred around the lepton direction. Neutral hadrons and photons within the innermost region of the cone, \u0394R < 0.01, are excluded from the isolation sum for muons to prevent the footprint of the muon in ECAL and HCAL from causing the muon to fail isolation criteria. When computing the isolation of electrons reconstructed in the ECAL endcap region, we exclude photons within \u0394R < 0.08 and charged particles within \u0394R < 0.015 of the direction of the electron, to avoid counting photons emitted in bremsstrahlung and tracks originating from the conversion of such photons. As the amount of material that electrons traverse in the barrel region before reaching the ECAL is smaller, the resulting probability for bremsstrahlung emission and photon conversion is sufficiently reduced so as not to require exclusion of particles in the innermost cone from the isolation sum. Efficiency loss due to pileup is kept minimal by considering only charged particles originating from the lepton production vertex (\"charged from PV\"). The contribution from the neutral component of pileup to the isolation of the lepton is taken into account by means of \u0394\u03b2 corrections [69], which enter the computation of the isolation I , as follows:",

The \u03c4 h candidates are constructed by combining the charged PF hadrons with neutral pions. The neutral pions are reconstructed by clustering the PF photons within rectangular strips, narrow in the \u03b7, but wide in the \u03c6 directions, to account for the nonnegligible probability for photons produced in \u03c0 0 \u2192 \u03b3 \u03b3 decays to convert into electron-positron pairs when traversing the all-silicon tracking detector of CMS and the broadening of energy depositions in the ECAL that occurs when this happens. For the same reason, electrons and positrons reconstructed through the PF algorithm are considered in the reconstruction of the neutral pions besides photons. The momentum of the \u03c4 h candidate is taken as the vector sum over the momenta of the charged hadrons and neutral pions used in reconstructing the \u03c4 h decay mode, assuming the pion-mass hypotheses. We do not use the strips of 0.20 \u00d7 0.05 size in the \u03b7-\u03c6 plane, used in previous analyses [5][6][7][9][10][11][12][13]18,[21][22][23][29][30][31]33,34,38,43], but an improved version of the strip reconstruction developed during the \u221a s = 13 TeV run. In the improved version, the size of the strip is adjusted as function of p T , taking into consideration the bending of charged particles in the magnetic field increasing inversely with p T . More details on strip reconstruction and validation of the algorithm with data are given in Ref. [75]. The main handle for distinguishing \u03c4 h from the large background of quark and gluon jets relies on the use of tight isolation requirements. The sums of scalar p T values from photons and from charged particles originating from the PV within a cone of \u0394R = 0.5 centred around the \u03c4 h direction, are used as input to an MVA-based \u03c4 h ID discriminant. The set of input variables is complemented with the scalar p T sum of charged particles not originating from the PV, by the \u03c4 h decay mode, and by observables that are sensitive to the lifetime of the \u03c4 . The transverse impact parameter of the \"leading\" (highest p T ) track of each \u03c4 h candidate relative to the PV is used for \u03c4 h candidates reconstructed in any decay mode. For \u03c4 h candidates reconstructed in the \u03c4 \u2212 \u2192 h \u2212 h + h \u2212 \u03bd \u03c4 decay mode, a fit of the three tracks to a common secondary vertex (SV) is attempted, and the distance between SV and PV is used as additional input to the MVA. The MVA is trained on genuine \u03c4 h and jets generated in MC simulation. Four working points (WP), referred to as barely, minimally, moderately, and tightly constrained, are defined through changes made in the selections on the MVA output. The thresholds are adjusted as functions of the p T of the \u03c4 h candidate, such that the \u03c4 h identification efficiency for each WP is independent of p T . The moderate and tight WP used to select events in different channels provide efficiencies of 55 and 45%, and misidentification rates for jets of typically 1 and 0.5%, depending on the p T of the jet [75]. Additional discriminants are employed to separate \u03c4 h from electrons and muons. The separation of \u03c4 h from electrons is performed via another MVA-based discriminant [75] that utilizes input observables that quantify the matching between the sum of energy depositions in the ECAL and the momentum of the leading track of the \u03c4 h candidate, as well as variables that distinguish electromagnetic from hadronic showers.

The trigger selects events containing two isolated calorimeter energy deposits at the L1 trigger stage, which are subsequently required to pass a simplified version of the PF-based offline \u03c4 h reconstruction at the high-level trigger stage. The latter applies additional isolation criteria. The p T threshold for both \u03c4 h candidates is 35 GeV. The trigger efficiency increases with p T of the \u03c4 h , because different algorithms are used to reconstruct the p T at the L1 trigger stage and in the offline reconstruction. The trigger reaches an efficiency plateau of \u2248 80% for events in which both \u03c4 h candidates have p T > 60 GeV. Selected events are required to contain two \u03c4 h candidates with p T > 40 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.1 that have opposite charge and satisfy the tight WP of the MVA-based \u03c4 h ID discriminant, as well as the minimal criteria on the discriminants used to separate \u03c4 h from electrons and muons. Events containing electrons with p T > 10 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.5 or muons with p T > 10 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.4, passing minimal identification and isolation criteria, are rejected to avoid overlap with the \u03c4 e \u03c4 h and \u03c4 \u03bc \u03c4 h channels.",

            "text": "The accuracy of the background estimate is improved by determining from data the contributions from the main backgrounds, as well as from backgrounds that are difficult to model through MC simulation. In particular, the background from multijet production falls into the latter category. In the \u03c4 e \u03c4 h , \u03c4 \u03bc \u03c4 h , and \u03c4 h \u03c4 h channels, the dominant background is from events in which a quark or gluon jet is misidentified as \u03c4 h . The estimation of background from these \"false\" \u03c4 h sources is discussed in Sect. 6.1. It predominantly arises from multijet production in the \u03c4 h \u03c4 h channel and from W+jets events, as well as from multijet production in the \u03c4 e \u03c4 h and \u03c4 \u03bc \u03c4 h channels. A small additional background contribution in the \u03c4 e \u03c4 h , \u03c4 \u03bc \u03c4 h , and \u03c4 h \u03c4 h channels arises from tt events with quark or gluon jets misidentified as \u03c4 h . The multijet background is also relevant in the \u03c4 e \u03c4 \u03bc and \u03c4 \u03bc \u03c4 \u03bc channels. The estimation of the multijet background in these channels is described in Sect. 6.2. The contribution to the SR from the \u03c4 e \u03c4 \u03bc and \u03c4 \u03bc \u03c4 \u03bc channels arising from backgrounds with misidentified leptons other than multijet production is small and not distinguished from background contributions with genuine leptons. Significant background contributions arise from tt production in the \u03c4 e \u03c4 \u03bc channel and from the DY production of muon pairs in the \u03c4 \u03bc \u03c4 \u03bc channel. The normal-ization of the tt background in the \u03c4 e \u03c4 \u03bc and \u03c4 \u03bc \u03c4 \u03bc channels is determined from data, using a control region that contains events with one electron, one muon, and one or more b-tagged jets. Details of the procedure are given in Sect. 6.3. The tt normalization factor obtained from this control region is also applied to the tt background events selected in the \u03c4 e \u03c4 h , \u03c4 \u03bc \u03c4 h , and \u03c4 h \u03c4 h channels, in which the reconstructed \u03c4 h is either due to a genuine \u03c4 h or due to the misidentification of an electron or muon. The background rate from Z/\u03b3 * \u2192 ee and Z/\u03b3 * \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc production is determined from the data through a maximum-likelihood (ML) fit of the m \u03c4 \u03c4 distributions in the SR, described in Sect. 8. The contributions of minor backgrounds from single top quark and diboson production, as well as a small contribution from W+jets background in the \u03c4 e \u03c4 \u03bc and \u03c4 \u03bc \u03c4 \u03bc channels, are obtained from MC simulation. The sum of these minor backgrounds is referred to as \"electroweak\" background. A Higgs boson with a mass of m H = 125 GeV, produced at the rate and with branching fractions predicted in the SM, is considered as background. Nevertheless, this contribution is found to be negligible.",

The DR dominated by multijet background contains events in which the charges of the \u03c4 h candidate and of the light lepton candidates are the same, and the electron or muon satisfies a modified isolation criterion of 0.05 < I / p T < 0.15. Depending on whether the \u03c4 h candidate passes or fails the moderate WP of the MVA-based \u03c4 h ID discriminant, the event contributes either to the numerator or to the denominator of Eq. (5). The DR dominated by W+jets background is defined by modifying the requirement for the transverse mass of lep-ton and p miss T to m T > 70 GeV. The contamination arising from tt background is reduced by vetoing events containing jets that pass the b tagging criteria described in Sect. 4. A common tt DR is used for the \u03c4 e \u03c4 h and \u03c4 \u03bc \u03c4 h channels. The events are required to contain an electron, a muon, at least one \u03c4 h candidate, and pass triggers based on the presence of an electron or a muon. The offline event selection demands that the electron satisfy the conditions p T > 13 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.5, the muon p T > 10 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.4, and that both pass an isolation criterion of I < 0.10 p T . The event is furthermore required to contain at least one jet that passes the b tagging criteria described in Sect. 4. In case events contain multiple \u03c4 h candidates, the candidate used for the F F measurement is chosen at random.",

The multijet DR is identical to the SR of the \u03c4 h \u03c4 h channel, except that the two \u03c4 h candidates are required to have the same rather than opposite charge. One of the jets is chosen to be the \"tag\" jet, and required to pass the tight WP of the MVA-based \u03c4 h ID discriminant, while the measurement of the F F is performed on the other jet, referred to as the \"probe\" jet. The tag jet is chosen at random. The W+jets and tt backgrounds are small in the \u03c4 h \u03c4 h channel, making it difficult to define a DR that is dominated by these backgrounds, or that provides sufficient statistical information for the F F measurement. The F F in the multijet DR of the \u03c4 h \u03c4 h channel are therefore used to weight all events selected in the AR of the \u03c4 h \u03c4 h channel. Differences in the F F between W+jets, tt, and multijet events are accounted for by adding a systematic uncertainty of 30% on the part of the background from misidentified \u03c4 h expected from the contribution of W+jets and tt background processes. This contribution is estimated using MC simulation, and the magnitude of the systematic uncertainty is motivated by the difference found in the F F measured in multijet, W+jets, and tt DR in the \u03c4 e \u03c4 h and \u03c4 \u03bc \u03c4 h channels.",

A correction for the extrapolation from events in which the charges of lepton and \u03c4 h candidate have the same sign (SS) to events in which they have opposite sign (OS) is obtained by comparing F F in the SS and OS events containing electrons or muons that pass an inverted isolation criterion of 0.1 < I / p T < 0.2.

An estimate for the contribution from multijet events in the SR is obtained by scaling the yield of the multijet background in the SS control region by a suitably chosen extrapolation factor, defined by the ratio of e\u03bc or \u03bc\u03bc pairs with opposite charge to those with same charge. The ratio is measured in events in which at least one lepton passes an inverted isolation criterion of I > 0.15 p T . We refer to this event sample as an isolation sideband region (SB). The requirement I > 0.15 p T ensures that the SB does not overlap with the SR. A complication arises from the fact that the ratio of OS to SS pairs depends on the lepton kinematics and the isolation criterion used in the SB. The nominal OS/SS ratio is measured in an isolation sideband (SB1) defined by requiring both leptons to satisfy a relaxed isolation criterion of I < 0.60 p T , with at least one lepton passing the condition I > 0.15 p T . The systematic uncertainty in the OS/SS ratio that arises from the choice of the upper limit on I applied in SB1 is estimated by taking the difference between the OS/SS ratio computed in SB1 and the ratio computed in a different isolation sideband region (SB2). The latter is defined by requiring at least one lepton to pass the condition I > 0.60 p T , without setting an upper limit on I in the SB2 region. The criteria to select events in the isolation sidebands are optimized to ensure high statistical accuracy in the measurement of the OS/SS extrapolation factor and at the same time the minimization of differences in lepton kinematic distributions between the SR and the SB.",

The probability for electrons and muons to pass the tight-electron or tight-muon removal criteria applied, respectively, in the \u03c4 e \u03c4 h and \u03c4 \u03bc \u03c4 h channels is measured in Z/\u03b3 * \u2192 ee and in Z/\u03b3 * \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc events. The misidentification rates depend on \u03b7. For electrons in the ECAL barrel and endcap regions, the misidentifications are at respective levels of 0.2 and 0.1%, with accuracies of 13 and 29% [75]. The misidentification rate for muons lies between less than one and several tenths of a percent, and is known to within an uncertainty of 30%. The contribution from W+jets background in the \u03c4 e \u03c4 \u03bc and \u03c4 \u03bc \u03c4 \u03bc channels is modelled using MC simulation, and is known to an accuracy of 15%.

The quoted uncertainties include the effect of missing higher-order terms in the perturbative expansion for the calculated cross section, estimated through indepen-dent changes in the renormalization and factorization scales by factors of 2 and 1/2 relative to their nominal equal values [92,93], uncertainties in the NNPDF3.0 set of PDF, estimated following the recommendations given in Ref.

            "text": "The symbol\u0398 \u03be denotes the values of nuisance parameters that maximize the likelihood for a given value of \u03be . The combination of\u03be and\u0398 correspond to the values of \u03be and \u0398 for which the likelihood function reaches its maximum. The 68% CI is defined by the values of \u03be for which \u2212 2 ln \u03bb (\u03be ) increases by one unit relative to its minimum. To quantify the effects from individual statistical uncertainties, the uncertainty in the integrated luminosity, and other systematic uncertainties, we ignore some single source of uncertainties at a time, and recompute the 68% CI. The nuisance parameters \u03b8 k corresponding to uncertainties that are ignored are fixed at the values\u03b8 k that yield the best fit to the data. The square root of the quadratic difference between the CI, computed for all sources of uncertainties in the fit, and for the case that some given source is ignored, reflects the estimate of the uncertainty in the POI resulting from a single source. The procedure is illustrated in Fig. 9 for the combined fit of 2.3 fb Fig. 9 Dependence of \u2212 2 ln \u03bb (\u03be ) on the cross section \u03be for DY production of \u03c4 pairs. The PLR is computed for the simultaneous ML fit to the observed m \u03c4 \u03c4 distributions in the \u03c4 e \u03c4 h , \u03c4 \u03bc \u03c4 h , \u03c4 h \u03c4 h , \u03c4 e \u03c4 \u03bc , and \u03c4 \u03bc \u03c4 \u03bc channels. The dashed, dash-dotted, and solid curves correspond to situations when just the statistical uncertainties are used in the fit, when the uncertainty in integrated luminosity is also included, and when all uncertainties are included in the fit. The values of nuisance parameters, corresponding to uncertainties that are ignored, are fixed at the values that yield the best fit to the data. The horizontal line represents the value of \u2212 2 ln \u03bb (\u03be ) that is used to determine the 68% CI on \u03be all five final states. Correlations among different sources of uncertainty are estimated through this procedure. The cross section for DY production of \u03c4 pairs is quoted within the mass window 60 < m true \u03c4 \u03c4 < 120 GeV. The contribution from Z/\u03b3 * \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 events that pass the selection criteria described in Sect. 5, but have a mass outside of this window is at the level of a few percent in the \u03c4 e \u03c4 h , \u03c4 \u03bc \u03c4 h , \u03c4 e \u03c4 \u03bc , and \u03c4 \u03bc \u03c4 \u03bc channels. In the \u03c4 h \u03c4 h channel, this contribution from outside of the mass window is \u2248 40%, the reason for this being so large is the high p T threshold on the \u03c4 h candidates required in the trigger. The Z/\u03b3 * \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 events that have two \u03c4 h with p T > 40 GeV contain either a Z boson of high p T or a \u03c4 lepton pair above the mass of the Z boson. Table 3 Yields expected in Z/\u03b3 * \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 signal events and backgrounds in the \u03c4 e \u03c4 h , \u03c4 \u03bc \u03c4 h , \u03c4 h \u03c4 h , \u03c4 e \u03c4 \u03bc , and \u03c4 \u03bc \u03c4 \u03bc channels, obtained from the ML fit described in Sect. 8. The uncertainties are rounded to two significant digits, except when they are < 10, in which case they are rounded to one significant digit, and the event yields are rounded to match the precision in the uncertainties. The analysed data corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 2.3 fb \u22121 Events / 10 GeV Only a small fraction of signal events pass either of these two conditions, which leads to the smallest event yield from the Z/\u03b3 * \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 signal in the \u03c4 h \u03c4 h channel (as shown in Table 3), and to the largest fraction of signal events containing a \u03c4 lepton pair of mass outside of the 60 < m true \u03c4 \u03c4 < 120 GeV window.",

Events passing the single-muon trigger are selected by the presence of two muons of opposite charge passing tight identification and isolation criteria. At least one of the muons is required to have p T > 20 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.1, while the other muon is required to satisfy the conditions p T > 10 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.4. The number  of Z/\u03b3 * \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc candidate events selected in the different categories in data is compared to the MC expectation for Z/\u03b3 * \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc production, and their ratio is used as a scale factor to correct the MC expectation for the Z/\u03b3 * \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 event yield in that category. The expected contribution of background processes, obtained from MC simulation, is subtracted from the data before taking the ratio. The selection criteria applied on muon p T and \u03b7 in Z/\u03b3 * \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc, and on p T and \u03b7 of the visible \u03c4 decay products in Z/\u03b3 * \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 events are known to cause a bias in the p Z T distribution. The latter is correlated with the multiplicity of jets. The bias must be corrected, as its magnitude is very different for Z/\u03b3 * \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc and Z/\u03b3 * \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 events. The bias is emulated by replacing the muons reconstructed in Z/\u03b3 * \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc candidate events with generator-level \u03c4 leptons. The \u03c4 leptons are decayed using tauola++ 1.1.4 [99,100], and effects of \u03c4 lepton polarization in the decays are modelled through weights computed with the TauSpinner [101] program. A sample of 1000 random \u03c4 lepton decays is generated for each Z/\u03b3 * \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc candidate event, and the weights computed in TauSpinner are recorded for each decay. The ratio of the sum of the weights for decays in which the visible products of both \u03c4 leptons pass selection criteria on p T and \u03b7, to the sum of all weights computed for the 1000 decays, is applied as event weight to the Z/\u03b3 * \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc candidate, which corrects for the difference in bias of p Z T caused by selection criteria on between Z/\u03b3 * \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc and Z/\u03b3 * \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 events. The procedure is validated through MC simulation. The contributions of background processes that are modelled in the MC simulation to the different categories are affected by uncertainties in the jet energy scale and resolution. The energy scale of jets is measured using the p T balance of jets with Z bosons and photons in Z/\u03b3 * \u2192 ee and Z/\u03b3 * \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc and \u03b3 +jets events and the p T balance between jets in dijet events as described in Ref. [79]. The uncertainty in the jet energy scale is a few percent and depends on p T and \u03b7. The impact of jet energy scale and resolution uncertainties on the yields of background processes is evaluated by varying the jet energy scale and resolution within their uncertainties, redetermining the multiplicity of jets and b jets, and reapplying the event categorization conditions given in Table 5.",
