The measurement shows a clear direct-photon signal for 0-40% most central collisions below 4 GeV/c that can not be described by next-to-leading-order perturbative QCD (NLO pQCD) calculations. Above this value of p T the result is in agreement with pQCD predictions. The low p T signal is expected to have thermal photon contributions. The inverse slope parameter of an exponential fit is extracted as T LHC = 304\u00b151 syst+stat MeV. For a baseline measurement the analysis is performed for protonproton collisions at \u221a s = 7 TeV and for peripheral (40-80%) Pb-Pb collisions. Both results show no low p T direct-photon signal and are in agreement with pQCD calculations.",

In pp collisions, leading order pQCD processes, quark-gluon compton-scattering and quark-anti-quark annihilation are the main components of direct-photon production at high p T . The second source is photons produced in yet fragmentation [1]. In heavy-ion collisions these prompt photons should be enhanced by the larger number of binary collisions. They may be modified by isospin effects and nuclear shadowing. Fragmentation photons are affected by jet quenching; saturation effects may lead to further modifications for both sources [2,3].",
