            "text": "Searches conducted at LEP2 have excluded the standard model (SM) Higgs boson decaying into bb or \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 for masses below 114.4 GeV/c 2 [1]. The LEP experiments observed a small excess in the bb final state for a Higgs boson mass around 100 GeV/c 2 , which is consistent with background fluctuations or SM-like production with a reduced branching ratio into bb [2,3]. This excess, the mild tension with electroweak precision tests [4], and the fine-tuning needed in the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) have prompted the consideration of models with exotic Higgs boson decays, such as those of the next-to-minimal supersymmetric standard model (NMSSM) [5,6] as well as more general frameworks [7,8]. In these models, new decay channels can dominate over h \u2192 bb and render the Higgs boson \"invisible\" for conventional searches. In particular, a Higgs boson decaying into two light pseudoscalars is well motivated by these models and results in a four-body final state as the pseudoscalars decay into light fermions. Scenarios with a dominant h \u2192 2a \u2192 4b decay are constrained by the LEP experiments for mass up to 110 GeV/c 2 [2,9,10]. A general search for h \u2192 aa with a \u2192 gg, cc, \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 was performed by the OPAL Collaboration [11], but the analysis was restricted to a Higgs boson mass, m h , in the range 45-86 GeV/c 2 . A search for h \u2192 2a \u2192 2\u00b52\u03c4 was recently reported by the D0 Collaboration, which resulted in limits that are a factor of 1-4 larger than the expected production cross section assuming branching ratios of the pseudoscalar as predicted by the NMSSM [12]. In this paper, a search using ALEPH data is presented for h \u2192 2a \u2192 4\u03c4 up to m h \u2248 110 GeV/c 2 .",

Given that each jet is expected to arise from the on-shell decay a \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 , an effective way to target the signal topology is to use the jade algorithm with y cut chosen to merge protojets up to a mass of m jet = 15 GeV/c 2 . This technique allows for an accurate clustering of the two tau pairs separately, thus rendering individual tau identification unnecessary and making track-multiplicity an effective discriminator against background. Because the taus from the same a decay are highly collimated, the identification of jets containing the decay products of two taus was based only on the track multiplicity of the jets, denoted n track i , with the index i ordered in decreasing jet energy. Because the tau predominantly decays either to one charged particle (\"one-prong\" decay) or three charged particles (\"three-prong\" decay), each jet is expected to contain two, four, or six tracks. To maximize the tracking efficiency, the jets were required to be well contained in the tracking volume. No distinction was made between leptonic and hadronic decays.",

A joint probability density was constructed to describe the number of events in each of three jet-multiplicity pairings (indexed by m) for each of the three final states (indexed by f ). The three jetmultiplicity pairings correspond to the different permutations of one-prong and three-prong tau decays in each of the jets, ignoring those with six tracks in an individual jet, leaving the three permutations (n track 1 , n track 2 ) \u2208 {(2, 2), (2,4) or (4,2), (4,4)} \u2261 M. The event count N m,f in each of these nine categories was modeled with a Poisson distribution about the sum of the uncertain background b m,f and the expected signal s m,f scaled by \u03be 2 . A normal distribution was used to model the relationship between the uncertain background, the Monte Carlo-based background estimate b MC m,f , and its systematic uncertainty \u2206 f . This procedure leads to the following joint probability density for the event counts:",
