The tau candidates were identified from their decays into electrons, muons or hadronic jets. The number of tau-pair candidates has been compared with the prediction from the Standard Model, where the largest contribution is expected from Bethe-Heitler processes. The total visible cross section was extracted. Standard Model expectations agree well with the measured distributions, also at high invariant mass of the tau pair.",

            "text": "The production of isolated-lepton pairs at the ep collider HERA is dominated by the twophoton Bethe-Heitler process, \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 l + l \u2212 , and can be accurately predicted in the Standard Model (SM) [1]. Possible deviations of the event yield or final-state distributions from the prediction of the SM could be a hint for new physics. The measurement of multi-lepton production at HERA attracted some interest, especially after the observation of an excess of events at high mass in multi-electron final states, observed by the H1 Collaboration in the HERA I (1994)(1995)(1996)(1997)(1998)(1999)(2000) data [2]. Recently, the H1 and ZEUS Collaborations have published [3][4][5] a study of multi-electron and multi-muon events based on the entire statistics collected at HERA. Further investigations of multi-lepton events were performed in tau-pair production by H1 [6], based on the HERA I data.",

The scattered electron is observed in the calorimeter only for high virtuality of the photon at the electron vertex, Q 2 . The proton either stays intact (elastic reaction, X = p) or dissociates into a resonant (quasi-elastic) or hadronic system (inelastic). In order to suppress the dominant backgrounds from deep inelastic scattering (DIS) neutral current (NC), ep \u2192 eX, and photoproduction, \u03b3p \u2192 X, only events where no deposit was observed in the forward part of the calorimeter were selected. The dominant signal process (\u2243 71% estimated from Monte Carlo simulation after all selection cuts) was therefore the elastic reaction ep \u2192 (e)p\u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 , where the final-state proton stays intact. The quasi-elastic reaction was the second most important contribution (\u2243 27%). In this case the final-state proton dissociates into a system with small invariant mass, escaping in the forward beam pipe. The contribution of events ep \u2192 e\u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 X, in which the scattered electron was observed in the calorimeter, was determined to be only \u2243 1% after all analysis cuts. The two tau leptons were identified from their decays into an electron, a muon or hadrons, respectively, resulting in the final-state signatures listed in table 1. The topologies in which the two tau leptons both decayed into either electrons or muons were not considered, due to the irreducible background of dielectron and dimuon processes. Hadronic decays give rise to narrow and low-multiplicity jets; these characteristics allowed tau decays to be distinguished from the much more abundant QCD-induced jets, as described in section 4.3.",

In contrast, QCDinduced hadronic jets are typically broader and have higher multiplicity. These properties were exploited to discriminate tau jets from QCD jets using a multi-variate discrimination technique [31] which was used in a previous publication [7]. The jet shape was characterised by six variables. Five of these variables were the same as those used in previous analyses [7,32]: the first and the second moment of the radial extension of the jet-energy deposition (R mean and R rms , respectively); the first moment of the energy deposition in the direction along the jet axis (L mean ); the number of subjets within the jet resolved with JHEP02(2011)117 a resolution criterion y cut [33] of 5 \u2022 10 \u22124 (N subj ); and the mass of the jet calculated from the CAL cells associated with the jet (M jet ). The sixth variable, which was used for this analysis, was the sum of the distances in the \u03b7-\u03c6 plane between the jet axis and the tracks associated with the jet,",

For any given jet with phase-space coordinate x, the signal and the background densities were evaluated from the number of corresponding simulated signal and background jets in a 6-dimensional box of fixed size centred around x. Figure 1 shows the six discriminant variables for the data, compared to those of the sum of the MC expectations, where all cuts described in this section, except the discriminant cut, were applied. The MC agrees well with the data, both in shape and in normalisation. The discriminant variable is shown in figure 2 for each jet in each decay channel. As expected, the ditau signal MC dominates at large values of D, while the background from the other processes populates the lower values of D. In order to select the hadronic tau decays, a cut on the discriminant greater than 0.8 was applied on each tau-candidate jet.",

The tau leptons were identified through their decays into electrons, muons or jets, with transverse momentum greater than 2 GeV (for an e or a \u00b5) or 5 GeV (for a jet). The jet coming from the hadronic tau decay was identified with a multi-variate discrimination technique employed to separate the signal from the QCD background. The selected events were dominated by the Bethe-Heitler \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 process and the final-state topologies (e-)jet-jet, (e-)e-jet, (e-)e-\u00b5 and (e-)\u00b5-jet were considered. In total, 25 events were selected, compared to a MC expectation of 34. , and (b) the scalar sum of the transverse momenta of the two tau candidates, p visible T , \u03c4 \u03c4 . The selected e-e-jet event has two entries in the plots, one for each electronjet combination. The data (dots) are compared with the predictions of the sum of the Monte Carlo expectations and to the ditau MC only. The shaded bands show the systematic uncertainty on the SM expectation. mass of the tau pair. Therefore, no evidence of physics beyond the Standard Model is found for tau-pair production. The total cross section, in the kinematic region p \u03c4 1,2 T > 5 GeV and 17 \u2022 < \u03b8 \u03c4 1,2 < 160 \u2022 , was measured to be \u03c3 kin \u03c4 \u03c4 = 3.3 \u00b1 1.3(stat.) +1.0 \u22120.7 (syst.) pb.",
