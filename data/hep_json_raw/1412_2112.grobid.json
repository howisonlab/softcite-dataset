Studies of heavy quark production in p+p collisions can test the validity of perturbative QCD. They also provide a baseline to study the effects of nuclear matter on the production of heavy quarks in heavy ion collisions. In this paper, we present recent results of NPE spectra measured in p+p collisions at \u221a s = 200 GeV in mid-rapidity. We also report NPE nuclear modification factor RAA and elliptic flow v2 in Au+Au collisions at \u221a sNN = 200 GeV.",

Due to their large masses, they are produced mainly during initial hard parton scatterings at RHIC, before the QGP phase. They are expected to interact with the medium differently from the light quarks. Hot nuclear matter effects, such as heavy quark inteactions with the QGP, change the heavy quark kinematic distribution but do not change the total heavy quark yield. Due to energy loss of heavy quarks in the QGP, their transverse momentum p T distributions in heavy ion collisions may fall steeper than those in p+p collisions. At small p T , heavy quarks may thermalize with the medium and exhibit collective flow effects [1].",

The NPE invariant yields were compared with FONLL calculations scaled by the average number of binary collisions in five centrality bins. In central and semicentral Au+Au collisions we observed a suppresion of NPE production compared to the FONLL calculation [2]. Figure 2 (left) shows NPE R AA for the 0-10% most central collisions compared to several theoretical models of heavy quark energy loss [5]- [9]. Gluon radiation scenario alone [5] (dashed green line) fails to explain the large NPE suppression at high p T . When the collisional energy loss is added model calculations describe the data better. The collisional dissociation model [8] (red line) and the AdS/CFT calculation [9] (blue line) also describe the data well. Note that the baseline for nuclear modification factor calculation is produced from a combination of NPE spectra measured in the years 2005 and 2008 [3]. By including the aforementioned new p+p results from 2009 data, the R AA uncertainties will be reduced.  Figure 1.
