            "text": "Neutrinos are strictly massless within the Standard Model (SM), due to the absence of right-handed neutrino states. However, since the observation of neutrino oscillations has unambiguously demonstrated the massive nature of neutrinos, right-handed neutrino states must be included. A natural extension of the SM involves the inclusion of sterile neutrinos which mix with ordinary neutrinos: an example is the Neutrino Minimal Standard Model (\u03bdMSM) [1,2]. In this model, three massive right-handed neutrinos are introduced to explain neutrino oscillations, dark matter and baryon asymmetry of the Universe: the lightest one with a mass O(1 keV/c 2 ) is a dark matter candidate; the other two with masses O(100 MeV/c 2 ) are responsible for the masses of the SM neutrinos (via the see-saw mechanism) and introduce extra CP violating phases to account for baryon asymmetry. The \u03bdMSM can be further extended by adding a scalar field to incorporate inflation and provide a common source for electroweak symmetry breaking and right-handed neutrino masses [3]. The new particles predicted by these models can be produced in kaon decays. In particular, the Lepton Number Violating (LNV) K \u00b1 \u2192 \u03c0 \u2213 \u03bc \u00b1 \u03bc \u00b1 decay forbidden in the SM could proceed via an off-shell or an on-shell Majorana neutrino N 4 [4,5], while an inflaton \u03c7 could be produced in the Lepton Number Conserving (LNC) K \u00b1 \u2192 \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03c7 decay, and decay promptly to \u03c7 \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 [6,7].",

A muon detector (MUV), located further downstream, consisted of three 2.7 \u00d7 2.7 m 2 planes of plastic scintillator strips, each preceded by a 80 cm thick iron wall. The strips (aligned horizontally in the first and last planes, vertically in the middle plane) were 2.7 m long and 2 cm thick, and read out by photomultipliers at both ends. The first two planes contained 11 strips, while the third plane consisted of 6 strips. A detailed description of the beamline and the detector can be found in Refs. [22,23].",

At the first level (L1), a coincidence of hits in the two planes of the HOD was required in at least two of the 16 non-overlapping logical regions. The second level (L2) performed online reconstruction of trajectories and momenta of charged particles based on the DCH information. The L2 logic was based on the multiplicities and kinematics of reconstructed tracks and two-track vertices. The overall trigger efficiency for three-track kaon decays was above 98.5% [23].",
