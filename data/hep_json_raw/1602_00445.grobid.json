            "text": "The nature of the excited J PC = 1 \u2212\u2212 cc bound states above the DD threshold is of interest but still not well known. The \u03c8(3770) resonance, as the lightest charmonium state lying above the open charm threshold, is generally assigned to be a dominant 1 3 D 1 momentum eigenstate with a small 2 3 S 1 admixture [1]. It has been thought almost entirely to decay to DD states [2,3]. Unexpectedly, the BES Collaboration found a large inclusive non-DD branching fraction, (14.7 \u00b1 3.2)%, by utilizing various methods [4,5,6,7]. A later work by the CLEO Collaboration found a contradictory non-DD branching fraction,(3.3 \u00b1 1.4 +6.6 \u22124.8 )% [8]. The BES results suggest substantial non-DD decays, although the CLEO result finds otherwise. In the exclusive analyses, various non-DD decay modes have been observed, including hadronic transitions \u03c8(3770) \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 [9,10], \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 J/\u03c8, \u03b7J/\u03c8 [10], the E1 transitions \u03b3\u03c7 cJ (J = 0, 1) [11,12], and the decay to light hadrons \u03c6\u03b7 [13]. The sum of the observed non-DD exclusive components still makes up less than 2% of all decays [14], which motivates the search for other exclusive non-DD final states.",

The decays are dominated by the three-body reaction \u03c7 cJ decaying into \u03c6K * (892)K. The branching fractions for this reaction via neutral and charged K * (892) are measured for the first time.

The observed structure has negative C parity, and is expected to be the h 1 (1380) state, considering its mass, width and decay through K * (892)K. The mass and width of the h 1 (1380) are determined to (1412 \u00b1 4 \u00b1 8) MeV/c 2 and (84 \u00b1 12 \u00b1 40) MeV, respectively.
