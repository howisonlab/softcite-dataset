Compared with the currently used relationships, the present equations, still allowing for reversible processes only, lead to thermodynamic energy thresholds of the bubble chambers employed in dark matter searches that are closer to the experimental values.",

Recently, variants of such detectors are exploited in the search for dark matter in the form of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), the main difference from the standard bubble chambers being the fact that the target liquid is continuously maintained in the metastable superheated state, instead of for just a few milliseconds [2][3][4][5][6][7].",

The minimum amount of energy to be released as a thermal spike to produce a bubble nucleation, typically called critical energy, is generally expressed as the sum of a number of terms, this number varying with the assumptions made by each investigator. Moreover, also the value of the critical bubble radius, which enters directly into the calculation of the critical energy, depends on the assumptions made for its evaluation. Indeed, very often the theoretical values of the critical energy, i.e., the thermodynamic energy thresholds, are lower, sometimes drastically, than the corresponding experimental values. On the other hand, the relatively low threshold needed for WIMP-recoil detection asks to be the most accurate as possible in the prediction of the critical energy required for bubble nucleation, which also helps to provide a correct explanation for why the calibration results give higher thresholds than thermodynamic calculations.",

In many formulations an expansion term is added, mostly to account for the expansion work transferred from the vapour bubble to the surrounding liquid during the vapour bubble formation, while less frequently a term accounting for the kinetic energy imparted by the expanding vapour bubble to the surrounding liquid is also incorporated.

In particular, as seen earlier, the expansion work done by the vapour bubble during its formation is already comprised in the vaporization term. As a matter of fact, the vaporization term consists of both the energy required to break the intermolecular bonds in the liquid, which results in an increased internal energy of the vapour phase, and the energy required to draw the vapour molecules apart, which corresponds to the positive expansion work transferred to the liquid. Thus, all the authors who add an expansion work in the critical energy equation assume that the heat required for the evaporation of the liquid is responsible only for the volume internal energy increase. On the other hand, some authors subtract an expansion term which, assuming that the radius of the vapour bubble grows from 0 to R c , represents the difference between the expansion work executed at the vapour pressure p V and the expansion work executed at the liquid pressure p L , thus resulting in a correction of the vaporization term. In fact, owing to this subtraction, the expansion work per unit mass included in the latent heat of vaporization becomes referred to the equilibrium vapour temperature T V rather than to the liquid temperature T L . Finally, the kinetic energy of the liquid, being the same as the net work done on the liquid once any irreversibility effect is neglected, needs not to be considered.",

In this regard, an alternative approach can be followed by recalling that, when a thermodynamic system kept at constant temperature and pressure can be in more than one equilibrium state, then the stable equilibrium state is the state of lowest free enthalpy, Fig. 2 Distributions of free enthalpies G L and G V vs. T at p = p L also named Gibbs free energy and defined as G = H \u2212 TS, which therefore plays the same role played by the potential energy in defining the stable equilibrium state of a mechanical system [31]. It follows that in the present case the free enthalpy of the superheated liquid G L is necessarily higher than that of the stable vapour G V of an amount G that can also be seen as the free enthalpy variation associated with the formation of a vapour bubble. The situation is schematically displayed in Fig. 2, where typical distributions of G L and G V at the constant pressure p L are plotted versus T. It is apparent that, since G increases as the metastability degree is increased, the assumption of equality of G L and G V may become inaccurate at high degrees of superheat.",

The critical radius R c can then be regarded as the size of the vapour bubble corresponding to the maximum of the function which describes the free enthalpy variation G(r) associated with the formation of a vapour bubble of radius r that nucleates in a metastable liquid kept at constant temperature T L and pressure p L G(r) = H(r) \u2212 T L S(r), (19) which can also be written as the sum of a volume term G vol (r) and a surface term G surf (r) giving",

In fact, according to the measurements performed on liquid Xenon by different research teams -see for example Akerib et al. [39] -the scintillation yield for nuclear recoils between 1 and 100 keV is widely lower than 15%, which lies well inside the indicated 30% uncertainty range.
