The analyzing power A N is just one example of transverse single spin asymmetries, which is expected to be near zero in a leading-twist collinear perturbative QCD description of particle production. The measured cross sections for neutral pions (\u03c0 0 ) produced with large Feynman-x (2p L / \u221a s) and moderate p T in p+p collisions are found to be in agreement with next-to-leading order pQCD calculations at \u221a s = 200 GeV [1,2]. \"Jet-like\" structures are observed in two-particle correlations, involving a forward pion, as expected from pQCD. Precision measurements of the asymmetry as a function of x F and p T were reported, showing large A N at large x F [3]. The measured x F dependence matches the Sivers effect [4,5] expectations qualitatively, while the p T dependence at fixed x F is not consistent with expectations of p-QCD based calculations.",

            "text": "Two concurrent models try to explain the observed asymmetries. The Sivers effect manifests itself as an asymmetry in the forward jet or gamma production while the Collins effect [6] manifests itself as an asymmetry in the forward jet fragmentation. To be able to distinguish between these effects, one has to look beyond inclusive \u03c0 events. Since the Collins effect is an azimuthal modulation of hadrons around the thrust axis of an outgoing quark, integrating over the azimuthal angle would cancel it, leaving only the Sivers effect. This is one possible path to distinguishing the two effects. A first attempt at separating the effects this way was done by looking at \"jet-like\" events at STAR with the FMS detector [7].\"Jet-like\" events are the clustered response of an electromagnetic calorimeter that is primarily sensitive to incident photons, electrons and positrons. The forward detector capabilities during the RHIC running in the year 2006 had sufficient acceptance for \"jet-like\" events. The data obtained were used to separate the Sivers/Collins contributions to the asymmetries observed for the \u03c0 events.",

These detectors, called Forward Pion Detector (FPD) were modular electromagnetic detectors that were positioned to make measurements at < \u03b7 > = 3.3, 3.7 or 4.0. In the year 2006 the FPD detectors placed on the West STAR platform were upgraded to a detector called the Forward Pion Detector ++ (FPD++), a prototype for the later Forward Meson Spectrometer (FMS). The FPD++ consisted of two modules placed symmetrically with respect to the beam line at a distance of 7.4 m from the interaction point, as drawn on Fig. 1. The forward acceptance of STAR has been increased by \u2248 8 times by the FPD++. Each module was built from leadglass detectors of two types: 180 cells of square cross section 5.8 cm on a side and 18 radiation lengths, and 36 cells of square cross section 3.8 cm on a side and 18 radiation lengths. The small cells were placed in the geometrical centers of the modules in square formations. The readout of the FPD++ was triggered when the sum of energies in a small cell module was larger than a threshold. The methodologies developed to calibrate the FPD have been extended to calibrate the FPD++.",

The centroid of the \u03c0 0 peak in the mass distributions is found to increase with leading photon energy. The shower fit for the photons used for reconstruction does not completely account for transverse and longitudinal shower profiles at all energies and causes the reconstructed di-photon invariant mass to be energy dependent. To account for it, energy dependent corrections are applied to give the correct centroid for the \u03c0 0 peak in di-photon invariant mass distributions binned in leading photon energy. Reconstruction of full PYTHIA/GEANT simulations demonstrates that energy dependent corrections correctly reproduce the average energy of the \u03c0 0 when the centroid of the reconstructed di-photon invariant mass is at the measured value. Run-dependent corrections are made to account for small dependence of detector gain on count rate, proportional to luminosity decrease with time in store. Given that the hardware trigger is only sensitive to the small cells, the large cells did not have many events that could be used to calibrate them in the same way as the small cells. To aid in calibration and to have a better understanding of the unpolarized result obtained in the data, full PYTHIA/GEANT simulations have been made with adequate statistics. The large cell calibration started by iteratively matching the slopes of the energy deposition histograms in data and simulations on a cell-by-cell basis. After obtaining the initial correction factors in this way, further calibration was done using the di-photon invariant mass spectra.",

After verifying consistency, a subset of data which contain both a reconstructed \u03c0 and a \"jet-like\" object in a single event was extracted. For that subset, the Collins angle was calculated and the asymmetry dependence on the angle was found.  Comparison of \"jet-like\" event properties with results obtained with the FMS was also examined. \"Jet-like\" clusters are formed in an event by considering energy depositions > 0.4 GeV in all cells of the FPD++. A cluster consists of N cells, where N is the maximal subset of cells found to be within a cone of radius 0.5 in \u03b7 \u2212 \u03c6 space. The x F and p T for the cluster are given by the vector sum of momenta from each cell, assuming the energy deposition is from photons originating from the collision vertex. Clusters with at least 10 cells having cluster p T > 1.5 GeV/c and x F > 0.23 are required in the analysis. A further requirement that the cluster centroid is within the calorimeter volume by at least two large cell widths is also imposed. The properties of the \"jet-like\" events that were looked at were the the energy deposition profile and the invariant mass distributions. The energy profiles show good agreement in the FPD++ and the FMS, as expected since it is a detector independent property. To compare the invariant mass spectra, two differences in the detectors had to be accounted for. The differences lie in the geometry of the detectors, which enters the event selection through a \"weighted multiplicity\" cut, and the hardware trigger of the detectors, which was a hightower trigger in the FMS and a summed module energy trigger in the FPD++. Both differences were modeled in the \"jet-like\" event reconstruction algorithm to be able to compare the results. Good agreement for the jet-mass distributions from the FPD++ and the FMS is found, as seen in Fig. 4.",
