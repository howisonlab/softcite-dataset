            "text": "Recently, in the study of e + e \u2212 \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , a distinct charged structure, named the Z c (3900) \u00b1 , was observed in the J/\u03c8\u03c0 \u00b1 spectrum by BESIII [1] and Belle [2]. Its existence was confirmed shortly thereafter with CLEO-c data [3]. The existence of the neutral partner in the decay Z c (3900) 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c0 0 has also been reported in CLEO-c data [3] and by BESIII [4]. The Z c (3900) is a good candidate for an exotic state beyond simple quark models, since it contains a cc pair and is also electrically charged. Noting that the Z c (3900) has a mass very close to the D * D threshold (3875 MeV), BESIII analyzed the process e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 \u00b1 (DD * ) \u2213 , and a clear structure in the (DD * ) \u2213 mass spectrum is seen, called the Z c (3885). The measured mass and width are (3883.9\u00b11.5\u00b14.2) MeV/c 2 and (24.8 \u00b1 3.3 \u00b1 11.0) MeV, respectively, and quantum numbers J P = 1 + are favored [5]. Assuming the Z c (3885) \u2192 DD * and the Z c (3900) \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c0 signals are from the same source, the ratio of partial widths \u0393(Zc(3885)\u2192DD * ) \u0393(Zc(3900)\u2192J/\u03c8\u03c0) is determined to be 6.",

            "text": "The observation of the Z c (3900) has stimulated many theoretical studies of its nature. Possible interpretations are tetra-quark [6], hadro-charmonium [7], D * D molecule [8] and threshold effects [9][10][11]. Lattice QCD studies provide theoretical support for the existence of X(3872) [12] but not for the Z c (3900) [13][14][15][16][17]. However, those studies were carried out on small volumes with unphysically heavy up and down quarks. It is also worth noting that no resonant structure in J/\u03c8\u03c0 is observed in B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 by LHCb [18], in B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8K \u2212 \u03c0 + by Belle [19] or in \u03b3p \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c0 + n by COMPASS [20]. The decay properties of a state can provide useful information on its internal structure. There are three important decay modes for charmonium-like states: (i) \"fallapart\" decays to open charm mesons; (ii) cascades to hidden charm mesons; and (iii) decays to light hadrons via intermediate gluons. In addition, as shown in Ref. [9,10], an enhancement near the DD * threshold can be produced via rescattering of hidden or open charm final states. Decays of the Z c (3900) to light hadrons can play a unique role in distinguishing a resonance from threshold effects, because the decay mode with cc annihilation involves neither hidden nor open charm final states. However, theory estimates of annihilation widths to light hadrons are only order of magnitude due to uncertainties of wave function effects and QCD corrections [21,22]. A sizeable Z c (3900) decay width to light hadrons might be expected in analogy to \u03b7 c or \u03c7 cJ into hadronic final states.",

We generate signal MC samples of e + e \u2212 \u2192 Z c (3900) \u00b1 \u03c0 \u2213 \u2192 \u03c9\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 uniformly in phase space, where the \u03c9 decays to \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 . The decays of \u03c9 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 are generated with the OMEGA DALITZ model in evtgen [27,28]. Initial state radiation (ISR) is simulated with kkmc [29,30], where the Born cross section of e + e \u2212 \u2192 Z c (3900) \u00b1 \u03c0 \u2213 is assumed to follow a Y (4260) Breit-Wigner (BW) line shape with resonance parameters taken from the Particle Data Group (PDG) [31], in which listed as X(4260). Final state radiation (FSR) effects associated with charged particles are handled with PHOTOS [29]. For studies of possible backgrounds, inclusive Y (4260) MC samples with luminosity equivalent to the experimental data at \u221a s = 4.23 and \u221a s = 4.26 GeV are generated, where the main known decay channels are generated using evtgen [27,28] with branching fractions taken from the PDG [31]. The remaining events associated with charmonium decays are generated with lundcharm [32], while continuum hadronic events are generated with PYTHIA [33]. QED processes such as Bhabha scattering, dimuon and digamma events are generated with kkmc [29,30].",

The luminosity is measured using Bhabha events with an un- certainty of 1.0% [24]. The uncertainty in tracking efficiency for pions is 1.0% per track [5], i.e. 4.0% for the track selection in this analysis. The uncertainty in PID efficiency for pions is 1.0% per track [5]. The uncertainty in the photon reconstruction efficiency is less than 1% per photon [36]. The uncertainty in the \u03c0 0 reconstruction efficiency is 2.0% [37]. The uncertainty of the kinematic fit is estimated by correcting the helix parameters of the charged tracks. The detailed procedure to extract the correction factors can be found in Ref. [38]. The track parameters in MC samples are corrected by these factors, and the difference in efficiencies of 0.8% with and without the correction is taken as the systematic uncertainty associated with the kinematic fit. A MC sample generated with Z c (3900) \u00b1 \u2192 \u03c9\u03c0 \u00b1 in both S wave and D wave, assuming a D/S waves amplitude ratio of 0.1, results in a 3% change in detection efficiency. This difference is taken as the systematic uncertainty associated with the MC production model. The branching ratio value for \u03c9 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 comes from the PDG [31], and its error is 0.8%. In the nominal fit, the radiative correction factor and the detection efficiency are determined under the assumption that the production of e + e \u2212 \u2192 Z c (3900) \u00b1 \u03c0 \u2213 follows the Y (4260) line shape. Using the line shape of \u03c3(e + e \u2212 \u2192 Z c (3900) 0 \u03c0 0 ) measured in Ref. [4] as an alternative assumption, \u01eb(1 + \u03b4) is increased by 6% for \u221a s = 4.23 GeV and 7% for \u221a s = 4.26 GeV . The change in \u01eb(1 + \u03b4) is taken as a systematic uncertainty. The uncertainty of the vacuum polarization factor is taken from Ref. [35], and is negligible compared with other uncertainties. Assuming that all sources of systematic uncertainties are independent, the total errors are given by the quadratic sums.",

            "text": "To estimate the systematic uncertainties due to the fit procedure, we fit under different scenarios, and the upper limits obtained at the 90% C.L. for the Z c (3900) \u00b1 signal yield are summarized in Table II. The effect on the signal yield from the fit range is obtained by varying the fit range by \u00b10.1 GeV/c 2 . The effect due to the choice of the background shape is estimated by changing the background shape from the ARGUS function to a second order polynomial (where the parameters of the polynomial are allowed to vary and the fit range is limited to [3.4, 4.08] GeV/c 2 ). The effect due to the resonance parameters of the Z c (3900) \u00b1 is estimated by varying the resonance parameters according to the results in Ref [5]. The effect due to the mass resolution is estimated by increasing the resolution by 10% according to the comparison between the data and MC. The effect due to the mass-dependent efficiency curve is estimated by changing the efficiency curve to a constant function. We take the largest number of Z c (3900) \u00b1 events in the different scenarios as a conservative estimate of the upper limit:  collected with the BESIII detector operating at the BEPCII storage ring, a search is performed for the decay Z c (3900) \u00b1 \u2192 \u03c9\u03c0 \u00b1 in e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c9\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 . No Z c (3900) \u00b1 signal is observed. The corresponding upper limits on the Born cross section are set to be 0.26 and 0.18 pb at \u221a s = 4.23 and 4.26 GeV, respectively. If we assume that the Z c (3900) \u00b1 observed in e + e \u2212 \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 [1] and Z c (3885) \u00b1 in e + e \u2212 \u2192 (DD * ) \u00b1 \u03c0 \u2213 [5] are the same particle, the decay width of Z c (3900) \u00b1 \u2192 \u03c9\u03c0 \u00b1 is estimated to be smaller than 0.2% of the Z c (3900) \u00b1 total width. As \u03c9\u03c0 is a typical light hadron decay mode of a I G (J P ) = 1 + (1 + ) resonance, the non-observation of Z c (3900) \u00b1 \u2192 \u03c9\u03c0 \u00b1 may indicate that the annihilation of cc in Z c (3900) \u00b1 is suppressed. Complementary to the searches for Z c (3900) production [18][19][20], exploring new Z c (3900) decay modes may provide a significant input to clarify its dynamical origin.",
