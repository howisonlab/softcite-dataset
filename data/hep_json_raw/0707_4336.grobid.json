A partial reconstruction technique is employed to enhance the signal sensitivity. No significant signals were observed. We obtain an upper limit of 4 \u00d7 10 \u22127 at the 90 % confidence level for the branching fractions of the CP violating modes, \u03a5(4S) \u2192 B 0B0 \u2192 J/\u03c8K 0 S + J/\u03c8(\u03b7c)K 0 S . Extrapolating the result, we find that an observation with 5\u03c3 significance is expected with a 30 ab \u22121 data sample, which is within the reach of a future super B factory. CP violation has been established in the neutral kaon system [1] and the neutral B meson system [2]. In the standard model (SM) Kobayashi-Maskawa theory, it arises from an irreducible phase in the weak interaction quark-mixing matrix [3]. This theory predicts that CP violation in the \u03a5(4S) system should also exist.",

The data sample used contains 535 million \u03a5(4S) mesons collected with the Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric-energy e + e \u2212 (3.5 on 8 GeV) collider [6]. The Belle detector is a large-solidangle magnetic spectrometer that consists of a silicon vertex detector (SVD), a 50-layer central drift chamber (CDC), an array of aerogel threshold Cherenkov counters (ACC), a barrel-like arrangement of time-of-flight scintillation counters (TOF), and an electromagnetic calorimeter comprised of CsI(Tl) crystals (ECL) located inside a superconducting solenoid coil that provides a 1.5 T magnetic field. An iron flux-return located outside of the coil is instrumented to detect K 0 L mesons and to identify muons (KLM). The detector is described in detail elsewhere [7]. Two inner detector configurations were used. A 2.0 cm radius beampipe and a 3-layer silicon vertex detector were used for the first sample of 152 million BB pairs, while a 1.5 cm radius beampipe, a 4-layer silicon detector and a small-cell inner drift chamber were used to record the remaining 383 million BB pairs [8].",

We obtain 35\u00b116 signal events for these samples, which is consistent with the MC prediction (64 events) within two standard deviations. There is no discrepancy between data and fit results either in recoil mass or in the r distributions, as shown in Fig 2. We repeat the fit using the background r PDF determined from the data in the recoil mass sideband regions M recoil \u2208 (2.40, 2.85) and (3.20, 3.30) GeV/c 2 . The difference between the two fit results (2.6 %) is included in the systematic error from the r distribution. We also repeat the fit without using the r distribution, which yields a result that differs by 3.3 % from the nominal fit result. We assign a 4.2 % systematic uncertainty for the r distribution, which is the sum in quadrature of these two errors.",

In summary, a search for CP violation in \u03a5(4S) decays was performed. In a data sample of 535 million BB pairs obtained via decays of the \u03a5(4S) resonance, no significant signals were observed. We obtain an upper limit of 4 \u00d7 10 \u22127 at the 90 % confidence level for the branching fraction of the CP violating modes, \u03a5(4S) \u2192 B 0B0 \u2192 J/\u03c8K 0 S + (J/\u03c8, \u03b7 c )K 0 S .
