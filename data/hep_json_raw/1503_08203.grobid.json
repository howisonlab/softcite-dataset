            "text": "We report the observation of the X(3823) in the process e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 X(3823) \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b3\u03c7c1 with a statistical significance of 6.2\u03c3, in data samples at center-of-mass energies \u221a s =4.230, 4.260, 4.360, 4.420 and 4.600 GeV collected with the BESIII detector at the BEPCII electron positron collider. The measured mass of the X(3823) is (3821.7 \u00b1 1.3 \u00b1 0.7) MeV/c 2 , where the first error is statistical and the second systematic, and the width is less than 16 MeV at the 90% confidence level. The products of the Born cross sections for e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 X(3823) and the branching ratio B[X(3823) \u2192 \u03b3\u03c7c1,c2] are also measured. These measurements are in good agreement with the assignment of the X(3823) as the \u03c8(1 3 D2) charmonium state. Since its discovery, charmonium -meson particles which contain a charm and an anti-charm quark -has been an excellent tool for probing Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), the fundamental theory that describes the strong interactions between quarks and gluons, in the non-perturbative (low-energy, long-distance effects) regime, and remains of high interest both experimentally and theoretically. All of the charmonium states with masses that are below the open-charm threshold have been firmly established [1,2]; open-charm refers to mesons containing a charm quark (antiquark) and either an up or down antiquark (quark), such as D orD. However, the observation of the spectrum that are above the opencharm threshold remains unsettled. During the past decade, many new charmoniumlike states were discovered, such as the X(3872) [3], the Y (4260) [4,5] and the Z c (3900) [5][6][7]. These states provide strong evidence for the existence of exotic hadron states [8]. Although charged charmoniumlike states like the Z c (3900) provide convincing evidence for the existence of multi-quark states [9], it is more difficult to distinguish neutral candidate exotic states from conventional charmonium. Moreover, the study of transitions between charmonium(like) states, such as the Y (4260) \u2192 \u03b3X(3872) [10], is an important approach to probe their nature, and the connections between them. Thus, a more complete understanding of the charmonium(like) spectroscopy and their relations is necessary and timely.",

Until now there have been no definitive observations of its two D-wave spin-triplet partner states, i.e., the 1 3 D 2 and 1 3 D 3 . Phenomenological models predict that the 1 3 D 2 charmonium state has large decay widths to \u03b3\u03c7 c1 and \u03b3\u03c7 c2 [11]. In 1994, the E705 experiment reported a candi-date for the 1 3 D 2 state with a mass of 3836 \u00b1 13 MeV/c 2 and a statistical significance of 2.8\u03c3 [12]. Recently, the Belle Collaboration reported evidence for a narrow resonance X(3823) \u2192 \u03b3\u03c7 c1 in B meson decays with 3.8\u03c3 significance and mass 3823.1 \u00b1 1.8(stat) \u00b1 0.7(syst) MeV/c 2 , and suggested that this is a good candidate for the 1 3 D 2 charmonium state [13]. In the following, we denote the 1 3 D 2 state as \u03c8 2 and the \u03c8(3686) [\u03c8(2S)] state as \u03c8 \u2032 .",

The background is parameterized as a linear function, as indicated by the J/\u03c8 mass sideband data. The \u03c8 \u2032 signal is used to calibrate the absolute mass scale and the resolution difference between data and simulation, which is expected to be similar for the X(3823) and \u03c8 \u2032 . A simultaneous fit with a common X(3823) mass is applied to the data sets with independent signal yields at \u221a s = 4.230, 4.260, 4.360, 4.420 and 4.600 GeV (data sets with small luminosities are merged to nearby data sets with larger luminosities), for the \u03b3\u03c7 c1 and \u03b3\u03c7 c2 modes, respectively.

For the \u03b3\u03c7 c2 mode, we do not observe an X(3823) signal and provide an upper limit on its production rate (Table I). The limited statistics preclude a measurement of the intrinsic width of X(3823).

Since we use the \u03c8 \u2032 signal to calibrate the fit, we conservatively take the uncertainty of 0.6 MeV/c 2 in the calibration procedure as the systematic uncertainty due to the mass scale. The resolution difference between the data and MC simulation is also estimated by the \u03c8 \u2032 signal. Varying the resolution parameter by \u00b11\u03c3, the mass difference in the fit is 0.2 MeV/c 2 , which is taken as the systematic uncertainty from resolution.

Among these, the 1 1 D 2 \u2192 \u03b3\u03c7 c1 transition is forbidden due to C-parity conservation, and the amplitude for 1 3 D 3 \u2192 \u03b3\u03c7 c1 is expected to be small [28]. The mass of \u03c8(1 3 D 2 ) is in the 3.810 \u223c 3.840 GeV/c 2 range that is expected for several phenomenological calculations [29]. In this case, the mass of \u03c8(1 3 D 2 ) is above the DD threshold but below the DD * threshold. Since \u03c8(1 3 D 2 ) \u2192 DD violates parity, the \u03c8(1 3 D 2 ) is expected to be narrow, in agreement with our observation, and \u03c8(1 3 D 2 ) \u2192 \u03b3\u03c7 c1 is expected to be a dominant decay mode [29,30].

For the \u03b3\u03c7 c2 mode, we do not observe an X(3823) signal and provide an upper limit on its production rate(Table I). The limited statistics preclude a measurement of the intrinsic width of X(3823). From a fit using a Breit-Wigner function (with a width parameter that is allowed to float) convolved with Gaussian resolution, we determine \u0393[X(3823)] < 16 MeV at the 90% confidence level (C.L.)
