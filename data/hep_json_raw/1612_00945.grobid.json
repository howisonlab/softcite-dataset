The dataset consists of proton-proton interactions at centre-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 TeV, corresponding to integrated luminosities of 1 and 2 fb \u22121 , respectively. The analysis is performed assuming a set of production mechanisms with simple topologies, including the production of a Higgs-like particle decaying into two long-lived particles. The mass range from 20 to 80 GeV/c 2 and lifetimes from 5 to 100 ps are explored. Results are also interpreted in terms of neutralino production in different R-Parity violating supersymmetric models, with masses in the 23-198 GeV/c 2 range. No excess above the background expectation is observed and upper limits are set on the production cross-section for various points in the parameter space of theoretical models.",

The minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) is the simplest phenomenologically viable realization of SUSY [1,2]. The present study focuses on a subset of models featuring massive long-lived particles (LLP) with a measurable flight distance [3,4]. LLP searches have been performed by Tevatron and LHC experiments [5][6][7][8][9][10][11], often using the Hidden Valley framework [4] as a benchmark model (see also the study of Ref. [12]). The LHCb detector probes the forward rapidity region which is only partially covered by the other LHC experiments, and triggers on particles with low transverse momenta, which allows the experiment to explore relatively small LLP masses.",

The e-mail: aurelio.bay@epfl.ch event topology considered in this study is a displaced vertex with several tracks including a high p T muon. This topology is found in the context of the minimal super-gravity (mSUGRA) realisation of the MSSM, with R-parity violation [13], in which the neutralino can decay into a muon and two jets. Neutralinos can be produced by a variety of processes. In this paper four simple production mechanisms with representative topologies and kinematics are considered, with the assumed LLP mass in the range 20-80 GeV/c 2 . The LLP lifetime range considered is 5-100 ps, i.e. larger than the typical b-hadron lifetime. It corresponds to an average flight distance of up to 30 cm, well inside the LHCb vertex detector. One of the production mechanisms considered in detail is the decay into two LLPs of a Higgs-like particle with an assumed mass between 50 and 130 GeV/c 2 , i.e. in a range which includes the mass of the scalar boson discovered by the ATLAS and CMS experiments [14,15]. In addition, inclusive analyses are performed assuming the full set of neutralino production mechanisms available in Pythia 6 [16]. In this case the LLP mass explored is in the range  GeV/c 2 , inspired by Ref. [12], and different combinations of gluino and squark masses are studied.",

In Geant4, the detector and its response are implemented as described in Ref. [25]. In the fast simulation, which is used to cover a broader parameter space of the theoretical models, the charged particles falling into the geometrical acceptance of the detector are processed by the vertex reconstruction algorithm. The simulation accounts for the effects of the material veto described in the next section. The program also provides parameterised particle momenta resolutions, but it is found that these resolutions have no significant impact on the LLP mass reconstruction, nor on the signal detection efficiency. The fast simulation is validated by comparison with the full simulation. The distributions for mass, momentum and transverse momentum of the reconstructed LLP and for the reconstructed decay vertex position are in excellent agreement, as well as the muon momentum and its impact parameter to the PV. The detection efficiencies predicted by the full and the fast simulation differ by less than 5%.",

Other points in the parameter space of the theoretical models are studied with the fast simulation, covering the m LLP range  GeV/c 2 . These models are referred to as \"LV\" (for lepton number violation) followed by the LLP mass in GeV/c 2 and lifetime (e.g. LV98 10 ps). For the second scenario, the four production mechanisms depicted in Fig. 1, labelled PA, PB, PC, and PD, are selected and studied independently with the fast simulation. The LLP, represented by the neutralino, subsequently decays into two quarks and a muon. The processes PA, PC, and PD have two LLPs in the final state. In processes PC and PD two LLPs are produced by the decay of a Higgs-like particle of mass m h 0 , and by the decay of squarks of mass mq, respectively. In process PB a single LLP is produced recoiling against an object labelled as a \"gluino\", of mass m \"g\" . In order to control the kinematic conditions, the particles generated in these processes are constrained to be on-shell and the \"gluino\" of option PB is stable.

Several million simulated events are available with production of W and Z bosons. The most relevant background in this analysis is from bb events. The available simulated inclusive bb events are not numerous enough to cover the highp T muon kinematic region required in this analysis. To enhance the bb background statistics, a dedicated sample of 2.14 \u00d7 10 5 simulated events has been produced with a minimum partonp T of 20 GeV/c and requiring a muon with p T > 12 GeV/c in 1.5 < \u03b7 < 5.0. As a consequence of limitations in the available computing power, only bb events with \u221a s = 7 TeV have been fully simulated. Despite the considerable increase of generation efficiency, all the simulated bb events are rejected by the multivariate analysis presented in the next section. Therefore a data-driven approach is employed for the final background estimation.",

Genuine PVs are identified by a small radial distance from the beam axis, R xy < 0.3 mm. The offline analysis requires that the triggering muon has an impact parameter to all PVs of d IP > 0.25 mm and p T > 12 GeV/c. To suppress the background due to kaons or pions punching through the calorimeters and being misidentified as muons, the corresponding energy deposit in the calorimeters must be less than 4% of the muon energy. To preserve enough background events in the signal-free region for the signal determination algorithm described in Sect. 5, no isolation requirement is applied at this stage. Secondary vertices are selected by requiring R xy > 0.55 mm, at least four tracks in the forward direction (i.e. in the direction of the spectrometer) including the muon and no tracks in the backward direction. The total invariant mass of the tracks coming from a selected vertex must be larger than 4.5 GeV/c 2 . Particles interacting with the detector material are an important source of background. A geometric veto is used to reject events with vertices in regions occupied by detector material [27].",

Less than 1% of the events have more than one candidate vertex, in which case the candidate with the highestp T muon is chosen. According to the simulation, the background is largely dominated by bb events, while the contribution from the decays of W and Z bosons is of the order of 10 events. All simulated cc and tt events are rejected. The bb cross-section value measured by LHCb, 288 \u00b1 4 \u00b1 48 \u03bcb [28][29][30][31], predicts (15 \u00b1 3) \u00d7 10 3 events for the 7 TeV dataset, after selection. The value for the 8 TeV dataset is (52 \u00b1 10) \u00d7 10 3 . The extrapolation of the crosssection from 7 to 8 TeV is obtained from POWHEG [32-34], while Pythia is used to obtain the detection efficiency. The candidate yields for the two datasets are consistent with a dominant bb composition of the background. This is confirmed by the study of the shapes of the distributions of the relevant observables. Figure 2 compares the distributions for the 7 TeV dataset and for the 135 simulated bb events surviving the selection. For illustration, the shapes of simulated LV38 10 ps signal events are superimposed on all the distributions, as well as the expected shape for LV38 50 ps on the R xy distribution. The muon isolation variable is defined as the sum of the energy of tracks surrounding the muon direction, including the muon itself, in a cone of radius R \u03b7\u03c6 = 0.3 in the pseudorapidity-azimuthal angle (\u03b7, \u03c6) space, divided by the energy of the muon track. The corresponding distribution is shown in Fig. 2b. A muon isolation value of unity denotes a fully isolated muon. As expected, the muon from the signal is found to be more isolated than the hadronic background. Figure 2e presents the radial distribution of the displaced vertices; the drop in the number of candidates with a vertex above R xy \u223c 5 mm is due to the material veto. From simulation, the veto introduces a loss of efficiency of 13% (42%) for the detection of LLPs with a 30 GeV/c 2 mass and a 10 ps (100 ps) lifetime. The radial (\u03c3 R ) and longitudinal (\u03c3 z , parallel to the beam) uncertainties provided by the LLP vertex fit are shown in Fig. 2f, g. Larger uncertainties are expected from the vertex fits of candidates from bb events compared to signal LLPs. The former are more boosted and produce more narrowly collimated tracks, while the relatively heavier signal LLPs decay into more divergent tracks. This effect decreases when m LLP approaches the mass of b-quark hadrons.",

The muon isolation value and the reconstructed mass of the long-lived particles are not used in the MLP classifier; the discrimination power of these two variables is subsequently exploited for the signal determination. The signal training and test samples are obtained from simulated signal events selected under the same conditions as data.

For this, a number of candidates equal to the number of candidates of the signal training set, which is of the order of 1000, is randomly chosen in the data. The same procedure provides the background test samples. The MLP training is performed independently for each fully simulated model and dataset. The optimal MLP requirement is subsequently determined by maximizing a figure of merit defined The generalisation power of the MLP is assessed by verifying that the distributions of the classifier output for the training sample and the test sample agree.

The data candidates are separated into a signal region with muon isolation below 1.4 and a background region with isolation value from 1.4 to 2. The signal region contains more than 90% of the signal for all the models considered (see e.g. Fig. 2b). The reconstructed mass obtained from the background candidates is used to constrain an empirical probability density function (PDF) consisting of the sum of two negative slope exponential functions, for which the slope values and amplitudes are free parameters in the fit. The signal PDF is taken from the histogram of the mass distribution obtained from simulation. The fit is performed simultaneously on events from the background region and from the signal region. In the latter the numbers of signal and background events are left free in the fit, while the slope values and the relative strength of the two exponential functions are in common with the background region fit.

The efficiencies for the models where the fast simulation is used, including processes PA, PB, PC, and PD, vary from about 0.1% to about 2%. The efficiency increases with m LLP because more particles are produced in the decay of heavier LLPs. This effect is only partially counteracted by the loss of particles outside the spectrometer acceptance, which is especially likely when the LLP are produced from the decay of heavier states, such as the Higgs-like particles of process PC. Another competing phenomenon is that the lower boost of heavier LLPs results in a shorter average flight length, i.e. the requirement of a minimum R xy disfavours heavy LLPs. The cut on R xy is more efficient at selecting LLPs with large lifetimes, but for lifetimes larger than \u223c50 ps a consider-able portion of the decays falls into the material region and is vetoed.

The detection efficiency is affected by the parton luminosity model and depends upon the production process, with a maximum uncertainty of 7% for the gluon-gluon fusion process PC. For the fast simulation based analysis there is an additional contribution of 5%. The systematic effects associated with the signal and background models used in the LLP mass fit are not shown in the close to the muon p T threshold. By changing the minimum d IP requirement by this amount, the change in the detection efficiency is in the range 0.4-1.2%, depending on the model. The vertex reconstruction efficiency is affected by the tracking efficiency and has a complicated spatial structure due to the geometry of the VELO and the material veto. In the material-free region, R xy < 4.5 mm, the efficiency to detect secondary vertices as a function of the flight distance has been studied in detail, in particular in the context of the b hadrons lifetime measurement [44]. The deviation of the efficiency in simulation with respect to the data is below 1%. For R xy from 4.5 mm to about 12 mm a study performed with inclusive bb events finds differences between data and simulation of less than 5%. The corresponding systematic uncertainties are determined by altering the efficiency in the simulation program as a function of the true vertex position. A maximum of 1% uncertainty is obtained for all the signal models. An alternative procedure to asses this uncertainty considers vertices from B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8 K * 0 decays with J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 and K * 0 \u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212 . The detection efficiency in data and simulation is found to agree within 10%. This result, obtained from a four-particle final state, when propagated to LLP decays with on average more than 10 charged final-state particles for all modes, results in a discrepancy of at most 2% between the LLP efficiencies in data and simulation, which is the adopted value for the respective systematic uncertainty.",

The uncertainty due to the signal model accounts for the mass scale, the mass resolution and the finite number of events available to construct the model. Pseudoexperiments in which 10 signal events are added to the data are analysed with a modified signal template, and the resulting number of fitted candidates is compared to the result from the nominal fit model. Assuming as before a 10% uncertainty on the signal mass scale, a maximum absolute variation of 0.6 fitted signal candidates is obtained. No significant effects are obtained by modify-ing the signal mass resolution with an additional smearing. Changing the statistical precision by reducing the initial number N of signal events used to build the histogram PDF by 2 \u221a N has no significant effect either. The uncertainty induced by the choice of the background model is obtained by reweighting the candidates from the background region in such a way that the distribution of the number of tracks included in the LLP vertex fit exactly matches the distribution in the signal region. This test is motivated by the fact that the number of tracks has a significant correlation with the measured mass. The fits of the mass distribution of pseudoexperiments give absolute variations in the numbers of fitted signal events in the range 0.1-1.6, the largest value at low LLP mass. Reweighting the candidates in such a way as to match the p T distributions gives variations which are less than 0.5 events for all models. Moving the isolation threshold by \u00b10.1 leads to variations of the order of 0.01 events. In conclusion, the variation on the number of fitted candidates associated to the choice of the PDF models is in the range of 1-2 events. The calculation of the crosssection upper limits takes into account this uncertainty as an additional nuisance parameter on the fit procedure.",
