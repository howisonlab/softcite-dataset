For such values of E beam the quantity of Q 2 min (COM P ASS) must be smaller by 22.5 times than Q 2 min (Serpukhov). In this experiment [6] the authors considered Q 2 cut 0.0015 (GeV/c) 2 . As shown in [26] the basic ratio R \u03c0 is applicable for the Coulomb peak only. In Ref. [27] it is elaborated that the Coulomb amplitude interference with the coherent nuclear amplitude is important for 0.0005 Q 0.0015 (GeV/c) 2 . This means that the Serpukhov analysis could safely apply the ratio R \u03c0 in (6), whereas COM-PASS has to consider the interference of the Coulomb and strong amplitude. The phase determined with the simple considerations in Ref. [28] for the Serpukhov experiment [5] is close to \u03c0/2 meaning that the subtraction of a nuclear background assumed to be incoherent is justified. In the COMPASS analysis a Gaussian profile function is used for the diffractive background and the relative phase is determined by a fit to the cross sections. The contributions to the fit are not shown in Fig. 3(c) of Ref. [6]. With a more realistic \"absorbing disc\" for the profile function [29] all bumps in Fig. 3(c) are well reproduced and again a phase is close to \u03c0/2 is indicated [30]. Without a real fit to the data it is impossible to estimate the effect of the model dependence of the diffractive background, but that it will have an influence is clear from Ref. [27]. Considering this situation the discussion of the central subtraction of the diffractive background is insufficient to get a feeling for model dependence of the analysis.",

            "text": "Authors of most dispersion approaches used DRs for partial waves taking into account the contribution of S and D wave only. Moreover, they often used additional assumptions, for example, to determine subtraction constants. The dipole polarizabilities of charged pions were obtained in works [7,11,12,19,34,35] from the analysis of the experimental data in the region of the low energy (W < 700 MeV) mainly (where W is the total energy in \u03b3\u03b3 c.m. system). The most of results for the charged pion polarizabilities obtained in these works are close to the ChPT prediction [22,23]. On the other hand, the values of the experimental cross section of the process \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 in this region are very ambiguous. Therefore, as it has been shown in Ref. [11,13], even changes of these values by more than 100% are still compatible with the present error bars in the energy region considered. Therefore at present, more realistic values of the polarizabilities could be obtained analyzing the experimental data on \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 in a wider energy region.",
