Observed for the first time in 1995 at the Tevatron collider by the CDF and D0 experiments [1,2], it has a mass of 173.2 \u00b1 1.0 GeV [3], about 40 times heavier than its partner, the bottom (or beauty, b) quark and more than twice heavier than the W boson. It decays almost exclusively to a W boson and a bottom quark with an expected lifetime of about 10 \u221225 s. The lifetime is too short to allow the formation of bound states with other quarks, such as hadrons, and the top quark properties at production time are directly transferred to the its decay products.",

            "text": "The top quark can be produced at two hadron colliders: the Tevatron at Fermilab, colliding protons with antiprotons at center-of-mass energies up to At hadron colliders the top quark can be produced in pairs through strong interactions, or singly via weak interactions. At the Tevatron with \u221a s = 1.96 TeV, about 85% of the total production rate is expected to be from the annihilation of the valence quarks and antiquarks, while the remaining 15% is from gluon-gluon fusion. The expected cross section for pair production computed at next-to-leading order accuracy (NLO) of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) is \u03c3 tt = 6.74 +0.52 \u22120.80 pb for a top mass m t = 173 GeV [4]. Production of single top or antitop quarks proceeds through the exchange of a W boson in the s-or t-channel, or in the W t associated production channel. At the Tevatron the production cross section for single top (or antitop) is 3.4 \u00b1 0.2 pb. At the LHC top pair production is largely dominated by gluon-gluon fusion (80% at \u221a s = 7 TeV) while the rest is from qq annihilation. The cross section for pair production is more than 20 times larger than the corresponding Tevatron value, \u03c3 tt = 160 +22 \u221223 pb at \u221a s = 7 TeV [5], making the LHC a real top factory. The single top cross section is about 40% of the pair production at \u221a s = 7 TeV and is not equal for quarks and antiquarks due to the proton parton density functions. The single top cross section is about a factor 2 larger than the corresponding antitop cross sections in the t-and s-channels, while the W t cross section is the same for t andt.",

It determines the Yukawa coupling of the quark to the Higgs boson and contributes to several electroweak precision observables via radiative corrections. Precise measurements of the top quark and W boson masses can constrain the Higgs boson mass and represent an important internal consistency test of the SM. The ATLAS and CMS experiments have recently announced the observation of a new boson with mass of about 125-126 GeV [10,11]. Further studies and larger datasets are required to fully establish the nature of the new particle. If confirmed as the Higgs boson of the SM, the precise determination of its mass and of the top quark mass, along with the strong coupling constant, will constraint the extrapolation of electroweak vacuum stability up to the Planck scale [13]. The main methodology used to determine the top quark mass at hadron colliders consists in measuring the invariant mass of the decay products of the top event candidates and deducing the mass, m top , using sophisticated analysis methods. The most precise measurements of this type use the tt \u2192 lepton + jets channel, where one of the W bosons from the tt final state decays into a charged lepton and a neutrino and the other into a pair of quarks. The CMS and ATLAS collaborations have recently performed measurements using this decay channel as well as dileptonic final states, where both W bosons decay leptonically.",

The combination of all four measurements of m top yields statistical and systematic uncertainties on the top quark mass of 0.6 GeV and 2.3 GeV, respectively. Presently this combination does not improve the precision of the measured top quark mass from the 2d-analysis, which has the better expected total uncertainty. Therefore, the result from the 2d-analysis is presented as the final result. The two analyses will differently profit from progress on the individual systematic uncertainties, which can be fully exploited by the method to estimate the statistical correlation of different estimators of m top obtained in the same data sample together with the outlined combination procedure. The results m top values. The resulting m top distributions are used to c signal template. We find an average bias on m top of 0.04 \u00b1 0 our final value. Figure 3 shows the linearity (top plot) an the fit, after applying the calibration corrections. We assig (0.40 GeV/c 2 ) as systematic uncertainty associated to the fit  The possible decay channels of tt pairs include the case in which both W bosons decay to quark-antiquark pairs. This mode yields a six quark final state, two of which are b quarks from the top-quark decays. Additional quarks or gluons may be created by initial or final state radiation from the interacting partons. Measurements using fully hadronic final states were recently reported by the ATLAS and CDF collaborations. The ATLAS analysis, based on 2 fb \u22121 , selects events with five jets of p T > 55 GeV and a sixth jet of p T > 30 GeV [16]. To suppress backgrounds from multijet events and collinear b-quark pair production from gluon splitting two of the reconstructed jets with |\u03b7| < 2.5 are required to be b-tagged and separated by a three-dimensional angular aperture \u2206R > 1.2. The top quark mass, reported in Table I, is obtained by fitting templates to the three-jet mass combination of the selected jet triplets. The templates are obtained by combining simulated signal samples for five top masses in the range 160-190 GeV with a background contribution obtained from data by mixing jets from different events. The dominant systematic uncertainties on the top mass are the inclusive and b-jet JES, the background modelling and the contribution of initial-or final-state radiation. The CDF analysis in hadronic top decays is based on 5.8 fb \u22121 [17]. Events with six to eight jets with E T > 15 GeV and minimum angular distance \u2206R > 0.5 are processed with a neural network (NN) using 13 input kinematic variables. Events are further selected requiring the NN output above a given threshold and one to three b-tagged jets. The top mass (see Table I) and JES are simultaneously extracted from a 2-D template method, using templates with top quark masses between 160 and 185 GeV. The most relevant sources of systematic uncertainties on the mass measurement are the background modelling, Monte Carlo modelling of the hard interaction and residual JES uncertainties.",

Due to CPT conservation the mass of a quark must be equal to that of its antiparticle. The top quark is the only case in which a free quark can be observed, for it decays before hadronizing, constituting an excellent test bench for CPT conservation. The mass difference between the top and its antiquark, \u2206m t = m t \u2212 mt, was measured by the D0 and CDF experiments, showing no significant deviation from zero [19]. The values measured by CDF and D0 are \u2206m t = \u22123.3 \u00b1 1.7 GeV and 0.84 \u00b1 1.87 GeV, respectively. The CMS experiment has recently measured the mass difference with unprecedented precision [20]. The analysis, based on an integrated luminosity of about 5 fb \u22121 , selects events with one W boson candidate decaying into quark-antiquark pairs and the other decaying leptonically, where the lepton is a muon or a neutrino. The data sample is divided into negative and positive lepton charges. For each category, the ideogram method is used to measure the mass of the top or anti top quark and the difference between the masses in the two categories of lepton charge is taken as the mass difference. The measured mass difference is \u2206m t = \u22120.44 \u00b1 0.46(stat.) \u00b1 0.46(syst.) GeV. The largest systematic uncertainties are currently given by the pile-up effects, the method calibration and the response difference for b anti-b jets. The measurement is in agreement with the the assumption of CPT invariance and is more precise by at least a factor three than any of the previous measurements.",

The helicity is measured through the study of angular distributions of top decay products in different decay channels. The helicity angle \u03b8 * is defined as the angle between the charged lepton momentum in the W rest frame and the W momentum in the top rest frame. The CDF and D0 experiments have performed measurements of of F 0 and F R in the lepton+jets and dilepton channels. The measurements are of two types: (i) a model-independent approach (also called \"2D\") where F 0 and F R are determined simultaneously and (ii) a model-dependent approach here F 0 (F R ) is fixed to its SM value and F R (F 0 ) is measured (called \"1D\"). In both cases the fractions are assumed to satisfy the condition F R + R 0 + F L = 1. The single measurements from both approaches have been recently combined using the BLUE method [22]. The values obtained from the combination procedure are summarized in Table II. The CMS experiment has measured the W helicity fractions using a dataset corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.2 fb \u22121 [23]. Events are selected with one W candidate decaying hadronically and the other W decaying leptonically, into a muon and a neutrino. Muons with p T > 25 GeV and at least four jets with p T > 30 GeV are requested. The W+jets background is suppressed by requiring at least one of the jets to be b-tagged. The tt event is reconstructed via a constrained kinematic fit. Only events with at least four jets and one lepton are used, with constrains optimised to improve the cos(\u03b8 * ) resolution. Two types of fits are performed: (i) a \"3D fit\" where the fractions F 0 , F L and the tt component normalisation, F tt , are treated as free parameters and F R = 1 \u2212 F 0 \u2212 F L , and (ii) a \"2D fit\" leaving F 0 and F tt as free parameters and setting F R = 0, F L = 1 \u2212 F 0 . The results of the two methods are reported in Table II. The measurement of W helicity fraction was performed also by the ATLAS experiment, with a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1.04 fb \u22121 [24]. Events with at least one isolated lepton (electron or muon) are selected with E T > 25 GeV (p T > 20 GeV) for electrons (muons). In the single lepton channels four jets are requested with at least one of them being tagged as b-jet. In the dilepton channels (ee, e\u00b5 and \u00b5\u00b5) at least two jets are required, with at least one of them being b-tagged. The helicity fractions were extracted with two methods using events reconstructed with a kinematic kit: a fit of the cos(\u03b8 * ) distribution using different W helicity Presented at Flavor Physics and CP Violation (FPCP 2012), Hefei, China, May [21][22][23][24][25]2012 templates from simulation, and from a measurement of the angular asymmetries using an unfolded cos(\u03b8 * ) spectrum corrected for background contributions. The single results were combined using the BLUE method, taking into account the statistical correlations between analyses and the correlations of systematic uncertainties (see Table II). All experimental results are in agreement with NNLO QCD predictions with the ATLAS result being the most precise estimate from a single experiment.",

At hadron colliders top quark pairs are expected to be produced with spins significantly correlated. The observation of spin decorrelation could indicate that the spin orientation was modified by a non-SM decay process, such as a top decaying into a scalar charged Higgs boson and a b-quark (t \u2192 H + b). Measurements of spin correlations were first performed by the CDF and D0 experiments, however none of these measurements had sufficient sensitivity to discriminate between the SM and the uncorrelated spins hypothesis. More recently, the D0 experiment has performed a measurement based on an integrated luminosity of 5.3 fb \u22121 , providing the first evidence of spin correlations in tt events with a significance exceeding three standard deviations [26]. The degree of correlation, A, can be defined as the fractional difference between the number of events where the top and anti top quark spin orientations are aligned and those where the top quark spins have opposite alignment. The value A = +1 (\u22121) corresponds to fully parallel (antiparallel) spins. Next-to-leading-order (NLO) QCD predicts A = 0.78 +0.03 \u22120.04 for pp collisions at \u221a s = 1.96 TeV [27]. The D0 measurement is based on a matrix-element approach using lepton+jets events and has been combined with the measurement in the dilepton channel. One isolated electron or muon with p T > 20 GeV and four jets with p T > 20 GeV are requested, where the leading jet has p T > 40 GeV. The ratio of events with correlated spins to the total number of events, f meas , is extracted from a binned maximum-likelihood fit to the discriminant distribution using simulated templates of tt with and without spin correlations. The combination of the two channels yields f meas = 0.85 \u00b1 0.2(stat. + syst.), which excludes the region f < 0.344 at 95% CL.",

The e + e \u2212 , \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 and e \u00b1 \u00b5 \u2213 channels are fitted simultaneously with a common value of f SM , a tt normalization that is allowed to vary (per channel) and a fixed background normalization. The fitted tt normalizations are in agreement with the theoretical prediction of the production cross section [42]. Negative values of f SM correspond to an anti-correlation of the top and antitop quark spins. A value of f SM = 0 implies that the spins are uncorrelated and values of f SM > 1 indicate a larger strength of the tt spin correlation than predicted by the SM. The extraction of f SM using the fitting procedure has been verified over a wide range of possible values, \u22121 \u2264 f SM \u2264 2, using MC simulation pseudo-experiments with full detector simulation.

The in agreement with the SM predictions. Further studies of tt spin correlations were recently reported by the ATLAS and CMS experiments. At the LHC top pair production occurs mostly through the gluon-gluon channel. At low invariant masses, m tt \u2264 400 GeV, the production process is dominated by fusion of gluon pairs of equal helicity, resulting in tt pairs with aligned orientations of the top and anti-top spins (left-left or right-right) [28]. When both W bosons from the top pair decay leptonically they produce charged leptons with correlated azimuthal angle in the laboratory frame, a quantity well measured by LHC detectors. The ATLAS measurement, based on an integrated luminosity of 2.1 fb \u22121 , selects events with exactly two oppositely charged lepton candidates (ee, \u00b5\u00b5, e\u00b5) [29]. The electron (muon) candidates are selected with p T > 25(20) GeV and dilepton invariant mass above 15 GeV [28]. An additional cut on the missing transverse energy is imposed on events with lepton pairs of the same flavor to suppress background from Z+jets and W+jets events. The spin correlation is extracted from a binned log-likelihood fit of the dilepton azimuthal angle difference, \u2206\u03c6. The signal template is constituted by a linear superimposition of the SM tt simulation with coefficient f SM , and from the uncorrelated tt simulation with coefficient (1 \u2212 f SM ). Thus, f SM = 0 corresponds to uncorrelated spins.",

            "text": "Presented at Flavor Physics and CP Violation (FPCP 2012), Hefei, China, May 21-25, 2012 Figure 4 shows the reconstructed \u2206\u03c6 distribution compared with the SM expectation and uncorrelated tt simulation. The measured value from the fit is f SM = 1.30 \u00b1 0.14(stat.) +0.27 \u22120.22 (syst.), where the largest systematic uncertainties are associated to the JES, jet resolution and efficiency, and fake leptons. The measurement can be translated into a determination of the correlation degree, A, by multiplying for a factor obtained from NLO QCD and dependent on the spin basis. The result in the helicity basis is reported in Table III together with the SM prediction at NLO accuracy. A similar analysis was recently performed by the CMS experiment, based on an integrated luminosity of 5 fb \u22121 [31]. Candidate events are selected with two isolated charged leptons (electrons or muons) with p T > 20 GeV and two or more jets, where at least one is identified as originating from a b-quark. The events are also required to have a dilepton invariant mass above 20 GeV for the three channels and a missing transverse energy above 40 GeV for the ee and \u00b5\u00b5 channels only. A binned likelihood fit of the reconstructed \u2206\u03c6 distribution is used to extract the spin correlation coefficient. All the events are fitted together in a single fit, but different templates are used according to the decay channel. The background-subtracted and unfolded differential cross-section as function of \u2206\u03c6 is shown in Figure 4. The result in the helicity basis is in good agreement with the SM expectation and is reported in Table III. The largest systematic uncertainties are associated to the background normalisation and MC statistics. The CMS experiment also investigated the spin correlations through asymmetry distributions, inclusively and at high m tt at reconstruction level, and inclusively unfolded to parton level. These results are also in agreement with the SM predictions.",

At NLO the interference between the Born diagram and the box diagram, as well as between initial-and final-state gluon emission, correlates the flight directions of the top quarks and antiquarks to the directions of motion of the initial quarks and antiquarks, respectively. The tt production in gluon-gluon fusion is however, charge symmetric. At Tevatron top pairs are predominantly produced by quark-antiquark annihilation, therefore top quarks are emitted preferentially along the direction of motion of the incoming protons and the top antiquarks along the direction of the antiprotons. This leads to a small forward-backward asymmetry of (6 \u00b1 1)% in the tt rest frame [32][33][34]. The signed difference between the rapidities of the top and anti-top, \u2206y = y t \u2212 yt, reflects the asymmetry in tt production and one can define the integrated charge asymmetry as",

Combining the two CDF results yields A fb = (20.1 \u00b1 6.7)% [37]. A measurement performed by the D0 experiment in the lepton+jets channel and based on an integrated luminosity of 5.4 fb \u22121 gives A fb = (19.6 \u00b1 6.5)%, in good agreement with CDF [39]. More recently, CDF performed a new measurement based on 8.7 fb \u22121 [38]. The measured inclusive asymmetry is [16.2 \u00b1 4.1(stat.) \u00b1 2.2(syst.)]% while the NLO QCD prediction from POWHEG Monte Carlo is A = 6.6%. CDF has also measured the asymmetry differentially as function of the rapidity difference \u2206y and top anti-top invariant mass, m tt . In both cases, the asymmetry dependence Presented at Flavor Physics and CP Violation (FPCP 2012), Hefei, China, May [21][22][23][24][25]2012 on the measured variable is consistent with a linear increase, but the measured slopes are about 2.4\u03c3 larger than the NLO QCD predictions.",

In the latter case, tt production via qq or qg scattering is expected to be small, and the dominant process is gg \u2192 tt. The symmetric initial state does not generate forward-backward asymmetries and A fb is not a useful observable any longer. However, the rapidity distribution of top and anti-top pairs differs, with top quarks emitted more frequently towards larger rapidities. The effect is due to the different momenta of the incoming qq partons as the valence quarks carry, on average, a larger fraction of the proton momentum than the anti-quark from the proton sea. The anti-top quark distribution is, therefore, more peaked towards central rapidity values. The charge asymmetry can be measured from the difference of the absolute values of pseudorapidities (or rapidities), \u2206|\u03b7| = |\u03b7 t | \u2212 |\u03b7t|.

[44] Measurements of A C have been performed by both ATLAS and CMS experiments using lepton+jets and dilepton decays. In the ATLAS measurement [41], based on about 1 fb \u22121 , events are selected with a single isolated electron (muon) with p T > 25 (20) GeV, at least four jets with p T > 25 GeV and missing transverse energy E miss T > 20 GeV. In the 'tagged' selection at least one of the jets is required to be b-tagged. After background subtraction, a Bayesian unfolding procedure is performed to correct for acceptance and detector effects. The result is in agreement with the SM expectation and is reported in Table IV. The largest systematic uncertainties are associated to the modeling of the tt signal and gluon radiation as well as the multi-jet background for the electron channel. More recently ATLAS has reported a measurement in the dilepton channel based on 4.7 fb \u22121 [42]. Events are selected with two oppositely-charged isolated muons (electrons) with p T > 20 (25) GeV, a missing transverse energy E miss T > 60 GeV and two jets with p T > 25 GeV. Lepton pairs of different flavor are also included. A method based on leadingorder matrix elements is adopted to fully reconstruct the tt four momenta, by fixing the top quark and W boson masses to the world average values. The asymmetry in each channel is measured after background subtraction and after correction for acceptance and detector effects. The combination of the three channels (ee, \u00b5\u00b5 and e\u00b5) based on the BLUE method is reported in Table IV and is found to be consistent with the SM expectation. The dominant systematic uncertainties on the single measurements are the multi-jet background modeling as well as the electron efficiency and resolution. The ATLAS experiment has also measured a lepton-based asymmetry, A ll C , that does not require the reconstruction of the full tt system. In this case, the measured discriminating variable is \u2206|\u03b7| = |\u03b7 l + | \u2212 \u03b7| l \u2212 |, representing the difference of the absolute values of positively and negatively charged lepton pseudorapidities. The result is A ll C = [2.3 \u00b1 1.2(stat.) \u00b1 0.8(syst.)]%, in good agreement with the MC@NLO Monte Carlo prediction of (0.4 \u00b1 0.1)%.",

The result has been recently updated with 4.7 fb \u22121 [44]. Events are Presented at Flavor Physics and CP Violation (FPCP 2012), Hefei, China, May [21][22][23][24][25]2012 selected with an isolated electron or muon with p T > 25 GeV and 17 GeV, respectively, together with at least three jets, each with p T > 30 GeV. The reconstructed top quark and antiquark four-vectors are used to obtain the inclusive and differential distributions of \u2206|y| as function of the rapidity, transverse momentum and invariant mass of the tt system. The corresponding asymmetry A C is also measured differentially from Eq. 3. The inclusive measurement is reported in Table IV where the dominant systematic uncertainties are associated to the unfolding technique and to the lepton identification and efficiency. Both the inclusive and differential distributions are consistent with the SM predictions and no hints for contributions from physics beyond the SM are found.  The forward-backward asymmetries measured at the Tevatron and the charge asymmetries from the LHC have been compared to the predictions of a number of simple models beyond the SM [41], as shown in Figure 5. The colored areas represent the ranges of predicted values for A F B and A C for the new physics models, computed using the tree-level SM amplitude and adding the contributions of new particles. The colored box is the SM prediction. The horizontal bands correspond to the ATLAS and CMS measurements from Refs. [41] and [43], respectively, while the vertical bands represent the Tevatron measurements from Refs. [35,39]. The LHC charge asymmetry measurements disfavor models with a new flavor-changing Z boson and are in tension with models introducing a W boson with right-handed couplings, while for the other new physics models the asymmetries measured at the Tevatron are consistent with the LHC within experimental uncertainties. The same study performed in the region of high invariant mass m tt > 450 GeV shows that the predictions of the six new physics models are in tension with the CDF and ATLAS high-mass measurements considered together.",

In the SM this decay occurs at one loop level but is strongly suppressed by the GIM mechanism. The SM expectation for the branching ratio is Br(t \u2192 Zc) 1 \u00d7 10 \u221214 , while the decay t \u2192 Zu is further suppressed by a factor |V ub /V cb | 2 7.9 \u00d7 10 \u22123 , yielding Br(t \u2192 Zu) 8 \u00d7 10 \u221217 .

The ATLAS measurement, based on 2.1 fb \u22121 , searches for events with one top (or antitop) decaying through the t \u2192 W b channel while the other decays in the suppressed Zq mode [48]. Only leptonic decays of the Z and W bosons are considered (Z \u2192 ee, \u00b5\u00b5, \u03c4 \u03c4 and W \u2192 e\u03bd, \u00b5\u03bd, \u03c4 \u03bd), leading to a final state with three isolated leptons, at least two jets and missing transverse energy from the semi-leptonic W boson decay. The events are divided into two categories: (i) a sample with three leptons identified from the combination of inner detector, calorimeter and muon spectrometer, and (ii) a sample in which one of the leptons is based on the inner detector information only while the other two lepton candidates are as in (i). In the former case the leading lepton is required to have p T > 20 GeV, and the two sub-leading leptons are required to have p T > 20 GeV. Furthermore, two jets with p T > 25 GeV are required and in the sample (ii) at least one of the two jets is required to be b-tagged. Finally, the missing transverse energy is required to be E miss T > 20 GeV. The selected event samples are required to be kinematically consistent with the tt \u2192 W bZq decay through a \u03c7 2 minimisation technique and further cuts are imposed on the reconstructed W and Z boson candidates masses. The number of events after all selection cuts is consistent with the background from SM processes and fake leptons and no evidence of the Zq decay is found. The expected and observed upper limits extracted with the CL s method are reported in Table V. The CMS measurement is based on an integrated luminosity of 4.6 fb \u22121 [49]. Similarly to the ATLAS case, the search is performed by selecting a sample of tt \u2192 W bZq candidate decays, where the W and Z bosons decay to electrons or muons. All three leptons in the final state are required to be isolated and have p T > 20 GeV. The invariant mass of and ee or \u00b5\u00b5 pair is required to be consistent with the Z boson mass. At least two jets with p T > 30 GeV are requested, separated by \u2206R > 0.4 from the lepton candidates. The resulting sample is then divided into two categories: (i) a sample requiring a minimum value of the variable HT s , defined as the scalar sum of the lepton transverse momenta, jet transverse energies and missing transverse energy, and (ii) requiring one of the two jets to be b-tagged. The latter selection is the most sensitive and hence taken as reference result. The number of observed events after all selection cuts is consistent with the expectation from SM background processes and no evidence of the Zq decay is found also in this case. The expected and observed upper limits computed with the CL s technique are given in Table V and represent the most stringent bound from a single experiment to date. Furthermore, this result improves on the Tevatron upper limits by approximately an order of magnitude.",

The top quark mass, a fundamental free parameter in the SM, has been determined with sub-percent precision and is the best known quark mass to date. The most precise single determinations have systematic uncertainties of about 1 GeV and statistical uncertainties below 1 GeV. Thus, improved analysis techniques will be required to further reduce the systematic uncertainties.

If the new boson recently observed by LHC experiments [10,11] is confirmed as the Higgs boson of the SM, precise measurements of its mass, along with the W boson and top quark masses, will provide stringent consistency tests for the SM and a better understanding of the electroweak vacuum stability at large energy scales.",
