We measure a branching fraction B(B 0 s \u2192 K 0 K 0 ) = [19.6 +5.8 \u22125.1 (stat.) \u00b1 1.0(sys.) \u00b1 2.0(N B 0 s B 0 s )] \u00d7 10 \u22126 with a significance of 5.1 standard deviations.

In con-trast, the neutral-daughter decays B 0 s \u2192 h 0 h 0 have yet to be observed. The decay B 0 s \u2192 K 0 K 0 [2] is of particular interest because the branching fraction is predicted to be relatively large. In the Standard Model (SM), the decay proceeds mainly via a b \u2192 s loop (or \"penguin\") transition as shown in Fig. 1, and the branching fraction is predicted to be in the range (16 \u2212 27) \u00d7 10 \u22126 [3]. The presence of non-SM particles or couplings could enhance this value [4]. It has been pointed out that CP asymmetries in B 0 s \u2192 K 0 K 0 decays are promising observables in which to search for new physics [5].",

These detector components are located inside a superconducting solenoid coil that provides a 1.5 T magnetic field. An iron flux-return located outside the coil (KLM) is instrumented to detect K 0 L mesons and to identify muons. The detector is described in detail elsewhere [9,10].

The +z axis is aligned with the direction opposite the e + beam and is parallel to the direction of the magnetic field within the solenoid.
