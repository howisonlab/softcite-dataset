At present, searches for muon decays beyond the Standard Model are performed by exploiting intense beams of muons, and plans exist to upgrade the present facilities or build new ones, which would open new prospects for the quest of new physics in this sector. In this paper I review the present status of the search for muon decays beyond the Standard Model, with a special attention to the most conventional muon lepton flavor violation experiments, but also considering more exotic scenarios and future outlooks.",

            "text": "Since the discovery of the muon in the cosmic ray radiation [1], the study of the properties and decays of this particle contributed to build and test the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics. Although this particle was initially identified as the mesotron proposed by Yukawa [2] in its theory of strong interactions, this interpretation was discarded by the experiments conducted by Conversi, Pancini and Piccioni in the years 1940s [3,4], which marked the birth of particle physics both from an experimental and theoretical point of view. Soon after, Hincks and Pontecorvo [5] started to look for the \u00b5 + \u2192 e + \u03b3 decay, and the missing observation of photons among the muon decay products demonstrated that it could not be considered just as an excited state of the electron. In the years 1950s the search for \u00b5 + \u2192 e + \u03b3 by Lokanathan and Steinberger [6] and the exclusion of a branching ratio (BR) around 10 \u22125 gave one of the first hints of the existence and conservation of lepton flavors, confirmed a few years later by the discovery of the muon neutrino in the Nobel-awarded experiment by Lederman, Schwartz and Steinberger himself [7]. Since then, studies of the muon decays have been carried on, till very recently [8], to test the structure of weak interaction.",

Nonetheless, the model looks incomplete from the theoretical point of view, due to some relevant limitations. Among them, a missing explanation for some of the most striking features of the model (namely, the hierarchical structure of the particle mass spectra) and the indication of a new mass scale around the TeV, that should prevent the mass of the Higgs boson to be pushed by radiative corrections to values much higher than the measured one. Many New Physics (NP) models have been built to overcome these difficulties and experiments are carried on to test these hypothetical scenarios.",

Some more exotic scenarios with new particles produced in muon decays are also discussed in Sec. 6. As already mentioned, the muon was discovered and firstly studied in the cosmic ray radiation. A significative step forward in the study of its properties and decay modes was performed when pion beam became available in the years 1950s.

Pions decaying in the target itself produce muons that can be collected and transported by a beam line toward the experimental areas where the detectors are installed. The most intense continuous muon beams in the world [10,11] are currently delivered at the Paul Scherrer Institut (PSI), in Villigen (CH). A 2 mA current of protons of 590 MeV kinetic energy from the PSI Ring Cyclotron hits two different graphite targets where, in total, \u223c 18% of the protons are stopped, the rest being preserved to serve a downstream neutron spallation source. The two targets serve different beam lines. In order to get an intense, pure and monoenergetic muon beam, particles with momentum p \u223c 28 MeV/c are selected, corresponding to muons emitted by pions decaying at rest. It happens when the pion decays right on the surface of the production target (surface muons). The beam can be further purified by selecting particles with a given velocity (and hence a given mass) by means of a Wien filter, a superposition of orthogonal electric (E) and magnetic (B) fields through which only particles with the desired velocity v = E/B go straight, while others are removed by collimators. Beams with up to a few 10 8 surface muons per second can be currently delivered at PSI.",

For instance, the Delivery Ring at Fermilab (Batavia, USA) used for the Mu2e experiment [12] provides protons in bunches separated in time by 1695 ns. They hit a target and produce muons that mostly arrive to the experimental apparatus within a few hundred ns. After about 700 ns and before the next bunch, only the muon decay products are practically visible in the detectors, with a very low contamination from other particles (and specifically pions) emerging from the production target.",

Hence, the only particles that can be reasonably detected in experiments to study the muon decays with high statistics are electrons and photons. Most often the muons are stopped in a thin target in order to exploit the advantages of the decay-at-rest kinematics.

The low material budget is necessary to reduce the multiple Coulomb scattering experienced by the electrons, which is very relevant at such low momenta and tends to spoil the original kinematics. For this reason, gaseous detectors like multi-wire proportional chambers (MWPC) or drift chambers [13] have been mostly used in the last decades. In the MEG experiment [14] the use of drift chambers with a very light structure allowed to keep the total number of radiation lengths along the whole positron trajectory below 2 \u00d7 10 \u22123 , i.e. less than one single layer of conventional silicon detectors. More recently, the development of very thin solid state detectors [15] added a new interesting option for tracking at very low momentum.

The \u00b5 + \u2192 e + \u03bd \u00b5 \u03bd e decay is often referred to as the Michel decay. Precise measurements of these parameters allow to verify the V-A structure of weak interactions and search for possible contributions beyond the SM. The energy spectrum reaches its maximum and has a sharp edge around the kinematical end-point of the electron energy, E e \u223c 52.8 MeV, as shown in Figure 2. A photon with energy E \u03b3 > 10 MeV can be emitted by one of the charge particles involved in the process [21], with a probability of about 1.4%, producing the radiative muon decay (RMD) \u00b5 + \u2192 e + \u03bd \u00b5 \u03bd e \u03b3. The photon emitted in this process can be a virtual photon converting into an e + e \u2212 pair. The resulting \u00b5 + \u2192 e + \u03bd \u00b5 \u03bd e e + e \u2212 decay has a BR of 3.4 \u00d7 10 \u22125 [22].",

The latest results in this field come from the TWIST experiment [8], operated at TRIUMF (Vancouver, CA). Positive muons are used in this experiment, because negative muons tend to be captured by the Coulomb field of the target nuclei, and the decay spectra are distorted with respect to free muons. A muon stopping rate between 2000 and 5000 s \u22121 was available, and a total of 11 \u00d7 10 9 events were collected, although only a portion of the observed spectrum was retained for the final analysis, concentrating on the phase space regions where minimal discrepancies between data and simulations were present, in order to reduce the associated systematic uncertainties. Including all the selection criteria, 0.55 \u00d7 10 9 events were in fact used. The TWIST detector was composed of proportional chambers and drift chambers surrounding a silver or aluminum muon stopping target, minimally degrading the muon polarization, and immersed in a 2 T solenoid field. A sketch of the experiment is shown in Figure 3. A very low reconstruction inefficiency (< 10 \u22124 ) was obtained over the measured phase space region, with a momentum resolution of 58 keV/c at sin \u03b8 e = 1 and a momentum accuracy O(10 \u22124 ). These excellent performances allowed to measure the Michel parameters with high precision [24,25]:",

This feature makes this symmetry prone to be violated in any extension of the SM. Indeed, most NP models predict an enhancement of cLFV, and they are already strongly constrained by the present experimental limits. Supersymmetric (SUSY) models are the most popular choice, and searches for cLFV tends to give strong constraints to them, owing to an interesting feature: even if a SUSY model is built to be lepton-flavor-conserving at some high energy scale, the renormalization group evolution creates unavoidable off-diagonal terms in the slepton mass matrix, producing cLFV effects at a level that is typically measurable in present or next generation experiments (a discussion of cLFV in SUSY, with a reach bibliography, can be found in [40]). It is worth mentioning, anyway, that cLFV effects of the same size typically arise in a plethora of NP models, including theories with extra dimensions [41], multi-Higgs models [42], unparticle physics [43], leptoquarks [44]. The importance of cLFV searches on the development of NP models can be easily understood in the framework of effective field theories (EFT), where non-standard operators are included in the SM lagrangian, suppressed by powers of a characteristic mass scale \u039b. If one assumes coefficients O(1) in front of these new contributions and takes into account the current limits on cLFV, NP is excluded up to thousands of TeV [45]. So we already know that, if we want some physics beyond the SM at the TeV scale, some protection mechanism is likely to exist, that keep the coefficients low enough to satisfy the current bounds.",

In Figure 5 the cLFV predictions of a specific SUSY model [46] are illustrated. Points in the plot correspond to points of the model's parameter space that would give accessible signatures at the LHC, and different scenarios are assumed. It is noticeable that, even within the same model, there are cases where possible LHC signatures are already completely excluded by cLFV searches, and others where cLFV searches can give almost no clue about the LHC reach. This is a typical feature in most models and it makes clear the complementarity between the two kind of searches: both are necessary to increase the chance of making a discovery and, if one is made, both are needed to disclose the flavor structure of the observed NP.",

If the detector is installed within a magnetic field, the positron momentum is also measured. The requirement of using light detectors allows to reduce the deterioration of the resolutions due to the multiple Coulomb scattering, and also reduces the rate of AIF events contributing to the accidental background. For the same reason, the stopping target also needs to be as light as possible, while keeping a high muon stopping efficiency. The strategy adopted to fulfill this requirement consists in the use of a thin planar stopping target, with its normal vector forming a large angle with respect to the beam axis. In this way, positrons exiting around 90 \u2022 with respect to the beam axis see a much lower thickness of target material with respect to the muons. A thin planar target also allows to define the muon decay point by simply propagating the positron track back to the target plane. Combined with a measurement of the photon detection points, it gives for signal events the best estimate of the photon direction (as the line joining the two points), circumventing the typically bad (or even null) angular resolution of \u03b3 detectors. Fast organic scintillators are also used at the end of the positron trajectory to provide a precise timing.",

            "text": "On the photon side, a calorimetric approach with inorganic scintillators guarantees a precise measurement of energy, position and time, typically limited by the properties (light yield and characteristic time) of the scintillating material. The efficiency is mostly limited by the material in front of the calorimeter, because the photon can convert before entering it. It can be relevant, for instance, when the coils of the magnet of a positron spectrometer are present. In the MEG experiment [14], for instance, it determined an inefficiency of about 35%. There is indeed an alternative approach for the photon detection, that consists in placing within the magnetic field a thin layer of dense material where the photon can convert into an e + e \u2212 pair, which can be tracked in the magnetic field in order to infer the photon energy, conversion position and direction. In this case the efficiency is very low, due to the low probability of photon conversion (4.5% in \u223c 0.1 radiation lengths of Lead or Tungsten [48] for 52.8 MeV photons). On the other hand, the reconstruction of the e + e \u2212 pair provides: an excellent energy resolution; an excellent photon position resolution; an information on the photon direction which is not competitive with the resolution provided by the line joining the photon position and the positron vertex, but can be compared to this one in order to determine if the photon really comes from the same point of the positron (which helps to reduce the accidental background). According to the discussion above about the accidental background rate, the resolutions and background rejection of the photon conversion approach allow to increase the beam rate, and it can compensate the loss of efficiency.",

The Crystal Box experiment [49] operated at LAMPF (Los Alamos, USA) in the years 1980s and depicted in Figure 7, was composed of a multilayer cylindrical drift chamber surrounded by scintillator counters for positron timing and a calorimeter made of NaI(Tl) crystals. There was no magnetic field, hence the drift chamber only provided the positron direction, while energy measurements were performed in the calorimeter for both the positron and the electron. The experiment reached E e , E \u03b3 resolutions < 8% (FWHM) at 52.8 MeV, a T e\u03b3 resolution of 1.15 ns (FWHM) dominated by the photon timing in the calorimeter, and a vertex resolution of a few mm.

Running at 4 \u00d7 10 5 \u00b5/s of beam intensity, the experiment collected a statistics corresponding to 1.4 \u00d7 10 12 muons stopped on target. In the parameter space defined by the four discriminating variables E e , E \u03b3 , \u0398 e\u03b3 and T e\u03b3 , in a region around the expected signal values, data were analyzed with a Maximum Likelihood technique (this approach was also used in later experiments).

The times of the PMT pulses determined the times of emission of the particles. Charged particles passed through a multilayer drift chamber that determined their trajectories before they reached the aluminum sieve, located in the lead collimator, served to flatten out the stopped density.

Final beam parameters were measured by the drift chamber with the apparatus triggered on the detection of (a) (b)  photon conversion approach, although the extremely high cost of LXe limited the volume of the detector and hence its acceptance (\u223c 10%). The experiment is depicted in Figure 8. For positron tracking, a set of 16 planar drift chambers was immersed in a magnetic field which was degrading from 1.3 T at the center of the detector to about 0.5 T at the extremities of the magnet, with its main component along the beam axis. This configuration has two advantages: positrons of same momentum make a trajectory with the same bending radius, irrespective of the emission angle, and even tracks emitted at almost 90 \u2022 with respect to the beam axis are expelled from the spectrometer after a few turns. It made possible to keep a high acceptance in the chambers, even if they only cover a small extent in the radial direction, which allows to keep a low pileup of low momentum positrons. The momentum resolution was \u223c 330 keV/c and the angular resolutions around 10 mrad. At the end of their trajectory the positrons reach a set of scintillating bars for positron timing (with 65 ps RMS resolution) and trigger. The experiment run at PSI with 3 \u00d7 10 7 \u00b5/s, collecting up to 7.5 \u00d7 10 14 muons stopped on target. A likelihood analysis was performed, splitting \u0398 e\u03b3 in two components in spherical coordinates, \u03b8 e\u03b3 and \u03c6 e\u03b3 . The distributions of data are shown in Figure 9 along with the probability distribution functions (PDF) used in the likelihood analysis. No excess of signal events was observed and an UL at 90% CL was set, BR(\u00b5 + \u2192 e + \u03b3) < 4.2 \u00d7 10 \u221213 [51]. The MEG collaboration is finalizing the construction of an upgraded detector, MEG-II [52], with significative improvements in all its components. The 16 drift chambers of MEG have been replaced by a unique cylindrical drift chamber, which will provide a better tracking along the full trajectory of the positron, and will reduce the inefficiencies associated in MEG to the long untracked path between the chambers and the positron scintillators. The expected momentum resolution of the spectrometer is expected to be \u223c 130 keV/c while the angular resolutions will be improved by a factor of 2 with respect to MEG. The LXe calorimeter has been instrumented in its inner face with silicon photon detectors (MPPC) [53], giving a higher granularity with respect to PMTs, and hence improving the energy and position resolution of the detector. The energy resolution is expected to be \u223c 1%. The positron scintillating bars are replaced by scintillating tiles, in such a way that many time measurements are performed along the positron trajectory. The average positron time resolution is expected to go below 40 ps. Finally, a new detector has been installed along the beam line in order to identify a possible low energy positron in coincidence with the photon in the LXe calorimeter, which would indicate that the photon itself comes from a RMD and not from a signal event. All the detectors have been installed at the end of 2018 and data taking will start in 2019, for a three year run at 7.7 \u00d7 10 7 \u00b5/s and an expected UL of 6 \u00d7 10 \u221214 on the BR of \u00b5 + \u2192 e + \u03b3.",

Although the present expectations do not exceed significantly the rates already available at PSI, it is an example of a new strategy for the production of intense muon beams. Finally, studies to produce continuous muon beams with rates exceeding 10 9 \u00b5/s are also on going in the framework of the PIP-II project at Fermilab [57]. In [48] we investigate the experimental factors that will ultimately limit the sensitivity of a \u00b5 + \u2192 e + \u03b3 experiment with such large beam rates. While a magnetic spectrometer with gaseous detectors still looks the best choice for the positron reconstruction, the higher rate tolerance of solid state detectors could make them preferable at the highest intensities, although with a significative loss of momentum resolution. Anyway, the performances will be ultimately limited by the interaction of the positrons in the detector material, and namely in the stopping target. It seems difficult, for instance, to reach angular resolutions below 3 mrad. On the photon side, the development of very luminous and fast scintillating crystals like LaBr 3 (Ce) could be a good alternative to LXe. The cost of these materials, anyway, is still very large and could limit the acceptance that can be reasonably reached. The photon conversion technique could be again a good alternative, in particular if very high beam rates are available and a good timing can be obtained with active converters [58]. Taking into account all these limiting factors, a few experimental scenarios have been considered, with calorimetry, photon conversion (one or more layers) and possibly the inclusion of a gaseous or solid state vertex detector to improve the vertex and angle resolutions. As shown in Figure 10, an UL around a few 10 \u221215 could be obtained with standard techniques but a non trivial R&D effort, while breaking the 10 \u221215 level would require a more radical rethinking of the experimental concept.",

There is hence a strong complementarity between searches for cLFV in different channels. The main experimental difference in \u00b5 + \u2192 e + e + e \u2212 with respect to \u00b5 + \u2192 e + \u03b3 comes from the presence of three charged particles whose direction can be precisely measured in a tracking detector, and one can require that they come from the same point within the experimental resolutions. It drastically reduces the likelihood of an accidental coincidence. The main background is thus a radiative muon decay where the photon is virtual and converts internally into e + e \u2212 , i.e. \u00b5 + \u2192 e + e + e \u2212 \u03bd \u00b5 \u03bd e , if the two neutrinos carry a very low fraction of the available energy. On the other hand, the three-body decay kinematics imposes a detector design with a much larger momentum acceptance (compared for instance to MEG, where only tracks with a momentum larger than 40 MeV could be detected), and the only kinematical discriminating variables are the vector sum of the track momenta and the sum of the track energies, which have to be consistent with zero and with the muon mass, respectively.",

With such a design of the target, the beam is spread over a large surface, further reducing the probability of an accidental coincidence. It gives the best compromise between accidental background rejection, stopping efficiency and minimization of the material along the trajectory of the decay products. The momentum resolution of the spectrometer was 1.4 and 0.7 MeV/c in the component parallel and perpendicular to the decay plane, respectively.

The Mu3e detector, sketched in Figure 11, will exploit the most recent developments in the construction of thin silicon detectors, adopting the HVMAPS technology [15]. These devices, composed of a 50 \u00b5m silicon pixel sensor on top of a light 100 \u00b5m kapton structure including the power and signal routing, for a total of less than 10 \u22123 radiation lengths, allow to keep a very low material budget, although the detector resolutions will be still limited by the multiple Coulomb scattering. The experiment will be developed in three phases. The Phase IA detector will be installed on the same beam line used for the MEG experiment, and will be composed of two double layers of silicon detectors, in a 1 T solenoidal magnetic field. A 100 day data taking with 2 \u00d7 10 7 \u00b5/s is expected to start around 2021. In Phase IB two stations of double silicon layers will be added (recurl stations), providing an average resolution of 0.65 MeV on the sum of the track energies, and scintillators (fibers and tiles) will be included for a precise timing, so to exploit the maximum beam rate presently available, \u223c 10 8 \u00b5/s, without being overcome by the accidental background. In Phase II the detector should be moved to the new high-intensity beam line discussed in the Sec. 5.1, with additional tracking and timing stations and an average energy sum resolution of 0.52 MeV.

SINDRUM-II also searched for the process \u00b5 \u2212 Ti \u2192 e + Ca, setting the limit R e\u00b5 < 1.7 \u00d7 10 \u221212 . As an example, figure 13 shows the electron momentum spectrum measured at SINDRUM-II with the Lead target. Three experiments currently aim to get better limits: Mu2e, COMET and DeeMe. In order to reduce the backgrounds deriving from particles other than muons, pulsed beams will be used in these experiments. Indeed, if the data acquisition time window is opened only after a few hundred ns from the arrival of the proton bunch, both the prompt and delayed beam-related backgrounds are strongly suppressed, and one expects no particle to reach the detector, apart from the decay products of the muonic atom. A schematic of the beam structure and acquisition timing is shown    [64] in Figure 12 for the Mu2e experiment. Anyway, one of the main challenges of this generation of experiments is the requirement of keeping below 10 \u221210 the fraction of protons arriving to the muon production target in between two bunches (the extinction of the beam), in order to make the beam-related backgrounds negligible. The Mu2e experiment [12] is under construction at Fermilab, and is sketched in Figure 14. Protons of 8 GeV, in bunches of 200 ns separated by 1695 ns, hit a target immersed in a graded magnetic field going from 2.5 to 4.6 T along the incoming beam direction. Slow pions produced in the target tend to be reflected by the magnetic field in the opposite direction with respect to the incoming protons, and the low momentum muons produced in their decay enter a curved solenoid magnet. In this magnet the muons spiralize around the field direction and are transported toward the muon stopping target. The curved solenoid prevents the passage of neutral particles and, thanks to the field gradients which are necessarily present in the curved sectors, allows to separate positive and negative particles, so that the formers can be removed using collimators. The muons finally reach the stopping target, a set of seventeen 0.02 \u00b5m Aluminum foils (using multiple thin foils allow to reduce the energy loss of the electrons exiting the target while keeping a large stopping power). Aluminum have been chosen as the best compromise between stopping efficiency, material budget seen by the electrons and muonic atom lifetime (880 ns, long enough to wait for prompt beam backgrounds to be strongly suppressed before opening the acquisition window). The magnetic field in the target region also has a gradient from 2   Figure 15: A sketch of the COMET experiment.",

The expected limit is R e\u00b5 < 8 \u00d7 10 \u221217 [66]. The concept of the COMET experiment [67] at J-PARC (Tokai, JP) will be very similar in its first phase.

The detector will be composed of a set of 5 planes of drift tubes, for a total of 4160 detectors, followed by a Gd 2 SiO 5 calorimeter. A momentum resolution of 200 keV/c is expected. In the second phase, the setup will include a second section of the transport solenoid, thus making a C shape, and a second C-shaped solenoid between the stopping target and the detector.

It is also worth mentioning that the interest on light bosons in the mass region that can be explored with muon decays has been also recently boosted by an anomaly emerged in the angular spectrum of e + e \u2212 pairs emitted in the de-excitation of a 8 Be * state, which could be interpreted as the production of a new boson of mass \u223c 16.7 MeV [70], possibly the carrier of a new fundamental force [71].",

The first feature allows to look at a wide range of X masses, the second one provides optimal conditions to look for monoenergetic peaks. The momentum accuracy is of paramount importance in the case of a massless boson, when positrons with energies at the kinematical end point E e = m \u00b5 /2 are expected.

Preliminary studies have been performed at MEG [79] and are planned at MEG-II, although this search will be mostly sensitive to small masses. Indeed, the angular acceptance of the LXe calorimeter of MEG and MEG-II is relatively small (\u2206\u03c6 \u03b3 \u223c 130 \u2022 , \u2206\u03b8 \u03b3 \u223c 50 \u2022 ), and only photon pairs emitted with a small relative angle can be detected, corresponding to events where the decaying particle has a large Lorentz boost, which implies a low mass. The expected limits range from O(10 \u221211 ) for M X \u223c 10 MeV/c 2 to O(10 \u22127 ) at M X \u223c 45 MeV/c 2 .",

Muon decays provide a unique environment to search for new physics, with an excellent sensitivity to a wide range of models and negligible theoretical uncertainties. Measurements of the differential decay rates in \u00b5 + \u2192 e + \u03bd \u00b5 \u03bd e and \u00b5 + \u2192 e + \u03bd \u00b5 \u03bd e \u03b3 currently provide some of the best tests of the V-A structure of weak interactions. A worldwide effort is devoted to the search of lepton-flavor-violating muon decays, with recent results on \u00b5 + \u2192 e + \u03b3 and upcoming improvements by orders of magnitudes in the sensitivity to \u00b5 + \u2192 e + e + e \u2212 , \u00b5 \u2192 e conversion and \u00b5 + \u2192 e + \u03b3 itself. Experiments designed to perform these searches are also sensitive to muon decays where new particles like Goldstone and pseudo-Goldstone bosons are produced. The muon, the first particle to be studied with modern particle physics techniques in the pioneering work by Conversi, Pancini and Piccioni [3], still provides one of the best playgrounds for the development of fundamental physics.",
