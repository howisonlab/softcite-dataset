            "text": "Of all the claims and counterclaims for the so-called \"exotic\" mesons, which do not fit in the pictures of conventional qq mesons [1], the most intriguing one is X(3872). Its existence has been confirmed from numerous measurements, by Belle [2], CDF [3], D0 [4], BaBar [5], LHCb [6] and CMS [7], and its mass, width, and spin are respectively, M (X(3872)) = 3871.69 \u00b1 0.17 MeV, \u0393(X(3872)) < 1.2 MeV, and J P C = 1 ++ [8]. Although many different suggestions for the structure of X(3872) exist in the literature [9][10][11][12], the closeness of the X(3872) mass to the sum of the masses of the D 0 and D * 0 mesons, and the smallness of its width have made the suggestion that it is a weakly bound hadronic molecule made of the D 0 and D * 0 mesons extremely attractive [13]. To submit this provocative suggestion to experimental test it is important to measure the binding energy of X(3872), indeed to determine if it is bound at all. This Letter reports on the results of just such a measurement. Throughout this Letter we use the PDG [8] convention for units, with masses in MeV and momenta in MeV/c, and inclusion of charge-conjugate states is implied.",

Since the discovery of X(3872) in 2003, the precision in the value of the mass of the X(3872) has steadily improved from \u00b1800 keV, originally, to the present average with error of \u00b1170 keV [8] because of numerous improved measurements. Similarly, the precision of the value M (D 0 ) has improved, from \u00b11000 keV, originally, to \u00b1180 keV by a CLEO measurement of M (D 0 ) in 2007 [14], and to \u00b140 keV due to two recent higher-precision measurements of M (D 0 ) by BaBar [15], and our recent publication [16]. As a consequence, the determination of the binding energy of X(3872) as a D 0 D * 0 molecule has changed from (600 \u00b1 600) keV in 2007 [14] to (126 \u00b1 204) keV in 2014 [16].",

As illustrated in Fig. 2, these different decays have different yields, and they populate different ranges of D 0 momenta. The enhancement in D 0 momenta at \u2248 500 MeV arises from e + e \u2212 \u2192 D * 0 D * 0 , and decays of both D * 0 and D * 0 to the corresponding D 0 and D 0 . The enhancement at \u2248 720 MeV arises from e + e \u2212 \u2192 D * 0 D 0 , and D * 0 decaying to D 0 . The enhancement at \u2248 950 MeV arises from e + e \u2212 \u2192 D 0 D 0 . GEANT-based [20] generic Monte Carlo is found to faithfully reproduce both the observed enhancement, and the background, which arises from the other decays of D mesons. Events of interest for the present analysis are those in which at least one D * 0 (or D * 0 ) is formed. In the momentum distributions of Fig. 2, there is an enhancement centered at p(D 0 cand ) \u2248 520 MeV, which arises from events with both D * 0 and D * 0 , which decay into D 0 and D 0 , respectively, and an enhancement at p(D 0 cand ) \u2248 720 MeV which arises from events with only one D * 0 or D * 0 . The yield in the enhancement at p(D 0 cand ) \u2248 520 MeV is, as expected, nearly a factor four larger than that in the enhancement at p(D 0 cand ) \u2248 720 MeV. We reconstruct D * 0 (or D * 0 ) candidates for the events in the enhancements at p(D 0 cand ) \u2248 520 MeV and p(D 0 cand ) \u2248 720 MeV, and construct the distributions for \u2206M \u2261 M (D * 0 cand ) \u2212 M (D 0 cand ).

By rescaling the \u03c0 0 photon energies by \u00b10.4%, we determine the resulting uncertainty in \u2206M . In Ref. [16], we made a precision determination of the CLEO solenoid B-field with an uncertainty of factor 0.4 \u00d7 10 \u22124 . This results in \u00b13 keV uncertainty in \u2206M . The uncertainty in signal shape is estimated using making alternate fits of the \u2206M spectra by a single Gaussian in the restricted range of \u2206M = 141 \u2212 143 MeV. The systematic error in background shape was obtained by increasing the order of the polynomial used in the fit by one unit. The PDG2014 mass of the K \u00b1 has an uncertainty of \u00b116 keV [8]. It leads to \u00b13 keV uncertainty in \u2206M . Contributions to the systematic uncertainties derived from variations of event selection requirements in M (D 0 cand ) ( Fig. 1), p(D 0 cand ) (Fig. 2), and M (\u03b3\u03b3) are seperately listed in Table II. Adding all systematic uncertainties in quadrature, the total systematic uncertainty is estimated to be \u00b116 keV in \u2206M (K\u03c0) and \u2206M (K3\u03c0).",

Our measurement, based on 10,041 counts, has factor \u2248 3.5 smaller overall uncertainty, and has 113 keV smaller value of \u2206M . The present measurement (Eq. 7), \u2206M = 142.007 \u00b1 0.021 MeV, and the latest average of D 0 mass, M (D 0 ) = 1864.843 \u00b1 0.044 MeV, [16] lead to M (D * 0 ) = 2006.850 \u00b1 0.049 MeV. (8) This compares with the value M (D * 0 ) = 2006.96 \u00b1 0.10 MeV obtained by the PDG2014 [8] from a simultaneous fit of four masses, M (D * + ), M (D * 0 ), M (D + ), and M (D 0 ). Our measured masses lead to M (D * 0 ) + M (D 0 ) = 3871.693 \u00b1 0.090 MeV. Using M (X(3872)) = 3871.69 \u00b1 0.12 MeV [8] we obtain the binding energy of X(3872) as a proposed D 0 D * 0 molecule, E b \u2261 (3871.693 \u00b1 0.090) \u2212 (3871.69 \u00b1 0.17) MeV = = 3 \u00b1 192 keV.
