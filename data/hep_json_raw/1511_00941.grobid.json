            "text": "Interest in the precise measurement of neutrinonucleus cross-sections has grown in recent years due to their effect on the interpretation of neutrino oscillation data. Few precise measurements exist for \u03bd and\u03bd neutral current (NC) neutral pion (\u03c0 0 ) production [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11]. Crosssection uncertainties for neutral current neutrino scattering become important as precision oscillation measurements attempt to measure charge-parity violation in the neutrino sector (\u03b4 CP mixing parameter) [12] and disentangle the neutrino mass hierarchy question. The NC\u03c0 0 channel is of particular importance to neutrino oscillation experiments as it can be experimentally misidentified as \u03bd e or\u03bd e charged current production. This misidentification complicates the interpretation of \u03bd \u00b5 \u2192 \u03bd e appearance oscillation measurements, which are required for the detection of neutrino CP violation.",

This detector technology offers exemplary electromagnetic shower reconstruction capabilities as well as electron/photon discrimination ability, as recently demonstrated by the ICARUS and ArgoNeuT collaboration [18,19]. While a previous measurement of the energy reconstruction of \u03c0 0 mesons from cosmic ray production has been performed for LArTPC's [20], prior to the measurement presented in this paper, no direct measurement of the neutral current neutrino-argon interaction rate has been performed. The difficulty of identifying NC\u03c0 0 interactions in neutrino experiments has lead to few measurements of this process and thus the uncertainty in the cross-section is often a large systematic in \u03bd e appearance oscillation measurements. The characterization of the NC\u03c0 0 production in a LArTPC has increased importance as these LArTPC experiments attempt to disentangle possible hints of new physics from \u03bd e appearance as reported by the LSND collaboration [21] and the Mini-BooNE collaboration [22].",

Moreover this e/\u03b3 discrimination allows LArTPCs the ability to better characterize the dominant background, namely mis-identified \u03c0 0 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3. In order to accomplish this, precise characterization of NC\u03c0 0 production is of the utmost importance. Fig. 1 shows the predicted production cross-section for semi-inclusive NC\u03c0 0 utilizing both the GENIE [23] and NuWro [24] neutrino event generators. Both generators predict similar cross-sections in the lower energy region (<10 GeV), however the NuWro event generator only includes \u2206 resonant production of the \u03c0 0 meson, and is thus known to become deficient at higher energies. This known difference does not impact this analysis since the neutrino energies we are interested in are below 10 GeV. Accurate modelling of this production requires knowledge of both the underlying neutrino-nucleon interactions and of final state interactions. In this paper we present the first measurement of neutrino induced NC\u03c0 0 production on an argon target. The interaction final state utilized in this analysis is defined as:",

In the instance where multiple photons are observed in the final state, all possible combinations of photon pairs are considered when attempting to reconstruct the \u03c0 0 meson from where the photons originated. This definition differs slightly from much of the historical neutral current \u03c0 0 data [2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11] which typically require one and only one \u03c0 0 meson and little other activity in the detector (typically a single proton). This definition is used in this analysis to help mitigate the low statistics of the data sample. This difference in final state definition, in addition to the neutrino scattering occurring off a much higher Z nuclei such as argon, complicates any direct comparison to historic data. However, where possible comparisons are made to previous measurements. Fig. 2 shows a simulated Monte Carlo (MC) NC\u03c0 0 event inside ArgoNeuT. This particular event demonstrates the semi-inclusive topology in which the neutrino interacts with the nucleus and causes the ejection of a single \u03c0 0 meson and a large number of other final state particles. This \u03c0 0 then immediately decays into a pair of photons that convert to electron / positron (e + e \u2212 ) pairs a distance characteristic of the 14 cm radiation length of liquid argon from the neutrino interaction point (referred to as the event vertex). The ionization caused by the e + e \u2212 pair thus registers on the read-out wires as two clusters of charge (\"showers\") pointing back to a common vertex. In order to identify and reconstruct these NC\u03c0 0 events, the analysis proceeds in four parts.",

This analysis utilized the MINOS Near Detector (MINOS-ND), a 0.98 kton magnetized steel-scintillator calorimeter [28], for non-contained muons exiting in the forward direction to determine the sign of the outgoing lepton and thus could distinguish the species of neutrino interaction as well as the momentum for that lepton.

For the numerator in Eq. 7 and Eq. 8, the neutral current channel, the technique of utilizing the MINOS-ND to distinguish the species of neutrino is not possible. Instead, a MC based estimate on the NuMI beam composition is used to estimate the fraction of NC\u03c0 0 events that come from \u03bd and\u03bd interactions. This means that the number extracted for N \u03bd (N C\u03c0 0 ) is anti-correlated with N\u03bd(N C\u03c0 0 ) and thus the ratio extracted is also anticorrelated.

These events can fail the anti-matching because the muon produced in a charged current interaction does not exit in the direction of the MINOS-ND or because the track is poorly reconstructed and thus does not match back to the track found in MINOS-ND. To reject these events we utilize the reconstruction information from inside the ArgoNeuT TPC and veto an event that has a topology consistent with having a muon originating from a neutrino interaction vertex, as expected in a charged current interaction. These events must have at least two tracks that are identified as either a muon/proton, muon/pion or muon/muon pair emanating from a common vertex. This selection was chosen over simply removing any event with a minimum ionizing track (MIP) present in the event in order to preserve the statistics of the selected sample and avoid removing neutral current events with charged pions in the final state that are incorrectly identified. The dominant inefficiency comes from multiple misidentification of charged pions as muons thus causing NC\u03c0 0 events to be incorrectly excluded from the sample. However, this is a relatively small inefficiency compared to other selection criteria. The choice to not reject any event with a minimum ionizing track was made to help increase the statistics of the sample of candidate NC\u03c0 0 events where, in addition to the neutral pion, charged pions and high momentum protons which exit the chamber are present.",

The selection accomplishes this identification by analyzing the components of an electromagnetic shower as if it is made of many small tracks and attempting to identify the starting \"trunk\" of the shower. The electromagnetic nature of short tracks can be verified by a particle identification (PID) procedure that correlates energy loss in the TPC, dE/dX, with the range of the tracks in liquid argon, as well as taking into account the topological reconstruction of the small tracks. This also allows for a determination of the energy of each track. Fig. 3 shows a simulated event where the electromagnetic showers have been broken into smaller components based on their track-like structure. Importantly, the beginning of the shower is reliably reconstructed as a small track component of the shower and can be identified by analyzing the reconstructed components.",

Short tracks with a PID assignment consistent with that of a muon, pion, or proton are removed from consideration. Next, pairs of small tracks are kept for consideration if their start points are separated by at least 4.0 cm. This requirement identifies pairs of small tracks coming from a pair of photons that are separated in space removing highly ionizing parts of a single shower that have been broken into many small tracks while preserving the unique starting portion of the distinct shower pairs. Next we require greater than 75 % of the first 4 cm of the track to have a dE/dX value \u2265 3.5 MeV/cm. If the track is shorter than 4 cm in length than the requirement is that the majority (\u2265 50%) track have a dE/dX \u2265 3.5 MeV/cm. This selection is designed to only keep highly ionizing short tracks, such as those coming from a photon conversion into an e + e \u2212 pairs, and reject those likely due to a minimum ionizing particle. Finally, to separate distinct photon conversions from the background of electron and single photon, we cluster the hits in the event using a density based spatial clustering algorithm (DBSCAN) and require that any small track share less than 85% of its hits with any other small track from within the same DBSCAN based cluster. This DBSCAN algorithm groups together nearby distributions of charge and associates them into one object.

In order to do this, the energy of the shower must be obtained. However, as will be discussed further in Section V, the majority of photon showers coming from \u03c0 0 decays are not contained within the ArgoNeuT detector. Fig. 4 demonstrates the problem by plotting the reconstructed energy of the candidate data events compared to the true MC Energy for NC\u03c0 0 events and the simulated deposited energy inside the active volume of the detector. However, utilizing the fine grain tracking detection of LArTPC's, it is possible to reconstruct the angle of the photons given the visible portion of the shower in the detector. Fig. 5 shows the distribution for the candidate NC\u03c0 0 data events compared to the simulated deposited angle calculated using the charge weighting of the visible shower and the MC true angle. Using the reconstructed start point and angle of the shower, made possible by the tracking capabilities of the detector, the data closely tracks the true angles. The well-reconstructed shower angles permit extraction of information about the energy and momentum of the event by utilizing the assumption that the two electromagnetic showers originate from the decay of \u03c0 0 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 and constructing the opening angle between the two photons (\u03b8 \u03b3\u03b3 ).

The distribution tracks well with the true information up to small opening angle, where the reconstruction has difficulty disentangling the two showers. This provides confidence to the hypothesis that these events do in fact come from a \u03c0 0 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 and we will utilize this ability to reconstruct angles well within a LArTPC in the next section to attempt to correct back the missing energy.",

Utilizing this assumption, a relationship between the opening angle of the two photons, \u03b8 \u03b3\u03b3 , and the momentum of the \u03c0 0 , P \u03c0 0 , is derived. This relationship provides the basis for the application of the subsequent energy corrections.

The result of the fit returns a mean value for the Gaussian of 140.2\u00b10.8 MeV with a width of 37.5\u00b10.61 MeV (to be compared to M \u03c0 0 = 135 MeV). This demonstrates that the template based energy corrections do adjust back the photon's energy closer to its true energy and thus give us another tool to identify candidate NC\u03c0 0 events.",

            "text": "Utilizing one of the great strength's of the LArTPC technology, its fine grain tracking information, allows for reconstruction of the angle of an electromagnetic shower despite very little of the shower being contained. This was demonstrated in Section IV and Fig. 15 shows the performance of the shower reconstruction on simulated \u03c0 0 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 events using the hand-scan and auto-mated shower reconstruction tools described in Section III. These tools faithfully reconstruct the true angle of the photon shower and thus the angular reconstruction can be trusted to represent the underlying true photon angles. This information becomes very useful when attempting to correct back the energy loss of a shower due to poor containment. Specifically, it provides another method to calculate a hypothesis for the initial momentum the \u03c0 0 based on the opening angle between the pair of photons in the event (\u03b8 \u03b3\u03b3 ). As mentioned previously, Fig. 8 shows the strong correlation between the initial momentum of the \u03c0 0 and the opening angle \u03b8 \u03b3\u03b3 . Fig. 16 provides the two dimensional (2D) distribution from which the fitted function, Eq. 10, that defines the \u03c0 0 momentum as a function of the opening angle between the photons. The constants from the fit are C 0 = 2202.3, C 1 = -94.9, C 2 = 2.1, C 3 = -0.025, C 4 = 0.00017, C 5 = -6.0\u00d710 \u22127 , C 6 = 8.5\u00d710 \u221210 . Comparing the difference between the momentum of the \u03c0 0 calculated utilizing Eq. 10 and the momentum utilizing Eq. 3, as is done in Figure 8, shows that the angle method reconstructs the momentum to within \u00b130% with a slight bias towards overestimating the momentum. While this accuracy is insufficient to directly extract the physics of the \u03c0 0 system, using this as a starting point for our energy correction calculation is sufficient. By being able to bound the hypothesis for the momentum of the \u03c0 0 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 we can then go about deriving energy corrections using topological information. Fig. 18 shows the fraction of the contained energy (as defined in Eq. 9) as a function of the initial true momentum of the \u03c0 0 .",

For example, as is illustrated on the left of Fig. 19, a shower that is created at the front (small Z) of the detector but is pointed down (negative Y) will have worse shower containment when compared to a shower that is created at the same point but is pointed up (positive Y). FIG. 19. Illustration of the topological layout of an electromagnetic shower (represented as a yellow cone) and the direction the shower is propagating. The left hand side represents two showers created at the same Z location but with different Y initial positions.

A Gaussian plus linear function is fitted to the data, yielding an invariant mass of 131.1 \u00b1 8.4 MeV with a width of 81.4 \u00b1 11.1 MeV. After requiring events with an invariant mass between 60 MeV\u2264 M \u03b3\u03b3 \u2264240 MeV, we reconstruct the invariant mass with a peak of 138.4 \u00b1 7.0 MeV and a width of 54.7 \u00b1 7.2 MeV. The fitted mean is consistent with the 135 MeV \u03c0 0 mass taking into account statistical uncertainties and the systematic energy scale error associated with the energy correction scheme.",

In this appendix we provide a detailed overview of the procedures used to generate the energy correction templates used in this analysis and initially described in Section V C. We begin with a discussion of the angle reconstruction seen for single particle \u03c0 0 MC that becomes the basis of the template approach to applying energy corrections. This is followed by a detailing of the various energy correction procedures and templates that are applied. Finally, a summary of the cross-checks that were performed showing the robustness of the energy corrections is presented.",
