Among the many fascinating aspects of this subject, this review is dedicated to direct CP violation in non-leptonic decays. The advances within the last decade have been enormous, driven by the increasingly large samples of b-and c-hadron decays, and have led to very interesting results such as large CP asymmetries in charmless B decays and the observation of direct CP violation in the charm sector. We address the quest for understanding the origin of strong phases, the importance of final state interactions and the relation with CP T symmetry, and different approaches to measure direct CP violation in these decays. The main experimental results and their implications are then discussed.",

Just a few years before, Landau presented a convincing theory showing CP conservation to play a key role in understanding particle-antiparticle symmetry [2]. At that time, no one had disagreed with this fundamental idea and, as a consequence, there was no theory predicting the CP symmetry breaking. Among several arguments for CP to be a good symmetry, a compelling one was that, assuming CP T symmetry to be exact (a consequence of Lorentz invariance), the reversibility of time would naturally lead to CP conservation. The observation of CP violation meant, for the first time in physics, the irreversibility of some processes at the fundamental level.",

They included a third quark family, which extended the 2 \u00d7 2 Cabibbo mixing matrix [4] to a 3 \u00d7 3 matrix, the now called Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix, allowing the presence of a complex phase in the hadronic sector of the weak interaction. The two new quarks, beauty and top, were experimentally observed in 1977 [5] and 1995 [6,7], respectively, and finally CP violation was observed in B decays, as predicted, in 2001 [8,9]. Kobayashi and Maskawa received the Nobel Prize in 2008 for the confirmation of their CP violation mechanism within the Standard Model (SM).",

In Sect. 2, we discuss the fundamental ideas regarding direct CP violation and call attention on how CP T conservation enters as a constraint for decay modes with the same final-state flavour content. In Sect. 3 the major experiments and main strategies for measuring direct CP violation observables are discussed. Particular emphasis is given on the importance of multi-body decays, for which CP violation effects can appear, and be enhanced, in specific regions of their phase space. Direct CP violation in charmless b-hadron decays is presented in Sect. 4, followed by Sect. 5 where a complementary discussion on double-charm contributions to the charmless final states is considered. Section 6 is dedicated to B decays to open charm, which represent the ideal environment for the measurement of \u03b3. Section 7 addresses the charm sector, contextualising the field after the first observation of direct CP violation and discussing the current status and prospects for many other modes. Finally, we present our conclusions in Sect. 8.",

The tree amplitude with b \u2192 u transition has the CKM weak phase \u03b3, and a strong, short-distance phase may arise from a penguin amplitude. Both contributions are shown in  For the penguin operator to produce a strong phase, the intermediate particles need to be on-shell [40,43].

Within the Wolfenstein parameterisation [20], the tree topology amplitude is proportional to \u03bb and for the penguin topology the relevant contribution is with the b quark in the loop, which carries the weak phase \u03b3 at \u03bb 5 level, so the interference term appears with a \u03bb 4 dependence relative to the leading term.

Within the last 10 years or so, many experiments, such as D\u2205, CDF, CLEO, and BESIII, have contributed to direct CP violation measurements, but largely the bulk of results comes from BaBar, Belle and LHCb.

They both relied on a copious production of B + B \u2212 and B 0 B 0 pairs at the \u03a5 (4S) bottonium resonance, corresponding to a centre-of-mass energy of 10.58 GeV. The PEPII machine provided e \u2212 and e + beams to BaBar at energies of 9.0 and 3.1 GeV, respectively, while KEKB machine, for Belle, had e \u2212 and e + energies at 8.0 and 3.5 GeV, respectively. The energy-asymmetric beams were designed to provide the BB pair a boost in the laboratory, in order for the B-decay vertices to be well separated from the production vertex. The B 0 B 0 pair were produced as an entangled quantum system, and by measuring the flavour of one B meson at its decay vertex through a flavour-specific mode it was possible to determine the flavour of the other (conjugate) B meson. Since charm mesons are common decay products of B mesons, BaBar and Belle had also a significant impact on charm physics. With e \u2212 e + collisions producing low hadronic background, and an almost 4\u03c0 of geometrical coverage, the experiments were very efficient for reconstructing both charged and neutral final-state particles. The BaBar experiment ran from 1999 to 2008 and cumulated about 424 fb \u22121 of data at the \u03a5 (4S) resonance while Belle ran from 1999 to 2010, cumulating 711 fb \u22121 at the same energy. 7 For further details, a nice review can be found in Ref.

The LHCb is a single-arm forward detector with an angular coverage corresponding to the pseudorapidity in the range 2 < \u03b7 < 5, taking advantage that b and c hadrons are produced at relatively small angles with respect to the pp beam direction. In contrast to e \u2212 e + machines, the initial state is not known for pp collisions at the LHC; the main mechanism for heavy-flavour production is gluon-gluon fusion, and a typical event may produce a hundred charged particles. For illustration, a comparison of the event profiles at Belle and LHCb is shown in Fig. 4. To distinguish the b-and c-hadron decay products from a large background, LHCb relies on an efficient and reliable trigger system, capable of full online reconstruction, exploiting the topological characteristics of the desired decay processes. The reconstruction of neutrals, nevertheless, are not very efficient when compared to that from low-occupation e \u2212 e + collisions. Another important difference, very relevant for CP violation studies, is that the initial state is not CP symmetric and this leads to particleantiparticle production asymmetries that have to be considered (subtracted) for the study of (or search for) CP asymmetries. The data was taken in two periods: run I with collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV in 2011 and at 8 TeV in 2012, with integrated luminosities of 1 fb \u22121 and 2 fb \u22121 , respectively; and run II, from 2015 to 2018, at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV with an integrated luminosity of 6 fb \u22121 . While the great majority of LHCb analyses based on run I data are completed, many studies based on run II data are still under progress, and we shall expect new results throughout the next few years. Meanwhile, the Belle II experiment [86,87] has started its physics run in 2019 and will continue until 2025. All components of the detector are new or highly upgraded with respect to the former Belle detector to be able to operate at an event rate 40 times higher than before, now provided by the SuperKEKB accelerator [88]. As KEKB, the e \u2212 e + collisions occur at centre-of-mass energies in the region of the \u03a5 resonances, mainly the \u03a5 (4S). The expected integrated luminosity is 50ab \u22121 .",

The distribution of events throughout the phase space is the result of the superposition of the various amplitudes, and the interference pattern depends directly on the strong and weak phases involved. The rich dynamics potentially allow different sources of strong phases to appear. It is natural to expect localised CP asymmetries to be stronger than phase-space integrated ones, and can even change sign.

The first term allows for a possible non-resonant contribution, with magnitude a nr , phase \u03b4 nr and the shape A nr usually assumed to be a constant for D decays and an exponential or a single-pole function for B decays [94][95][96][97]. The Dalitz plot is fitted allowing for CP violation, that is, a n and \u03b4 n , for the decay of P meson, and\u0101 n and\u03b4 n , for the decay ofP meson, are independent fit parameters. The isobar approach, while simple, has limitations. One of them is the assumption that the companion hadron (that not resulting from the decaying resonance) does not take part in the dynamics. This is the 2+1 or quasi-two-body approximation and is discussed below in Sect. 3.3.2. The other is that it is known to be fairly good only for narrow, non-overlapping resonances with the same quantum numbers. There are examples of three-or four-body B and D decays where low-mass ( 2 GeV) broad scalar resonances are very important or even dominant. Assuming the 2+1 approximation to be exact, the simple sum of relativistic Breit-Wigners would not preserve two-body unitarity. 8 To overcome such a problem, some analyses have been using alternative approaches for the parameterisation of the S-wave. One is a quasi-model-independent approach, where the S-wave amplitude is binned throughout the two-body invariant mass range to fit for its amplitude and phase in each bin, as in Refs. [99][100][101][102]. Another one is the K-matrix approach [103], which imposes two-body unitarity by using external data from scattering experiments, as in Refs. [102,104].",

From the amplitude fit, a CP asymmetry for each individual amplitude can be defined in terms of the magnitudes. For instance, for the \u03c1(770) 0 amplitude",

As such, this term drives a change of sign of the asymmetry throughout the phase space, the inflexion region being around cos \u03b8 \u2248 0. Yet, this factor multiplies terms related to the complex nature of the Breit-Wigner. When s 12 crosses the resonance nominal mass m 2 n (either \u03c1(770) 0 or f 0 (980)), the CP asymmetry associated with this contribution tends to change sign. This effect has been seen on data in the decays B \u00b1 \u2192 \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + and B \u00b1 \u2192 K \u00b1 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + as discussed later in Sect. 4.2.1. This S-and P-wave interference term, integrated in the whole phase space, must be equal to zero due to orthogonality, and consequently the net CP asymmetry coming from the third term should be equal to zero. The integrated asymmetry may still receive contributions from the first and second terms though. In Sect. 3.3.2, we discuss that, by strictly assuming the 2+1 approximation, CP violation involving light vector mesons should be very small.",

They use a simple model implementing three-body unitarity, solving the Faddeev equation. The first-order rescattering interaction is represented through a vectorresonance intermediate state as shown in Fig. 6. Additional contributions can be added by including higherorder loops in a transition matrix that sums the connected scattering series from a ladder graph [114,115], as shown in Fig. 7. In this figure, three-body rescattering effects in these decays have been classified as a direct term, with a small correction to the Breit-Wigner lineshape [116], and an induced term, with a possible presence of a resonant term to the same three-body final state [117]. Figure 8 presents the Dalitz plot distribution for these two terms.  [99]. The band shows the result of the Isobar model fit in a previous work [118]. The hashed vertical line shows the elastic range according to LASS [105]. For three-body charmless B decays, with a much larger phase space, the 2 + 1 approximation would be expected to be less problematic. However, depending on the momentum distribution of the final-state particles in the Dalitz plot, the validity of the approximation is better in some regions than in others. For instance, in the B-meson rest frame, the corners of the Dalitz plot (see Fig. 9) correspond to a configuration  in which one particle is at rest. The midway between the corners corresponds to a configuration where two of the particles are colinear, thus having the same scalar momentum as the third particle. The centre of the Dalitz plot has all three particles with the same scalar momentum. Thus the validity of the 2+1 approximation may be better in some regions than in others. The participation of the third particle in the two-body interaction can change the two-body strong phase over the Dalitz plot and should be taken into account in CP violation studies.",

Figure 10 In the case of presence of a measurable CP violation effect, the method above is very sensitive to it, giving p-values incompatible with the null hypothesis, and it is possible to distinguish the regions in the Dalitz plot with substantial S CP values, but otherwise gives no quantification. A \"second generation\" Miranda technique [123] is dedicated to the measurement of CP asymmetries across the phase space. The method strengthens local effects by obtaining asymmetries through the division of the Dalitz plot in bins of equal population for the combined samples of particle and antiparticle decays: each bin has N tot i = N i (P ) + N i (P ) events. In Fig. 11 a simulation of B 0 \u2192 K 0 S \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decays is shown, where CP violation was introduced as a 60 \u2022 phase difference in the \u03c1(770) 0 K 0 S mode. In the left plot, localised positive and negative asymmetries are clearly seen, reaching values as high as 80%, although the total integrated asymmetry is only about 1%. In the right plot, the distribution of asymmetries is shown. This is a clear example evidencing how CP violation effects can be substantially stronger in regions of the phase space when compared to the total, integrated, CP effect.",

If localised CP asymmetries are present, the last term in Eq. 30 is smaller, since the average distances are larger, when compared to a scenario with no asymmetries, and the T value will be larger. To do this comparison and access a p-value for the hypothesis of CP conservation, the nominal T value is compared to a distribution of T values obtained from permutation samples (associating randomly the \"flavour\" -P orP -to all events for each permutation sample). When compared to the binned technique, the energy test has been shown to have equivalent or higher sensitivity to CP violation effects [126]. An alternative unbinned technique is the k-nearest neighbour (kNN) method [127,128]. Instead of using a metric function to define an effective region around each event, a given number of nearest neighbours is defined and among them the number of particle and antiparticle events are evaluated. Similar to the energy-test method, a test statistic T is constructed for the whole phase space (or for phase-space regions)",

From the short-distance point of view, these decay channels are equivalent -the dominant quark-level diagrams coincide with the only difference being the spectator quark, d quark for B 0 and u quark for B + and the colour-suppressed tree contribution.

Rich CP violation patterns can be seen along the Dalitz plots, with positive (red) and negative (blue) CP asymmetries coexisting in the same final state. Since the source of weak phase for all these charmless B decays is the CKM angle \u03b3, the CP asymmetry variations over the Dalitz plot have to come from the variation of the strong phase. The Miranda distributions evidence the richness involved in the CP violation dynamics of these decays. A discussion on these features follows. ",

Three different models for the scalar amplitude were used: the isobar model with \u03c3(500) pole and a \u03c0\u03c0 \u2212 KK rescattering amplitude, the K-matrix formalism, and the QMI-PWA method. Resonant amplitudes for spin-1 and spin-2 were included through the isobar model for the three approaches. The general agreement between these three approaches was good. The dominant amplitudes for this decay were found to be the \u03c1(770) 0 \u03c0 + amplitude, with about 50% fit fraction, followed by the S-wave amplitude with about 25% fit fraction. Within the isobar model, the phase difference between the charged conjugated decays B \u2212 \u2192 \u03c3(500)\u03c0 \u2212 and B + \u2192 \u03c3(500)\u03c0 + , measured with respect to that of the \u03c1(770) 0 \u03c0 \u00b1 components, was measured to be about 60 \u2022 [102], confirming the interference trend presented in Fig. 16, with zeros at the \u03c1(770) 0 nominal mass. The conservation of CP symmetry in the interference between S-and P-wave was excluded with a significance of 25\u03c3.",

The B \u00b1 average fit fraction for the rescattering contribution is found to be about 23% while presenting the largest CP asymmetry observed for a single amplitude, with a measured value of A CP = (\u221266 \u00b1 4 \u00b1 2).  The same amplitude is also included in the amplitude analysis for the B [102,143]. The total contribution for this channel is much lower than that obtained in B + \u2192 \u03c0 + K + K \u2212 . However, when compared to the K + K \u2212 mass spectrum in the rescattering region, the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 mass spectrum has different resonant contributions, including part of the broad and scalar \u03c3(500) and the tensor f 2 (1270), both with significant important positive CP asymmetries, as outlined in the next sub-section. It would be important to perform a coupled-channel amplitude analysis -in particular a simultaneous fit for B + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and B + \u2192 \u03c0 + K + K \u2212 decays -to clarify better a possible correlation between \u03c0\u03c0 and KK amplitudes through rescattering as a way to understand the CP violation mechanisms involved.",

This is probably related to the richness of the hadronic processes in a multi-body decay, where different sources of strong phases, necessary to observe CP violation, are possible. The CP T constraint has to enter somehow connecting final states with the same flavour content: resonant states usually have more than one decay channel, so a natural interconnection of CP asymmetries may arise. Moreover, possible rescattering involving the companion pseudoscalar, and as such breaking the 2+ 1 approximation, can be of some importance, at least in a part of the phase space.",

On the other hand, a long-distance contribution can also be possible by a similar process to that in Fig. 26 in the decay B + \u2192 K + K + K \u2212 . The interference between these short-distance tree component and double-charm rescattering, carrying no weak phase, may lead to a signature of CP violation spread throughout the phase space. By inspecting the bottom-left plot in Fig. 15, indeed there is a significant CP asymmetry in the high \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 mass regions.",

As discussed above in Sect. 5.2, the latter amplitude has a strong-phase sign change when it passes from off-shell to on-shell, and this effect could be responsible for the CP asymmetry pattern observed in the bottom-left plot in Fig. 15 near the DD thresholds. A simulation for this model, using Laura++ [177] generator, is shown in Fig. 27. Another recent study [178] also discusses the potential role of open-charm threshold amplitudes to the observed CP violation in this decay channel. In a similar way, the model exploits the interference between light resonances with both open-charm DD amplitudes and high-mass charmonium resonances. The CP asymmetry pattern obtained through the interference between \u03c1(770) 0 and the propagator for \u03c7 c0 (3860) scalar resonance is illustrated in Fig. 28.",

[173], and, if so, one may infer the importance of a double charm re-scattering in this decay. In other words, if the CP violation pattern for both the \u03c7 c0 component and the non-resonant component (covering a wider mass region) are similar, this would point towards the interpretation of the non-resonant amplitude receiving an important contribution from the double-charm loop mechanism.   . The collaboration searched also for a possible non-charmonium component to B + c \u2192 \u03c0 + K + K \u2212 decay, but no significant contribution was found. From short-distance calculations [180], this contribution indeed should be helicity suppressed.

When compared to indirect determinations coming from fits with CKM constraints, such as from CKM-Fitter [78] and UTFit [79] collaborations, the central value of \u03b3 above is higher and marginally compatible. The smaller indirect values are driven by the determination of the mass split in B \u2212B system through mixing measurements [209,210]. If NP effects appear at tree level, the value of \u03b3 from direct determination can differ substantially from that of indirect measurements [211].

Although the effect soon after faded with new measurements from LHCb [217,218] it created a lot of excitement in the theoretical community in order to try to understand whether the effect -almost at the percent level -could still be explained by the SM, via penguin enhancements, SU (3) F breaking, long-distance effects [73,74,[219][220][221][222][223][224][225][226][227][228][229] or would require the contribution of new physics dynamics [230][231][232][233][234][235][236][237][238][239][240][241][242].

A few years ago, Belle [256] and CLEO [257] have measured CP asymmetries for D + \u2192 \u03b7 \u03c0 + and D + s \u2192 \u03b7 \u03c0 + above the 1% and 2% level, respectively.

The last uncertainty is due to external measurements of the asymmetry of the control modes. The Cabibbo-suppressed mode D + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 0 has the same dominant tree diagram as D 0 \u2192\u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + , with the only change in the spectator quark. But since the final state has isospin I = 2, it cannot proceed through a gluonic-penguin amplitude. Thus, in this case there is no weak phase contributing from the SM and the expected CP asymmetry is null; any sign of CP violation would be indication of New Physics mechanisms. In 2018, Belle searched for CP violation in this mode with its full data sample, with an integrated luminosity of 921 fb \u22121 sample [259]. The D + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 0 decay was reconstructed both from D * + \u2192 D + \u03c0 0 (tagged) and directly from the interaction point (not tagged).

Clearly, given the limited sizes of decay samples, the sensitivity to charge asymmetries may vary substantially depending on the phase space region. Since there is no hint in which region CP violation may be potentially enhanced, the study is challenging. For instance, for the Miranda technique bins should in principle be defined in 5 dimensions, preferably with adaptive binning to control the minimum number of events in each bin, with a careful study of the binning scheme in order not to lose sensitivity. This also applies for the energy-test technique where the parameter \u03b4 defines an effective radius in phase space.

The p-values under the no CP violation hypothesis were found to be 9.1% and 41%, indicating consistency with CP symmetry. With the full run I data sample, comprising about 1 million signal decays, the D 0 \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + mode was then studied by LHCb via the energy test technique -and also dividing the total sample into four sub-samples depending on the sign of a triple-product C T and on the D 0 flavour [281]. As such, the analysis could be sensitive to both P -even and P -odd CP asymmetries. From simulation, sensitivity for CP violation effects is found to be typically 4-5% in amplitudes or 3-4 \u2022 in phases for the main intermediate states. The results have p-values of (4.3 \u00b1 0.6)% and (0.6 \u00b1 0.2)% for P -even and P -odd CP violation tests, respectively, obtained from the distribution of permutation T-values. Interestingly, the P -odd CP -violation test was found to be only marginally consistent with CP conservation -this can be seen in Fig. 40, where the right plot indicates the \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + invariant-mass region where the discrepancies are found.",

The measurement of \u03b3 with a current precision of about 5 \u2022 is a remarkable result and \u03b3 is, indeed, the only angle that have been measured exclusively from a direct CP violation measurement, involving only tree-level amplitudes in B decays to D plus light mesons.",

Indeed, there is a long-term discussion about the relative importance of the short-versus long-distance contributions as sources of the strong phases. On this subject, much progress was obtained within the last years, mainly due to the recent experimental results.",

In quasi two-body modes, first observations of CP asymmetry were made for B + \u2192 \u03c3(500)\u03c0 + , B + \u2192 f 2 (1270)\u03c0 + and B 0 \u2192 K * + \u03c0 \u2212 decays while no significant asymmetry was found in the B + \u2192 \u03c1(770)\u03c0 + mode. Big surprises came from three-body charmless B + decays. Rich patterns of large CP asymmetries across the Dalitz plot were observed, with regions of positive and negative A CP . Since the source of weak phase from the SM in these decays comes only from the angle \u03b3, the structures need to arise from the variation of the strong phase. Moreover, these results point towards the importance of long-distance hadronic phases. A particular result is the large CP asymmetry of about 66% associated to the rescattering region KK \u2194 \u03c0\u03c0 in the decay B + \u2192 K \u2212 K + \u03c0 + . Another unforeseen result was the pattern of large CP asymmetries at high \u03c0\u03c0 masses in the decay B + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , in a region not dominated by resonances.",

The result, higher than expected from naive short-distance expectations, can be accommodated by models predicting strong, hadronic enhancements, although approaches based on NP models are also suggested. This outstanding result pushes further forward the study of other modes where effects of CP violation may be at a similar level. This is the case of three-and four-body Cabibbo-suppressed modes such D + \u2192 K \u2212 K + \u03c0 + , D + \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + and D 0 \u2192 K + K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + . From the beautiful lesson learnt from charmless B + decays, localised CP asymmetries in the phase space can be potentially larger than integrated ones.

Final-state interactions, fundamentally hadronic, are the carriers of this constraint: any observed CP violation in one mode should be compensated by other(s) mode(s) with the same quantum numbers and, in particular, flavour content. Although the concept is clear, its practical consequences are not obvious when the multiplicity of decay channels is large, which is the case of B decays. Yet, the experimental data, in general with a concentration near the edges of the Dalitz plot, may seem to indicate that CP T can be more useful than anticipated [268]. While quantitative statements are hard to make, the idea here is to use it to enlighten CP violation studies by trying to correlate different measurements or to search for new paths.",
