            "text": "This Letter describes measurements of inclusive W (\u2192 e\u03bd) + n jet cross sections (n =1-4), presented as total inclusive cross sections and differentially in the n th jet transverse momentum. The measurements are made using data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 4.2 fb \u22121 collected by the D0 detector at the Fermilab Tevatron Collider, and achieve considerably smaller uncertainties on W +jets production cross sections than previous measurements. The measurements are compared to next-to-leading order perturbative QCD (pQCD) calculations in the n =1-3 jet multiplicity bins and to leading order pQCD calculations in the 4-jet bin. The measurements are generally in agreement with pQCD calculations, although certain regions of phase space are identified where these predictions could better match the data. Measurements of vector boson plus jet production are fundamental tests of perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD), the theory describing the strong interaction. In addition to providing a test of pQCD at high momentum scales, W +jets production can be the dominant background in measurements of single top quark and tt production as well as in searches for the standard model Higgs boson and for physics beyond the standard model. Theoretical uncertainties on the production rates and kinematics introduce limitations in our ability to identify new physics signals. Therefore, it is crucial to make precision measurements of W +jets production at the Fermilab Tevatron Collider and the CERN Large Hadron Collider in order to constrain these backgrounds. We present new measurements of W +jets cross sections with a data sample more than ten times larger than that used in previous measurements [1], allowing the first detailed study of W + 4 jet production. The previous measurements have been used extensively in testing and tuning theoretical models of W boson production [2][3][4].",

These components are used primarily to identify the location of the pp interaction vertex and the electron produced in the decay of the W boson candidate.

Jets are identified with the D0 midpoint cone algorithm [9], which uses a cone of radius R = 0.5 (distance in \u03b7 \u2212\u03c6 space [10]) to cluster calorimeter cells. The electromagnetic fraction of the jet energy is required to be below 0.95 to reject electrons and above 0.05 to suppress jets dominated by noise. Jets with a large fraction of their energy deposited in the coarse hadronic layers of the calorimeter are also rejected due to noise typical in those layers. To minimize background from jet candidates arising from noise in the precision readout of the calorimeter, confirmation from the readout system of the first level trigger is required for reconstructed jets. Jets matched to loose electrons with p T > 20 GeV and \u2206R(e, jet) < 0.5 are also rejected. Jets are corrected for calorimeter response, instrumental and out-of-cone showering effects, and additional energy deposits in the calorimeter that arise from detector noise and pile-up from multiple interactions and different beam crossings. These jet energy scale corrections [11] are determined us-ing transverse momentum imbalance in \u03b3 + jet events, where the electromagnetic calorimeter response is calibrated using Z/\u03b3 * \u2192 e + e \u2212 events. Jets are required to have at least two tracks that point to their associated pp vertex. Energies of jets containing muons are corrected with the measured muon momentum after accounting for the typical energy deposited by a minimum ionizing particle. Jets are ordered in decreasing transverse momentum and we call the jet with the highest transverse momentum \"leading.\" Electrons are identified as clusters of calorimeter cells in which 95% of the energy in the shower is deposited in the electromagnetic (EM) section. The electron candidates must be isolated from other calorimeter energy deposits, have spatial distributions consistent with those expected for electron showers, and the event must contain a reconstructed track matched to the EM shower that is isolated from other tracks. Isolation from energy deposited by hadrons is imposed by requiring (E tot \u2212 E em )/E em < 0.15, where E tot (E em ) is the total (electromagnetic) energy in a cone of radius R = 0.4 (R = 0.2). Events with a second isolated electron (with p T > 15 GeV) are removed to suppress the background due to Z boson and Drell-Yan production. The missing transverse energy in the event is calculated as the vector sum of the calorimeter cell energies and is corrected for the presence of any muons. Because the longitudinal component of the momentum of the neutrino is not measured, the measured properties of the W boson candidates are limited to their transverse energy, E W T , and transverse mass, defined as",

We simulate the W/Z+jets and tt processes with alpgen [12] interfaced with pythia [13] for the simulation of initial and final state radiation and for parton hadronization. The pythia generator is used to simulate diboson production, while production of single top quarks is simulated with the comphep [14] generator interfaced with pythia. The cross sections for W/Z+jet production are taken from alpgen, corrected with a constant multiplicative factor to match the inclusive W/Z+jet cross sections calculated at NLO [15]. Additional corrections are applied to events containing W/Z bosons plus heavy flavor jets, to match the predictions of NLO QCD calculations. Events from randomly chosen beam crossings, with the same instantaneous luminosity profile as the data, are overlaid on the simulated events to reproduce the effect of multiple pp interactions and detector noise. All simulated samples are passed through the D0 detector simulation and then reconstructed in the same way as the data.

We determine the systematic uncertainty for all these sources apart from the latter two using the alpgen+pythia ensembles. The relevant variables in all events are varied within their systematic uncertainties, resulting in new signal templates and new migration matrices. The nominal ensembles (which look and behave as our reconstructed data distributions) are again unfolded but this time with inputs to guru replaced with the systematic-shifted samples As expected, it is found that the statistical uncertainties from the shifted residual distributions are largely insensitive to changes in the detector response, but the unfolding bias can vary significantly. The change in the bias from the nominal to shifted ensembles is attributed to the systematic uncertainty in the unfolded data distributions. All differential cross section measurements are normalized to the measured inclusive W boson cross section, resulting in a complete (partial) cancellation of the systematic uncertainties due to luminosity (trigger and electron identification efficiencies). The dominant uncertainties due to jet energy scale and jet energy resolution are correlated bin-to-bin (and between jet spectra), the uncertainties due to the jet-track matching requirement and electron identification efficiency are partially correlated. All other uncertainties are considered to be uncorrelated. The correlation of systematic uncertainties between jet multiplicity bins are taken into account when normalizing the differential cross section spectra and in determining the uncertainties on measurement of the \u03c3 n /\u03c3 n\u22121 inclusive cross section ratios.",

The mcfm calculations employ version 6.0 of the program. blackhat and rocket are parton level generators which incorporate NLO QCD calculations with up to 3 final state jets. They provide parton level jets corresponding to the hard partons, but they do not include the underlying event or hadronization effects.

For the Born and virtual loop diagrams, the only hard scale is M W , due to the single massless jet balancing the W boson. However, in the case of diagrams with an extra hard emission, the two final state partons can be combined into one massive jet by the jet reconstruction algorithm increasing the scale of the real contributions, which generally increase the cross section. As a result, the real diagrams are evaluated with a coupling that is smaller, due to the running of \u03b1 s , than the virtual diagrams, which leads to a prediction of the NLO cross section that is too low. Both theory calculations use the MSTW2008 parton density function (PDF) [25], where the LO (NLO) cross section calculation is matched to the LO (NLO) PDF.

The parton level cross sections are computed with the siscone jet finding algorithm, while the particle level predictions are computed with the D0 midpoint cone algorithm, in order to account for the difference in jet algorithm between the data and the pQCD predictions. The impact of folding the correction for the jet algorithm into the overall hadronization correction is small, and approximately an order of magnitude smaller than the theoretical scale uncertainties in size. All inclusive and differential pQCD predictions have the hadronization corrections applied to them. We provide the tables of the hadronization corrections [29] so that future pQCD calculations can be compared to the data on the same terms. The quoted uncertainty on these corrections is purely statistical. Fig. 1(a) shows the absolute inclusive W + n jet cross sections for each jet multiplicity considered, compared with the LO and NLO theoretical predictions from blackhat+sherpa and rocket+mcfm, where both are corrected for hadronization effects. Fig. 1(b) shows the ratio of theory to data. Good agreement is observed between data and the NLO theory predictions, except for the 1-jet bin, where the NLO prediction presents a slight excess with respect to the data. Fig. 1(c) shows the measurement of the \u03c3 n /\u03c3 n\u22121 inclusive cross section ratio as a function of inclusive jet multiplicity for n=1-4 in comparison to predictions of this ratio from LO and NLO calculations. Here, the theoretical uncertainty takes the correlations of the scale choice between the n and n \u2212 1 multiplicity bins into account. The data uncertainties are also calculated from the relative uncertainties on the two cross sections, but with partial or total cancellation of systematic uncertainties due to electron identification, trigger, and luminosity. The uncertainties due to the jet corrections are correlated between bins and are accounted for. The total uncertainties on the measurement presented throughout this paper are comparable to the scale uncertainties on the predictions at NLO. Tables of the measured and theoretical cross sections and their uncertainties are given in the appendix to this paper. The unfolded differential data cross sections (multiplied by the branching fraction of the W \u2192 e\u03bd decay) for each jet multiplicity are shown in Fig. 2. The data are normalized by the measured inclusive W boson cross section in all jet multiplicity bins, which reduces the uncertainties in the measurement because of cancellation of some systematic uncertainties. The data spectra are compared to the predictions from rocket+mcfm and blackhat+sherpa (again normalized by their respective inclusive W boson cross sections and corrected for hadronization effects). The theory is able to describe the data throughout the p jet T spectra for all multiplicities, although a detailed comparison is best made by examining the ratios of theory to data. Each data point is placed at the p T value where the theoretical differential cross section is equal to the average cross section within the bin [27].",

The region that defines the kinematic phase space of the measurement at particle level is given by the electron transverse momentum, p e T \u2265 15 GeV, and pseudorapidity |\u03b7 e | < 1.1, total transverse energy of all neutrinos E \u03bd T > 20 GeV, W transverse mass M W T > 40 GeV, jet transverse momentum p jet T \u2265 20 GeV and rapidity |y jet | < 3.2. W boson inclusive cross sections per jet multiplicity bin correspond to the sum over all p jet T in the given jet multiplicity, and the normalized cross sections are the absolute cross sections in a given jet multiplicity divided by the inclusive W boson cross sections in the entire kinematic region. The hadronization corrections can be applied as a multiplicative factor to parton level jets clustered using the siscone algorithm to produce particle jets, as defined by the D0 midpoint algorithm. Quoted systematic uncertainties on measured absolute cross-sections include a 6.1% luminosity uncertainty.            ",
