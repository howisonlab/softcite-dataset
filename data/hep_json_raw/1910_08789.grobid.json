Fourier harmonic decomposition is used to quantify these anisotropies. The higher-order harmonics can be induced by the same order anisotropies (linear response) or by the combined influence of several lower order anisotropies (nonlinear response) in the initial state. The mixed higherorder anisotropic flow and nonlinear response coefficients of charged particles are measured as functions of transverse momentum and centrality in PbPb collisions at nucleonnucleon center-of-mass energies \u221a s NN = 2.76 and 5.02 TeV with the CMS detector. The results are compared with viscous hydrodynamic calculations using several different initial conditions, as well as microscopic transport model calculations. None of the models provides a simultaneous description of the mixed higher-order flow harmonics and nonlinear response coefficients.",

The v n and \u03a8 n are the magnitude and phase (also known as the nth order symmetry plane angle) of V n , respectively. Anisotropic flow plays a major role in probing the properties of the produced medium in heavy ion collisions at the BNL RHIC [3][4][5][6] and CERN LHC [7][8][9]. Studies of flow harmonics higher than the second order [10][11][12], flow e-mail: cms-publication-committee-chair@cern.ch fluctuations [13][14][15][16], the correlation between the magnitude and phase of different harmonics [17][18][19][20][21][22][23][24], and the transverse momentum ( p T ) and pseudorapidity (\u03b7) dependence of symmetry plane angles [25,26], have led to a broader and deeper understanding of the initial conditions [3,27] and the properties of the produced hot and dense matter. There are significant correlations between the symmetry plane angles of different orders [20], which indicate that higher-order mixed harmonics can be studied with respect to multiple lowerorder symmetry plane angles.",

Each nonlinear response coefficient has its associated mixed harmonic, which is V n measured with respect to the lower-order symmetry plane angle or angles. The strength of each nonlinear response coefficient determines the magnitude of its associated mixed harmonic. The V 1 terms are neglected in the decomposition in Eq. (2) because the correlation between V n and V 1 V n\u22121 was shown to be negligible after correcting V 1 for global momentum conservation [28]. This analysis focuses on the terms that only involve the two largest anisotropic flow coefficients V 2 and V 3 on the right-hand side of Eq. 2. The procedures used to extract both mixed-harmonic and nonlinear response coefficients are given in Sect. 4. It is difficult to use measured v 2 and v 3 coefficients to evaluate hydrodynamic theories because these flow observables have a strong dependence on the initial anisotropies, which cannot be experimentally determined or tightly constrained. In contrast, most of the nonlinear response coefficients are not strongly sensitive to the initial anisotropies, which largely cancel in the dimensionless ratios used to determine these coefficients [1,28,31,32]. As a result, their experimental values can serve as unique and robust probes of hydrodynamic behavior of the QGP [31].",

            "text": "Most previous flow measurements focused on V n (overall flow), i.e., v n with respect to \u03a8 n , which does not separate the linear and nonlinear parts of Eq. 2. Direct measurements of the mixed higher-order flow harmonics, v 4 and v 6 with respect to \u03a8 2 , already exist at both RHIC [33] and LHC [11] energies, but were performed using the event plane method [34]. This method has been criticized for yielding an ambiguous measure lying somewhere between the event-averaged mean value v n and the root-mean-square value v 2 n of the v n distribution, depending on the resolution of the method [13,16,35]. This ambiguity can be removed by using the scalar-product method [35,36], which always measures the root-mean-square values of v n . The difference between the two methods is typically a few percent for v 2 , \u223c 10% for v 3 , and much larger for mixed harmonics [35]. This paper presents the mixed higher-order flow harmonics and nonlinear response coefficients for n = 4, 5, 6, and 7 using the scalar-product method. These variables are measured in PbPb collisions at nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energies \u221a s NN = 2.76 and 5.02 TeV, as functions of collision centrality and charged particle p T in the region |\u03b7| < 0.8. To compare the mixed flow harmonics with the overall flow coefficients, the higher-order flow harmonics with respect to the same-order symmetry plane, measured using the scalarproduct method, are also presented.",

            "text": "The central feature of the CMS apparatus is a superconducting solenoid of 6 m internal diameter, providing a nearly constant magnetic field of 3.8 T. Within the solenoid volume are a silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter, and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter, each composed of a barrel and two endcap sections. In this analysis, the tracker and the forward hadron (HF) calorimeter subsystems are of particular importance. The HF uses steel as an absorber and quartz fibers as the sensitive material. The two halves of the HF are located 11.2 m from the center of the interaction region, one on each end, and together they provide coverage in the range 3.0 < |\u03b7| < 5.2. These calorimeters are azimuthally subdivided into 20 \u2022 modular wedges and further segmented to form 0.175\u00d70.175 (\u0394\u03b7\u00d7\u0394\u03c6) \"towers\", where the angle \u03c6 is in radians. The silicon tracker measures charged particles within the range |\u03b7| < 2.5. It consists of 1440 silicon pixel and 15,148 silicon strip detector modules. For nonisolated particles of 1 < p T < 10 GeV/c and |\u03b7| < 1.4, the track resolutions are typically 1.5% in p T and 25-90 (45-150) \u00b5m in the transverse (longitudinal) impact parameter [37]. The Beam Pick-up Timing for the eXperiments (BPTX) devices are located around the beam pipe at a distance of 175 m from the interaction region on both sides, and are designed to provide precise information on the LHC bunch structure and timing of the incoming beams. A more detailed description of the CMS detector, together with a definition of the coordinate system used and the relevant kinematic variables, can be found in Ref. [38]. The Monte Carlo simulation of the particle propagation and detector response is based on the Geant4 [39] program.",

The minimum bias trigger [40] used in this analysis requires coincident signals in the HF calorimeters at both ends of the CMS detector with total energy deposits above a predefined energy threshold of approximately 1 GeV and the presence of both colliding bunches in the interaction region as determined using the BPTX. By requiring colliding bunches, events due to noise (e.g., cosmic rays and beam backgrounds) are largely suppressed. In the offline analysis, events are required to have at least one reconstructed primary vertex, which is chosen as the reconstructed vertex with the largest number of associated tracks. The primary vertex is formed by two or more associated tracks and is required to have a distance of less than 15 cm along the beam axis from the center of the nominal interaction region and less than 0.15 cm from the beam position in the transverse plane. An additional selection of hadronic collisions is applied by requiring at least three towers, each with total energy above 3 GeV in each of the two HF calorimeters. The average number of collisions per bunch crossing is less than 0.001 for the events used in this analysis, with a pileup fraction less than 0.05%, which has a negligible effect on the results. Events are classified using a centrality variable that is related to the degree of geometric overlap between the two colliding nuclei. Events with complete (no) overlap are denoted as centrality 0 (100)%, where the number is the fraction of events in a given class with respect to the total number of inelastic hadronic collisions. The centrality is determined offline via the sum of the HF energies in each event. Very central events (centrality approaching 0%) are characterized by a large energy deposit in the HF calorimeters. The results reported in this paper are presented up to 60% in centrality. The minimum bias trigger and event selections are fully efficient in this centrality range.",

The first iteration reconstructs tracks from signals (\"hits\") in the silicon pixel and strip detectors compatible with a trajectory of p T > 0.9 GeV/c. The significance of the separation along the beam axis (z) between the track and the primary vertex, d z /\u03c3 (d z ), and the significance of the impact parameter relative to the primary vertex transverse to the beam, d 0 /\u03c3 (d 0 ), must be less than 2. In addition, the relative uncertainty of the p T measurement, \u03c3 ( p T )/ p T , must be less than 5%, and tracks are required to have at least 11 out of the possible 14 hits along their trajectories in the pixel and strip trackers. To reduce the number of misidentified tracks, the chi-squared per degree of freedom, \u03c7 2 /dof, associated with fitting the track trajectory through the different pixel and strip layers, must be less than 0.15 times the total number of layers having hits along the trajectory of the track. The second iteration reconstructs tracks compatible with a trajectory of p T > 0.2 GeV/c using solely the pixel detector. These tracks are required to have d z /\u03c3 (d z ) < 6 and a fit \u03c7 2 /dof value less than 9 times the number of layers with hits along the trajectory of the track. In the final analysis, first iteration tracks with p T > 1.0 GeV/c are combined with pixel-detector-only tracks that have 0.2 < p T < 2.4 GeV/c. After removing duplicates [7], the merged track collection has a combined geometric acceptance and efficiency exceeding 60% for p T \u2248 1.0 GeV/c and |\u03b7| < 0.8, as determined using the hydjet event generator [42]. When the track p T is below 1 GeV/c, the acceptance and efficiency steadily drops, reaching approximately 40% at p T \u2248 0.3 GeV/c, which is the lower limit for p T in this analysis.",

It is observed that the odd harmonic coefficients \u03c7 523 and \u03c7 7223 are larger than those for the even harmonics for p T less than 3 GeV/c in the two explored centrality ranges. The values for the even harmonics first decrease slightly as p T increases, reach a minimum at p T about 2 GeV/c, and then slowly increase until appearing to plateau for p T above 4 GeV/c. The results are compared with viscous hydrodynamic predictions [30] at \u221a s NN = 2.76 TeV with \u03b7/s = 0.08 (where \u03b7/s is the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio of the hydrodynamic medium, and here \u03b7 denotes shear viscosity rather than pseudorapidity) and Glauber initial conditions in two centrality ranges (5-10% and 35-40%) which roughly match those of the data (0-20% and 20-60%). In the model, as p T increases from 0.3 to 1 GeV/c, the predicted coefficients increase for n = 4 and 5, but decrease and then increase for n = 6 and 7, with a much stronger p T dependence than the data. The strong p T dependence, attributed to the large variance of the flow angles \u03a8 n at small p T [30], is not observed in data for n = 4 and 5. Figure 4 shows the mixed higher-order flow harmonics, The model qualitatively describes v 5 {\u03a8 23 } in the 0-40% centrality range but underestimates the result for more peripheral collisions. For v 7 {\u03a8 223 }, the predicted values are much smaller than the data, especially for centrality from 35 to 50%.",

The results are compared with predictions at \u221a s NN = 2.76 TeV from the microscopic transport model AMPT [48,49], a macroscopic hydrodynamic model using a deformed symmetric Gaussian density profile as the initial conditions with \u03b7/s = 0.08 [1], and from another hydrodynamic calculation (iEBE-VISHNU) with both Glauber and Kharzeev-Levin-Nardi (KLN) gluon saturation initial conditions using the same \u03b7/s [28]. The model with Gaussian profile initial conditions gives a better description of the nonlinear response coefficients compared to other calculations, but it underestimates the values of v 7 {\u03a8 223 } for centrality above 30%, as shown in Fig. 4. In Fig. 6, the same results are compared with the predictions from hydrodynamics + hadronic cas-    [48] as well as hydrodynamics with a deformed symmetric Gaussian density profile as the initial conditions using \u03b7/s = 0.08 from Ref.

All the calculations describe the \u03c7 422 well, but none of them are successful for \u03c7 523 and \u03c7 7223 . The model calculations of \u03c7 7223 are quite different for various initial conditions and \u03b7/s, which suggests that the first-time measurement of \u03c7 7223 presented in this paper could provide strong constraints on models.",

The measurements use the scalar-product method, covering a p T range from 0.3 to 8.0 GeV/c, pseudorapidity |\u03b7| < 0.8, and a centrality range of 0-60%. The mixed higher-order flow harmonics, 6 {\u03a8 33 }, and v 7 {\u03a8 223 } all have a qualitatively similar p T dependence, first increasing at low p T , reaching a maximum at about 3-4 GeV/c, and then decreasing at higher p T . As a comparison, the overall v n harmonics (n = 4-7) with respect to their own symmetry planes are measured in the same p T , \u03b7, and centrality ranges. The relative contribution of the nonlinear part for v 5 is larger than for other harmonics in the centrality range 20-60%. In addition, the nonlinear response coefficients of the odd harmonics are observed to be Fig. 6 The same results as in Fig. 5 but compared with predictions from a hydrodynamics + hadronic cascade hybrid approach with the IP-Glasma initial conditions using \u03b7/s = 0.095 [50] at \u221a s NN = 5.02 TeV and from iEBE-VISHNU hydrodynamics with the KLN initial conditions using \u03b7/s = 0, 0.08 (the same curve as in larger than those of even harmonics for p T less than 3 GeV/c. At p T less than 1 GeV/c, a viscous hydrodynamic calculation with Glauber initial conditions and shear viscosity to entropy density ratio \u03b7/s = 0.08 predicts a much stronger p T dependence for the nonlinear response coefficients. The coefficients, including the first-time measurement of \u03c7 7223 , as a function of centrality, are compared with AMPT and hydrodynamic predictions using different \u03b7/s and initial conditions. Compared to the data, none of the models provides a simultaneous description of the mixed higher-order flow harmonics and nonlinear response coefficients.

For v 7 {\u03a8 223 }, the predicted values are much smaller than the data, especially for centrality from 35 to 50%.The nonlinear response coefficients, \u03c7 422 , \u03c7 523 , \u03c7 6222 , \u03c7 633 , and \u03c7 7223 are presented in Figs. 5 and 6, as a function of centrality in the p T range from 0.3 to 3.0 GeV/c. The results are compared with predictions at \u221a s NN = 2.76 TeV from the microscopic transport model AMPT[48,49], a macroscopic hydrodynamic model using a deformed symmetric Gaussian density profile as the initial conditions with \u03b7/s = 0.08[1], and from another hydrodynamic calculation (iEBE-VISHNU) with both Glauber and Kharzeev-Levin-Nardi (KLN) gluon saturation initial conditions using the same \u03b7/s[28]. The model with Gaussian profile initial conditions gives a better description of the nonlinear response coefficients compared to other calculations, but it underestimates the values of v 7 {\u03a8 223 } for centrality above 30%, as shown inFig. 4. InFig. 6, the same results are compared with the predictions from hydrodynamics + hadronic cas-",
