We analyze a sample of Tevatron pp collisions at \u221a s=1.96 TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 6.7 fb \u22121 recorded by the CDF II detector. In events with large missing transverse energy and one energetic jet, we find good agreement between the standard model prediction and the observed data. We set 90% confidence level upper limits on the dark matter production rate. The limits are translated into bounds on nucleon-dark matter scattering rates which are competitive with current direct detection bounds on spin-independent interaction below a dark matter candidate mass of 5 GeV/c 2 , and on spin-dependent interactions up to masses of 200 GeV/c 2 .",

This class of DM candidates appears in many models of new physics with interactions that allow for DM detection through WIMPnucleon scattering in direct detection experiments [2].",

We consider several models of DM production that are relevant for direct detection experiments. We assume \u03c7 is a Dirac fermion [13], and that production is mediated by a massive state which couples to DM and SM quarks. For this analysis, we consider three models of dark matter production which consist of vector (O V ), axial-vector (O AV ), and t-channel operators (O t ) as defined in [6,7]. A universal sum over all quark flavors is assumed for these operators. In direct detection experiments, the vector operator leads to spin-independent DM scattering, while the axial vector operator is spindependent. The t-channel operator includes both spindependent and spin-independent terms. By considering the three types of operators, we are able to constrain both spin-independent and spin-dependent DM-nucleon scattering cross sections.",

As the momentum transfer in DM scattering is far lower than the mass of the particle mediating the interaction, an effective theory provides a valid description. In a collider environment, with large momentum transfers, the effective theory approach is not necessarily valid and may change the predicted crosssection and kinematics of the DM model [6,7,14]. We thus consider two possibilities: (1) that these contact interactions are also a good description of collider DM production, and (2) that the production of DM at the Tevatron proceeds through the exchange of a new particle. The new mediator particles which lead to the operators O V , O AV , and O t , are a heavy vector, axial-vector, and a scalar \"squark\" respectively. When constraining case 1 we implement models of DM production with very heavy mediators, well above the Tevatron reach (at 10 TeV), while for case 2 we consider light mediators, within the kinematic reach of the Tevatron (100 GeV/c 2 for O V and O AV and 400 GeV/c 2 for O t ).",

Events meeting this relaxed selection constitute the derivation sample. To maintain exclusivity, we remove all events entering the analysis sample from the derivation sample. In addition, we denote the probability that a given event originated in a multijet process as the multijet probability (MJP). This probability is taken as the fraction of events in the derivation sample that is unaccounted for by simulated backgrounds. The MJP is parameterized in six observables: E T , the number of jets, the minimum separation in azimuthal angle between E T and a jet, the ratio of the scalar sum of jet E T to its sum with the E T , the magnitude of the momentum imbalance from tracks with p T \u2265 10 GeV/c, and the E T significance [31].",

In the analysis sample, we observe 52633 events which agrees well with the expectation of 53906 \u00b1 6022. As we do not observe a significant excess over the number of events predicted by our background model, we proceed to quantify the maximum allowed DM production cross section. We set limits on the DM production rate using a Bayesian likelihood [33] formed as a product of likelihoods over bins in the analysis region of the jet E T distribution. We assume a flat prior on the signal rate, and a Gaussian prior for each systematic uncertainty including those affecting sample normalizations and shapes. We set Bayesian 90% confidence level upper limits on \u03c3(pp \u2192 \u03c7\u03c7 + jet) for each of the models considered. The expected upper limits at each model point are derived by randomly generating a series of pseudo-datasets, derived from the background prediction, and computing the median of the distribution of resulting upper limits. The upper limits are listed in Table II. We proceed to convert the limits into constraints on the DM-nucleon cross section following [6,8]. A comparison of the CDF limits to several direct detection results is shown in Fig. 2. The CDF limits assuming light mediators are also shown. The CDF bounds extend beyond the experimental reach of direct detection searches, which are insensitive to DM with a mass of approximately 1 GeV/c 2 . For a DM mass of 5 GeV/c 2 , CDF bounds on spin-independent interactions are O(10 \u221238 ) cm 2 and are similar to the limits reported by the DAMIC [34] collaboration. In the case of spin-dependent interactions, we report stronger bounds of O(10 \u221240 ) cm 2 for a DM mass of 1 GeV/c 2 , rising to O(10 \u221239 ) cm 2 for a mass of 200 GeV/c 2 .",
