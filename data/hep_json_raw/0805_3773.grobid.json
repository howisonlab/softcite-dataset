The branching fraction obtained is (25.24 \u00b1 0.01 \u00b1 0.39)%, where the first error is statistical and the second is systematic. The unfolded \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 mass spectrum is used to determine resonance parameters for the \u03c1(770), \u03c1 \u2032 (1450), and \u03c1 \u2032\u2032 (1700) mesons. We also use this spectrum to estimate the hadronic (2\u03c0) contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon (a \u03c0\u03c0 \u00b5 ). Our result for a \u03c0\u03c0 \u00b5 integrated over the mass range \u221a s = 2m \u03c0 \u2212 1.8 GeV/c 2 is a \u03c0\u03c0 \u00b5 = (523.5 \u00b1 1.5 (exp) \u00b1 2.6 (Br) \u00b1 2.5 (isospin)) \u00d7 10 \u221210 , where the first error is due to the experimental uncertainties, the second is due to the uncertainties in the branching fractions and the third is due to the uncertainties in the isospin-violating corrections.",

            "text": "From the conservation of vector current (CVC) theorem, the \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 mass spectrum in this range can be related to the cross section for the process e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and thus used to improve the theoretical error on the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon a \u00b5 = (g \u00b5 \u2212 2)/2. Recent reviews of calculations of a \u00b5 are given in Refs. [2,3,4]. It is known that the theoretical error on a \u00b5 is dominated by the contribution from the leadingorder hadronic vacuum polarization a had,LO \u00b5 . This contribution cannot be derived within the framework of perturbative QCD and is usually evaluated using dispersion relations and the experimental cross section for e + e \u2212 annihilation to hadrons [5,6,7,8]. Alternatively, CVC relates the properties of the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 system produced in e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 to those of the \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 system produced in \u03c4 \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 \u03bd \u03c4 decay; thus, using CVC and correcting for isospin-violating effects, \u03c4 data have also been used to obtain a more precise prediction for a had,LO \u00b5 [5,6,8,9]. Recently, new precise data on e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 have become available from the CMD-2, KLOE, and SND experiments [10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17]. ALEPH [18,19], CLEO [20,21], and OPAL [22,23] measured both the 2\u03c0 spectral function and the branching fraction for the \u03c4 \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 \u03bd \u03c4 decay; the latter was also determined by L3 [24] and DELPHI [25]. Recent evaluations of the hadronic contribution to a \u00b5 using e + e \u2212 data result in a exp \u00b5 \u2212 a th \u00b5 = (27.5 \u00b1 8.4) \u00d7 10 \u221210 [26,27], while that using the \u03c4 lepton data where applicable gives a exp \u00b5 \u2212 a th \u00b5 = (9.4 \u00b1 10.5) \u00d7 10 \u221210 [5], where the experimental value a exp \u00b5 is dominated by the BNL E821 measurement [28] (11 659 208.0 \u00b1 6.3) \u00d7 10 \u221210 . These differences correspond to 3.3 and 0.9 standard deviations, respectively. For the evaluation based on the e + e \u2212 data, a deviation of similar size that corresponds to a 3.4 \u03c3 discrepancy is claimed in Ref. [29]. To clarify these differences between the e + e \u2212 -based and \u03c4 -based predictions, more data on e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + and \u03c4 \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 \u03bd \u03c4 decays are needed. In this paper we present a highstatistics measurement of the \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 mass spectrum produced in \u03c4 \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 \u03bd \u03c4 decays using data collected with the Belle experiment at the KEKB asymmetric-energy e + e \u2212 collider operating at a center-of-mass (CM) energy of 10.6 GeV. The data sample is about 50 times larger than those of previous experiments.",

It is based on an integrated luminosity of 72.2 fb \u22121 recorded at a CM energy of 10.58 GeV. The Belle detector is a large-solid-angle magnetic spectrometer consisting of several detector components. Charged track coordinates near the collision point are measured by a three-layer silicon-vertex detector (SVD) that surrounds a 2 cm radius beryllium beam pipe. Track trajectory coordinates are reconstructed in a 50-layer central drift chamber (CDC), and momentum measurements are made together with the SVD. An array of 1188 silica-aerogel Cherenkov counters (ACC), a barrel-like arrangement of time-offlight scintillation counters (TOF), and specific ionization measurements (dE/dx) in the CDC provide a capability for the identification of charged particles. Photon detection and energy measurement of the photons and electrons are provided by an electromagnetic calorimeter (ECL) consisting of an array of 8736 CsI(Tl) crystals all pointing toward the interaction point. These detector components are located in a magnetic field of 1.5 T provided by a superconducting solenoid. An iron flux-return located outside the coil is instrumented to identify muons and to detect K 0 L mesons (KLM). A comprehensive description of the detector is given in Ref. [36].",

The cross section for e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 (\u03b3) is also updated to the recent measurement reported in Ref. [41]. The radiative corrections to the \u03c4 -hadronic decays are simulated by the PHOTOS program [42]. The QQ generator [43] is used forBB andqq continuum processes, the BHLUMI [44] program for radiative Bhabha events, the KKMC [37] program for radiative \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 -pair events, and the AAFH [45] program for two-photon processes. The BHLUMI and KKMC programs include higher-order radiative corrections and are among the most accurate programs available. The detector response is simulated by a GEANT3based program [46]. In order to simulate beam-induced background realistically, detector hits taken from randomly triggered data are added to wire hits in the CDC and to energy deposits in the ECL. Uncertainties due to imperfections in the Monte Carlo generators and detector simulation are discussed in the later sections.",

In this expression p in is the fourmomentum of the initial e + e \u2212 system, while p tr and p \u03b3 are the sum of the momenta of measured tracks and photons, respectively. A pion mass is assumed for the charged tracks if they are not identified as electrons or muons. Each photon (reconstructed from clusters in the calorimeter) must be separated from the nearest track projection by at least 20 cm and have an energy greater than 0.05 GeV in the barrel region (\u22120.63 \u2264 cos \u03b8 < 0.85), and greater than 0.1 GeV in the endcap region (\u22120.90 \u2264 cos \u03b8 < \u22120.62 and 0.85 \u2264 cos \u03b8 < 0.95).

Projections for the six slices are shown in Fig. 3, where each process shows a characteristic shape: the \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 candidates dominate in the central region in M miss and \u03b8 * miss . Both Bhabha and \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 show a prominent peak at M miss \u2248 0, but the width for the Bhabha is slightly wider than that of \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 . We use the events in the region |M miss | < 0.5 GeV/c 2 to determine the normalization for the Bhabha and \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 . As two-photon processes dominate in the high-M miss region, the normalization for the two-photon processes is determined using the events at |M miss | > 8.0 GeV/c 2 . The arrows with solid (dotted) lines indicate the narrowest (widest) areas used to select \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 -pairs by the octagonal selection. Although overall features of the data are modeled reasonably well by MC, some discrepancies are seen, for example, in the regions M miss \u2248 0 and > 6 GeV/c 2 in Fig 4-(c), which are taken into account as the systematic error on the background estimation.  Candidate events are divided into two hemispheres in the CM frame by the plane perpendicular to the highest momentum particle, and the remaining background from e + e \u2212 annihilation is suppressed by selecting events with low multiplicity as characterized by the quantity X part \u2261 (n tr + n \u03b3 ) 1 \u00d7 (n tr + n \u03b3 ) 2 , where n tr,j and n \u03b3,j are the numbers of tracks and photons in hemisphere j.

In this formula, several common uncertainties such as that on the luminosity, on the cross section for \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212pair production, on the trigger efficiency, and on the \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 selection efficiency cancel in the ratio.

The uncertainty on the tracking efficiency is estimated using D * + \u2192 D 0 \u03c0 + \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + decays to be 1% per track. A large part of this uncertainty cancels in the ratio of Eq. 8; the resulting relative uncertainty from this source is \u2206B/B = 0.47 %. The systematic error on the \u03c0 0 detection efficiency has two components: one is the uncertainty coming from the \u03c0 0 selection criteria and the other is that from the absolute efficiency calibration. For the uncertainty coming from the \u03c0 0 selection, we check the uncertainty by changing the definition of the signal and background region, by taking into account the uncertainty in the resolution function and by changing the \u03c0 0 threshold momentum. For example, the relative branching fraction changes by only \u2206B/B = 0.1% if the signal region is changed from the nominal one to \u22127 < S \u03b3\u03b3 < 7.

However, this veto can reject signal itself if photons are radiated in the initial or final state and those photons are detected within the detector fiducial volume. In addition, photon candidates can also appear due to electromagnetic shower fragments and/or misreconstructed electrons. Therefore a precise simulation of the photon radiation as well as the shower simulation are important. The uncertainty from these sources is estimated by changing the veto threshold by \u00b10.1 GeV around the nominal value of 0.2 GeV; the resulting relative change in B h\u03c0 0 is only \u00b10.20%. Signal events are flagged by several trigger conditions that require two or more CDC tracks with associated TOF hits, ECL clusters, or a significant sum of energy in the ECL. This redundancy allows one to monitor the efficiency of each trigger requirement. The uncertainty arising from the trigger is estimated by assuming that there is a \u00b13% uncertainty on the track and energy trigger efficiencies, which is the maximum variation measured during experimental running. The resulting relative uncertainty is small (0.32%) since the \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 trigger efficiency is high (97%).",

Figure 12 shows a more detailed comparison, the difference in |F \u03c0 (s)| 2 of Belle and CLEO, ALEPH data for the fit of the Belle data divided by the fit value, for the mass-squared range 0.11-1.20 (GeV/c 2 ) 2 . It can be seen that over the entire mass range shown, the |F \u03c0 (s)| 2 values from Belle are consistent within errors with those of CLEO. Agreement is worse when Belle data are compared to ALEPH data.

The difference between the resummed value (1.01907) and the lowest-order estimate (1.01878) is taken as the error on S EW and the resummed S EW value is used throughout this paper. The shift of a \u03c0\u03c0 \u00b5 from this correction is \u25b3a \u03c0\u03c0 \u00b5 = (12.0 \u00b1 0.2) \u00d7 10 \u221210 . Note that this correction is already applied in Eq. (7) and the pion form factor given in Table VI. (ii) The long-distance QED radiative correction G EM (s) was computed in the framework of chiral perturbation theory by Cirigliano et al. in Ref. [30] . Recently, it was reevaluated based on a meson dominance model by Flores-Tlalpa et al. in Ref. [53]. It is found that the predictions of both models coincide if the contribution of the \u03c9(782) intermediate state \u03c4 \u2192 \u03c9\u03c0 \u2212 \u03bd \u03c4 (\u03c9 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03b3), is excluded in the latter model calculation. Since in our data this intermediate \u03c9(782) contribution is already subtracted at the analysis level, we use the s-dependent correction factor provided by Flores-Tlalpa, which does not include the \u03c9 contribution. This correction produces a shift of \u25b3a \u03c0\u03c0 \u00b5 = \u22121.0 \u00d7 10 \u221210 ,",
