The top quark was first observed via tt production at the Tevatron [1,2]. This was followed by the observation of single top-quark production [3][4][5] in the tand s-channels, also at the Tevatron. The associated tW produc tion was first observed in 8 TeV proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) [6,7]. These single-top-quark channels allow a direct determination of the dominant tWb vertex and of the magnitude of the CKM matrix element | Vtb | [8] using their measured cross-sections.",

Events are consid ered if they were accepted by at least one of the single-muon or single-electron triggers [17,18]. The electron triggers select a clus ter in the calorimeter matched to a track. Electrons must then satisfy identification criteria based on a multivariate technique us ing a likelihood discriminant. In 2015, electrons had to satisfy a 'medium' identification requirement and have a transverse energy of Et > 24 GeV. In 2016, electrons had to satisfy a 'tight' identifi cation together with an isolation criterion and have ET > 26 GeV. To avoid efficiency loss due to isolation at high E T, an additional trigger was used, selecting 'medium' electrons with ET > 60 GeV. Muons are triggered on by matching tracks reconstructed in the muon spectrometer and in the inner detector. In 2015, muons had to satisfy a 'loose' isolation requirement and have a transverse mo mentum of pT > 20 GeV.

The parton shower and the hadronisation of signal events were simulated with Pythia 6 [25] using the Perugia2012 set of tuned parameters [26]. The tZq total cross-section, calculated at next-to-leading order (NLO) using MG5_aMC@NLO 2.3.3 with the NNPDF3.0_nlo_as_0118 [27] PDF, is 800fb, with an uncertainty of \u00b16'4%. The uncertainty is computed by varying the renormalisation and factorisation scales by a factor of two and by a factor of 0.5. A comparison of the event kinematics before parton showering between the LO MG5_aMC@NLO 2.2.1 sample and a sample gen erated using NLO MG5_aMC@NLO 2.3.3 showed agreement within 10%, justifying the use of a LO sample for the detector simulation.",

Studies in the diboson VR indicated that the number of events predicted by the Sherpa MC samples is lower than the number observed. The kinematic distri butions are otherwise well described. Hence, the total number of diboson events predicted by the Sherpa samples is scaled by a fac tor of 1.47, leading to an expected number of diboson events in the SR of 53. The scale factor is derived from the diboson CR, defined in Section 5, by computing the data-to-MC ratio for events that satisfy the condition mT (W) > 60 GeV. This selection is applied in order to reduce the Z + jets contamination and ensure a dibosondominated region. The uncertainty in the scale factor is estimated by varying the requirement for the mT(W) selection. An additional uncertainty in the diboson estimate is assigned by evaluating the difference in the number of events in the signal region when using the default Sherpa samples and a set of Powheg samples. This re sults in an estimated uncertainty of 30%, also taking into account the extrapolation of the scale factor from the CR to the SR.",

Requiring a pair of opposite sign, different-flavour leptons, and rejecting events with an OSSF pair, ensures that there is no contamination from Z + jets events and from the SR. Different electron-muon invariant mass windows around the Z mass, with widths ranging from 20 GeV to 60 GeV, were investigated and the average of the obtained factors is used for scaling the ttt background in the signal region. The total un certainty in the scaling factor is calculated taking into account this variation and the statistical uncertainty of the sample. This leads to a data/MC scale factor of 1.21 \u00b1 0.51. Deriving separate factors de pending on the fake lepton's flavour or on the lepton pT was also investigated. All approaches are consistent with each other within the assigned uncertainties.
