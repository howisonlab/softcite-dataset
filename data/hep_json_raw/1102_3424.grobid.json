Recent CLEO-c studies include: (1) measurements of the branching fractions of \u03c7 cJ \u2192 pp\u03c0 0 , pp\u03b7, and pp\u03c9 1 ; (2) studies of \u03c8(2S) decays to \u03b3pp, pp\u03c0 0 , and pp\u03b7 and a confirmation of the BESII observation of the X(1870), a pp threshold enhancement in J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3pp 2 ; (3) a search for the radiative transition \u03c8(2S) \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7 c (2S) 3 ; (4) measurements of the higher order multipoles in the radiative transitions \u03c8(2S) \u2192 \u03b3\u03c7 c1,2 and \u03c7 c1,2 \u2192 \u03b3J/\u03c8 4 ; and (5) the discovery of the process e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 h c at a center of mass energy of 4170 MeV (preliminary).

These results are important inputs to predictions of the related charmonium production rates (pp \u2192 (cc) + X, where X is a hadron) that will be studied by the PANDA experiment at GSI. In addition, the Dalitz plots of \u03c7 c0,1 \u2192 pp\u03c0 0 have been studied (Figure 1). An enhancement in pp mass appears, which is inconsistent with both predictions from the meson emission model 5 and the X(1870) threshold enhancement 6 .",
