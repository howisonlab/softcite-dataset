Accurate modeling of neutrino interactions requires additional experimental observables such as the Adler angles which carry information about the polarization of the \u2206 resonance and the interference with non-resonant single pion production. The Adler angles were measured with limited statistics in bubble chamber neutrino experiments as well as in electron-proton scattering experiments. We discuss the viability of measuring these angles in neutrino interactions with nuclei.",

            "text": "The next generation of Long Base Line (LBL) accelerator neutrino oscillation experiments 1,2 aims at the discovery of CP violation in the lepton sector and the determination of the neutrino mass hierarchy. Systematic errors are likely to limit the accuracy of these measurements because the energy region of this new generation of experiments, ranging from 0.5 to 10 GeV, is dominated by several poorly measured crosssection channels: charged and neutral current quasi-elastic scattering, single-pion production, multi-pion resonant production and collective nuclear responses such as short and a) fsanchez@ifae.es long range nuclear correlations 3 . Additional challenges are our incomplete understanding of the nuclear effects contributing to the cross-section and inaccuracies in reconstructing the neutrino energy. In neutrino oscillation experiments, accurate measurements of oscillation parameters demand that uncertainties arising from the errors on neutrino fluxes and from the neutrino interactions themselves be properly factorized. In turn, this requires the correct modeling of neutrino-nucleus cross sections channels. Neutrino cross-section knowledge suffers from three levels of uncertainties: i) Cross-sections at the nucleon level are not perfectly known. Vector form factors are derived from electron scattering, 1 arXiv:1511.00501v2 [hep-ex] 28 Apr 2016 but axial and pseudoscalar form factors are assumed to be dipolar and constrained by the PCAC hypothesis. ii) Cross-sections are modified by effects due to the nuclear medium through short-and long-range correlations and by uncertainties in nucleon kinematics inside the nucleus. iii) The particles produced in the primary interaction cross the high-density nuclear medium which alters the particle composition of the event. Experimentally, the picture is confused even further by the typically broad neutrino energy spectrum and by beam flux uncertainties. During the last decade efforts were focused on the description and measurement of quasielastic scattering; however we now also need to accurately model interactions occurring at higher energies such as single pion production. These data are sparse and contradictory even at the nucleon level 4 . In addition, current and future measurements can be performed only on nuclei. In this paper, we explore the possibility of measuring Adler angles 5 in neutrino chargedcurrent pion production on nuclei. A full description of the theoretical implications of Adler angles measurements can be found in the references 6 . Experimental results from electron scattering on hydrogen have been published by the CLAS 7,8 collaboration and previously by earlier experiments 9 . These results were ob-tained on hydrogen targets, thereby avoiding initial and final state nuclear interactions and with the advantage of knowing the initial electron kinematics. Here, we discuss the possibility of measuring these angles in modern neutrino experiments, which are typically performed in broad-band beams and using heavy nuclear targets. In these experiments the neutrino energy must be reconstructed from the data, the initial target nucleon is not at rest and the final state particles undergo nuclear re-scattering. This work is based on the NEUT 10 Monte Carlo model, described in the following section. The angular observables are illustrated next, followed by Monte Carlo results and conclusions. II. MONTE CARLO MODEL Neutrino interactions are simulated with the NEUT 10 program libraries, which include neutral current (NC) and charged current (CC) processes of elastic and quasi-elastic scattering, meson exchange currents, single meson production, single gamma production, coherent pion production and non-resonant inelastic scattering. NEUT uses the Rein-Sehgal 11 model to simulate neutrino-induced single pion production and an ad-hoc model for multiple pion production up to a hadronic invariant mass of 2.0 GeV/c 2 . NEUT also includes a contribution from non-resonant pion production and the \u2206 polarization values measured in deuterium 12 . Final State Interactions (FSI) of hadrons taking place within the nuclear medium are also simulated using a microscopic cascade model. In the case of final state pions, the considered processes are inelastic scattering, pion absorption and charge exchange. The simulated nucleon interactions are elastic scattering as well as single and double \u2206 production. FSI interactions alter both the multiplicity of pions in the final state as well as the kinematics of the pions. For the current evaluation, events are generated with a T2K neutrino spectrum 13 . The simulation includes all channels present in the NEUT Monte Carlo. Most current experiments measure neutrino cross-sections on carbon-based detectors, such as plastic scintillator (Polystyrene). To avoid confusion between hydrogen and carbon targets, we decided to study interactions on carbon nuclei.",
