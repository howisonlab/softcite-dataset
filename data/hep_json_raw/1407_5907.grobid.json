Similar studies have been conducted for the baryonic final states B \u00fe \u2192 ppK \u00fe and B \u00fe \u2192 pp\u03c0 \u00fe [6]. In the B \u00fe \u2192 h \u00fe h \u2212 h \u00fe decays (h \u00bc \u03c0 or K throughout this Letter), large asymmetries, not necessarily associated to resonances, have been observed in the low K \u00fe K \u2212 and \u03c0 \u00fe \u03c0 \u2212 mass regions. These observations suggest that rescattering between \u03c0 \u00fe \u03c0 \u2212 and K \u00fe K \u2212 pairs may play an important role in the generation of the strong phase difference needed for CP violation to occur [7].

The momentum, vertex, and flight distance of the B \u00fe candidate are exploited, and track fit quality criteria, impact parameter, and momentum information of final-state particles are also used.
