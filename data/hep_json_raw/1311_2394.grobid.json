We present measurements of di-hadron correlations in azimuth angle and pseudorapidity in Pb-Pb collisions at \u221a s NN = 2.76 TeV and photonhadron correlations in pp collisions at \u221a s = 7 TeV with the ALICE detector, respectively. In di-hadron correlations, the near-side jet shape in the short-range correlation region is quantitatively analyzed at p T,trig < 8 GeV/c, and the modification of jet-particle yield, I AA and I CP , is measured at 8 < p T,trig < 15 GeV/c. In photon-hadron correlations, isolated leading photon and associated hadrons in its opposite azimuthal direction correlations are used to estimate the jet fragmentation function via the imbalance parameter, x",

            "text": "The research objective of ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions is to explore the properties of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP), a deconfined state of quarks and gluons. Many experimental and theoretical studies of the QGP have been obtained from the study of hadron jets, the fragmentation products of high transverse momentum (p T ) partons. [1][2][3][4][5] It is generally accepted that prior to hadronization, partons lose energy in the extreme hot and dense medium due to gluon radiation and multiple collisions. These phenomena are broadly known as \"jet quenching\". [6][7][8] At the LHC, the strong jet quenching in central heavy-ion collisions has been reported by ALICE, ATLAS and CMS collaborations. [9][10][11] The nuclear suppression factor R AA , which quantifies the suppression of charged hadrons, in central Pb-Pb collisions at \u221a s NN = 2.76 TeV is about 0.14 at p T \u223c 7 GeV/c. 9,11 Furthermore, a strong di-jet energy asymmetry for leading jet transverse momenta above 100 GeV/c has been reported. 12,13 At low transverse momenta (p T,jet < 50 GeV/c), background fluctuations due to the underlying event dominate 14 and event-by-event jet reconstruction becomes difficult. Two-particle correlations allow the study of medium effects on the jet fragmentation without the need for jet reconstruction.",

            "text": "Especially, direct photon-hadron correlations offer two major advantages as compared to di-jet measurements because of the nature of the photon. First, in contrast to partons, photons do not carry color charge and hence do not interact strongly when traversing the medium. 15 Second, the direct photon production at leading order (LO) in pp and A+A collisions is dominated by the QCD compton scattering process, q + g \u2192 q + \u03b3 and q + q \u2192 g + \u03b3 annihilation process, and the photon momentum in the center-of-mass frame is exactly balanced by that of the recoil parton. For these reasons, direct photon-hadron correlations have been considered as a \"golden channel\" for studying the properties of parton energy loss including parton fragmentation function without the need of the jet reconstruction. 16,17 Furthermore, significant measurements about parton energy loss in the medium by isolated photon-jet correlations at CMS are presented in Ref. 18. This proceeding is organized as follows: Sec. 2 briefly presents the ALICE detector relevant to this analysis and data sample. Section 3 shows the method of twoparticle correlations. The near-side jet shape analysis is discussed in Sec. 3.1 and the modification factor of jet-particle yield is discussed in Sec. 3.2. Section 3.3 has the discussion of fragmentation function estimation from isolated photon-hadron correlations. Section 4 summarizes the results from this proceeding.",

The collision vertex finding and tracking are performed using information from the Inner Tracking System (ITS) and the Time Projection Chamber (TPC). The ITS consists of six layers equipped with Slicon Pixel Detector (SPD), Silicon Drift Detector (SDD) and Silicon Strip Detector (SSD). The TPC is a cylindrical drift detector with uniform acceptance in azimuth angle (\u03c6) and a pseudorapidity coverage of |\u03b7| < 0.9. The reconstructed vertex information is used to select primary track candidates and constrain the p T of the track. The forward scintillators (VZERO) determine the centrality of the Pb-Pb collisions. Details can be found in Ref. 20. The photon is detected using the electromagnetic calorimeter (EMCal) which is a Pb-Scintillator sampling calorimeter covering \u0394\u03c6 = 100 \u2022 in the azimuthal angle and |\u03b7| < 0.7 in pseudorapidity.

The fraction is reduced about 80% by applied isolation criteria. In this analysis, the isolation criteria requires no particles including charged and neutral particles with p T > 0.5 GeV/c in a cone of radius R = \u0394\u03c6 2 + \u0394\u03b7 2 = 0.4 around a photon candidate with largest p T in one event. The right panel in Fig. 5 presents the x E distribution from isolated cluster (photon candidate)-hadron correlations with isolated leading cluster p T at 8 < p T,trig < 12 GeV/c (black), 12 < p T,trig < 16 GeV/c (red), and 16 < p T,trig < 25 GeV/c (blue). Two decay photons from high p T \u03c0 0 are generally close and their two electromagnetic showers overlapping in the calorimeter cells are clustered one cluster. A fraction of the clusters rejected unsuccessfully by photon identification cuts are the dominant contamination of isolated photons.  In order to subtract the contamination, the x E distribution of isolated \u03c0 0 -hadron correlations is measured, see the left panel in Fig. 6. Compared to inclusive \u03c0 0 , the isolated \u03c0 0 equally carries a large fraction of its parent parton energy from 0.5 to 0.8. An exponential slope is extracted from fitting the x E distribution of isolated \u03c0 0 -hadron correlations and compared to DSS fragmentation functions shown in the right panel in Fig. 6. The comparison indicates that the isolated \u03c0 0 is a parton fragmentation product and p \u03c0 0 T < p parton T . To subtract the contamination contribution to the x E distribution, the isolated photon purity is estimated firstly by two-component binned likelihood method: a mix of scaled signal and contamination distribution is used to fit all clusters in pp collision data at shower shape long axis \u03bb 2 0 distribution, see the left panel in Fig. 7. Here, the signal component is obtained from \u03b3-jet events generated with PYTHIA and propagated through the detectors with GEANT3, and the contamination component is extracted from data by selecting events which have failed the isolation criteria. The typical purity values obtained from this method in 8 < p T < 25 GeV/c increase from about 5% to 70%. The x E distribution of isolated \u03c0 0 -hadron correlations scaled with respect to the isolated photon purity estimated previous is subtracted from isolated cluster-hadron correlations. In the meanwhile, the underlying events x E contributions which are estimated at two different regions \u03c0 3 < \u0394\u03c6 < 2\u03c0 3 and 4\u03c0 3 < \u0394\u03c6 < 5\u03c0 3 are also removed from the isolated cluster-hadron correlations. The x E distribution of isolated photon-hadron correlations is shown in the right panel in Fig. 7, and a slope 7.8 \u00b1 0.9 is obtained from the fitting of x E distribution at 0. ",

In di-hadron correlations, the medium effect on the near-side jet peak is quantified at transverse momenta below 10 GeV/c. A broadening at lower p T intervals of trigger and associated particles and in more central Pb-Pb collisions is observed. The near-side peaks show a significant increase in \u0394\u03b7 moving from pp to central Pb-Pb collisions and no centrality dependence in \u0394\u03c6 within errors. This might be an indication of interaction of jets with longitudinal flow. At higher p T , the modification factors I AA and I CP of the jet-particle yield show a strong suppression on the away-side consistent with strong medium energy loss as well as an interesting near-side enhancement by effect of medium at the LHC.
