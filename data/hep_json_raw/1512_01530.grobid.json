The data are also compared to a Monte Carlo simulation of Standard Model angular distributions derived from the rapidity of the two jets. No evidence of anomalous phenomena is observed in the data, which are used to exclude, at 95% CL, quantum black holes with threshold masses below 8.3 TeV, 8.1 TeV, or 5.1 TeV in three different benchmark scenarios; resonance masses below 5.2 TeV for excited quarks, 2.6 TeV in a W model, a range of masses starting from m Z = 1.5 TeV and couplings from g q = 0.2 in a Z model; and contact interactions with a compositeness scale below 12.0 TeV and 17.5 TeV respectively for destructive and constructive interference between the new interaction and QCD processes. These results significantly extend the ATLAS limits obtained from 8 TeV data. Gaussian-shaped contributions to the mass distribution are also excluded if the effective cross-section exceeds values ranging from approximately 50-300 fb for masses below 2 TeV to 2-20 fb for masses above 4 TeV.",

New particles produced in LHC collisions must interact with the constituent partons of the proton. Consequently, the new particles can also produce partons in the final state. Final states including partons often dominate in models of new phenomena beyond the Standard Model (BSM). The partons shower and hadronize, creating collimated jets of particles carrying approximately the fourmomenta of the partons. The total production rates for two-jet (dijet) BSM signals can be large, allowing searches for anomalous dijet production to test for such signals with a relatively small data sample, even at masses that constitute significant fractions of the total hadron collision energy.",

Far above the confinement scale of QCD (\u22481 GeV), jets emerge from collisions with large transverse E-mail address: atlas.publications@cern.ch. momenta, p T , perpendicular to the direction of the incident partons. For the data analysed here, QCD predicts a smoothly falling dijet invariant mass distribution, m jj . New states decaying to two jets may introduce localized excesses in this distribution. In QCD, due to t-channel poles in the cross-sections for the dominant scattering processes, most dijet production occurs at small angles \u03b8 * , defined as the polar angle in the dijet centre-of-mass frame. 1 Many theories of BSM physics predict additional dijet production with a significant population of jets produced at large angles with respect to the beam; for reviews see Refs. [1,2]. The search reported in this Letter exploits these generic features of BSM signals in an analysis of the m jj and angular distributions.",

CDF, CMS, and AT-LAS dijet searches such as those described in Refs. [6,8,13,14,17] have found that expressions similar to Eq. (1) describe dijet mass distributions observed at lower collision energies. The ansatz also describes leading-order and next-to-leading order simulations of QCD dijet production at \u221a s = 13 TeV. A log-likelihood-ratio statistic employing Wilks's theorem [50] was used to determine if the background estimation would be significantly improved by an additional degree of freedom. With the current dataset, Eq. (1) was found to be sufficient. Fig. 1 also shows the result of the fit. The fit describes the observed data with a p-value of 0.87, using a Poisson likelihood test statistic. The middle panel of the figure shows the significances of bin-by-bin differences between the data and the fit. These Gaussian significances are calculated from the Poisson probability, considering only statistical uncertainties. The lower panel compares the data to the prediction of Pythia 8 simulation of QCD processes, corrected for NLO and electroweak effects.

For each interval in the scan, it computes the significance of any excess found. The algorithm identifies the interval 1.53-1.61 TeV, indicated by the two vertical lines in Fig. 1, as the most discrepant interval. The statistical significance of this outcome is evaluated using the ensemble of possible outcomes across all intervals scanned, by applying the algorithm to many pseudo-data samples drawn randomly from the background fit.

Excited quarks (q * ) [39,40] are predicted in models of compositeness and are a benchmark for quark-gluon resonances [8,9,14,15]. The q * model is simulated with Pythia 8, assuming spin-1/2 excited quarks with coupling constants the same as for SM quarks. As in Ref. [40], the compositeness scale is set equal to the excited quark mass, m q * , and the SU(3), SU(2), and U(1) coupling multipliers f s = f = f = 1. The renormalization and factorization scales are set to the average p T of the two leading jets. In the simulation, only the decay of the excited quark to a gluon and an up-or down-type quark is modelled; this corresponds to a branching ratio of 85%. Before parton shower effects are taken into account, the intrinsic width of the q * signals is comparable to the detector resolution. The resonance selection acceptance times efficiency for a q * with a mass of 4 TeV is 58%.",

A W model [41] with V -A SM couplings and a corresponding branching ratio to dijets of 75% is considered. In this analysis, events are simulated in Pythia 8 and decays are restricted to quark-antiquark pairs with all six quark flavours included. Events including top decays were not removed from the analysis, resulting in conservative limits. A leptophobic Z model [42] is also simulated, with matrix elements calculated in MadGraph 5 [68] and parton showering performed in Pythia 8. The Z model assumes axial-vector couplings to all SM quarks and to a Dirac fermion dark matter candidate. No interference with the SM is simulated for either the W or the Z model and decays involving top quarks are included. The Z model considered follows a scenario [43] where its decays to dark matter are negligible, hence the dijet production rate and resonance width depend only on the coupling to quarks, g q , and the mass of the resonance m Z . Before parton shower effects are considered, the intrinsic width of the W and Z signals range from 0.05% for a Z with a mass of 1.5 TeV and g q = 0.1 to 10% for a Z with a mass of 3.5 TeV and g q = 0.5. The resonance selection acceptance times efficiency for a mass of 3 TeV is 40% for the W model and 47% for the Z model with g q = 0.2.",

The method uses a constant prior for signal cross-section and Gaussian priors for nuisance parameters corresponding to systematic uncertainties. The expected limits are calculated using pseudo-experiments generated from the maximum-likelihood values for parameters of the background-only model in Eq. (1) using the full systematic uncertainties in both the signal and background models. The limit is interpolated logarithmically between the discrete masses to create curves continuous in signal mass. The mass limits for each of those models are shown in Figs. 3 and 4 and Table 1. No uncertainty is included for the cross-section of the signals considered. Fig. 5 shows limits on the Gaussian contributions to the observed m jj distribution obtained for a mean mass m G and four different widths, from a width equal to the detector mass resolution to a width of 15% of the mean of the Gaussian mass distribution. Limits are set only when m G is within 1.1 TeV-6.9 TeV and separated by at least twice the width of the Gaussian from the endpoints of this range. Intrinsically narrow resonances with effective cross-sections exceeding values ranging from approximately 50-300 fb for masses below 2 TeV to 2-20 fb for masses above 4 TeV are excluded. As the width increases, the expected signal contribution is distributed across more bins. Therefore wider signals are affected less than narrower signals by statistical fluctuations of the data in a single bin.",
