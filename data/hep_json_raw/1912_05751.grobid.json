Their analysis showed that below the center-of-mass energy (E c.m. ) of 2 GeV the process is dominated by the K * (892) + K * (892) \u2212 intermediate state with a small contribution of the K 0 S K 0 S \u03c1(770) reaction.

In 2017 (about half of integrated luminosity) the beam energy was monitored by the back-scattering laser-light system [10,11], providing an absolute beam-energy monitoring with better than 0.1 MeV uncertainty at every 10-20 minutes of data taking. In earlier runs the beam energy was determined using measurements of charged track momenta in the detector magnetic field with an about 1 MeV uncertainty. Since the cross section of the process is small, we combine our scanned points into eight energy intervals as shown in Table 1.",

            "text": "The general-purpose detector CMD-3 has been described in detail elsewhere [12]. Its tracking system consists of a cylindrical drift chamber (DC) [13] and double-layer multiwire proportional Z-chamber, both also used for a charged track trigger, and both inside a thin (0.2 X 0 ) superconducting solenoid with a field of 1.3 T. The tracking system provides the 98-99% tracking efficiency in about 70% of the solid angle. The liquid xenon (LXe) barrel calorimeter with a 5.4 X 0 thickness has fine electrode structure, providing 1-2 mm spatial resolution for photons independently of their energy [14], and is located in the cryostat vacuum volume outside the solenoid. The barrel CsI crystal calorimeter with a thickness of 8.1 X 0 surrounds the LXe calorimeter, while the endcap BGO calorimeter with a thickness of 13.4 X 0 is placed inside the solenoid [15]. Altogether, the calorimeters cover 0.9 of the solid angle and amplitude signals provide information for the neutral trigger. Charged trigger requires presence of only one charged track in DC, therefore it has practically 100% efficiency for our studied process with five or six detected tracks. A relatively large fraction of these events has sufficient energy deposition in the calorimeter for the independent neutral trigger: these events are used to control the charged trigger efficiency. The luminosity is measured using the Bhabha scattering events at large angles with about 1% systematic uncertainty [16].",

Points with errors represent the contribution of the background, estimated by the \"nine tile\" method of Eq. (1). The background from the beamoriginating events in data is seen in a few first bins and is well estimated by the method: it is not dominating, so we do not impose any restrictions on this distance. The procedure is also applied to the simulation, and Eq. (1) gives about 5% of the \"background\" events ( Fig. 3(b)) due to only one correctly reconstructed K 0 S or due to small non-linearity of events in the bands, which is assumed to be linear for the method.
