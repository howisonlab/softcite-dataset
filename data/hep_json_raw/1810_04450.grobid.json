The superconducting magnets of the LHC require very efficient halo-cleaning, which is realised by a multi-step cleaning system [23]. The primary and secondary collimators of the cleaning insertions in IR3 and IR7 intercept most of the off-momentum and betatron halo. A small fraction of the protons escape these insertions and constitute the tertiary halo (labelled 2 in figure 3) which is intercepted by the tertiary collimators (TCTs), located at distances of z \u2248 150 m from each experimental IP. Protons impinging on the TCTs can also originate from elastic beamgas interactions (labelled 3 in figure 3), which deflect protons out of the beam, around the whole accelerator ring. The losses on the TCTs create showers, which can propagate all the way to the IP. Dedicated tests [24] during 2015 and 2016 showed that, in normal physics conditions, total losses -5 -Fora;",

Although the rates are negligible compared to particle debris from almost 10 9 proton-proton (pp) collisions per second, BIB has particular features that render it potentially problematic: it is characterised by particles almost parallel to the beam line, which can produce elongated clusters with large energy deposition in the innermost tracking detectors based on silicon pixel technology. At high rates, these abnormally large clusters can affect data-taking efficiency [2]. Furthermore, a potential background for physics analyses arises from high-energy muons, originating mostly from pion and kaon decay in the hadronic showers induced by beam losses. These muons can deposit large amounts of energy in calorimeters through radiative processes. Such energy depositions, which are not associated with a hard scattering at the interaction point (IP), can be reconstructed as fake jets leading to Table 1. LHC parameters during operation as a pp collider in the second half of 2012. The parameter \u03b2 * refers to the value of the optical \u03b2-function at the collision point. missing transverse momentum if overlaid with a collision event. Especially in searches for some exotic physics processes [3][4][5][6], fake jets represent a non-negligible background that must be well controlled and subtracted. Although BIB has had no detrimental effects on ATLAS operation so far, the continuous striving for better LHC luminosity performance might change this situation in the future. A thorough understanding of the sources and nature of BIB, which is crucial when planning upgrades to the LHC, can only be achieved by a combination of measurements and simulations. A validation of the latter is the main purpose of this work.",

The latter is a property of the beams and is measured by the LHC with percent-level accuracy, but the pressure and molecular composition of the residual gas varies as a function of position around the accelerator. After pumping down of the LHC beam vacuum, a small amount of gas remains stuck on the beam-pipe surface. These gas molecules can be desorbed by synchrotron radiation or charged particles hitting the beam-pipe walls. The rate of outgassing depends on the intensity of the radiation and therefore the dynamical pressure depends on beam intensity and energy. In addition, the surface characteristics and temperature have a large influence on the residual pressure. The residual gas consists of H 2 , CH 4 , CO 2 and CO. Their relative fractions depend on local temperature, radiation load and surface characteristics of the beam pipe. In cryogenic sectors the gas condenses on the cold walls, but is relatively easily released by irradiation. Almost all room-temperature sectors of the LHC beam pipe are coated with a non-evaporable getter material [25], which provides distributed pumping along the beam line for all common gases except CH 4 . Therefore, methane is the dominant gas species in room-temperature sections, including the D1 dipole. Inside cryogenic magnets where the cold bore is at 1.9 K, notably those of the inner triplet and the LHC arc, all gases except hydrogen stick relatively firmly on the surface, so the dominant gas is H 2 . The magnets in the LSS, from D2 to the arc, are operated at 4.5 K. At this temperature all gases are more easily desorbed and here CO 2 is the most abundant gas species. Vacuum pumps produce local minima in the pressure and corresponding gradients which result in gas diffusion from sections with higher pressure towards the pumps.",

The simulation models are based on theory and laboratory measurements of desorption rates and gas composition [26]. The amount of gas on the surfaces depends on the beam-conditioning history: when gas is desorbed and pumped out during beam operation the rate of outgassing slowly goes down. The state of surface conditioning, at any given time, has to be empirically estimated based on prior experience. Thus, the simulations depend on the local characteristics and temperature of the beam pipe, local pumping speeds, beam intensity and the estimated effects of the beam-conditioning history. The overall uncertainty in the local pressure due to knowledge of these parameters, especially of the state of surface conditioning, is estimated to be a factor of \u223c3.

[31]: beam-gas events with a uniform distribution in a z-range from 22.6 m to 546.6 m were generated with F as inelastic p-N 2 interactions. Although the residual gas composition varies along the ring and H 2 is most abundant in 1.9 K sections, the much larger interaction cross-sections of the other gas species causes them to dominate the interaction rate, especially in the LSS. Nitrogen is therefore considered to represent a good average of the atomic composition of the residual gas [14]. Using a generic gas species and a uniform distribution of events has the advantage that the same simulation results can be used with different pressure distributions. Unlike most previous studies [10][11][12][13], all simulations in this work were performed without any Monte Carlo variance reduction techniques,2 in order to preserve correlations within individual events. This is a prerequisite for reconstructing the trigger signatures. In the first simulation step, the secondaries produced in the beam-gas interactions are transported to a virtual interface plane at z = 22.6 m upstream of the IP.

Depositions at times larger than 50 ns are excluded in order to prevent small depositions with very large delay, e.g. from thermal neutron capture, to influence the average time.

A wider summing range in z mostly adds this ionisation energy loss of the muon, which would be a non-negligible contribution to the lowest jet energies considered in this study. The average energy lost by the muon, however, is below the threshold of the ATLAS jet reconstruction, so in data only upward fluctuations of the muon energy loss are likely to be combined into the jet, if they happen close enough to the large radiative loss.

In the inner triplet, p-H 2 scattering contributes about 90% of the beam-gas interactions, while the simulations are based on p-N 2 events. Equation (5.1) ensures that the correct number of beamgas collisions is generated in the simulations, but it does not account for differences in the collision dynamics, especially the multiplicity of produced secondaries. In order to estimate the possible dependence of the background rate on the target nuclide, the less CPU-intensive simulations at z < 22.6 m were repeated with p-H 2 events. The rate was found to decrease by about 15%. Assuming a similar reduction for the inner-triplet region, where most of the BCM background originates from (see section 7), the use of proton-N 2 events overestimates the BCM trigger rate by up to 15%.",

The histograms represent the time distribution of hits in upstream BCM modules for events which give the BCM background signature in beam-1 unpaired bunches. The plain F simulations yield a very narrow time distribution with a vertical rising edge. In the analysis, this is smeared by the 0.25 ns time fluctuation due to the LHC bunch length of 75 mm.5 A larger broadening effect comes from the instrumental resolution and time alignment of the BCM. In order to account for these, the rising edge of the simulated time distribution is fitted to that in data with the time alignment and time resolution as free parameters. Values of -1.0 ns and 0.55 ns are found for these parameters respectively. The fit yields an uncertainty of about 10% in both parameters. The observed time shift is well within the 2 ns alignment tolerance specified for the BCM. The fitted time resolution is about 30% better than that found in test-beams [21]. However, it agrees, within its 10% uncertainty, with the resolution derived from in-situ monitoring of the time difference between hits in upstream and downstream modules in collision events recorded by the BCM detector. The data shown in figure 9 are extracted from the events recorded during the first ten minutes of each LHC fill. A determination of the fill-to-fill variation for each bin is not feasible since, especially in the tail region, the very low counting rate causes many bins to have zero counts for a single fill. If, however, the shape of the distribution is assumed to be invariant between fills, the fill-to-fill variation of each bin can be taken as 27%, which is the value given in table 3 for the total rate. The blue band shown around the data in figure 9 illustrates this fill-to-fill variation, but takes also into account the total counting statistics in each bin. The uncertainty in the mean value in each bin is determined from the data in all fills and shown by the smaller error bars on the data. For the simulations, only the statistical uncertainties are shown. The error bars on the ratio of simulation to data are based on the statistical uncertainties only.

The open squares in figure 9 show that the events within the ATLAS experimental area contribute only 20% to the total hit rate but the shape, especially the peak-to-tail ratio, is similar to that of the total rate. If the tail were due to delayed arrival of some particles from distant events, i.e. due to a dependence between time spread and distance to the event, then it should not appear for the beam-gas events at z < 22.6 m. The fact that a tail of similar height, relative to the peak, is seen in both distributions indicates that the delayed particles are due to a local effect. The simulated hits in the tail are found to be caused by particles with a kinetic energy below \u223c10 MeV and if the solenoidal field is turned off in the simulations, the tail is suppressed. These findings indicate that the tail is due to low-energy particles looping in the magnetic field and accumulating a delay due to the longer path along the helix. Since such lowenergy particles have a short range in matter already a slightly too large amount of material in the simulation geometry, with respect to reality, is sufficient to explain the observed underestimation.",

Therefore the simulation results are compared with jet data calibrated to the electromagnetic energy scale rather than with fully calibrated jets, which are corrected for the non-compensating response of the calorimeter to hadrons. Possible jets from collisions of the protons in the unpaired bunch with ghost charge in the other beam are removed by rejecting events for which a primary vertex has been reconstructed from the tracks measured by the inner detector. Only the highest-p T jet in each event is included in the analysis. In the endcap calorimeters, hadronic showers can contribute to the fake jets. Since only muons are considered in the simulations, the analysis is restricted to |\u03b7| < 1.5, i.e. the barrel calorimeters. These are at large radii and shadowed by other detector elements so hadronic showers from the beam line cannot reach them. Figure 10 shows the x-y distribution of muons with energy E > 20 GeV reaching the interface plane. This distribution reflects the geometry of the LHC tunnel, and also the effect of some beamline magnets. The tunnel's radius of 2.2 m and the floor at y = -1.1 m produce a relatively sharp edge in the muon flux. The higher rate seen on the inside of the ring at y \u2248 \u00b11 m, between x \u2248 1.5 m and x \u2248 2.5 m, is due to the offset of the beam line relative to the centre of the tunnel, leaving more free space for pions and kaons to decay into muons on the inside of the ring. The \"hot spots\" seen around x \u2248 \u00b10.8 m are mainly due to bending of the off-momentum muons by the D1 and D2 dipoles of the LSS. The vertical spread at x = 0 is probably due to bending in the quadrupoles of the inner triplet, although the crossing angle might also have some influence on this.",

However, since this increase is due to including the ionisation energy loss of the passing muon, it does not seem justified to consider it as a systematic uncertainty, but rather an upper limit thereof.

Such differences could arise, for instance, if the z-distribution of the beam-gas events is not correct. A wrong z-distribution could change the impact of the reduced, or increased, free drift space. Another possibility is an inaccurate description of material around the beam line, which would affect the free drift space available. Forthcoming background measurements, with artificially introduced local pressure bumps, may shed some light on this. Cosmic-ray muons, which can also produce fake jets, are included in the data but not in the simulation. Studies reported in ref. [16] indicate that the fake-jet rate at low p T arising from cosmic-ray muons is less than 10% of the total rate due to BIB. The radiative energy losses are point-like processes and since the flux of cosmic muons is uniform in space and time, the rate of fake jets produced by them should be independent of \u03c6. However, due to the significant variation of the rate as a function of \u03c6, a visible contribution from cosmic-ray induced fake jets cannot be entirely excluded around \u03c6 = \u2212\u03c0/2, where the rates are lowest.",

            "text": "Knowledge of the z-coordinate of the origin of each simulated event provides information beyond that which can be extracted from the data. Figure 14 shows the distribution of the origins of the simulated events that give a BCM background trigger signature or generate a fake jet in the barrel calorimeters. The black histogram, which shows the z-distribution of the generated events, reflects the residual gas distribution in the beam pipe and is equivalent to figure 6. Most of the events with a BCM background trigger signature originate from the inner-triplet region (z \u2248 22-55 m) with a small contribution from z \u2248 150 m, where the tertiary collimator causes a local pressure bump. This result is consistent with the observations made in the data, that the BCM background trigger rate correlates with the residual gas pressure measured by vacuum gauges at z = 22 m [16]. The fake jets, on the contrary, originate predominantly from more distant beam losses with pronounced spikes at the locations of the 4.5 K magnets. According to the simulations, about 10% of fake-jet events are associated with beam-gas events in the LHC arc (z >270 m), but this fraction depends strongly on the relative pressure in 4.5 K and 1.9 K sections. The lower plot in figure 14 shows the cumulative distributions corresponding to the histograms in the upper plot. These highlight that practically all BCM background events originate from z < 60 m while only \u223c1% of fake-jet events are associated with beam-gas collisions in that z-range. Since the simulations disfavour any significant correlation between BCM background and fake jets in the barrel calorimeters, they suggest that BCM and fake-jet rates, seen in the data, can be used to disentangle backgrounds originating from different regions in z. As discussed before, the residual gas pressure depends on local properties of the beam pipe, such as material and temperature, and also on the radiation intensity. Therefore the pressure in different z-regions, as well as its uncertainties, can be considered to be uncorrelated. In particular, the prediction of BCM background, which originates predominantly from the inner triplet, depends on the accuracy of the pressure simulations within 1.9 K magnets. Most of the fake -21 -  Figure 14. Distributions of the z-coordinate of the origin of simulated beam-gas events giving a BIB signature in ATLAS detectors. The solid blue circles show the z-distribution of events that give a BCM beam background signature while the open red circles show the z-distribution of beam-gas events that result in energy deposition clusters with p T > 16 GeV and |\u03b7| <1.5 in the calorimeters. The z-distribution of the generated events (black line) corresponds to the beam-gas rate shown in figure 6, i.e. reflects the residual gas distribution in the beam pipe. The small inset shows the region z < 25 m in more detail. The lower plot shows the cumulative rate, as a function of z, of events resulting in BCM background events or fake jets. At large z these two histograms converge to the total simulated rates given in tables 3 and 4 respectively. jets originate from the beam-gas events within 4.5 K magnets where the desorption characteristics and, therefore, the gas composition, are different. Thus it is not surprising to find, in tables 3 and 4, better agreement in one observable than in the other.",
