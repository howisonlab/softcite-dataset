An analysis of this three-body final state is performed using a 1:0 fb \u00c01 sample of data produced in 7 TeV pp collisions at the LHC and collected by the LHCb experiment. A modified Dalitz plot analysis of the final state is performed using both the invariant mass spectra and the decay angular distributions. The \u00fe \u00c0 system is shown to be dominantly in an S-wave state, and the CP-odd fraction in this \" B 0 s decay is shown to be greater than 0.977 at 95% confidence level. In addition, we report the first measurement of the J=c \u00fe \u00c0 branching fraction relative to J=c of \u00f019:79 AE 0:47 AE 0:52\u00de%.",

Final states that are CP eigenstates with large rates and high detection efficiencies are very useful for such studies. The \" B 0 s ! J=c f 0 \u00f0980\u00de, f 0 \u00f0980\u00de ! \u00fe \u00c0 decay mode, a CP-odd eigenstate, was discovered by the LHCb Collaboration [1] and subsequently confirmed by several experiments [2]. As we use the J=c ! \u00fe \u00c0 decay, the final state has four charged tracks and has high detection efficiency. LHCb has used this mode to measure the CP violating phase s [3], which complements measurements in the J=c final state [4,5]. It is possible that a larger \u00fe \u00c0 mass range could also be used for such studies. Therefore, to fully exploit the J=c \u00fe \u00c0 final state for measuring CP violation, it is important to determine its resonant and CP content. The tree-level Feynman diagram for the process is shown in Fig. 1.",

Components include a high precision tracking system consisting of a silicon-strip vertex detector surrounding the pp interaction region, a largearea silicon-strip detector located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4 Tm, and three stations of silicon-strip detectors and straw drift tubes placed downstream. The combined tracking system has a momentum resolution \u00c1p=p that varies from 0.4% at 5 GeV to 0.6% at 100 GeV (we work in units where c \u00bc 1), and an impact parameter resolution of 20 m for tracks with large transverse momentum with respect to the proton beam direction. Charged hadrons are identified using two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors. Photon, electron, and hadron candidates are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter, and a hadronic calorimeter. Muons are identified by a muon system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers. The trigger consists of a hardware stage, based on information from the calorimeter and muon systems, followed by a software stage that applies a full event reconstruction. Events selected for this analysis are triggered by a J=c ! \u00fe \u00c0 decay. Muon candidates are selected at the hardware level using their penetration through iron and detection in a series of tracking chambers. They are also required in the software level to be consistent with coming from the decay of a \" B 0 s meson into a J=c . Only J=c decays that are triggered on are used.",

After applying these requirements, there is a large J=c signal over a small background [1]. Only candidates with dimuon invariant mass between \u00c048 MeV to \u00fe43 MeV relative to the observed J=c mass peak are selected. The requirement is asymmetric because of final-state electromagnetic radiation. The two muons subsequently are kinematically constrained to the known J=c mass [8].",

This includes both signal and background. Possible resonance candidates in the decay \" B 0 s ! J=c \u00fe \u00c0 are listed in Table I. To understand what resonances are likely to contribute, it is important to realize that the s\" s system in Fig. 1 is isoscalar (I \u00bc 0) so when it produces a single meson it must have zero isospin, resulting in a symmetric isospin wave function for the two-pion system. Since the two pions must be in an overall symmetric state, they must have even total angular momentum. In fact we only need to consider spin-0 and spin-2 particles as there are no known spin-4 particles in the kinematically accessible mass range below 1600 MeV. The particles that could appear are spin-0 f 0 \u00f0600\u00de, spin-0 f 0 \u00f0980\u00de, spin-2 f 2 \u00f01270\u00de, spin-0 f 0 \u00f01370\u00de, and spin-0 f 0 \u00f01500\u00de. Diagrams of higher order than the one shown in Fig. 1 could result in the production of isospin-one \u00fe \u00c0 resonances, thus we use the \u00f0770\u00de as a test of the presence of these higher order processes.",

By far the largest uncertainty in every rate, except the total, is caused by our choice of the preferred versus the alternate solutions. Using the difference between these fit results for the systematic uncertainty causes relatively large and asymmetric values. We also include systematic uncertainties due to the possible presence of the \u00f0770\u00de, the f 0 \u00f01500\u00de, or the f 0 \u00f0600\u00de resonances by taking the maximum difference between the fit including one of these resonances and our preferred solution, if the difference is larger than the one between the preferred and alternate 3R \u00fe NR fit. In the case of the f 0 \u00f01500\u00de the preferred solution is pathological in that it produces an unacceptably large f 0 \u00f01370\u00de component along with a 214% component sum; therefore, here we use the alternate solution that is much better behaved.",

The size of these differences depends on the mass range for the particular component multiplied by the possible efficiency variation across this mass range. This is estimated as 1% for the entire mass range and is smaller for individual resonances. Small uncertainties are introduced if the simulation does not have the correct \" B 0 s kinematic distributions. We are relatively insensitive to any of these differences in the \" B 0 s , p, and p T distributions since we are measuring relative rates. These distributions are varied by changing the weights in each bin by plus and minus the statistical error in that bin. We see at most a 0.5% change. There is a 2% systematic uncertainty assigned for the relative particle identification efficiencies. These efficiencies have been corrected from those predicted in the simulation by using pion data from K 0 s ! \u00fe \u00c0 decays and kaon and pion  data from D \u00c3AE ! AE D 0 \u00f0 \" D 0 \u00de, D 0 \u00f0 \" D 0 \u00de ! K \u00c7 AE decays. The uncertainty on the corrections is 0.5% per track. The background modeling was changed by using a secondorder polynomial shape in the J=c \u00fe \u00c0 mass fit giving a 0.6% change in the signal yield. Since the input f 0 \u00f01370\u00de mass and width parameters were allowed to vary within Gaussian constraints, there is no additional uncertainty to account for.",

This is accomplished by increasing the minimum IP 2 requirement from 9 to 12.25 on both of the kaon candidates, which has the effect of increasing the 2 =ndf of the fit to angular distributions by 1 unit. The Monte Carlo simulation of \" B 0 s ! J=c \u00fe \u00c0 with the changed requirement is then fitted to get an acceptance function. This acceptance function is then applied to the data with the original minimum IP 2 cut of 9, and the likelihood fit is redone.
