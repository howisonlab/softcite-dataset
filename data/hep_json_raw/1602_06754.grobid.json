These decays are expected to proceed via the annihilation of cc into three gluons or a virtual photon.

Recently, a review of the theoretical and experimental results [4] concluded that the current theoretical explanations are unsatisfactory, especially for the baryon pair decays of \u03c8 mesons. Therefore, more experimental measurements on baryon-antibaryon (BB) pair final states, e.g. pp, \u039b\u039b, \u03a3\u03a3, \u039e\u039e, \u03a3(1385)\u03a3(1385), in the decays of \u03c8 are desirable.

Various theoretical calculations based on first-order QCD have made predictions for the value of \u03b1. In the prediction of Claudson et al. [10], the baryon mass is taken into account as a whole, while the constituent quarks inside the baryon are considered as massless when computing the decay amplitude. The prediction by Carimalo [11] takes the mass effects at the quark level into account. Experimental efforts are useful to measure \u03b1 in order to test the hadron helicity conservation rule and study the validity of the various theoretical approaches. In the previous experiments, the angular distributions are measured with a few decays, such as \u03c8(3686) \u2192 pp [12] and J/\u03c8 \u2192 BB (pp, \u039b\u039b, \u03a3 0\u03a30 , \u039e \u2212\u039e+ , \u03a3(1385)\u03a3(1385)) [8,[13][14][15].

To achieve a higher efficiency, a single baryon \u039e \u2212 (\u03a3(1385) \u2213 ) tag technique, which does not include the anti-baryon mode tag, is employed to select the signal events \u03c8 \u2192 \u039e \u2212\u039e+ (\u03a3(1385) \u2213\u03a3 (1385) \u00b1 ), where only the \u039e \u2212 (\u03a3(1385) \u2213 ) is reconstructed in its decay to \u03c0 \u2213 \u039b with the subsequent decay \u039b \u2192 p\u03c0 \u2212 .

Only tracks that are reconstructed in the MDC with good helix fits and within the angular coverage of the MDC (| cos \u03b8| < 0.93, where \u03b8 is the polar angle with respect to the e + beam direction) are considered. Information from the specific energy loss measured in MDC (dE/dx) and from TOF are combined to form particle identification (PID) confidence levels for the hypotheses of a pion, kaon, and proton, respectively. Each track is assigned to the particle type that corresponds to the hypothesis with the highest confidence level.

Due to the imperfection of the simulation of the momentum spectrum of the pion from \u039e or \u03a3(1385) decays, a mass shift (\u223c2 MeV/c 2 ) between data and MC is observed in the M recoil \u03c0 \u2213 \u039b spectrum for the J/\u03c8 decays (the mass shift in \u03c8(3686) decay is negligible), which may affect the signal yields since they are obtained by fitting with the corresponding MC shape convoluted with a Gaussian function. To estimate the corresponding effect, the shift of the M recoil \u03c0 \u2213 \u039b spectrum for the simulated exclusive MC events is corrected, and then the data is refitted with the same method as the nominal fit.

A comparison of the branching fractions and \u03b1 values between our measurements and previous experiments is summarized in Tables IV and V, where the branching fractions for \u03c8(3686) \u2192 \u03a3(1385) \u2213\u03a3 (1385) \u00b1 and the angular distributions for \u03c8(3686) \u2192 \u039e \u2212\u039e+ and \u03a3(1385) \u2213\u03a3 (1385) \u00b1 are measured for the first time.

The measured \u03b1 values are also compared with the predictions in theoretical models [10,11]. As indicated in Table V, most of our results disagree significantly with the theoretical predictions, which implies that the naive prediction of QCD suffers from the approximation that higher order corrections are not taken into account. The theoretical models are expected to be improved in order to understand the origin of these discrepancies. To test the \"12% rule\", the branching fraction ratios B(\u03c8(3686)\u2192\u039e \u2212\u039e+ ) B(J/\u03c8\u2192\u039e \u2212\u039e+ ) , B(\u03c8(3686)\u2192\u03a3(1385) \u2212\u03a3 (1385) are calculated to be (26.73 \u00b1 0.50 \u00b1 2.30)%, (7.76 \u00b1 0.55 \u00b1 0.68)% and (6.68 \u00b1 0.40 \u00b1 0.50)%, respectively, taking into account common systematic uncertainties.
