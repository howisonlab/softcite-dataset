Since the first observation of BEC in proton-antiproton interactions fifty years ago [1], a large number of measurements have been performed by experiments using different initial states [2,3]. At the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC), BEC were observed for the first time by CMS using data at centre-of-mass energies \u221a s = 0.9 and 2.36 TeV, collected in 2009 [4]; measurements by ALICE at 0.9 TeV were reported in [5]. The present paper reports measurements using data taken in 2010 at 0.9 TeV, with a sample increase by a factor 15, and at 7 TeV, for the first time. The analysis method is similar to that in [4], where more details can be found. In this article the results at the two energies are compared and additional studies are performed.",

The central feature of the CMS apparatus is a superconducting solenoid of 6 m internal diameter, providing an axial magnetic field of 3.8 T. The inner tracking system is the most relevant detector for the present analysis. It is composed of a pixel detector with three barrel layers at radii between 4.4 and 10.2 cm and a silicon strip tracker with 10 barrel detection layers extending outwards to a radius of 1.1 m. Each system is completed by two endcaps, extending the acceptance up to a pseudorapidity |\u03b7| = 2.5. The transverse-momentum (p T ) resolution, for 1 GeV charged particles, is between 0.7% at \u03b7 = 0 and 2% at |\u03b7| = 2.5. Minimum-bias events were selected by requiring activity in both beam scintillator counters [10]. Charged particles are required to have |\u03b7| < 2.4 and p T > 200 MeV, ensuring that particles emitted from the interaction region cross all three barrel layers of the pixel detector and thus have good two-track separation. To achieve a high purity of the primary track selection, the trajectories are required to be reconstructed in fits with more than five degrees of freedom (N dof ) and \u03c7 2 /N dof < 5.0. The transverse impact parameter with respect to the collision point is required to be less than 0.15 cm. The innermost measured point of the track must be within 20 cm of the beam axis, in order to reduce contamination from electrons and positrons from photon conversions in the detector material and secondary particles from decay of long-lived hadrons.",

In the case of pairs from mixed events, particles from different events are combined with the following methods: i) events are mixed at random; ii) events with similar charged-particle multiplicities in the same \u03b7 regions are selected; iii) events with an invariant mass of all charged particles similar to that of the signal are used to form the pairs. In this paper, we use the sample obtained by pairing same-sign charged particles from different events that have similar charged-particle multiplicities in the same \u03b7 regions. This method avoids the possible effect of remaining correlations [18] between particles within the same event. The r.m.s. spread of the results obtained from the different samples is taken as a conservative systematic uncertainty. In [4] an additional, \"combined\" reference sample was obtained by summing the Q distributions of the seven corresponding reference samples.

For the L\u00e9vy parameterization the fitted values are \u03bb = 0.847 \u00b1 0.057, r = 2.20 \u00b1 0.17 fm, \u03b1 = 0.806 \u00b1 0.033, with \u03c7 2 /N dof = 453/193 at 0.9 TeV and \u03bb = 0.896 \u00b1 0.051, r = 2.83 \u00b1 0.18 fm, \u03b1 = 0.792 \u00b1 0.024, with \u03c7 2 /N dof = 676/193 at 7 TeV. These values confirm the data tendency to prefer an exponent \u03b1 < 1 as in [4]. Large (anti)correlations are, however, observed among various parameters, which can lead to large variations of numerical values. As a cross-check of the stability of the measurement of the width of the peak at small Q and of the fact that it does not depend on the fit quality, the average values (first moment) of the \u2126(Qr) distributions over the same interval in Q are found to be consistent for the different functions. More discussion on the shape of the R distribution and on the fit quality can be found at the end of this section.",

In addition, we consider here the systematic uncertainty due to the choice of the MC sample; it is obtained from the r.m.s. spread of results obtained using the various MC simulations listed in section 2. The results at 7 TeV show a larger dependence on the MC choice than at 0.9 TeV. The uncertainty related to the Coulomb corrections JHEP05 2011 is taken to be \u00b115%, as determined in [4], which covers the spread from the different parameterizations [22]. The Coulomb corrections affect the signal mainly at very low Q, leading to an uncertainty of \u00b12.8% on \u03bb and \u00b10.8% on r. Finally we consider the uncertainty due to the choice of the fit range. It is evaluated as the r.m.s. spread of the results obtained by moving the upper limit of the fit from Q = 1.8 GeV to Q = 2.4 GeV. The first value (1.8 GeV) is chosen such that the anticorrelation region (see below) is fully contained in the fit range, while the second one is limited by the fact that for higher values the fit quality further degrades, indicating that the functions do not provide a good description of the baseline curve in that region (this observation does not depend on the choice of the function in the signal region). Contributions to the systematic uncertainties are reported in table 2, and the total systematic uncertainties are obtained from their quadratic sum. It was checked that reducing the fit range to 0.04 < Q < 2 GeV, thus excluding the first two points at low Q in As will be shown below, the increase of r is related to the different average chargedparticle multiplicities at the two energies, while the value of the \u03bb parameter is constant within errors.",

The k T dependence of the r and \u03bb parameters for three intervals of multiplicity, obtained with the exponential parameterization, is shown in figure 3 and given in table 3 for the 0.9 and 7 TeV data. The effective radius r is observed to increase with multiplicity, for all reference samples and for all MC models and tunes, in agreement with previous results. At low multiplicity, r is approximately independent of k T , and it decreases with k T as N ch increases. The \u03bb parameter decreases with increasing multiplicity and k T . The systematic uncertainties are estimated to be the same as for the overall measurements (4.7% and 6.8% for \u03bb, 9.6% and 11.1% for r, at 0.9 and 7 TeV, respectively). It should be noted that these uncertainties are point-to-point correlated, since the effects of the choice of the various reference samples and of the various MC simulations are very similar for the different subsamples. The 0.9 TeV results agree with those of ALICE [5]. Figure 4 presents the distribution of the parameter r as a function of N ch for both centre-of-mass energies. The measurements are consistent, indicating that the difference between the values of r obtained for the two global samples are accounted for by the different average charged-particle multiplicities, which are 12.1 and 19.2 for the 0.9 and 7 TeV cases, respectively. This trend is consistent with the result of a similar comparison between data at 0.9 and 2.36 TeV [4]. The multiplicity dependence is fitted as r(",

This model was derived initially in [7] for describing point-like interactions, such as in e + e \u2212 collisions. It assumes that particle production has a broad distribution in proper time but the phase-space distribution of emitted particles is dominated by strong correlations between the space-time coordinates and the momentum components of the emitted particles.

However, as for the L\u00e9vy function, large (anti)correlations among parameters are observed, which induce a variability of their nominal values. The depth of the dip in the anticorrelation region is measured as the difference \u2206 between the baseline curve defined as C \u2022 (1 + \u03b4Q) and the value of R defined by eq. (4.1) at its minimum. Results are shown in figure 7. The depths are found to decrease with N ch consistently for the two centre-of-mass energies. The systematic errors have been computed from the r.m.s. spread of the results obtained with the various reference samples, MC simulations and fit ranges. It has been checked that these results are robust: when the fitting range is extended as far as to Q = 5 GeV, where the baseline description may not be good, the results are consistent within errors and the trend is similar.",

The signal is observed as an enhancement of pairs of same-sign charged particles with small relative momentum. The parameters are obtained from fits using the exponential parameterization for \u2126(Qr) to the distribution of Q. In agreement with previous results, an increase of the effective emission radius r with charged-particle multiplicity in the event is observed, which accounts for the increase of r from 0.9 to 7 TeV. The parameter r is nearly independent of the average transverse momentum of the pair of particles at the lowest multiplicity range, and decreases with k T in events with large charged-particle multiplicity. For the first time in pp interactions, anticorrelations between same-sign charged particles are JHEP05 (2011)029observed for Q values above the signal region, as previously reported with LEP data. The anticorrelation effects decrease with increasing charged-particle multiplicity in the event considered in this analysis.",
