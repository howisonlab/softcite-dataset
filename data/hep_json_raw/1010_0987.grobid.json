The value of |V ub | can thus be determined by the measurement of partial branching fractions of charmless semileptonic B decays. Extraction of the f + (q 2 ) form-factor shapes from exclusive decays [6] such as B 0 \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 \u2113 + \u03bd [7] and B + \u2192 \u03b7 (\u2032) \u2113 + \u03bd may be used to test theoretical calculations [8]. The values of the branching fractions (BF) of the B + \u2192 \u03b7 (\u2032) \u2113 + \u03bd decays will also improve our knowledge of the composition of charmless semileptonic decays and help constrain the size of the gluonic singlet contribution to the form factors for these decays [5].",

Electrons (muons) are identified by their characteristic shower signatures in the electromagnetic calorimeter (muon detector), while charged hadrons are identified using the Cherenkov detector and dE/dx measurements in the drift chamber. The average electron (muon) reconstruction efficiency is 93% (70%), while its misidentification probability is < 0.2% (< 1.5%). The neutrino four-momentum, P \u03bd = (| p miss |, p miss ), is inferred from the difference between the momentum of the colliding-beam particles p beams and the vector sum of the momenta of all the particles detected in a single event p tot , such that p miss = p beams \u2212 p tot . To evaluate E tot , the energy sum of all the particles, we assume zero mass for all neutrals since photons are difficult to disentangle from neutral hadrons and we take the mass given by the particle identification selectors for the charged particles. In this analysis, we calculate the momentum transfer as q 2 = (P B \u2212 P meson ) 2 instead of q 2 = (P \u2113 + P \u03bd ) 2 , where P B , P meson and P \u2113 are the four-momenta of the B meson, of the \u03c0, \u03b7 or \u03b7 \u2032 meson, and of the lepton, respectively. With this choice, the value of q 2 is unaffected by any mis-reconstruction of the rest of the event. Here P B has an effective value. To estimate this value, we first combine the lepton with a \u03c0, \u03b7 or \u03b7 \u2032 meson to form the so-called Y pseudo-particle. The angle, \u03b8 BY , between the Y and B momenta in the \u03a5(4S) frame, can be determined by assuming B \u2192 Y \u03bd. In this frame, the Y momentum, the B momentum and the angle \u03b8 BY define a cone with the Y momentum as its axis and where the true B momentum lies somewhere on the surface of the cone. The B rest frame is thus known up to an azimuthal angle \u03c6 defined with respect to the Y momentum. The value of q 2 is then computed as the average of four q 2 values corresponding to four possible angles, \u03c6, \u03c6 + \u03c0/2, \u03c6 + \u03c0, \u03c6 + 3\u03c0/2 rad, where the angle \u03c6 is chosen randomly and where the four values of q 2 are weighted by the factor sin 2 \u03b8 B , \u03b8 B being the angle between the B direction and the beam direction in the \u03a5(4S) frame [19]. We note that, \u03b8 BY being a real angle, | cos \u03b8 BY | \u2264 1. We correct for the reconstruction effects on the q 2 resolution (0.51 GeV 2 ) by applying an unregularized unfolding algorithm to the measured q 2 spectra [20].",

This background is further suppressed for B 0 \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 \u2113 + \u03bd by selections on the number of charged particle tracks and neutral calorimeter clusters [22] that reject radiative Bhabha and converted photon processes.

For the B + \u2192 \u03b7 (\u2032) \u2113 + \u03bd decays, we restrict the reconstructed masses of the \u03b7 \u2032 and \u03b7 to lie in the intervals 0.92 < m \u03b7 \u2032 < 0.98 GeV and 0.51 < m \u03b7 < 0.57 GeV. For these decays, we also reject events with q 2 higher than 16 GeV 2 , since the signal is dominated by background in that range. Most backgrounds are reduced by q 2 -dependent selections on the angle (cos \u03b8 thrust ) between the thrust axes of the Y and of the rest of the event, on the polar angle (\u03b8 miss ) associated with p miss , on the invariant missing mass squared (m 2 miss = E 2 miss \u2212 | p miss | 2 ) divided by twice the missing energy (E miss = E beams \u2212E tot ), and on the helicity angle (cos \u03b8 \u2113 ), the angle between the direction of the W boson (\u2113 and \u03bd combined) in the rest frame of the B meson, and the direction of the lepton in the rest frame of the W boson.

For B + \u2192 \u03b7\u2113 + \u03bd decays, more background is rejected by requiring that | cos \u03b8 V | < 0.95, where \u03b8 V is the helicity angle of the \u03b7 meson [16].",

The q 2 ranges of the background binning for the  for the continuum category. In each case, the q 2 ranges of the two bins are chosen to contain a similar number of events. All the signal and background events, in each q 2 bin, are fitted simultaneously. For the \u03b7 (\u2032) \u2113\u03bd modes, a smaller number of events leads us to restrict the signal and each of the three background categories to a single q 2 bin except for the signal in the \u03b7\u2113\u03bd mode when \u03b7 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3, which is investigated in 3 bins of q 2 . We use the \u2206E-m ES histograms, obtained from the MC simulation as two-dimensional probability density functions (PDFs), in our fit to the data to extract the yields of the signal and backgrounds as a function of q 2 . As an initial estimate, the MC continuum background yield and q 2 -dependent shape are first normalized to match the yield and q 2 -dependent shape of the off-resonance data control sample. This results in a large statistical uncertainty due to the small number of events in the off-peak data. To improve the statistical precision, the continuum background, initially normalized to the off-peak data, is allowed to vary in the fit to the data for the \u03c0\u2113\u03bd and \u03b7\u2113\u03bd(\u03b3\u03b3) modes where we have a large number of events. The fit result is compatible with the off-peak prediction within at most one standard deviation. Because of an insufficient number of events, the b \u2192 u\u2113\u03bd background is fixed in the fit for the \u03b7 (\u2032) \u2113\u03bd modes, and the continuum contribution is also fixed for the \u03b7\u2113\u03bd(3\u03c0) and \u03b7 \u2032 \u2113\u03bd modes. Whenever a background is not varied in the fit, it is fixed to the MC prediction except for the continuum background which is fixed to its normalized yield and q 2 -dependent shape using the offresonanc data. The background parameters which are free in the fit require an adjustment of less than 10% with respect to the MC predictions.

These uncertainties are estimated from the variations of the resulting partial BF values (or total BF values for B + \u2192 \u03b7 \u2032 \u2113 + \u03bd decays) when the data are re-analyzed with different simulation parameters and reweightings. For each parameter,  we use the full MC dataset to generate new \u2206E-m ES distributions (\"MC event samples\") by varying randomly only the parameter of interest over a complete (> 3\u03c3) gaussian distribution whose standard deviation is given by the uncertainty on the specific parameter under investigation. One hundred such samples are generated for each parameter. Uncertainties due to B counting and final state radiation are estimated by generating only one sample. Each MC sample is analyzed the same way as real data to determine values of \u2206B(q 2 ) (or total BF values for B + \u2192 \u03b7 \u2032 \u2113 + \u03bd decays). The contribution of the parameter to the systematic uncertainty is given by the RMS value of the distribution of these values over the one hundred samples. The systematic uncertainties due to the imperfect de-scription of the detector in the simulation are computed by using the uncertainties, determined from control samples, on the tracking efficiency of all charged particle tracks, on the particle identification efficiencies of signal candidate tracks, on the calorimeter efficiencies (varied separately for photons and K 0 L ), on the energy deposited in the calorimeter by K 0 L mesons as well as on their production spectrum. The reconstruction of these neutral particles affects the analysis through the neutrino reconstruction. The uncertainties due to the generator-level inputs to the simulation are given by the uncertainties in the BFs of the background processes b \u2192 u\u2113\u03bd and b \u2192 c\u2113\u03bd, in the BFs of the secondary decays producing leptons [18], and in the BFs of the \u03a5(4S) \u2192 BB decays [8].

The uncertainties in the heavy quark parameters used in the simulation of non-resonant b \u2192 u\u2113\u03bd events are given in Ref. [24]. We assign an uncertainty of 20% [25] to the final state radiation (FSR) corrections calculated by PHOTOS [26]. Finally, the uncertainties due to the modeling of the continuum are established by using the uncertainty in its q 2 distribution shape and, when the continuum background is fixed, the uncertainty in the total yield, both given by comparisons with the off-resonance data control sample.",

The item \"Signal MC stat error\" in these tables includes the systematic uncertainty due to the unfolding procedure. The correlation matrices obtained in the measurement of the partial BFs are presented in Tables X, XI and XII. A condensed version of all the uncertainties is given in Table II together with signal yields and partial BFs in selected q 2 ranges. The values given for the B + \u2192 \u03b7\u2113 + \u03bd decays are those obtained from the fits to the distributions of the \u03b7 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 and \u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 channels combined. The larger relative uncertainties occurring in bin 12 of Table VIII are due to poorly reconstructed events, and to the small raw yield in that bin. The former arises from the presence of a large number of low momentum pions and a large background. This makes it difficult to select the right pion and results in a larger absolute uncertainty on the fitted yield. The small yield leads to a fairly large unfolding correction in this bin and thus to a considerably reduced unfolded yield. On the other hand, the unfolding process increases the absolute uncertainty only slightly. The reduced yield together with the larger absolute uncertainty lead to the larger relative uncertainties reported in the table.",

Table VIII.The smaller error bars are statistical only while the larger ones also include systematic uncertainties. The solid green and black curves show the result of the fit to the data of the BK [17] and BGL [28] parametrizations, respectively. The data are also compared to unquenched LQCD calculations (HPQCD [2], FNAL [3]) and an LCSR calculation [4]. B(\u03a5(4S) \u2192 B 0 B 0 ) = 0.484 \u00b1 0.006 and B(\u03a5(4S) \u2192 B + B \u2212 ) = 0.516 \u00b1 0.006 [8]. We obtain the total BFs B(B 0 \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 \u2113 + \u03bd) = (1.42 \u00b1 0.05 stat \u00b1 0.07 syst ) \u00d7 10 \u22124 , B(B + \u2192 \u03b7\u2113 + \u03bd) = (0.36 \u00b1 0.05 stat \u00b1 0.04 syst ) \u00d7 10 \u22124 and B(B + \u2192 \u03b7 \u2032 \u2113 + \u03bd) = (0.24 \u00b1 0.08 stat \u00b1 0.03 syst ) \u00d7 10 \u22124 . The BF value for B + \u2192 \u03b7 \u2032 \u2113 + \u03bd has a significance of 3.2\u03c3 when we take into account only the statistical uncertainty [27]. Taking into account the effect of the systematic uncertainty which increases the total uncertainty by about 8% leads to a reduced significance of 3.0\u03c3. The BF value, obtained from a fit to the combined \u03b3\u03b3 and 3\u03c0 channels of the B + \u2192 \u03b7\u2113 + \u03bd decays, is in good agreement with the weighted average of the total BFs obtained separately for the \u03b3\u03b3 and 3\u03c0 channels. Consistent re-sults are obtained when dividing the final data set into chronologically-ordered subsets, electron only and muon only subsets, modifying the q 2 or the \u2206E and m ES binnings, and varying the event selection requirements.",

To allow a direct comparison with the theoretical predictions, which do not include FSR effects, the experimental distributions in these figures have been obtained with the efficiency given by the ratio of q 2 unfolded events generated after all the cuts with a simulation which includes FSR to the total number of events generated before any cut and with no FSR effects i.e. with PHOTOS switched off. We obtain the f + (q 2 ) shape from a fit to these distributions. The \u03c7 2 function minimized in the fit to the f + (q 2 ) shape uses the BGL parametrization [28] consisting of a two-parameter polynomial expansion. For the B 0 \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 \u2113 + \u03bd decays, the fit gives a 1 /a 0 = \u22120.63 \u00b1 0.29 and a 2 /a 0 = \u22126.9 \u00b1 1.7, with P (\u03c7 2 ) = 92.1% as well as a value of |V ub f + (0)| = (8.5 \u00b1 0.3 stat \u00b1 0.2 syst ) \u00d7 10 \u22124 from the fit extrapolated to q 2 = 0. This value can be used to predict rates of other decays such as B \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0 [29]. For completeness, we also show the fit to the BK parametrization [17], which gives \u03b1 BK = 0.52 \u00b1 0.04, with P (\u03c7 2 ) = 28.6%.",

We first normalize the form factor predictions to the experimental data by requiring the integrals of both to be the same over the q 2 ranges of validity given in Table III for each theoretical prediction.

However, there are significant differences between the two analyses. Considering the same fit region, we obtain 147529 selected events (signal or background) compared to 42516 such events in Ref. [14]. This difference can easily be explained by the fact that we use the full BABAR data set in the present analysis but not so in Ref. [14]. Furthermore, the use of the loose neutrino reconstruction technique in this work leads to a larger background. Only 140 events are found in common between the two data sets i.e. 0.3% overlap. The statistical uncertainties are thus expected to be uncorrelated between the two analyses. The event reconstruction and simulation are also somewhat different. For example, the values of q 2 are computed using different, although in princi-  ple equivalent, relations: here, q 2 = (P B \u2212 P \u03c0 ) 2 versus q 2 = (P \u2113 + P \u03bd ) 2 in Ref. [14]. Nevertheless, almost all of the systematic uncertainties are expected to be highly correlated.",

From these distributions, we extract the f + (q 2 ) shapes which are found to be compatible with all three theoretical predictions considered for the B 0 \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 \u2113 + \u03bd decays and with the LCSR calculation for the B + \u2192 \u03b7\u2113 + \u03bd decays. The BGL parametrization fits our data well and allows us to obtain the value of |V ub f + (0)|. Our measured branching fractions of the three decays reported in this work lead to a significant improvement in our knowledge of the composition of the inclusive charmless semileptonic decay rate. Our value of the total BF for B + \u2192 \u03b7 \u2032 \u2113 + \u03bd is an order of magnitude smaller than the most recent CLEO result [9].  [14].

In Table VIII, we have one column for each bin of q 2 , three columns for various ranges of q 2 as well as the last column for the global result. In row 1, \"Fitted yield\", we give the raw fitted yield as number of events. In row 2, \"Yield statistical error\", we give the statistical uncertainty in % for each fitted yield. In row 3, \"Efficiency\", we give the efficiency in % attached to each yield. In row 4, \"Eff. (Without FSR)\", we give the efficiency in %, modified to remove the FSR effect. In row 5, \"Unfolded yield\", we give the yields from row 1 unfolded to give the true values of the yields in each bin, expressed as number of events. In row 6, \"\u2206B\", we give the values of the partial BFs computed as usual using the true (unfolded) yields and the efficiencies with FSR. In row 7, \"\u2206B (Without FSR)\", we give the values of the partial BFs computed as usual using the true (unfolded) yields and the efficiencies modified to remove the FSR effect. In rows 8 -39, we give the contributions in % to the relative systematic uncertainties for each value of \u2206B as a function of q 2 . In row 40, \"Signal MC statistical error\", we give the statistical uncertainty due to the number of MC signal events. In row 41, \"Total systematic error\", we give the total systematic uncertainty in % for each value of \u2206B, obtained as the sum in quadrature of all the systematic uncertainties in each column. In row 42, \"Total statistical error\", we give the statistical uncertainty in % for each value of \u2206B obtained from propagating the statistical uncertainties on the raw fitted yields, following the unfolding process and taking into account the efficiencies. In row 43, \"Total error\", we first give the total uncertainty in % for each value of \u2206B, obtained as the sum in quadrature of the total systematic error and the total statistical error. We then give, in the last four columns, the total uncertainties in % for each range of q 2 , obtained as the sum in quadrature of the total errors for the appropriate number of q 2 bins. A similar description applies to Table IX. In our analysis, we compute the covariance matrix for each source of uncertainty, and use these matrices to calculate the uncertainties on the total BFs. The correlation matrices for the total statistical and systematic uncertainties are given in Table X for the B + \u2192 \u03b7\u2113 + \u03bd yields and in Tables XI and XII for the B 0 \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 \u2113 + \u03bd yields, respectively.
