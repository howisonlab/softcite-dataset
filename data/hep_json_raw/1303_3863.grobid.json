We exclude a zero value for sin 2 2\u03b813 with a significance of 7.7 standard deviations. Electron antineutrinos from six reactors of 2.9 GW th were detected in six antineutrino detectors deployed in two near (fluxweighted baselines of 470 m and 576 m) and one far (1648 m) underground experimental halls. Using 139 days of data, 28909 (205308) electron antineutrino candidates were detected at the far hall (near halls). The ratio of the observed to the expected number of antineutrinos assuming no oscillations at the far hall is 0.944\u00b10.007(stat.)\u00b10.003(syst.). An analysis of the relative rates in six detectors finds sin 2 2\u03b813 =0.089\u00b10.010(stat.)\u00b10.005(syst.) in a three-neutrino framework.",

            "text": "Observations of neutrinos and antineutrinos produced in the sun, the atmosphere, reactors, and from particle beams provide overwhelming evidence that the flavors of neutrinos change (oscillate) [1][2][3][4][5]. The preponderance of data support a three-neutrino framework where three flavor states (\u03bd e , \u03bd \u03bc , \u03bd \u03c4 ) are superpositions of three mass states (\u03bd 1 , \u03bd 2 , \u03bd 3 ). This mixing can be quantified using a unitary 3\u00d73 mixing matrix described in terms of three mixing angles (\u03b8 12 ,\u03b8 23 ,\u03b8 13 ) and a CP violating phase (\u03b4) [6,7]. Neutrino oscillations are also dependent on the differences in the squares of the neutrino masses.",

All six cores are functionally identical pressurized water reactors, each with a maximum of 2.9 GW thermal power [17]. The last core started commercial operation on 7 August 2011. The distance between the cores for each pair is 88 m. The Daya Bay cores are separated from the Ling Ao cores by about 1100 m, while the Ling Ao-II cores are around 500 m away from the Ling Ao cores. Three underground experimental halls (EHs) are connected with horizontal tunnels. For this analysis, two antineutrino detectors (ADs) were located in EH1, one in EH2, and three near the oscillation maximum in EH3 (the far hall).

All distances have been surveyed with the Global Positioning System (GPS) and with modern theodolites utilizing two major control networks built over several months. The network surveyed using GPS is within the campus of the power plant but outside of the tunnel. The other network is inside the tunnel system, surveyed using Total Station, an electronic/optical instrument widely used in modern surveying. The double traverse survey network was laid down in a closed ring in the 7 m wide tunnels. The Total Station survey included the power plant campus to link the two control networks. The survey from the anchors at the entrance of each experimental hall to each AD was completed during the installation of each AD using a laser tracker. The coordinates of the AD center were further deduced using the AD survey data collected during AD assembly. The coordinates of the geometrical center of the reactor cores were provided by the power plant relative to four anchor points outside of each nuclear island. The survey data were processed independently by three groups with different software. The uncertainty of the baselines was determined to be 28 mm as reported in Ref. [8]. Recently another closed traverse survey was completed utilizing a different tunnel entrance and the top of the mountain. The largest baseline difference between the two surveys is 4 mm and the uncertainty in the baselines has been reduced to 18 mm. The uncertainty has seven significant contributions, the largest being 12.6 mm due to the precision of the GPS survey. The second largest is 9.1 mm due to fitting uncertainties associated with the linking of the GPS and the Total Station networks. When combined with the uncertainties of the fission gravity center (described in Sec. 6), the baseline uncertainties were found to make a negligible contribution to the oscillation uncertainties.

The coincidence of the prompt scintillation from the e + and the delayed neutron capture on Gd provides a distinctive \u03bd e signature. The positron carries almost all of the kinetic energy of the antineutrino, thus the positron energy deposited in the liquid scintillator is highly correlated with the antineutrino energy. The neutron thermalizes before being captured on either a proton or a gadolinium nucleus with a mean capture time of \u223c30 \u03bcs in Gd-LS with 0.1% Gd by weight. When a neutron is captured on Gd, it releases several gamma-rays with a total energy of \u223c8 MeV, and is thus easily distinguished from the background coming from natural radioactivity. Only neutrons that were captured on Gd were selected as the delayed signal of an antineutrino event in this analysis.",

The innermost volume holds 20 t of Gd-LS with 0.1% Gd by weight and serves as the antineutrino target. The middle volume is called the gamma catcher and is filled with 20 t of un-doped liquid scintillator (LS) for detecting gamma-rays that escape the target volume. The outer volume contains 37 t of mineral oil (MO) to provide optical homogeneity and to shield the inner volumes from radiation originating, for example, from the photo-multiplier tubes (PMTs) or the stainless steel vessel (SSV). There are 192 20-cm PMTs (Hamamatsu R5912) installed along the circumference of the SSV and within the mineral oil volume, in 24 columns and 8 rings. To improve optical uniformity, the PMTs are recessed in a 3-mm thick black acrylic cylindrical shield located at the equator of the PMT bulb. Three automated calibration units (ACU-A, ACU-B, and ACU-C) are mounted on the top of each SSV as shown in Fig. 2. Each ACU is equipped with an LED, a 68 Ge source, and a combined source of 241 Am-13 C and 60 Co. The Am-C source generates neutrons at a rate of \u223c0.5 Hz. The rates of the 60 Co and 68 Ge sources are about 100 Hz and 15 Hz, respectively. Since the AD is fully submerged in water, the ACUs are operated remotely. The sources can be deployed to better than 011001-4 0.5 cm along a vertical line down to the bottom of the acrylic vessels. When not in use, the LED and sources are retracted into the ACUs that also serve as shielding for the sources.",

The resulting data set (good run data or good run time) was used for analysis. The detector halls operated independently with a common centralized clock and GPS timing system. The analysis presented here required simultaneous operation of all three detector halls, to minimize systematic effects associated with potential reactor power excursions. Simultaneous operation was defined as Physics Data within a given hour existing for all three detector halls. The data samples used in this analysis differed by 1% in time for the three halls.

The distributions for all six ADs agree well for IBD candidates (FID<0); however, there is some variation for flasher candidates (FID>0). For the IBD analysis as well as other analyses, the rejection of flasher events was done at the beginning of the data reduction. The discrimination power decreases for low energy events or events very close to PMTs. For the rejected events with FID \u223c 0, we studied the charge pattern, the energy distribution, the capture time, and the distance between the vertices of the prompt and the delayed signals, and found that some were consistent with real IBD events. By counting such events, the inefficiency of the IBD selection due to the flasher rejection was estimated to be 0.02% with an uncorrelated uncertainty of 0.01%. The background contamination of selected IBD candidates was evaluated to be <10 \u22124 . Furthermore, such contamination was counted as accidental background (Sec. 5.1) and was subtracted. Special runs were conducted with reduced high voltage for selected PMTs to cross-check the identified PMTs that exhibited flashing. Due to the high efficiency of the FID, all AD PMTs were kept in operation, including those identified as flashing PMTs.",

The goal of energy reconstruction was to correct for these dependencies in order to minimize the uncertainties in the AD energy scale. To achieve this goal, each AD was calibrated using LEDs, 68 Ge, and 241 Am-13 C/ 60 Co sources. LEDs were utilized for PMT gain calibration, while the energy calibration parameter (p.e. per MeV) was determined with a 60 Co source deployed at the detector center. The sources were deployed once per week to check and correct for any time dependence. Occasionally a PMT's output was noisy and was temporarily turned off during physics data taking. The energy calibration corrected such situations. The energy calibration parameter for each AD is shown in Fig. 7 as a function of time. The small jumps correspond to the temporary turn-off of noisy PMTs. The energy resolution was (7.5/ E(MeV)+0.9)% for all 6 ADs. A scan along the vertical axis utilizing the 60 Co source from each of the three ACUs was used to obtain non-uniformity correction functions. The non-uniformity was also studied with spallation neutrons generated by cosmic muons, and alphas produced by natural radioactivity present in the liquid scintillator. The neutron energy scale was set by comparing 60 Co events with neutron capture on Gd events from the Am-C source at the detector center. Additional details of energy calibration, reconstruction, and vertex reconstruction can be found in Ref. [15].",

In that regard, only the relative efficiencies and uncorrelated uncertainties matter. Extraction of absolute efficiencies and correlated uncertainties was done in part to better understand our detector, and was a natural consequence of evaluating the uncorrelated uncertainties. Absolute efficiencies associated with the prompt energy, delayed energy, capture time, Gd-capture fraction, and spill-in effects were evaluated with the Monte Carlo. Efficiencies associated with the muon veto, multiplicity cut, and livetime were evaluated using data. In general, the uncorrelated uncertainties were not dependent on the details of our simulation. Table 4 summarizes the absolute efficiencies and the systematic uncertainties. The uncertainties of the absolute efficiencies were correlated among the ADs. No relative efficiency, except the muon veto efficiency \u03bc and the average multiplicity cut efficiency m , were corrected. All differences between the functionally identical ADs were taken as uncorrelated uncertainties. The absolute efficiency of the prompt energy cut (0.7 < E p < 12.0 MeV) was determined to be 99.88%. The energy spectrum is shown in Fig. 9. Inefficiency was mainly caused by interactions inside the inner acrylic vessel, indicated by the vertex distribution of the rejected 011001-9 prompt signal below 0.7 MeV. While the uncertainty in the energy scale is below 0.5% for events at the detector center or uniformly distributed in the target volume, it is larger for events at the edge. The asymmetries of the energy among ADs could be as large as 2% for events at the radius of ACU-C, studied with 60 Co source [15]. Taking 2% uncertainty in the energy scale for events near the inner acrylic vessel, the uncorrelated uncertainty of the efficiency due to the prompt energy cut was evaluated to be 0.01%. Given that the positron threshold was calibrated with the 68 Ge source, the uncertainty of this absolute efficiency comes from the difference of nonlinearity and non-uniformity between the data and MC.

Spill-out is analogous to spill-in, except that IBD neutrons produced within the target volume were captured outside the target volume. By measuring the difference in the neutron capture time of each AD, the relative Gd-concentration variation was constrained and the Gd capture fraction variation was determined to be within 0.1%. By comparing Am-C source data with MC, as well as spallation neutrons, the correlated uncertainty on Gd capture fraction was estimated to be 0.8%. The efficiency of the capture time cut (1 < \u0394t < 200 \u03bcs) was evaluated to be 98.6% with 0.2% of events with \u0394t < 1 \u03bcs and 1.2% events with \u0394t > 200 \u03bcs.

If t off is large enough to avoid real correlated events (such as for IBD, fast neutron (Sec. 5.2), and 9 Li/ 8 He decay (Sec. 5.3)), the accidental backgrounds can be estimated by counting the coincidences in the off-window. To reduce the statistical uncertainty, multiple non-overlapping off-windows were examined. The mean number of selected coincidences in these off-windows was taken as the expected accidental background. The relative differences between the results from the off-window method and the calculations using Eq. 5were consistent given the statistical uncertainties for all six ADs. The accidental background was also validated by comparing the distributions of distance between the reconstructed vertices for the prompt and delayed signals of the IBD candidates and accidentals selected by the offwindow method, as shown in Fig. 13. The prompt and delayed vertices of accidentals were uncorrelated, thus giving a broad distribution, while the two vertices for IBD events were correlated, giving a distribution peaked at a short distance.

The muon samples with and without reduction were both prepared for the 9 Li and 8 He background estimation. The data were sub-divided into six groups in visible muon energy (0.02-0.5, 0.5-1.5, 1.5-2.5, 2.5-3.5, 3.5-4.5, and >4.5 GeV). Taking EH1 as an example, the corresponding muon rates in each energy bin were (10.0, 10.9, 0.23, 0.042, 0.016, 5.6e-3 Hz). Note that the maximum visible energy was around 5 GeV because of the saturation of the PMTs. An example of a fit to the time-since-last muon distribution using Eq. 8for determining the number of 9 Li and 8 He events for E \u03bc >4.5 GeV is shown in Fig. 15. Though only four seconds are shown in the figure, the fit range was actually from 1 ms to 40 s. Fitting over such a large range helped to insure that R \u03bc was accurate. Because of the 1000 \u03bcs \u03bc AD veto, the fitted R \u03bc was slightly smaller than the directly measured value. Instead of allowing the 9 Li to 9 Li plus 8 He ratio to float, we scanned it from 0 to 1 in steps of 0.01. For each scan point, a maximum likelihood fit was done, where only N Li+He , N IBD , and R \u03bc were allowed to float. Also, only the results with a global maximum likelihood among scan points were regarded as best fit values. The global maximum likelihood confirmed that 9 Li was dominant in the 8 He/ 9 Li backgrounds. The binning effect was included in the uncertainty estimation by changing the bin width of the time-since-last muon distribution.",

The measured values agreed with the prediction within statistics. Another check was done by predicting the EH3 9 Li yield assuming that it follows an E 0.74 \u03bc power law, where E \u03bc is the simulated average muon energy (See Table 1), and normalizing to EH1 and EH2 measurements. Again the fitted EH3 9 Li yield agreed with the prediction within statistics.

We identified four sources of alpha decays, the 238 U, 232 Th, 227 Ac decay chains and 210 Po. The decay chains are \u03b2-\u03b1 cascades with half lives of 164.3 \u03bcs, 0.3 \u03bcs, and 1.781 ms, respectively. Fig. 17 displays the correlation of the promptdelayed energy distributions for various time intervals corresponding to these cascade decays: 1-3 \u03bcs at upper left (group A are 212 Bi-212 Po decays from the 232 Th decay chain), 10-160 \u03bcs at upper right (group B are IBD events where the neutron captures on hydrogen. Group C are 214 Bi-214 Po decays from the 238 U decay chain, and group D are 219 Rn-215 Po decays from the 227 Ac decay chain). In the 1-2 ms region at lower left, only group D and some accidental coincidence events remain.  Geant4 was used to model the energy deposition process. Based on the (\u03b1, n) cross sections archived in JENDL [32], the neutron yield as a function of \u03b1 energy was calculated and summed. Finally, with the in-situ measured alpha-decay rates and MC determined neutron yields, the 13 C(\u03b1, n) 16 O rate was calculated, as listed in Table 5. The uncertainties come from the selection efficiencies of the Bi-Po and Rn-Po chain measurements, the possible deviation from equilibrium of the 238 U, 232 Th, and 227 Ac decay chains, the fitting to determine the 210 Po activity, and the simulation of (\u03b1, n) reactions. During the Gd-LS synthesis, 238 U, 232 Th, and Ra were removed by radio-purification. They may contribute \u223c30% of the alphas of the whole chain. Thus a 30% uncertainty was assigned for the possible deviation from equilibrium, which was the largest component in the uncertainties. A 10% uncertainty was assigned to the neutron yield by comparing the MC simulation with an analytical calculation. Together with the other two components, \u223c50% uncertainties were estimated for the (\u03b1, n) backgrounds, slightly different for each AD due to different alpha components in them.",

A complementary core simulation package was developed based on DRAGON [44] as a cross check and for systematic studies. The code was validated with the Takahama-3 benchmark [45] and agrees with the fission fraction provided by the power plant to 3%. Correlations among the four isotopes were studied using the DRAGON-based simulation package, and were in good agreement with the data collected in Ref. [46]. Given the constraints of the thermal power and correlations, the uncertainties of the fission fraction simulation translated into a 0.6% core-to-core uncorrelated uncertainty in the neutrino flux.

Non-equilibrium corrections for long-lived isotopes were applied following Ref. [37]. Contributions from spent fuel [50,51] (\u223c0.3%) were included as an uncertainty. The 3D spatial distribution of the isotopes within a core was also provided by the power plant. Simulation indicated that the spatial distribution has a negligible effect. As such, the reactor core was taken as a point source. The 3D core simulation with the input of the monthly in-core neutron flux measurement showed that the fission gravity center moves less than 1 cm on the horizontal plane and several cm vertically as the fuel burned. The resulting baseline variation can be ignored. Figure 22 presents the background-subtracted and efficiency-corrected IBD rates in the three experimental halls.

Fig. 23 shows the number of IBD candidates in Fig. 23. Ratio of measured versus expected signals in each detector, assuming no oscillation. The error bar is the uncorrelated uncertainty of each AD, including statistical, detector-related, and background-related uncertainties. The expected signal has been corrected with the best-fit normalization parameter. Reactor and survey data were used to compute the flux-weighted average baselines. The oscillation survival probability at the best-fit value is given by the smooth curve. The AD4 and AD6 data points were displaced by -30 and +30 m for visual clarity. The \u03c7 2 value versus sin 2 2\u03b813 is shown in the inset. each detector after correction for relative efficiency and background, relative to those expected assuming no oscillation. A \u223c1.5% oscillation effect appears in the near halls, largely due to oscillation of the antineutrinos from the reactor cores in the farther cluster. The oscillation survival probability at the best-fit values is given by the smooth curve. The \u03c7 2 value versus sin 2 2\u03b8 13 is shown in the inset. The observed \u03bd e spectrum in the far hall was compared to a prediction based on the near hall measurements \u03b1M a +\u03b2M b in Fig. 24. The distortion of the spectra is consistent with that expected due to oscillations at the best-fit \u03b8 13 obtained from the rate-based analysis.",

A total of 138,835, 66,473, and 28,909 electron antineutrino candidates were detected in the Daya Bay near hall, the Ling Ao near hall, and the far hall, respectively. Compared with the prediction based on the near-hall measurements, a deficit of 5.6% was observed in the far hall. The rate-based analysis has yielded sin 2 2\u03b8 13 =0.089\u00b10.010(stat.)\u00b10.005(syst.). This is the most precise measurement of sin 2 2\u03b8 13 to date with a precision of 12.6%, and supersedes our previous measurement [8].
