The results agree with standard model predictions. The invariant mass distribution of the four-lepton system is used to set limits on anomalous ZZZ and ZZ\u03b3 couplings at 95% confidence level: \u2212 0.0012 < f Z 4 < 0.0010, \u2212 0.0010 < f Z 5 < 0.0013, \u2212 0.0012 < f \u03b3 4 < 0.0013, \u2212 0.0012 < f \u03b3 5 < 0.0013.",

            "text": "Measurements of diboson production at the CERN LHC allow precision tests of the standard model (SM). In the SM, ZZ production proceeds mainly through quark-antiquark tand u-channel scattering diagrams. In calculations at higher orders in quantum chromodynamics (QCD), gluon-gluon fusion also contributes via box diagrams with quark loops. There are no tree-level contributions to ZZ production from triple gauge boson vertices in the SM. Anomalous triple gauge couplings (aTGC) could be induced by new physics models such as supersymmetry [1]. Nonzero aTGCs may be e-mail: cms-publication-committee-chair@cern.ch parametrized using an effective Lagrangian as in Ref. [2]. In this formalism, two ZZZ and two ZZ\u03b3 couplings are allowed by electromagnetic gauge invariance and Lorentz invariance for on-shell Z bosons. These are described by two CP-violating ( f V 4 ) and two CP-conserving ( f V 5 ) parameters, where V = Z or \u03b3 .",

            "text": "Previous measurements of the ZZ production cross section by the CMS Collaboration were performed for pairs of on-shell Z bosons, produced in the dilepton mass range 60-120 GeV [3-6]. These measurements were made with data sets corresponding to integrated luminosities of 5.1 fb \u22121 at \u221a s = 7 TeV and 19.6 fb \u22121 at \u221a s = 8 TeV in the ZZ \u2192 2 2 and ZZ \u2192 2 2\u03bd decay channels, where = e or \u03bc and = e, \u03bc, or \u03c4 , and with an integrated luminosity of 2.6 fb \u22121 at \u221a s = 13 TeV in the ZZ \u2192 2 2 decay channel, where = e or \u03bc. All of them agree with SM predictions. The ATLAS Collaboration produced similar results at \u221a s = 7, 8, and 13 TeV [7-10], which also agree with the SM. These measurements are important for testing predictions that were recently made available at next-to-nextto-leading order (NNLO) in QCD [11]. Comparing these predictions with data at a range of center-of-mass energies provides information about the electroweak gauge sector of the SM. Because the uncertainty of the CMS measurement at \u221a s = 13 TeV [6] was dominated by the statistical uncertainty of the observed data, repeating and extending the measurement with a larger sample of proton-proton collision data at \u221a s = 13 TeV improves the precision of the results. The most stringent previous limits on ZZZ and ZZ\u03b3 aTGCs from CMS were set using the 7 and 8 TeV data samples: \u2212 0.0022 < f Z 4 < 0.0026, \u2212 0.0023 < f Z 5 < 0.0023, \u2212 0.0029 < f \u03b3 4 < 0.0026, and \u2212 0.0026 < f \u03b3 5 < 0.0027 at 95% confidence level (CL) [4,5]. Similar limits were obtained by the ATLAS Collaboration [12], who also recently produced limits using 13 TeV data [10].",

The misidentification probability for each lepton flavor, measured in bins of lepton candidate p T and \u03b7, is defined as the ratio of the number of candidates that pass the final isolation and identification requirements to the total number in the sample. The number of Z + candidate events is corrected for the contamination from WZ production and ZZ production in which one lepton is not reconstructed. These events have a third genuine, isolated lepton that must be excluded from the misidentification probability calculation. The WZ contamination is suppressed by requiring the missing transverse momentum p miss T to be below 25 GeV. The p miss T is defined as the magnitude of the missing transverse momentum vector p miss T , the projection onto the plane transverse to the beams of the negative vector sum of the momenta of all reconstructed PF candidates in the event, corrected for the jet energy scale. Additionally, the transverse mass calculated with p miss T and the",

Both are defined to contain events with a dilepton candidate satisfying all requirements (Z 1 ) and two additional lepton candidates + \u2212 . In one control sample, enriched in WZ events, one candidate is required to satisfy the full identification and isolation criteria and the other must fail the full criteria and instead satisfy only the relaxed ones; in the other, enriched in Z+jets events, both candi-dates must satisfy the relaxed criteria, but fail the full criteria. The additional leptons must have opposite charge and the same flavor (e \u00b1 e \u2213 , \u03bc \u00b1 \u03bc \u2213 ). From this set of events, the expected number of background events in the signal region, denoted \"Z + X\" in the figures, is obtained by scaling the number of observed Z 1 + + \u2212 events by the misidentification probability for each lepton failing the selection. It is found to be approximately 4% of the total expected yield. The procedure is described in more detail in Ref. [45].",

These uncertainties are higher for Z \u2192 4 events because the leptons generally have lower p T , and the samples used in the tag-and-probe method have fewer events and more contamination from nonprompt leptons in this lowp T region. Uncertainties due to the effect of factorization (\u03bc F ) and renormalization (\u03bc R ) scale choices on the ZZ \u2192 4 acceptance are evaluated with powheg and mcfm by varying the scales up and down by a factor of two with respect to the default values \u03bc F = \u03bc R = m ZZ .

The measured signal is obtained from a comparison of the data to a grid of aTGC models in the ( f Z 4 , f Expected signal values are interpolated between the 2D grid points using a second-degree polynomial, since the cross section for the signal depends quadratically on the coupling parameters. A binned profile likelihood method, Wald Gaussian approximation, and Wilk's theorem are used to derive one-dimensional limits at a 95% confidence level (CL) on each of the four aTGC parameters, and two-dimensional limits at a 95% CL on the pairs ( f Z 4 , f \u03b3 4 ) and ( f Z 5 , f \u03b3 5 ) [46,54,55]. When the limits are calculated for each parameter or pair, all other parameters are set to their SM values. The systematic uncertainties described in Sect. 7 are treated as nuisance parameters with log-normal distributions. No form factor is used when deriving the limits so that the results do not depend on any assumed energy scale characterizing new physics.
