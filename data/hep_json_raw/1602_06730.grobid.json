Three distributions are introduced that show very weak dependence on neutrino flux and its associated uncertainty. Measurements comparing these distributions between quasi-elastic-like and single charged pion final states will provide new constraints of nuclear effects. It is suggested that the on-axis position in the NuMI beam provides the correct flux to take advantage of this reduced energy dependence in measuring nuclear effect-generated transverse imbalances.",

Using nuclear targets, as opposed to free nucleon targets, obfuscates the neutrino interaction and imparts significant uncertainties and model dependencies onto the reconstructed neutrino energy. Current neutrino beams are wide-band and the spread in event-byevent neutrino energy is significant, thereby making the impact of nuclear effects difficult to isolate. Understanding the hadronic system is key for investigations of nuclear effects; it holds all available information about the type of interaction that occurred.",

For RES interactions, hadronic mass cuts that isolate single pion production via a delta resonance are frequently used, e.g. in MINERvA charged current single pion production [9]. This results in a hadronic mass distributed about 1.2 GeV. The initial state nucleon momentum distribution is separate from the neutrino interaction. The only remaining unknown is Q 2 . As discussed, above some threshold energy, Q 2 is largely independent of the neutrino energy. Therefore, in an appropriate neutrino beam, the event-by-event energy transfer to the hadronic system should be largely decoupled from the neutrino energy. The on-axis position in the NuMI beam has a peak energy high enough to cause such decoupling for QE and for RES events. The following discussions focus on NuWro predicted event rate shapes for a carbon target exposed to the NuMI on-axis muon neutrino flux.

(left): Pauli blocking (PB) suppresses events at low p \u2113 T and high \u03b4\u03b1 T because in this region a low three momentum transfer would act against the nucleon Fermi motion leaving it in a disallowed final state. (top right): The high \u03b4\u03b1 T event suppression is due to Pauli blocking and acts against the effects of FSIs at low p \u2113 T . (below right): p \u2113 T slice-normalised event rate in \u03b4\u03b1 T and p \u2113 T . With Pauli blocking effects and FSIs removed from the simulation \u03b4\u03b1 T is very flat in p \u2113 T .",

To this end, code was written to allow conversion from the native GiBUU and NEUT outputs to the so-called rootracker output-both NuWro and GENIE already come with bundled software that can output in this format. Further more the rootracker event vectors were further processed into ROOT-based analysis files. All of the code is open source and available upon request. Discussions of designing a better event format than rootracker are very welcome.",
