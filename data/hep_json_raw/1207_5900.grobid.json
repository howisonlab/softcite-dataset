The model is motivated by the Tevatron results on the forward-backward asymmetry of tt pair production. In the evaluation of the theoretical cross section of pp \u2192 ttj, the interference effect between the SM and W \u2032 amplitudes is shown to be important, though it is ignored in the CMS analysis. The lower mass bound on the W \u2032 boson is relaxed from 840 GeV to 740 GeV at the 95% C.L. due to the interference effect. The bound is also compared to the top forward-backward asymmetry.",

They used a theoretical cross section at the leading order (LO), referring to Ref. [8].

We reproduced the referred cross section in the CMS paper by ignoring the interference effect, which is shown by the red-dotted line in Fig. 3. Based on the analysis, they put a limit of m W \u2032 > 840 GeV at the 95% C.L. if the W \u2032 coupling is fixed to be g R = 2. However, including the interference effect, the cross section reduces as shown in Fig. 3  Let us investigate the interference effect. In Tab. 1, the cross sections are shown for two benchmark points of (m W \u2032 , g R ). For the process gd \u2192 ttd, the interference term is subleading compared to the total W \u2032 contribution. Especially when g R is small, the s-channel production of the W \u2032 boson dominates. On the other hand, since the process dd \u2192 ttg has a sizable SM contribution, the interference effect is enhanced. Since the effect works destructive, focusing on the s-channel W \u2032 production would be a good choice to increase the signal-to-background ratio, which can be done with a cut on the invariant mass of the jet and thet-quark. With the cut the first two diagrams of Fig. 1 mainly contributes, and destructive interference in dd \u2192 ttg events would be ignorable.",

            "text": "Tevatron results. Finally, let us comment on the acceptance and the QCD corrections. The acceptance depends on the jet distributions in the detectors. The interference effect changes the relative size of each contribution, which could affect the acceptance. According to the CMS analysis [7], this seems more important for heavier W \u2032 . Moreover, the top FB asymmetry at the parton level also depends on the acceptance at the CDF and D0 detectors [14][15][16]. Since the corrections are not included in this note, the full detector analysis is required. Next, the QCD correction is not considered for the evaluation of the top FB asymmetry. The NLO correction to the W \u2032 contribution can increase the asymmetry by about 10% [17]. Nonetheless, the CMS bound on the tt+jet event provides a crucial constraint on A FB in the flavor-changing W \u2032 model. Also as discussed above, focusing on s-channel W \u2032 production is considered to feature the signal. The authors are eager for the CMS to update the analysis with the interference effect between the SM and W \u2032 amplitudes.",
