In particular, they have been proposed as signatures of supersymmetry (SUSY) [1][2][3], universal extra dimensions [4], pair production of T 5/3 (a fermionic partner of the top quark) [5], heavy Majorana neutrinos [6], and same-sign top-pair resonances as predicted in theories with warped extra dimensions [7]. In this paper we describe searches for new physics with same-sign isolated dileptons (ee, e\u00b5, \u00b5\u00b5, e\u03c4 , \u00b5\u03c4 , and \u03c4 \u03c4 ), missing transverse energy (E miss T ), and hadronic jets. Our choice of signal regions is driven by two simple observations. First, astrophysical evidence for dark matter [8] suggests that we concentrate on final states with E miss T . Second, observable new physics signals with large cross sections are -1 -",

Section 4 describes our search regions. We perform separate searches based on leptonic and hadronic triggers in order to cover a wider region in the parameter space of new physics. Electron and muon triggers allow for searches that require less hadronic energy in the event, while hadronic triggers allow inclusion of lower transverse momentum (p T ) electrons and muons, as well as hadronic \u03c4 decays in the final state. The dominant backgrounds for all three searches are estimated from data, as discussed in section 5. Systematic uncertainties on the predicted number of signal events and results of these searches are discussed in sections 6 and 7. We conclude with a discussion on how to use our results to constrain a wide variety of new physics models in section 8.",

The polar angle \u03b8 is measured from the positive z-axis and the azimuthal angle \u03c6 is measured in the xy plane. The pseudorapidity is defined as \u03b7 = \u2212 ln [tan ( \u03b8 2 )]. The central feature of the CMS apparatus is a superconducting solenoid, of 6 m internal diameter, 13 m in length, providing an axial field of 3.8 T. Within the field volume are several particle detection systems which each feature a cylindrical geometry, covering the full azimuthal range from 0 \u2264 \u03c6 \u2264 2\u03c0. Silicon pixel and strip tracking detectors provide measurements of charged particle trajectories and extend to a pseudorapidity of |\u03b7| = 2.5. A homogeneous crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) and a sampling brass/scintilator hadronic calorimeter (HCAL) surround the tracking volume and provide energy measurements of electrons, photons, and hadronic jets up to |\u03b7| = 3.0. An ironquartz fiber hadronic calorimeter, which is also part of the HCAL system, is located in the forward region defined by 3.0 < |\u03b7| < 5.0. Muons are measured in the pseudorapidity range of |\u03b7| < 2.4, with detection planes made of three technologies: drift tubes, cathode strip chambers, and resistive plate chambers. These are instrumented outside of the magnet coil within the steel return yoke. The CMS detector is nearly hermetic, allowing for energy balance measurements in the plane transverse to the beam direction. A two-tier trigger system is designed to select the most interesting pp collision events for use in physics analysis. A detailed description of the CMS detector can be found elsewhere [9].",

The leptonic triggers allow for lower H T requirements, while the H T triggers allow for lower lepton p T , as well as final states with hadronic \u03c4 decays. The motivation for covering the widest possible phase space in this search can be illustrated by an example of a SUSY cascade, shown in figure 1, naturally giving rise to jets, E miss T , and same-sign leptons: (gluinos/squarks) \u2192 (charged gaugino) \u2192 (lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) neutralino). The mass difference between the gluino/squarks and the charged gaugino, typically arbitrary, defines the amount of hadronic activity one may expect in the event. The mass difference between the gaugino and a neutralino influences the lepton p T spectrum. Depending on the nature of the chargino and neutralino, their mass difference can be either arbitrary (e.g., wino and bino) or typically small (e.g., higgsinos). Moreover, there are a number of ways to generate a large production asymmetry between \u03c4 and e/\u00b5 leptons, which motivates us to look specifically for events with a \u03c4 .",

            "text": "In the following we describe the search regions explored by each trigger strategy. As a new-physics reference point, we use LM0, a point in the constrained Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (CMSSM) [20] defined with the model parameters m 0 = 200 GeV, m 1/2 = 160 GeV, tan\u03b2 = 10, \u00b5 > 0, and A 0 = \u2212400 GeV. LM0 is one of the common CMSSM reference points used in CMS across many analyses. As the abbreviation suggests, LM0 provides squarks and gluinos with relatively low masses, and thus has a large production cross section. It is beyond the exclusion reach of the searches performed by LEP and Tevatron, but it has recently been excluded by searches [21][22][23] with ATLAS and CMS concurrently with this one. Nonetheless, we continue to use LM0 as it provides a common model for which to compare our sensitivity with that of other analyses. Aside from the LM0 point, several SM simulation samples are used to both validate and complement various background estimation methods that are based on the data itself. These samples rely on either PYTHIA 6.4 [24] or MADGRAPH [25] for event generation and GEANT4 [26] for simulation of the CMS detector. Samples used include tt, single-t, \u03b3+jets, W+jets, Z+jets, WW, WZ, ZZ, and QCD multijet production. Next-to-leading-order (NLO) cross sections are used for all samples except for QCD multijet production.",

The resulting reweighted RelIso distributions for these three samples are overlaid in figure 6 for muons (left) and electrons (right). The plots show distributions for tt simulation (red crosses) after all selections except RelIso on one of the two leptons, reweighted bb simulation (grey shade), and reweighted bb-enriched data (black dots). The agreement between the two simulation-based distributions validates the method. Agreement between data and simulation is observed but is not required for this method to be valid. The contents of the first bin of the two data plots are the above mentioned isolation selection efficiencies \u01eb e iso = 0.036 +0.013 \u22120.008 , with uncertainties due to statistics only. We probed four different potential sources of systematic uncertainties in the BTag-andprobe method, and added their contributions in quadrature to arrive at a total systematic uncertainty on the \u01eb (b) iso efficiency of 54 (29)% for electrons (muons). The largest contribution to this uncertainty is due to the statistical precision with which the method in simulation is verified. Other potential sources of systematic errors were found to give subdominant contributions. We evaluated the sensitivity of the measured \u01eb iso to the choice of the H T requirement in the range from 100 to 150 GeV, when selecting the bb control sample in data. We allowed the W+jets contribution to the event count in the single fake control region to be twice as large as predicted from MC, with an \u01eb (b) iso half/double of the one measured in the bb control sample. Finally, we used the MC to estimate the change in \u01eb iso for different b-purities of the bb control sample. We then multiply the sideband yield in each of the four channels \u00b5\u00b5, ee, e\u00b5, and \u00b5e by the appropriate factor \u01eb",

In simulation the contribution of LM0 represents less than 4% of events with two same-sign isolated leptons and H T > 150 GeV. Table 1 presents both of these validations of the background estimation technique. We find good agreement between the observation and prediction in all channels in data and in the simulation. The largest source of systematic uncertainties in the prediction of background events is due to lack of statistics of simulated events to validate the method (30%). In addition, we find uncertainties of 18%, 8% and 7% in \u03c4 h \u03c4 h , e\u03c4 h , and \u00b5\u03c4 h , respectively, due to the correlation of \u01eb T L with H T .

This scale uncertainty limits our understanding of the efficiency of the H T and E miss T requirements. Clearly, final states where the typical H T and E miss T are large compared to the selection values used in the analysis are less affected than those with smaller H T and E miss T . We compute the systematic uncertainty due to this effect for the LM0 benchmark point with the four signal selections using the method of ref. [27]. We use the LM0 model as it is typical of the possible SUSY final states to which these analyses are sensitive. We find that the uncertainty varies between 1% at H T > 60 GeV and 7% at H T > 350 GeV, the values of H T used in the selections for the lepton-triggered baseline and \u03c4 h search respectively.",

The H T variable can be approximated by defining it as the scalar sum of the p T of all final-state quarks (u, d, c, s, and b) and gluons with p T > 30 GeV produced in the hard-scattering process. The E miss T can be defined as the magnitude of the vector sum of the transverse momentum over all non-interacting particles, e.g., neutrinos and LSP. The ratio of the mean detector responses for H T and E miss T as defined above, to their true values are 0.94 \u00b1 0.05, and 0.95 \u00b1 0.05, respectively, where the uncertainties are dominated by the jet energy scale uncertainty. The resolution on these two quantities differs for the different selections. In addition, the E miss T resolution depends on the total hadronic activity in the event. It ranges from about 7 to 25 GeV for events with H T in the range of 60 to 350 GeV. The H T resolution decreases from about 26% at 200 GeV to 19% for 300 GeV and to 18% for 350 GeV.

The number of charged particles at the generator level after fragmentation and hadronization is a good measure of the first of these two effects, and has been shown to agree reasonably well between data and simulation [35]. We find that the isolation efficiency reduces roughly linearly -   Figure 9. Electron, muon (left) and \u03c4 h (right) selection efficiencies as a function of p T . The results of the fits described in the text are shown by the dotted lines. by 10% for every 15 charged particles with p T > 3 GeV within the detector acceptance. This was studied using Drell-Yan and LM0 simulation, and compared with Z \u2192 \u2113 + \u2113 \u2212 data. The linearity was thus shown to be valid within a range of charged multiplicities from about 10 to 40. The LM0 reference model shown in figure 9 has an average charged multiplicity of \u223c 25 for events that pass our selections. To arrive at the lepton efficiency for a new physics model with an average charged multiplicity of \u223c 40, one would take the efficiency parametrization depicted in figure 9 and multiply it by 0.9 to account for the 10% change in isolation efficiency due to the larger average charged multiplicity. The second effect, i.e., topologies as in boosted top quarks, is difficult to model at generator level, as the isolation efficiency may vary by an order of magnitude or more in extreme cases. Our results are thus not easily interpretable in new physics models with such characteristics without a detailed detector simulation.",

The specific limit shown here corresponds to the leptonic trigger result with E miss T > 80 GeV for the purpose of illustration. The contour separates the bottom-left region where the expected event yield would be larger than the observed limit of 3.1 events (see table 2, first row, last column) from the top-right region where such expected yield would be lower.",

The excluded regions from LEP are based on searches for sleptons and charginos [42][43][44][45][46]. Other final states, especially the all-hadronic [22], are better suited for this standard reference model, while the leptonic same-sign final state explored in this paper is more appropriate to constrain a wide variety of other new physics models [1][2][3][4][5][6][7]. As discussed in section 4, in a general supersymmetry context, one might expect gluino-gluino or gluino-squark production to lead to same-sign dilepton events via a decay chain involving a chargino. The salient, and very generic feature here is one lepton per gluino with either sign being equally likely. As a result, 50% of the dilepton events will be same-sign. Moreover, these cascade decays are typically characterized by two mass difference scales that separately determine typical H T and lepton JHEP06 (2011)077p T values. Different models of new physics may thus populate only one or the other of our different search regions.",

The \u03c4 h leptons referred to here are reconstructed via their hadronic decays. The dominant background processes in all final states except \u03c4 h \u03c4 h involve events with one fake lepton. In the \u03c4 h \u03c4 h final state, events with two fake \u03c4 h dominate. We have presented methods to derive background estimates from the data for all major background sources. We have set 95% CL upper limits on the number of signal events within |\u03b7| < 2.4 at 35 pb \u22121 in the range of 3.1 to 4.5 events, depending on signal region, and have presented details on signal efficiencies that can be used to confront a wide variety of models of new physics.
