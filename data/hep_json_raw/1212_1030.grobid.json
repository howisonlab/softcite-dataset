HARP measurements have already been used for predictions of neutrino beams in K2K and Mini-BooNE/SciBooNE experiments and are also being used to improve the atmospheric neutrino flux predictions and to help in the optimization of neutrino factory and super-beam designs. First measurements released recently by the NA61/SHINE experiment are of significant importance for a precise prediction of the J-PARC neutrino beam used for the T2K experiment. Both HARP and NA61/SHINE experiments provide also a large amount of input for validation and tuning of hadron production models in Monte-Carlo generators.",

The main motivations are the measurement of pion yields for a quantitative design of the proton driver of a future neutrino factory and a super-beam [2], a substantial improvement in the calculation of the atmospheric neutrino flux [3] and the measurement of particle yields as input for the flux calculation in accelerator neutrino experiments [4], such as K2K [5,6], MiniBooNE [7] and SciBooNE [8]. In addition to these specific aims, the data provided by HARP are valuable for validation and tuning of hadron production models used in simulation programs. The HARP experiment is described in more detail below in order to illustrate some common features of modern hadron production experiments.",

The large-angle spectrometer -based on a Time Projection Chamber (TPC) located inside a solenoidal magnet -has a large acceptance in the momentum and angular range for the pions relevant to the production of the muons in a neutrino factory. It covers the large majority of the pions accepted in the focusing system of a typical design. The neutrino beam of a neutrino factory originates from the decay of muons which are in turn the decay products of pions.",

These measurements are important for a precise calculation of the atmospheric neutrino flux [3] and for a prediction of the development of extended air showers. Simulations predict that collisions of protons with a carbon target are very similar to proton interactions with air. This hypothesis could be directly tested with the HARP data. Measurements with cryogenic O 2 and N 2 targets [15], also shown in Fig. 1, confirm that p-C data can indeed be used to predict pion production in p-O 2 and p-N 2 interactions.",

Similar results were also obtained for incoming protons [22]. Moreover, results on forward proton production in p-A and \u03c0 \u00b1 -A interactions were published recently [23]. The advantage of all these measurements is that they were performed with the same detector, thus related systematic uncertainties are minimized. First results on the measurements of the doubledifferential cross-section for the production of charged pions in p-A collisions emitted at large angles from the incoming beam direction were obtained for the full set of available nuclear targets using an initial part of the accelerator spill to avoid distortions in the TPC [17,18,19]. The pions were produced by proton beams in a momentum range from 3 GeV/c to 12 GeV/c hitting a target with a thickness of 5% \u03bb I . The angular and momentum range covered by the experiment (100 MeV/c \u2264 p < 800 MeV/c and 0.35 rad \u2264 \u03b8 < 2.15 rad) is of particular importance for the design of a neutrino factory. Track recognition, momentum determination and particle identification were all performed based on the measurements made with the TPC (see [17] for more details).",

The main components of the current detector were constructed and used by the NA49 experiment [40]. The main tracking devices are four large volume TPCs. Two of them, the vertex TPCs (VTPC-1 and VTPC-2), are located in the magnetic field of two super-conducting dipole magnets (maximum bending power of 9 Tm) and two others (MTPC-L and MTPC-R) are positioned downstream of the magnets symmetrically with respect to the beam line. One additional small TPC, the so-called gap TPC (GTPC), is installed on the beam axis between the vertex TPCs. The setup is supplemented by time of flight detector arrays two of which (ToF-L/R) were inherited from NA49 and can provide a time measurement resolution of \u03c3 to f \u2264 90 ps. A new forward time of flight detector (ToF-F) with a time resolution of \u223c120 ps was constructed in order to extend the acceptance of the NA61/SHINE setup for pion and kaon identification as required for the T2K measurements. The particle identification in NA61 is based on the differential energy loss dE/dx measured in the TPCs combined with the mass squared measurements based on the ToF information, see Fig. 4. Two carbon (isotropic graphite) targets were used for T2K-related measurements: 1) a 2 cm-long target (about 4% \u03bb I ) with density \u03c1 = 1.84 g/cm 3 , the so-called thin target; 2) a 90 cm long cylinder of 2.6 cm diameter (about 1.9 \u03bb I ), the so-called T2K replica target with density \u03c1 = 1.83 g/cm 3 .",

Models that have been frequently used for the interpretation of cosmic ray data, i.e. VENUS4.12 [48], FLUKA2008 [32] and URQMD1.3.1 [49] were selected. They are part of the CORSIKA [50] framework for the simulation of air showers and are typically used to generate hadron-air interactions at energies below 80 GeV. In order to ensure that all relevant settings of the generators are identical to the ones used in air shower simulations, p-C interactions at 31 GeV/c were simulated within CORSIKA in the so-called interaction test mode. The results are presented in Fig. 5. More model comparisons can be found in the technical notes [51]. Recently, the to f \u2212 dE/dx analysis was applied to the same set of 2007 data in order to perform measurements of differential production cross sections of positively charged kaons in p+C interactions at 31 GeV/c [42].

It demonstrates that high-quality long-target data were successfully taken with the NA61/SHINE apparatus for T2K, and that such data can effectively be used to constrain the T2K neutrino flux predictions. A comparison of neutrino flux predictions based on thin-target hadron production measurements and long-target hadron emission measurements was performed as an illustration of the complete procedure, see Fig. 8. A very good agreement between these two complementary approaches is observed. It is important to stress that this is the first complete example of application of long-target data for neutrino flux predictions.",
