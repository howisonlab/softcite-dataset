Correlations of charged hadrons of 0.7 < pT < 10 GeV/c with \u03c0 0 mesons of 4 < pT < 15 GeV/c or isolated direct photons of 7 < pT < 15 GeV/c are used to study nonperturbative effects generated by initial-state partonic transverse momentum and final-state transverse momentum from fragmentation. The nonperturbative behavior is characterized by measuring the out-of-plane transverse momentum component pout perpendicular to the axis of the trigger particle, which is the high-pT direct photon or \u03c0 0 . Nonperturbative evolution effects are extracted from Gaussian fits to the away-side inclusive-charged-hadron yields for different trigger-particle transverse momenta (p trig T ). The Gaussian widths and root mean square of pout are reported as a function of the interaction hard scale p trig T to investigate possible transverse-momentum-dependent evolution differences between the \u03c0 0 -h \u00b1 and direct photon-h \u00b1 correlations and factorization breaking effects. The widths are found to decrease with p trig T , which indicates that the Collins-Soper-Sterman soft factor is not driving the evolution with the hard scale in nearly back-to-back dihadron and direct photonhadron production in p+p collisions. This behavior is in contrast to Drell-Yan and semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering measurements.",

            "text": "In the last two decades, the study of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) bound states has evolved from static, onedimensional snapshots of quarks and gluons to focus on multidimensional structure and the dynamics of partons. The theoretical framework that has been developed to describe parton dynamics in hadrons involves transverse-momentumdependent (TMD) parton distribution functions (PDFs) and fragmentation functions (FFs). In traditional collinear PDFs and FFs, any momentum of the partons transverse to the hadron boost axis is integrated over. In TMD PDFs or FFs, the transverse momentum of the partons is not integrated out and instead remains explicit in the PDF or FF, offering a means of describing the transverse momentum distribution of unpolarized partons within an unpolarized hadron, as well as a variety of spin-momentum correlations when polarized hadrons and/or partons are considered.",

However, some theoretical details regarding the definition of TMD PDFs within a perturbative QCD (pQCD) framework have only been clarified in the last five years [7]. We note that due to confinement, the behavior of partons within hadrons is nonperturbative in that it cannot be calculated theoretically within pQCD. Collinear or TMD PDFs are nonperturbative functions that can be constrained by and/or used to predict high-energy scattering processes within a pQCD framework. In such a framework, the nonperturbative functions such as PDFs as well as FFs factorize from the perturbatively calculable partonic hard scattering cross section and from each other. Lattice QCD offers an alternative, complementary approach to pQCD, performing numerical nonperturbative calculations directly. In the past lattice QCD could only calculate moments of PDFs, integrated over parton collinear momentum fraction x as well as parton transverse momentum. However, recent developments have demonstrated the potential to go beyond these limitations. These efforts are still in very early stages [8][9][10].",

In particular, the role of color interactions due to soft gluon exchanges with the remnants of the hard scattering have become clearer. Because TMD functions preserve more nonperturbative information compared to collinear functions, TMD functions can differ from collinear ones with regards to universality and factorization. For example, the Sivers TMD PDF [4], a correlation between the proton spin and quark transverse momentum, was shown to possibly be nonzero due to phase interference effects from soft gluon exchanges in SIDIS [25,26]. Shortly afterward, Ref. [27] showed that, due to the gauge invariant nature of QCD and the parity and time (PT) odd nature of the Sivers TMD PDF, the function should be the same magnitude but opposite in sign when measured in Drell-Yan vs. SIDIS processes because of the different color flows possible in the initial state vs. final state. Twist-2 TMD PDFs that involve one polarization vector are odd under PT transformations, leading to this predicted effect. The nonvanishing nature of the Sivers function has already been measured in polarized SIDIS [11]; there is not yet a measurement of this function in polarized Drell-Yan. A first indication from the Drell-Yan like W boson production exists [16]. The results favor a sign-change if TMD evolution effects are small, but at this stage the error bars are still large enough that a definitive statement can not be drawn from this single measurement. It is only for the TMD PDFs odd under PT transformations, where such sign-change behavior is expected, that gluon exchanges cannot be completely eliminated via a gauge transformation.",

In such processes, factorization breaking has been predicted [28][29][30][31] in both polarized and unpolarized interactions. Here the nonperturbative objects in the cross section become correlated with one another and cannot be factorized into a convolution of TMD PDFs or TMD FFs. However, there are no theoretical claims that the perturbative partonic cross section does not factorize from the nonperturbative physics. Similarly to the case of the TMD PDFs that are odd under PT transformations, gluon exchanges that lead to the predicted factorization breaking cannot be eliminated via a gauge transformation. It is important to recognize that the ideas behind the predicted sign change of certain TMD PDFs and factorization breaking represent a major qualitative departure from previous purely perturbative approaches that do not account for soft gluon exchanges with remnants of the hard scattering. Possibly related effects known as \"color coherence\" have been studied and observed in multijet states in hadronic collisions [32][33][34], but these types of effects have not been rigorously treated in a TMD framework.",

            "text": "In calculations of TMD processes where factorization is predicted to hold, the evolution with the hard scale of the interaction is known to be governed by the Collins-Soper (CS) evolution equation [1,2]. Note that the CS evolution equation comes directly out of the derivation of TMD factorization [35]. In contrast to the DGLAP collinear evolution equations [36][37][38], which are purely perturbative, the kernel for the CS evolution equation for TMD processes involves the Collins-Soper-Sterman (CSS) soft factor [3], which generally contains nonperturbative contributions. The soft factor is understood to be strongly universal, the same for unpolarized and polarized processes, PDFs and FFs, with the only difference being between quarks and gluons [39]. Because lattice calculations of the soft factor are currently not possible, the soft factor must be extracted from parameterizations of experimental measurements within a pQCD framework. For a discussion of the CSS soft factor and TMD evolution phenomenology, see Ref. [39]. The theoretical expectation from CSS evolution is that any momentum width sensitive to nonperturbative k T would grow as the hard scale increases. This can be understood intuitively as a broadening of the phase space for gluon radiation with increasing hard scale. In addition this has been studied and observed in multiple phenomenological analyses of Drell-Yan and Z boson data (see e.g. [40][41][42]), as well as phenomenological analyses of SIDIS data, where factorization is also predicted to hold (see e.g. [42][43][44]). As mentioned above, because the CS evolution equation comes directly out of the derivation of TMD factorization, it then follows that a promising avenue to investigate factorization breaking effects is by looking for qualitative differences from CSS evolution in processes where factorization breaking is expected, such as nearly back-to-back dihadron correlations produced in p+p collisions.",

            "text": "To have sensitivity to possible factorization breaking and modified TMD evolution effects, a particular observable must be sensitive to a small scale on the order of \u039b QCD and measured over a range of hard scales. Nearly back-to-back dihadron production has long been used as a proxy for measuring initial-state partonic transverse momentum k T [45][46][47][48], which is defined in Fig. 1. First used in predictions by Ref. [49] as a method for understanding large differences in hard scattering cross sections between theory and data, nearly back-to-back two-particle and dijet angular correlations have since been used to measure k T over a large range of center of mass energies [45,47,50,51]. Direct photon-hadron correlations are of particular interest because the photon comes directly from the partonic hard scattering, and thus carries initial-state information without any final-state fragmentation effects. The direct photon approximates the away-side jet energy at leading order (LO) while still being directly sensitive to the partonic transverse momentum scale. Direct photons also give an interesting comparison to dihadron production because they do not carry color charge, thus, assuming factorization holds, only two TMD PDFs and one TMD FF are necessary in the cross section calculation compared to two TMD PDFs and two TMD FFs in dihadron production. Therefore, there should be more avenues for gluon exchange in nearly back-to-back dihadron events when compared to direct photon-hadron events. Figure 1 shows the hard scattering kinematics of a nearly back-to-back dihadron event in the transverse plane. The effect of initial-state k T and final-state j T , the transverse momentum of the hadron with respect to the jet axis, can be probed in hadronic collisions by measuring the out-of-plane momentum component p out with respect to the near-side hadron or direct photon, collectively referred to as the trigger particle. p out thus quantifies the acoplanarity of the two-particle pair, with p out = 0 signifying exactly back-to-back particle production. Using the trigger particle as a proxy for the jet, the 1-dimensional quantity p out is transverse to the p T of the trigger particle, p trig T , and has a magnitude of:",

Observables of interest are final states where at least one particle has a large p T , defining a hard scale, at least one final-state hadron is measured, and the observable is also sensitive to initial-and final-state k T and j T . At RHIC energies, the p T reach for direct photons and pions is sufficiently large to have separation from the nonperturbative momentum scale. Direct photon-hadron and \u03c0 0 -hadron correlations were chosen specifically because of experimental capabilities and because of the differing number of final-state hadrons in the event; the \u03c0 0 -hadron correlations probe an extra nonperturbative function, assuming factorization, and thus one more Gaussian j T convolution than the direct photonhadron correlations.",

The measured p out distributions presented here are at a higher center of mass energy and have significantly reduced statistical uncertainties compared to [50]. The higher center of mass energy also allows the probing of smaller x values of the TMD PDFs.

Additionally, due to the limited acceptance of the PHENIX detector, the per-trigger yields are divided by a mixed event distribution. Mixed event distributions are collected on a run-by-run basis to quantify any changing inefficiencies with time in the acceptance.

To reduce the contribution from decay photons, candidate inclusive photons are tagged and removed if a partner photon of p T > 1 GeV is found such that the invariant mass of the pair falls within the regions of 118-162 or 500-600 MeV/c 2 . The tagging cuts use a larger \u03c0 0 invariant mass range than for identifying \u03c0 0 for dihadron correlations to err on the side of removing more decay photons. An isolation cut further suppresses decay photons as well as NLO fragmentation photons by requiring that the sum of the EMCal energy deposits and p T of charged tracks within a radius of 0.4 radians around the candidate photon be less than 10% of the photon's total energy. To reduce the impact of detector acceptance effects, photons that pass the isolation and tagging cuts are also required to be \u223c0.1 radians from the edge of the detector in both \u03b7 and \u03c6 forcing a large portion of the isolation cone to fall inside the PHENIX acceptance.",

R \u03b3 was found by dividing the number of inclusive photons N inclusive by the number of decay photons N decay ; N decay was determined by counting the number of photons tagged from \u03c0 0 decays and correcting for higher mass states and the PHENIX single and diphoton detection efficiencies derived from a geant-based simulation. tag decay can then be calculated with R \u03b3 and the number of tagged decay photons N tag dec and inclusive photons N inclusive . As a cross check, systematic uncertainties on R \u03b3 were evaluated using the direct photon and \u03c0 0 pQCD cross sections with the CT10 PDFs [59] and DSS14 FFs [60]. The tagging efficiency is 0.36-0.43 and the isolation efficiency is 0.61-0.69 from the lowest to highest p trig T bins. Note that each quantity in Eq. 7 is dependent only on p trig T . Figure 3 shows the values of R iso \u03b3 as a function of p \u03b3 T ; for which values greater than unity indicate isolated direct-photon production. The azimuthal correlations as a function of \u2206\u03c6 show standard jet structure characteristics. The \u03c0 0 yields have clear peaks at both \u2206\u03c6 = 0 and \u2206\u03c6 = \u03c0, indicating nearly back-to-back jet production. The near-side yields of the isolated direct photons are not plotted, similarly to Ref. [61], because the yields within the isolation cone are physically uninterpretable. In addition, the effect of k T smearing is characterized with the away-side peaks. The near-side \u03c0 0 peaks are larger than the away sides due to the effect of so called \"trigger bias,\" discussed in Ref. [45]. The away-side yields of the direct photons are smaller than those from the \u03c0 0 triggers due to the smaller jet energy sampled by direct photons; the \u03c0 0 has some fractional energy z \u03c0 0 E jet where z \u03c0 0 refers to the momentum fraction of the \u03c0 0 from the scattered parton and E jet is the energy of the jet, whereas the direct photon approximates the away-side jet energy at LO. The underlying event levels for \u03c0 0 and direct photon triggers are similar, which would be expected if the underlying event structure is completely uncorrelated from the partonic hard scattering. A 9% normalization uncertainty on the charged hadron yields is not shown on this figure or any of the following per-trigger yields. This uncertainty is of similar magnitude to [50] and is largely due to the uncertainty when matching tracks from the DC to the PC. All of the per-trigger yields as a function of \u2206\u03c6 can be found in the Supplemental Material [62].",

The direct photon p 2 out quantities are larger due to the smaller jet energy being sampled compared to the \u03c0 0 jet energies. The strong dependence of p 2 out on p assoc T is anticipated as could be ascertained from the definition of p out = p assoc T sin \u2206\u03c6. In the same \u2206\u03c6 region, as p assoc T gets larger, p out will also get larger. Figure 7 shows a subset of the p 2 out results for both direct photon and \u03c0 0 triggers as a function of p trig T in the p assoc T range 2-4 GeV/c. The \u03c0 0 -triggered p 2 out decreases with p trig T , although this dependence is small. The direct photons clearly have a strong dependence on p trig T relative to the \u03c0 0 triggers. The \u03c0 0 data shown in Fig. 7 contain a dependence on the fragmentation function not present in the direct photon data because the direct photons emerge directly from the hard scattering. To explore this dependence, pythia 6.4 [65] hard-scattered QCD events were analyzed to determine the average z T = p trig T /p trig T of a \u03c0 0 where the hat quantity refers to the hard scattered parton. z \u03c0 0 T was determined in the same bins used in the data to correct the \u03c0 0 p trig T to an estimated jet p T in order to make a better comparison between the direct photons and \u03c0 0 . T . After the correction, the \u03c0 0 and direct photon p 2 out do not appear to form a single continuous function; rather the \u03c0 0 p 2 out continue approximately linearly to lower p jet T . It is possible that the the stronger dependence of p 2 out on p trig T for the direct photons is due to the smaller jet energy being probed. This effect may also be seen for the low p trig T dihadron correlations in Table II   D. pout Distributions Figure 9 shows the per-trigger yields of the p out distributions for \u03c0 0 and direct photon triggers. Only away-side hadrons were used in making the distributions, with the requirement that the correlated hadron satisfy 2\u03c0/3 < \u2206\u03c6 < 4\u03c0/3. The underlying event was statistically subtracted out from the p out per-trigger yields using the parameters from the fits to the \u2206\u03c6 correlations with Eq. 11 in order to identify only charged hadron yield associated with the hard scattering. The underlying event yield for a given bin was statistically subtracted by applying a factor N UE = 1 \u2212 f (\u2206\u03c6) where f (\u2206\u03c6) is the correction function determined by C 0 divided by the fits to the \u2206\u03c6 correlations. For the smaller p trig T bins, this is an important subtraction because in the signal region \u2206\u03c6 \u223c \u03c0 the underlying event contributes roughly 50% of the away-side yield, as could be ascertained from Fig 4. The yield corrected by the underlying event factor N UE is then subjected to the usual construction of the correlation function outlined in Sec. III. Systematic uncertainties on the underlying event background subtraction were evaluated by performing the subtraction after changing the underlying event parameter C 0 to C 0 \u00b1 1\u03c3, where \u03c3 is the error on C 0 from the fit. These uncertainties were found to be on the order of tenths of a percent in the p out \u2248 0 region. The values of the p out distributions can be found in Tables III-XIII of the Supplemental Material [62]. Note that a 4% systematic uncertainty is assigned to p out due to the detector resolution on p assoc  Fig. 9 the solid lines are fits to the \u03c0 0 distributions and the dashed lines are fits to the isolated direct photon distributions. The Gaussian functions clearly fail past \u223c1.3 GeV, showing a transition to power law behavior which the Kaplan functions accurately describe. The power law behavior is generated from hard gluon radiation in the initial state or final state, whereas the Gaussian behavior is generated from the soft k T and j T and is demonstrated in the nearly back-to-back hadrons that are produced around p out \u2248 0.",

            "text": "The evolution of p out as a function of p trig T was characterized by the Gaussian widths at small p out . Figure 10 shows the widths from Gaussian fits to both \u03c0 0 and direct photon triggers as a function of p trig T . Systematic uncertainties were evaluated by altering the Gaussian fit region by \u00b1 0.15 GeV/c and taking the absolute value of the difference of the resulting widths. As the systematic uncertainties dominate the uncertainties of the widths, the error bars shown in Fig. 10 are the statistical and systematic uncertainties combined in quadrature. Similarly to p 2 out , the direct photons and \u03c0 0 both show decreasing widths with p trig T . Linear fits to the two sets of widths give slopes of \u22120.0055 \u00b1 0.0018(stat) \u00b1 0.0010(syst) for \u03c0 0 mesons and \u22120.0109 \u00b1 0.0039(stat) \u00b1 0.0016(syst) for direct photons. Systematic uncertainties on the slopes were conservatively estimated by evaluating the fit when the points were placed at the limits given by the systematic uncertainties, and then taking the difference of the slopes. Similarly to p 2 out the \u03c0 0 triggers were corrected by the same z \u03c0 0 T corrections from pythia. The result is shown in Fig. 11; again the z \u03c0 0 T correction amounts to a scale factor of approximately two for the p trig T of the \u03c0 0 triggers. When plotted against p trig T / z \u03c0 0 T the magnitude of the slope for the \u03c0 0 triggers is \u22120.0035 \u00b1 0.0012(stat) \u00b1 0.0006(syst). It should be noted that the slope of the widths changes if the minimum p assoc T cut is increased, but that the slope always remains negative. Integrating over the full range of 0.7 < p assoc T < 10 GeV/c allowed by the PHENIX detector gives the smallest magnitude slope, thus it is the most conservative measurement for comparing to CSS evolution. For example, the slope of the Gaussian widths of p out for 1.2 < p assoc T < 10 GeV/c was determined to be \u22120.012 \u00b1 0.003(stat) \u00b1 0.001(syst) for \u03c0 0 -meson and \u22120.023 \u00b1 0.007(stat) \u00b1 0.003(syst) for direct-photon triggers. The same behavior can be seen in the values of p 2 out in Fig. 7 and in the Supplemental Material [62].",

Interpretation of p 2 out is slightly different than that of the Gaussian widths from the p out distributions, because the Gaussian widths are extracted from fits to the nearly back-to-back region, which is generated only by nonperturbative k T and j T . The p 2 out values are extracted from fits to the entire away-side jet region in the \u2206\u03c6 correlations; therefore, these quantities inherently include the charged hadrons in the perturbatively generated tail away from \u2206\u03c6 \u223c \u03c0 whereas the Gaussian  are dominated by the nearly back-to-back region as this is where most of the away-side charged hadrons are, but this subtle difference between the two observables should be noted. The widths quantified by p 2 out have the benefit that they can be extracted from the finely binned p trig T \u2297 p assoc T \u2206\u03c6 angular correlations. Throughout this discussion, we will use the term \"width\" to refer to both the p 2 out and Gaussian widths extracted from p out . There is a difference in the mix of scattered away-side partons probed by inclusive-\u03c0 0 and direct-photon triggers. Figure 12 shows the fractional contribution to the total cross section calculated in pQCD for the LO diagrams for (a) inclusive-\u03c0 0 and (b) direct-photon production. The CTEQ6L1 [66] PDFs were used for the calculations in addition to the DSS14 FFs [60] for the \u03c0 0 . At LO, quark-gluon Compton scattering accounts for approximately 85% of direct photons produced at midrapidity, while \u03c0 0 triggers are instead generated by a significant contribution of qg, gg, and qq scatterings. Therefore, any comparison between direct photon and \u03c0 0 triggers could be affected by the fact that the away-side charged hadrons are produced by quark jets \u223c85% of the time for direct photons and a mix of gluon and quark jets for the \u03c0 0 . For the direct photon partonic fractions, NLO corrections do not make a significant difference in the dominance of the quark-gluon Compton scattering process in the central rapidity region studied here [67].",

As was mentioned in the Introduction, the expectation from CSS evolution is that momentum widths sensitive to nonperturbative transverse momentum scales should increase with the hard scale. To compare to what is predicted by CSS evolution, the slopes were compared to a slope of zero as this quantifies the boundary between narrowing and increasing widths with p trig T . The confidence interval excludes a slope of zero at the 2.6\u03c3 level for both the \u03c0 0 and direct photon triggered correlations. The likelihood ratio from a slope of zero was calculated to be 0.03 for both the \u03c0 0 and direct photon triggered correlations, which implies that the data is not consistent with a flat line. Because k T and j T have been measured to be approximately constant in the p trig T region probed here [45,50], kinematically it would be expected that the acoplanarity decrease with p trig T . However, this same argument would apply for both DY and SIDIS, showing that the effect of decreasing widths seen in \u03c0 0 \u2212 h \u00b1 and direct \u03b3 \u2212 h \u00b1 correlations cannot be a kinematic or fragmentation effect alone. It is also interesting that Ref. [51] shows that in dijet correlations at very high p T and \u221a s, momentum widths sensitive to initial-state k T increase with the p T of the jet. These measurements are at large p T and sensitive to large k T at the higher \u221a s of the Large Hadron Collider, and thus follow the leading-log approximation which is also purely perturbative and predicts increasing widths with the hard scale (see e.g. [70] and references within).",

At this time, QCD was still in the early stages of development, and nonperturbative dynamics were not the focus within the framework of pQCD. As QCD became well established as the theory of the strong force, measurements performed at high enough energies for perturbative techniques to be applicable began to be used routinely to constrain nonperturbative physics in the form of collinear PDFs and FFs. It is only in the last two decades that there has been increasing focus on using perturbative techniques to understand nonperturbative parton dynamics. The study of such nonperturbative dynamics provides information on parton behavior within bound states and the process of hadronization by defining and constraining TMD PDFs and FFs. Importantly, it is additionally offering new insights on fundamental aspects of QCD as a nonAbelian gauge-invariant quantum field theory, for example through the predicted relative sign difference of the Sivers TMD PDF when probed via SIDIS versus DY [27], and through TMD factorization breaking in certain processes [28]. Factorization breaking results from basic QCD principles. Namely, nonAbelian phase interferences from the exchange of gluons between colored objects cannot, in general, be disentangled. Similarly, phase interferences from gluon exchange play a role in the Sivers effect where it implies a sign change for the Sivers function between DY and SIDIS interactions. The reason that gluon exchange in DY and SIDIS does not lead to factorization breaking is because DY and SIDIS are both quantum electrodynamic processes at LO, so there are limited paths for gluon exchange. Only initial-state exchange in DY and final-state exchange in SIDIS are possible, whereas in hadronic collisions with a final-state hadron measured both initial-and final-state exchanges are possible.",

Before the recent interest in understanding TMD evolution, measured deviations from calculations at some given scale assuming factorization holds were the only obvious way to look for factorization breaking effects. Such calculations are not available. Simply looking for qualitative differences in the evolution of the observable gives a clear discrepancy with the expectation from CSS evolution, and this is significantly more powerful than trying to compare with a calculation that requires greater knowledge of the nonperturbative functions. It is furthermore interesting to point out that the inclusive hadron transverse single-spin asymmetries in hadronic collisions measured at forward rapidities also deviate from the expectation provided by standard perturbative evolution. In charged pion production, the asymmetry changes strikingly little from \u221a s = 4.9 GeV to \u221a s = 62.4 GeV [71]. Asymmetries have been measured to be nonzero at center of mass energies up to 200 GeV and appear to plateau at p T up to 5 GeV/c [72], while perturbative techniques give a clear prediction that the asymmetry should fall off as p T increases [73].",

            "text": "Without any available theoretical calculations of our observable, the results found in the data as well as the expectation from CSS evolution were investigated with a pythia simulation. Factorization breaking is not predicted in DY production because there are no final-state hadrons produced directly from the hard scattering. The same observable p out can be constructed in DY events with two nearly back-to-back leptons. For dileptons, it would be expected that the Gaussian width of p out would broaden as one increases the hard scale of the interaction, as DY is known to follow CSS evolution. The Perugia0 tune [74] should be ideal to study this because it was tuned to the CDF Z 0 cross section data at low p T [75]. Therefore the Perugia tunes should be reasonably adequate at reproducing DY events where the total p T is small. pythia 6.4 DY events were generated and p out was determined for the correlated dileptons to confirm the expectation from CSS evolution for this observable. p out is defined similarly to Eq. 1, p out = p lep T sin \u2206\u03c6 where the higher-p T lepton is taken as the near-side trigger particle and the lower-p T lepton is taken as the away-side associated particle used in the determination of p out . The distributions were fit with Gaussian functions in the nonperturbative nearly back-to-back region, and the widths of the dilepton p out distributions are shown in Fig. 13. pythia reproduces the expectation that the widths of the DY pairs increase with the Q 2 of the interaction when p out is only sensitive to initial-state k T and there are no final-state hadrons. The widths are quantitatively much larger than the dihadron or direct photon-hadron widths because the DY dileptons emerge from the virtual photon, which means that, in the PHENIX pseudorapidity region, their p T is large. When measuring a final-state hadron, p out by definition must be smaller for the case of a measured final-state hadron vs. a DY lepton because the p T of the charged hadron must be smaller than or equal to the p T of the scattered parton due to the fragmentation process. Any quantitative value of p out will naturally be dependent on the p assoc T measured; see Fig. 6. In DY, each lepton will have approximately half the momentum of the interaction hard scale, and the larger the momentum the larger p out can be while still being in the nearly back-to-back region \u2206\u03c6 \u223c \u03c0, i.e. nonperturbatively generated. What is relevant is the evolution of this width with the hard scale of the interaction, not the quantitative value, as this is just indicative of what away-side p assoc T is observed. The DY widths were fit with a linear function shown as the blue dotted line in the region which was most linear, 5-10 GeV/c 2 , and the slope of the line was determined to be 0.146\u00b10.004. Additionally the red solid line shows a log fit over the full invariant mass range. The DY slope is the opposite sign from the direct photon-hadron and dihadron correlations and it is also approximately one order of magnitude larger making it significantly different from the dihadron and direct photon-hadron slopes.",

The negative sign of the slope was found in both the quark-gluon Compton and quarkantiquark annihilation processes for isolated direct photon production, indicating that the effect in pythia is not due to a difference in quark vs. gluon fragmentation. Additionally, as the minimum p assoc constructing the p out distributions, the slope of the Gaussian widths increases, similarly to what is seen in data. One noticeable difference between pythia and the data is the quantitative values of the widths. Here the results from pythia differ by about \u223c15% for both the \u03c0 0 and direct photon triggers, depending on the p trig T bin. The nonperturbative Gaussian behavior of p out is generated by the soft initial-state k T and final-state j T as indicated in Fig. 1. In the nearly back-to-back region p out < \u223c 1.3 GeV/c, p out is small and thus can only be generated by soft gluon radiation because the two particles are nearly coplanar. It is unsurprising that pythia does not replicate the quantitative values of the Gaussian widths well as there is little data that would offer constraints to this region. What is striking is that pythia replicates the evolution rate for both \u03c0 0 and direct photon Gaussian widths.",

After a parton interacts in pythia, the remnants of the two protons are free to interact with other objects in the event, and every object in the interaction is forced to color neutralize. Factorization breaking effects are predicted in dihadron and direct photon-hadron correlations due to the possibility of gluon exchange in both the initial and final states. This includes gluon exchange with remnants of the interaction, because the remnants of the interacting protons can exchange gluons with partons in both the initial and final states. Sensitivity to these effects requires a small transverse momentum scale; in the transverse-momentum-integrated case observables no longer have this sensitivity. For this reason it is plausible that pythia could be sensitive to these effects because of interactions between the proton remnants and partons involved in the hard scattering. Because pythia allows initial-and final-state interactions via gluon exchanges, the necessary interactions to allow for factorization breaking effects are present within the pythia framework.

            "text": "The underlying mechanism that leads to the prediction of the sign change in the Sivers function or factorization breaking is gluon exchange between partons associated with the hard scattering and colored remnants. In cases where factorization breaking is predicted, it implies that the traditional organization of the nonperturbative objects into separate PDFs and FFs for each colliding proton and produced hadron no longer holds. However, so far we have no knowledge of how to approach a reorganization of the nonperturbative objects, which would presumably include novel correlation functions describing partons correlated across the colliding protons. The fact that pythia accurately describes both the qualitative and quantitative nature of the slopes of the widths as a function of hard scale offers a potential path forward to greater understanding and further advancing what can be calculated within the rigors of pQCD.",

            "text": "Dihadron and direct photon-hadron correlations sensitive to nonperturbative transverse momentum effects have been measured in the PHENIX experiment at RHIC in \u221a s = 510 GeV p+p collisions, motivated by the prediction of factorization breaking in such processes [28][29][30][31]. Correlations between \u03c0 0 or direct photons with charged hadrons were measured. The azimuthal angular separation \u2206\u03c6 and out-of-plane transverse momentum component p out for the correlated pairs were measured. p out has sensitivity to nonperturbative transverse momentum in the initial state, as well as in the final state when a produced hadron is measured. The p 2 out and Gaussian widths of the p out distributions were measured from the correlations, and both observables decrease with the hard scale of the interaction p trig T . The direct photons exhibit a larger dependence than the \u03c0 0 triggers on p trig T for both p 2 out and the Gaussian widths of p out . The narrowing of the Gaussian widths as a function of p trig T indicates that the Collins-Soper-Sterman soft factor cannot be driving the evolution, in contrast with Drell-Yan dilepton production and SIDIS where factorization is predicted to hold and the widths are empirically known to increase with hard scale. Study of the same observables via the pythia event generator, which allows for gluon exchange between partons involved in the hard scattering and the proton remnants, reveals strikingly similar characteristics. The similarity between pythia and the experimental data offers a promising path forward to understand the mechanism in QCD driving the observed evolution in more detail.",

In addition, the effect of k T smearing is characterized with the away-side peaks.

The away-side yields of the direct photons are smaller than those from the \u03c0 0 triggers due to the smaller jet energy sampled by direct photons; the \u03c0 0 has some fractional energy z \u03c0 0 E jet where z \u03c0 0 refers to the momentum fraction of the \u03c0 0 from the scattered parton and E jet is the energy of the jet, whereas the direct photon approximates the away-side jet energy at LO.
