These modulations were recently measured by the HERMES experiment at DESY on proton and deuteron targets, and by the COMPASS experiment using the CERN SPS muon beam and a 6 LiD target. In both cases, the amplitudes of the cos \u03c6 h and cos 2\u03c6 h modulations show strong kinematic dependences for both positive and negative hadrons. It has been known since some time that the measured final-state hadrons in those SIDIS experiments receive a contribution from exclusive diffractive production of vector mesons, particularly important at large values of z, the fraction of the virtual photon energy carried by the hadron. In previous measurements of azimuthal asymmetries this contribution was not taken into account, because it was not known that it could distort the azimuthal modulations. Presently, a method to evaluate the contribution of the exclusive reactions to the azimuthal asymmetries measured by COMPASS has been developed. The subtraction of this contribution results in a better understanding of the kinematic effects, and the remaining non-zero cos 2\u03c6 h modulation gives indication for a non-zero Boer-Mulders effect.",

            "text": "where \u03c6 h is the azimuthal angle of the hadron with respect to the lepton scattering plane, in a reference system in which the z-axis is the virtual photon direction and the x-axis is defined by the scattered lepton transverse momentum. The transverse momentum p h T of the hadron is the component of p h orthogonal to the z-axis and z is the fraction of the available energy carried by the hadron. The quantity x is the Bjorken variable, y is the fractional energy of the virtual photon, \u03c3 0 is the \u03c6 h -independent part of the cross section, \u03bb is the longitudinal polarisation of the incident lepton, and 1 , 2 and 3 are kinematic factors depending on y. The amplitudes A XU f (\u03c6 h ) are referred to as azimuthal asymmetries in the following. The superscripts UU and LU refer to unpolarised beam and target, and to longitudinally polarised beam and unpolarised target, respectively. The possible explanation of the origin of unpolarised azimuthal asymmetries in SIDIS was given by Cahn using the simple parton model based on unpolarised TMD PDFs and FFs [4]. In this model the A UU cos \u03c6 h and A UU cos 2\u03c6 h asymmetries arise at O(1/Q) and O(1/Q 2 ), respectively, as kinematic corrections to the leading order cross-section. This approach was used, for example, in Ref. [5] to extract the value of intrinsic transverse momentum of quarks in a nucleon from existing experimental data. Within the modern pQCD approach [2], the azimuthal asymmetries in the unpolarised part of the SIDIS cross section are the O(1) (leading order) A UU cos 2\u03c6 h , given by a convolution of the twist-2 Boer-Mulders PDFs and the Collins FFs, and the O(1/Q) A UU cos \u03c6 h asymmetry which is given by the sum of four different convolutions containing twist-3 PDFs or FFs. Notice that neglecting the quark-gluon-quark correlations in the TMD PDFs and FFs and the contributions from the T-odd distribution functions in the expression for A UU cos \u03c6 h in Ref. [2] only one contribution survives reproducing the result of the simple TMD parton model. Measurements of the \"unpolarised\" SIDIS azimuthal asymmetries were recently performed by the HERMES Collaboration for charged hadrons, pions and kaons using both proton and deuteron targets [6], and by the COMPASS Collaboration for charged hadrons using a deuteron ( 6 LiD) target [3]. They all show strong dependences on the kinematic variables. Several phenomenological analyses (for more details see Ref. [7]) did not succeed either in reproducing the data or in extracting the Boer-Mulders PDF. As a result the present knowledge of the quark intrinsic transverse momentum has very large uncertainties and a possible non-zero Boer-Mulders function in the SIDIS cross section has still to be demonstrated.",

Assuming that this asymmetry is mainly due to the kinematic Cahn effect, it should be negative, with absolute value increasing almost linearly with z and p h T and proportional to k 2 T . The trend of the data is, however, quite different. The measured z dependence of the integrated asymmetry 2 shows a strong increase of absolute value starting at z 0.5. Moreover, looking at the three-dimensional result, 3 at high z the p h T dependence is the opposite of the expected one, and the x dependence changes behaviour from low to high z.",

            "text": "These observations suggest that another mechanism, different from the TMD parton model, is at work in hadron production at large z. As a matter of fact it is known that the charged hadron SIDIS sample at large z and at small p h T contains a non-negligible contribution of hadrons from the decay of vector mesons (VM) produced in exclusive diffractive processes. This contribution was indeed taken into account in the measurements of hadron multiplicities [8][9][10][11][12]. Now, for the first time, we have investigated the effect of this VM contribution on the azimuthal asymmetries. We have measured azimuthal asymmetries for h + and h \u2212 originating from the decay of exclusively produced VMs (referred to as exclusive-VM hadrons in the following), and found them to be large. Since they do not have an interpretation in the framework of the parton model TMD formalism, we have subtracted this contribution from the COMPASS asymmetries published in Ref. [3], referred to as \"unsubtracted\" asymmetries in the following. This correction considerably improves the agreement with the expectations for A UU cos \u03c6 h and has also a noticeable effect for A UU cos 2\u03c6 h . The paper is organized as follows: in Section 2 the measurement of the azimuthal modulations for exclusive-VM hadrons is described. In Section 3 we present the calculation of the fraction of exclusive-VM hadrons in the measured hadron sample. In Section 4 we describe the procedure used to subtract the exclusive-VM hadron contribution to the azimuthal asymmetries previously published by COMPASS [3], and give the final results.",

The |\u03c6 h | distribution of the exclusive-VM hadrons shows large modulations, as can be seen in the left panel of Fig. 2 for positive hadrons.

The sin \u03c6 h modulation is not included because parallel studies on exclusive vector-meson production in COMPASS do not exhibit such a modulation [13]. Other possible orthogonal modulations are not relevant since they do not appear in the SIDIS cross section. The fitted amplitudes of the cos \u03c6 h and cos 2\u03c6 h modulations for exclusive-VM hadrons, a UU,excl cos \u03c6 h and a UU,excl cos 2\u03c6 h , decrease with increasing p h T and are almost equal for h + and h \u2212 , indicating that what is modulated is the direction of the parent VM. As an example, the amplitudes a UU,excl cos \u03c6 h for 0.1 GeV/c < p h T < 0.3 GeV/c are shown in the first column of Fig. 3 for both h + and h \u2212 . The a UU,excl cos \u03c6 h amplitude is very large in absolute value at large and small z, and changes sign at z 0.5. The a UU,excl cos 2\u03c6 h amplitudes are smaller but still non-negligible. It should be noted that the results of the present analysis refer to a 6 LiD target and COM-PASS kinematics. The observed azimuthal asymmetries for exclusive-VM hadrons depend on the angular distributions for \u03c1 0 decay and production, which are determined by Spin Density Matrix Elements (SDMEs). The SDMEs depend on \u03c1 0 transverse momentum [14] and on the mechanism of its production. In particular, for coherent production on the target nuclei, which dominates at small p h T , one may expect different angular distributions (different SDMEs) than those for the production on a single free or quasi-free nucleon.",

Here we use a parameterisation obtained from previous works [9][10][11], which was based on a combined use of HEPGEN [15] and LEPTO [16] Monte Carlo generators. The former one is used to model differential cross sections of various hard processes of exclusive leptoproduction of single mesons or photons at COMPASS kinematics. For the determination of r, only exclusive \u03c1 0 production, which gives the main contribution to the exclusive-VM hadrons, is taken into account in the present study.

One can also see that the contribution of exclusive-VM hadrons is sizable at all z.",

The inner error bars correspond to the statistical uncertainties only, while the outer bars represent the total uncertainties. The increase in the statistical uncertainties is due to the low statistics of the exclusive-VM hadrons. The systematic uncertainties have been evaluated by adding in quadrature the uncertainties of the unsubtracted asymmetries (estimated to be of the same order of the statistical ones) and those due to the subtraction procedure. For the last ones the dominant contribution is that of the poor knowledge of r, which can cause an uncertainty at most as large as the statistical one, apart from a few bins at the highest zand lowest x-values. The total uncertainties are evaluated by adding in quadrature the statistical and the systematic uncertainties. The numerical values of the asymmetries are available on HepData [17].",

            "text": "In spite of the large uncertainties we consider this work as a major step forward in understanding the 3D structure of the nucleon. To give an idea of the impact, in Fig. 9 we compare A UU cos \u03c6 h with a simple Monte Carlo simulation for the Cahn effect. We have used the Monte Carlo code of Refs. [18,19], describing the fragmentation of polarised quarks, which was modified to include the Cahn effect. This is achieved by generating the azimuthal modulations of the transverse momentum of the fragmenting quark according to the lepton-quark hard cross section calculated in the simple TMD parton model for a non-zero k T [4]. The p h 2 T dependence on z is built in and a suitable dependence of k 2 T on x has been used to reproduce the values of A UU cos \u03c6 h at z 0.5. The agreement is satisfactory and the trends are similar over all bins, except for the two bins at p h T > 0.5 GeV/c and z > 0.7. The same Monte Carlo simulation is also used to investigate the twist-4 azimuthal modulations generated by the O(1/Q 2 ) Cahn effect, thus neglecting the contributions from target and produced hadron mass corrections. The resulting amplitudes A UU cos 2\u03c6 h turn out to be compatible with zero. Other contributions, which are not generated by Boer-Mulders and Collins effect, appear also at twist-4 or higher orders. Although these contributions are not very well known, they should be suppressed as 1/Q 2 , thus it is most likely that the non-zero A UU cos 2\u03c6 h values of Fig. 7 and 8 are an indication of a non-zero Boer-Mulders PDF. Specifically, the corrected data for A UU cos 2\u03c6 h for positive hadrons still show a strong z dependence in the highest p h T -bin, with a    significance above 5 \u03c3 . The phenomenological study of this effect is, however, beyond the scope of the present paper.",

The amplitudes of the modulations are found to be large and of the same sign for positive and negative hadrons. These hadrons constitute a contamination to the SIDIS hadron sample. Their contribution to the previously published COMPASS A UU, uns cos \u03c6 h and A UU, uns cos 2\u03c6 h unpolarised azimuthal asymmetries is estimated quantitatively and shown to be non-negligible over all the explored kinematic region and in particular at large z. After subtracting their cos \u03c6 h amplitudes, the A UU cos \u03c6 h asymmetries turn out to be in reasonable agreement over most of the explored kinematic region with a Monte Carlo simulation implementing the Cahn effect, except for a very few bins at large z and large p h T . The experimental determination of this important correction to already published data, which so far was never evaluated, is expected to have significant impact onto phenomenological analyses. When implemented, it could hopefully allow for a successful disentangling of the various contributions to the data and for a first extraction of the Boer-Mulders function.",
