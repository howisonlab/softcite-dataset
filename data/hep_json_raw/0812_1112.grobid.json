The errors on the KLOE BR values are dominated by the uncertainty on the K L lifetime \u03c4 L ; since the dependence of the geometrical efficiency on \u03c4 L is known, KLOE can solve for \u03c4 L by imposing x BR(K L \u2192 x) = 1 (using previous averages for the minor BRs), thereby greatly reducing the uncertainties on the BR values obtained. Our fit makes use of the KLOE BR values before application of this constraint: BR(K e3 ) = 0.4049 (21), BR(K \u00b53 ) = 0.2726 (16), BR(K e3 ) = 0.2018 (24), and BR(K e3 ) = 0.1276 (15). The dependence of these values on \u03c4 L and the correlations between the errors are taken into account. KLOE has also measured \u03c4 L directly, by fitting the proper decay time distribution for K L \u2192 3\u03c0 0 events, for which the reconstruction efficiency is high and uniform over a fiducial volume of \u223c0.4\u03bb L .

The best way to include this measurement in our analysis would be via a combined fit to K S and K L branching ratio and lifetime measurements. Indeed, such a fit would be useful in properly accounting for correlations between K S and K L modes introduced with the preliminary NA48 measurement of \u0393(K L \u2192 3\u03c0 0 ), and more importantly, via the PDG ETAFIT result, which we use in the fit to K L branching ratios.

Three new preliminary measurements were reported by NA48/2 and KLOE (see Tab. 4): A preliminary result of NA48/2, based on about 4000 K e2 events from the 2003 data set, was presented in 2005 [44]. Another preliminary result, based on also about 4000 events, recorded in a minimum bias run period in 2004, was shown at KAON07 [45]. Both results have independent statistics and are also independent in the systematic uncertainties, as the systematics are either of statistical nature (as e.g. trigger efficiencies) or determined in an independent way. Another preliminary result, based on about 8000 K e2 events, was presented at KAON07 by the KLOE collaboration [46]. Both, the KLOE and the NA48/2 measurements are inclusive with respect to final state radiation contribution due to bremsstrahlung. The small contribution of K l2\u03b3 events from direct photon emission from the decay vertex was subtracted by each of the experiments. Combining these new results with the current PDG value yields a current world average of",

The conclusions of this study are a) that neglecting a quadratic term in the parameterization of the scalar form factor when fitting results leads to a shift of the value of the linear term by about 3.5 times the value of the quadratic term; and b) that because of correlations, it is impossible to measure the quadratic slope parameter from quadratic fits to the data at any plausible level of statistics. The use of the linear representation of the scalar form factor is thus inherently unsatisfactory. Figure 3 shows the 1-\u03c3 contours from all the experimental results (K e3 and K \u00b53 ). It is immediately clear from the figure that the new NA48 results are difficult to accommodate 1 . Performing the combination with and without the NA48 results for the K \u00b53 form-factor slopes included we obtain fit probability values of 1 \u00d7 10 \u22126 and 22.3% respectively(see Appendix D for a detailed comparison).

[18], and f 4 | loc (\u00b5) is the O(p 6 ) local contribution, whose knowledge cannot be simply deduced from other processes. Several analytical approaches to determine f 4 have been attempted over the years [60], essentially confirming the original estimate by Leutwyler and Roos [57] (see Fig. 5). The benefit of these new results, obtained using more sophisticated techniques, lies in the fact that a better control over the systematic uncertainties of the calculation has been obtained. However, the size of the error is still around or above 1%, which is not comparable to the 0.2% accuracy which has been reached for |V us | \u00d7 f + (0). Recent progress in lattice QCD gives us more optimism in the reduction of the error on f + (0) below the 1% level [62,61,63]. Most of the currently available lattice QCD results have been obtained with relatively heavy pions and the chiral extrapolation represents the dominant source of uncertainty. As shown in Figure 5, there is a general trend of lattice QCD results to be slightly lower than analytical approaches. An important step in the 1 . 1 1 1 . 1 4 1 . 7 1 . 2 0 1 . 2 3 1  reduction of the error associated to the chiral extrapolation has been recently made by the UKQCD-RBC collaboration [58]. Their preliminary result f + (0) = 0.964(5) is obtained from the unquenched study with N F = 2 + 1 flavors, with an action that has good chiral properties on the lattice even at finite lattice spacing (domain-wall quarks). They also reached pions masses ( 330 MeV) much lighter than that used in previous studies of f + (0). The overall error is estimated to be 0.5%, which is very encouraging. Moreover, they observe for f + (0) a mass dependence similar to the one of f 2 . That is something new with respect to previous lattice studies (this is likely due to the fact that they work with lighter pions). To assess the chiral uncertainty of f 4 , polynomial fits (linear and quadratic) well reproduce the data. However, it would be interesting [61] to have the expression of \u2206(\u00b5) in Eq. (4.4) in terms of the quark masses so to directly estimate f 4 | loc (\u00b5). Moreover, it should also be stressed that the present study is performed at a single value of the lattice spacing (a = 0.12 fm) and in a relatively small extension of the fifth dimension of the lattice. 3 In the following phenomenological analysis we will use this result as the present best estimate of f + (0), although some reservation remains.",

As a result, in the determination of f K /f \u03c0 lattice QCD [64]- [67] has essentially no competition from purely analytical approaches. The status of the lattice results for f K /f \u03c0 is summarized in Fig. 6. As can be seen, the present overall accuracy is about 1%. The novelty are the new lattice results with N F = 2 + 1 dynamical quarks and pions as light as 280 MeV [64,65], obtained by using the so-called staggered quarks. 4 The analyzes of [64,65], cover a broad range of lattice spacings (i.e. a=0.06 and 0.15 fm) and is performed on sufficiently large physical volumes (m \u03c0 L 5.0). It should be stressed, however, that the sensitivity of f K /f \u03c0 to lighter pions is larger than in the computation of f + (0) and that chiral extrapolations are far more demanding in this case. 5 Notice also that at Lattice 2007 preliminary studies with N F = 2 + 1 clover quarks and pion masses 200 MeV have been presented from either PACS-CS Collaboration [70] and ref. [71]. With respect to the results obtained with staggered quarks, the PACS-CS value of f K /f \u03c0 in fig. 6 is restricted to a single lattice spacing (a = 0.09 fm) and relatively small physical volume (m \u03c0 L 2.9). For ref. [71], the final analysis is to be completed. In the following analysis we will use as reference value the MILC-HPQCD result f K /f \u03c0 = 1.189(7) [65], although some reservation about staggered fermions remains.",

The dispersive parametrization for the scalar form factor proposed in [12] and discussed in 4 Staggered fermions come in four tastes on the lattice. In the continuum limit the extra degrees of freedom decouple from physical predictions. But, at finite lattice spacing, where the data are produced, the taste symmetry is violated and the extra degrees of freedom are removed by hand, namely by taking the fourth root of the staggered quark determinant. Theoretically, this procedure has been only confirmed in perturbation theory and is currently a subject of controversies within the lattice QCD community [68]. Since the staggered dynamical quarks are computationally cheap, they have been largely used. Thanks to recent progress in algorithm building [69], safer but still computationally competitive alternatives are becoming available. 5 In some details, effects of chiral logs are not clearly disentangled and analytic terms (NNLO or NNNLO)",

[64] and of ref. [65] with staggered quarks share the same configurations, but they differ in how to extrapolate to the physical masses. Then, the central values of fK /f\u03c0 between the two analyzes (namely, fK /f\u03c0 = 1.197 7 13 and fK /f\u03c0 = 1.189(7) from ref. [64] and ref. [65] respectively) differ for 1\u03c3. However, taking into account the complete uncertainty of fK /f\u03c0 in [64], we have fK /f\u03c0 = 1.194(10) of [64] for a symmetric error and the values of ref. [64] and ref. [65] look now in good agreement. The highly improved staggered fermions (HISQ) used in [65] for the valence quarks are designed to reduce the taste violation effects, which also should reduce the overall systematic uncertainty. Very recently KLOE [52] and NA48 [54] have presented results on the scalar FF slope using the dispersive parametrization. In these analyzes a dispersive parametrization is used for both the scalar and the vector form factors. A similar analysis has started for the KTeV data. We report these preliminary results for the first time. The ISTRA+ measurement of the scalar form factor slope performed using the first order Taylor expansion parametrization can be translated in the dispersive parametrization as described in Appendix E. The results are given in Table 9 for all the four experiments in the case of the pole parametrization for the vector form factor. The original KLOE and NA48 results are also shown for comparison as well as the preliminary result of KTeV obtained from the K \u00b53 data analysis. Moreover, a combined K e3 and K \u00b53 data analysis is also in progress and the preliminary result is: log(C) = 0.191 \u00b1 0.012. The preliminary KTeV results are obtained using the original MC and data from Ref. [48]. .   Figure 7 shows the values for f + (0) determined from the scalar form factor slope mea-surements obtained using the Callan-Treiman relation and f K /f \u03c0 = 1.189 (7). The value of f + (0) = 0.964 (5) from UKQCD/RBC is also shown. As already noticed in Section 3, the NA48 result is difficult to accommodate. Here one can see that this results is also not consistent with the theoretical estimates of f + (0). In particular, it violates the Fubini-Furlan bound f + (0) < 1 [72]. For this reason, the NA48 result will be excluded when using the Callan-Treiman constraint. The average of the experimental results on the FFs with the pole parametrization for the vector case and the dispersive parametrization for the scalar FF give: 6) with correlation coefficient \u22120.32. The above results are then combined with the lattice determinations of f K /f \u03c0 = 1.189 (7) and f + (0) = 0.964(5) using the constraint given by the Callan-Treiman relation. The results of the combination are given in Table 10, where log C = \u03bb c 0 t CT /m 2 \u03c0 + 0.0398 \u00b1 0.0041. (6) correlation matrix 1.",

As seen from Table 14, the measurement with the largest positive pull on the fit is the KLOE measurement of BR(3\u03c0 0 ), which PDG has chosen to eliminate from the 2006 fit as part of their treatment of the correlated KLOE measurements. We emphasize that the values of BR(K e3 ) and BR(K \u00b53 ) are not affected very much by these developments.
