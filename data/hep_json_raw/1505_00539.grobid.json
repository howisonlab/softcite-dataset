Y (4260) is a vector (J P C = 1 \u2212\u2212 ) state that is only barely observable as an schannel resonance in e + e \u2212 collisions and which appears at an energy where no conventional charmonium state is expected. Since its discovery, many theoretical studies have been carried out considering the Y (4260) as a tetraquark state [3], D 1 D or D 0 D * hadronic molecule [4], hybrid charmonium [5], baryonium state [6], etc.",

The systematic uncertainties of the luminosity, track reconstruction, and photon detection are 1.0% [11], 1.0% per track [30], and 1.0% per photon [31], respectively. The systematic uncertainty from branching fraction of \u03c0 0 and \u03b7 decays are taken from the PDG [23]. These sources of systematic uncertainty, which are summarized in the top part of Table II, are common for e + e \u2212 and \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 modes. The following sources of systematic uncertainty, which are uncorrelated for the e + e \u2212 and \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 modes, are summarized in the bottom part of Table II. The systematic uncertainty from branching fraction of J/\u03c8 decay is taken from the PDG [23]. The systematic uncertainty from the requirement on the number of MUC hits is 3.6% and estimated by comparing the efficiency of the MUC requirement between data and MC in the control sample e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 J/\u03c8 at \u221a s = 4.257 GeV. The systematic uncertainty from requirement of the J/\u03c8 signal region is estimated by smearing the invariant mass of l + l \u2212 of signal MC with a Gaussian function to compensate for the resolution difference between data and MC when calculating the efficiency. The parameters for smearing are determined by fitting J/\u03c8 distribution of data with the MC shape convoluted with a Gaussian function for the control sample e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 J/\u03c8. The difference in the detection efficiency between signal MC samples with and without the smearing is taken as the systematic uncertainty. The systematic uncertainty from the MC model is estimated by generating a MC sample with the angular distribution of leptons determined from \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8 data. The systematic uncertainty due to kinematic fitting is estimated by correcting the helix parameters of charged tracks according the method described in Ref. [32], where the correction factors are obtained from the control sample \u03c8 \u2032 \u2192 \u03b3\u03c7 cJ and the difference in the detection efficiency between with and without making the correction to the MC is taken as the systematic uncertainty. The uncorrelated systematic uncertainties for the electron and muon channels are combined by taking the weighted average with weights \u01eb ee B ee and \u01eb \u00b5\u00b5 B \u00b5\u00b5 , respectively. The total systematic uncertainty is obtained by summing all the sources of systematic uncertainty in quadrature.",
