The agreement spanned seven orders of magnitude in the cross section. However, at the LHC energies, deviations of factor two between the NLO and data have been reported by the ALICE collaboration [2] and CMS [3] (see Fig 1). It is already known that selecting a different fragmentation function [4] for the NLO calculation can bring down the deviation with data to 25 % [5,6]. However, it is not yet fully understood to what extent the so called higher twist (HT) processes, additional to NLO, contribute to the cross section. The HT processes have attracted attention also in the field of heavy ion collisions, in the so-called \"Baryon anomaly\", found in measurements of high-p T baryon production in heavy ion collisions [7]. So far the question of HT in the LHC is not settled [8].",

However, the experimentally measured n is not a constant n = 4, but depends on the studied process, collision energy and the range of x T , reaching values up to n \u223c 8 [9]. For example, the intrinsic partonic transverse momentum k T , QCD radiation, running coupling \u03b1 s , scaling violations in parton distribution functions (PDF) and fragmentation functions (FF) and smearing from the jet fragmentation transverse momentum j T lead into the experimentally observed n > 4 [9,10].

            "text": "The term \"twist\" is a historical relic originating from the operator product expansion, which was a tool used to obtain perturbative predictions for deep-inelastic scattering [11]. Today the leading twist (LT) is understood as standard processes of the pQCD within the collinear factorization, where hadrons are produced via fragmentation processes. In contrast, HT processes are often understood as direct hadron production, where the hadron is produced directly in the hard subprocess without fragmentation [9]. Due to the lack of fragmentation in HT, a production of a direct hadron is argued to involve a large number of active fields, which, according to dimensional counting rules presented in [7], lead to steeper p T spectra and larger scaling exponents n than for the LT hadrons. Therefore the scaling exponents are compared with those obtained from the NLO pQCD [5], as was done in [9]. The first calculations to estimate the size of the higher-twist contributions were carried out by Bagger and Gunion [12]. They found that the pion form factor in the \u03b3q \u2192 \u03c0q process resulted in an extra factor of 1/\u015d where\u015d is the partonic center-of-mass energy, causing an n = 6 scaling form for the cross section in Eq. (1). The HT contribution has been estimated to be significant especially in the kinematical range of high x T and low p T , i.e. at low \u221a s [11,13]. Previously, there have been various attempts to experimentally measure the magnitude of the HT effects. Collaborations such as WA77, WA69 and the OMEGA were presenting their findings of direct meson production in a Workshop on High p T Physics and Higher Twists in 1988. At that time there were many promising results interpreted as evidence of HT, in processes such as \u03bdN \u2192 \u00b5 + \u03c0 \u2212 X, Drell-Yann, \u03c1 production and in e + e \u2212 data [14].",

Based on MC studies of \u03b3q collisions carried out by the WA69 experiment [17], it was found that the shape of the inclusive p T distribution was not changed significantly by the HT. Based on this remark it would be preferable to take advantage of the expected special kinematical properties of a HT process, by using cuts that enrich the fraction of HT particles in the data. Because the direct meson is created without fragmentation, one could argue that using an isolation cut would enrich the fraction of these mesons in the data, by suppressing the LT mesons originating from fragmentation processes. The effect of isolation was studied in the MC level by the OMEGA Photon Collaboration [14], where the meson was not allowed to have any track in its vicinity in a cone of a fixed size. The result was that this kind of isolation did not help significantly in the kinematical range where the HT processes were expected to be significant compared to LT. Still, by including a HT component on top of a QCD based model was in somewhat better agreement with the data than a fit without HT, leaving some room for HT contribution in the interpretation of the data.",

To declare a particle as isolated, the p T sum in the cone was required to be less than 10 % of the particle's p T . It has been suggested that isolation cut would enrich the fraction of HT in the data. As a result, the scaling exponents n obtained from the isolated x T spectra were anticipated to be larger than in the inclusive case [9].  In Fig. 3 one can observe that the effect of the HT process depicted by Eq. (5) to the exponent n in PYTHIA8 is quite negligible. In fact, there was on the average only one HT pion per 10000 charged hadrons in the simulation and applying the isolation cuts enriched the ratio only by a factor of 2. This suggests that the HT process described in [13] does not have a significant role in LHC energies.",

By repeatedly sampling a fragmentation variable z from the exponential \"fragmentation function\", one could create a collection of hadrons from the initial parton. The isolation condition for the leading hadron could then be checked by comparing the hadron p T to the p T sum of all the other hadrons in the toy MC event. It was observed that mostly the high z hadrons survive the isolation cut. Isolation probabilites obtained with this method are shown in Fig. 4 (a), and the increase of the scaling exponents, \u2206n = n isolated \u2212 n, is shown in Fig. 4 (b). Using the isolation fractions from Fig. 4 (a) with Eq. (2), the scaling exponent increased by 0.679 \u00b1 0.008, marked by the red line in Fig. 4 (b).

It was shown that PYTHIA8 describes the shape of the p T spectra quite well, but the normalization is off by \u223c 20 %. If this normalization were correct, the scaling exponents would be similar to data. As it was expected that the HT contribution would steepen the spectra and thus increase n, the similar shape of the data with PYTHIA8 may suggest that the HT contribution is not very large.",

Hence, the direct pion production as described by [13] gives a negligible contribution to the cross section and leads into barely visible effects in both inclusive and isolated scaling exponents.",

Secondly, the p T cross section is harder at 7 TeV than at 2.76 TeV, which lead into higher probability for a hadron to be isolated at 2.76 TeV collision energy. The difference in the isolation probabilities directly results in an increase of the scaling exponent. It seems that the observed effect could be largely explained by these kinematical biases. A more careful study would be needed to verify to what extent there is room for HT contributions in the data. Also, the isolation study is so far done only with PYTHIA8, while the analysis for the ALICE data is ongoing.",
