The search is based on 20.3 fb \u22121 of proton-proton collision data taken at the LHC at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV recorded by the ATLAS detector. Events with one or two leptons, and one, two or three jets are selected with the additional requirement that at least one jet contains a b-quark. Single-lepton events are also required to contain at least one large-radius jet from the hadronic decay of a high-p T W boson or a top quark. No significant excess over the expected background is observed and upper limits on the cross-section times branching ratio for different vector-like quark and excited-quark model masses are derived. For the excited-quark production and decay to W t with unit couplings, quarks with masses below 1500 GeV are excluded and coupling-dependent limits are set.",

            "text": "The number of quark generations known within the Standard Model (SM) is three and the existence of additional heavy quarks similar to those in the SM is strongly constrained by the discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) [1][2][3]. Additional quarks that have non-SM Higgs couplings, in particular vector-like quarks (VLQs), remain popular, especially in models which address the naturalness question [4,5]. New quarks can have right and left handed couplings to the W boson and are color triplets [6]. VLQs appear in several extensions of the SM, such as extra dimensions [7], supersymmetry [8], composite Higgs [9,10] and little Higgs [11] models, in which they cancel top-quark loop contributions to the Higgs mass [12]. Depending on the model, VLQs can be realized in different multiplets, such as in singlets, doublets and triplets [13].",

The B can decay into Zb, Hb and Wt with the branching ratios given by the VLQ couplings 1 for singlet B. The light quark in the final state gives rise to a forward jet. The cross-section for singlet B production with subsequent decay to Wt has been calculated in the TS-10 model [10,14], a four-dimensional version of a model with composite fermions in a 10 representation of SO (5). The cross-section is given in table 1 for two values of the coupling parameter \u03bb, for which the 2 \u00d7 2 mass mixing matrix of the b-quark and the B has been diagonalised. The largest value of \u03bb for which the B decay width is still smaller than the experimental mass resolution is \u03bb = 3. A top-quark mass of 172.5 GeV is assumed throughout.",

The strength of the coupling is assumed to be f g = 1 in this paper unless otherwise indicated. The b * in the VLQ case has f L = f R = 1, but it is also allowed to have purely left-handed (f L = 1, f R = 0) or purely right-handed (f L = 0, f R = 1) couplings to the top quark. The crosssections times branching ratios for the production of b * with decay to Wt for these three coupling scenarios are given in table 2. For purely left-handed couplings the cross-sections are the same as those for purely right-handed couplings. However, for VLQ-like couplings the cross-sections are not exactly the sum of the individual contributions since setting both couplings to 1 modifies the b * decay branching ratios. In the following, f L = f R = 1 is assumed unless stated otherwise. After the decay of B/b * into Wt, the top quark decays into a b-quark and another W boson. At least one of the W bosons is required to decay leptonically (to an electron or muon, and the corresponding neutrino). Events are separated into dilepton and singlelepton signatures. A hadronically decaying W boson or top quark is identified by clustering its decay products into a single jet since for high B/b * masses the W boson and top quark are boosted. The clustering requirement is the main change in the analysis strategy for the single-lepton channel compared to the search for single-b * production in the complete 7 TeV LHC dataset collected by ATLAS [26]. It increases the sensitivity to high B and b * masses, where the top quark and W boson have large transverse momentum.",

            "text": "In the analysis presented here, six different single-lepton and dilepton signal regions (SR) are defined, which were optimised to maximise the expected significance for the B/b * models considered. This analysis is also complementary to the search of dijet mass resonances in ATLAS with data at \u221a s = 8 TeV, which probes the qg final state [35]. The main processes contributing to the background after applying all selection cuts are from topquark pair (tt) production and single top-quark production in association with a W boson. Other background contributions are from W -or Z-boson production in association with jets. Smaller contributions arise from diboson production processes and processes where a jet is misidentified as a lepton. To estimate these SM backgrounds in a consistent and robust fashion, corresponding control regions (CR) are defined for each of the signal regions. They are chosen to be non-overlapping with the SR selections in order to provide independent data samples enriched in particular background sources. The shape of the discriminating variable, the invariant mass for the single-lepton channel and transverse mass for the dilepton channel, is used in a binned likelihood fit to test for the presence of a signal. The systematic uncertainties and the MC statistical uncertainties on the expected values are included in the fit as nuisance parameters. These additional degrees of freedom allow the modelling of the backgrounds to be improved based on data, increasing the sensitivity to the signal. Correlations of a given nuisance parameter across the various regions, between the various backgrounds, and possibly the signal, are also taken into account. A background-only fit is used to determine the compatibility of the observed event yield in each SR with the corresponding SM background expectation. The improved post-fit model resulting from this fit is used throughout this paper for the presentation of control distributions. The observed and expected upper limits at 95% CL on the number of events from VLQ phenomena for each signal region are derived using a Bayesian approach.",

A parton-jet matching scheme is employed to avoid double-counting of partonic configurations generated by both the matrix-element calculation and the parton shower [56]. The samples are generated separately for W/Z with light-quark jets (W +light-jets, Z+light-jets) and heavy-quark jets (W bb+jets, W cc+jets, W c+jets, Zbb+jets, Zcc+jets). Overlap between the events in samples with heavy quarks generated from the matrix-element calculation and those generated from parton-shower evolution in the samples with light-quark jets is avoided via an algorithm based on the angular separation between the extra heavy quarks, Q: if \u2206R(Q, Q ) > 0.4, the matrix-element prediction is used, otherwise the parton-shower prediction is used. Diboson events (W W , W Z, ZZ) are generated with Alpgen interfaced to Herwig v6.52 [57] for hadronisation and Jimmy v4.31 [58] for the modelling of the underlying event, with the CTEQ6L1 PDF set.",

A veto is placed on electrons in the transition region between the barrel and end-cap calorimeter, 1.37 < |\u03b7 cluster | < 1.52. The electron track is required to originate less than 2 mm along the z-axis (longitudinal impact parameter) from the selected event primary vertex. The three main sources of background for high-E T isolated electrons are hadrons misidentified as electrons, photon conversions and electrons originating from secondary vertices in decays of heavy-flavour hadrons (non-prompt electrons). In order to suppress the background from these sources, it is required that there is little calorimeter activity in the region surrounding the electron candidate. Two isolation variables are defined for this purpose: the energy deposited around the electron candidate in the calorimeter with a cone size of \u2206R = 0.2, and the sum of the transverse momenta of all tracks in a cone of size \u2206R = 0.3 around the electron candidate. Efficiencies and purities of the identification and isolation requirements are corrected with appropriate scale factors to match the simulation to the data.

Small-R jets from additional simultaneous pp interactions are rejected by an additional requirement: the ratio of the scalar sum of the p T of tracks associated with the jet and the primary vertex to the scalar sum of the p T of all tracks associated with the jet must be at least 0.5 for jets with p T < 50 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.4. Large-R jets (j 10 ) have a radius parameter of 1.0 [68] and are subject to a trimming procedure [69] to minimise the impact of energy depositions from pile-up interactions. The trimming algorithm reconstructs constituent jets with the k t algorithm [70][71][72] with a radius parameter of 0.3 from the clusters belonging to the original large-R jet. Constituent jets contributing less than 5% of the large-R jet p T are removed. The remaining energy depositions are used to calculate the kinematic and substructure properties of the large-R jet. The masses of the large-R jets (m j 10 ) are calibrated to their particle-level values [67,73,74]. In the analysis, large-R jets are required to have p T > 200 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.0.",

The prior for each of the nuisance parameters is taken to be the normal distribution, where a value of 0 corresponds to the nominal prediction, and \u00b11 to the symmetric variation by one standard deviation. The uncertainties on the expected numbers of events in each bin (S i , B i ) are propagated to \u00b5 through these parameters. They also allow the control regions to improve the description of the data, and to reduce the impact of systematic uncertainties in the signal region. The strongest reduction is achieved for the normalisation uncertainty on the W +jets background, which becomes 10% after the fit, compared to the about 40% before the fit. The largest uncertainties are due to the JES, the b-tagging, and the background normalisation, where the latter is dominant for small masses. Table 5 shows the normalisation variation from the largest systematic uncertainties before and after the fit. The posterior distribution of the nuisance parameters after the fit of the background-only (\u00b5 = 0) hypothesis to the data is used to compute post-fit event yields, to normalise the distributions in the control plots, and to check for agreement between data and the background prediction in many variables. Given that the best-fit values of the nuisance parameters were found to be compatible between the individual regions, the nuisance parameters are treated as fully correlated between the regions. The post-fit event yields for the B and b * signal regions together with their systematic uncertainties are listed in the tables 3 and 4.

Limits are set for B and b * models by combining the results from the single-lepton and dilepton channels. The b * models with f g = f L = f R = 1 and decay to Wt are excluded up to masses of 1500 GeV at 95% CL. Upper limits on the production cross-sections times branching ratios for different vectorlike B and excited b * quark masses are also provided. The b * limit is an improvement over the previous ATLAS result and yields similar exclusion limits as the recent CMS result. The cross section limit on the single production of vector-like B quarks extends the set of existing B searches into the Wt final state using a novel approach for boosted eventtopologies.
