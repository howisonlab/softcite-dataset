In recent years the LHCb collaboration reported the first observation of a two-body charmless baryonic B + decay and the first evidence for a similar B 0 decay, namely B + \u2192 p\u039b(1520) [2] and B 0 \u2192 pp [3]. No other two-body charmless baryonic B decay modes have been observed. Their experimental study requires large data samples, presently only available at the LHC, as baryonic B decays to two-body final states are suppressed, with branching fractions typically one to two orders of magnitude lower than similar baryonic decays to multibody final states.",

The B + \u2192 p\u039b decay mode is expected to be dominated by a b \u2192 s loop transition, but tree-level (V ub suppressed) and annihilation diagrams also contribute. Various theoretical predictions for its branching fraction are available. Calculations based on QCD sum rules [4] predict a branching fraction smaller than 3 \u00d7 10 \u22126 whereas a pole model [5] and a recent study [6], taking into account the LHCb experimental result on the B 0 \u2192 pp branching fraction [3], both predict a branching fraction around 2 \u00d7 10 \u22127 . The violation of partial conservation of the axial-vector current at the GeV scale has been proposed as an alternative approach to the understanding of the data available on two-body baryonic decays of B and D + s mesons [7]. It explains the LHCb results on the B 0 (s) \u2192 pp decay modes [3] and predicts a branching fraction for the B + \u2192 p\u039b decay of the order of 10 \u22128 .",

The LHCb detector [10,11] is a single-arm forward spectrometer covering the pseudorapidity range 2 < \u03b7 < 5, designed for the study of particles containing b or c quarks. The detector includes a high-precision tracking system consisting of a silicon-strip vertex detector surrounding the pp interaction region, a large-area silicon-strip detector located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4 Tm, and three stations of silicon-strip detectors and straw drift tubes placed downstream of the magnet. The tracking system provides a measurement of momentum, p, of charged particles with a relative uncertainty that varies from 0.5% at low momentum to 1.0% at 200 GeV/c. The minimum distance of a track to a primary vertex (PV), the impact parameter (IP), is measured with a resolution of (15+29/p T ) \u00b5m, where p T is the component of the momentum transverse to the beam, in GeV/c. The different types of charged hadrons are distinguished using information from two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors. Photons, electrons and hadrons are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter and a hadronic calorimeter.

The MLPs are trained with simulated samples to represent the signals and with data from the high-mass sideband in the range 5350-6420 MeV/c 2 for the background, to avoid partially reconstructed backgrounds. For the well-known K 0 S \u03c0 + spectra both low-and high-mass sidebands are used. The training and selection is performed separately for each period of data taking (the 2012a and 2012b samples are merged) and for downstream and long samples. Optimisation biases are avoided by splitting each of these samples into three disjoint subsamples: each MLP is trained on a different subsample in such a way that events used to train one MLP are classified with another. The response of the MLPs is uncorrelated with the mass of the p\u039b and K 0 S \u03c0 + final states. The MLP training relies on an accurate description of the distributions of the input variables in simulated events. The agreement between data and simulation is verified with kinematic distributions from B + \u2192 K 0 S \u03c0 + decays, where the combinatorial background in the invariant mass spectrum is statistically suppressed using the sPlot technique [25]. No significant deviations are found, giving confidence that the inputs to the MLPs represent the data reliably.

The input variables are the following: the \u03c7 2 per degree of freedom of the kinematic fit of the decay chain; the B + decay length, \u03c7 2 IP and direction angle; the difference between the z-positions of the B + and the V 0 decay vertices divided by its uncertainty squared; the bachelor particle p T ; and the p T of the V 0 decay products.

The systematic uncertainties assigned to the measurement of the B + \u2192 p\u039b branching fraction are summarised in table 1. The uncertainty on the branching fraction of the normalisation channel, B(B + \u2192 K 0 S \u03c0 + ) = (11.895 \u00b1 0.375) \u00d7 10 \u22126 [30] (assuming that half of the K 0 mesons decay as a K 0 S ), is taken as a systematic uncertainty. The uncertainties on the branching fractions B(\u039b \u2192 p\u03c0 \u2212 ) = (63.9 \u00b1 0.5)% and B(K 0 S \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) = (69.20 \u00b1 0.05)% are accounted for, but omitted from the table as they are negligible compared to all other sources of systematic uncertainty.",

A systematic uncertainty is assigned to take into account possible differences in the trigger efficiencies between data and simulation, following the procedure and studies JHEP04(2017)162 described in ref. [31]. The B + \u2192 K 0 S \u03c0 + mode is used as a proxy for the assessment of the systematic uncertainties related to the MLP selection. Distributions for the B + \u2192 K 0 S \u03c0 + MLP input variables are obtained from data using the sPlot technique. The distributions from simulation showing the largest discrepancies are weighted to match those of the data. The selection efficiencies are recalculated with the same MLPs, but using the weighted distributions, to derive the variations in efficiency, and hence the systematic uncertainty on the selection. The uncertainty associated with the imperfect knowledge of PID selection efficiencies is assessed varying the binning of the PID control samples in track momentum and pseudorapidity, and also accounting for a dependence of the efficiency on the event track multiplicity after weighting the distribution of the latter to match that of the data. The two uncertainties are combined in quadrature.",
