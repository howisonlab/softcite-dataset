In all frames the polar coefficient \u03bb \u03b8 is strongly negative at low pT and becomes close to zero at high pT , while the azimuthal coefficient \u03bb \u03c6 is close to zero at low pT , and becomes slightly negative at higher pT . The frame-independent coefficient\u03bb is strongly negative at all pT in all frames. The data are compared to the theoretical predictions provided by nonrelativistic quantum chromodynamics models.",

Because the energy scale of the heavy quark mass is larger than the hadronization scale, nonrelativistic QCD (NRQCD) techniques can be applied to provide theoretical access to hadronization. Charmonium, the bound state of a charm and anti-charm quark, is an especially convenient laboratory as it decays with a considerable branching fraction into two leptons. It is composed of two moderately heavy quarks, and is more copiously available than bottomonium (a bottom and anti-bottom bound state).",

The nonrelativistic operators O are parametrized from experimental results. Several models have been proposed for the production of J/\u03c8 mesons, each one with a different interpretation of these intermediate states. The Color Evaporation Model (CEM) [2], applied only to hadronic collisions, assumes that the nonrelativistic amplitude is constant from twice the charm quark mass to twice the D meson mass and zero elsewhere. All relativistic diagrams to a fixed order in \u03b1 s producing a charm and anti-charm quark in the final state are included. The original Color-Singlet Model (CSM) [3] explicitly requires the cc pair produced in the hard scattering to be on-shell and in the same quantum state as the hadronized J/\u03c8 ( 2S+1 L J = 3 S 1 ). The nonrelativistic amplitude is taken as the real-space J/\u03c8 wave function evaluated at the origin. Early calculations of the CSM at LO in \u03b1 s under-predicted cross sections at CDF [4] and PHENIX [5]. Recent calculations at next-to-leading order (NLO) [6,7] and next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) [8] increase the predicted cross section. NRQCD calculations [1] predict nonnegligible contributions from cc production in the color-octet configuration, leading to a larger cross section and better agreement with data than the current CSM calculations.",

The smooth variation occurs between measurements from fixed targets by E866/NuSea [13] and HERA-B [14], as well as a collider environment by CDF [15]. The transformation of the measurements depends on the assumption that the\u1e91-axis of the CS frame is the natural frame, along which the J/\u03c8 spin-alignment is purely longitudinal or transverse. The assumption is based on measurements of the angular distribution for inclusive J/\u03c8 decays from fixed target p + N collisions at HERA-B covering p T < 5 GeV/c and \u22120.3 < x F < 0.1 [14]. It has been predicted that the natural frame at large p T is near to but not identically along the CS\u1e91-axis [16]. Subsequent work reported in [17] obtained equations which could convert the angular parameters measured in one frame to another frame rotated around the\u0177-axis. A combination of polar and azimuthal constants can be arranged to form a frame-invariant angular decay coefficient",

Numerical estimates [21,22] in the NRQCD approach and recent calculations at NLO [23] predict a transverse spin-alignment in the HX frame at p T M J/\u03c8 due to gluon fragmentation, which disagrees in both sign and magnitude with data from CDF [15].

Even after the tuning described at the beginning of this chapter, small additional p T and rapidity weights were still required to match the J/\u03c8's p T and rapidity distributions in pythia to those measured experimentally. A systematic uncertainty, correlated between data points, was introduced to account for a possible mismatch between the p T and rapidity distributions in simulation and data. This systematic uncertainty was estimated by varying the p T and rapidity weights in simulation by 10%, or one standard deviation of the fits to the data (see Section III D for details). Because the detector acceptance in the simulation is sensitive to the input asymmetry in the decay muon distributions, the final step in the simulation was to apply angular decay coefficients obtained in the initial iteration as weights in the simulation, thus imitating the observed J/\u03c8 polarization.",

The frame-independent coefficient\u03bb is strongly negative at all p T in all frames. Consistency of\u03bb values in all polarization frames indicates that systematic uncertainties are well under control. The obtained polarization coefficient\u03bb is in good agreement with what was reported by the STAR experiment [31], for the same \u221a s at midrapidity and higher transverse momentum. At the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the LHCb experiment [32] reported similar, although smaller values of \u03bb \u03b8 with similar trend in transverse momentum at forward rapidity. \u03bb \u03b8 measured by the ALICE experiment [33] at forward rapidity is consistent with no polarization, although, within experimental uncertainty, it can be said to be similar to the LHCb result. A very comprehensive CMS measurement [34] indicates that both \u03bb \u03b8 and\u03bb are consistent with zero. However, note that the CMS measurement covers much a higher transverse momentum range and for more central rapidities.",

Chung et al. [29] and H. Shao [30] in Fig. 6. At high transverse momentum both predictions are in good agreement with the data, while at low p T a strong deviation can be seen. While theory expects \u03bb \u03b8 to be small and slightly positive at low p T , it is strongly negative in the data. The polar coefficient result in the Helicity frame poses a challenge to the NRQCD effective theory at low p T , where perturbative calculations are more difficult to compute. No theoretical calculation is available for the frame-independent coefficient \u03bb or for other reference frames. The reported experimental results represent a challenge for the theory and provide a basis for better understanding of quarkonium production in high energy p+p collisions.",
