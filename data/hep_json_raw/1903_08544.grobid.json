Data from the scattering of 27.6 GeV electrons and positrons off gaseous hydrogen and deuterium targets were collected by the HERMES experiment. The asymmetries are presented separately as a function of the Bjorken scaling variable, the hadron transverse momentum, and the fractional energy for charged pions and kaons as well as for protons and anti-protons. These asymmetries are also presented as a function of the three aforementioned kinematic variables simultaneously.",

            "text": "The distribution of partons inside a nucleon, N, and their fragmentation into hadrons, h, have received so far most theoretical and experimental attention at leading twist, i.e., at twist 2 (see Refs. [1][2][3][4][5] for review). Using the \"working definition\" of twist, twist t refers to the power suppression 2 \u2212 t of the hard scale of the process through which the nucleon structure and hadron formation is studied [6]. Twist-2 parton distribution functions (PDFs) have a probabilistic interpretation in terms of finding a parton inside a nucleon as a function of its fraction of the nucleon longitudinal momentum, x, in a frame where the latter tends to infinity. Similarly, twist-2 fragmentation functions (FFs) describe the probability of a parton to fragment into a hadron as a function of the hadron fractional energy with respect to that of the gauge boson exchanged in the process. Transverse-momentum-dependent (TMD) PDFs and FFs include in addition the dependence on the transverse momentum of respectively the struck parton inside the nucleon and the formed hadron with respect to the direction of the fragmenting parton. For PDFs as well as for FFs, spin-independent and spin-dependent configurations of either or both parton and nucleon can be considered, and correlations between spin and transverse momentum can be probed. At leading twist, there exist eight quark TMD PDFs for the spin- 1 2 nucleon and eight quark single-hadron TMD FFs. The majority of these vanishes when integrating over transverse momentum.",

(1), where for each pair one of the functions is of twist 2, as indicated by the subscript 1, while the other is of twist 3. The functions are also combined such that either the PDF or the FF is naive-T-odd, recognizable here from the superscript \u22a5, while the other is T-even. Since the strong interaction conserves chirality, a chiral-odd PDF always appears in pair with a chiral-odd FF, e.g., e and H \u22a5 1 . The first pair in Eq. (1) is a convolution of the twist-2 Collins FF, mentioned above, and the spin-independent, twist-3 PDF e [10,27]. The genuine twist-3 component of this PDF, following the Wandzura-Wilczek decomposition, 3 describes the actual quarkgluon-quark correlations. This component can be related to the force exerted on the struck quark by the nucleon remnant at the instant of time that the quark absorbs the virtual photon [30]. This interpretation applies to transversely polarized quarks inside an unpolarized nucleon, i.e., for the Boer-Mulders distribution. The PDF e is linked via equation-of-motion relations to the spinindependent PDF f 1 . In this relation, the latter appears quark-mass suppressed [31].",

Tracking of electrically charged particles was performed with the help of a 1.5 Tm dipole magnet and drift chambers located upstream and downstream of the magnet, resulting in an average relative momentum resolution of 1.5%. Discrimination of leptons and hadrons was performed by a transition-radiation detector, a lead-scintillator preshower, and a lead-glass electromagnetic calorimeter. Typically, a lepton-identification efficiency above 98% with a misidentification of less than 1% is obtained with this system. The identification of pions was made possible through the use of a threshold Cherenkov counter in the years 1996-1997. This detector was replaced in 1998 by a dual-radiator ring-imaging Cherenkov detector [55] in order to enable the separation of pions, kaons, and protons.

This parametrization is implemented in a Monte Carlo simulation that does not include polarization effects. The statistical precision of this simulation exceeds that of the experimental data by a factor of ten. A beam helicity is assigned to each simulated event according to the implemented asymmetry. The difference between the implemented asymmetry, evaluated at the average reconstructed kinematics, and the one extracted from the fully processed Monte Carlo simulation following the same analysis procedure as for experimental data is assigned as systematic uncertainty. This uncertainty is the dominant systematic uncertainty. If the dependence of the asymmetry or the acceptance on the kinematic variables is highly non-linear, large differences between the implemented asymmetry and that extracted from the Monte Carlo simulation can arise, especially for the one-dimensional asymmetries, where one integrates over a larger portion of phase space. Hence, since the extracted asymmetries do not exhibit significant non-linear dependences, the extracted systematic uncertainties due to detector effects are, as observed, larger for measurements in one dimension than for those in three dimensions. In addition, as in general the dependence is different for the various kinematic variables, it is natural to obtain from the present procedure systematic uncertainties for the various kinematic dependences that differ in size. Both systematic uncertainties discussed so far are added in quadrature. In addition, a 3% scale uncertainty from the beam-polarization measurement is assigned. The influence of additional azimuthal modulations [sin(2\u03c6), cos(\u03c6), and cos(2\u03c6), where the first is a beam-helicitydependent contribution and the other two are spin-independent contributions to the cross section] on the extracted sin(\u03c6) amplitude was also evaluated, and found to be negligible. For this study, these modulations were added as additional parameters or existing parameterizations of the cosine modulations [56] were included in the likelihood function.",

The error bars represent the statistical uncertainties, while the error bands represent systematic uncertainties. In addition, there is a systematic uncertainty for the HERMES results originating from the measurement of the beam polarization, corresponding to a scale factor of 3%. in Fig. 2 for data collected on a hydrogen target (closed symbols) and on a deuterium target (open symbols). The error bars represent the statistical uncertainties, while the error bands are the systematic uncertainties discussed previously. As can be seen, the statistical and systematic uncertainties are of the same order of magnitude. The data points of the last two bins in z, plotted in grey, are not included in the presentations of the asymmetry amplitudes as a function of x B and P h\u22a5 . As already stated, the motivation for this lies in the suppression of contributions from exclusive processes. Nevertheless, it is interesting to also inspect the asymmetry amplitudes at high z, covering the transition region between semi-inclusive DIS and exclusive processes. The presentation of the asymmetry as a function of z is restricted to z below 0.7 for anti-protons due to limited statistical precision.",

(2) the prefactor 1/Q i and determining its value for each event. This allows for a comparison between both experimental results free from the explicit 1/Q factor appearing in Eq. (1). The most salient observation from this figure is the opposite sign of the asymmetry amplitudes for negatively charged pions as a function of z seen by the two experiments. As can be seen from the projection in x B , the data from the CLAS experiment are located at larger values in x B . In the expression for the structure function F sin(\u03c6) LU from Eq. (1), the pairs eH \u22a5 1 and g \u22a5 D 1 appear weighted with x B , and thus suppressed at smaller x B values. The Collins FFs for up quarks extracted from data from electron-positron annihilation [59][60][61] and semi-inclusive DIS [62][63][64][65] are positive for positively charged pions, and negative for negatively charged pions. Therefore, if eH \u22a5 1 forms the dominant contribution to the structure function F sin(\u03c6) LU and scattering takes predominantly place off an up quark, opposite signs are expected for the asymmetries for positive and negative pions. A positive asymmetry is indeed observed for positively charged pions, while a negative asymmetry is seen for negatively charged pions for the CLAS measurement, which probes the valence-quark region. On the other hand, the asymmetries from the present paper, sensitive to lower values of x B , are positive for both positively and negatively charged pions. This could hint at the dominance of contributions from different pairs of PDFs and FFs appearing in Eq. (1).",
