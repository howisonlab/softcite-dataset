However, GR is formulated as a classical theory, and merging it with quantum physics in a consistent manner may well demand changes in its foundational structure. Even if local Lorentz invariance is exact in the underlying theory of quantum gravity, spontaneous breaking of this symmetry may occur, leading to tiny observable effects [1]. Experimental studies of Lorentz invariance are therefore valuable as probes of the foundations of GR.",

To attain sensitivity at short range without being overwhelmed by Newton forces at larger scales, the test masses are typically scaled to that range. Experiments of this type are well suited, for example, to searching for deviations from the gravitational inversesquare law.",

The presence of four derivatives implies corrections to the Newton force that are inverse quartic and hence appear only at short range. The rotation violation implies effects in the laboratory depending on orientation and also on sidereal time due to the rotation of the Earth, thereby ensuring that the resulting experimental signals are distinct from those associated with conventional Yukawa or inverse-power corrections. The extra term offers a general description of dominant noncentral short-range corrections to Newton gravity arising from an underlying unified theory.",

            "text": "The design and operation of the experiment is described elsewhere [8][9][10]. Here, we summarize briefly the basic features. Each of the two test masses is a planar tungsten oscillator of approximate thickness 250 \u00b5m, separated by a gap of about 80 \u00b5m, arranged as shown in Fig. 1. A stiff conducting shield is placed between them to suppress electrostatic and acoustic backgrounds. The planar geometry concentrates as much mass as possible at the scale of interest while being nominally null with respect to inverse-square forces, thereby suppressing the Newton background relative to new short-range effects. The force-sensitive 'detector' mass is driven by the forcegenerating 'source' mass at a resonance near 1 kHz. Vi-bration isolation is a key requirement for this setup, and operation at 1 kHz is chosen because at this frequency a comparatively simple passive vibration-isolation system can be used. The entire apparatus is enclosed in a vacuum chamber and operated at 10 \u22127 torr to minimize the acoustic coupling. Detector oscillations are read out via capacitive transducer probes coupled to a sensitive differential amplifier, with the signal fed to a lock-in amplifier referenced by the same waveform used to drive the source mass. This design has proved effective in suppressing all background forces to the extent that only thermal noise is observed, arising from dissipation in the detector mass. The output of the lock-in amplifier constitutes the raw data. These data are converted to force readings by comparison with the detector thermal noise, the scale of which is determined using the equipartition theorem [8]. Following data collection in 2002, this experiment set the strongest limits on unobserved forces of nature between 10 and 100 \u00b5m [9]. The apparatus has since been optimized to explore gaps below 50 \u00b5m, and operation at the thermal noise limit has recently been demonstrated [10].",

Following standard convention, we extract values of these observables in the canonical Sun-centered frame [3,28], with Z axis along the direction of the Earth's rotation and X axis pointing towards the vernal equinox. As the Earth rotates, the coefficients measured in the laboratory vary with sidereal time T . The Earth's boost \u03b2 \u2295 \u2243 10 \u22124 can be neglected here. The transformation from the Sun-centered frame (X, Y, Z) to the laboratory frame (x, y, z) therefore involves a time-dependent rotation R jJ (T ) [5] that depends on the Earth's sidereal frequency \u03c9 \u2295 \u2243 2\u03c0/(23 h 56 min) and the colatitude \u03c7 of the laboratory, which is 0.887 in Bloomington and 0.872 in Boulder.

Performing the numerical integration for a hypothetical geometry with an average gap an order of magnitude larger than the largest dimension of either mass produces a result agreeing to within a few percent with the analytical expression for point masses of the same mass and separation. This limiting case confirms that some contributions from (k eff ) JKLM are resolvable only due to the planar geometry. Figure 2 displays the force data acquired during the runs in 2012 and in 2002 as a function of the sidereal time T measured in seconds from T = 0, which is taken to be the 2000 vernal equinox. The force data were collected at a 1 Hz rate in 14.4-minute sets (2012 run) and in 12-minute sets (2002 run), with comparable intervals between each set during which diagnostic data were taken to monitor the experiment for gain and frequency drifts. Each data point represents the mean of a 14.4-or 12minute set. Each error bar shown is the 1\u03c3 standard deviation of the mean, including both the statistical uncertainty and the systematic errors associated with the force calibration.

(5) and (6), and the variance \u03c3 2 k includes all statistical and systematic errors. An independent measurement of any one chosen component of (k eff ) JKLM can in principle be obtained by integrating the global probability distribution P over all other components. The result is a distribution involving the chosen component with a single mean and standard deviation, which constitute the estimated component measurement and its error. However, the 2012 dataset alone contains only nine signal components, which is insufficient to constrain independently each of the 15 degrees of freedom in (k eff ) JKLM . Following standard practice in the field [3], we can obtain maximum-sensitivity constraints on each component of (k eff ) JKLM in turn by integrating the global probability distribution with the other 14 degrees of freedom set to zero. The resulting measurements and 2\u03c3 errors on each independent component of (k eff ) JKLM are displayed in the first two columns of Table II. Note that the first column reveals our choice for the 15 independent components of (k eff ) JKLM . Note also that the sensitivity of the apparatus to the coefficients (k eff ) JKLM can be crudely estimated as the ratio of the thermal-noise force at the location of the probe (\u223c10 fN) to the scale (\u223c10 \u00b5N/m 2 ) of the amplitudes in the Fourier series (6), multiplied by a suppression factor of order 10 \u22122 because the dominant contribution to the noncentral force in a parallel-plate geometry arises from edge effects [29]. This estimate matches the size of the values in the second column of Table II.",

The inverse-quartic dependence implies the corrections are perturbative at squared distances greater than the coefficient values. For example, the perturbative effects at the apparatus scale are roughly comparable to the Newton force, while on the macroscopic scale of the laboratory the attained constraints exclude noncentral forces at about parts in ten million. An alternative perspective can be obtained by comparing the length dimension associated with the coefficients (k eff ) JKLM to the various scales set by the Compton wavelengths of elementary particles. The experiment here probes modifications governed to within about an order of magnitude of the scale of the neutrino Compton wavelength. Effects at the scales of Compton wavelengths of other particles would be smaller, reflecting the possibility that comparatively large 'countershaded' Lorentz violation remains a viable possibility [30].",

For example, upgrading the apparatus used by improving the test-mass and shield flatness could reduce the average gap by a factor of two, and refining the testmass metrology could reduce the uncertainty in the average gap by a factor of four. Simulations suggest these improvements would increase the overall sensitivity by more than an order of magnitude in the absence of new systematics. With several months of run time, the statistical error bars could be reduced by about another order of magnitude. Moreover, other experimental groups also have the capability of improving substantially over the results in the present work [5]. For example, the HUST experiment has recently reported sensitivities to the coefficients (k eff ) JKLM surpassing those reported here [29]. Overall, the prospects for improved future short-range searches for Lorentz violation are excellent.",
