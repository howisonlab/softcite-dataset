The multiplicity dependence of identified particle yields is presented for \u221a s = 7 and 13 TeV and discussed in the context of the results obtained in protonlead (p-Pb) and lead-lead (Pb-Pb) collisions, unveiling remarkable and intriguing similarities. The production rates of strange hadrons are observed to increase more than those of non-strange particles, showing an enhancement pattern with multiplicity which does not depend on the collision energy. Even if the multiplicity dependence of spectral shapes can be qualitatively described by commonly-used Monte Carlo (MC) event generators, the evolution of integrated yield ratios is poorly described by these models.",

Even more remarkably, a similar behavior was observed for particle production in high multiplicity pp collisions [3]. Features like baryonto-meson ratio enhancement at intermediate transverse momentum (p T ) in Pb-Pb collisions are understood as a consequence of quark coalescence [4] or radial flow [5]. The latter is characteristic to hydrodynamical expansion of the system and its presence might require a fireball in local thermodynamical (kinetic) equilibrium. Similar dynamics observed in smaller systems such as pp or p-Pb, where hydrodynamics was assumed to be not applicable due to the absence of a QGP phase, can be explained by certain QCD effects like color reconnection [6,7].",

A hit in either V0 scintillators or in the SPD in coincidence with signals from beam pick-up counters was used for MB triggering and events containing more than one primary vertex within |z| < 10 cm were discarded as pileup. Acceptance and efficiency corrections were calculated from simulations, using PYTHIA8 (Monash-2013 tune) [6] as particle generator and GEANT3 for describing particle transport in the ALICE detector.

To avoid auto-correlations, event activity classes were selected using signals in the V0 detector -two scintillator arrays covering \u22123.7 < \u03b7 < \u22121.7 and 2.8 < \u03b7 < 5.1 [1].",

While there is no significant evolution of K/\u03c0 ratios with \u221a s, the peak of p/\u03c0 ratio shifts to slightly higher values of p T with the increase of \u221a s. Note that a minor modification of baryon-to-meson ratio is expected considering a small increase in dN ch /d\u03b7 with \u221a s [13]. A comparison to PYTHIA8 predictions reveals that not only K/\u03c0 and p/\u03c0 ratios are not described, but also the evolution of p/\u03c0 ratio with \u221a s is not captured within the generator framework. The p T -integrated proton-and hyperon-to-pion ratios as a function of center-of-mass energy have previously been shown in [7]. While p/\u03c0 ratios saturate at LHC energies, \u039e/\u03c0 and \u03a9/\u03c0 ratios exhibit hints of an increase between MB pp collisions at \u221a s = 7 and 13 TeV.

We observe similar particle abundances at similar final state multiplicities for the two different center-of-mass energies, indicating that particle production is dominantly driven by the event activity and not by \u221a s. The increase of yields with dN ch /d\u03b7 is stronger for hadrons with larger strangeness content, and given the saturation of p/\u03c0 [3,7], it indicates that this effect is related to strangeness enhancement (suppression) in large (small) systems and not to the baryonic number. A comparison to Monte Carlo predictions shows that the existing generators do not capture the evolution of (multi-) strange hadron yields with dN ch /d\u03b7 : while both PYTHIA6/PYTHIA8 [6] and EPOS-LHC [14] describe K 0 s yields well, discrepancies between model predictions and data grow for baryons with larger strangeness content.",

To isolate the impact of \u221a s on final state observables, measurements in pp were performed for two different center-of-mass energies, 7 and 13 TeV. We observe a small blueshift of the maximum in p T -differential p/\u03c0 spectra ratio at \u221a s = 13 TeV as compared to lower energies, while no evolution is seen in K/\u03c0. The p T -integrated p/\u03c0 ratios saturate at LHC energies, while hyperon-over-pion ratios hint towards a small increase between \u221a s =7 and 13 TeV. The integrated hadron yields show a very good scaling behavior with event activity and are very similar at comparable dN ch /d\u03b7 for different collision energies. On the other hand, p T of K 0 s exhibits an increase in \u221a s = 13 TeV pp collisions as compared to 7 TeV. This indicates that the hadrochemistry is dominantly driven by dN ch /d\u03b7 , even though the dynamics of particle production might be different at different energies.
