The main goal of the experiments was to measure the large mixing-induced CP violation in the B 0 system predicted by the theory of Kobayashi and Maskawa [3]. The experimental data indicated that the Kobayashi-Maskawa mechanism is indeed the dominant source of the observed CP violation in Nature. Following the experimental confirmation, M. Kobayashi and T. Maskawa were awarded the 2008 Nobel Prize for physics.",

Currently, most of the CKM parameters are well measured and a room for a new physics is rather small (Fig. 1 left).
