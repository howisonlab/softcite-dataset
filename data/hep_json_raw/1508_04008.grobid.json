An observable is introduced and shown to be very robust against detector asymmetries while keeping a large sensitivity to the physical charge asymmetry that results from the interference between initial and final state radiation. The asymmetry is determined as a function of the invariant mass of the final-state tracks from production threshold to a few GeV/c 2 . It is compared to the expectation from QED for e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 \u03b3, and from theoretical models for e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b3. A clear interference pattern is observed in e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b3, particularly in the vicinity of the f2(1270) resonance. The inferred rate of lowest order FSR production is consistent with the QED expectation for e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 \u03b3, and is negligibly small for e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b3.",

            "text": "The radiative processes e + e \u2212 \u2192 X\u03b3 (1) have been extensively studied by several e + e \u2212 experiments and the cross sections for e + e \u2212 \u2192 X have been measured using the initial state radiation (ISR) method [1][2][3][4]. At BABAR [5], the cross sections have thus been determined in large energy ranges below the total e + e \u2212 center-of-mass (c.m.) energy \u221a s \u223c 10.58 GeV available at the SLAC PEP-II collider. The state X can be either fully described by Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) such as \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 , or any hadronic state with J P C = 1 \u2212\u2212 . In reaction (1) at lowest order (LO) the photon can be emitted from either the incoming electron or positron, or from the final state (final state radiation, or FSR). At BABAR, the kinematic conditions are such that the process is dominated by ISR photons, which justifies the ISR method. The LO FSR contribution to the hadronic radiative process is neglected, as its theoretical estimates are well below the systematic uncertainties of the cross section measurement. This is due to the fact that the available e + e \u2212 c.m. energy is far beyond the domain of the hadronic resonances that dominate the cross-section, so that hadronic form factors considerably reduce the probability that the photon is emitted from the final * Now at: University of Tabuk, Tabuk 71491, Saudi Arabia \u2020 Now at: Laboratoire de Physique Nucl\u00e9aire et de Hautes Energies, IN2P3/CNRS, F-75252 Paris, France \u2021 Now at: Institute of High Energy Physics, Beijing 100039, China \u00a7 Now at: University of Huddersfield, Huddersfield HD1 3DH, UK \u00b6 Deceased * * Now at: University of South Alabama, Mobile, Alabama 36688, USA \u2020 \u2020 Also at: Universit\u00e0 di Sassari, I-07100 Sassari, Italy state. However, the theoretical estimations are modeldependent, and it is thus important to have a direct experimental proof of the smallness of the FSR contribution to the hadronic cross sections when high precision is at stake, as for the determination of the hadronic contribution to the g \u2212 2 value of the muon [6]. Because of the point-like nature of the muon, the FSR reduction does not occur for the e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 \u03b3 process. The LO FSR contribution to the cross section is expected to vanish at threshold and to increase with the invariant mass of the muon pair (m \u00b5\u00b5 ). Still, the FSR fraction remains small for low di-muon mass (less than 1% for m \u00b5\u00b5 < 1 GeV/c 2 ). For the e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 \u03b3 cross section measurement, a correction is applied for the LO FSR contribution as a function of m \u00b5\u00b5 , which is so far determined by turning off FSR in the Monte Carlo (MC) generation.",

The comparison between the QED prediction and the measurement is done for the charge asymmetry in e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 \u03b3. Various FSR models are discussed for e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b3, and the most realistic quark-FSR model is compared to the measurement of the charge asymmetry in that channel.",

The effect from the muon mass is sizeable, especially at large m \u00b5\u00b5 when the radiated photon is close to one of the muons. Predictions for the charge asymmetry in the massive case are obtained by numerical integration of several variants of the QED differential cross section [9][10][11]. The phase space considered in those calculations is limited to the experimental acceptance 20 \u2022 < \u03b8 * \u03b3 < 160 \u2022 , and the results are shown in Fig. 4 as a function of m \u00b5\u00b5 . Predictions differ at the physical threshold (m \u00b5\u00b5 = 2m \u00b5 ), where only the charge asymmetry based on Ref. [11] extrapolates to zero as expected, suggesting that the validity of formulae in Ref. [9,10] does not extend to small m \u00b5\u00b5 . At large mass (m \u00b5\u00b5 > 3 GeV/c 2 ), the prediction from Ref. [9] differs from the others by up to a few percent. The formula of the differential LO cross section implemented in the AfkQed generator, which is used in this analysis for simulation (see Sec. IV B), is the one by Arbuzov et al. [11], which has the most reliable behavior over the full m \u00b5\u00b5 range.",

In this hypothesis, the FSR amplitude M FSR is proportional to the pion form factor at the collision energy squared s, namely F \u03c0 (s). The ISR amplitude M ISR shown in Fig. 5(a) is proportional to the pion form factor F \u03c0 (s ) at a reduced energy squared s = s(1 \u2212 2E * \u03b3 / \u221a s). According to this FSR model, the charge asymmetry to be measured at BABAR reflects the relative magnitude of the pion form factor at \u221a s = 10.58 GeV and at low energy. It is consequently negligibly small, since F \u03c0 (s ), dominated by the \u03c1 resonance in the s = m 2 \u03c0\u03c0 domain accessible to the experiment, is three orders of magnitude larger than |F \u03c0 (10.58 2 GeV 2 )| \u223c 0.01, as estimated from an extrapolation of existing data [6,12] using a 1/s dependence. This model is studied with the PHOKHARA 4.0 [13] generator, in which the FSR current has a point-like Lorentz structure, including a contact term, globally multiplied by the pion form factor. In this model, the A 0 (m \u03c0\u03c0 ) distribution is expected to increase quadratically with mass on the \u03c1 resonance, with a change of sign at the \u03c1 mass",

For the \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 \u03b3 process these corrections have been computed recently [17] and implemented in the PHOKHARA 9.0 generator [18]. As discussed in Sec. VI C, the effects are found to be small, at the percent level for the experimental conditions of the present analysis, and to be well accounted for by the simpler structure function approach implemented in AfkQed. No exact NLO calculation is available for the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b3 process. In this case, since the LO charge asymmetry is expected to be small because the FSR amplitude is suppressed, NLO corrections could play a relatively more important role. The soft and virtual photon contributions to the Born process e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 are known [19,20] to generate an asymmetry of the pion production, with asymmetry values at the percent level at a \u03c0\u03c0 mass of 1 GeV/c 2 . However, it is unclear if the above result can be used in the conditions of the present process e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b3, where one of the incoming electrons is highly off-shell after emission of a hard ISR photon. Furthermore, such an asymmetry would vanish because of the symmetrical integration in cos \u03b8 * . NLO corrections as implemented in AfkQed have indeed no effect on the charge asymmetry. No correction on the measured charge asymmetry is therefore applied for the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b3 process.",

About 10% of the data was collected 40 MeV below the resonance. The BABAR detector is described in detail elsewhere [22]. Charged-particle tracks are measured with a five-layer double-sided silicon vertex tracker (SVT) together with a 40-layer drift chamber (DCH), both inside a 1.5 T superconducting solenoid. Photons are assumed to originate from the primary vertex defined by the chargedparticle tracks of the event, and their energy and position are measured in a CsI(Tl) electromagnetic calorimeter (EMC). Charged-particle identification (PID) uses the ionization energy loss dE/dx in the SVT and DCH, the Cherenkov radiation detected in a ring-imaging device (DIRC), the shower energy deposit (E cal ) in the EMC, and the shower shape in the instrumented flux return (IFR) of the magnet. The IFR system is made of modules of resistive plate chambers (RPC) interspaced with iron slabs, arranged in a layout with a barrel and two endcaps. Collision events are recorded and recon-structed if they pass three levels of trigger (hardware, online software, and offline filter), each using complementary information from the sub-detectors.",

The tracks are required to have at least 15 hits in the DCH, to originate within 5 mm of the collision axis and within 6 cm from the beam spot along the beam direction, and to extrapolate to the DIRC and IFR active areas in order to exclude low-efficiency regions.

The simulation properly corrects known effects after data/MC adjustment of separate sources. The experimental absolute systematic uncertainties on A 0 are estimated to be 0.5\u00d710 \u22122 from MC reweighting, 0.3\u00d710 \u22122 from data/MC efficiency corrections, 0.7\u00d710 \u22122 from acceptance edge effects, which sum up to 0.9\u00d710 \u22122 . In view of the observed differences on A 0 using AfkQed, PHOKHARA 9.0 (LO and NLO) and KKMC (with and without EW corrections), we conservatively set a 1.0\u00d710 \u22122 systematic uncertainty on the theoretical prediction.

To keep backgrounds at manageable levels, the higher momen- tum pion is required to satisfy the tighter identification criteria of a 'hard \u03c0' [6]. To further reduce the electron contamination, an enhanced E cal /p < 0.6 selection is applied to the high momentum track, and the ionization energy loss in the DCH of the low momentum track is required to be below the average electron loss (dE/dx DCH < 650). The corresponding efficiencies are obtained separately from the full simulation of e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b3 events in the low and high | cos \u03b8 * | regions. While the effective | cos \u03b8 * | range is limited to | cos \u03b8 * | < 0.8 with the standard event selection, the specific selection applied in the high | cos \u03b8 * | region allows to extend the asymmetry measurement up to | cos \u03b8 * | \u223c 0.95. Backgrounds are estimated accordingly using the full simulation of relevant processes. After background subtraction and overall acceptance correction, the charge asymmetries obtained for | cos \u03b8 * | below and above 1/ \u221a 3 are shown in Fig. 23. Since a large fraction of the events in the standard analysis are in the low | cos \u03b8 * | region, the charge asymmetry measured with | cos \u03b8 * | < 1/ \u221a 3 is quite close to the one obtained using the full sample (Fig. 22). Although limited by statistics, the charge asymmetry measured in the high | cos \u03b8 * | region presents the opposite sign oscillation around the f 2 (1270) mass, which is the expected pattern. The change of sign between | cos \u03b8 * | < 1/ \u221a 3 and | cos \u03b8 * | > 1/ \u221a 3, and the opposite variation across the resonance provide a solid validation that the observed charge asymmetry around the f 2 (1270) resonance is indeed due to the interference between the two amplitudes for e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b3 ISR \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b3 FSR f 2 (1270)(\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ), with f 2 in the helicity 0 state. In the mass range below 1 GeV/c 2 , the asymmetry keeps the same (negative) sign in the two | cos \u03b8 * | regions, as expected for the interference with a scalar amplitude flat in | cos \u03b8 * |.",

As shown in Fig. 25, the fitted slopes A 0 deviate from the final values by less than 10 \u22123 , except in the background dominated dip region of the cross section (m \u03c0\u03c0 1.5 GeV/c 2 ), where the deviation \u2206A 0 reaches 3\u00d710 \u22122 . In the m \u03c0\u03c0 region where the fit of the theoretical model is performed (0.3-1.4 GeV/c 2 ), the slope A 0 does not change by more than 5\u00d710 \u22124 , except in the last (1.3-1.4 GeV/c 2 ) bin, where the deviation is 2\u00d710 \u22123 . This is consistent with the estimated background contribution to the systematic error. The fitted B 0 values are within 2.5\u03c3 from zero over the full mass range. The average B 0 for m \u03c0\u03c0 < 1 GeV/c 2 is (0.41 \u00b1 0.16) \u00d7 10 \u22122 . Different interaction rates in the detector material for positive and negative pions induce a charge asymmetry. Although such an effect is included in the simulation of the detector response based on GEANT4, its description and the corresponding track loss are known to be somewhat imperfect. Independent studies have shown that data/MC discrepancies occur at the 10% level for both \u03c0 + and \u03c0 \u2212 , in opposite directions. A residual charge asymmetry is thus expected after applying the MC corrections. The effect of imperfect simulation of nuclear interactions is investigated using the large sample of \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b3 events produced by AfkQed at the generator level. A weight is assigned to each track according to its momentum and its path length through detector material as a function of the polar angle, using a \u00b110% relative change in the respective \u03c0 + and \u03c0 \u2212 interaction rates. The charge asymmetry obtained after the interaction reweighting is subjected to the two-parameter linear fit in the integrated mass range from 0.4 to 1.2 GeV/c 2 . The slope A 0 changes by only \u2206A 0 = (\u22120.006 \u00b1 0.024) \u00d7 10 \u22122 , which confirms the robustness of the A 0 observable. The charge asymmetry itself is however modified as the fitted B 0 value is found to be displaced significantly, \u2206B 0 = (0.240\u00b10.016)\u00d710 \u22122 , in good agreement with the observed B 0 value in data in the same mass range. Imperfect simulation of nuclear interactions thus provides a plausible explanation of the small B 0 values found in the analysis, while leaving the A 0 measurement unaffected.",

The primary result of the present interference analysis is to determine the actual size of the |M FSR | 2 cross section, misinterpreted as ISR, and its contribution to the total cross section (|M ISR | 2 + |M FSR | 2 ). Using the FSR model 2, which describes well the measured charge asymmetry in the [0.3-1.4] GeV/c 2 range, the FSR cross section calculated through Eq. (9) with the fitted c 0,2 parameters, is extrapolated to higher masses. The resulting FSR fraction in the BABAR cross section is given in Fig. 29 as a function of m \u03c0\u03c0 . As expected the FSR fraction is negligible in the \u03c1 region, but increases significantly above 1 GeV/c 2 due to the f 2 (1270) contribution and the rapid fall-off of the pion form factor. In fact the FSR 'background' exceeds the estimated systematic uncertainty quoted in Ref.

The FSR contribution is found to be dominant around 1.5 GeV/c 2 , in the region where the ISR cross section displays a deep dip and is consistent with zero within the large errors.",

Because charge parities of the final state pair are opposite for ISR and FSR, the interference between ISR and FSR changes sign with the charge interchange of the two muons (pions). As a consequence, investigation of the charge asymmetry of the process gives a way to study the interference between ISR and FSR, which is sensitive to the relative contribution of LO FSR.",

We find that the detector and event selection, including trigger, tracking, PID, and kinematic fitting, induce nonlinear patterns on the cos \u03c6 * dependence of the charge asymmetry, but have a small impact on the determined slope A 0 . Kinematic acceptance -namely the angular acceptance, and energy or momentum requirements on the final state particles -changes the slope of the observed charge asymmetry significantly, although the kinematic requirements are charge-symmetric. This is due to a cross effect between acceptance and true interference that produces a bias in the measured asymmetry if the physical asymmetry differs between data and MC. This bias is corrected through an iterative procedure in the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b3 analysis, as in that case the charge asymmetry is null in the generator.",

The QED test, namely the comparison between the charge asymmetry measured in the \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 \u03b3 data and predicted by the simulation, in which the LO ISR-FSR interference is implemented, shows an overall good consistency.
