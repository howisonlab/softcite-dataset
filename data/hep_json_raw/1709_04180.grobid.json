A neutrino beam is produced at the J-PARC accelerator in Japan and is sampled at a Near Detector complex 280 m from the neutrino production point and at the far detector, Super-Kamiokande, located 295 km from the source. Beams predominantly composed of muon neutrinos or muon anti-neutrinos have been produced by changing the currents in the magnetic focusing horns. This presentation will show the most recent T2K oscillation results obtained from a combined analysis of the entire available data set in the muon neutrino and muon anti-neutrino disappearance channels, and in the electron neutrino and electron anti-neutrino appearance channels. The data cover runs 1 to 8 (2010 to 2017) and consist of 7.252 \u2022 10 20 POT in neutrino mode and 7.531 \u2022 10 20 POT in antineutrino mode. Using these data, we measure four oscillations parameters: sin 2 \u03b8 23 , sin 2 \u03b8 13 , \u2206m 2 32 and \u03b4 CP . The analysis excludes CP-conservation in the neutrino sector at 90% C.L.",

            "text": "The T2K experiment is a long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment located in Japan [1]. A neutrino beam is created in J-PARC from a 30 GeV proton beam hitting a carbon target, creating charged pions and kaons. Three horns select particles according to their electric charge, so a positive horn current selects positively charged particles decaying into \u00b5 + + \u03bd \u00b5 in order to deliver a neutrino-enhanced beam (refered to as neutrino mode) ; and a negative horn current selects negatively charged particles decaying into \u00b5 \u2212 +\u03bd \u00b5 to deliver an antineutrino-enhanced beam (refered to as antineutrino mode). A negligible amount of mesons decay into \u03bd e and\u03bd e , providing a contamination less than 1%. The neutrino beam energy peaks at 600 MeV as shown on Figure 1, and its direction is monitored on a daily basis by the on-axis INGRID detector located 280m downstream. Above INGRID is located the off-axis near detector ND280, made of several subdetectors embedded in the UA1 magnet providing a 0.2 T horizontal magnetic field as shown on Figure 2 left. The Fine Grained Detectors (FGDs) are the two target detector, the first being composed of fifteen modules, each module containing two layers of extruded polystyrene scintillator bars placed consecutively along x then y to ensure the tracking of the charged particles. The second FGD contains eight similar modules, interlaid with water modules in order to select interactions on oxygen. The two FGDs are placed in between three Time Projection Chambers (TPCs) filled with a gas mixture mainly composed of argon and holding a central cathode creating a linear electric field in the x direction. The charged particles entering the TPC ionise the gas, and can be identified from their energy loss combined with the momentum measurement from the curvature of the particle track in the magnetic field. The \u03c0 0 detector (P\u2205D), electromagnetic calorimeters (ECals) and Side Muon Ranger Detector (SMRD) aim at constraining the background interactions and veto the particles originating from outside the FGDs.",

The third sample contains \u03bd e charged-current charged-pion production (CC-1\u03c0 + ), where an electron is produced with an undetected nucleon and a charged pion, that is selected to be under the Cherenkov threshold and tagged from delayed clusters of photomultipliers hits. Assuming that the reaction occurs with the production of a \u2206 ++ resonance decaying into a pion and nucleon, the neutrino energy can be infered with the equation: where E \u2206 \u03bd is the reconstructed neutrino energy assuming a \u2206 ++ production interaction, and m \u2206 ++ is the mass of the \u2206 ++ . In antineutrino modes, two CCQE samples of\u03bd \u00b5 and\u03bd e interactions are selected. The analysed data cover runs 1 to 8 (from 2010 to 2017) and consist of 7.252\u202210 20 POT in neutrino mode and 7.531 \u2022 10 20 POT in antineutrino mode. Using the prior values of the oscillation parameters given on Table 1 left, the predicted number of Super-K events is given on Table 1  The systematical uncertainty on the number of events ranges from \u223c 12% (the four CCQE samples) to \u223c 20% (the CC-1\u03c0 + sample where the uncertainty on the particle identification is larger). In order to decrease the systematic uncertainty due to flux and cross-section modelling, a fit of the unoscillated ND280 data is performed. Seven samples are selected in ND280 for this purpose: three samples of \u03bd \u00b5 CCQE, CC-1\u03c0 + and other CC interactions in neutrino mode, two samples of\u03bd \u00b5 CCQE and non-CCQE interactions in antineutrino mode, as well as two samples of \u03bd \u00b5 CCQE and non-CCQE interactions in antineutrino mode to constrain the strong contamination of neutrino events in antineutrino mode visible on Figure 1. After including the ND280 information, the total statistical uncertainties on the numbers of events are reduced by a factor of three for the CCQE samples and are reduced by a factor of two for the CC-1\u03c0 + sample.",

The first is a frequentist method, that consists of first fitting the ND280 data, then propagating the obtained constraints on the flux and cross-section parameters in a covariance matrix used as prior on the fit to the Super-K data. A minimising log-likelihood method is used to estimate the value and confidence intervals of the oscillation parameters, with the Feldman-Cousins method applied on the extraction of \u03b4 CP [3]. The second method relies on Bayesian statistics, performing a simultaneous analysis of the ND280 and Super-K data where the posterior probability density is sampled with a Markov Chain Monte-Carlo method in order to extract credible intervals and best-fit values of the oscillation parameters. In both cases, the likelihood is marginalised over the systematic parameters and the analysis is performed with and without the information of sin 2 \u03b8 13 measured by the reactor experiments [4].",

The selection of the Super-K samples is being revised in order to increase the fiducial volume, that is excluding the volume 2 m from the inner detector wall in the analysis presented  above. Benefiting from a new reconstruction algorithm, this hard cut on the vertex location will be removed in order to observe an expected increase of 20% more events, with a reduction of the background. The cross-section model is also being refined, notably by the addition of parameters controlling the uncertainties on short and long range correlations. The T2K analyses are taking place in the prospect of the T2K-II phase, that plans to increase the total acquired POT to 20 \u2022 10 21 in order to achieve a 3\u03c3 exclusion of \u03b4 CP [5].",
