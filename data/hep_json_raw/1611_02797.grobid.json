However, to date no direct measurement of the decay modes involving a neutron has been performed. It has been argued that isospin symmetry works well in the charmed baryon sector [2]. Comparing BFs of the final states with a neutron to the final states with a proton provides an important 132 observable in testing isospin symmetry in \u039b + c three-body decays [2]. The decay \u039b + c \u2192 nK 0 \u03c0 + is the most favored decay of the \u039b c involving a neutron. Under the isospin symmetry, its amplitude is related to those of the most favored proton modes \u039b + c \u2192 pK \u2212 \u03c0 + and \u039b + c \u2192 pK 0 \u03c0 0 as A(nK 0 \u03c0 + ) + A(pK \u2212 \u03c0 + ) + \u221a 2A(pK 0 \u03c0 0 ) = 0. Hence, precise measurement of the BF for \u039b + c \u2192 nK 0 \u03c0 + provide stringent test on the isospin symmetry in the charmed baryon decays by examining this triangle relation.",

            "text": "Furthermore, study of \u039b + c \u2192 nK 0 \u03c0 + is important to explore the decay mechanism of the \u039b + c , especially the factorization scheme and the involved final state interaction [2,3]. In the three-body \u039b + c decay to NK\u03c0, the total decay amplitudes can be decomposed into two isospin amplitudes of the NK system as isosinglet (I (0) ) and isospin-one (I (1) ). In the factorization limit, the colorallowed tree diagram, in which the \u03c0 + is emitted and the NK is an isosinglet, dominates I (0) , and I (1) is expected to be small compared to I (0) as it can only proceed through the color-suppressed tree diagrams. Though the factorization scheme is spoiled in charmed meson decays, whether this scheme is valid in the charmed baryon \u039b + c decays is of great interest to both theorists and experimentalists and strongly deserves the experimental investigation. The measurement of BF for \u039b + c \u2192 nK 0 \u03c0 + can validate or falsify this scheme. Together with the \u039b + c \u2192 p(K\u03c0) 0 , the \u039b + c \u2192 nK 0 \u03c0 + can be used to determine the magnitudes of the two isospin amplitudes and their phase difference, which provides crucial information on the final state interaction. In addition, hight statistics data will facilitate to understand the resonant structures [4,5]  The BESIII detector is a cylindrical detector with a solid-angle coverage of 93% of 4\u03c0 that operates at the   S \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ,\u039b \u2192p\u03c0 + ,\u03a3 0 \u2192 \u03b3\u039b with\u039b \u2192p\u03c0 + , \u03a3 \u2212 \u2192p\u03c0 0 and \u03c0 0 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3, respectively.",

We measure the absolute branching fraction for \u039b + c \u2192 nK 0 S \u03c0 + , B(\u039b + c \u2192 nK 0 S \u03c0 + ) = (1.82\u00b10.23\u00b10.11)%, where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second is sys-402 tematic. This is the first direct measurement of a \u039b + c decay involving the neutron in the final state since the 404 discovery of the \u039b + c more than 30 years ago. Quoting B(\u039b + c \u2192 pK \u2212 \u03c0 + ) and B(\u039b + c \u2192 pK 0 S \u03c0 0 ) measured by and validate the isospin symmetry [2]. Besides, we obtain B(\u039b + c \u2192 nK 0 \u03c0 + )/B(\u039b + c \u2192 pK \u2212 \u03c0 + ) = 0.62 \u00b1 0.09 and B(\u039b + c \u2192 nK 0 \u03c0 + )/B(\u039b + c \u2192 pK 0 \u03c0 0 )) = 0.97 \u00b1 0.16 [18], in which the common uncertainties have been cancelled in the calculation. According to Ref. [2], based on these ratios, the strong phase difference of I (0) and I (1) is calculated to be cos \u03b4 = \u22120.24 \u00b1 0.08, which is useful to understand the final state interactions in \u039b + c decays. Furthermore, the relative size of the two amplitudes |I (1) |/|I (0) | is evaluated to be 1.14 \u00b1 0.11, which indicates that the amplitude I (1) is not small as expected in the factorization scheme. This is consistent with the behaviors in the charmed meson decays [19]. These results will be essential inputs for the study of other \u039b c decays in theory. Hence, the measurement of the neutron mode in this work provides the first complementary da-424 ta to the previously measured decays involving a proton, which represents significant progress in studying the \u039b + c .",
