            "text": "An important requirement of understanding the structure of the nucleon better is to map out its spectrum of excited states. However, deciphering the data to understand the resonance excitations has been limited by both the data itself and the current state of existing theories. Ideally we should expect the fundamental theory of the strong interaction, quantum chromodynamics (QCD), to provide a prediction for the nucleon excitation spectrum. However, because of the nonperturbative nature of QCD at the relevant energies, this idea has not yet been fully realized. Thus we have looked instead to effective models of QCD, such as constituent quark models, to gain some insight. Present quark model calculations of the nucleon spectrum have predicted more states than have been seen experimentally [1]. This has been termed the \"missing\" resonance problem, and the existence of these states is tied in directly with the underlying degrees of freedom of the nucleon that govern hadronic production at moderate energies [2].",

            "text": "Most of our current understanding of nucleon resonances comes from reactions involving pions in the initial and/or final states. Koniuk and Isgur suggested that the missing states might be revealed in decays to channels where mesons other than pions or multiple pions are in the final state [3]. Indeed, there are indications from theory that some missing states have a similar probability of decaying into channels such as \u03c9N, \u03b7N, \u03c0\u03c0N, and KY (Y = , ) compared to the \u03c0N channel [1,4]. As baryon resonances have large widths and are often overlapping, studies of different final states provide important complementary cross checks in quantitatively understanding the contributing amplitudes.",

            "text": "In this work, we study the electroproduction of strange final states. While electromagnetic production of KY final states has a much lower cross section than hadronic production reactions, the use of an electromagnetic probe has a distinct advantage, namely, that all electromagnetic quantities in the reaction amplitude can be straightforwardly expressed in the context of quantum electrodynamics. Furthermore, in addition to the different coupling constants compared to the \u03c0N channel (e.g., g KNY vs g \u03c0NN ), the study of the exclusive production of KY final states has another advantage in the search for missing resonances. The higher masses of the kaon and hyperons, compared to their nonstrange counterparts, kinematically favor a two-body decay mode for states with masses near 2 GeV. Not only is this situation advantageous from an experimental viewpoint, but this also happens to be the mass region where the majority of the missing resonance states are expected to exist [1].",

However, the present state of understanding is limited by a lack of precision data (Ref. [6] contains a brief review). Model fits to the cross section data are generally obtained at the expense of many free parameters, which makes it difficult to provide precise constraints. Moreover, cross section data alone are not sufficient to fully understand the reaction mechanism, as they represent only a portion of the full amplitude response. In this regard, measurements of spin observables are essential for continued theoretical development in this field. Fits to the limited available data lead to ambiguities and model dependence in interpreting the results. Polarization data can provide for improved constraints on the model parameters, increasing their discriminatory power and allowing for a quantitative measure of whether or not new resonance states are required to explain these and other hyperon production data. One main issue involves discriminating resonant states from the nonresonant background and from effects caused by final-state interactions or channel couplings instead of N * and * contributions [7].",

Data such as these that span both a wide energy and angular range are essential to disentangle the resonant and nonresonant contributions to the KY spectrum [7,11]. This has been demonstrated in several recent amplitudelevel analyses with channel couplings based on photoproduction data [12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19].

[10] were shown to support a description in which the spin properties of the quark-pair creation operator might be responsible for the observed trends in the polarization. This framework indicated that the quarkpair creation operator dominating the reaction produces the ss pair with spins antialigned. This finding, if confirmed, has important implications since many, if not most, calculations of hadron spectroscopy use a 3 P 0 operator to calculate the transition to the final-state particles [25]. In this work, the angular distribution of the transferred polarization is studied with greater precision than in Ref. [10] and compared against two semiclassical partonic models that lead to quite different predictions regarding the K + reaction mechanism and the quark-pair creation dynamics. The first is the model from Ref. [10]. The second assumes the reaction proceeds from an ss quark pair with the quark spins aligned. The main differences between the models are discussed, and a possible experiment to discriminate between them is proposed.",

To arrive at any theoretical expectations for the transferred polarization, effective models must be employed that ultimately represent approximations to QCD. This analysis highlights three different theoretical model approaches. The first is a traditional hadrodynamic model, the second is based on kaon Regge trajectory exchange, and the third is a hybrid Regge plus resonance approach.",

The Born diagrams include the exchange of the proton, kaon, and ground-state hyperons, while the extended Born diagrams include the exchange of the associated excited states. This description of the interaction, which involves only first-order terms, is sensible, as the incident and outgoing electrons interact rather weakly with the hadrons. A complete description of the physics processes requires taking into account all possible channels that could couple to the initial and final states, but the advantages of the tree-level approach are to limit complexity and to identify the dominant trends. The drawback in this class of models is the large number of hadrons that can contribute in the intermediate state of the reaction. Depending on which set of resonances a given model includes, very different conclusions about the strengths of the contributing diagrams may be reached.",

For K + 0 production, the MB model includes the core N * states and the * resonances S 31 (1900) and P 31 (1910). The model also includes K * (892) and K 1 (1270) exchanges for both KY final states, but does not include any u-channel diagrams. The N * states S 11 (1650), P 11 (1710), and P 13 (1720) are the only states listed by the Particle Data Group [5] with coupling strengths to K (see Table I). While the relevance of these core states in the \u03b3 ( * ) p \u2192 K + reaction has long been considered a well-established fact, this set of states falls short of reproducing the experimental results in the region below W = 2.0 GeV. Furthermore, two recent analyses have called the importance of the P 11 (1710) state into question [16,18]. Beyond the core states, the PDG lists a two-star P 13 (1900) state as the sole established N * near 1900 MeV. However, with a 500-MeV width, it appears unlikely that this state by itself can explain the structure(s) visible in the CLAS and SAPHIR cross sections, unless its parameters are significantly different than those given by the PDG. This has led to suggestions of a new (unconfirmed) N * state in this mass region [e.g., the D 13 (1900) state in the MB model]. However, the analysis of Saghai [29], using the same data sets employed for the MB model fits, concluded that by tuning the u-channel background processes involved in the K + reaction, the need to include any states beyond the core set was removed. Note that the investigation of contributing N * states to the KY reactions has typically been limited to spin j < 5/2 because of the expectations that higher spin resonances do not significantly contribute to the reaction dynamics [16,30].",

            "text": "Moving beyond tree-level approaches to consider recent multipole and coupled-channel models has not led to dramatic new insights into the N * spectrum. The multipole analysis by Mart and Sulaksono [31], as well as the coupled-channel models of Julia-Diaz et al. [17] and Sarantsev et al. [18] (which all employ CLAS photoproduction data in their fits), claim that a D 13 (1900) state is required by both the CLAS and SAPHIR \u03b3p \u2192 K + data. However, the coupled-channel model of Ireland et al. [32] points to a P 11 (1840) state as a more likely candidate (although one or more of S 11 , P 11 , P 13 , D 13 are not ruled out). The fits of Julia-Diaz et al. [17] suggests a third S 11 resonance might also be playing a role, while Sarantsev et al. [18] also require [in addition to a D 13 (1900)] the presence of a P 11 (1840) and another D 13 state at 2170 MeV. An extension of the coupled-channel model of Sarantsev et al. [18] by Avisovich et al. [19], which was the first model to include the CLAS photoproduction hyperon polarization transfer observables C x and C z [9], concluded that a P 13 (1900) state was also required to satisfactorily fit the data.",

This calculation includes no baryon resonance terms at all. Instead, it is based only on gauge-invariant t-channel K and K * Regge-trajectory exchange. It therefore provides a complementary basis for studying the underlying dynamics of strangeness production. It is important to note that the Regge approach has far fewer parameters than the hadrodynamic models. These include the K and K * form factors (assumed to be of a monopole form) and the coupling constants g KY N and g K * Y N (taken from photoproduction studies). The GLV model was fit to higher energy photoproduction data where kaon exchanges dominate and extrapolated down to JLab energies. Furthermore, the use of Regge propagators eliminates the need to introduce strong form factors in the background terms, thus avoiding the gauge-invariance issues associated with traditional effective Lagrangian models.",

In the K + 0 channel, the same Regge description significantly underpredicts the differential cross sections and separated structure functions [6,27].

It differs from traditional isobar approaches in its description of the nonresonant diagrams, which involve the exchange of K and K * Regge trajectories. A selection of s-channel resonances are then added to this background. This \"Regge plus resonance\" model (referred to here as RPR) [7] has the advantage that the background diagrams contain only a few parameters that are constrained by high-energy data where the t-channel processes dominate. In addition to the kaonic trajectories, the RPR model includes the s-channel resonances S 11 (1650), P 11 (1710), P 13 (1720), and P 13 (1900) (see Table II). The model also includes either a D 13 (1900) or P 11 (1900) state in the K + channel. In detailed comparisons with the separated structure functions [6,34] and transferred polarization data from CLAS [10], only the D 13 (1900) assumption could be reconciled with the data, whereas the P 11 (1900) option could clearly be rejected [7]. In the K + 0 channel, four * states, D 33 (1700), S 31 (1900), P 31 (1910), and P 31 (1920), have been included (see Table II).",

A totally absorbing Faraday cup, located at the end of the beam line, was used to determine the integrated beam charge passing through the target. The efficiency of detection and reconstruction for stable charged particles in the fiducial regions of CLAS is greater than 95%. The solid angle coverage of CLAS is approximately 3\u03c0 sr. The polar angle coverage for electrons ranges from 8 \u2022 to 45 \u2022 , while for hadrons it is from 8 \u2022 to 142 \u2022 , with an angular resolution of \u03b4\u03b8, \u03b4\u03c6 \u223c 1 of better than 2 mr.

The CLAS event readout was triggered by a coincidence between a Cherenkov counter and a calorimeter detector in a single sector, generating an event rate of \u223c2 kHz. The main CLAS torus had its polarity set such that negatively charged particles were bent toward the electron beam line. The electron beam was longitudinally polarized, with the polarization determined by a coincidence M\u00f8ller polarimeter. Beam polarization measurements were taken at regular intervals throughout the running periods and measured a stable electron beam polarization of 70%. The data in this paper were collected as part of the CLAS running periods e1c in early 1999 and e1-6 in late 2001/early 2002. The e1c running period included data with beam energies of 2.567 GeV (previously published in Ref. [10]) and 4.261 GeV acquired at several different field settings of the main CLAS torus. The 4.261 GeV value represents the luminosity-averaged beam energy for data taken with electron beam energies of 4.056, 4.247, and 4.462 GeV. Combining the data sets is justified given the relatively small spread in the virtual photon polarization parameter among the different energies. The e1-6 running period was taken with an electron beam energy of 5.754 GeV. Information regarding the different run periods, including the total number of triggers, the approximate W and Q 2 ranges of the data, the number of hyperons in the different analyses detected through the e K + p final state, and the average beam polarization, is contained in Table IV.",

To remove negatively charged pions from the electron candidate sample, a cut was placed on the ratio of the measured energy deposited in the fiducial region of the EC (accounting for the sampling fraction of the calorimeter) to the momentum of the particle.

This is expected to be a reasonable approach as the radiative effects are independent of the beam helicity and thus should effectively cancel out of the asymmetry calculation. With our relatively tight hyperon mass cuts, the maximum radiated photon energy is only about 50 MeV, which has a negligible impact on our computed cos \u03b8 RF p values with respect to each quantization axis.",

The contributions to the total systematic uncertainty belong to one of four general categories: polarization extraction, beam-related factors, acceptance function, and background contributions. As the statistics for the K + final state dominate those for the K + 0 final state, the determination of the assigned systematics for both final states is based on an analysis of the K + data. The exception to this is the assignment of a separate systematic for the background contributions. The final systematic uncertainty compilation for the 5.754 GeV measurements is given in Table VI. The procedure used to assign a systematic uncertainty to each source within a given category is to compare the measured polarization P for all kinematic bins with the nominal analysis cuts or procedures (nom) to that with modified cuts or procedures (mod). The spread in the difference of the polarization over all data points, P = P nom \u2212 P mod , is used as a measure of the systematic uncertainty for a given source.

This arises not from the limitations of the 0 data sample (which has roughly 3000 counts in each analysis bin), but rather from the scaling by \u03b1 /\u03b1 in Eq. (26). It should also be made clear that the e1-6 running period at CLAS represented a very lengthy run period (extending over 4 months) that recorded nearly 5 \u00d7 10 9 triggers. Given the effect of the background beneath the 0 peak, CLAS will likely not be able to provide more precise electroproduction data for this observable. Figures 16-18 indicate that the measured 0 transferred polarization tends to have the same sign as the polarization for the different axes. More quantitative statements cannot be made given the statistical quality of the data. In comparing the data with the models, with the possible exception of the MB model (solid black), one sees that they qualitatively match the sign and trends of the data, as was the case for the data. However, as the P observable has not been measured before, the results can still serve to provide at least loose constraints on the theoretical models. Certainly the P data can be used to improve the knowledge of the contributing N * states by allowing for improved descriptions of the associated form factors and the g KN coupling strengths. These improvements can then be used in the 0 modeling, which typically employ the same set of N * states for both the K + and K + 0 final states.",

Therefore, these observables are not independent. They do, however, measure different quantities (as seen in Table III) since they are projections onto different axes. In adding these together to form R sum , the uncertainties from P z and P z were added together.  The results of our fits to the 4.261 and 5.754 GeV data are shown in Fig. 20 (heavy solid lines) along with an error band (light solid lines). The error bands include uncertainties both from the fitting of Eq. (35), and, for the 4.261 GeV data, contributions from uncertainties in the fits of the cross section data. The latter contribution to the uncertainties is about half that of the former. The error band indicates that the extrapolation to x = 1 is well constrained. For the 5.754 GeV data, we display the fit using the calculated cross section for one particular choice of the MB model [26], which allows different choices of the form factors and couplings. Table VII shows the resulting \u03c7 2 \u03bd , the polarization extrapolated to x = 1, and R \u03c3 . Since the 5.754 GeV data required a model for \u03c3 U , we repeated the fit for five different parameter set choices within the framework of the MB model [26]. Thus, the 5.754 GeV results in the table reflect the average values of \u03c7 2 \u03bd , the polarization extrapolated to x = 1, and R \u03c3 for different models. We estimated the model uncertainty by using the standard deviation of R \u03c3 from using the five different models.",

In fact, the polarization is essentially unity if the virtual photon depolarization factor is taken into account (see Sec. IV D). The lack of a strong W and Q 2 dependence indicates that the data might be more economically described in a flux-tube strong-decay framework. There is growing evidence that the relevant degrees of freedom to describe the phenomenology of hadronic decays are constituent quarks bound by a gluonic flux tube [56]. Properties of the flux tube can be determined by studying qq pair production, since this is widely believed to produce the color field neutralization that breaks the flux tube. Since the 1970's, it has been argued that a quark pair with vacuum quantum numbers is responsible for breaking the color flux tube (the 3 P 0 model [57]).",

            "text": "This simple phenomenology of the polarization data has led two groups within the CLAS Collaboration to develop semiclassical models based on partonic degrees of freedom to describe the associated reaction mechanism. In the model of Carman et al. [10,58] shown in Fig. 22(a)], it is assumed that the cross section is dominated by photoabsorption by a u quark. Due to the helicity-conserving vector interaction, the u quark becomes polarized along the photon direction (+z). Hadronization into the K + final state proceeds with the production of an ss pair that breaks the color flux tube. Because the u quark hadronizes as a pseudoscalar K + , thes quark spin is required to be opposite to that of the u quark, i.e., in the \u2212z direction. In the nonrelativistic quark model, the entire spin of the is carried by the s quark. Since the polarization is in the +z direction, seen by the fact that P z > 0, it was concluded that the s ands spins were anti-aligned when they were created, if the hadronization process did not flip or rotate their spins. Note that Liang and Boros also posit a two-step process for the production of transversely polarized hyperons in the exclusive pp \u2192 pK + reaction [59], and come to a similar conclusion that the ss quark pair must have been produced with spins anti-aligned. More recently, polarization has been interpreted within an instanton interaction model [60], which also is assumed to occur with the production of an anti-aligned ss quark pair. A dominance of spin anti-alignment for the s and the reaction where a circularly polarized virtual photon strikes an oppositely polarized u quark inside the proton. The spin of this quark flips, and the quark recoils from its neighbors. An ss quark pair is created from a J \u03c0 = 0 \u2212 two-gluon exchange (in lowest order) to produce the final-state K + and hyperon. (b) A model of the reaction where an ss quark pair is produced from a circularly polarized real photon that hadronizes such that the s quark in the retains its full polarization after being \"precessed\" by a spin-orbit interaction, while thes quark ends up in the spinless kaon. In both pictures, the shaded band represents a spinless u-d diquark system.s quarks would not be consistent with the S = 1 3 P 0 operator [25], which predicts a 2:1 mixture of ss quarks produced with spins aligned vs anti-aligned if the orbital substates are equally populated. Along with other observations of failure of the 3 P 0 model (e.g., explaining \u03c0 2 \u2192 \u03c1\u03c9 decay [25]), the applicability of the 3 P 0 model in describing all hadronic decays is brought into doubt if this model is appropriate.",

Based on these data, Schumacher has introduced a different model [58,61] to explain the polarization results. In this model, shown in Fig. 22(b), the produced ss pair is created in a 3 S 1 configuration (J = 1, S = 1, L = 0, i.e., J \u03c0 = 1 \u2212 ). Here, following the principle of vector meson dominance, the real photon fluctuates into a virtual \u03c6 meson that carries the polarization of the incident photon. Therefore, the quark spins are in the direction of the spin of the photon before the hadronization interaction. The s quark of the pair merges with the unpolarized diquark within the target proton to form the baryon, and thes quark merges with the remnant u quark of the proton to form a spinless K + meson.",

Neither model specifies a detailed dynamical mechanism. If we take the gluonic degrees of freedom into consideration, the model of Carman et al.

To the same order of gluon coupling, the model of Schumacher [61] is the quark-exchange mechanism illustrated in Fig. 22(b), again mediated by a two-gluon exchange.

The increased statistical precision of these new data will enable improved fits either for effective Lagrangian models or for coupled-channel model fits incorporating both photo-and electroproduction data that will be carried out by several groups in the near future [62], including the Excited Baryon Analysis Center (EBAC) [63] at Jefferson Laboratory. The analysis of the full set of the world's data in this manner is essential to mapping out the full spectrum of excited states of the nucleon to better determine the structure of the nucleon and its associated degrees of freedom, both of which are necessary to better understand the strong interaction and QCD.",

While the two models make very different assumptions regarding the reaction mechanism leading to production of the K + final state and different quantum numbers of the produced ss pair, we have provided suggestions for testing them by comparing polarization data for K + to K * + final states. Disentangling the true reaction dynamics in a partonic model is relevant to probe the appropriate quark-pair creation operator that governs the transitions to the final state particles and to shed light on the relevance of quark-gluon dynamics in a domain thought to be dominated by meson/baryon degrees of freedom.",
