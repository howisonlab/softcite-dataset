            "text": "Heavy quarkonia, both cc and bb bound states, have provided good laboratories for the study of the strong interaction [1,2]. For the hadronic transitions between the heavy quarkonium states, Yan [3] characterized it as the emission of two soft gluons from the heavy quarks and the conversion of gluons into light hadrons. Based on this scheme, a series of decay rates, such as the E1-E1 hadronic transition, E1-M1 hadronic transition, M1-M1 hadronic transition have been calculated [4,5]. It has been shown that the multipole expansion can make quite successful predictions for many hadronic transitions between the heavy quarkonia [1,6].",

We note that the theoretical prediction uses experimental results as input to normalize the parameters in the model. For example, the parameter \u03b1 M /\u03b1 E is extracted by comparing the branching fraction of \u03c8(3686) \u2192 h c \u03c0 0 between the theoretical calculation and the experimental measurement. This makes the prediction highly dependent on the former experimental results and theoretical models. This may partly explain the discrepancy between the theoretical prediction and the experimental results. N fit is the number of events from the fits shown in Fig.3, N signal is the number of events after the peaking background subtraction, N up observed is the upper limit on the number of events at the 90% C.L. observed on data, and N up expected is the expected upper limit on the number of events at the 90% C.L. from toy MC experiments.
