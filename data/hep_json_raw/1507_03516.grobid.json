The ground state of the B c meson family has a rich set of decay modes since either constituent quark can decay with the other as a spectator, or they can annihilate to a virtual W boson. The search for new B \u00fe c decay channels 1 and precise measurements of their branching fractions can improve the understanding of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) and can test various effective models. Many properties of the B \u00fe c meson have been investigated by the LHCb experiment: the B \u00fe c mass, lifetime and production rate have been measured [1][2][3][4][5][6], while several new decay channels have been observed [2,3,[7][8][9][10][11][12][13]. The observation of the B \u00fe c \u2192 \u03c8\u00f02S\u00de\u03c0 \u00fe decay was made with pp collision data at a center-of-mass energy of ffiffi ffi s p \u00bc 7 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1.0 fb \u22121 [8].

The detector includes a high-precision tracking system consisting of a silicon-strip vertex detector surrounding the pp interaction region [22], a large-area silicon-strip detector located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4 Tm, and three stations of silicon-strip detectors and straw drift tubes [23] placed downstream of the magnet. The tracking system provides a measurement of momentum, p, of charged particles with a relative uncertainty that varies from 0.5% at low momentum to 1.0% at 200 GeV=c. The minimum distance of a track to a primary vertex (PV), the impact parameter, is measured with a resolution of \u00f015 \u00fe 29=p T \u00de\u03bcm, where p T is the component of the track momentum transverse to the beam, in GeV=c. Different types of charged hadrons are distinguished using information from two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors [24]. Photons, electrons, and hadrons are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter, and a hadronic calorimeter. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers [25]. The online event selection is performed by a trigger [26], which consists of a hardware stage, based on information from the calorimeter and muon systems, followed by a software stage, which applies a full event reconstruction.",

The B \u00fe c signals are generated with a dedicated generator BCVEGPY [30,31] through the dominant hard subprocess gg \u2192 B \u00fe c \u00fe b \u00fec. The fragmentation and hadronization processes are simulated with PYTHIA [32,33]. The detector simulation is based on the GEANT4 package [34,35]. The BDT classifier uses information on the candidate's kinematic properties, decay length, vertex quality, impact parameter, and angle between the particle momentum and the vector from the primary to the secondary vertex. The distributions of the variables that are used in the BDT are similar for B \u00fe c \u2192 J=\u03c8\u03c0 \u00fe and B \u00fe c \u2192 \u03c8\u00f02S\u00de\u03c0 \u00fe decays. The simulated sample of B \u00fe c \u2192 J=\u03c8\u03c0 \u00fe is used as the signal sample for the BDT training. The main background is combinatorial, and is represented by the upper sideband in the B \u00fe c mass spectrum from the B \u00fe c \u2192 J=\u03c8\u03c0 \u00fe data sample, requiring the reconstructed mass to be in the range \u00bd6346; 6444 MeV=c 2 . Since the upper sideband is used for the BDT training, the BDT could overperform in this region and distort the expected combinatorial background in the signal region. To avoid possible bias, two BDT classifiers are trained, denoted as BDT1 and BDT2 in the following. The B \u00fe c \u2192 J=\u03c8\u03c0 \u00fe simulation and data samples are both split into two halves. One half of the simulated data sample and of the B sideband is used to train the BDT1 classifier, and the other half for BDT2. Each BDT classifier is applied to the other half of the B \u00fe c \u2192 J=\u03c8\u03c0 \u00fe data sample, which is not used for its training. The B \u00fe c \u2192 \u03c8\u00f02S\u00de\u03c0 \u00fe data sample is also split into two subsamples, one for each BDT classifier. The threshold value for the BDT response is chosen to maximize the signal significance. Finally, the \u03bc \u00fe \u03bc \u2212 invariant mass window \u00bd3030; 3170 MeV=c 2 is applied to J=\u03c8 candidates, and \u00bd3620; 3760 MeV=c 2 to \u03c8\u00f02S\u00de candidates.",

The background in the B \u00fe c \u2192 \u03c8\u00f02S\u00de\u03c0 \u00fe sample consists of a combinatorial background and a partially reconstructed background. The contribution from B \u00fe c \u2192 \u03c8\u00f02S\u00deK \u00fe is negligible. The signal yields are extracted from unbinned extended maximum likelihood fits to the invariant mass distributions of J=\u03c8\u03c0 \u00fe or \u03c8\u00f02S\u00de\u03c0 \u00fe in the range \u00bd6027; 6527 MeV=c 2 , as shown in Figs. 1 and 2 for 2011 and 2012 data, and are summarized in Tables I and II. To improve the B \u00fe c mass resolution, the masses of J=\u03c8 and \u03c8\u00f02S\u00de candidates are constrained to their known values [27]. For the B \u00fe c \u2192 J=\u03c8\u03c0 \u00fe channel, the signal probability density function is modeled by the sum of two double-sided Crystal Ball functions [36], with the same mean value and tail parameters determined from simulation; the combinatorial background is described with an exponential function; and the partially reconstructed background is modeled with the distribution of the B \u00fe c invariant mass obtained from a simulated B \u00fe c \u2192 J=\u03c8\u03c1 \u00fe sample using a kernel estimation [37]. This last shape is convolved with a Gaussian distribution to take into account a difference in mass resolution between data and simulation. For the B \u00fe c \u2192 J=\u03c8K \u00fe background, the shape of the B \u00fe c mass distribution is modeled by a double-sided Crystal Ball function with parameters determined from simulation. For the B \u00fe c \u2192 \u03c8\u00f02S\u00de\u03c0 \u00fe channel, due to the limited statistics, the signal shape is modeled by a single double-sided Crystal Ball function with the tail parameters determined from simulation; the combinatorial and partially reconstructed backgrounds are described with the same models as used for the B \u00fe c \u2192 J=\u03c8\u03c0 \u00fe channel. The total selection efficiency is the product of the detector geometrical acceptance, the trigger efficiency, the reconstruction and selection efficiency, the PID efficiency, and the BDT classifier efficiency. All efficiencies are determined using simulated samples. To account for any discrepancy between data and simulation, the PID efficiencies are calibrated using a \u03c0 \u00fe sample from D \u00c3 -tagged D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 \u00fe decays. The BDT classifier efficiencies of BDT1 and BDT2 are slightly different. After correcting for the BDT classifier efficiencies the signal yields of the subsamples are consistent within the statistical uncertainties. The BDT classifier efficiency, \u03b5 BDT , and the product of all other efficiencies, \u03b5 \u00c3 , are listed in Tables I and II. Several sources of systematic uncertainty on the R B measurement are studied and are summarized in Table III. To account for the uncertainty due to the signal shape modeling, the data are refitted with an alternative shape. The B \u00fe c invariant mass distributions are modeled by a kernel estimation convolved with a Gaussian function, as determined from simulation. A difference of 0.6% from the nominal result is observed and is taken as a systematic uncertainty.",
