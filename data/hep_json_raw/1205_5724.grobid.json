Due to the higher collision energy at the LHC, the PDF and FF can be probed at lower values of x and z, respectively, than in previous experiments. Such measurements can provide further constraints on these functions, which are crucial for pQCD predictions for LHC energies. Furthermore, while pion production at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) [3] is considered to be dominated by gluon fragmentation only for p T < 5-8 GeV/c [4,5], at LHC energies it should remain dominant for p T < 100 GeV/c [6,7]. Theoretical estimates [6] suggest that the fraction of pions originating from gluon fragmentation remains above 75% in the p T range up to 30 GeV/c. Here, the measurement of the \u03c0 0 production cross section at LHC energies provides constraints on the gluon to pion fragmentation [8] in a new energy regime. In addition, the strange quark content of the \u03b7 meson makes the comparison to pQCD relevant for possible differences of fragmentation functions with and without strange quarks [9]. Furthermore, the precise measurement of \u03c0 0 and \u03b7 \u2729 \u00a9 CERN for the benefit of the ALICE Collaboration. meson spectra over a large p T range is a prerequisite for understanding the decay photon (electron) background for a direct photon (charm and beauty) measurement. Finally, a significant fraction of hadrons at low p T is produced in pp collisions via soft parton interactions, which cannot be well described within the framework of pQCD. In this kinematic region commonly used event generators like PYTHIA [10] or PHOJET [11] have to resort to phenomenological models tuned to available experimental data delivered by lower-energy colliders like SppS, RHIC, and Tevatron [12], to adequately describe hadron production. The large increase in centerof-mass energy at the LHC provides the possibility for a stringent test of the extrapolations based on these models.",

They cover the pseudorapidity ranges 2.8 < \u03b7 < 5.1 and \u22123.7 < \u03b7 < \u22121.7, respectively. The proton-proton collision data used in this analysis were collected by the ALICE experiment in 2010 with the minimum bias trigger MB OR [18]. This trigger required the crossing of two filled bunches and a signal in at least one of the two SPD pixel layers or in one of the VZERO counters. An offline selection based on time and amplitude signals of the VZERO detectors and the SPD was applied to reject beam-induced and noise background [18]. Pileup collision events were identified imposing a criterion based on multiple primary vertices reconstructed with the SPD detector, and removed from the further analysis. The cross sections for the MB OR trigger have been calculated from other measured cross sections at the same energies with appropriate scaling factors. At  [19]. Table 1 shows the values of the cross section obtained at both energies as well as the integrated luminosity of the total data samples used. In the photon conversion analysis, only events with a reconstructed vertex (\u223c90% of the total) are inspected, and those events with a longitudinal distance (i.e. along the beam direction) between the position of the primary vertex and the geometrical Table 1 Cross sections of the reactions (top) and integrated luminosities (bottom) of the measured data samples for the two beam energies.",

For the \u03b3 reconstruction constraints on the reconstructed photon mass and on the opening angle between the reconstructed photon momentum vector and the vector joining the collision vertex and the conversion point were applied. These constraints were implemented as a cut on the \u03c7 2 (\u03b3 ) defined using a reconstruction package for fitting decay particles [22]. The photon measurement contains information on the direction which allows to reduce the contamination from secondary neutral pions. With the conversion method a precise \u03b3 -ray tomograph of the ALICE experiment has been obtained [23].

The background is determined by mixing photon pairs from different events and is normalized to the same event background at the right side of the meson peaks. A residual correlated background is further subtracted using a linear or second order polynomial fit. The invariant mass spectrum after background subtraction, depicted by bullets in Fig. 1, was fitted to obtain the \u03c0 0 and \u03b7 peak parameters (a curve). The number of reconstructed \u03c0 0 s (\u03b7s) is obtained in each p T bin by integrating the background subtracted peak within 3 standard deviations around the mean value of the \u03c0 0 (\u03b7) peak position in the case of PHOS. In the PCM measurement the integration windows were chosen to be asymmetric (m \u03c0 0 \u2212 0.035 GeV/c 2 , m \u03c0 0 + 0.010 GeV/c 2 ) and (m \u03b7 \u2212 0.047 GeV/c 2 , m \u03b7 + 0.023 GeV/c 2 ) to take into account the left side tail of the meson peaks due to bremsstrahlung. For the same reason in the case of PCM the full width at half maximum (FWHM) instead of the Gaussian width of the peak was used. We vary the normalization and integration windows to estimate the related systematic uncertainties. The peak position and width from the two analyses compared to Monte Carlo simulations are shown in Fig. 2 as a function of p T . The deviation of the peak position from the nominal \u03c0 0 mass is explained by a finite energy resolution of the detectors convoluted with the steeply falling p T spectrum of produced \u03c0 0 . A residual non-linearity of the energy response in PHOS is reflected in a small difference of the measured \u03c0 0 peak position from Monte Carlo at p T < 2 GeV/c, which is taken into account in the systematic uncertainty (see Table 2).",

It was estimated by varying the fitting range and the assumption about the shape of the background around the peak. The uncertainty related to the non-linearity of PHOS which dominates at low p T was estimated by introducing different non-linearities into the MC simulations under the condition that the simulated p Tdependence of the \u03c0 0 peak position and peak width is still consistent with data. The uncertainties on the calibration and alignment were estimated in Monte Carlo simulations by varying the calibration parameters and the relative module positions within the expected tolerances. The uncertainty related to the pileup event rejection was evaluated in data by estimating the fraction of unidentified pileup events by extrapolating the distance and the number of contributing tracks of found pileup vertices to zero. The uncertainty of the conversion probability was estimated comparing measurements without magnetic field to the standard measurements with magnetic field. In the measurements with converted photons, the main sources of systematic errors are the knowledge of the material budget (dominant at low p T ), raw yield extraction, PID, the photon \u03c7 2 cut and reconstruction efficiency. The contribution from the raw yield extraction was estimated by changing the normalization range, the integration window, and the combinatorial background evaluation.

The additional uncertainty on the parameter A due to the spectra normalization of +3.2 \u22121.1 % and +7.0 Collaboration at the same energy [27]. The ratio of the data points of the two methods to the combined fit, shown in Fig. 4, illustrates the consistency between the two measurements. We compare our results with Next-to-Leading Order (NLO) pQCD calculations using the PDF CTEQ6M5 and DSS \u03c0 0 [8], BKK \u03c0 0 [29] and AESSS \u03b7 [9] NLO fragmentation functions, see Fig. 3. The data and NLO predictions are compared via a ratio  with the fit to the measured cross section (Fig. 5). In the NLO calculations the factorization, renormalization and fragmentation scales are chosen to have the same value given by \u03bc. The uncertainty in the inelastic pp cross section is represented by the full boxes at unity. At \u221a s = 0.9 TeV the NLO calculations at \u03bc = 1p T describe the measured \u03c0 0 data well, while at \u221a s = 7 TeV the higher scale (\u03bc = 2p T ) and a different set of fragmentation functions are required for a description of the data. However, the latter parameter set does not provide a good description of the low energy data. In any case, the NLO pQCD calculations show a harder slope compared to the measured results. Using the INCNLO program [28], we tested different parton distribution functions (CTEQ5M, CTEQ6M, MRS99) and different fragmentation functions (BKK, KKP, DSS) and found a similar result: pQCD predicts harder slopes, and variation of PDFs and FFs does not change the shape, but results mainly in the variation of the absolute cross section. A similar trend is observed for the \u03b7 meson (a higher scale \u03bc = 2p T is required), although the discrepancy is less significant due to the larger error bars and smaller p T reach.",

This is also the case for the NLO pQCD calculation, where in particular the influence of the PDF is reduced in the ratio. Here, predictions that failed to reproduce the measured \u03c0 0 and \u03b7 cross section are able to reproduce the \u03b7/\u03c0 0 ratio. The measured ratio \u03b7/\u03c0 0 grows with p T and saturates at p T > 3 GeV/c at a value approximately equal to 0.5. The comparison of the ALICE result with the world compilation of the \u03b7/\u03c0 0 ratio in hadronic collisions at \u221a s from 13.8 GeV to 1.8 TeV [33] shows that this ratio is universal and independent on the collision energy. Therefore, this ratio can provide further constraints in theoretical calculations of hadron productions at high energies.",

NLO pQCD calculations cannot provide a consistent description of measured data at both beam energies. State-of-the-art calculations describe the data at 0.9 TeV and 0.2 TeV [32], however this is not the case at 7 TeV, where the calculations overestimate the cross sections and exhibit a different slope compared to the data. Thus, this measurement provides an important input for the tuning of pQCD calculations and represents crucial reference data for the measurement of the nuclear modification factor R AA of the \u03c0 0 production in heavy-ion collisions at the LHC. Furthermore, the NLO predictions for the \u03b7 mesons using the newest fragmentation functions require a value \u03bc = 2p T in order to get closer to the experimental results.",
