The outgoing partons manifest themselves, through quark and gluon soft radiation and hadronization processes, as localized streams of particles, identified as jets. At Born level, dijets are produced with equal transverse momenta p T with respect to the beam axis and back to back in the azimuthal angle (\u00c1' dijet \u00bc j' jet1 \u00c0 ' jet2 j \u00bc ). Soft-gluon emission will decorrelate the two highest p T (leading) jets and cause small deviations from . Larger decorrelations from occur in the case of hard multijet production. Threejet topologies dominate the region of 2=3 < \u00c1' dijet < , whereas angles smaller than 2=3 are populated by four-jet events.",

Such studies are important because an accurate description of multiple-parton radiation is still lacking in perturbative QCD (pQCD). Experiments therefore rely on Monte Carlo (MC) event generators to take these higher-order processes into account in searches for new physics and for a wide variety of precision measurements. The observable chosen to study the radiation effects is the differential dijet cross section in \u00c1' dijet , normalized by the dijet cross section integrated over the entire \u00c1' dijet phase space: \u00f01= dijet \u00de\u00f0d dijet =d\u00c1' dijet \u00de. By normalizing the \u00c1' dijet distributions in this manner, many experimental and theoretical uncertainties are significantly reduced.",

The distributions are sensitive to the jet p T resolution because fluctuations in the jet response can cause low-energy jets to be misidentified as leading jets, and events can migrate between different p T max regions. The finite resolution in azimuthal angle causes event migration between \u00c1' dijet bins, while the resolution in rapidity can move jets in and out of the central rapidity region (jyj < 1:1). The correction factors were determined by using two independent MC samples: PYTHIA 6.422 (PYTHIA6) [10] tune D6T [11], and HERWIG\u00fe\u00fe 2.4.2 [12]. The p T , rapidity, and azimuthal angle of each generated jet were smeared according to the measured resolutions [13]. The ratio of the two dijet azimuthal distributions (the generated distribution and the smeared one) determined the unfolding correction factors for each p T max region, for a given MC sample. The average of the correction factors for each p T max region from the two MC samples was used as the final unfolding correction applied to the data. The unfolding correction factors modify the measured \u00c1' dijet distributions by less than 2% for 5=6 < \u00c1' dijet < .

The resulting uncertainty varies from 8% at \u00c1' dijet $ =2 to 1.5% at \u00c1' dijet $ . The systematic uncertainty from using a parametrized model to simulate the finite jet p T and position resolutions of the detector to determine the unfolding correction factors was estimated to be about 2.5% in all p T max regions.

The product of k ISR and the square of the hard-scattering scale gives the maximum allowed parton virtuality (i.e., the maximum allowed p T ) in the initial-state shower. Previous studies have shown that k ISR is the only parameter in PYTHIA6 that has significant impact on the \u00c1' dijet distributions [27]. The default value of k ISR in PYTHIA6 tune D6T is 2.5, determined from the D0 dijet azimuthal decorrelation results [1]. Figure 4 shows comparisons of the measured \u00c1' dijet distributions to PYTHIA6 distributions with various k ISR values. The effects are more pronounced for smaller \u00c1' dijet angles, where multigluon radiation dominates. Varying k ISR by AE0:5 about its default value yields a change of about 30% on the PYTHIA6 prediction for \u00c1' dijet $ =2, suggesting that our results could be used to tune parameters in the MC event generators that control radiative effects in the initial state. In PYTHIA6 tune D6T, the maximum p T allowed in the final-state radiation parton shower is controlled through the parameter PARP(71). We varied the value of this parameter from 2.5 to 8 (the default value is 4.0) and observed less than $10% changes in the \u00c1' dijet distributions in all p T regions.",
