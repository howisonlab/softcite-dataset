The data were taken at Jefferson Lab using the CLAS detector and a longitudinally polarized 14 NH3 target. The three asymmetries were measured in 165 4-dimensional kinematic bins, covering the widest kinematic range ever explored simultaneously for beam and target-polarization observables in the valence quark region. The kinematic dependences of the obtained asymmetries are discussed and compared to the predictions of models of Generalized Parton Distributions. The measurement of three DVCS spin observables at the same kinematic points allows a quasi-model-independent extraction of the imaginary parts of the H andH Compton Form Factors, which give insight into the electric and axial charge distributions of valence quarks in the proton.",

            "text": "It is well known that the fundamental particles that form hadronic matter are the quarks and the gluons, whose interactions are described by the Lagrangian of Quantum Chromo-Dynamics (QCD). However, exact QCD-based calculations cannot yet be performed to explain the properties of hadrons in terms of their constituents. One has to resort to phenomenological functions to interpret experimental measurements in order to understand how QCD works at the \"long distances\" at play when partons are confined in nucleons. Typical examples of such functions include form factors and parton distributions. Generalized Parton Distributions (GPDs), which unify and extend the information carried by both form factors and parton distributions, are nowadays the object of an intense effort of research, for a more complete understanding of the structure of the nucleon. The GPDs describe the correlations between the longitudinal momentum and the transverse position of the partons inside the nucleon, they give access to the contribution of the orbital momentum of the quarks to the nucleon spin, and they are sensitive to the correlated qq components. The original articles, general reviews on GPDs and details on the formalism can be found in Refs. [1][2][3][4][5][6][7].",

At leading-order QCD and at leading twist, considering only quark-helicity conserving quantities and the quark sector, the DVCS process is described by four GPDs, H,H, E,\u1ebc, which account for the possible combinations of relative orientations of nucleon spin and quark helicity between the initial and final state.

When measuring observables sensitive to the imaginary part of the DVCS amplitude, such as single-spin asymmetries or cross-section differences, the imaginary part of the CFF, mF, can be obtained. However, knowing the CFFs does not define the GPDs uniquely. A model input is necessary to deconvolute their x dependence. The DVCS process is accompanied by the Bethe-Heitler (BH) process, in which the final-state photon is radiated by the incoming or scattered electron and not by the nucleon itself. The BH process, which is not sensitive to the GPDs, is experimentally indistinguishable from DVCS and interferes with it.

A continuous polarized electron beam was delivered by the CEBAF accelerator onto a solid ammonia target, polarized along the beam direction. Frozen beads of paramagnetically doped 14 NH 3 , kept at temperatures of about 1K and in a 5T magnetic field, were dynamically polarized by microwave irradiation [17]. The target was 1.45 cm long and 1.5 cm in diameter. The target system included a 4 He evaporation refrigerator and a superconducting split-coil magnet. The magnet, which provided a uniform polarizing field (\u2206B/B = 10 \u22124 ) and at the same time focused the low-energy M\u00f8ller electrons toward the beam line, was inserted in the center of the CLAS detector [14]. CLAS was a spectrometer, based on a toroidal magnetic field, providing a wide acceptance. The CLAS magnetic field was generated by six superconducting coils arranged around the beamline to produce a field pointing primarily in the azimuthal direction. The particle detection system consisted of drift chambers (DC) to determine the trajectories and the momenta of charged particles curved by the magnetic field, gas\u010cerenkov counters (CC) for electron identification, scintillation counters for measuring time-of-flight (TOF) and electromagnetic calorimeters (EC) to detect showering particles (electrons and photons) and neutrons. The segments were individually instrumented to form six independent magnetic spectrometers with a common target, trigger, and data-acquisition system. An additional detector, the Inner Calorimeter, constructed for a previous DVCS-dedicated experiment [15] to complete the photon acceptance at low polar angles (from 4 o to 15 o ), was placed at the center of CLAS. Figure 3 shows the whole setup, including the polarized target, CLAS and the IC. A totally absorbing Faraday cup (FC), downstream of CLAS, was used to determine the integrated beam charge passing through the target.",

Fiducial cuts were also applied to eliminate the events at the edges of the EC (where the energy of a particle cannot be correctly reconstructed because a large part of the induced electromagnetic shower is lost), and to remove the \"shadow\" of the IC, which limits the CLAS acceptance for charged particles. The effect of these cuts on the distribution of the total energy deposited in the EC divided by the momentum is shown as a function of the momentum in Fig. 4. The comparison of the top and middle plots of Fig. 5 shows the effect of these same cuts on the number of CC photoelectrons. Most of the events in the single-photoelectron peak, which come from either pions or electronic noise in the PMTs, are removed by our particle identification (PID) cuts for electrons. The rest of the background is eliminated by the exclusivity cuts applied afterwards as explained in Section V.3 (Fig. 5, bottom).",

The dilution factor analysis (Section V.5) shows that, thanks to the tight exclusivity cuts adopted, less than 10% of the final DVCS/BH event candidates come from the nitrogen. However, given the low statistics collected in the carbon runs, it is not possible to directly subtract for each kinematic bin and helicity state the nitrogen contribution, calculated on the basis of the 12 C measurement, from the 14 NH events. The raw BSA, without \u03c0 0 subtraction, was extracted from the carbon-target data, applying all of the DVCS/BH selection cuts and integrating, for statistics reasons, over all kinematic variables but \u03c6. The resulting asymmetry was compared to the corresponding observable obtained on the 14 NH 3 target. A Student's t-test was performed, and it was found that the two DVCS/BH BSAs for a free proton and quasi-free proton in carbon are compatible at the 3\u03c3 level. This result points to the fact that given the limits imposed by our statistics, our experiment is not sensitive to possible medium-modification effects for DVCS, going from proton to carbon target. Moreover, our results for the dilution factor show a contamination of events from nitrogen in the ep\u03b3 sample of less than 10%, and this contamination comes from bound protons at quasi free kinematics due to the tight exclusive cuts. All this supports the assumption that the contribution to the final beam-spin asymmetries of the incoherent DVCS on nitrogen does not impact sizeably our result, within the limits of our statistical accuracy.",

The VGG model was run for all kinematic bins to obtain A U T (0), with three different sets of options for systematic studies of the model dependence of the correction. The size of the transverse-target spin asymmetry varies with \u2212t, from a few percent at low \u2212t to up to 30% for the highest \u2212t bins. Also the difference between the results obtained for the three sets of VGG options is more sizeable at high \u2212t, where changes of sign for the \u03c6 distribution are observed. As far as the double-transverse spin asymmetry is concerned, it is higher at low \u2212t, mostly positive, and never greater than 30%.

For this goal, the fact that the three asymmetries have the same denominator has been exploited. In fact, by performing a simultaneaous fit of the 3 asymmetries, the common denominator can be constrained to be the same for the three different observables. Thus BSA, TSA and DSA were fitted, respectively, with three functions that shared a common denominator (1 + \u03b2 cos \u03c6). In the highest \u2212t bin of the third (Q 2 -x B ) bin, \u03b2 was set to zero due to the limited \u03c6 coverage. Figure 17 shows the beam-spin asymmetry as a function of \u03c6 for each slice in the Q 2 -x B space (rows) and for each bin in \u2212t (columns). Each asymmetry is fitted with the function",

The dependence in the other kinematic variables appears less marked, although a slight decrease in the \u2212t slope seems to happen at the highest Q 2 and x B values. This is confirmed by Fig. 18, which  values, the VGG model gets closer to the data, while the GK model is systematically higher. Both models expect a steeper \u2212t slope than the data display. This can be due to the fact that these models are based on Double-Distributions, where the \u2212t dependence is factorized with respect to the (x, \u03be) dependence. The data, instead, seem to point to more complex correlations between the three variables. The GGL model is in good agreement with the data at low \u2212t especially for the first and third Q 2 -x B bin, while it diverges away from the data in the high-x B bins. The discrepancy observed for larger x B values is an indication that using only DIS and form factor data one can only provide a loose constraint on the \u03be dependence of the model. The best fit to the data is provided by the KMM12 model, which however does not cover our whole set of kinematics. For consistency, our beam-spin asymmetries were also compared to those obtained from previous CLAS data [15] (e1-dvcs experiment). For this task, the results for the \u03b1 LU coefficient were used, taking the kinematic bins from the e1-dvcs data that were closest to our own. The comparison is shown in Fig. 18, where the e1-dvcs results are represented by the (green online) triangles. The agreement is good, especially considering the imperfect kinematical overlap.",

In fact, the amplitude of the target-spin asymmetry seems rather constant as a function of all kinematic variables, \u2212t included, apart from the expected systematic drop towards t \u223c t min . Figure 20 shows the t-dependence for each bin in Q 2 -x B of the sin \u03c6 fitting coefficient \u03b1 UL (Eq. (43)), which appears fairly constant, unlike what was observed for the beam-spin asymmetry. As mentioned above, the variable t yields the Fourier conjugate of the impact parameter, describing the transverse position of the partons in the reference frame where the proton goes at the speed of light. Therefore, a steep t slope is equivalent to a rather flat spatial distribution, and vice versa. Equations (17) and (19) point to the proportion-ality between, respectively, TSA and m H and BSA and mH. Thus, the t behavior of the TSA compared to that of the BSA suggests that the axial charge (linked t\u00f5 H) is more concentrated in the center of the proton than the electric charge (linked to H). This fact was already observed in a paper [32] devoted to the extraction of the CFFs mH and m H from the HERMES data. This finding is clearly not predicted by the VGG or GK models, which instead display a similar drop with t for the TSA as what was computed for the BSA. These models approximately reproduce the low-t magnitude of the asymmetry in some kinematics (namely, in Q 2 -x B bins 1 and 3), with a slightly better fit of the data for VGG. GK predicts an increase of the TSA with x B that is not observed in the experiment. By comparing the behavior of these two models for the two single-spin asymmetries, it can be observed how both reach good agreement with the data at high \u2212t for the BSA and a low \u2212t for the TSA. These data can therefore provide strong guidance to correct the t dependence of the parametrizations of both H and H. The GGL model also predicts a drop in \u2212t not confirmed by the data, and moreover it overestimates the magnitude of the asymmetry by at least a factor of 2. The best fit to the data is provided, in the bins where it applies, by the KMM12 model.",

It must be pointed out, however, that in the expansion in sin \u03c6 moments done by the HERMES Collaboration, the contribution of the denominator could mix with the sin n\u03c6 terms, while in our analysis it is treated with its own parameter. In the Belitsky-M\u00fcller-Kirchner formalism, the parts of the DVCS/BH interference term depending on sin 2\u03c6 appear only at twist-three level [9]. Therefore, observing a sizeable sin 2\u03c6 component in the target-spin asymmetry would mean having some sensitivity to twist-three CFFs. A recent paper [33] pointed   to a possible way to access the quarks' orbital angular momentum via the measurement of twist-three GPDs. First of all, the stability of \u03b1 UL was verified by comparing the sin \u03c6 parameter obtained with and without sin 2\u03c6 term in the fitting function. The sin 2\u03c6 term appears to be much smaller, at least in the low-t region, than the sin \u03c6 term, often compatible with zero, with a slight tendency to increase at high \u2212t in some kinematic bins towards negative values. The sin \u03c6 component is always dominant. However, given the limited statistics and the relatively small number of \u03c6 bins, the uncertaintes on the denominator parameter highly affect the extraction of such a potentially small higher-twist sin 2\u03c6 modulation in the numerator, so no reliable sin 2\u03c6-extraction can be achieved with the present fitting procedure.",

In the adopted version of the fitter code,\u1ebc Im is set to zero, as E is assumed to be purely real -it is parametrized in the VGG model by the pion pole (1/(t \u2212 m 2 \u03c0 )). Thus seven out of the eight real and imaginary parts of the CFFs are left as free parameters in the fit. Figure 25 shows H Im (black full squares) andH Im (red full circles), which are obtained from the fit of the present data, as a function of \u2212t for each of our 5 Q 2 -x B bins. These are the two CFFs that appear to be better constrained by the present results. Given that the size of the error bars reflects the sensitivity of the combination of observables to each CFF, it is evident that, as expected, our asymmetries are mostly sensitive to mH. The results for H Im andH Im confirm what had been previously observed in a qualitative way by direct comparison of the t-dependence of our TSAs and BSAs in Section VII.2: the t-slope of mH is much steeper than that of mH, hinting at the fact that the axial charge (linked to mH) might be more \"concentrated\" in the center of the nucleon than the electric charge (linked to mH). This effect seems stronger at the lowest values of x B , while both CFFs tend to flatten out as x B increases.",

The dominance of the leading-order handbag mechanism is supported by the prevalence, especially at low \u2212t, of the sin \u03c6 term over higher sin n\u03c6 components in both single-spin asymmetries. The DSA is found to be mostly dominated by the constant term, which contains both BH and DVCS/BH interference, although in our kinematics the BH contribution is the strongest. These data bring important constraints to GPD parametrizations, especially for H andH. Using one method among the various ones that are currently in development, these data allow us to extract the imaginary parts of theH and H Compton Form Factors and to gain insight, via their relative t slopes, about the spatial distribution of the electric and axial charges in the proton. The extraction of the Compton Form Factors will be further improved once the new CLAS results on DVCS cross sections will become available [38]. Furthermore, the extensive DVCS-devoted program planned at Jefferson Lab for the 12-GeV era will extend our knowledge of the Generalized Parton Distributions of the proton in terms of both kinematical coverage and statistical precision.
