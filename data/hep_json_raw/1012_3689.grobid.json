The ISR luminosity is determined from a study of the leptonic process e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 \u03b3(\u03b3), and the method is tested by the comparison with the next-to-leading order (NLO) QED prediction. The leading-order hadronic contribution to the muon magnetic anomaly calculated using the BABAR \u03c0\u03c0 cross section measured from threshold to 1.8 GeV is (514.1 \u00b1 2.2(stat) \u00b1 3.1(syst)) \u00d7 10 \u221210 .

The two-constraint (2C) 'ISR' fit allows an undetected photon collinear with the collision axis, while the 3C 'FSR' fit is performed only when an additional photon is detected.

Induced kinematical effects have been studied using the NLO PHOKHARA generator [15] at four-vector level with fast simulation. Differences occuring in acceptance yield corrections to the QED test.

The performance and robustness of the unfolding method [16] have been assessed using test models.

Systematic uncertainties are reported in Table 1 for 0.3 < \u221a s \u2032 < 1.2 GeV.

In addition, the absolute \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 cross section has been compared to the NLO QED prediction, the two being in agreement within 1.1%. The e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 (\u03b3) cross section, obtained through the ratio of the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 spectra is rather insensitive to the detailed description of radiation in MC. A strong point of the present analysis, comparing to previous ISR studies, comes from the fact that several uncertainties cancel in this ratio, allowing us to achieve our precision goal: the systematic uncertainty in the central \u03c1 region (0.6 \u2212 0.9 GeV/c 2 ) is only 0.5%.",

The first priority should be to clarify the BABAR/KLOE discrepancy, the most important effect on a \u00b5 being due to the difference on the \u03c1 peak. The origin of the slope in this comparison is also to be understood. The slope was very pronounced when comparing with the 2004 KLOE results, and it is reduced with the 2008 and 2010 data. The same slope is also observed in the comparison of the KLOE and \u03c4 data, while BABAR is in good agreement with the \u03c4 results. Further checks of the KLOE results are possible. Actually, as the method is based on MC simulation for ISR and additional ISR/FSR probabilities, an important cross-check should be provided by the comparison of the \u00b5\u00b5 spectrum with the QED prediction.",
