            "text": "Existence of dark matter indicates the presence of unknown fundamental laws of nature. Ultralight axion-like particles are well-motivated dark matter candidates, emerging naturally from theories of physics at ultrahigh energies. We report the results of a direct search for the electromagnetic interaction of axion-like dark matter in the mass range that spans three decades from 12 peV to 12 neV. The detection scheme is based on a modification of Maxwell's equations in the presence of axion-like dark matter, which mixes with a static magnetic field to produce an oscillating magnetic field. The experiment makes use of toroidal magnets with iron-nickel alloy ferromagnetic powder cores, which enhance the static magnetic field by a factor of 24. Using SQUIDs, we achieve a magnetic sensitivity of 150 aT/ \u221a Hz, at the level of the most sensitive magnetic field measurements demonstrated with any broadband sensor. We recorded 41 hours of data and improved the best limits on the magnitude of the axion-like dark matter electromagnetic coupling constant over part of our mass range, at 20 peV reaching 4.0 \u00d7 10 \u221211 GeV \u22121 (95% confidence level). Our measurements are starting to explore the coupling strengths and masses of axion-like particles where mixing with photons could explain the anomalous transparency of the universe to TeV gamma-rays.",

            "text": "Astronomical evidence, built up over eight decades, indicates that only one-sixth of matter in the universe is made up of fundamental particles whose properties we understand [1,2]. The existence of dark matter constitutes compelling evidence for new fundamental particles and interactions beyond the Standard Model. Since it has only been observed through its gravitational effects, there is a broad range of dark matter candidates. The weakly-interacting massive particle (WIMP) is a candidate that has inspired a large number of ultra-sensitive experiments of increasing complexity and scale, but so far there has been no unambiguous detection, and fundamental backgrounds (neutrino floor) will soon start to limit the sensitivity of direct WIMP searches [2][3][4]. Another well-motivated dark matter candidate is the axion, which also offers a compelling solution to the strong CP problem of quantum chromodynamics [5][6][7][8][9]. The axion and other light pseudoscalar bosons (axion-like particles, ALPs) emerge naturally from theoretical models of physics at high energies, including string theory, grand unified theories, and models with extra dimensions [9,10]. Astrophysical observations have produced a number of stringent limits on ALPs, but also some tantalizing hints for their possible existence [2]. One such hint is the observation that the universe is too transparent to TeV \u03b3-rays. These are emitted from distant active galactic nuclei and should be significantly attenuated, through pair production, by infrared background radiation during their travel to our galaxy [11]. The tension with observed TeV gamma-ray source energy spectra can be explained by photon-ALP mixing inducing gamma-ray conversion into axions, which travel unaffected through interstellar space and convert back into gamma-rays in the Milky Way [12].",

            "text": "Experimental searches for the axion and ALPs rely on one of their interactions with Standard Model particles [9,[13][14][15]. Most experiments to date have focused on the axion-photon interaction, which can mix photons with axions and ALPs in the presence of a strong magnetic field. The conversion rate scales with magnetic field and volume, so experiments employ large magnetic fields and volumes for better sensitivity [16]. This effect has been used to place stringent limits on the coupling of ALPs produced in the laboratory [17], or in the Sun [18]. Several searches for axion dark matter in the \u00b5eV mass range have used the technique of resonant conversion into monochromatic microwave photons inside a high-qualityfactor cavity permeated by a strong magnetic field [19]. The ADMX experiment has achieved a level of sensitivity sufficient to search for dark matter axions with masses between 2.66 and 2.81 \u00b5eV and excluded the QCD axionphoton couplings predicted by plausible models for this mass range [20]. A number of cavity-based axion dark matter searches are in development or already exploring ALP masses up to \u2248 30 \u00b5eV [19,21,22]. In order to search for lower-mass axions and ALPs coupled to photons, it is possible to use lumped-element circuits [23][24][25][26][27]. This concept is based on a modification of Maxwell's equations: in the presence of a large static magnetic field B, axion-like dark matter acts as a source of an oscillating magnetic field whose amplitude is proportional to B [28,29].",

In the presence of a magnetizable medium, the modified inhomogeneous magnetic Maxwell's equation takes the form where H = B/\u00b5 0 \u2212 M is the auxiliary field, M is the magnetization, J f is the macroscopic free electric current density, \u00b5 0 is the permeability of free space, c is the speed of light in vacuum, and g a\u03b3 is the strength of ALP electromagnetic coupling [30]. The axion-like dark matter field a = a 0 sin (\u03c9 a t) oscillates at its Compton frequency \u03bd a = \u03c9 a /(2\u03c0) = m a c 2 /h, where m a is the ALP mass, and h is the Planck constant. The coherence time of this oscillating field is \u2248 10 6 periods, set by the kinetic energy of the virialized axionic dark matter [13,28]. We use SI units for electromagnetic fields and natural units for the ALP field so that g a\u03b3 a 0 is unitless, and the ALP field amplitude a 0 is given by the dark matter energy density: m 2 a a 2 0 /2 = \u03c1 DM = 3.6 \u00d7 10 \u221242 GeV 4 [2,13]. Our experiment, the Search for Halo Axions with Ferromagnetic Toroids (SHAFT), contained two independent detection channels. Each channel consisted of two stacked toroids, each of which could be independently magnetized by injecting a current into a superconducting magnetizing coil wound around the toroid, fig. 1(a). With azimuthal field B 0 inside the magnetized toroid, the second term in the right-hand side of eq. (1) represents an effective current density, J eff = \u03c9 a g a\u03b3 a 0 cos (\u03c9 a t)B 0 /(\u00b5 0 c), sourced by the axion-like dark matter field. This loop of current creates an axial magnetic field B a . The pickup coil, wound around the inner circumference of the toroids, was coupled to a Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID) magnetometer, as shown in fig. 1(b), measuring the magnetic flux \u03a6 a due to B a . The axion-like dark matter detection signature would be an oscillating SQUID output signal, whose amplitude was correlated with toroid magnetization.",

In practice, magnetic materials are non-linear: the permeability drops with applied field H 0 and the magnetization saturates. For our experiment, we chose powdered iron-nickel \"High Flux 125\u00b5\" alloy for its high permeability, high saturation flux density, and electrical insulating properties at liquid helium temperature [30]. We determined the permeability of the toroid material by injecting currents up to 10 A into the magnetizing coil and measuring its inductance. The initial permeability was \u2248 110, dropping with increasing coil current as the material saturated, fig. 2(a). The material displayed no magnetic hysteresis. We used the permeability measurements to calculate magnetic field B 0 inside the toroid at each value of the magnetizing coil current using fig. 2(b). Before recording data sensitive to ALP dark matter, we set the magnetizing coil current to 6 A, at which point B 0 = 1.51 T and the material is close to saturation. At this current, the magnetic field inside an air-core toroid would be 0.063 T (dashed red line in fig. 2(b)). Therefore, we can quantify the enhancement of B 0 due to the magnetic material to be a factor of 24. During ALP-sensitive data collection, we switched each of the magnetizing coils into persistent mode, but still monitored each toroid magnetization by making inductance measurements of separate permeability sensing coils, which had been calibrated in advance [30].",

Measurements with the central calibration loop, which was positioned midway between the upper and the lower toroid pairs, and thus had equal couplings to the two pickup coils, showed that the detector channels were in phase, fig. 3(a).

Afterwards, we magnetized the four toroids with 6 A injected current in (+\u2212, +\u2212) configuration and collected 15 hours of data.

Our analysis assumed the boosted Maxwell-Boltzmann ALP signal lineshape predicted by the astrophysically-motivated stan-dard halo model [20,21,35,36]. The linewidth of an axion-like dark matter signal at frequency \u03bd a is determined by the parameter \u03b2 2 \u03bd a = 3v 2 0 \u03bd a /(2c 2 ) \u2248 10 \u22126 \u03bd a , where v 0 = 220 km/s is the local velocity of motion around the center of the galaxy. Following a simplified version of the data analysis approach used by the ADMX and HAYSTAC collaborations, we rejected narrowband RF interference and broadband spectral baseline by using Savitzky-Golay digital filtering to isolate these spectral features in the frequency domain [20,36]. By injecting simulated axion signals into the data, we determined that these corrections attenuated axion spectral signals by 7%, and the final limits were adjusted accordingly [30].",

We modeled the histogram of PSD values in each bin as the chi-square distribution with 94 degrees of freedom, corresponding to the two quadratures of the Fourier transform averaged over 47 independent data blocks, fig. 4(a). We optimally filtered the data within each frequency bin by convolving with the standard halo model axion lineshape. We modeled the histogram of optimally-filtered data points as the normal distribution (verified by a Lilliefors test), and found its standard deviation \u03c3 by fitting to the Gaussian dependence, fig. 4(b). We set the candidate detection threshold to 3.355\u03c3, equivalent to 95% confidence interval for a 5\u03c3 detection [36], and flagged all points above the threshold as candidates. In the 3 kHz to 3 MHz frequency range, with our analysis parameters, there were 20043605 possible ALP frequency points. Assuming the optimallyfiltered spectra are normally distributed, we would statistically expect 7954 candidate frequencies at which the spectral value is above the 3.355\u03c3 threshold in any given channel. Our analysis procedure produced 16292 candidates in channel A, 35375 candidates in channel B, 27278 candidates in the symmetric combination channel, and 12513 candidates in the antisymmetric combination channel. The extra candidates appeared due to residual electromagnetic interference and lower-frequency vibrational tones that got past our spectral correction procedure.",

Despite the much smaller volume of our apparatus (by a factor of \u2248 300), our results constitute significant improvements on this limit over a broad range of ALP masses in the scenario that the ALP field is the dominant component of dark matter.

Cooling the SQUID magnetic sensors to milli-Kelvin temperature can reduce their noise by a factor of \u2248 10, and it may be possible to achieve even better sensor performance using quantum upconversion [37]. For an optimized search, it is necessary to use a scanned single-pole resonator to couple the ALP-induced magnetic flux to an amplifier operating at, or beyond, the Standard Quantum Limit [38]. The ferromagnetic toroidal core allowed us to achieve a 1.51 T static magnetic field with ampere-level injected current, which enabled the two-channel design, but magnetic material saturation prevented further field increase. New magnetic materials, with higher saturation field, could improve sensitivity further, or a high-field air-core toroidal superconducting magnet could be engineered, needing much higher injected current [16]. The most dramatic sensitivity improvement could be achieved by increasing the toroid volume; the Fe-Ni magnetic alloy used in our experiment is inexpensive and readily available commercially. Scaling the volume up to the benchmark 1 m 3 would improve the sensitivity by another factor of 10 4 .",

These reed switches  were placed inside a G-10 tube, which was filled with Stycast 2850FT epoxy. On the outer surface of the tube, a solenoidal coil was wound using copper magnet wire. By running a 2.5 A current through this coil, we could activate the reed switches, which were normally open.

The histogram is consistent with a chi-square distribution with 94 degrees of freedom (red line). This distribution is expected because the PSD is formed by adding the squares of the real and imaginary parts of the Fourier transform and averaging over 47 data blocks. Therefore, it is a sum of squares of 94 independent normally-distributed random variables[39]. (b) The histogram of data in the \u03bd b = 10.04 kHz bin, optimallyfiltered by convolving with the standard halo model axion-like dark matter signal spectral shape. The red line shows the normal distribution fit, and the dashed vertical line shows the 3.355\u03c3 threshold for flagging candidate frequencies. (c) Limits on the electromagnetic coupling strength of axion-like dark matter in the mass range from 12 peV to 12 neV. The blue shaded region is excluded by our data at 95% confidence level. The horizontal black line shows the limit from the CAST helioscope[18], and the grey line shows the ABRACADARBA limits on axion-like dark matter[27]. The trend of improved sensitivity to ga\u03b3 at lower ALP masses (frequencies) is due to narrowing linewidth of the ALP signal, which scales as \u03b2 2 \u03bda \u2248 10 \u22126 \u03bda in the standard halo model.",

Therefore, once the filtered data were subtracted, only spectral features narrower than 0.1\u03b2 2 \u03bd b remain. After subtraction, the distribution of the PSD values was fitted to a shifted chi-squared distribution. The PSD values were designated as the narrowband RF interference peaks and removed if their magnitude was above the cutoff threshold, set at the chi-squared distribution value of 0.1. This procedure was repeated iteratively, since large narrow peaks can lead to large local spectral baseline distortions, but it normally converged after 1-3 iterations. This correction removed 0.02% of the data points. By injecting simulated axion signals into the data, it was determined that this correction does not affect axion spectral signals. (2) Fit and subtract a broad spectral baseline, which was determined by filtering the data with a Savitzky-Golay filter with the order 4 and the impulse response half-length 47\u03b2 2 \u03bd b .
