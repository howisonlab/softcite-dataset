            "text": "Cosmic muons interact with 12 C present in liquid scintillators creating radioisotopes through muon spallation processes, whose decays are a source of background for both neutrino and anti-neutrino experiments. Their formation by muon capture has already been measured by Double Chooz (DC) [1]. The decays of 9 Li and 8 He are most relevant for anti-neutrinos as they can mimic the signal through their double coincidence consisting initially of the \u03b2 electron kinetic energy along with contributions from secondary particles produced through the decay and then followed by a neutron n-capture. This decay signal, consisting of a prompt and then delayed event gives them the nomenclature of \u03b2-n emitters. Their relatively long lifetimes (257 ms for 9 Li and 172 ms for 8 He) combined with the high muon rates at shallow detector sites means that rejecting them through a total veto applied after each muon would shrink the live time to zero. On the other hand, the difficulty of determining their contribution to the signal makes this cosmogenic background one of the most relevant for the measurement of the neutrino mixing angle \u03b8 13 and any other liquid scintillator based experiments searching for anti-neutrinos, e.g the upcoming JUNO experiment [2].",

            "text": "The Near (ND) and Far (FD) Detectors are protected by distinct overburdens of \u223c 120 m.w.e (metre water equivalent) and \u223c 300 m.w.e, respectively. The profile and depth of the overburdens mean that each detector is subject to different muon fluxes and therefore JHEP11(2018)053 cosmogenic background rates. The goal of this paper is the measurement of the 9 Li and 8 He production yields at the two detector sites (i.e. at different overburdens and therefore different mean muon energies). This begins with the generation of the expected 9 Li and 8 He spectra, described in section 3. Data selection, which ultimately contains a mixture of 9 Li and 8 He events is explained in section 4.1 and estimation of the ND and FD 8 He fractions are shown in section 4.2. The 8 He fraction is used in section 4.3 to estimate the values or upper limits where necessary of the yields, production rates, and cross section of each cosmogenic radioisotope at the ND and FD. As the overburdens of the DC detectors are relatively shallow, especially for the ND which started taking data after the FD, they can be combined with existing measurements by KamLAND [3] and Borexino [4] to evaluate the exponential law [5] describing the production yield as a function of the mean muon energy. This relationship will allow future liquid scintillator experiments searching for IBD signals the capability to estimate their cosmogenic background rates.",

Antineutrino detection is based on the Inverse Beta Decay (IBD) process (\u03bd e + p \u2192 e + + n) in liquid scintillators, where the neutron is predominantly captured on Hydrogen (H) or Gadolinium (Gd) corresponding to released energies of 2.2 MeV and \u223c8 MeV, respectively.

The NT is surrounded by 22.5 m 3 of Gd-free liquid scintillator called the Gamma Catcher (GC). The NT and GC vessels are made of transparent acrylic and together they form the fiducial volume used for the detection of IBDs and the cosmogenic \u03b2-n emitters. Gadolinium has a larger cross section for neutron capture than H, so the majority of neutrons in the IBDs in the NT are captured on Gd, whilst in the GC there is no Gd so all the captures are on H. With its Gdloading, the NT was meant to act as the detection volume for anti-neutrinos, but with novel background reduction techniques [7] the fiducial volume could be widened to include the GC. The liquid scintillator in the NT is composed of ortho-phenylxylylethane (o-PXE)/ndodecane mixed in a volume ratio of 20/80, giving a 12 C density of 4.31 \u00d7 10 28 t \u22121 .

The mean neutron capture time on H and Gd, \u223c 200 \u00b5s and \u223c 30 \u00b5s, respectively, determines the selection of candidates which satisfy a time between prompt and delayed event of 0.5 < \u2206T < 800 \u00b5s and a maximum distance between the two of \u2206R < 1.2 m is also applied. An artificial neural network trained on simulated IBD events, used three variables: i) the time \u2206T and ii) distance \u2206R between prompt and delayed events and iii) the delayed visible energy E d to further reduce backgrounds [7]. These selection criteria identify coincident signals composed mainly of IBD candidates which are used to measure the neutrino mixing angle \u03b8 13 .

It is worth stressing that the cosmogenic  selection at the ND is all the more difficult because the IBD rate is higher there than at the FD. On the other hand, the increase in the muon rate is largely absorbed by the increase in r cos . The scarcity of 9 Li and 8 He events makes them difficult to use to create f cos . Instead, another radioactive isotope 12 B, produced by muons in larger abundance, is utilised. Although the real distribution of cosmogenic radioisotope production relative to the muon is wider for 12 B, position reconstruction and geometric effects of the relatively small detector mean that the observed probability densities are similar. The so-called on-time window, for the identification of 12 B correlated events, is shifted by 1 ms from muons prior to a prompt candidate; this removes cosmic neutrons, whose capture time is much smaller than the lifetime of the \u03b2-n emitters. The distribution of the accidental background is determined using several off-time windows which are shifted by more than 10 s. Subtracting the average of these from the on-time window they provide f cos , normalised to unity they provide f acc .

The latter category is dominated by \u03b2-n events and is determined by subtracting the average number of events in twelve off-time windows from an on-time window, where each window is 700 ms long. The measured rates can be found in table 1. The former category is dominated by IBDs, but includes some accidentals and fast neutrons. A complex analysis to determine \u03b8 13 is implemented which incorporates the aforementioned backgrounds to a fit of E p , from which the \u03b2-n rate is determined as a by-product. These rates can be found in table 1 and were cross-checked by applying a fit to the distribution of time differences between prompt events and previous muons giving 12.32\u00b12.01 day \u22121 and 3.01\u00b10.60 day \u22121 for the ND and FD, respectively.

In the ND case the 9 Li values are calculated for f He = 0% and a 3\u03c3 upper limit is given for the 8 He values. The same values are given for Daya Bay [20,21], KamLAND [3], and Borexino [4] where available and any limits are given at 3\u03c3. The Daya Bay 9 Li yields are calculated under the assumption that the measurements of their \u03b2-n emitters are composed purely of 9 Li. be compared to measurements by KamLAND [3], Borexino [4], and Daya Bay [20,21] as demonstrated in figure 6, where the values have been corrected to represent the carbon density of the DC detectors. The Daya Bay yields are estimated from their \u03b2-n rates at each experimental hall assuming they contain 100% 9 Li. As such, and because not all of the uncertainties and efficiencies are known, they are omitted from the fit for \u03b1. Also included in the figure is a measurement at CERN using the SPS muon beam aimed at a liquid scintillator target, where the combined cross section for 9 Li+ 8 He is shown converted into the yield using equation (4.9) and corrected by a factor of 0.87 \u00b1 0.03 to take into account the energy spectrum of cosmic muons [5]. The measurement displayed by the red marker clearly underestimates the expected yield as defined by the best fit line in figure 6. The production rates for 11 C, 8 Li, 8 B and 6 He predicted by [5] for the Borexino experiment were also lower than subsequent measurements made by Borexino [4]. This could be due to an underestimation of the efficiency correction for radioisotope production at larger distances from the muon beam.",
