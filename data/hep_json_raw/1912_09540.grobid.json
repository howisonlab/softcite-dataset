The Yukawa coupling of the top quark to the Higgs field is close to unity [1], which suggests that the top quark may play a role in electroweak symmetry breaking. The top quark is also the only color-triplet fermion that decays before forming color-singlet bound states. This provides a way to study its fundamental interactions with gauge bosons without the complications caused by hadronization.",

The results of this study are presented in table 1. Samples of simulated pp and pp events at \u221a s = 1.96 TeV and \u221a s = 13 TeV, respectively, are also subdivided into two m tt regions to perform the analysis. Comparing the results in the full samples and in the m tt regions, we conclude that the linear approximation is accurate to within a few percent of measured asymmetries and that it reflects the average asymmetry of each sample. We further note that smaller values of the pp asymmetry at \u221a s = 13 TeV than the pp asymmetry at \u221a s = 1.96 TeV appear to be due to the more copious production of events with energetic extra jets which contribute negatively to the average asymmetry. It is clear that our LHC measurements are not directly comparable with those from the Tevatron experiments.  Table 1. The accuracy of the linear approximation used to define A",

This paper discusses our measurements of A (1) FB ,d t , and\u03bc t in pp collisions at the CERN LHC. The analysis uses theoretical models of the tt cross section as functions of A (1) FB ,d t , and\u03bc t to describe the angular distributions observed in a sample of tt-enriched events collected at the CMS experiment. The analysis is based on final states containing a single lepton (muon or electron) and several jets, usually referred to as lepton+jets events. Our measurement of the A (1) FB of top quarks in initial qq states is the first of its kind at the LHC. Values ofd t and\u03bc t have previously been extracted from tt spin correlations [36], but this is the first measurement that relies on differential distributions in tt events. This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 details the strategies used in extracting parameters of interest from the observed cross section. Section 3 briefly describes the CMS detector and the final-state objects used in the analysis. Section 4 discusses the recorded and simulated events. Section 5 describes the event selection and kinematic reconstruction of the tt events. Section 6 discusses the fitting method and the techniques used to estimate the backgrounds. Section 7 describes the systematic uncertainties associated with the analysis. Section 8 reviews the results of the fits to the data, and section 9 provides a brief summary.",

Because of this similarity, and because the SM asymmetry for qg events is expected to be approximately two orders of magnitude smaller than for qq events [15], the gg and qg subprocesses are combined into a single distribution function in our analysis. The m tt distribution for qq events is somewhat narrower than for the other processes. The c * distribution for qq events is more isotropic than that for the gg and qg processes due to the t-channel pole that dominates their cross sections. Of key importance is that the x F distribution for the qq events has a longer tail that helps to discriminate them and to correctly identify the incident-quark direction. Because the gluon and antiquark parton distribution functions (PDFs) of the proton have a lower average transverse momentum than those of the quark parton, the direction of the tt system p L is correlated with the initial quark direction in qq-initiated events. This provides a reasonable choice for the initial parton direction as the direction of the Collins-Soper frame [41]. The result of taking the longitudinal direction of the tt pair in the lab frame as the quark direction is shown in figure 3: defining N C as the number of correct assignments and N I as the number of incorrect assignments, the dilution factor D = (N C \u2212 N I )/(N C + N I ) becomes large in the qq enriched region of large |x F |. The reduced D in the largest |x F | bins appears to be an artifact of the NNPDF3.0 PDF set [42] used to generate the plot, and it does not affect this analysis as no data events are observed with such large values of |x F |.",

Muons are removed from jets using a key-based algorithm, wherein a muon four-vector is subtracted from that of a reconstructed jet if the muon's PF candidate appears in the list of jet PF candidates, and electrons are removed from jets by subtracting their four-vectors from those of any reconstructed jets within \u2206R equal to the distance parameter of the jet clustering algorithm.",

In this algorithm the constituents of the AK8 jets are reclustered using the Cambridge-Aachen algorithm [53,54]. Application of the SD algorithm improves discrimination between signal events, which contain jets from W boson or top quark decays, and background events, which consist of jets produced via the strong interaction, referred to as \"QCD multijet\" events. This improves the jet mass resolution, reducing the mass of single light quark and gluon jets, and mitigating the effects of pileup [55]. The subjets identified by the algorithm are considered as individual objects themselves and are used in the reconstruction of the decaying top quark pair, as described in section 5.",

The leptonically decaying top quark can yield a muon or electron in one of the three topologies, leading to six mutually exclusive categories: \u00b5+jets and e+jets, each of type-1, type-2, and type-3. Muon (electron) candidates are required to have p T > 50 (80) GeV in the boosted topologies, and p T > 30 GeV in the resolved topology. Only lepton candidates in the range of |\u03b7| < 2.4 are considered, and any electron candidates in the transition region between barrel and endcap calorimeters, corresponding to 1.44 < |\u03b7| < 1.57, are rejected. To suppress misidentified leptons resulting from the products of hadronization, accepted leptons are required to be isolated from nearby hadron activity in the event. Lepton isolation is determined in part with a \"2D selection\" applied as a logical \"or\" of two independent selections. The first is a requirement on the component of the lepton momentum that is transverse to the axis of the nearest AK4 jet, called p rel T , and the second is the distance \u2206R = (\u2206\u03b7) 2 + (\u2206\u03c6) 2 with respect to the nearest AK4 jet. In both cases, the nearest AK4 jet must have p T > 15 GeV and |\u03b7| < 3.0. To be considered isolated in the boosted topologies, a lepton must have p rel T > 30 GeV or \u2206R > 0.4. In the resolved topology, lepton isolation is additionally determined according to the sum of the scalar p T of the neutral and charged hadron PF candidates located within a cone of size \u2206R = 0.4 and 0.3 for muons and electrons, respectively. This sum is required to be less than 15 (6)% of the muon (electron) p T , and only leptons passing both the 2D selection and these PF isolation criteria are considered isolated in the resolved topology. Any event containing more than one isolated lepton is rejected to suppress background from two-lepton tt decays in which JHEP06(2020)146 each top quark decays to leptons. Requirements are also imposed on the p miss T in each event to suppress background from multijet events containing a muon or electron. Events in the boosted muon+jets or electron+jets channels are required to have p miss T > 50 or 100 GeV, respectively, and resolved events of both lepton flavors are required to have p miss T > 40 GeV. Events failing p miss T requirements or lepton isolation requirements are used in the estimation of QCD multijet background contribution from data, as described in section 6.",

These identified top quark (t-tagged) jets are selected using simultaneous criteria on jet p T ; the jet mass after application of the SD algorithm; and the ungroomed Nsubjettiness [74] substructure discriminant variable \u03c4 32 = \u03c4 3 /\u03c4 2 , for which smaller values indicate a greater likelihood that the jet is composed of three rather than two subjets. An AK8 jet is considered t-tagged if it has p T > 400 GeV, an SD mass in the range 105 < m SD AK8 < 220 GeV, and \u03c4 32 < 0.81. By contrast, type-2 events are required to have no t-tagged AK8 jets, but must contain at least one AK8 jet with m SD AK8 > 40 GeV, and at least four AK4 jets. Type-1 and -2 muon (electron) events require the highest momentum AK4 jet to have p T > 150 (250) GeV and the second-highest momentum AK4 jet to have p T > 50 (70) GeV. Type-3 events are required to contain zero selected AK8 jets, and at least four selected AK4 jets.",

Comparisons of the statistic observed for each fit to data with those observed in fits to samples of pseudo-data yield p-values that quantify the fraction of pseudo-experiments with poorer fits. The p-values for the fits extracting A (1) FB ,d t , and \u00b5 t are 0.206, 0.233, and 0.274, respectively, suggesting that the fitting models reasonably describe the observed data.",
