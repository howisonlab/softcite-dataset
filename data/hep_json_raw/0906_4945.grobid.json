In the present analysis [1, 2], we combine in a global fit the new H1 measurements [3] with earlier measurements of the H1 [4], Omega [5] and the ZEUS collaborations [6,7,8] in order to achieve the best possible accuracy for the determination of the Pomeron trajectory. By including data from other experiments, we can improve the accuracy compared to a fit to the H1 data alone, which was performed earlier [3]. Such a combination was first performed by the ZEUS collaboration [8].",
