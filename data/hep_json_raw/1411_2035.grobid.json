Using the D \u2212 s \u2192 \u03c6\u03c0 \u2212 , K * (892) 0 K \u2212 and K 0 S K \u2212 decay modes for the Ds reconstruction, we measure the following branching fractions: B(B 0 \u2192 D \u2212 s K 0 S \u03c0 + ) = [0.47 \u00b1 0.06(stat) \u00b1 0.05(syst)] \u00d7 10 \u22124 and B(B + \u2192 D \u2212 s K + K + ) = [0.93 \u00b1 0.22(stat) \u00b1 0.10(syst)] \u00d7 10 \u22125 . We find the ratio of the branching fraction of B + \u2192 D \u2212 s K + K + to that of the analogous Cabibbo-favored B + \u2192 D \u2212 s K + \u03c0 + decay to be RB = 0.054 \u00b1 0.013(stat) \u00b1 0.006(syst), which is consistent with the na\u00efve factorization model. We also observe a deviation of the DsK invariant mass distribution from the three-body phase-space model for both studied decays. The dominant process for the decays B 0 \u2192 D \u2212 s K 0 S \u03c0 + and B + \u2192 D \u2212 s K + K + [1] is mediated by the b \u2192 c quark transition with subsequent W fragmentation to a charged pion or kaon and includes the production of an additional ss pair, as shown in Fig. 1. As the process B + \u2192 D \u2212 s K + K + is Cabibbo-suppressed due to the formation of a us pair from the W vertex ( Fig. 1a), its branching fraction can be compared to the measured branching fraction of the Cabibbo-favored B + \u2192 D \u2212 s K + \u03c0 + decay [2,3].",

A similar significant effect has already been observed in other hadronic [2,3] and semileptonic [7] decays. This phenomenon may be related to strong interaction effects in thecssq (q = d, u) system and, in particular, could be explained by the production of charm resonances with masses below the D    to the PDF, which includes a peaking background in the M bc and M Ds variables. For B + \u2192 D \u2212 s K + K + , we compare the nominal branching fraction with the one obtained from the fit with the B + \u2192 D * \u2212 s K + \u03c0 + component ignored in the PDF. To evaluate the contribution related to the signal shape (c), we repeat the fits while varying the fixed shape parameters by \u00b11\u03c3. The uncertainty due to limited MC statistics (d) is dominated by the statistical error on the selection efficiency. It is evaluated by varying the \u01eb(M (D s K)) values within their statistical errors in the efficiency distributions over M (D s K 0 S ) and M (D s K) and comparing the modified branching fractions with the nominal values. This uncertainty also includes a small contribution from the possible fit bias, which is evaluated by comparing the number of MC signal events with the corresponding value obtained from the fit. Contribution (e) is due to uncertainties in the branching fractions for the decays of intermediate particles, predominantly those of the D s [11]. Items (f),(g),(h) refer to the track reconstruction and particle identification uncertainties, which are related to the detector performance and include potential discrepancies between data and simulations. Finally, the contribution (i) reflects the limited precision on determination of the number of BB pairs in the data sample. The overall systematic error is obtained by summing all contributions in quadrature.",
