The measurements are made using the CMS detector in the pseudorapidity range 3.15 < |\u03b7| < 4.9, for both minimum-bias events and events with at least two high-momentum jets. The data are compared to various pp Monte Carlo event generators whose theoretical models and input parameter values are sensitive to the energy-flow measurements. Inclusion of multipleparton interactions in the Monte Carlo event generators is found to improve the description of the energy-flow measurements.",

            "text": "Proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) allow Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) processes to be investigated through the measurement of the average energy per event (energy flow) in specific angular regions. Such a measurement is useful in examining the complex final states that result from a hadron-hadron interaction. Exploiting the large calorimeter coverage of the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector allows the energy flow to be measured over a wider range than was accessible in previous analyses. At the LHC, the accessible fraction x of the proton momentum carried by partons can become very small. At small x, parton densities become large, leading to an increased probability for more than one partonic interaction. The final state resulting from a protonproton interaction can be described as the superposition of several contributions: the hard interaction, initial-state and final-state radiation, hadrons produced in additional multipleparton interactions [1][2][3][4], and beam-beam remnants resulting from the hadronisation of the partons that did not participate in the hard scatter. The underlying event (UE) is defined as everything except the hard interaction, i.e., multiple-parton interactions, beam-beam remnants, and initial-state and final-state radiation. The UE plays an especially important role at high centre-of-mass energy.",

Phenomenological approaches to multi-parton JHEP11 (2011)148dynamics rely strongly on parameterised models and tuned parameters (tunes) to describe data. Measurements of the UE structure have been performed for central values of the pseudorapidity (\u03b7), where \u03b7 = \u2212 ln [tan (\u03b8/2)], with \u03b8 being the polar angle of the particles with respect to the beam axis [6][7][8]. The energy flow has been measured previously in pp collisions [9] at \u221a s = 0.2 \u2212 0.9 TeV, as well as in ep collisions [10]. The extension of the measurements to large pseudorapidities and higher centre-of-mass energies is a challenge for the models since, in this region of phase space, parton showers (initial-state radiation), as well as multiple-parton interactions, are expected to play a significant role.",

Particle flow objects [20] that combine information from all the CMS sub-detectors were used as input. The reconstructed jets required only small additional energy corrections derived from the pythia6 MC generator and in-situ measurements with photon+jet and dijet events [21]. The contribution of miss-reconstructed jets was kept at a negligible level by means of the procedures discussed in refs. [22,23]. The dijet event sample used in the analysis was a subset of the minimum-bias sample. For the event selection, the two highest-p T jets were required to satisfy the condition |\u2206\u03c6(jet 1 , jet 2 ) \u2212 \u03c0| < 1.0, where \u2206\u03c6(jet 1 , jet 2 ) is the difference in the azimuthal angles of the two jets, and to lie within the central region (|\u03b7| < 2.5). At \u221a s = 0.9 TeV ( \u221a s = 7 TeV), the leading and sub-leading jets were both required to have p T,jet > 8 GeV (p T,jet > 20 GeV). The requirement on \u03b7 ensures that the jets are contained in the central region of CMS, outside the acceptance of the HF calorimeters. The requirement on the minimum transverse momentum of the jets was chosen to reconstruct the jets fully efficiently. The threshold choices result in an approximately similar lower limit on the fractional momentum carried by the jets, at both energies. The dijet selection criteria resulted in 1.1 \u00d7 10 4 (1.2 \u00d7 10 4 ) events in the \u221a s = 0.9 TeV ( \u221a s = 7 TeV) sample.",

Several tunes of the JHEP11 (2011)148pythia6 (version 6.420) [24] event generator were used, each one providing a different description of the non diffractive component: D6T [25], DW [25], Pro-Q20 [26], Pro-pT0 [26], Z2, as well as the central Perugia 2011 tune (P11) [27] and the ATLAS minimum-bias tune 1 (AMBT1) [28]. The tunes differ in the choice of flavour, fragmentation, and UE parameters. The latter set of parameters, which are expected to be important for these measurements, includes parameters for the parton showers, cut-off values for the multiple-parton interactions, parameters determining the geometrical overlap between the incoming protons, and probabilities for colour reconnection. Some of the tunes have common flavour and fragmentation parameters, which have been determined using data from LEP. With the exception of the parameter settings in Z2, P11, and AMBT1, which are based on measurements from the LHC, the other pythia6 UE tunes were determined using data from the Tevatron. Tune Z2 is almost identical to tune Z1 [29], only differing in the choice of parton distribution functions. An overview of the tunes can be found in ref. [27].",

The increase in energy flow for minimum-bias events is larger than what is observed in the charged-particle multiplicity, dN ch /d\u03b7, reported in ref. [59]. Finally, the average energy flow is significantly higher in dijet events than in the minimum-bias sample.",

The tunes giving the limits of the bands are different for each bin. Also shown are the predictions of pythia8, herwig++,dipsy, and pythia6 D6T without multiple-parton interactions. The prediction from pythia without multiple-parton interactions is at least 40% lower than the measurement. We checked that the same prediction at the parton level (without hadronisation) gives smaller energy flow, by approximately 20%. We also found that changing the maximum value for the scale used in the parton shower by a factor of four increases the energy flow only by \u223c5%. Therefore, these effects cannot bring the prediction without multiple-parton interactions into agreement with the data. The herwig++ tunes describe the measurements well at both centre-of-mass energies. The pythia8 predictions are always within the tune uncertainty band of pythia6 and give a slightly flatter energy flow distribution than the data. dipsy, without prior tuning, describes the minimum-bias data well for \u221a s = 7 TeV. However, it overestimates the energy flow for \u221a s = 0.9 TeV, by up to 50%. In figure 3 the measured energy flow is compared to predictions derived from the event generators epos, qgsjetII, qgsjet01, and sibyll, which are used in cosmic-ray air shower simulations.

This decrease of transverse energy is consistent with calculations using a p T -ordered or virtuality-ordered (Q 2 -ordered) parton evolution, with the highest transverse parton momentum being closest to the hard scatter (at small |\u03b7|), and decreasing towards the direction of the proton (large |\u03b7|). The general behaviour of the energy, as well as the transverse energy flow, is well described by MC models applying a p T -or virtuality-ordered parton shower with multiple-parton interactions.  The average transverse energy measured in dijet events can also be compared to the transverse energy in deep-inelastic scattering (DIS) events measured at HERA [10] at a similar x and Q 2 . We compare our measurement of the transverse energy of dE T /d\u03b7 \u2248 4 GeV at |\u03b7| = 3.3 and \u221a s = 0.9 TeV (at a scale of Q 2 = 4p 2 T \u2248 250 GeV 2 and x \u223c 0.02) with the corresponding value from DIS of dE T /d\u03b7 \u2248 2 GeV at x \u223c 0.01 and Q 2 \u223c 250 GeV 2 . For the measurement at 7 TeV, at a scale of Q 2 = 4p 2 T = 1600 GeV 2 and x \u223c 0.006, no corresponding measurements from DIS exist.

By requiring a high-momentum dijet in the central region, the deposited energy increases in the entire phase space. Thus the forward energy flow is higher in the dijet data sample than in the minimum-bias sample. The increase of the energy flow with increasing centre-of-mass energy is reproduced in general by all the Monte Carlo event generators, both for minimum-bias and dijet events. The results indicate that predictions of models including multiple-parton interactions are close to the data. The Monte Carlo predictions without multiple-parton interactions, derived from pythia6 and cascade, significantly  underestimate the energy flow compared to data. None of the pythia6 tunes under study can describe all four energy-flow measurements equally well and, in general, they predict a flatter energy-flow distribution in minimum-bias events. We observe that the D6T and Pro-Q20 tunes provide the best description of the minimum-bias and dijet data, respectively. The predictions from the herwig++ tunes as well as dipsy are also in agreement with the data. The predictions from cosmic-ray interaction models provide the best descriptions of the measured energy flow. The variation of the energy flow with \u03b7, both in minimum-bias and dijet events, is reasonably well reproduced by all Monte Carlo event generators with multiple-parton interactions included. However, the magnitude of the average energy strongly depends on the parameter settings of the different MC tunes, as shown by the large spread in the theoretical predictions.",
