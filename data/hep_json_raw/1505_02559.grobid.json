            "text": "The X(3872) resonance was observed in 2003 by Belle [1] in the decay channel \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J /\u03c8 . The existence of this state was later confirmed by several other experiments [2][3][4][5][6]. The observation of the decay channel X(3872) \u2192 \u03b3 J /\u03c8 implies that the state has even C-parity [5,7,8]. The quantum numbers were finally determined to be J PC = 1 ++ [5,9]. However, the intrinsic nature of the resonance is still unknown and has led to many conjectures. It is a good candidate for a tetraquark state but also for a meson molecule as its mass is close to the D 0D * 0 threshold [10]. The recent observation of the decay Y (4260) \u2192 \u03b3 X(3872) by BESIII [6] implies that the X(3872) could be a meson molecule, as suggested by a model dependent calculation [11]. On the other hand, the large decay rate of X(3872) \u2192 \u03b3 \u03c8(3686) observed by BaBar and LHCb, compared to X(3872) \u2192 \u03b3 J /\u03c8 hints at a tetraquark state explanation [8,12,13]. One of the interesting quantities, which may help to reveal the structure of the X(3872) is its electronic width ee . A recent order-of-magnitude calculation using a Vector Meson Dominance model predicts X(3872) ee \u2248 0.03 eV [14], without any prior assumption regarding the nature of the X(3872). For comparison, calculations for the ee of the ordinary 1 ++ charmonium state \u03c7 c1 have been carried out [15] and the electronic width is found to be in the range between 0.044 eV and 0.46 eV. This was also confirmed in a more recent calculation [14]. is at the O(10 2 ) eV level [16], which is three orders of magnitude larger than the theoretical prediction. The aim of this work is to obtain a significantly improved experimental value for the electronic width of X(3872) that may be contrasted with predictions of ee within various theoretical models making different assumptions regarding the nature of the X(3872).",

In order to search for a possible signal we analyze data taken by the BESIII detector at center-of-mass (c.m.) energies above 3.872 GeV, using the Initial State Radiation (ISR) technique. The ISR photon reduces the available c.m. energy, such that the X(3872) can be produced resonantly via the two-photon process. In the process e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b3 ISR X(3872) we search for the X(3872) in its decay to \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J /\u03c8 with J /\u03c8 \u2192 + \u2212 ( = \u03bc and e).

A detailed description of the facilities is given in Ref. [18]. BESIII consists of four main components: (a) The helium-based 43 layer main drift chamber (MDC) provides an average single-hit resolution of 135 \u03bcm, and a momentum resolution of 0.5% for chargedparticle at 1 GeV/c in a 1 T magnetic field. (b) The electromagnetic calorimeter (EMC) consists of 6240 CsI(Tl) crystals, arrayed in a cylindrical structure (barrel) and two endcaps. The energy resolution for 1.0 GeV photons is 2.5% (5%) in the barrel (endcaps), while the position resolution is 6 mm (9 mm) in the barrel (endcaps). A GEANT4 [19,20] based detector simulation package is used to model the detector response. This analysis is based on four data samples taken at c.m. energies of 4.009 GeV, 4.230 GeV, 4.260 GeV and 4.360 GeV by the BESIII detector. The integrated luminosity of each data sample is listed in Table 1. The total integrated luminosity is L tot = 2.94 fb \u22121 . We simulate the e + e \u2212 \u2192 X(3872)\u03b3 ISR signal process using evtgen [21,22], which invokes the vectorisr generator model [23] for the ISR process and the common \u03c1 J /\u03c8 model for the decay X(3872) \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J /\u03c8 . The Monte Carlo (MC) simulation of the e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b3 ISR \u03c8(3686) process was performed using the phokhara generator [25]. For the background study we simulate the e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b7 J /\u03c8 process with evtgen and the e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b3 ISR \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 process with phokhara.",

The point of closest approach to the e + e \u2212 interaction point is required to be within \u00b110 cm in the beam direction and 1 cm in the plane perpendicular to the beam direction. As the J /\u03c8 resonance carries most of the total momentum, the final state leptons can be distinguished from pions by their momenta in the lab frame. Tracks with momentum p > 1 GeV/c in the lab frame are identified as leptons, whereas tracks with p < 600 MeV/c are identified as pions. The particle identification for leptons is achieved by measuring the ratio of the energy deposited in the EMC divided by the track's momentum measured in the MDC (E/p). If E/p > 0.4, we assume the lepton to be an electron, otherwise it is considered a muon candidate. The E/p distributions of data and MC agree well, and MC studies show that the background for J /\u03c8 \u2192 e + e \u2212 is negligible. The resolution of the invariant mass of the lepton pairs is 16 MeV/c 2 . We require their invariant mass M( + \u2212 ) to be within 3.05 \u2264 M( + \u2212 ) \u2264 3.14 GeV/c 2 for the J /\u03c8 signal selection. Furthermore the opening angle between the two pion tracks is required to satisfy cos \u03b1 \u03c0\u03c0 \u2264 0.6 to remove background from e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b7 J /\u03c8 as well as background from mis-identified electrons which originate from \u03b3 -conversion. Due to the boost of the \u03b7 meson in the laboratory frame, the opening angles of its decay products are small. The reaction e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03b3 X(3872) recently observed by BESIII [6], where the photon comes from a radiative transition of the Y (4260), represents an irreducible background to our signal process. To avoid this background, the ISR photon is required to be emitted at small polar angles | cos \u03b8 ISR | > 0.95, almost colinear to the beam direction. The photon polar angle distribution of the E1 transition Y (4260) \u2192 \u03b3 X(3872) measured in [6] proves that this background contribution can be neglected in this polar angle range. Since the ISR photon cannot be detected in this region of the detector, its energy and polar angle are calculated from the missing momentum of the event (untagged ISR photon). As the photon from the radiative decay channel is predominantly emitted at large polar angles, an optimal signal to background ratio is obtained in this way. An MC simulation study shows that the Y (4260) \u2192 \u03b3 X(3872) background can be neglected in the region of small polar angles of the ISR photon. To improve the resolution of the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J /\u03c8 mass spectrum and to further remove background, a two-constraint (2C) kinematic fit under the hypothesis of the \u03b3 ISR \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 + \u2212 final state is performed. The two constraints are the J /\u03c8 mass for the lepton pair and the mass of the missing ISR photon, which is zero. We accept events with \u03c7 2 2C < 15.",

To estimate the systematic uncertainty due to the width assumed for X(3872), we change the width by \u00b10.2 MeV/c 2 and repeat the entire fitting procedure. The maximal relative difference of these results from the result obtained with the standard width is found to be 2.7% in the luminosity-weighted average. The detection efficiency of ISR X(3872) events was determined from an MC simulation using the vectorisr model [23], since this final state is not available in the phokhara event generator. On the other hand, the ISR \u03c8(3686) detection efficiency was determined using the phokhara event generator, which simulates ISR events with 0.5% precision [24]. To obtain the uncertainty of the ISR simulation with the vectorisr model, we compare the efficiencies of ISR \u03c8(3686) events generated with the phokhara event generator [25] and the vectorisr module [23]. The luminosity-weighted average difference is found to be 3.4% between them, which is taken as systematic uncertainty for the vectorisr model. For \u03c8(3686) ee a further systematic uncertainty occurs due to the choice of the fit function. In order to deal with this uncertainty, we determine the number of N MC \u03c8(3686) using a second fit function, which is a double Gaussian for the \u03c8(3686) peak plus a Gaussian  Table 2. Assuming the sources to be independent, the total systematic uncertainty for the electronic width of X(3872) is 6.1%, while in the case of \u03c8(3686) we find a systematic uncertainty of 4.5%.",

By combining all four data sets, we finally obtain which is the level predicted for ordinary charmonium states [15]. However, our upper limit is still larger than a theoretical calculation [14] which predicts ee 0.03 eV. The results should encourage theorists to compute the electronic width of X(3872) under different assumptions regarding its intrinsic nature and to confront these calculations with our measurement.
