The analysis is done by first estimating the acceptances and efficiencies, then creating a multivariate discriminant for background rejection. This discriminant is optimized a priori with Pythia signal MC and data mass sideband events and validated with the B + \u2192 J/\u03c8K + normalization mode. Before the discriminant is applied the events are required to pass baseline cuts that consist of loose requirements on muon ID, vertexing related variables, muon p T , and di-muon p T . The background is then estimated, which has two sources: combinatorial background and peaking background (B\u2192 h + h \u2212 ). Finally, when the background is well understood the di-muon mass signal region is unblinded.",
