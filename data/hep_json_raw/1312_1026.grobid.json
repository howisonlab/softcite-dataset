The analysis is performed using a 980 fb \u22121 data sample collected with the Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric-energy e \u00fe e \u2212 collider. We search for doubly charmed baryons \u039e \u00fe\u00f0\u00fe\u00de cc with the \u039b \u00fe c K \u2212 \u03c0 \u00fe \u00f0\u03c0 \u00fe \u00de and \u039e 0 c \u03c0 \u00fe \u00f0\u03c0 \u00fe \u00de final states. No significant signal is observed. We also search for two excited charmed strange baryons, \u039e c \u00f03055\u00de \u00fe and \u039e c \u00f03123\u00de \u00fe with the \u03a3 \u00fe\u00fe c \u00f02455\u00deK \u2212 and \u03a3 \u00fe\u00fe c \u00f02520\u00deK \u2212 final states. The \u039e c \u00f03055\u00de \u00fe signal is observed with a significance of 6.6 standard deviations including systematic uncertainty, while no signature of the \u039e c \u00f03123\u00de \u00fe is seen. We also study properties of the \u039e c \u00f02645\u00de \u00fe and measure a width of 2.6 AE 0.2\u00f0stat\u00de AE 0.4\u00f0syst\u00de MeV=c 2 , which is the first significant determination.",

            "text": "However, there are no experimentally established doubly charmed baryons. The lightest doubly charmed baryon contains two charm quarks and one up or down quark (\u039e \u00fe cc \u00bc ccd, \u039e \u00fe\u00fe cc \u00bc ccu), and the spin-parity of the ground state is expected to be 1 2 \u00fe . The mass of the \u039e cc has been extensively studied theoretically, and the prediction of the quark model ranges from 3.48 GeV=c 2 to 3.74 GeV=c 2 [10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20][21][22], whereas the mass predicted by lattice QCD ranges from 3.51 GeV=c 2 to 3.67 GeV=c 2 [23][24][25][26][27]. The cross sections of the \u039e cc production in the process e \u00fe e \u2212 \u2192 \u039e cc X at ffiffi ffi s p \u00bc 10.58 GeV, where X denotes the remaining particles produced in the fragmentation, is predicted to be 70 fb in Ref. [28] and 230 fb in Ref. [29]. The cross section of the pair production of the cc andcc diquarks is predicted to be 7 fb [30]. There have been several experimental studies to search for the \u039e cc . The SELEX collaboration reported evidence for the \u039e \u00fe cc in the \u039b \u00fe c K \u2212 \u03c0 \u00fe [31] and pD \u00fe K \u2212 [32] final states with a mass of about 3.52 GeV=c 2 using a 600 GeV=c charged hyperon beam. However, the results have not been supported by FOCUS [33], BABAR [34], Belle [2] nor LHCb [35]. The BABAR collaboration searched for the \u039e \u00fe\u00f0\u00fe\u00de cc in the \u039b \u00fe c K \u2212 \u03c0 \u00fe \u00f0\u03c0 \u00fe \u00de and \u039e 0 c \u03c0 \u00fe \u00f0\u03c0 \u00fe \u00de decay modes with a 232 fb \u22121 data sample of e \u00fe e \u2212 collisions at or near the \u03a5\u00f04S\u00de. They found no evidence for the \u039e \u00fe\u00f0\u00fe\u00de cc and set an upper limit on the product of the production cross section and branching fractions of \u039e cc and \u039b \u00fe c or \u039e 0 c to be a few fb, depending on the decay mode. In our search for the \u039e \u00fe cc in the \u039b \u00fe c K \u2212 \u03c0 \u00fe final state with a 462 fb \u22121 data sample of Belle at or near the \u03a5\u00f04S\u00de [2], Belle also found no evidence for the \u039e \u00fe cc and set an upper limit on \u03c3\u00f0e \u00fe e \u2212 \u2192 \u039e \u00fe cc X\u00de \u00d7 B\u00f0\u039e \u00fe cc \u2192 \u039b \u00fe c K \u2212 \u03c0 \u00fe \u00de=\u03c3\u00f0e \u00fe e \u2212 \u2192 \u039b \u00fe c X\u00de of 1.5 \u00d7 10 \u22124 with a p \u00c3 \u00f0\u039b \u00fe c \u00de > 2.5 GeV=c requirement. Here, p \u00c3 \u00f0\u039b \u00fe c \u00de is the momentum of the \u039b \u00fe c in the center-of-mass (CM) frame.",

The beam energies and integrated luminosities are summarized in Table I. The luminosity-weighted average of ffiffi ffi s p is 10.59 GeV. The Belle detector is a large-solid-angle magnetic spectrometer that consists of a silicon vertex detector (SVD), a 50-layer central drift chamber (CDC), an array of aerogel threshold Cherenkov counters (ACC), a barrellike arrangement of time-of-flight scintillation counters (TOF), and an electromagnetic calorimeter comprised of CsI(Tl) crystals (ECL) located inside a superconducting solenoid coil that provides a 1.5 T magnetic field. An iron flux return located outside of the coil is instrumented to detect K 0 L mesons and to identify muons (KLM). The detector is described in detail elsewhere [38]. Two inner detector configurations were used. A 2.0 cm radius beampipe and a 3-layer silicon vertex detector were used for the first sample of 156 fb \u22121 , while a 1.5 cm radius beampipe, a 4-layer silicon detector and a small-cell inner drift chamber were used to record the remaining 824 fb \u22121 [39].",

The charged proton, kaon, and pion that are not associated with longlived particles like K 0 S , \u039b and \u039e \u2212 , are required to have a point of closest approach to the interaction point that is within 0.2 cm in the transverse (r-\u03d5) direction and within 2 cm along the z-axis. (The z-axis is opposite the positron beam direction.) For each track, the likelihood values L p , L K , and L \u03c0 are provided for the assumption of proton, kaon, and pion, respectively, from the hadron identification system, based on the ionization energy loss in the CDC, the number of detected Cherenkov photons in the ACC, and the time of flight measured by the TOF. The likelihood ratio is defined as L\u00f0i\u2236j\u00de \u00bc L i =\u00f0L i \u00fe L j \u00de and a track is identified as a proton if the likelihood ratios L\u00f0p\u2236\u03c0\u00de and L\u00f0p\u2236K\u00de are greater than 0.6. A track is identified as a kaon if the likelihood ratios L\u00f0K\u2236\u03c0\u00de and L\u00f0K\u2236p\u00de are greater than 0.6. A track is identified as a pion if the likelihood ratios L\u00f0\u03c0\u2236K\u00de and L\u00f0\u03c0\u2236p\u00de are greater than 0.6. In addition, electron (L e ) likelihood is provided based on information from the ECL, ACC, and CDC [40]. A track with an electron likelihood greater than 0.95 is rejected. The momentum averaged efficiencies of hadron identification are about 90%, 90%, and 93% for pions, kaons, and protons, respectively. The momentum averaged probability to misidentify a pion (kaon) track as a kaon (pion) track is about 9 (10)%, and the momentum averaged probability to misidentify a pion or kaon track as a proton track is about 5%.",

The K 0 S candidate is reconstructed from its decay into \u03c0 \u00fe \u03c0 \u2212 . A pair of oppositely charged pions that have an invariant mass within 8 MeV=c 2 of the nominal K 0 S mass, which corresponds to approximately 3.5\u03c3 of the mass resolution, is used. Two pion tracks are fitted to a common vertex. The result of the fit is used to suppress misreconstructed K 0 S candidates and to perform further vertex fit of the \u039b \u00fe c \u2192 pK 0 S . The vertex of the two pions for the K 0 S is required to be displaced from the interaction point (IP) in the direction of the pion pair momentum [46]. The daughters of the \u039b \u00fe c are fitted to a common vertex; the invariant mass of the daughters must be within 5\u00f06\u00de MeV=c 2 , or 1.5\u03c3, nominal \u039b \u00fe c mass for the pK \u2212 \u03c0 \u00fe (pK 0 S ) decay mode. The \u03c7 2 value of the common vertex fit of the \u039b \u00fe c is required to be less than 50. For the remaining candidate, a mass constraint fit to the \u039b \u00fe c mass is performed to improve the momentum resolution. As the signal-to-background ratio for the \u039b \u00fe c candidates is similar for the pK \u2212 \u03c0 \u00fe and pK 0 S decay modes, they are combined in the following analysis. By including the pK 0 S mode in addition to the pK \u2212 \u03c0 \u00fe mode, the yield of the \u039b \u00fe c is increased by about 20%.",

By including this factor, our measurement can be compared with the theoretical predictions [28,29]; while to compare with the prediction in Ref. [30], it is necessary to multiply our \u03c3 B measurement by 2 because they predicted the cross section of the pair production of the cc andcc diquarks.

First, we scan the likelihood profile by determining the likelihood values as a function of the \u03c3 B (L\u00f0\u03c3 B \u00de), varying N sig from zero up to the N sig value for which the likelihood drops to zero. Then, L\u00f0\u03c3 B \u00de is convolved with a Gaussian whose width equals the systematic uncertainties of \u03c3 B . The \u03c3 B value for which the integral (starting from \u03c3 B \u00bc 0) becomes 95% of the entire area is regarded as the 95% C.L. upper limit. We consider the following systematic uncertainties in the \u039e cc search. The systematic uncertainty due to the efficiency of pion and kaon identification is estimated from the ratio of the yield of the D \u00c3\u00fe \u2192 D 0 \u03c0 \u00fe , D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 \u00fe with and without the pion/kaon identification requirements for data and MC.

The ratio of the yields for partially and fully reconstructed signals in data and MC is compared, and the difference is taken as the systematic uncertainty. This amounts to 0.35% per track. The systematic uncertainty of the total integrated luminosity is 1.4%. To check the systematic error due to the signal PDF, we compare the mass resolution of the \u039b \u00fe c in data and MC. We find that the resolution for data is 5% larger than in MC. To monitor the effect of this discrepancy, we perform a pseudoexperiment test in which we extract the signal yield with correct PDF and one that is narrower by 5%. The largest difference of 3% measured in this test is regarded as the systematic uncertainty. The systematic uncertainty related to the \u039b \u00fe c branching fraction is propagated from the errors taken from the PDG [9]. To estimate the systematic uncertainty of the reconstruction efficiency due to the possible difference of x p spectrum between our assumption (the same as that of \u039b \u00fe c ) and the actual one, we examine the x p dependence of the reconstruction efficiency. The root mean square of the reconstruction efficiency in the region of 0.5 < x p < 1.0 is regarded as the systematic uncertainty. The elements of the systematic uncertainty for the measurement of the \u03c3 B are enumerated in the first and second columns of Table II C.

The \u039e c \u00f03123\u00de \u00fe component is generated with mass and width changed by AE1\u03c3, corresponding to their measured uncertainties (3122.9 AE 1.3AE 0.4 MeV=c 2 for the mass and 4.4 AE 3.4 AE 1.7 MeV=c 2 for the width). The yield of \u039e c \u00f03123\u00de \u00fe is extracted by fitting pseudoexperiment data with the procedure used for data. The ratio of the generated and extracted yield is regarded as a systematic uncertainty. Because the error of the width is relatively large, its systematic uncertainty contribution is dominant (28%).

The measured widths are found to be consistent between the three decay modes: 2.9 AE 0.3 MeV=c 2 , 2.6 AE 0.3 MeV=c 2 , and 2.5 AE 0.3 MeV=c 2 for \u039e 0 c \u2192 \u039e \u2212 \u03c0 \u00fe , \u039bK \u2212 \u03c0 \u00fe , and pK \u2212 K \u2212 \u03c0 \u00fe , respectively. The measured width is found to be consistent for the three decay modes. The systematic uncertainty of the width measurement due to the fit procedure is studied with pseudoexperiment events samples: the \u039e c \u00f02645\u00de \u00fe component is generated according to the signal MC sample with the natural width of 2.6 MeV=c 2 by signal MC, while contributions from background and \u039e c \u00f02790\u00de \u00fe reflection are generated based on the fit result with the real data. The statistics of the pseudoexperiment samples are the same as for those of data. The width of the \u039e c \u00f02645\u00de \u00fe is extracted from simultaneous fits to pseudoexperiment samples, and its mean value is obtained to be 2.75 AE 0.03 MeV=c 2 , which is higher than the input value by 0.15 MeV=c 2 . The difference is included as the systematic uncertainty from the fit procedure. The systematic uncertainty due to the background shape is studied by fitting the data with a second-order polynomial function for the alternative background shape. The fit region is restricted to 2.62-2.75 GeV=c 2 . The width is obtained to be 2.9 AE 0.2 MeV=c 2 , which is 0.3 MeV=c 2 higher than the default measurement. This deviation is included as a systematic uncertainty. To check the systematic uncertainty due to the mass resolution, we evaluate the ratio of the resolution of the \u039e 0 c in the data and MC, \u03c3 data \u03c3 mc , where \u03c3 data is the resolution of \u039e 0 c for data and \u03c3 mc is that for MC. An additional cut of 2.64GeV=c 2 <M\u00f0\u039e 0 c \u03c0 \u00fe \u00de<2.65GeV=c 2 is applied to select the \u039e c \u00f02645\u00de \u00fe region only. \u03c3 data \u03c3 mc is 0.96 AE 0.03, 1.03 AE 0.07, and 1.07 AE 0.03 for the \u039e \u2212 \u03c0 \u00fe , \u039bK \u2212 \u03c0 \u00fe , and pK \u2212 K \u2212 \u03c0 \u00fe decay modes, respectively. We assign the systematic uncertainty conservatively by increasing the mass resolution by 7%, which is the largest deviation of the \u03c3 data \u03c3 mc from unity, for all the decay modes. The resulting width is 2.5 AE 0.2 MeV=c 2 . The difference of 0.1 MeV=c 2 with respect to the default measurement is included as a systematic uncertainty. We use alternative x p ranges of 0.35 < x p < 1.0 and 0.55 < x p < 1.0 and extract the width of 2.6 AE 0.2 MeV=c 2 for the former case and 2.8 AE 0.2 MeV=c 2 for the latter. The largest difference of 0.2 MeV=c 2 with respect to the default measurement is included as a systematic uncertainty. By adding all the systematic uncertainties in quadrature, the total systematic uncertainty for the width measurement is estimated to be 0.4 MeV=c 2 .",

As an example, the relative yield ratio of the \u039e \u00fe cc with a mass of \u039e cc . A simultaneous UML fit, with the relative \u039e cc yields constrained as discussed earlier, is applied to evaluate the statistical significance of the \u039e cc . The signal PDF is described with MC events generated for each decay mode and with the \u039e cc mass generated in the search region with a 1 MeV=c 2 step. The mass resolution is 2.7-4.2 MeV=c 2 , depending on the mass of the \u039e cc . The background PDF is modeled as a third-order polynomial. The highest significance is 3.2\u03c3 for the mass around 3.553 GeV=c 2 in the M\u00f0\u039e 0 c \u03c0 \u00fe \u00de. We perform a pseudoexperiment test to evaluate the probability of observing a peak with such a statistical significance. A smooth mass distribution based on data is generated and the significance is evaluated in the entire search region. The probability to observe a peak with a significance higher than 3.2\u03c3 in one pseudoexperiment is 26%. Therefore, the statistical significance of 3.2\u03c3 is insufficient to claim evidence of the \u039e \u00fe cc .

When we compare these values with the measurements by BABAR, we should note several things. We should multiply our result by two as written in Sec. III. For the final states with \u039b \u00fe c , their upper limit is for the product of the cross section, B\u00f0\u039e \u00fe\u00f0\u00fe\u00de cc \u2192 \u039b \u00fe c K \u2212 \u03c0 \u00fe \u00f0\u03c0 \u00fe \u00de\u00de and B\u00f0\u039b \u00fe c \u2192 pK \u2212 \u03c0 \u00fe \u00de. The values presented in Ref. [34] are the highest upper limits in the search region, which can be compared with our highest values. After taking into account these points, we find our limits represent improvements by about a factor two for the final states with \u039b \u00fe c and a factor of four for the final states with \u039e 0",
