The two-stage spectrometer has large acceptance and covers a wide kinematic range for charged as well as neutral particles allowing to access a wide range of reactions. Light mesons are studied with negative (mostly \u03c0 \u2212 ) and positive (p, \u03c0 + ) hadron beams with a momentum of 190 GeV/c. The light-meson spectrum is measured in different final states produced in diffractive dissociation reactions with squared four-momentum transfer t to the target between 0.1 and 1.0 (GeV/c) 2 . The flagship channel is the \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 final state, for which C\uf76f\uf76d\uf770\uf761\uf773\uf773 has recorded the currently world's largest data sample. These data not only allow us to measure the properties of known resonances with high precision, but also to search for new states. Among these is a new axial-vector signal, the a 1 (1420), with unusual properties. The findings are confirmed by the analysis of the \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 final state.",

All these amplitudes are multiplied by complex-valued coefficients C, that describe strength and phase of the respective model component. These \"couplings\" may vary with t . The fact, that the couplings, as well as the non-resonant terms may vary with t , while the Breit-Wigner amplitudes may not, allows to better disentangle both contributions. For the fit presented here, we selected a subset of 14 waves with 6 different J PC quantum numbers out of the 88 waves in the analysis model to be used in the resonance-model fit. To describe these waves, we use a total of 11 resonances. This model has 722 free parameters that are determined in a \u03c7 2 fit. Most of them, however, are coupling coefficients and as enter only to the 4 th order in the \u03c7 2 function which makes them easy to determine. They are used to extract t spectra of the resonances, which we will not cover in this article. Only 51 parameters are \"shape parameters\", e.g. masses and width of the resonances, and will therefore be discussed here.

At the moment simple Breit-Wigner amplitudes and functions without phase motion for non-resonant contributions are used, but we are making efforts to use more advanced parameterizations that fulfill the requirement of analyticity and unitarity.
