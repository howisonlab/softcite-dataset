The search is performed in the H \u2192 \u03bc\u03c4 e and H \u2192 \u03bc\u03c4 h channels, where \u03c4 e and \u03c4 h are tau leptons reconstructed in the electronic and hadronic decay channels, respectively. The data sample used in this search was collected in pp collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of \u221a s = 8 TeV with the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC and corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb \u22121 . The sensitivity of the search is an order of magnitude better than the existing indirect limits. A slight excess of signal events with a significance of 2.4 standard deviations is observed. The p-value of this excess at M H = 125 GeV is 0.010. The best fit branching fraction is B(H \u2192 \u03bc\u03c4 ) = (0.84 +0.39    \u22120.37 )%. A constraint on the branching fraction, B(H \u2192 \u03bc\u03c4 ) < 1.51% at 95% confidence level is set. This limit is subsequently used to constrain the \u03bc-\u03c4 Yukawa couplings to be less than 3.6 \u00d7 10 \u22123 .",

            "text": "The discovery of the Higgs boson (H) [1][2][3] has generated great interest in exploring its properties. In the standard model (SM), lepton-flavour-violating (LFV) decays are forbidden if the theory is to be renormalizable [4]. If this requirement is relaxed, so the theory is valid only to a finite mass scale, then LFV couplings may be introduced. LFV decays can occur naturally in models with more than one Higgs doublet without abandoning renormalizability [5]. They also arise in supersymmetric models [6][7][8][9], composite Higgs boson models [10,11], models with flavour symmetries [12], Randall-Sundrum models [13][14][15], and many others [16][17][18][19][20][21][22][23]. The presence of LFV couplings would allow \u03bc \u2192 e, \u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc and \u03c4 \u2192 e transitions to proceed via a virtual Higgs boson [24,25]. The experimental limits on these have recently been translated into constraints on the branching fractions B(H \u2192 e\u03bc, \u03bc\u03c4 , e\u03c4 ) [4,26]. The \u03bc \u2192 e transition is strongly constrained by null search results for \u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3 [27], B(H \u2192 \u03bce) < O (10 \u22128 ). However, the constraints on \u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc and \u03c4 \u2192 e are much less stringent. These come from searches for \u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc\u03b3 [28,29] and other rare \u03c4 decays [30], \u03c4 \u2192 e\u03b3 , \u03bc and eg \u2212 2 measurements [27]. Exclusion limits on the electron and muon electric dipole moments [31] also provide complementary constraints. These lead to the much less restrictive limits: B(H \u2192 \u03bc\u03c4 ) < O(10%), B(H \u2192 e\u03c4 ) < O(10%). The observation of the Higgs boson offers the possibility of sensitive direct E-mail address: cms-publication-committee-chair@cern.ch. searches for LFV Higgs boson decays. To date no dedicated searches have been performed. However, a theoretical reinterpretation of the ATLAS H \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 search results in terms of LFV decays by an independent group has been used to set limits at the 95% confidence level (CL) of B(H \u2192 \u03bc\u03c4 ) < 13%, B(H \u2192 e\u03c4 ) < 13% [4]. are tau leptons reconstructed in the electronic and hadronic decay channels, respectively. The signature is very similar to the SM H \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bc \u03c4 e and H \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bc \u03c4 h decays, where \u03c4 \u03bc is a tau lepton decaying muonically, which have been studied by CMS in Refs. [32,33] and ATLAS in Ref. [34], but with some significant kinematic differences. The \u03bc comes promptly from the LFV H decay and tends to have a larger momentum than in the SM case. There is only one tau lepton so there are typically fewer neutrinos in the decay. They are highly Lorentz boosted and tend to be collinear with the visible \u03c4 decay products.",

The signal sensitivity is enhanced by using different selection criteria for each category. The dominant production mechanism is gluon-gluon fusion but there is also a significant contribution from vector boson fusion which is enhanced by requiring jets to be present in the event.

Less significant backgrounds come from Z \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 and Z + jets. The principal backgrounds are estimated using data. There is also a small background from SM H decays which is estimated with simulation. The presence or absence of a signal is established by fitting a mass distribution for signal and background using the asymptotic CL s criterion [35,36]. A \"blind\" analysis was performed. The data in the signal region were not studied until the selection criteria had been fixed and the background estimate finalized.",

The momenta of charged particles are measured with a silicon pixel and strip tracker that covers the pseudorapidity range |\u03b7| < 2.5 and is inside a 3.8 T axial magnetic field. Surrounding the tracker are a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) and a brass/scintillator hadron calorimeter, both consisting of a barrel assembly and two endcaps that extend to a pseudorapidity range of |\u03b7| < 3.0. A steel/quartzfiber Cherenkov forward detector extends the calorimetric coverage to |\u03b7| < 5.0. The outermost component of the CMS detector is the muon system, consisting of gas-ionization detectors placed in the steel flux-return yoke of the magnet to measure the momenta of muons traversing the detector. The two-level CMS trigger system selects events of interest for permanent storage. The first trigger level, composed of custom hardware processors, uses information from the calorimeters and muon detectors to select events in less than 3.2 \u03bcs. The high-level trigger software algorithms, executed on a farm of commercial processors, further reduce the event rate using information from all detector subsystems.",

The neutrino momenta can be approximated to be in the same direction as the other visible decay products of the \u03c4 and the component of the missing transverse energy in the transverse direction of the visible \u03c4 decay products is used to estimate the transverse component of the neutrino momentum.

This occurs only in the H \u2192 \u03bc\u03c4 e channel. The M col distribution has been corrected for this effect and a 100% uncertainty on this shift is used as a systematic uncertainty for the possible bias. The jet energy scale has been studied extensively and a standard prescription for corrections [65] is used in all CMS analyses. The overall scale is set using \u03b3 + jets events and the most significant uncertainty arises from the photon energy scale. A number of other uncertainties such as jet fragmentation modeling, single pion response and uncertainties in the pileup corrections are also included. The jet energy scale uncertainties (3-7%) are applied as a function of p T and \u03b7, including all correlations, to all jets in the event, propagated to the missing energy, and the resultant M col distribution is used in the fit. There is also an additional uncertainty to account for the unclustered energy scale uncertainty. The unclustered energy comes from jets below 10 GeV and PF candidates not within jets. It is also propagated to the missing transverse energy. These effects cause a shift of the M col distribution. The \u03c4 energy scale is estimated by comparing Z \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4 events in data and simulation.",
