Significant data samples of polarized protons colliding against gold (A = 197) and aluminum (A = 27) nuclei were obtained. With these new data, there are a few observables and possible implications available. The first natural question from a spin physics point of view is how A N in p \u2191 + A compares to that in p \u2191 + p collisions. One implication of this comparison is its use as a possible probe of gluon saturation: the color glass condensate model predicts that A N in p \u2191 + A decreases as A increases [5]. The nuclear modification factor, R pA , and its kinematic-dependences can also be assessed. Dependences of A N on event topology can also be compared between p \u2191 + A and p \u2191 + p collisions, possibly leading to insight on fragmentation universality. Finally, dependences of A N as well as R pA on collision centrality is another avenue for exploring possible effects a nuclear medium has on these observables.",

This dependence was studied again in the 2015 p + p data and was compared to the p + Au sample. For a given \u03c0 0 in a 35 mrad isolation cone, the next highest energy photon cluster with E > 3 GeV outside the isolation cone was considered; its (\u03b7, \u03c6 )-position relative to that of the \u03c0 0 was denoted (\u2206\u03b7, \u2206\u03c6 ). The \u03c0 0 events were then separated into two isolation classes: those with electromagnetic energy deposited \u2206\u03c6 < 100 mrad from the \u03c0 0 and its more-isolated complement, \u2206\u03c6 > 100 mrad.

Its dependence on event topology is also similar for both cases: isolated \u03c0 0 s are associated with higher values of A N .
