            "text": "The decay of J/\u03c8 to three photons is studied using \u03c8(3686) \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8 in a sample of 1.0641 \u00d7 10 8 \u03c8(3686) events collected with the BESIII detector. Evidence of the direct decay of \u03b7c to two photons, \u03b7c \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3, is reported, and the product branching fraction is determined to be B(J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7c, \u03b7c \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3) = (4.5 \u00b1 1.2 \u00b1 0.6) \u00d7 10 \u22126 , where the first error is statistical and the second is systematic. The branching fraction for J/\u03c8 \u2192 3\u03b3 is measured to be (11.3 \u00b1 1.8 \u00b1 2.0) \u00d7 10 \u22126 with improved precision. Decays of positronium to more than one photon are regarded as an ideal test-bed for quantum electrodynamics (QED) [1], while the analogous processes in charmonia act as a probe of the strong interaction [2]. For example, the decay J/\u03c8 \u2192 3\u03b3 has a relatively simple theoretical description, and the experimental measurements allow for a fundamental test of non-perturbative quantum chromodynamics (QCD) [3]. The decay rate of J/\u03c8 \u2192 3\u03b3 is approximately proportional to the cube of the QED coupling constant \u03b1 3 \u2248 ( 1 137 ) 3 . To reduce model dependence, the branching fraction for J/\u03c8 \u2192 3\u03b3 is normalized by the branching fraction for J/\u03c8 \u2192 e + e \u2212 . The ratio R \u2261 B(J/\u03c8 \u2192 3\u03b3) B(J/\u03c8 \u2192 e + e \u2212 ) = 64(\u03c0 2 \u2212 9) 243\u03c0 \u03b1(1\u22127.3 \u03b1 s (r) \u03c0 )",

From the ratio B(J/\u03c8 \u2192 3g)/B(J/\u03c8 \u2192 e + e \u2212 ) [5], a value of \u03b1 s \u2248 0.19 can be obtained; inserting this into Eq. (1) then gives R \u2248 2.96 \u00d7 10 \u22124 . This ratio is sensitive to QCD corrections only. It is still unclear, though, how radiative and relativistic QCD corrections should be treated [6] and how they may affect this ratio. Experimental constraints on this ratio can help us to understand the behavior of non-perturbative QCD, which would shed light on the dynamics of charmonium. In addition, the photon energy spectrum in J/\u03c8 \u2192 3\u03b3 reveals the internal structure of the J/\u03c8, since the photon spectrum at energy \u03c9 is sensitive to the distance r \u223c 1/ \u221a m c \u03c9 [4]. The CLEO collaboration was the first to report the observation of J/\u03c8 \u2192 3\u03b3, measuring its branching fraction to be B(J/\u03c8 \u2192 3\u03b3) = (12 \u00b1 3 \u00b1 2) \u00d7 10 \u22126 [7]. This corresponds to a value of R = (2.0 \u00b1 0.6) \u00d7 10 \u22124 , which disagrees with the prediction given by Eq. (1). Looking at the J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7 c , \u03b7 c \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 mode, the analysis of B(\u03b7 c \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3) is determined mainly from two-photon fusion \u03b3\u03b3 ( * ) \u2192 \u03b7 c [8], because of low statistics for direct measurements of the decay. The most precise direct measure-ment of B(\u03b7 c \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3) to date comes from BELLE, with a significance of 4.1\u03c3 [9]. The J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7 c , \u03b7 c \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 branching fraction is predicted to be (4.4 \u00b1 1.1) \u00d7 10 \u22126 [10], if higher-order QCD corrections are not taken into account. CLEO reported an upper limit of B(J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7 c , \u03b7 c \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3) < 6 \u00d7 10 \u22126 at 90% confidence level [7].",

In order to model this background, taking advantage of the structure of intermediate resonances, a partial wave analysis (PWA) [18] is performed on a \u03b3\u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 sample based on 2.25 \u00d7 10 8 J/\u03c8 events recorded at the J/\u03c8 resonance at BESIII [19].

Here, M (\u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 ) is the invariant mass of two \u03c0 0 and \u03b8 is the polar angle of the \u03c0 0 with respect to the beam axis.

This discrepancy is due to the tracking simulation of low momentum pions. Since the J/\u03c8 mass window is sufficiently broad to cover the peak region in both data and MC simulation, the efficiency of the mass window requirement should not be significantly affected. The relevant systematic uncertainty is studied with a J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7, \u03b7 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 control sample.

Since the M (\u03b3\u03b3) lg mass distribution does depend on the components of the intermediate structures, however, it is important to obtain a good understanding of the primary components using PWA. Information about the amplitudes in J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3\u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 from the previous BESII analysis [18] is also used in the simulation as an additional check; the relative change of 2% in the results is taken as the systematic uncertainty due to the PWA model. The photon detection efficiency is studied with different control samples, such as radiative Bhabha and \u03c8(3686) \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8, J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c1 0 \u03c0 0 events [23]. A systematic uncertainty of 1% is assigned for each photon over the kinematic region covered in this work, so a total of 3% is assigned for the three photons in the final states studied. The MDC tracking efficiency is studied using selected samples of J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c1\u03c0 and \u03c8(3686) \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 J/\u03c8, J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 pp events [24]. The disagreement between data and MC simulation is within 1% for each pion, so 2% is assigned as the total systematic uncertainty for the two pions. Samples of J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7, \u03b7 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 events are selected to study uncertainties arising from requirements on the number of photon candidates and the \u03c7 2 4C requirement, which are given as 0.5% and 2%, respectively. The uncertainty due to the fitting is estimated to be 5% by changing the fitting range and the bin width.",

This is clearly incompatible with the calculation in Eq. 1, which indicates that further improvements of the QCD radiative and relativistic corrections are needed. A study in Ref.
