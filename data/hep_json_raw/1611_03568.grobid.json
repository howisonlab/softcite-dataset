The dijet mass spectrum is well described by a smooth parameterization and no significant evidence for the production of new particles is observed. Upper limits at 95% confidence level are reported on the production cross section for narrow resonances with masses above 0.6 TeV. In the context of specific models, the limits exclude string resonances with masses below 7.4 TeV, scalar diquarks below 6.9 TeV, axigluons and colorons below 5.5 TeV, excited quarks below 5.4 TeV, color-octet scalars below 3.0 TeV, W bosons below 2.7 TeV, Z bosons below 2.1 TeV and between 2.3 and 2.6 TeV, and RS gravitons below 1.9 TeV. These extend previous limits in the dijet channel. Vector and axial-vector mediators in a simplified model of interactions between quarks and dark matter are excluded below 2.0 TeV. The first limits in the dijet channel on dark matter mediators are presented as functions of dark matter mass and are compared to the exclusions of dark matter in direct detection experiments.",

Many models of physics beyond the standard model (SM) require new particles that couple to quarks (q) and gluons (g) and can be observed as resonances in the dijet mass spectrum. One example is a model in which dark matter (DM) particles couple to quarks through a DM mediator. This mediator can decay to either a pair of DM particles or a pair of jets and therefore can be observed as a dijet resonance [1]. Here, we report a search for narrow dijet resonances, which are those with natural widths that are small compared to the experimental mass resolution.",

Particles are classified as muons, electrons, photons, and either charged or neutral hadrons. Jets are reconstructed either using particle flow, giving PF-jets, or from energy deposits in the calorimeters, giving Calo-jets. PF-jets reconstructed offline are used in the high-mass search, and Calo-jets reconstructed by the HLT are used in the low-mass search. To reconstruct both types of jets, we use the anti-k T algorithm [34,35] with a distance parameter of 0.4, as implemented in the FastJet package [36]. For the high-mass search, at least one reconstructed vertex is required. The primary vertex is defined as the vertex with the highest sum of p 2 T of the associated tracks. For PF-jets, charged PF candidates not originating from the primary vertex are removed prior to the jet finding. For both types of jets, an event-by-event correction based on jet area [37,38] is applied to the jet energy to remove the estimated contribution from additional collisions in the same or adjacent bunch crossings (pileup).",

The HLT uses H T , the scalar sum of the jet p T from all jets in the event with |\u03b7| < 3 that satisfy a jet p T requirement, to select events. For the high-mass search, PF-jets with p T > 30 GeV are used to compute H T , and events are accepted by the HLT if they satisfy the requirement H T > 800 GeV. We then select events with m jj > 1.06 TeV for which the combined L1 trigger and HLT are found to be fully efficient. For the low-mass search, when an event passes the HLT, the Calo-jets reconstructed at the HLT are saved, along with the event energy density and missing transverse momentum reconstructed from the calorimeter. The shorter time for event reconstruction of calorimeter quantities and the reduced event size recorded for these events allow a reduced H T threshold compared to the high-mass search. For the low-mass search, Calo-jets with p T > 40 GeV are used to compute H T , the threshold is H T > 250 GeV, and we select events with m jj > 0.45 TeV for which the trigger is fully efficient.",

The jet ID for PF-jets is described in Ref. [39]. The jet ID for Calo-jets requires that the jet be detected by both the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters with the fraction of jet energy deposited within the electromagnetic calorimeter between 5 and 95% of the total jet energy. An event is rejected if either of the two leading jets fails the jet ID criteria. Spatially close jets are combined into \"wide jets\" and used to determine the dijet mass, as in the previous CMS searches [4,6, 7,10]. The wide-jet algorithm, designed for dijet resonance event reconstruction, reduces the analysis sensitivity to gluon radiation from the final-state partons. The two leading jets are used as seeds and the four-vectors of all other jets, if within R = ( \u03b7) 2 + ( \u03c6) 2 < 1.1, are added to the nearest leading jet to obtain two wide jets, which then form the dijet system. The background from t-channel dijet events peaks at large values of | \u03b7 jj | and is suppressed by requiring the pseudorapidity separation of the two wide jets to satisfy | \u03b7 jj | < 1.3. The above requirements maximize the search sensitivity for isotropic decays of dijet resonances in the presence of QCD dijet background. For the low-mass search, after wide jet reconstruction and event selection, we use a correction derived from a smaller sample of dijet data to calibrate the wide jets reconstructed from Calo-jets at HLT. With this correction, based on a dijet balance tag-and-probe method similar to that discussed in Ref. [38], the wide jets from Calo-jets have the same response as those reconstructed from PF-jets. Fig. 1 shows the dijet mass spectra, defined as the observed number of events in each bin divided by the integrated luminosity and the bin width, with predefined bins of width corresponding to the dijet mass resolution [12]. The highest mass event has a dijet mass of 7.7 TeV. The dijet mass spectra for both the high-and low-mass searches are fit with the following parameterization:",

This uncertainty is propagated to the limits by shifting the dijet mass shape for signal by \u00b12%. The uncertainty in the jet energy resolution translates into an uncertainty of 10% in the resolution of the dijet mass [38], and is propagated to the limits by observing the effect of increasing and decreasing by 10% the reconstructed width of the dijet mass shape for signal. The uncertainty in the integrated luminosity is 6.2%, and is propagated to the normalization of the signal.

We use a multi-bin counting experiment likelihood, which is a product of Poisson distributions corresponding to different bins. We evaluate the likelihood independently at each value of resonance pole mass from 0.6 to 1.6 TeV in 50-GeV steps in the low-mass search, and from 1.6 to 7.5 TeV in 100-GeV steps in the high-mass search. The systematic uncertainties are implemented as nuisance parameters in the likelihood model, with Gaussian constraints for the jet energy scale and resolution, and log-normal constraints for the integrated luminosity. The systematic uncertainty in the background is automatically evaluated via profiling, effectively refitting for the optimal values of the background parameters for each value of resonance cross section. This procedure gives the same limits as the Bayesian procedure used previously for dijet resonance searches at CMS [4]. For both the Bayesian and modified frequentist statistical procedures we find that the background systematic uncertainty has the largest effect on the limit. The extent to which the background uncertainty affects the limit depends significantly on the signal shape and the resonance mass, with the largest effect occurring for the gg resonances because they are wider, and the smallest effect for qq resonances. The effect decreases as the resonance mass increases. For example, considering two signals shown in Fig. 1: for a gg resonance at a mass of 0.75 TeV systematic uncertainties increase the limit by a factor of 3, and for a qq resonance at a mass of 6 TeV systematic uncertainties increase the limit by only 10%.",

The branching fraction includes the direct decays of the resonance into the five light quarks and gluons only, excluding top quarks from the decay, although top quarks are included in the calculation of the resonance width. The acceptance is evaluated at the parton level for the resonance decay to two partons. In the case of isotropic decays, the acceptance is A \u2248 0.6 and is independent of the resonance mass.

The limits in Fig. 4 are first re-calculated at 90% CL, and then translated into the plane of the DM mass versus the DM-nucleon interaction cross section from the predicted relation between the interaction cross section and the mediator mass. An axial-vector mediator leads to a spin-dependent cross section, \u03c3 SD , and a vector mediator leads to a spin-independent cross section, \u03c3 SI . Fig. 5 shows the comparison of these results with dark matter searches by direct detec- Fig. 4. The 95% CL observed (solid) and expected (dashed) excluded regions in the plane of dark matter mass vs. mediator mass, for an axial-vector mediator (top) and a vector mediator (bottom), are compared to constraints from the cosmological relic density of DM (light gray) determined from astrophysical measurements [51,52] and MadDM version 2.0.6 [53,54] as described in Ref. [55]. Following the recommendation of the LHC DM working group [27,28], the exclusions are computed for Dirac DM and for a universal quark coupling g q = 0.25 and for a DM coupling of g DM = 1.0. It should also be noted that the excluded region strongly depends on the chosen coupling and model scenario. Therefore, the excluded regions and relic density contours shown in this plot are not applicable to other choices of coupling values or models.",

The gap in the CMS excluded region in Fig. 5 corresponds to a structure with a statistical significance of one standard deviation seen at a mass of 2.2 TeV in Figs. 1-4. For our benchmark model the present search excludes a significantly smaller \u03c3 SD than the direct detection experiments, and a competitive region of \u03c3 SI . We note that the absolute exclusion of this search, as well as its relative importance with respect to other dark matter searches, strongly depends on the chosen coupling and model scenario. Nevertheless, this benchmark model, a vector or an axialvector mediator with a universal quark coupling g q = 0.25 and a DM coupling of g DM = 1.0, illustrates that dijet searches can place significant bounds on relevant DM models and thus are important ingredients in the search for DM.",

Limits on the mass of a dark matter mediator are presented as a function of dark matter mass, and are translated into upper limits on the cross section for dark matter particles scattering on nucleons that are more sensitive than those of direct detection experiments for spin-dependent cross sections.",
