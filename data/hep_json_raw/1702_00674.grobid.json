The analysis utilises an integrated luminosity of 0.14 nb \u22121 of Pb+Pb data and 4.0 pb \u22121 of pp data collected in 2011 and 2013, respectively, at the same centre-of-mass energy of 2.76 TeV per colliding nucleon pair. The distributions measured in pp collisions are used as a reference for those measured in Pb+Pb collisions in order to evaluate the impact on the internal structure of jets from the jet energy loss of fast partons propagating through the hot, dense medium created in heavy-ion collisions. Modest but significant centrality-dependent modifications of fragmentation functions in Pb+Pb collisions with respect to those in pp collisions are seen. No significant dependence of modifications on jet p T and rapidity selections is observed except for the fragments with the highest transverse momenta for which some reduction of yields is observed for more forward jets. ation of the LHC, as well as the support staff from our institutions without whom ATLAS could not be operated efficiently.

            "text": "Heavy-ion collisions at ultra-relativistic energies produce a medium of strongly interacting nuclear matter composed of deconfined colour charges which is commonly called a quark-gluon plasma (QGP) [1][2][3][4]. Hard-scattering processes occurring in these collisions produce high transverse momentum, p T , partons that propagate through the medium and lose energy. This phenomenon is termed \"jet quenching\". More specifically, jet quenching is a process in which constituents of the parton shower may be elastically or inelastically scattered by the constituents of the plasma, resulting in the suppression of jet production and the modification of the internal structure of jets [5][6][7]. Inclusive-jet suppression has e-mail: atlas.publications@cern.ch been measured previously at the LHC in terms of the nuclear modification factor [8][9][10][11][12]. A suppression of jet production by about a factor of two in central heavy-ion collisions was observed. The internal structure of jets was also measured [13][14][15][16] and these measurements revealed modification of the distributions of the jet fragments. The measurements of the jet structure were supplemented by a measurement of the correlation of the jet suppression with missing transverse momentum [17], leading to a conclusion that the energy lost by partons is transferred predominantly to soft particles being radiated at large angles with respect to the direction of the original parton.",

The primary vertices were reconstructed from charged-particle tracks with p T > 0.5 GeV. The tracks were reconstructed from hits in the inner detector using the standard track-reconstruction algorithm [21] with settings optimised for the high hit density in heavy-ion collisions [22]. The Pb+Pb events were selected for recording by a combination of Level-1 minimum-bias and high level trigger (HLT) jet triggers. The Level-1 trigger required a total transverse energy measured in the calorimeter of greater than 10 GeV. The HLT jet trigger ran the offline Pb+Pb jetreconstruction algorithm, described below, for R = 0.2 jets except for the application of the final hadronic energy-scale correction. The HLT selected events containing an R = 0.2 jet with transverse energy E T > 20 GeV in the |\u03b7| < 3.2 range. A total of 14.2 million events satisfied these event selection criteria.

The tower kinematics were obtained by summing electromagnetic-scale energies [30] of massless calorimeter cells within the tower boundaries. In the case of the reconstruction of jets in Pb+Pb collisions, an underlying event (UE) subtraction was performed in the following way. An iterative procedure was used to estimate a layerdependent and pseudorapidity-dependent UE energy density while excluding jets from that estimate. The UE energy was corrected for the presence of the elliptic flow [31], which was subtracted from each calorimeter cell within the towers included in the reconstructed jet. The final jet kinematics were calculated via a four-momentum sum of all cell energy deposits (assumed massless) contained within the jet. The UE contribution was subtracted at the cell level. A correction was applied to the reconstructed jet to account for jets not excluded or only partially excluded from the UE estimate. Finally, the jet y-and E T -dependent hadronic energy-scale calibration factor was applied in both the pp and Pb+Pb collisions.",

The tracking efficiency \u03b5 was obtained as a ratio of tracks that have an associated truth charged particle to all the truth charged particles. To guarantee smooth behaviour of the correction factors as a function of track p T , the tracking efficiency was parameterised in the region of 1 < p T < 90 GeV using a fourth-order polynomial in the logarithm of the track p T . This functional form gives a good description of the onset of the efficiency at low p T as well as the behaviour in the intermediatep T region. At the same time it is not susceptible to statistical fluctuations in these regions. However, in the region of p T > 90 GeV the polynomial in the logarithm does not provide a good parameterisation of efficiencies. The study of the highp T behaviour in both the pp and Pb+Pb simulations showed that the tracking efficiency generally continues to follow the linear trend present at p T < 90 GeV. Thus, the result of the fit using a polynomial in the logarithm for tracks with p T > 90 GeV was replaced by a linear function with the slope determined from the difference between the fitted efficiencies at p T = 70 GeV and p T = 90 GeV. The value of the slope does not exceed 0.001. The efficiency for reconstructing tracks along with its parameterisation is shown in Fig. 1.

The upfeeding was observed in the MC simulation to induce a difference between the determined UE yields, as described above, and the actual UE contribution to reconstructed jets.

The average fractional mismatch in the estimated UE background was found to have a minor dependence on p ch T and p jet T and to vary with centrality by factors of 0-20% with respect to the original UE estimates. To correct for this effect, multiplicative correction factors, dependent on centrality, y jet , p jet T and p ch T (or z) were applied to the dn UE ch /d p ch T (or dn UE ch /dz) distributions. These multiplicative factors were estimated in MC samples as a ratio of UE distributions calculated from tracks within the area of a jet which do not have an associated truth particle and the UE distributions estimated by the cone method.

There are two main resolution effects: smearing due to finite jet energy resolution and smearing due to finite track momentum resolution. The former involves unfolding in p jet T ; the latter involves unfolding in p ch T . Since the tracks were measured in jets, a two-dimensional unfolding needs to be used to correct for both of these resolution effects simultaneously. The two-dimensional Bayesian unfolding algorithm [33] from the RooUnfold package [34] was used for this purpose. Using the MC samples, four-dimensional response matrices were created using the truth and reconstructed p jet T and the truth and reconstructed p ch T for reconstructed charged particles satisfying the track selection criteria defined in Sect. 4. The response matrices were created separately for pp and Pb+Pb data for each centrality and rapidity range. The entries in the response matrix were weighted by the tracking efficiency correction. Five iterations in the Bayesian unfolding procedure were found sufficient to deliver a stable result that does not change with increasing numbers of iterations for all centrality bins except for the 0-10% centrality bin where, eight iterations were used. Once the two-dimensional distributions were unfolded, a projection to a given p jet T interval was made, and the distribution was normalised by the respective number of jets.",

The distributions with shifted p T were unfolded and compared to the original distributions. The fractional difference was used as an estimate of the systematic uncertainty. The size of the JES uncertainty for D( p T ) and D(z) distributions in pp collisions is typically below 2% but can reach 4 and 6% at high p T and z, respectively. In Pb+Pb collisions, the typical size of this uncertainty is the same as in pp collisions, but the maximal uncertainty can reach 15% at the largest p T or z. The JES uncertainty partially cancels in ratios of Pb+Pb and pp distributions where a typical JES uncertainty is below 1% and the maximal uncertainty is below 10% at high p T . To account for systematic uncertainties due to any disagreement between the JER in data and MC simulation, the unfolding procedure was repeated with a modified response matrix. The new matrix was generated by repeating the MC study with the p T of reconstructed jets smeared by a relative uncertainty estimated as a function of y and p T of the jet [30]. The size of the JER uncertainty is usually at the level of 1% but grows at high p T or z, where the maximum is \u22486%. The systematic uncertainty due to track reconstruction was estimated by performing the analysis with three different sets of selection criteria imposed on tracks, called \"loose\", \"standard\", and \"tight\". The standard selection criteria were used as a default in this analysis. The differences in the result obtained using loose and tight criteria with respect to the result obtained using the standard criteria were used as the estimate of the systematic uncertainty. The tight selection criteria imposed more stringent requirements on the track quality, leading to a 15-20% reduction of the tracking efficiency depending on the track p T , \u03b7, and centrality. The loose selection criteria imposed more relaxed requirements on track quality leading to a 5-10% enhancement of tracking efficiency. The differences in the selection criteria bring significant differences both in the magnitude and the p T dependence of the tracking efficiency. The track reconstruction uncertainty is usually largest systematic uncertainty at low and intermediate p T or z. This uncertainty is typically less than 4%. Also related to tracking are the uncertainty in the estimate of fake tracks and the uncertainty due to the parameterisation of tracking efficiencies. Both of these uncertainties are less than 2%.",

The changes in the total transverse momentum follow the trends seen in R D( p T ) distributions. However, for the highp T region, the significance of the increase in yields is more pronounced in R D( p T ) distributions than in the P ch T distribution. The difference defined in Eq. (15) can also be evaluated over the full range of charged-particle transverse momenta, 1 < p ch T < 100 GeV. It may be expected that such P ch T should be identical to zero since the same range of the p jet T was used in Pb+Pb and pp collisions. The result of this evaluation is presented in the second row of Table 1. Indeed, the P ch T evaluated over the full range of charged-particle transverse momenta is consistent with zero within one standard deviation of combined statistical and systematic uncertain-   The total difference in the yield of charged particles can also be evaluated by integrating the D( p T ) distributions over the full range of charged-particle transverse momenta. In this case, one does not expect to see the same yields of charged particles in Pb+Pb and pp collisions since this quantity may change as a result of the jet quenching.
