            "text": "Diffractive processes such as ep \u2192 eXY , where the systems X and Y are separated in rapidity, have been studied extensively in deep-inelastic scattering (DIS) at the electron 1 -proton collider HERA [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8]. Diffractive DIS events can be viewed as resulting from processes in which the photon probes a net colour singlet combination of exchanged partons. The photon virtuality Q 2 , the high transverse momentum of jets or a heavy quark mass can provide a hard scale for perturbative QCD calculations. For semi-inclusive DIS processes such as ep \u2192 eXp the hard scattering QCD collinear factorisation theorem [9] allows the definition of diffractive parton distribution functions (DPDFs). The dependence of diffractive DIS on a hard scale can thus be treated in a manner similar to the treatment of inclusive DIS, for example through the application of the DGLAP parton evolution equations [10][11][12][13][14]. DPDFs have been determined from QCD fits to diffractive DIS measurements at HERA [2,3,8]. The inclusive diffractive DIS cross section is directly proportional to the sum of the quark DPDFs and constrains the gluon DPDF via scaling violations. The production of diffractive hadronic final states containing heavy quarks or jets proceeds mainly via boson gluon fusion (BGF) and therefore directly constrains the diffractive gluon density [3,8].",

The main advantage of the LRG method is its high acceptance for diffractive processes. A complementary way to study diffraction is by direct measurement of the outgoing proton, which remains in-tact in elastic interactions. This is achieved by the H1 experiment using the Forward Proton Spectrometer (FPS) [15,16], which is a set of tracking detectors along the proton beam line. Despite the low geometrical acceptance of the FPS, this method of selecting diffractive events has several advantages. The squared four-momentum transfer at the proton vertex, t, can be reconstructed with the FPS, while this is only possible in exclusive final states in the LRG case. The FPS method selects events in which the proton scatters elastically, whereas the LRG method does not distinguish between the case where the scattered proton remains intact or where it dissociates into a system of low mass M Y . The FPS method also allows measurements to be performed at higher values of fractional proton longitudinal momentum loss, x P , than possible using the LRG method.",

The universality of DPDFs is studied using events with two central jets. The distributions of the proton vertex variables x P and t are compared to those of the inclusive diffractive DIS case. This comparison tests the proton vertex factorisation hypothesis which assumes that the DIS variable factorise from the four-momentum of the final state proton. The data are also compared directly with the LRG measurement of the dijet cross section in diffractive DIS [3] in order to test the compatibility of the two experimental techniques. Finally, events with one central and one forward jet are used to investigate diffractive DIS in a region of phase space where effects beyond DGLAP parton evolution may be enhanced. This topology is not accessible with the LRG method since the rapidity gap requirement limits the pseudorapidity of the reconstructed jets to the central region. Figure 1 illustrates the dominant process for diffractive dijet production in DIS. The incoming electron with fourmomentum k interacts with the proton with four-momentum P via the exchange of a virtual photon with four-momentum q. The DIS kinematic variables are defined as: ",

The diffractive cross section is dominated by a trajectory usually called the Pomeron (P). In analyses of HERA data [2,3,8], diffractive DIS cross sections are interpreted assuming 'proton vertex factorisation' which provides a description of diffractive DIS in terms of a resolved Pomeron [17,18]. The QCD factorisation theorem and DGLAP parton evolution equations are applied to the dependence of the cross section on Q 2 and \u03b2, while a Regge inspired approach is used to express the dependence on x P and t. The resolved Pomeron (RP) model [17] is implemented in the RAPGAP event generator [19]. RAPGAP implements both a leading Pomeron (P) trajectory and a sub-leading 'Reggeon' (R). In this analysis the DPDF H1 2006 Fit B [2] is used, which employs the Owens pion PDFs [20] for the partonic content of the Reggeon. The Reggeon contribution is significant for x P > 0.01. Higher order QCD radiation is modelled by parton showers. Processes with a resolved virtual photon are also included, with the photon structure function given by the SaS-G 2D LO parameterisation [21].",

Assuming proton vertex factorisation, NLO QCD predictions for the diffractive partonic dijet cross section are calculated in bins of x P using the NLO-JET++ [35] program and integrated over the full x P range of the measurement. The renormalisation and factorisation scales are set to \u03bc r = \u03bc f = Q 2 + P * T 2 , where P * T is the mean of the transverse momenta of the two leading jets in the hadronic centre-of-mass frame. In order to estimate the uncertainties of the NLO QCD calculations due to missing higher orders, the factorisation scale \u03bc f and renormalisation scale \u03bc r are varied simultaneously by factors of 0.5 and 2. The average uncertainty arising from the variation of the scale is about 33 %. The DPDFs used in the NLO QCD calculations are H1 2006 Fit B [2] and H1 2007 Jets [3]. The H1 2007 Jets fit is based on the diffractive inclusive and dijet data while H1 2006 Fit B is based on inclusive diffractive data only. The uncertainty of the NLO QCD calculations due to DPDFs is estimated by propagating the DPDF errors. The DPDF errors are available only for the DPDF set H1 2006 Fit B. The average uncertainty resulting from the DPDF errors is about 7 % which is much smaller than the scale uncertainty. In the NLOJET++ calculations the strong coupling is set via \u039b (4) MS = 340 \u00b1 37 MeV for four flavours, which corresponds to the value of \u03b1 (5) s (M Z ) = 0.119 \u00b1 0.002 for five flavours in the 2-loop approximation [36,37]. The average uncertainty resulting from the variation of \u03b1 s (M Z ) is about 1.5 %.

A righthanded coordinate system is employed with the origin at the nominal interaction point, where the z-axis pointing in the proton beam or forward direction and the x(y) axis points in the horizontal (vertical) direction. The polar angle \u03b8 is measured with respect to the proton beam axis and the pseudorapidity is defined as \u03b7 = \u2212 ln tan(\u03b8/2). The Central Tracking Detector (CTD), with a polar angle coverage of 20 \u2022 < \u03b8 < 160 \u2022 , is used to reconstruct the interaction vertex and to measure the momenta of charged particles from the curvature of their trajectories in the 1.16 T field provided by a superconducting solenoid. Scattered electrons with polar angles in the range 154 \u2022 < \u03b8 e < 176 \u2022 are measured in a lead/scintillatingfibre calorimeter, the SpaCal [41]. The energy resolution is \u03c3 (E)/E \u2248 7 %/ \u221a E[GeV] \u2295 1 % as determined from the test beam measurement [42,43]. A Backward Proportional Chamber (BPC) in front of the SpaCal is used to measure the electron polar angle. The finely segmented Liquid Argon (LAr) sampling calorimeter surrounds the tracking system and covers the range in polar angle 4 \u2022 < \u03b8 < 154 \u2022 corresponding to a pseudorapidity range \u22121.5 < \u03b7 < 3.4. The LAr calorimeter consists of an electromagnetic section with lead as the absorber and a hadronic section with steel as the absorber. The total depth varies with \u03b8 between 4.5 and 8 interaction lengths. The energy resolution, determined from test beam measurements [42,43]",

The corresponding average uncertainties on the cross section measurements are 0.5 %, 5.3 % and 2.2 %. The dominant uncertainty originates from the FPS acceptance variation as a function of the leading proton transverse momentum in the horizontal projection. The above uncertainties result from the runby-run variations of the incoming proton beam angle and of the FPS detector positions relative to the proton beam, as well as from the imperfect knowledge of the HERA beam magnet optics. \u2022 The uncertainties of the measurements of the scattered electron energy E e (1 %) and angle \u03b8 e (1 mrad) on the SpaCal calorimeter lead to an average systematic uncertainty of the cross section of 1.5 % and 2.8 %, respectively. \u2022 The systematic uncertainty arising from the hadronic final state reconstruction is determined by varying the energy scale of the hadronic final state by \u00b12 % as obtained using a dedicated calibration [57]. The 2 % uncertainty of the calibration is confirmed by studies in the region of low jet transverse momenta and low photon virtuality. This source leads to an average uncertainty of the cross section measurements of 6.2 % for production of two central jets and 9.5 % for production of one central and one forward jet. \u2022 The model dependence of the acceptance and migration corrections is estimated by varying the shapes of the distributions in the kinematic variables P * T , \u03b7 * 2 , \u03b7 * f , x P , \u03b2 and Q 2 in the RAPGAP simulation within the constraints imposed on those distributions by the presented data. The \u03b7 * 2 and \u03b7 * f reweightings are varied within the errors of the parameters of the reweighting function, which amount up to a factor 4. The P * T distribution is reweighted by P * T \u00b10.15 , the x P distribution by (1/x P ) \u00b10.05 , the \u03b2 distribution by \u03b2 \u00b10.05 and (1 \u2212 \u03b2) \u22130.05 and the Q 2 distribution by log(Q 2 ) \u00b10.2 . For the 'two central jets' selection the largest uncertainty is introduced by the \u03b7 * 2 reweighting (4 %), followed by \u03b2 (2.7 %), while the reweights in x P , P * T and Q 2 result in an overall uncertainty of 2.3 %. The uncertainties for the 'one central + one forward jet' topology are 12.8 % for the \u03b7 * f reweighting, followed by P * T (2.1 %), while the reweights in x P , \u03b2 and Q 2 result in an overall uncertainty of 1.8 %.",

Within the uncertainties, the normalisation and shape of the cross sections are reasonably well described by the NLO QCD predictions. The NLO QCD predictions are shown with the hadronisation uncertainties and the scale uncertainties, which dominate over the DPDF uncertainties. Since dijet production is directly sensitive to the gluon DPDF, the measured cross sections confirm the normalisation and shape of the gluon DPDFs extracted from the NLO QCD fits to diffractive inclusive and dijet cross sections measured using the LRG method [2,3]. In Fig. 6 the differential cross sections are shown as a function of P * T ,1 and | \u03b7 * |. Within the errors, NLO QCD predictions describe the data. A slight deviation of the theory from the data is observed for jets with a small separation in pseudorapidity | \u03b7 * |.

For this comparison the reweighting with respect to the \u03b7 * 2 distribution specified in Sect. 5.2 is not applied to the RP model. Since the P and R fluxes which determine the x P dependence in the RP model has been tuned to the inclusive diffractive DIS LRG data [2] the good agreement in shape of the RP model with the dijet data supports the hypothesis of the proton vertex factorisation. Both the SCI+GAL and TGP models fail to describe the data. The SCI+GAL model predicts harder spectra in Q 2 and z P and a softer spectrum in log 10 (x P ) than are seen in the data. It should be noted that the probability of soft colour in-teractions and hence the normalisation of diffractive processes in the SCI+GAL model is adjusted to the measured dijet cross section. The TGP model is in agreement with the data only at low x P but underestimates the data significantly at larger x P sub-leading contributions are expected to be large.

In the BFKL approach [58][59][60], additional gluons can be emitted in the gap between the two jets, leading to a de-correlation in azimuthal angle | \u03c6 * |. The observed agreement between the measured cross sections and NLO DGLAP predictions in this distribution shows no evidence for such an effect in the kinematic region accessible in this analysis. Figure 13 presents the differential cross sections for the production of 'one central + one forward jet' as a function of the variables P * T , | \u03b7 * | and \u03b7 f . in the case of 'two central jets', The RP model is a factor of 2.2 below the data which is a larger discrepancy in normalisation than that observed in the 'two central jets' sample. A similar trend is seen for the LO QCD contributions in the two samples. The normalisation of the SCI+GAL model, tuned to 'two central jets', agrees with the cross section for 'one central + Fig. 11 The differential cross section for the production of one central and one forward jet shown as a function of the mean transverse momentum of two jets P * T , | \u03b7 * | and \u03b7 f .

NLO QCD predictions based on the DGLAP approach and using DPDFs extracted from inclusive diffraction measurements describe the dijet cross sections within the errors for both event topologies, supporting the universality of DPDFs. The measured t-slope of the dijet cross section is consistent within uncertainties with the value measured in inclusive diffractive DIS with a leading proton in the final state. This confirms the validity of the proton vertex factorisation hypothesis for dijet production in diffractive DIS.",

The SCI+GAL model is able to reproduce the normalisation of the cross section for both dijet topologies presented after tuning the model to the 'two central jets' data. The dependence of the diffractive dijet cross section on x P and z P is able to distinguish between the models.
