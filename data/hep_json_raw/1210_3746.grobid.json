            "text": "The study of the hadronic transitions between charmonium states has been an active field both for experimental and theoretical research. The decays \u03c8 \u2032 \u2192 \u03b7J/\u03c8 and \u03c0 0 J/\u03c8 were first observed thirty years ago, and improved measurements of the corresponding branching fractions were performed by the BESII [1] and CLEO [2] collaborations. These decays are important probes of \u03c8 \u2032 decay mechanisms that are characterized by the emission of a soft hadron. The QCD multipole-expansion (QCDME) technique was developed for applications to these heavy quarkonium system processes. For this, the measured branching fraction for \u03c8 \u2032 \u2192 \u03b7J/\u03c8 can be used to predict the \u03b7 transition rate between \u03a5 states [3].",

            "text": "Based on QCDME and the axial anomaly, the ratio is calculated to be R = 0.  [5]. Previously published measurements of this ratio give a significantly larger value of R = 0.040 \u00b1 0.004 [6]. Recently, using chiral-perturbation theory, the J\u00fclich group investigated the source of charmed-meson loops in these decays as a possible explanation for this discrepancy [7]. Under the assumption that the charmed-meson loop mechanism saturates the \u03c8 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c0 0 (\u03b7)J/\u03c8 decay widths, they obtained a value R = 0.11 \u00b1 0.06, which indicates that the charmed-meson loop mechanism can play an important role in explaining the data. With parameters introduced into the charmed-meson loop fixed using B(\u03c8 \u2032 \u2192 \u03b7J/\u03c8) as input, the hadron-loop contribution to the isospin violation decay \u03c8 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c0 0 J/\u03c8 can be evaluated [8,9]. Measurements of these branching fractions can provide experimental evidence for hadron-loop contributions in charmonim decays, and impose more stringent constraints on charmed-meson loop contributions. It will also help clarify the influence of long-distance effects in other charmonium decays, e.g. \u03c8(3770) \u2192 \u03c0 0 (\u03b7)J/\u03c8 [9,10], \u03c8 \u2032 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7 c , and [11]. This paper presents the most precise measurement of the ratio R and the related branching fractions for \u03c8 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c0 0 J/\u03c8 and \u03b7J/\u03c8.",

The nominal detector acceptance is 93% of 4\u03c0. The expected charged-particle momentum resolution and photon energy resolution are 0.5% and 2.5% at 1 GeV, respectively. The photon energy resolution at BESIII is much better than that of BESII and comparable to that achieved by CLEO [15] and the Crystal Ball [16].

For the further analysis, events are kept for which the reconstructed J/\u03c8 mass falls within a window of M ll \u2208 (3.05, 3.15) GeV/c 2 ; a mass window that is significantly larger than the mass resolution of about 8 MeV/c 2 . Figure 2 shows a Dalitz plot of the invariant-mass squared M 2 \u03b3 h J/\u03c8 for the reconstructed J/\u03c8 and the energetic photon versus the two-photon invariant-mass squared M 2 \u03b3 h \u03b3 , where \u03b3 h denotes the photon with the higher energy E \u03b3 h > E \u03b3 . Bands of \u03c0 0 , \u03b7, and \u03c7 cJ (J = 0, 1, 2) are clearly visible. To suppress the dominant source of background, which is from \u03c7 cJ decays, the mass of the \u03b3 h J/\u03c8 system is required to satisfy the condition M \u03b3 h J/\u03c8 / \u2208 (3.50, 3.57) GeV/c 2 and M \u03b3 h J/\u03c8 < 3.5 GeV/c 2 for \u03c8 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c0 0 J/\u03c8 and \u03b7J/\u03c8, respectively.

As shown in [7,27], the axial anomaly does not adequately explain the observed isospin violation, while contributions from charmed meson loops would be a possible mechanism for additional isospin violation sources. Confirmation of sizeable contributions from charmed-meson loops would be an indication that non-perturbative effects play an important role in the charmonium energy region.  ",

The observed line shapes are described with modified \u03c0 0 /\u03b7 line shapes plus backgrounds. The \u03c0 0 and \u03b7 line shapes are taken from MC simulation including detector resolution; the \u03c0 0 and \u03b7 are described with relativistic Breit-Wigners in the event generation, and their masses and widths are fixed at their nominal values[6]. To account for possible differences in mass resolution between data and MC simulation, the \u03c0 0 /\u03b7 line shapes [LS(\u03c0 0 /\u03b7)]are modified by convolution with a Gaussian function G(M \u03b3\u03b3 \u2212 \u03b4m, \u03c3). This technique of mass resolution smearing treatment was used in a previous publication[24]. The probability distribution function (PDF) for the signal is taken as LS(\u03c0 0 /\u03b7)\u2297G(M \u03b3\u03b3 \u2212 \u03b4m, \u03c3), where \u03b4m and \u03c3 correct the \u03c0 0 /\u03b7 mass and mass resolution, respectively. The PDF for the dominant background contribution is obtained from MC simulation and the residual background contribution is modeled as a first-order and a second-order polynomial function for the \u03c0 0 and \u03b7 channels, respectively. The polynomial coefficients are free parameters with values determined from the data. The fit results are shown inFig. 3. For \u03c8 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c0 0 J/\u03c8, the fit yields 1823\u00b149 events for the J/\u03c8 \u2192 e + e \u2212 sample with a goodness of fit of \u03c7 2 /ndf = 0.85, and 2268\u00b155 events for J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 with a \u03c7 2 /ndf = 0.86, where ndf denotes the number of degrees of freedom in the fit. For \u03c8 \u2032 \u2192 \u03b7J/\u03c8, the fit yields 29598\u00b1202 events for J/\u03c8 \u2192 e + e \u2212 with a \u03c7 2 /ndf = 1.33 and 38572\u00b1280 events for J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 with a \u03c7 2 /ndf = 0.96. The resulting values of \u03b4m and \u03c3 are |\u03b4m| < 1 MeV/c 2 and \u03c3 < 3 MeV/c 2 for all the modes.",
