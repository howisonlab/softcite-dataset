The corresponding \u039b/K 0 S and \u039e/\u039b ratios are presented as a function of transverse momentum. The hard scatterings are tagged by charged-particle jets ,which are reconstructed with the anti-k T algorithm using a resolution parameter R = 0.4. The flow-like correlations and the enhanced production of multi-strange hadrons in small colliding systems may be described by soft components.",

            "text": "The transverse momentum (p T ) dependence of the baryon-to-meson yield ratio in hadronic and nuclear collisions is sensitive to the collective expansion of the system, the partonic recombination into hadrons, the jet fragmentation and hadronization. The significant enhancement of such ratio has been observed at intermediate-p T (2 < p T < 6 GeV/c) in high multiplicity pp and p-Pb collision events with respect to lower multiplicity events [1]. However, the origin of the enhancement still remains an open question. There has been an investigation on V 0 s (K 0 S and \u039b) production in jets in p-Pb collisions at \u221a s NN = 5.02 TeV with ALICE [2]. In this contribution, we explore the connection between the baryon-to-meson ratio enhancement and jet production via the measurement of the p Tdifferential spectrum of strange and multi-strange particles (K 0 S , \u039b and \u039e) in pp collisions at \u221a s = 13 TeV, both inclusively and within energetic jets. The results set new constraints on the particle production mechanisms in jets, and provide new insight in the understanding of the origin of flowlike correlations observed in small colliding systems.",

The spectra in jets are harder than those from the underlying event.  The \u039b/K 0 S ratios in jets with p ch T,jet > 10 GeV/c and underlying events are presented in Fig. 4. We observe that the ratio in the underlying event is the same as the inclusive event ratio. The ratio in jets is significantly smaller than the ratio in UE (or inclusive event) at low and intermediate p T (2 < p T < 4 GeV/c).   Figure 5 shows the \u039e/\u039b (multi-strange particle to strange particle for \"baryons\") ratio in jets and underlying events. As observed for the \u039b/K 0 S ratio, the \u039e/\u039b ratio in the underlying event is the same as inclusive one and has a bump at intermediate p T . However, the ratio in jets is different with respect to the inclusive (or UE) ratio, and is not strongly dependent on p T .",

The enhancement of \u039b/K 0 S ratio is not present when the particles are within an energetic jet in pp collisions. The enhancement of baryon to meson ratio in high multiplicity events may be attributed to soft components of the collisions. The \u039e/\u039b ratio in jets is independent on p T . The enhanced production of multi-strange hadrons in high-multiplicity events [4] may also be explained by soft components of the collisions. ",
