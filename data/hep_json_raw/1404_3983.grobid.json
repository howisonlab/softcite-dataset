For this reason, measurements of electrons from heavy-flavour hadron decays have been performed in pp, p-Pb and Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC with the ALICE detector. Results for the nuclear modification factors (R pA and R AA ) support a final-state energy loss of heavy quarks in central Pb-Pb collisions and, in semi-central collisions a positive elliptic flow coefficient v 2 of electrons from heavy-flavour hadron decays was observed. Furthermore, a double-ridge structure was observed in the measured two-particle angular correlation distribution, triggered by heavy-flavour decay electrons, in high-multiplicity p-Pb collisions relative to low-multiplicity p-Pb collisions and to pp collisions.",

            "text": "The main purpose of study using relativistic heavy-ion collisions at the LHC is to investigate the properties of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). A good probe suited to study the QGP properties is heavy quarks, i. e. charm and beauty. These are produced in hard partonic scattering processes at the initial stage of the collision. Therefore, they work as self-generated probes of the medium created in these experiments. Heavy quarks lose energy while traversing the medium and, in case of sufficient re-scattering, they may even participate in the collective expansion of the medium. Proton-proton and p-Pb collisions serve as references for Pb-Pb collisions, since an extended QGP phase is not expected to be produced in these collision systems. Particularly, the comparison of measurements in p-Pb with those from Pb-Pb collisions allows the separation between cold nuclear matter (CNM) effects and those due to the presence of an extended, hot, and dense medium. Measurement of electrons from semi-leptonic decay of heavy-flavour hadrons is widely used to study heavy-flavour production in high-energy collisions. Measurements of the production cross section, the nuclear modification factors (R AA and R pA ) and the elliptic flow coefficient (v 2 ) of heavy-flavour decay electrons were performed with ALICE in pp, p-Pb and Pb-Pb collisions. Furthermore, the two-particle angular correlations triggered by electrons from heavy-flavour hadron decays were evaluated in pp and p-Pb collisions.",

            "text": "ALICE (A Large Ion Collider Experiment) is a detector system mainly dedicated to the study of Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC [1]. With ALICE, precise three-dimensional track reconstruction and vertex measurements are possible and particle species can be identified over a large momentum range. Electron identification is performed using information of the energy loss dE/dx in the Time-Projection-Chamber (TPC), the time-of-flight provided by the Time Of Flight (TOF) detector and the E/p ratio measured with the Electromagnetic Calorimeter (EMCal) [1,2]. Figure 1 (left panel), illustrates the electron selection using the TPC and the TOF detectors. The inclusive electron sample contains not only electrons from heavy-flavour hadron decays but also from various background sources, where the dominant contribution is from Dalitz decays of light mesons, mainly \u03c0 0 and \u03b7, and from photon conversions in the detector material. These contributions are statistically subtracted from the electron sample using the two methods described in the following. In the first method, contributions from electron-positron pairs from photon conversions or Dalitz decays were subtracted utilizing the fact that they have small invariant mass. The pair mass distribution is shown in the right panel of Fig. 1, where also the combinatorial background, which is estimated via like-sign pairs, is indicated. In the second method, called as cocktail method, the electron background from other sources is calculated using the measured light meson p T -differential cross section [2].   ",

The two-particle correlation distribution is the distribution of the difference in azimuth (\u2206\u03d5) and in pseudorapidity (\u2206\u03b7) between a trigger (t) and an associated (a) particle, normalized to the number of trigger particles.

The correlation distribution in low-multiplicity (60-100%) p-Pb collisions is similar to that obtained in pp collisions. However, a modification of the correlation function, on the near (\u2212 \u03c0 2 < \u2206\u03d5 < \u03c0 2 ) and away ( \u03c0 2 < \u2206\u03d5 < 3\u03c0 2 ) side is visible for electrons at low pT in high-multiplicity p-Pb collisions with respect to pp and low-multiplicity p-Pb collisions.

In order to quantify the change of the correlation distribution in the (\u2206\u03d5,\u2206\u03b7) space, the correlation distribution in low-multiplicity p-Pb collisions was subtracted from the one in high-multiplicity collisions. In Figure 4 (left panel) the result of the subtraction is shown in the (\u2206\u03b7,\u2206\u03d5) space. The double ridge structure displayed in the left panel of Figure 4 indicates that the observed modification in the correlation function is mainly due to correlations of long range in pseudorapidity. This is qualitatively similar to what was observed for di-hadron correlation [6]. In that case, the observed double-ridge structure can be described by hydrodynamic model calculations assuming an extended system in the final state, as well as by colour glass condensate (CGC) model calculations, through which gluon saturation in the initial state is represented.
