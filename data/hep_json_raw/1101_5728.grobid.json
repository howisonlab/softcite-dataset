            "text": "A four-generation model [2] could provide a source of particle-antiparticle asymmetry large enough to account for the baryon asymmetry of the universe [3], and accomodate a heavier Higgs boson (the source of mass generation) than a three-generation model [4]. Direct searches for production of chiral fourth generation quarks restrict their masses to be greater than 335 GeV/c 2 [5] for an uptype quark t \u2032 decaying via t \u2032 \u2192 W q and 338 GeV/c 2 [6] for a down-type quark b \u2032 decaying via b \u2032 \u2192 tW . This Letter reports a search for pair-production via strong interactions of a heavy chiral [7] bottom-like quark, b \u2032 , followed by prompt decay to a t quark and a W boson with branching ratio B(b \u2032 \u2192 W t) = 100%. The assumption that b \u2032 decays exclusively to tW is reasonable if the coupling to light quarks is small, as expected from precision meson-mixing measurements [8], and in the hypothesis that m b \u2032 > m t + m W . In the case that the branching fraction deviates from 100%, the limits can be interpreted under different assumptions [9]. Previous searches considered the mode in which two same-charge W bosons decayed leptonically [6], which gives a lowbackground signature but a low selection efficiency due to the small W \u2192 \u2113\u03bd branching ratio. We consider the mode",

A chargedparticle tracking system immersed in a 1.4 T magnetic field consists of a silicon microstrip tracker and a drift chamber. Electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters surround the tracking system and measure particle energies. Drift chambers located outside the calorimeters detect muons. We use a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 4.8\u00b10.3 fb \u22121 . The data acquisition system is triggered by e or \u00b5 candidates [12] with transverse momentum p T [11] greater than 18 GeV/c. Electrons and muons are reconstructed offline and selected if they have absolute value of pseudorapidity \u03b7 [11] less than 1.1, p T \u2265 20 GeV/c and satisfy the standard CDF identification and isolation requirements [12]. Jets are reconstructed in the calorimeter using the jetclu [13] algorithm with a clustering radius of 0.4 in azimuth-pseudorapidity space and corrected using the standard techniques [14]. Jets are selected if they have p T \u2265 15 GeV/c and |\u03b7| < 2.4. Each jet is considered for heavy-flavor tagging using the default CDF b-jet identification algorithm (secvtx [15]) that searches in the jet for a secondary vertex which results from the displaced decay of a B-hadron inside the jet. Missing transverse momentum [16] is reconstructed using fully corrected calorimeter and muon information [12].",

The dominant systematic uncertainties are the jet energy scale [14], contributions from multiple interaction in the same bunch crossing, and descriptions of initial and final state radiation [23]. The impact on the cross-section upper limits of the uncertainty due to each source was estimated by varying it according to the amount of its uncertainty and observing the resulting effects on the S Njet T spectrum. Each uncertainty weakens the expected 95% confidence level (C.L.) cross section upper limit by \u2248 60% individually. Additional uncertainty comes from parton distribution functions (PDF) [24,25], the matching scale used between the matrix-element and the parton shower, overall background normalization, and uncertainties in performance of the b-quark identification algorithm.

However, the total number of events observed in the low S T and high S T regions combined is consistent with expectation.
