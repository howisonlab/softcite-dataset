            "text": "The scattering of two photons is a well-known quantum process which exhibits the non-linear nature of quantized electromagnetic fields. Although light-by-light scattering was predicted almost 100 years ago its direct experimentally observation still remains to be discovered.Until today, several ways of directly detected this phenomenon in the laboratory have been proposed. For example, Compton-backscattered photons against laser photons [1], collisions of photons from microwave waveguides [2] or high-power lasers [3,4,5], and at photon colliders [6,7,8]. In [9] using computer simulations, the authors show that lead-lead collisions provide the opportunity for seeing a scattering of quasireal photons in the LHC. Direct observation of photon-photon scattering is worth the effort because of any deviation from the predicted could be evidence of new physics, e.g., the existence of supersymmetry. In this paper, we discuss the possibilities of conducting experimental research in the field of fundamental physics based on the E-XFEL.",

A high-energy photon beam, generated via the gamma-ray source is fired into a vacuum channel where it intersects with the E-XFEL's x-ray photon beam.

The vacuum channel is surrounded by multi-layer charged particle detectors for detecting elector-positron pairs. The detectors are protected from external radiation and cosmic rays. One of the central problems of this proposal is the gamma-ray source. In the work [8], it is  Comparison of gamma photon sources according to data from [10].

Electrons and positrons emitted from the back surface of a gold target deviate from the interaction region using a magnetic field. Another way is proposed in a recent paper [10]. Electromagnetic dipole cascades can become one of the possible sources of gamma. The paper demonstrated the possibility of creating a stable directional source of photons of GeV energies. Using 3D QED particle-in-cell modeling and analytical evaluations, the authors show that it is possible to attain a peak power of 10 PW. When this becomes possible, there will be a real possibility to carry out this kind of experiments. Fig. 2 shows the approximate location of possible gamma-ray sources on a brilliance-energy map.",

The observed gammaray spectrum of them contains information about physical conditions and composition of matter in the Universe at various stages of its evolution. In this case, it is very important to take into account the factors leading to spectral distortions as absorbtion due to the interaction with background photons. The process of absorption of gamma rays with the production of electronpositron pairs in the collision of them with cosmological background photons [13] makes the most important contribution to distortion of spectrum in the gamma-ray range. For gamma quanta with energies E \u223c 100 GeV \u00f7 100 TeV, this is mainly interaction with clusters of galaxies, which are the largest gravitationally bound objects in the Universe.

This experiment can be considered both as a test of the standard model and as a simulation of astrophysical processes. It is a good possibility to research the absorption of gamma radiation in the laboratory. However, the implementation of the experiment described in this article is a task with many problems: (i) The real source of gamma-ray. (ii) The photon interaction geometry. (iii) Special aspects of the interaction of photons with coherent E-XFEL's radiation.",
