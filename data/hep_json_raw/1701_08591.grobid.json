With a nearly background free sample of about 16000 events, we investigate the substructure of the decay and determine the relative fractions and the phases among the different intermediate processes. Our amplitude model includes the two-body decays D 0 \u2192K * 0 \u03c1 0 , D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 a + 1 (1260) and D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 1 (1270)\u03c0 + , the three-body decays D 0 \u2192K * 0 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c1 0 , as well as the four-body non-resonant decay D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 . The dominant intermediate process is D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 a + 1 (1260), accounting for a fit fraction of 54.6%.",

            "text": "The decay D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 is one of the three golden decay modes of the neutral D meson (the other two are D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + and D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 0 ). Due to a large branching fraction and low background it is well suited to used as a reference channel for other decays of the D 0 meson [1]. An accurate knowledge of its resonant substructure and the relative amplitudes and phases are important to reduce systematic uncertainties in analyses that use this channel for reference. In particular, the lack of knowledge of the substructure leads to one of the largest systematic uncertainties in the measurement of the absolute branching fractions of the D hadronic decays [2]. The knowledge of the decay substructure in combination with a precise measurement of strong phases can also help to improve the measurement of the CKM angle \u03b3 [3]. In the measurement of \u03b3, the parameterization model is an important input information in a model dependent method and also can be used to generate Monte Carlo (MC) to check the sensitivity in a model independent method [4]. Furthermore, the branching fractions of intermediate processes can be used to understand the D 0 \u2212D 0 mixing in theory [5,6].",

Both measurements are affected by low statistics. Using about 1300 signal events, Mark III obtained the branching fractions for D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 a + 1 (1260), D 0 \u2192K * 0 \u03c1 0 , D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 1 (1270)\u03c0 + , as well as for the three-and four-body non-resonant decays. Based on 1745 signal events and 800 background events, E691 obtained a similar result but without considering the D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 1 (1270)\u03c0 + decay mode. The results from Mark III and E691 have large uncertainties. Therefore, further experimental study of D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decay is of great importance for improving the precision of future measurements.",

We perform an amplitude analysis of the decay D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 (the inclusion of charge conjugate reactions is implied) to study the resonant substructure in this decay. The \u03c8(3770) decays into a D 0D0 pair without any additional hadrons. We employ a double-tag method to measure the branching fraction. In order to suppress the backgrounds from other charmed meson decays and continuum (QED and qq) processes, only the decay modeD 0 \u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212 is used to tag the D 0D0 pair. A detailed discussion of background can be found in Sec. III. The amplitude model is constructed using the covariant tensor formalism [11].",

            "text": "The BESIII detector is described in detail in Ref. [12]. The geometrical acceptance of the BESIII detector is 93% of the full solid angle. Starting from the interaction point (IP), it consists of a main drift chamber (MDC), a time-of-flight (TOF) system, a CsI(Tl) electromagnetic calorimeter (EMC) and a muon system (MUC) with layers of resistive plate chambers (RPC) in the iron return yoke of a 1.0 T superconducting solenoid. The momentum resolution for charged tracks in the MDC is 0.5% at a transverse momentum of 1 GeV/c. Monte Carlo (MC) simulations are based on GEANT4 [13]. The production of \u03c8(3770) is simulated with the KKMC [14] package, taking into account the beam energy spread and initial-state radiation (ISR). The PHOTOS [15] package is used to simulate the finalstate radiation (FSR) of charged tracks. The MC samples, which consist of \u03c8(3770) decays to DD, non-DD, ISR production of low mass charmonium states and continuum processes, are referred to as \"generic MC\". The EvtGen [16] package is used to simulate the known decay modes with branching fractions taken from the Particle Data Group (PDG) [1], and the remaining unknown decays are generated with the LundCharm model [17]. The effective luminosities of the generic MC samples correspond to at least five times the data sample luminosity. They are used to investigate possible backgrounds. The decay D 0 \u2192 K 0 S (\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 )K \u2212 \u03c0 + has the same final state as signal and is investigated using a dedicated MC sample with the decay chain of \u03c8(3770) \u2192 D 0D0 with D 0 \u2192 K 0 S K \u2212 \u03c0 + andD 0 \u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212 , referred to as \"K 0 S K\u03c0 MC\". The decay model of D 0 \u2192 K 0 S K \u2212 \u03c0 + is generated according to CLEO's results [18]. In amplitude analysis, two sets of signal MC samples using different decay models are generated. One sample is generated with an uniform distribution in phase space for the D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decay, which is used in calculate the MC integrations and called \"PHSP MC\". The other sample is generated according to the results obtained in this analysis for the D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decay. It is used to check the fit performance, calculate the goodness of fit and estimate the detector efficiency, and is called the \"SIGNAL MC\".",

In the \u03c0 + \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 invariant mass spectrum, a broad bump appears. We find this bump can be fitted as a + 1 (1260), which was also observed by the Mark III [7] experiment.

The dominant components, D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 a + 1 (1260), D 0 \u2192K * 0 \u03c1 0 , D 0 \u2192 four-body non-resonant decay and three-body non-resonant D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c1 0 improve upon the earlier results from Mark III and are consistent with them within corresponding uncertainties. The resonance K \u2212 1 (1270) observed by Mark III is also confirmed in this analysis. The detailed results are listed in Table V. About 40% of components comes from the nonresonant four-body (D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) and three-body (D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c1 0 and D 0 \u2192K * 0 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) decays.
