The efficiency of identifying top quarks is measured using a sample of top-quark pairs and the rate of wrongly identifying jets from other quarks or gluons as top quarks is measured using multijet events collected with the ATLAS experiment in 20.3 fb \u22121 of 8 TeV proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider. Predictions from Monte Carlo simulations are found to provide an accurate description of the performance. The techniques are compared in terms of signal efficiency and background rejection using simulations, covering a larger range in jet transverse momenta than accessible in the dataset. Additionally, a novel technique is developed that is optimized to reconstruct top quarks in events with many jets.",

Hadronic top-quark decays are reconstructed by taking those jets which, when combined, best fit the kinematic properties of the top-quark decay, such as the top-quark mass and the W -boson mass. These kinematic constraints may also be fulfilled for a collection of jets which do not all originate from the same top-quark decay chain.",

These differences in the jet substructure can be better resolved after contributions from soft gluon radiation or from additional pp interactions in the same or adjacent bunch crossings (pile-up) are removed from the jets. Such methods are referred to as jet grooming and consist of either an adaptive modification of the jet algorithm or a selective removal of soft radiation during the process of iterative recombination in jet reconstruction [14][15][16].",

Top tagging based on the combination of jet-substructure variables, Shower Deconstruction [19,20], 1 The ATLAS experiment uses a right-handed coordinate system with its origin at the nominal interaction point (IP) in the centre of the detector and the z-axis along the beam line. The x-axis points from the IP to the centre of the LHC ring, and the y-axis points upwards. Cylindrical coordinates (r, \u03c6) are used in the transverse plane, \u03c6 being the azimuthal angle around the beam line. Observables labelled \"transverse\" are projected into the x-y plane. The pseudorapidity is defined in terms of the polar angle \u03b8 as \u03b7 = \u2212 ln tan \u03b8/2. The transverse momentum is defined as pT = p sin \u03b8 = p/ cosh \u03b7, and the transverse energy ET has an analogous definition. The distance in \u03b7-\u03c6 space is referred to as \u2206R = p (\u2206\u03b7) 2 + (\u2206\u03c6) 2 .

According to simulation, which describes the measured distribution within uncertainties, the top-quark purity in the region near the top-quark mass is very high, with the largest contribution being matched tt. The peak at the position of the W -boson mass originates from hadronically decaying top quarks where the b-jet from the decay is not contained in the large-R jet. Even smaller masses are obtained if one of the decay products of the hadronically decaying W boson is not contained in the large-R jet or if only one top-quarkdecay product is captured in the large-R jet. In these cases, a small mass is obtained due to the kinematic requirements imposed during trimming. The fraction of not-matched tt increases for decreasing large-R jet mass indicating a decreasing fraction of jets with a close-by hadronically decaying top quark.

Only the nine hardest subjets of the large-R jet are used in the present study to reduce the processing time per event, which grows with the number of subjets considered in the calculation. The signal weight is zero for large-R jets with fewer than three subjets because a finite signal weight requires the existence of at least three subjets which are identified with the three partons from the top-quark decay. To speed up the computation of the signal weights, the signal weight is set to zero if no combination of at least three subjets can be found that has an invariant mass within a certain range around the top-quark mass.

The p T (figure 9(a)) and the mass (figure 9(b)) are shown for the trimmed version of the anti-k t R = 1.0 jet. The p T spectrum is smoothly falling and the mass spectrum is peaked at m t . Both distributions are described by the simulation within the uncertainties. The uncertainty of the simulation for p T < 400 GeV is dominated by the uncertainties in the subjet energy scale and on the PDF. From 400 to 500 GeV, important contributions come from the PDF, ISR/FSR, the large-R JES, and the parton shower. Between 500 and 550 GeV, the large-R JES gives the largest contribution. For p T > 550 GeV, the dominant uncertainties are the ones on the PDF and the large-R JES. For masses below 160 GeV, the uncertainty is dominated by the uncertainties in the subjet energy scale and resolution. For masses greater than 210 GeV, the differences between the generators and the PDF uncertainty dominate, consistent with previous figures, where the large-R jet mass distribution receives significant contributions from the generator uncertainty for high mass values. In the mass region 160-210 GeV, multiple sources contribute significantly to the uncertainty.",

The procedure stops when all substructure objects have a mass below the value m cut . In the second phase, all combinations of three substructure objects are tested for kinematic compatibility with a hadronic top-quark decay. Energy contributions from underlying event and pile-up are removed using a filtering procedure: small distance parameter C/A jets are built from the constituents of the substructure objects using a radius parameter that depends on the distance between these objects but has at most the value R max filt . The constituents of the N filt highest-p T jets found in this way (filter jets) are then clustered into three top-quark subjets using the exclusive C/A algorithm. In the final step, kinematic requirements are applied to differentiate hadronic top-quark decays from background. One of the criteria is that one pair of subjets must have an invariant mass in the range 80.4 GeV \u00d7 (1 \u00b1 f W ) around the W -boson mass, with f W being a parameter of the algorithm. If all criteria are met, the top-quark candidate is built by adding the four-momenta of the N filt highest-p T filter jets. The large-R jet is considered to be tagged if the top-quark-candidate mass is between 140 and 210 GeV and the top-quark-candidate p T is larger than 200 GeV.

The purity of processes with top quarks (tt and single-top production) in this sample is more than 99%. The variable m 12 (m 23 ) is the invariant mass of the highest-p T (second-highest-p T ) and the second-highest-p T (thirdhighest-p T ) subjet found in the final, i.e. exclusive, subjet clustering step. The variable m 13 is defined analogously, and the variable m 123 is the mass of the three exclusive subjets. The ratio m 23 /m 123 is used internally in the HEPTopTagger algorithm and is displayed in figure 10(a). It shows a peak at m W /m t , which indicates that in most of the cases, the highest-p T subjet corresponds to the b-quark. The inverse tangent of the ratio m 13 /m 12 is also used internally in the HEPTopTagger algorithm and its distribution is shown in figure 10(b). The HEPTopTagger top-quark-candidate p T (figure 10(c)) is peaked at \u2248 250 GeV and falls smoothly at higher p T . At around 200 GeV, the tagging efficiency JHEP06(2016)093 increases strongly with p T (cf. section 8.1) and therefore there are fewer entries in the lowest p T interval from 200 to 250 GeV than would be expected from a falling p T distribution. The HEPTopTagger top-quark-candidate mass (figure 10(d)) is peaked near the top-quark mass with tails to lower and higher values.

Uncertainties in the following quantities are estimated in this way: the energy scale of the large-R jets; the k t splitting scales, the N-subjettiness ratios, and the mass of trimmed anti-k t R = 1.0 jets; the subjet energy scale for SD. For p T < 900 GeV of trimmed anti-k t R = 1.0 jets, the uncertainty is not derived from the track-jet method, but using \u03b3+jet events and an additional uncertainty based on the difference between the calorimeter's response to QCD jets and jets from tt decays. The uncertainties in the k t splitting scales, the N-subjettiness ratios and the trimmed mass are 4-7% for p T between 350 and 700 GeV, depending on the jet p T , \u03b7 and the ratio m/p T . For values of m/p T < 0.1, the uncertainties are larger and reach values of up to 10%. The subjet energy-scale uncertainty for the HEPTopTagger is determined in situ from the reconstructed top-quark mass peak as described in section 6.2. The correlations between the uncertainties in the substructure variables used by taggers I-V and the W \u2032 top tagger have not been determined; the largest observed variations are used based on testing different combinations of zero and full (anti-)correlation of the systematic uncertainties of the different substructure variables.",

With this change, the \u00b5+jets channel alone provides sufficient events to perform this study. The fourmomentum of the top-quark candidate is obtained in the HEPTopTagger by combining the calibrated subjet four-momenta. A change in the subjet p T is therefore reflected in a change of the top-quark-candidate momentum. The top-quark peak in the distribution of the topquark-candidate mass can be used to constrain the energy-scale uncertainty of the subjets as suggested in ref. [96]. The method consists of varying the energy scale of the calibrated subjets in simulation and comparing the resulting top-quark mass distribution to the one from data. A higher (lower) subjet energy scale shifts the predicted distribution to larger (smaller) masses.

The simulation is shown for the nominal energy scale and, as an example, for the case of the variation with f = k 2 /p T with k 2 = 1 GeV. For subjets with p T = 100 GeV, this corresponds to a relative change of the transverse momentum of \u00b11%. The description of the measured distribution is improved by the +1% variation. The level of agreement between the measured and predicted distributions is quantified in terms of the \u03c7 2 value shown in figure 12(b) for different values of k 2 . The variation is expressed as the relative p T change for subjets with p T = 100 GeV (JES shift). A parabola is fitted to the \u03c7 2 values as a function of the JES shift. The best agreement is obtained for a JES shift of +1%, which leads to the smallest \u03c7 2 , \u03c7 2 min . This result can be used to correct the subjet p T scale in the simulation. This is left to future studies. Here, an uncertainty in the p T scale is determined as follows.

Multijets typically pose the largest background in tt analyses in the fully hadronic channel.

Also, in the kinematic region considered in the comparison presented here, it was shown for the HEPTopTagger that the mistag rate is similar for multijet background and background from W \u2192 q \u2032q [18].

The efficiency at which the rejection of a cut on \u221a d 23 is higher than the rejection for the trimmed-mass cut depends on p true T : it is \u2248 45% for 350 < p true T < 400 GeV and increases to 90% for 1000 < p true T < 1500 GeV. A cut on the trimmed mass performs similarly to the \u221a d 12 cut. A cut on \u03c4 32 performs significantly worse. For high efficiencies and the ranges of lower p true T (e.g. \u2248 60-90% for 350 < p true T < 400 GeV), the cut on the trimmed mass shows only a small increase in the rejection with decreasing signal efficiency. For lower efficiencies, the rejection increases more strongly with decreasing signal efficiency. This is due to the two distinct W -boson and top-quark mass peaks in signal, as exemplified in figure 1(a) . A combination of N-subjettiness and splitting-scale information, as used in the W \u2032 top tagger, gives the best performance of all studied substructure-variable-based approaches for efficiencies below a certain threshold efficiency. This threshold efficiency is \u2248 40% for 350 < p true T < 400 GeV and it increases to \u2248 80% for 1000 < p true T < 1500 GeV.

For higher p T , the efficiency rises up to 70%. The maximum efficiency is determined by the requirement of having at least three subjets which combine to an invariant mass near the top-quark mass and a subset of these subjets to give a mass near the W -boson mass. The increase of the maximum efficiency from approximately 50% at 350-400 GeV to approximately 70% at 550-1000 GeV is a result of the larger average containment of the top-quark decay products in the large-R jet at higher p T . At the highest p T values (1000-1500 GeV), the use of R = 0.2 subjets limits the efficiency as the top-quark decay products cannot be fully resolved for an increasing fraction of large-R jets, resulting in a maximum efficiency of \u2248 50%.",

The events are selected according to the criteria described in section 4.2.1, except that all requirements related to large-R jets are not applied in the case of HEPTopTagger04. For these efficiencies, a top quark is considered tagged if a top-quark candidate is reconstructed with a momentum direction within \u2206R = 1.0 of the top-quark momentum direction. The definition of the efficiency is therefore different from the large-R-jet-based one used in section 7.1, where also a different event selection and different matching criteria are applied. The efficiency of the HEPTopTagger04 method increases with the p T of the top quark and reaches values of \u2248 50% for p T > 500 GeV. The efficiency of the HEPTopTagger04 method is lower than the efficiency of the HEPTopTagger, but follows the trend of the HEPTopTagger efficiency closely. The HEPTopTagger efficiency reaches higher values than in section 7.1 primarily because the event selection here requires two b-tagged jets. This efficiency, however, does not take into account the specific needs of event reconstruction in final states with top quarks and many additional jets, for which the HEPTop-Tagger04 was designed. An example of such a topology in an extension of the SM is the associated production of a top quark and a charged Higgs boson, H + , decaying to tb, i.e. pp \u2192 H +t (b) \u2192 tbt(b). After the decay of the top quarks, the final state contains three or four b-quarks.

This approach, however, is not straightforward because of the different jet algorithms and jet radii used for HEPTopTagger subjets and b-tagging.

Jets with a large radius parameter R are reconstructed and their substructure is analysed using a range of techniques that are sensitive to differences between hadronic top-quark decay and background processes. Jets are tagged as top jets by requirements imposed on the jet mass, splitting scales, and N-subjettiness, and by using the more elaborated algorithms of Shower Deconstruction (SD) and the original (not multivariate) HEPTopTagger. Six different combinations of requirements on substructure variables are investigated, five combinations denoted by taggers I-V and the W \u2032 top tagger. For these taggers and for Shower Deconstruction, trimmed anti-k t R = 1.0 jets with p T > 350 GeV are used. Cambridge/Aachen (C/A) R = 0.2 subjets with p T > 20 GeV are used for SD. The HEP-TopTagger was designed for, and is used with, ungroomed C/A R = 1.5 jets down to jet transverse momenta of 200 GeV.
