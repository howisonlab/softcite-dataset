For a Higgs boson with a mass of 125 GeV, assuming the Standard Model production cross section, an upper bound of 0.28 is set on the branching fraction of H \u2192 invisible at 95% confidence level, where the expected upper limit is 0.31. The results are interpreted in models of Higgsportal dark matter where the branching fraction limit is converted into upper bounds on the dark-matter-nucleon scattering cross section as a function of the dark-matter particle mass, and compared to results from the direct dark-matter detection experiments.",

Dark matter (DM) may be explained by the existence of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMP) [2,3]. The observed Higgs boson with a mass of about 125 GeV [4,5] might decay to dark matter or neutral long-lived massive particles [6][7][8][9][10], provided this decay is kinematically allowed. This is referred to as an invisible decay of the Higgs boson [11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18].",

In addition to the VBF Higgs boson signal itself, there is a contribution to Higgs boson production from the gluon fusion plus 2-jets (ggF+2-jets) process, which is smaller than the VBF signal in the phase space of interest in this search. The ggF+2-jets contribution is treated as signal. The search is performed with a dataset corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb \u22121 of proton-proton collisions at \u221a s = 8 TeV, recorded by the ATLAS detector at the LHC [21].",

At small radii from the beamline, the inner detector, immersed in a 2 T magnetic field produced by a thin superconducting solenoid located directly inside the calorimeter, is made up of fine-granularity pixel and microstrip silicon detectors covering the range |\u03b7| < 2.5, and a gas-filled straw-tube transition-radiation tracker (TRT) in the range |\u03b7| < 2. The TRT complements the silicon tracker at larger radii and also provides electron identification based on transition radiation. The electromagnetic (EM) calorimeter is a lead/liquid-argon sampling calorimeter with an accordion geometry. The EM calorimeter is divided into a barrel section covering |\u03b7| < 1.475 and two end-cap sections covering 1.375 < |\u03b7| < 3.2. For |\u03b7| < 2.5 it is divided into three layers in depth, which are finely segmented in \u03b7 and \u03c6. An additional thin presampler layer, covering |\u03b7| < 1.8, is used to correct for fluctuations in energy losses between the production vertex and the calorimeter. Hadronic calorimetry in the region |\u03b7| < 1.7 uses steel absorbers, and scintillator tiles as the active medium. Liquidargon calorimetry with copper absorbers is used in the hadronic end-cap calorimeters, which cover the region 1.5 < |\u03b7| < 3.2. A forward calorimeter using copper or tungsten absorbers with liquid argon completes the calorimeter coverage up to |\u03b7| = 4.9. The muon spectrometer (MS) measures the curvature of muon trajectories with |\u03b7| < 2.7, using three stations of precision drift tubes, with cathode strip chambers in the innermost layer for |\u03b7| > 2.0. The deflection is provided by a toroidal magnetic field with an integral of approximately 3 Tm and 6 Tm in the central and end-cap regions of the ATLAS detector, respectively. The MS is also instrumented with dedicated trigger chambers, namely resistive-plate chambers in the barrel and thin-gap chambers in the end-cap, covering |\u03b7| < 2.4.",

The results based on the fast simulation are validated against fully simulated samples and the difference is found to be negligible. The simulated events are reconstructed with the same software as the data. Additional pp collisions in The W (\u2192 \u03bd)+jets and Z(\u2192 )+jets processes are generated using Sherpa-1.4.5 [61] including leading-order (LO) matrix elements for up to five partons in the final state with CT10 PDFs and matching these matrix elements with the parton shower following the procedure in ref. [62]. The W (\u2192 \u03bd)+jets and Z(\u2192 )+jets processes are divided into two components based on the number of electroweak vertices in the Feynman diagrams. Diagrams which have only two electroweak vertices contain jets that are produced via the strong interaction, and are labelled \"QCD\" Z+jets or W +jets. Diagrams which have four electroweak vertices contain jets that are produced via the electroweak interaction, and are labelled \"EW\" Z+jets or W +jets [63]. The MC predictions of the QCD components of W +jets and Z+jets are normalized to NNLO in FEWZ [64,65], while the EW components are normalized to VBFNLO [66], including the jet p T and dijet invariant mass requirements. The interference between the QCD and EW components of Z+jets and W +jets is evaluated with Sherpa-1.4.5 to be 7.5-18.0% of the size of the EW contribution depending on the signal regions. To account for this interference effect, the EW contribution is corrected with the estimated size of the interference term. Figure 1 shows Feynman diagrams for the signal and example vector-boson backgrounds. There are additional small backgrounds from tt, single top, diboson and multijet production. The tt process is modelled using Powheg-Box, with Pythia-8.165 modelling the parton shower, hadronization and underlying event. Single-top production samples are generated with MC@NLO [67] for the s-and W t-channel [68], while AcerMC-v3.8 [69] is used for singletop production in the t-channel. A top-quark mass of 172.5 GeV is used consistently. The AUET2C (AUET2B) [70] set of optimized parameters for the underlying event description is used for tt (single-top) processes, with CT10 (CTEQ6L1) [71] PDFs. Diboson samples W W , W Z and ZZ (with leptonic decays) are normalized at NLO and generated using Herwig-6.5.20 [72] with CT10 PDFs, including the parton shower and hadronization, and Jimmy [73] to model the underlying event, whereas the W W , W Z, and ZZ (\u2192 qq, \u03bd\u03bdqq) processes are generated together with EW W +jets and Z+jets samples. Diboson W W , W Z and ZZ (\u2192 qq, \u03bd\u03bdqq) samples generated using Sherpa-1.4.5 with CT10 PDFs and normalized to NLO in QCD [74] are used as a cross-check.

In the final level, calibrated clusters of cell energies in the calorimeter [75] are used. At each level, an increasingly stringent threshold is applied. The most stringent requirement is E miss T >= 80 GeV.

They are distinguished primarily by the selection requirements on the invariant mass m jj of the two highest-p T jets and their separation in pseudorapidity \u2206\u03b7 jj as shown in table 1. The SR1 selection requires events to have two jets: one with p T > 75 GeV and one with p T > 50 GeV. The E miss T is constructed as the negative vectorial sum of the transverse momenta of all calibrated objects (identified electrons, muons, photons, hadronic decays of \u03c4 -leptons, and jets) and an additional term for transverse energy in the calorimeter not included in any of these objects [87]. Events must have E miss T > 150 GeV in order to suppress the background from multijet events. To further suppress the multijet background, the two leading jets are required to have an azimuthal opening angle |\u2206\u03c6 jj | < 2.5 radians and an azimuthal opening angle with respect to the E miss T of |\u2206\u03c6 j,E miss T | > 1.6 radians for the leading jet and |\u2206\u03c6 j,E miss T | > 1 radian otherwise. In the VBF process, the forward jets tend to have large separations in pseudorapidity (\u2206\u03b7 jj ), with correspondingly large dijet masses, and little hadronic activity between the two jets. To focus on the VBF production, the leading jets are required to be well-separated in pseudorapidity |\u2206\u03b7 jj | > 4.8, and have an invariant mass m jj > 1 TeV. Events are rejected if any jet is identified as arising from the decay of a b-quark or a \u03c4 -lepton. The rejection of events with b-quarks suppresses top-quark backgrounds. Similarly, rejection of events with a \u03c4 -lepton suppresses the W (\u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd)+jets background. Further, events are vetoed if they contain any reconstructed leptons passing the transverse momentum thresholds p e T > 10 GeV for electrons, p \u00b5 T > 5 GeV for muons, or p \u03c4 T > 20 GeV for \u03c4 -leptons. Finally, events with a third jet having p T > 30 GeV and |\u03b7| < 4.5 are rejected. The SR2 selections are motivated by a search for new phenomena in final states with an energetic jet and large missing transverse momentum [25], and differ from those of SR1. First, the leading jet 4 is required to have p T > 120 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.5. 4 The \"charge fraction\" of this jet is defined as the ratio of the \u03a3pT of tracks associated to the jet to the -6 -",

To account for the \u2206\u03c6 j,E miss T requirement itself, the \u2206\u03c6 jj requirement is inverted, requiring back-to-back jets in \u03c6. This sample is also multijet-dominated. Combining all the efficiencies with the observed control region yield gives an estimate of 2 \u00b1 2 events for the multijet background in SR1.",

In the control sample corresponding to the SR1 selection, the leading lepton is required to have p T > 30 GeV. Triggers requiring a single electron or muon with p T > 24 GeV are used to select the control samples in SR1; in SR2, either a single-electron or E miss T trigger is used. The inefficiency of the triggers with respect to the offline requirements is negligible. In order to emulate the effect of the offline missing transverse momentum selection used in the signal region, the E miss T quantity is corrected by vectorially adding the electron (SR1 and SR2) and muon transverse momenta (SR1 only). All the Z(\u2192 ee/\u00b5\u00b5)+jets events are then required to pass the other signal region selections. Backgrounds from processes other than Z(\u2192 ee/\u00b5\u00b5)+jets are small in these control regions; the contributions from non-Z backgrounds are estimated from MC simulation. For Z \u2192 ee (Z \u2192 \u00b5\u00b5), the non-Z background is at a level of 1.6% (0.9%) of the sample. There is 50% uncertainty (mainly due to the limited numbers of MC events) on the non-Z background contamination in the Z control regions. The observed yield in the SR1 Z control region, shown in table 2, is larger than the expected yield by 16% but is compatible within the combined statistical uncertainties of MC simulation and data. In the SR2 control regions, the observed and expected yields differ by 10% as shown in table 3 but are compatible within the total statistical and systematic uncertainties (see section 6). The emulated E miss T distributions for the Z control regions are shown in figures 2 and 3 for SR1 and SR2 respectively. Because the muon momentum is excluded from the E miss T definition in SR2, the \"emulated\" label is omitted from figure 3b. The W (\u2192 e\u03bd/\u00b5\u03bd)+jets control regions are similarly defined by selecting events containing one lepton with transverse momentum p T > 30 GeV (25 GeV) in the case of SR1 (SR2), and no additional leptons with p T > 20 GeV. The E miss T is emulated in the same way as for the Z \u2192 ee/\u00b5\u00b5 control region and events are required to pass the signal region selections on jets and E miss T . In SR1, the contributions of the three lepton flavours to the total W \u2192 \u03bd background after all the requirements are 20% for W \u2192 e\u03bd, 20% for W \u2192 \u00b5\u03bd, and 60% for W \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd.    suggest that these are events where the lepton is below its p T threshold or sufficiently far forward to escape the jet veto, and not events where the lepton is misidentified as a tag jet (since muons deposit little energy in the calorimeter and would therefore not be identified as a jet). This expectation is checked explicitly for the case of W \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd, by using MC truth information about the direction of the \u03c4 -lepton to find the \u2206R between the \u03c4 -lepton and the nearest reconstructed tag jet. The component with \u2206R j,\u03c4 < 0.4 is completely negligible after the signal region requirements, indicating that the lepton tends to be recoiling against the tag jets rather than being aligned with them. For SR1, four W control regions are considered using different charge samples for W + /W \u2212 \u2192 e\u03bd/\u00b5\u03bd since W (\u2192 \u03bd)+jets is not charge symmetric as shown in table 4, whereas in SR2, only two control regions W (\u2192 e\u03bd/\u00b5\u03bd)+jets are used as shown in table 5.",

(5.1) is used to estimate the multijet background. In order to obtain an explicit measurement and uncertainty for the background from multijets, no requirements are made on E miss T and m T . Because the multijet background does not have a prompt neutrino, the E miss T tends to be lower and to point in the direction of the jet that was misidentified as a lepton. As a result, the multijet background tends to have significantly lower m T than the W +jets contribution. Control samples modelling the jets misidentified as leptons in multijet events are constructed by selecting events that pass the W +jets control region selection, except for certain lepton identification criteria: for electrons, some of the EM calorimeter shower shape requirements are loosened and fully identified electrons are removed, while for muons, the transverse impact parameter (d 0 ) requirement which suppresses muons originating from heavy-flavour jets is reversed. To obtain the normalization of the multijet background in the W +jets control region, templates of the m T distribution for processes with prompt leptons are taken from MC simulation. Shape templates for the backgrounds from multijet events are constructed by summing the observed yields in control samples obtained by inverting the lepton identification and d 0 requirements, and subtracting the expected contributions from W +jets and Z+jets events using MC. Since the misidentified-jet samples are expected to be charge-symmetric, the same shape template and normalization factor is used to model both charge categories of a given lepton flavour (e or \u00b5). To determine the W (\u2192 \u03bd)+jets background normalization, a fit to the transverse mass m T of the lepton and E miss T is used. The W (\u2192 \u03bd)+jets contribution, however, is not charge symmetric, so the different charge samples are kept separate in the simultaneous fit to four m T distributions, one for each lepton flavour and charge combination shown in  for events with a prompt lepton, one for events where a jet is misidentified as an electron, and one for events where a jet is misidentified as a muon. The normalization factor for the prompt leptons in the m T fit is 0.95 \u00b1 0.05 (stat).",

The WIMP-nucleon cross-section limits resulting from searches for invisible Higgs boson decays extend from low WIMP mass to half the Higgs boson mass, and are complementary to the results provided by direct detection experiments that have limited sensitivity to WIMP with mass of the order of 10 GeV and lower [34,[36][37][38][39][40]42]. This is expected as the LHC has no limitations for the production of low-mass particles, whereas the recoil energies produced in the interactions of sub-relativistic WIMP with nuclei in the apparatus of a direct detection experiment are often below the sensitivity threshold for small WIMP masses. The aforementioned correlation between the branching fraction of Higgs boson decays to invisible particles and the WIMP-nucleon cross section is presented in the effective field theory framework, assuming that the new physics scale is O(a few) TeV, well above the scale probed at SM Higgs boson mass. Adding a renormalizable mechanism for generating the fermion and vector WIMP masses could modify the correlation between the WIMP-nucleon cross section and the branching fraction of Higgs boson decays to invisible particles [93].",
