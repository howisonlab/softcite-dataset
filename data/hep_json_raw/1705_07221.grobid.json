This measurement updates the previous published result by using 2.26 times more data and improved analysis methods. No significant evidence for nucleon decay has been observed and lower limits on the partial lifetime of the nucleon are obtained. The limits range from 3\u00d710 31 to 1\u00d710 34 years at 90% confidence level, depending on the decay mode.",

The standard model fails to include massive neutrinos or provide a satisfying explanation for charge quantization or the convergence of gauge couplings at high energy scales. These issues are addressed in Grand Unified Theories (GUTs), which embed the standard model in a single unifying gauge group such as SU(5) [1] or SO (10)  [2]. While numerous specific realizations of GUTs exist (see [3] for review), as a universal feature they predict nucleon decay, and therefore, baryon number violation. The gauge coupling unification scale is around 10 15\u221216 GeV, which is unreachable with accelerators but can be explored by virtual processes that induce nucleon decay with lifetimes of 10 32\u221235 years. The lower end of this lifetime range may yield observable event rates in long exposures of a large water Cherenkov detector such as Super-Kamiokande.",

However, depending on the model, the branching ratios for nucleon decay channels vary and different decay modes can dominate or be comparable to the favored channels. For example, in SU(5) the rate for n \u2192 e + \u03c0 \u2212 is twice that of p \u2192 e + \u03c0 0 [5]; however the latter mode has a stronger experimental signature. It is conceivable that rates for channels with heavy nonstrange mesons (\u03b7, \u03c1, \u03c9) are comparable in magnitude to those with pions [6]. In the lifetime limit where the expectation for any single channel is one event or less, searching in multiple decay modes enhances the chance that one observes any nucleon decay at all. Finally, observing proton decay from a non-standard channel in the absence of a signal from p \u2192 e + \u03c0 0 might hint at some exotic scenario.",

The SK experiment has been collecting data since 1996 in four different experimental phases denoted as SK-I to SK-IV. The inner detector photo coverage is around 40% in SK-I, SK-III, and SK-IV but was 19% in SK-II. New front-end electronics called QBEE [9] was implemented in SK-IV, which enabled deadtime-free data acquisition of a wide time window of PMT hit informa-tion. This enabled neutron capture to be included in SK-IV analyses. The SK detector has been extensively tuned and calibrated [8].",

The effective mass of the decayed neutron for n \u2192 e + \u03c0 \u2212 MC is shown in Figure 1. Unlike for the proton decay, there is no sharp peak at the neutron mass (940 MeV/c 2 ) because all the neutrons in a H 2 O molecule are bound in a nucleus and there is no free neutron decay. The largest and most energetic peak corresponds to the 1p-state; the 1s-state is nearby. The nuclear binding energies are 39.0 MeV for the 1s-state and 15.5 MeV for the 1p-state [15]. Correlated neutron decay, which accounts for the possibility of another nucleon recoiling with the decaying nucleon, makes the tail in the lower mass region.",

Mesons generated in an oxygen nucleus may interact with nucleons before they escape from the nucleus. The position of the nucleon decay in a nucleus is determined by the Woods-Saxon nuclear density distri- bution in the simulation. From this position, \u03c0, \u03b7, and \u03c9 mesons are tracked within the oxygen nucleus. The lifetime of the \u03c1 meson is short enough (\u03b2\u03b3c\u03c4 \u223c0.3 fm) that it decays immediately inside the nucleus into two \u03c0 mesons. Therefore, the nuclear effects of the \u03c1 meson itself are not considered in the simulation but those of the secondary pions are included. The pion interaction model in NEUT is a semi-classical cascade model. The interaction probabilities (mean free paths) for low momentum pions are calculated with the Delta-hole model by Oset et al. [17]. The pion interaction probabilities for high momentum pions are extracted from the \u03c0 \u00b1 -nucleus scattering experimental data. All the pion interaction probabilities and cross section parameters have been tuned with various \u03c0 \u00b1 -nucleus scattering data, including C, O, Al, Fe [7], since the previous paper [11]. Figure 2 shows the \u03c0 \u2212 cross sections of the external data and MC on 12 C [18]. The tuned MC used in this analysis increased the cross sections with the largest improvement at around 500 MeV/c.",

We do not adopt such contribution in this work. Table V shows the systematic errors on the number of expected background events for each systematic error source. After the event selection, the raw number of the remaining expected backgrounds is either zero or one in the lower signal box for p \u2192 l + \u03b7, \u03b7 \u2192 2\u03b3 searches. Therefore, the systematic errors are estimated in the total box (P tot < 250 MeV/c) and assumed to be same both in the upper and lower boxes. With the improved error estimation method, the systematic errors on the most dominant systematic error source in the previous analysis, hadron propagation in water, are reduced by factor 3-5 in this analysis.",

Thanks to the addition of SK-III and SK-IV data and various analysis improvements, the lifetime limits published in this paper are typically higher than those in the previous analysis by a factor of two to three, as shown in Fig. 22. However, some channels show similar or even lower limits due to more observed data candidates.  [27][28][29] and the previous SK analysis [11]. The p \u2192 l + \u03c0 0 results [7] are also included. Figure 22 compares the updated SK results with the other experiments; IMB-3 [27], KAMIOKANDE-I+II [28] and FREJUS [29]. The updated SK results are better than those by the other experiments by 1-2 orders of magnitude except for the n \u2192 l + \u03c1 0 channel. The relatively lower performance is due to low signal efficiencies with tight event selections and non-zero data candidates in the SK analyses. Note that systematic errors on the signal efficiencies were not included in the IMB-3 limit and thus the published results were optimistic.",
