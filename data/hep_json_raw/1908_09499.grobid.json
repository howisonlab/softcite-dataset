The decay D \u2192 K 0 S \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 is a suitable addition because it has a branching fraction of 5.2% [12], which is large compared to that of other multibody final states including K 0 S \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 . The decay occurs through many intermediate resonances, such as K 0 S \u03c9 and K * \u00b1 \u03c1 \u2213 , that lead to variations of the strong-phase difference over the phase space, a requirement for extracting \u03c6 3 from a single final state. However, a significant complication is that the four-body final state requires a binning of the five-dimensional D phase space, as opposed to a twodimensional Dalitz plot for the three-body case. The measurement is performed with an e + e \u2212 collision data sample collected by the Belle detector at a centre-of-mass energy corresponding to the \u03a5(4S) resonance. The sample contains 772 \u00d7 10 6 BB events corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 711 fb \u22121 . As an input to the analysis, we use the strong-phase difference measurements in phase space bins [13] obtained from an analysis of CLEO-c [14][15][16][17] data. 1 The remainder of this paper is arranged as follows. Section 2 describes the formalism of the method for measuring \u03c6 3 . The inputs derived from CLEO-c data and the Belle data and detector are described in sections 3 and 4, respectively, after which an overview of the analysis strategy is presented, in section 5. The event selection criteria are given in section 6, and the signal yield determination in the flavour-tagged D sample, which is a required input to the analysis, is presented in section 7. The measurement of CP violation in the B sample in bins of the D phase space is explained in section 8 and the related systematic uncertainty estimation is listed in section 9. The extraction of the physics parameter \u03c6 3 and the average of this result with previous Belle measurements are presented in section 10, before conclusions given in section 11.",

On the other hand, the model-independent method requires that measurements of CP -violating asymmetries are made in distinct regions of D meson phase space, which we refer to as bins. The binning reduces the statistical precision compared to the model-dependent method, but the uncertainty related to model assumptions is removed by using independent measurements of the average strong-phase differences, bin-by-bin. The average strong-phase differences can be determined using e + e \u2212 collision data at the open-charm threshold, which has been done for 13]. Therefore, given its systematic robustness, we follow the model-independent approach. We introduce the method in the remainder of this section.",

The sample of B + \u2192 D\u03c0 + is used as a control sample, as it is topologically identical to the signal, but with negligible expected CP violation [26]. The c i and s i results measured with CLEO-c data have been corrected for efficiency. Efficiency variation among bins will not matter if the efficiency profile is the same for both B + \u2192 Dh + and flavour-tagged D samples. This is partially achieved by requiring similar kinematic properties for the D meson in both samples. The efficiency profile depends primarily on D momentum, hence we select the flavour-tagged D sample in such a way that the D momentum approximately matches that of the B + \u2192 Dh + sample. The matching is not exact, so independent efficiency corrections are applied to the yields in both samples while calculating the parameters of interest.",

The amount of migration in both B and D * samples is estimated as a migration matrix M ij . The matrix has its diagonal elements close to one, and off-diagonal elements are small. MC samples of signal events are used to obtain the migration matrix. The data yield in each bin, Y i , is modified as Y i = M ij Y j . Any difference between the invariant mass resolution in the data and MC samples must be taken into account. We find the effect of the difference in resolution is only significant in bin 1, which contains the \u03c9 resonance. This bin is narrow due to the small natural width of the \u03c9. However, the natural width is the same order as the m \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 resolution, so there is significant migration out of this bin that is not compensated by migration into bin 1. Therefore, the M 1j elements of the migration matrix are determined after applying a Gaussian smearing to the value of m \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 by a scale factor.

The signal mean value and polynomial parameter for continuum background \u2206E distribution are determined from the fit to data, while all other shape parameters are fixed to those obtained from fits to appropriate MC samples. A scaling factor is applied on the \u2206E signal resolution, which is a free parameter in the fit. All C NN parameters are fixed to the values obtained from MC. An additional shift is applied on the continuum background mean value as well as a scaling factor to the resolution. Both these parameters are determined from data, which ensures that any possible data-MC difference is taken into account. We do not perform an independent fit in each bin because the event yields become too small to determine all the free parameters. Therefore, common shape parameters are used for each bin except for the combinatorial BB background component in bin 1. A separate exponential parameter is used in bin 1 due to the difference in slope compared to other bins. These exponential parameters are also floated in the fit in addition to those mentioned earlier.

The yield of signal JHEP10(2019)178 events is obtained from a two-dimensional unbinned extended maximum-likelihood fit to the distribution of M D and \u2206M for the selected candidates. The fit is performed independently in each bin. In general, there are two types of background: combinatorial, which is due to the random combination of final-state particles to form a D * + candidate, and randomslow-pion, in which a correctly reconstructed D meson combines with a \u03c0 + , which is not from a common D * + decay, to form a candidate. The combinatorial background peaks neither in the M D nor \u2206M distributions, whereas the random-slow-pion background peaks only in the M D distribution. The signal component of the M D distribution is described by a probability density function (PDF) that is the sum of a Crystal Ball (CB) [35, appendix E] function and two Gaussian functions with a common mean. The combinatorial background PDF is parametrized by a first-order polynomial. The signal PDF is also used to model the randomslow-pion background distribution in M D . The \u2206M signal PDF is described by the sum of an asymmetric Gaussian and three Gaussian functions with a common mean. The combinatorial background \u2206M distribution is parametrized by the sum of a threshold function and two Gaussian PDFs. The threshold function is f (\u2206M ) = (\u2206M \u2212 m \u03c0 ) + \u03b1(\u2206M \u2212 m \u03c0 ) + \u03b2(\u2206M \u2212 m \u03c0 )",

The check used the measured confidence intervals in (\u03c6 3 , r B , \u03b4 B ) to generate an ensemble of simulated data sets. Each simulated data set was then fit to form a distribution of (x \u00b1 , y \u00b1 ), which was found to be consistent with the (x \u00b1 , y \u00b1 ) confidence intervals measured. Hence we conclude that the reported confidence intervals for (\u03c6 3 , r B , \u03b4 B ) are appropriate.",

The ratio of the suppressed and favoured amplitudes is r B = 0.323 \u00b1 0.147 \u00b1 0.023 \u00b1 0.051. This measurement can be improved upon once a suitable amplitude model for D 0 \u2192 K 0 S \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 is available to provide guidance in choosing a more sensitive binning. Furthermore, the larger sample of e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03c8(3770) data that has been collected by BESIII will determine c i and s i more precisely, thus reducing the systematic uncertainty. The results presented here, combined with the improvements in binning and the increased sample of B decays that will be available at Belle II, mean that model-independent analysis of B + \u2192 D(K 0 S \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 )K + is a very promising addition to the suite of modes to be used to determine \u03c6 3 to a precision of 1-2 \u2022 [40].",
