            "text": "A search for supersymmetry involving the pair production of gluinos decaying via third-generation squarks into the lightest neutralino (\u03c7 0 1 ) is reported. It uses LHC proton-proton collision data at a centre-of-mass energy \u221a s = 13 TeV with an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb \u22121 collected with the ATLAS detector in 2015 and 2016. The search is performed in events containing large missing transverse momentum and several energetic jets, at least three of which must be identified as originating from b-quarks. To increase the sensitivity, the sample is divided into subsamples based on the presence or absence of electrons or muons. No excess is found above the predicted background. For\u03c7 0 1 masses below approximately 300 GeV, gluino masses of less than 1.97 (1.92) TeV are excluded at 95% confidence level in simplified models involving the pair production of gluinos that decay via top (bottom) squarks. An interpretation of the limits in terms of the branching ratios of the gluinos into third-generation squarks is also provided. These results improve upon the exclusion limits obtained with the 3.2 fb \u22121 of data collected in 2015.",

            "text": "Supersymmetry (SUSY) [1][2][3][4][5][6] is a generalisation of space-time symmetries that predicts new bosonic partners for the fermions and new fermionic partners for the bosons of the Standard Model (SM). If R-parity is conserved [7], SUSY particles are produced in pairs and the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) is stable. The scalar partners of the leftand right-handed quarks, the squarksq L andq R , can mix to form two mass eigenstates q 1 andq 2 , ordered by increasing mass. SUSY can solve the hierarchy problem [8][9][10][11] reducing unnatural tuning in the Higgs sector by orders of magnitude, provided that the superpartners of the top quark have masses not too far above the weak scale. The large top Yukawa coupling results in significantt L -t R mixing so that the mass eigenstatet 1 is typically JHEP06(2018)107 lighter than the other squarks [12,13]. Because of the SM weak-isospin symmetry, the mass of the lightest bottom squarkb 1 is also expected to be close to the weak scale. The fermionic partners of the gluons, the gluinos (g), are also motivated by naturalness [14] to have a mass around the TeV scale in order to limit their contributions to the radiative corrections to the top squark masses. For these reasons, and because the gluinos are expected to be pair-produced with a high cross-section at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the search for gluino production with decays via top and bottom squarks is highly motivated at the LHC. This paper presents a search for pair-produced gluinos decaying via top or bottom squarks in events with multiple jets originating from the hadronisation of b-quarks (b-jets in the following), high missing transverse momentum of magnitude E miss T , and potentially additional light-quark jets and/or an isolated charged lepton. 1 The dataset consists of 36.1 fb \u22121 of proton-proton (pp) collision data collected with the ATLAS detector [15] at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV in 2015 and 2016. Interpretations are provided in the context of several effective simplified models [16][17][18] probing various gluino decays into third-generation squarks and the LSP. The latter is assumed to be the lightest neutralin\u00f5 \u03c7 0 1 , a linear superposition of the superpartners of the neutral electroweak and Higgs bosons. One model also features the lightest charginos\u03c7 \u00b1 1 , which are linear superpositions of the superpartners of the charged electroweak and Higgs bosons. The results supersede the ones obtained using 3.2 fb \u22121 of data collected in 2015 using the same strategy [19]. Pairproduced gluinos with top-squark-mediated decays have also been searched for using events containing pairs of same-sign leptons or three leptons using 13 TeV data [20,21]. The samesign/three lepton search is comparable in sensitivity to the search presented in this paper only when the masses of the gluino and the LSP are very close to each other. Similar searches performed using the 13 TeV dataset collected in 2015 and 2016 by the CMS experiment have produced results comparable to the ATLAS searches [22][23][24][25].",

In terms of experimental signature, they all contain at least four b-jets originating from either gluino or top quark decays, and two\u03c7 0 1 , which escape the detector unseen, resulting in high E miss T . Gluinos are assumed to be pair-produced and to decay either asg \u2192b 1b org \u2192t 1t (the charge conjugate process is implied throughout this paper). The following top and bottom squark decays are then considered: 2 In all cases, the top or bottom squarks are assumed to be off-shell in order to have simplified models with only two parameters: the gluino and\u03c7 0 1 masses. 3 All other sparticles are decoupled. 1 The term \"lepton\" refers exclusively to an electron or a muon in this paper. 2 The decayb1 \u2192 t\u03c7 \u2212 1 is also possible but, followingg \u2192b1b, it yields the same final state asg \u2192t * 1 t \u2192 (b\u03c7 \u2212 1 )t, which is already considered. 3 The analysis sensitivity is found to be mostly independent of the top and bottom squark masses, except when the top squark is very light [26].  Two simplified models are used to optimise the event selection and to interpret the results. In the Gbb (Gtt) model, illustrated in figure 1(a) (1(b)), each gluino undergoes an effective three-body decayg \u2192 bb\u03c7 0 1 (g \u2192 tt\u03c7 0 1 ) via off-shell bottom (top) squarks, with a branching ratio of 100%. The Gbb model is the simplest in terms of particle multiplicity, resulting in the minimal common features of four b-jets and two\u03c7 0 1 . In addition to these particles, the Gtt model produces four W bosons originating from the top quark decays: t \u2192 W b. The presence of these four W bosons motivates the design of signal regions with a higher jet multiplicity than for Gbb models, and in some cases with at least one isolated electron or muon.",

The parton shower, fragmentation, and the underlying event were simulated using Pythia v6.428 [37] with the CTEQ6L1 PDF set [38]. The h damp parameter in Powheg, which controls the p T of the first additional emission beyond the Born level and thus regulates the p T of the recoil emission against the tt system, was set to the mass of the top quark (m top = 172.5 GeV). All events with at least one leptonically decaying W boson are included. Single-top and tt events in which all top quarks decay hadronically do not contain sufficient E miss T to contribute significantly to the background. Smaller backgrounds in the signal region come from the production of tt pairs in association with W/Z/h bosons and possibly additional jets, and production of tttt, W/Z+jets and W W /W Z/ZZ (diboson) events. Other potential sources of background, such as the production of three top quarks or three gauge bosons, are expected to be negligible. The production of tt pairs in association with electroweak vector bosons W and Z was modelled by samples generated at LO using MadGraph5 aMC@NLO v2.2.2 and showered with Pythia v8.186, while samples to model ttH production were generated using Mad-Graph5 aMC@NLO v2.2.1 and showered with Herwig++ [39] v2.7.1. These samples are described in detail in ref. [40]. MadGraph5 aMC@NLO was also used to simulate the tttt production and the showering was performed with Pythia v8.186. The W/Z+jets processes were simulated using the Sherpa v2.2.0 [41] event generator, while Sherpa v2.1.1 was used to simulate diboson production processes. Matrix elements for the W/Z+jets and diboson processes were calculated using Comix [42] and OpenLoops [43] and merged with the Sherpa parton shower [44] using the ME+PS@NLO prescription [45]. The Sherpa diboson sample cross-section was scaled down to account for its use of \u03b1 QED = 1/129 rather than 1/132, corresponding to the use of current Particle Data Group [46] parameters, as input to the G \u00b5 scheme [47].

In-time and out-of-time pile-up interactions from the same or nearby bunch-crossings were simulated by overlaying additional pp collisions generated by Pythia v8.186 using the A2 tune [53] and the MSTW2008LO parton distribution function set [54] on top of the hard-scattering events.

Each topological cluster is calibrated to the electromagnetic scale response prior to jet reconstruction. The reconstructed jets are then calibrated to the particle level by the application of a jet energy scale (JES) derived from \u221a s = 13 TeV data and simulations [75]. Quality criteria are imposed to reject events that contain at least one jet arising from non-collision sources or detector noise [76]. Further selections are applied to reject jets that originate from pile-up interactions by means of a multivariate algorithm using information about the tracks matched to each jet [77]. Candidate jets are required to have p T > 20 GeV and |\u03b7| < 2.8. After resolving overlaps with electrons and muons, selected jets are required to satisfy the stricter requirement of p T > 30 GeV. A jet is tagged as a b-jet candidate by means of a multivariate algorithm using information about the impact parameters of inner detector tracks matched to the jet, the presence of displaced secondary vertices, and the reconstructed flight paths of b-and c-hadrons inside the jet [78,79]. The b-tagging working point corresponding to an efficiency of 77% to identify b-jets with p T > 20 GeV, as determined from a sample of simulated tt events, is found to be optimal for the statistical significance of this search. The corresponding rejection factors against jets originating from c-quarks, \u03c4 -leptons and light quarks and gluons in the same sample at this working point are 6, 22 and 134, respectively.",

These uncertainties arise from the extrapolation of the tt normalisation obtained in the CRs to the SRs as well as from the yields of the minor backgrounds in the SRs, which are predicted by the simulation. The total systematic uncertainties range from approximately 20% to 80% in the various SRs. The detector-related systematic uncertainties affect both the background estimate and the signal yield. The largest sources in this analysis relate to the jet energy scale, jet energy resolution (JER) and the b-tagging efficiencies and mistagging rates. The JES uncertainties for the small-R jets are derived from \u221a s = 13 TeV data and simulations while the JER uncertainties are extrapolated from 8 TeV data using MC simulations [89]. These uncertainties are also propagated to the re-clustered large-R jets, which use them as inputs. The jet mass scale and resolution uncertainties have a negligible impact on the re-clustered jet mass. The impact of the JES uncertainties on the expected background yields is between 4% and 35%, while JER uncertainties affect the background yields by approximately 0-26% in the various regions. Uncertainties in the measured b-tagging efficiencies and mistagging rates are the subleading sources of experimental uncertainty. The impact of these uncertainties on the expected background yields is 3-24% depending on the considered region. The uncertainties associated with lepton reconstruction and energy measurements have a negligible impact on the final results. All lepton and jet measurement uncertainties are propagated to the calculation of E miss T , and additional uncertainties are included in the scale and resolution of the soft term. The overall impact of the E miss T soft-term uncertainties is also small. Since the normalisation of the tt background is fit to data in the CRs, uncertainties in the modelling of this background only affect the extrapolation from the CRs to the SRs and VRs. Hadronisation and parton showering model uncertainties are estimated using a sample generated with Powheg and showered by Herwig++ v2.7.1 with the UEEE5 underlying-event tune. Systematic uncertainties in the modelling of initial-and final-state radiation are explored with Powheg samples showered with two alternative settings of Pythia v6.428. The first of these uses the PERUGIA2012radHi tune [50] and has the renormalisation and factorisation scales set to twice the nominal value, resulting in more radiation in the final state. In addition, it has h damp set to 2m top . The second sample, using the PERUGIA2012radLo tune, has h damp = m top and the renormalisation and factorisation scales are set to half of their nominal values, resulting in less radiation in the event. In each case, the uncertainty is taken as the change in the expected yield of tt background with respect to the nominal sample. The uncertainty due to the choice of event generator is estimated by comparing the expected yields obtained using a tt sample generated with MadGraph5 aMC@NLO and one that is generated with Powheg. Both of these samples are showered with Herwig++ v2.7.1. The total theoretical uncertainty in the inclusive tt background is taken as the sum in quadrature of these individual components. An additional uncertainty is assigned to the fraction of tt events produced in association with additional heavy-flavour jets (i.e. tt+ \u2265 1b and tt+ \u2265 1c), a process which suffers from large -23 -   Figure 6. Relative systematic uncertainty in the background estimate for the (a) cut-and-count and (b) multi-bin analyses.

Two strategies are employed: one in which the signal regions are optimised for discovery, and another one in which several non-overlapping signal regions are fitted simultaneously to achieve optimal exclusion limits for benchmark signals.
