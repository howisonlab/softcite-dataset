            "text": "This paper outlines a method for improving the precision of atmospheric neutrino oscillation measurements. One experimental signature for these oscillations is an observed deficit in the rate of \u03bd \u00b5 charged-current interactions with an oscillatory dependence on L \u03bd /E \u03bd , where L \u03bd is the neutrino propagation distance, and E \u03bd is the neutrino energy. For contained-vertex atmospheric neutrino interactions, the L \u03bd /E \u03bd resolution varies significantly from event to event. The precision of the oscillation measurement can be improved by incorporating information on L \u03bd /E \u03bd resolution into the oscillation analysis. In the analysis presented here, a Bayesian technique is used to estimate the L \u03bd /E \u03bd resolution of observed atmospheric neutrinos on an event-by-event basis. By separating the events into bins of L \u03bd /E \u03bd resolution in the oscillation analysis, a significant improvement in oscillation sensitivity can be achieved.",

In the standard theory, the oscillations arise from quantum mechanical mixing between the neutrino flavour eigenstates. This is governed by a unitary PMNS mixing matrix [1][2][3], which can be parameterised using three mixing angles and a CP-violating phase. The amplitudes of the oscillations depend on the sizes of the mixing angles, whereas the wavelengths depend on the neutrino squared-mass splittings, \u2206m 2 ji = m 2 j \u2212 m 2 i , and also on L \u03bd /E \u03bd , where L \u03bd is the neutrino propagation distance and E \u03bd is the neutrino energy.",

The size of the deficit varies with L \u03bd /E \u03bd according to the formula given in Eq. 1. The \u03bd \u00b5 CC interactions are identified by the presence of an emitted muon, which may also be accompanied by additional shower activity produced by the final-state hadronic system. The neutrino kinematics can be reconstructed by combining measurements of the emitted muon and hadronic system, obtained by analysing the observed hits in the detector.

Typically, the energy and direction of the muon can be measured precisely. However, the measurement of the hadronic system has a worse resolution. Therefore, the resolution of both E \u03bd and \u03b8 \u03bd improves with E \u00b5 /E \u03bd , where E \u00b5 is the muon energy. The angular resolution also improves with neutrino energy since the final-state particles are increasingly aligned with the incident neutrino direction. This is particularly important when the reconstructed muon direction is used to approximate the neutrino direction. The overall resolution is dependent on the precise configuration of the detector geometry. For example, the resolution is worse if there are fewer hits in the detector, or if the final-state particles are not fully contained in the detector.",

At each point in the integral, the true values of L \u03bd and E \u03bd , and therefore log 10 (L \u03bd /E \u03bd ), are calculated. A weight is assigned as given by the product of the input PDFs, and the value of log 10 (L \u03bd /E \u03bd ) is entered into the posterior PDF with this weight. The values of log 10 (L \u03bd ) and log 10 (E \u03bd ) are entered into a separate set of PDFs, providing information on the relative resolution of L \u03bd and E \u03bd for each event.
