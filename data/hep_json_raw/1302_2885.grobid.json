However, some BSM scenarios like e.g. R-parity violating SUSY predict measurable enhancements. A search for FCNC in top quark decays is presented, which is performed using an event topology with three leptons from the decay chain tt \u2192 Zq+Wb \u2192 llq+l\u03bdb, where l can be e or \u00b5 [16]. Events with three isolated leptons with high p T , at least two jets and a high E miss T are selected. In addition, the scalar p T sum S T is required to be larger than 250 GeV, and the reconstructed top quark masses have to be within 100 and 250 GeV. The corresponding mass distributions are shown in Fig. 6. No deviation from the Standard Model is found and an observed upper limit at 95% C.L. on B(t \u2192 Zq) of 0.21% is determined, where 0.40% have been expected. A more stringent event selection using b-tags instead of S T confirms this result.   Semileptonic events with muons are selected, with two of the four jets being b-tagged. Using the best approximation to the top quark mass, the tagged b-jets are assigned to either the leptonically or hadronically decaying top quark. In the presence of a soft muon in at least on of the b-jets, the charge of both b-quark can be determined. The charge of the leptonically decaying top quark is calculated as q t = q \u00b5 + q b , where q \u00b5 is the reconstructed charge of the isolated muon and q b the charge determined for the b-jet assigned to this decay branch. The resulting charge distribution is shown in Fig. 7 on the left.",
