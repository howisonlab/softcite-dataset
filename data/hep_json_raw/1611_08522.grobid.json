We present a method to infer the momenta of b-hadrons produced in hadron collider experiments using information from their reconstructed flight vectors. Our method is strictly agnostic to the decay itself, which implies that it can be validated with control samples of topologically similar decays to fully reconstructible final states. A multivariate regression algorithm based on the flight information provides a b-hadron momentum estimate with a resolution of around 60% which is sufficient to select the correct solution to the quadratic equation in around 70% of cases. This will improve the ability of hadron collider experiments to make differential decay rate measurements with semileptonic b-hadron decays.",

The majority of studies have been restricted to B + and B 0 mesons produced by e + e \u2212 colliders operating at the \u03a5(4S) resonance. The presence of an unreconstructible neutrino in the final state poses an experimental challenge. However, in exclusive production of BB meson pairs in e + e \u2212 collisions at the \u03a5(4S) resonance, the decay kinematics of the B can be resolved by balancing against theB decay or vice versa.",

            "text": "Hadron collider experiments offer an enticing opportunity to make complementary studies with other b-hadron species. The busy hadronic environment and inclusive production mechanism make these studies challenging. However, there is an important advantage, which is that the b-hadrons tend to have a large Lorentz boost, especially at the forward rapidities that are covered by the LHCb experiment [1]. The measured flight vector joining the primary pp interaction vertex and the b-hadron decay vertex can be exploited to constrain the decay kinematics [2]. Decays with a single missing particle obviously have an unknown 3-momentum if an assumption is made about the mass of this particle. Two independent constraints are provided by momentum conservation transverse to the flight vector. A third is provided by the assumption of the parent b-hadron mass, though this constraint is quadratic and therefore presents two solutions. One possibility [3] is to consider b-hadrons that originate from decays of narrow excited b-hadron states. If the other decay products from these decays are reconstructed then the mass of the excited state provides a further constraint on the kinematics of the child b-hadron.",

A similar measurement with B 0 s \u2192 K \u2212 \u00b5 + \u03bd \u00b5 is highly anticipated, given the precise lattice calculations [6], which could permit the single most precise determination of |V ub |/|V cb |. One of the challenges for a hadron collider experiment is to determine the invariant mass squared of the \u03bd system, denoted q 2 , to permit a measurement of the differential decay rate as a function of this quantity. As a result, the LHCb measurement [4] of the \u039b 0 b \u2192 p\u00b5 \u2212\u03bd \u00b5 decay rate is restricted to a single high q 2 region. 1 In order to suppress the contamination from decays originating outside this q 2 region, it was required that both solutions of the quadratic equation described above fall into the desired window.

Unless explicitly stated otherwise, the studies that follow are based on the 13 TeV sample. A right-handed coordinate system is defined with z along the beam axis into the detector, y vertical and x horizontal. The magnitude of the momentum of a particle is denoted P , and the component transverse to the z axis is defined as p T = P sin \u03b8. The component of the momentum along the z axis is denoted p z . A particle has a pseudorapidity defined as \u03b7 = \u2212 ln (tan(\u03b8/2)). A particle of energy E is defined to have a rapidity of y = 1 2 ln ((E + p z )/(E \u2212 p z )). Signal b-hadron candidates are required to be produced within the range 2 < \u03b7 < 5, which corresponds to the approximate kinematic acceptance of the LHCb detector [8]. Figure 1 shows, for each of the three centre-of-mass energies under consideration, the P , p T and \u03b7 distributions of the b-hadrons in the event sample. One of the first things to notice is that the p T distribution has a smaller tail than the momentum distribution. This is a feature that is exploited in this work. With increasing centre-of-mass energy, the b-hadron production tends to be at larger pseudorapidities and larger momenta, but the p T spectrum is less strongly affected.",

            "text": "Since the main features that we try to utilise in this study are related to the line of flight between the b-hadron production and decay vertices, which is denoted F , it is crucial that we model the resolution in the associated variables. The x and y co-ordinates of the bhadron decay vertices are smeared by \u00b120 \u00b5m according to a Gaussian distribution. In the z direction a larger resolution of \u00b1200 \u00b5m is assumed. For the production vertices we assume JHEP02(2017)021  resolutions of \u00b113 \u00b5m in x and y, and \u00b170 \u00b5m in z. These assumptions approximately reflect the reported peformance of the LHCb VELO detector [9]. In all subsequent studies it is required that the smeared flight length is larger than 3 mm, which approximates the effect of typical trigger and analysis selections of b-hadron decays by LHCb. In order to study possible physics analysis applications, several b-hadron decays are simulated, with a focus on B 0 s mesons which are copiously produced in hadron colliders. In order to efficiently utilise the simulated b-hadron samples, all species are considered to be B 0 s mesons for the purpose of studying their decays. This is justified by the fact that the fragmentation fractions have been measured to exhibit modest kinematic dependencies in the LHCb acceptance [10]. Exclusive decays of B 0 s mesons to D \u2212 s \u00b5 + \u03bd \u00b5 and K \u2212 \u00b5 + \u03bd \u00b5 are simulated with a simple phase space description, which is considered to be sufficiently accurate for the present study. The D \u2212 s mesons subsequently decay to the K + K \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 final state. In all studies involving the B 0 s decay products it is required that the charged final state particles satisfy p T > 250 MeV, P > 5 GeV, 1.9 < \u03b7 < 4.9. Natural units with c = 1 are used throughout this document. For the K \u2212 \u00b5 + \u03bd \u00b5 decay mode, tighter selection requirements are imposed. The muon (kaon) must satisfy p T > 1(0.5) GeV. As a background in the study of B 0 s \u2192 K \u2212 \u00b5 + \u03bd \u00b5 , we simulate the decay B 0 s \u2192 (K * \u2212 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 0 )\u00b5 + \u03bd \u00b5 , in which the \u03c0 0 isn't reconstructed.",

As an alternative, we consider the possibility to reconstruct theb-hadron that is produced in association with the signal b. Even at b(b)-quark level the naive p T balance between the b andb is spoilt by the broad bb p T spectrum.

The independent data are used to evaluate the performance of the algorithm in estimating the b-hadron momentum from the values of the two flight variables.  Figure 5 shows the distribution of the inferred b-hadron momentum, P inf , versus the true b-hadron momentum. The correlation coefficient is around 70%. In table 1, the correlation coefficients between P true and the two flight variables are listed for the three centre of mass energies and various selection requirements on the simulated B 0 s \u2192 K \u2212 \u00b5 + \u03bd \u00b5 decays. Also listed are the correlations between P true and the inferred momentum that would be returned by the regression using only 1/ sin \u03b8 flight , which is denoted P \u03b8 inf . It can be seen that as expected these values are close to the corresponding correlations with the raw flight angle variable itself. The final column of table 1 lists the correlations between P true and P inf . It can be seen that the combination of the two variables in the regression algorithm increases the correlation by around 10% compared to the more powerful angular variable alone. Hardly any dependence on the centre-of-mass energy is seen. There is a degradation of the correlations of up to 10% when applying the acceptance and selection requirements on the charged decay products of the simulated B 0 s \u2192 K \u2212 \u00b5 + \u03bd \u00b5 decays. Figure 6 (left) shows the distribution of (P inf \u2212 P true )/P true and the corresponding distribution for P \u03b8 inf instead of P inf . As expected the shapes of these distributions roughly resemble the underlying b-hadron p T spectrum shown in figure 1. In figure 6 (right) the corresponding profiles of the mean |P inf \u2212 P true |/P true are shown as a function of \u03b7.

Nevertheless the first observation of B 0 s \u2212B 0 s oscillations by the CDF experiment was based on a combination of hadronic and semileptonic B 0 s decays [16], and LHCb made an observation of this phenomenon using semileptonic B 0 s decays alone [17].

LHCb currently achieves an effective tagging power of a few percent [23] but this hypothetical study assumes perfect tagging. Figure 15 shows the mixed and unmixed decay time distributions and A mix for various different measures of the decay time. Using the uncorrected visible momentum, the first oscillation is well resolved, but subsequent oscillations are rapidly smeared out. This behaviour is not improved when scaling the momentum by a visible mass dependent factor. If a random solution to the quadratic equation is used, then the damping of the oscillations is slower. Applying our method to select the best solution the oscillations are resolved with an amplitude of around 20% with minimal degradation at higher decay times. Figure 15 (lower right) shows how the sensitivity to the oscillations can be enhanced by restricting to a region of larger A \u00b1 (> 0.23). 4 The next challenge is to perform this analysis in bins of rapidity while unfolding for resolution. Figure 16 (left) shows the distribution of the visible rapidity versus the true rapidity. It can be seen in figure 16 (right) that the corresponding distribution with the best quadratic rapidity shows a better resolution in this variable. Figure 17 shows the bin purities in y for different choices of bin boundaries. A comparison is made for (open markers) y defined using the visible energy and momentum and (closed markers) y defined using the best quadratic solution with our method. It is clear that the later approach will permit a finer binning. While the mixing element of the example analysis with B 0 s mesons may prove to be very challenging, the improved rapidity definition is applicable to production studies with other b-hadron species for which a more straightforward decay time integrated study is sufficient.",

An independent estimate of the b-hadron momentum would be valuable since it could resolve the quadratic ambiguity. We propose a method with which to estimate the momenta of the b-hadrons using information that is totally independent of the b-hadron decays. This exploits the fact that the flight direction and decay length JHEP02(2017)021 of a b-hadron are well measured and are both correlated to the b-hadron momentum. A simple regression analysis yields a resolution of around 60% in the b-hadron momentum. This seemingly modest momentum estimate is sufficient to select the correct solution to the quadratic equation with an average rate of around 70%. This means that differential measurements of decay rates as a function of the invariant mass squared of the leptonneutrino system in semileptonic decays can be made with finer binning. The method can also be applied in studies of b-hadron production. As a highly challenging test case we consider the example of measuring the B 0 s \u2212B 0 s production asymmetry in bins of rapidity, which requires the resolution of the fast B 0 s \u2212B 0 s oscillations. Our method permits a finer binning in rapidity and improves the resolution on the B 0 s \u2212B 0 s oscillations. The general method can be perfectly validated using control samples of fully reconstructed b-hadron decays, and it should be easy to apply to analyses since it only requires knowledge of the position of the primary pp interaction vertex and the b-hadron decay vertex.",
