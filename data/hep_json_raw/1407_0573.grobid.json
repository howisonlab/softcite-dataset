Events are selected with two high transverse momentum leptons consisting of an oppositely charged electron and muon pair. The three processes are separated using the distributions of the missing transverse momentum of events with zero and greater than zero jet multiplicities. Measurements of the fiducial cross-section are presented along with results that quantify for the first time the underlying correlations in the predicted and measured cross-sections due to proton parton distribution functions. These results indicate that the correlated next-to-leading-order predictions for tt and Z=\u03b3 \u00c3 \u2192 \u03c4\u03c4 underestimate the data, while those at next-to-next-to-leading-order generally describe the data well. The full cross-sections are measured to be \u03c3\u00f0tt\u00de \u00bc 181.2 AE 2.8 \u00fe9.7 \u22129.5 AE 3.3 AE 3.3 pb, \u03c3\u00f0W \u00fe W \u2212 \u00de \u00bc 53.3 AE 2.7 \u00fe7.3 \u22128.0 AE 1.0 AE 0.5 pb, and \u03c3\u00f0Z=\u03b3 \u00c3 \u2192 \u03c4\u03c4\u00de \u00bc 1174 AE 24 \u00fe72 \u221287 AE 21 AE 9 pb, where the cited uncertainties are due to statistics, systematic effects, luminosity and the LHC beam energy measurement, respectively.

            "text": "Proton collisions at the LHC have large cross-sections for the production of top quark pairs, W boson pairs, and Z bosons. The cross-section for each of these processes is predicted to a high precision within the standard model (SM) of particle physics. In this article, a global test of these SM predictions is presented through the study of a common final state including an oppositely charged electron and muon pair (e\u03bc events). Specifically, a simultaneous measurement of the cross-sections of the pair production of top quarks (tt), W bosons (W \u00fe W \u2212 , written as WW), and tau leptons via the Drell-Yan mechanism (Z=\u03b3 \u00c3 \u2192 \u03c4\u03c4) is performed. These processes are considered in a twodimensional parameter space spanned by the missing transverse momentum, E miss T , and jet multiplicity, N jets , where they are naturally well separated, allowing the simultaneous extraction of their cross-sections. Events from tt production tend to have large E miss T and large N jets , whereas WW events tend to have large E miss T and small N jets , and Z=\u03b3 \u00c3 \u2192 \u03c4\u03c4 events are characterized by small E miss T and even smaller N jets . This analysis of e\u03bc events allows a broader test of the SM than that given by dedicated cross-section measurements, and provides a first simultaneous measurement of the production cross-sections for the processes of interest at the LHC. This simultaneous measurement unifies the definitions of fiducial region, physics object and event selections, and estimation of uncertainties for each signal measurement. In particular these measurements offer a new window on the effects of the parton distribution functions (PDF) through consideration of the correlations between pairs of production cross-sections, induced by the use of common PDF predictions. An improved understanding of these processes can improve the theoretical calculations and methods used in their study, and thereby more precisely constrain background predictions for future new physics searches at the LHC.",

            "text": "In particular, the inner detector, the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters, and the muon spectrometer must deliver data of high quality to ensure that electrons, muons, jets, and missing transverse momentum are measured accurately. The data selected for this study were collected using single-lepton triggers (e or \u03bc). In the case of the electron trigger, a threshold is applied to the transverse energy (E T ) of the electron while for the muon trigger a threshold is applied to the transverse momentum (p T ) of the muon. Due to the increases in luminosity achieved by the LHC during the 2011 run, the value of the electron E T threshold applied changed during the course of the year. Thresholds employed by the electron trigger were either 20 or 22 GeV while the muon trigger threshold remained constant at 18 GeV. The data collected correspond to an integrated luminosity of 4.6 fb \u22121 , after applying data quality requirements, with an uncertainty of 1.8% [3]. Monte Carlo simulated events are generated at ffiffi ffi s p \u00bc 7 TeV and processed through a detector simulation [11] based on GEANT4 [12]. In these samples, all particle masses are taken from 2010 values published by the Particle Data Group [13] with the exception of the top quark mass, which is taken to be 172.5 GeV and the Higgs boson mass which is set to 125 GeV. The simulation includes modeling of additional pp interactions in the same and neighboring bunch crossings, referred to as pileup. These events are subsequently reweighted such that the distribution of the number of interactions per bunch crossing in simulation matches that of data. Corrections to the selection efficiency of electrons and muons are applied to simulated events, and the detector simulation is tuned to reproduce the energy and momentum measurements and resolution observed in data. Unless otherwise specified, common attributes between the Monte Carlo samples are the generation of the underlying event (UE), which is performed by PYTHIA v. 6.425 [14] or JIMMY v. 4.31 [15] (included as part of the HERWIG v. 6.520 [16] software package), and the choice of PDFs, which is the next-to-leading-order (NLO) CT10 set [17]. An exception is the ALPGEN [18] generator configurations which use the leading-order set CTEQ6L1 [19].",

The candidates are required to have a transverse energy of E T > 25 GeV and meet the tight selection criteria [43] optimized for the 2011 data-taking period. These criteria are based on the quality of the position and momentum association between the extrapolated track and the calorimeter energy cluster, the consistency of the longitudinal and lateral shower profiles with those expected for an incident electron, and the observed transition radiation in the TRT. To suppress background from photon conversions, the electron track is required to have a hit in the innermost layer of the tracking system. Muon candidates are reconstructed by combining the information from pairs of stand-alone ID and MS tracks to form a single track [44,45].

These topological clusters are seeded by calorimeter cells with energy jE cell j > 4\u03c3, where \u03c3 is the cell-by-cell RMS of the noise (electronics plus pileup). Neighboring cells are added if jE cell j > 2\u03c3 and topological clusters are formed through an iterative procedure. In a final step, all remaining neighboring cells are added to the topological cluster. The baseline calibration for these topological clusters calculates their energy using the electromagnetic energy scale [47]. This is established using test-beam measurements for electrons and muons in the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters [48,49]. Effects due to noncompensation, energy losses in the dead material, shower leakage, as well as inefficiencies in energy clustering and jet reconstruction are also taken into account. This is done by associating calorimeter jets with simulated jets in bins of \u03b7 and E, and is supplemented by an in situ calibration. This jet energy scale calibration is thoroughly discussed in Ref. [50].",

The uncertainty due to the choice of Monte Carlo generator is determined for tt and WW by comparing the default generators to POWHEG while the uncertainty due to the modeling of the parton shower and fragmentation is evaluated by interfacing the default generators to PYTHIA. In the case of Z=\u03b3 \u00c3 \u2192 \u03c4\u03c4, the theoretical uncertainties are calculated by comparing SHERPA to the appropriate ALPGEN sample interfaced to HERWIG. The evaluation of the uncertainty due to the choice of PDF has been described in Sec. VI D.",

Intercalibration of forward region detector response from the central regions of the detector also contributes to the total uncertainty on jet energy scale. Additional uncertainties due to pileup and close-by jet effects are also included. The uncertainty introduces distortions in the template shapes including effects propagated to the calculation of E miss T . To obtain an estimate of this source of uncertainty, the jet energy scale is broken into sixteen independent components.

The theoretical uncertainties on the correction factors C are small. No individual source of theoretical uncertainty on C exceeds the uncertainty due to experimental effects (dominated by those associated with electron scale factors and luminosity). One effect observed from this table is that there is apparent anticorrelation between uncertainties on A and C, leading to an uncertainty on their product that is smaller than that on the multiplicands, e.g. the ISR=FSR \u00fe scale uncertainty. Uncertainties on branching ratios [56] used in the cross-section calculations are negligible relative to experimental uncertainties and not included in Table II. Within the fiducial region, uncertainties on C come mainly from experimental sources and template shape uncertainties. The dominant source varies between signals; template shape uncertainties are dominant in the WW measurement, where the likelihood fit is sensitive to variation in the scale of E miss T -cellout terms.

The computed WW cross-section does not include the contribution from gg \u2192 H \u2192 WW, which is expected to contribute roughly 5% of the total WW cross-section as discussed in Sec. III B. Fiducial calculations are performed TABLE V. Summary of fitted yields (unrounded), acceptance correction factors, and cross-section measurements. The acceptance correction factors, A \u2022 C and C, are extracted from simulated events. The branching ratios are taken from the best theoretical calculations or experimental measurements [56]. The fiducial and full cross-sections are calculated using Eqs. (4) and (5) and accompanied by statistical uncertainties, systematic uncertainties, and uncertainties associated with the luminosity and LHC beam energy. Also given is a breakdown of the systematic uncertainty including template normalization uncertainties, template shape uncertainties, and uncertainties attributed to the estimation of the fake or nonprompt background. Fiducial cross-sections for tt and WW where leptons from \u03c4 decays are excluded from the definition of the fiducial region are also given along with the ratio, R C , used to translate to the fiducial region that includes leptons from \u03c4 decays. The factor R C is defined as the ratio between the acceptance when \u03c4 decays are included in the definition and when \u03c4 decays are not. for the region excluding electrons or muons from tau-lepton decays. Theoretical predictions were calculated for the following PDF sets: ABM11 [57], MSTW2008CPdeut [58], CT10, HERAPDF15 [59], NNPDF2.3 [32], JR09 [60] (for NNLO calculations) and epWZ [61] (for NNLO calculations). In both figures, the markers represent the cross-sections calculated for a pair of processes using a specific central PDF with its error bars depicting the uncertainty due to the choice of renormalization (\u03bc R ) and factorization (\u03bc F ) scales. No attempt is made to treat these scale choices in a correlated way between processes. The asymmetric scale uncertainty is obtained from the maximum upper and lower deviation from the central value (\u03bc R and \u03bc F ) found in a process-specific grid composed of seven cross-sections. These were calculated by independently varying values of \u03bc R and \u03bc F by factors of 1=2, 1 and 2 (while ignoring the cases where \u03bc R is doubled and \u03bc F is halved and vice versa). The central values of \u03bc R and \u03bc F are set to process-specific values: m t for tt, m W for WW, and m Z for Z=\u03b3 \u00c3 \u2192 \u03c4\u03c4.",

Although larger acceptance uncertainties clearly reduce the separation power with respect to the fiducial measurements, here the full theoretical calculations at NNLO in QCD can be used for Z=\u03b3 \u00c3 \u2192 \u03c4\u03c4 versus tt, as shown in Fig. 7(d). As described in Sec. III, the software packages FEWZ and TOP ++ were used to calculate the cross-sections to NNLO.  Fig. 7(c)  (NLO case) shows good overlap between the experimental measurement and most of the NNLO theoretical predictions and corresponding PDF sets for Z=\u03b3 \u00c3 \u2192 \u03c4\u03c4 versus tt where they are available. Also notable is the difference in the uncertainties in theoretical predictions: in the NLO case scale uncertainties are dominant, while in the NNLO case the PDF model provides the dominant uncertainty. Theory contours using ABM11 and JR09 PDFs, however, do not overlap with the measurements. For the former, one significant reason for a lower tt cross-section lies in the value of \u03b1 s employed in its calculation. At NNLO its value is 0.113, which is substantially lower than the range of 0.117 to 0.118 employed by most of the other PDF models here. In the case of JR09, which is only considered in the comparison of NNLO calculations, the 5% difference in the Z=\u03b3 \u00c3 \u2192 \u03c4\u03c4 cross-section is consistent with what is reported elsewhere [60].

Exactly two high transverse momentum isolated leptons are selected, and are required to be one electron and one muon of opposite charge. The number of signal events is extracted using a template fit to the distribution of missing transverse momentum and jet multiplicity observed in the data. The measurements are consistent with the previously published dedicated ATLAS crosssection measurements and with the predicted theoretical cross-sections within their uncertainties. This simultaneous extraction of the cross-sections for these processes at the LHC provides a broader test of the SM predictions than individual measurements by unifying the fiducial region, object and event requirements, and background estimations. The uncertainty bands of the measured fiducial crosssections of tt and Z=\u03b3 \u00c3 \u2192 \u03c4\u03c4 suggest that the NLO predictions underestimate the data, while comparisons to NNLO calculations indicate that MSTW2008, CT10, HERAPDF, NNPDF, and epWZ PDF sets describe the data well.
