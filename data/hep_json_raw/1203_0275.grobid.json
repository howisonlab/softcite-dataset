Previous measurements [1][2][3][4] yield a world average value of M W = 80 399\u00b123 MeV [5] and, in conjunction with other electroweak data, determine the Higgs boson mass to be M H = 89 +35 \u221226 GeV [5]. If the Higgs boson is observed, the comparison of its directly-measured mass with the SM prediction will be a powerful test of the model. An exclusion of the Higgs boson in the predicted mass range by direct searches would decisively point to new physics beyond the SM, for example radiative corrections from supersymmetric particles to M W [6].",

Cosmic rays are rejected with high efficiency using COT hit timing [10]. Electron candidates are required to have a COT track with p T > 18 GeV and an EM calorimeter cluster with E T > 30 GeV and must pass quality requirements on the COT track and the track-cluster matching. Additionally, they must satisfy requirements on the following quantities: pseudorapidity (|\u03b7| < 1) [9], the ratio of cluster energy to track momentum (E/p < 1.6), the ratio of energies detected in the hadronic and EM calorimeters (E Had /E EM < 0.1), and a \u03c7 2 -based difference between the expected and observed transverse shower profiles [4,11]. We impose calorimeter fiduciality requirements on electron candidates to ensure uniformity of response. When selecting the W -boson candidate sample, we suppress the Z-boson background by rejecting events with a second lepton. Events composing control samples of Z-boson candidates are required to have two oppositely-charged leptons satisfying the above criteria and an invariant mass (m \u2113\u2113 ) between 66 and 116 GeV and vector-summed p T (p \u2113\u2113 T ) less than 30 GeV. We define the hadronic recoil u = \u03a3 i E i sin(\u03b8 i )n i , where the sum is performed over calorimeter towers [12], with energy E i , polar angle \u03b8 i , and transverse directions specified by unit vectorsn i . The sum excludes towers that contain energy deposition from the charged lepton(s). From p T conservation, the transverse momentum of the neutrino is inferred as p \u03bd T \u2261 \u2212 p \u2113 T \u2212 u, where p \u2113 T is the vector p T (E T ) of the muon (electron).

A custom Monte Carlo simulation is used to generate templates between 80 GeV and 81 GeV. The simulation includes a boson production and decay model, and a detailed model of detector response. The kinematics of W and Z boson production and decay are modeled using the resbos [13] generator. Using the Z-boson data, we tune the non-perturbative form factor in resbos, which describes the boson p T spectrum at low p T (\u223c5 GeV), and \u03b1 s , which describes the boson p T spectrum at intermediate p T (\u223c15 GeV). The radiation of multiple final-state photons is modeled with photos [14]. The photos QED model was checked with horace [15], which in addition to a leading-logarithm calculation of multiple initialand final-state photons, also performs an exact O(\u03b1) calculation. We use the CTEQ6.6 [16] parton distribution functions (PDFs) of the (anti)proton and verify that the MSTW2008 [17] PDFs give consistent results.

We use a custom implementation of geant4 [20] to model the distributions of electron and photon energy loss in the solenoid coil and energy leakage into the hadronic calorimeter, as a function of E T and incident angle. Using the calibrated tracker momentum scale, we fit the E/p peak in W \u2192 e\u03bd (Fig. 2) and Z \u2192 ee data in bins of E T to determine the electron energy scale and non-linearity of the calorimeter response. We fit the radiative tail of the E/p distribution to tune the amount of simulated material upstream of the COT by 2.6%. The EM calorimeter resolution is parametrized as the quadrature sum of a sampling term (12.6%/ E T /GeV) and a constant term \u03ba = (0.68 \u00b1 0.05)% applied to the cluster energy. A secondary constant term \u03ba \u03b3 = (7.4 \u00b1 1.8)% is applied only to the energies of bremsstrahlung photons and conversion electrons. We tune \u03ba on the width of the E/p peak in the W \u2192 e\u03bd sample and \u03ba \u03b3 on the width of the mass peak in a Z \u2192 ee subsample where both electrons have E/p > 1.11.",

The unblinded result, M Z = 91 230 \u00b1 30 stat \u00b1 14 syst MeV, is consistent with the world average, providing a stringent cross-check of our EM calorimeter energy scale calibration and electron simulation. Cross-checks of the Z \u2192 ee mass measurements using exclusive subsamples consisting of electrons with E/p > 1.11 and E/p < 1.11 respectively, performed with both calorimetry and tracking, give consistent results. The final determination of the electron energy scale combines the E/p-based calibration with the M Z measurement, taking the correlated uncertainty due to the QED radiative correction into account. The calorimeter towers containing lepton energy depositions are excluded from the calculation of the recoil vector u (i.e. lepton removal). The underlying event energy in these towers is measured using the nearby towers in W -boson data. The u resolution due to the underlying event and additional pp collisions is modeled using data triggered on inelastic pp interactions and random bunch crossings respectively. The p T -imbalance between the p \u2113\u2113 T and u in Z \u2192 \u2113\u2113 events is used to tune the recoil model, which also includes the response to the initial state QCD radiation and its resolution. Cross-checks of the recoil model show good agreement between W -boson data and simulation.",
