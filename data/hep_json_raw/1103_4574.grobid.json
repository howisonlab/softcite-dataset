Tuchming, 18 C. Tully, 66 P.M. Tuts, 68 L. Uvarov, 39 S. Uvarov, 39 S. We present a search for flavor changing neutral currents in decays of top quarks. The analysis is based on a search for tt \u2192 \u2113 \u2032 \u03bd\u2113l+jets (\u2113, \u2113 \u2032 = e, \u00b5) final states using 4.1 fb \u22121 of integrated luminosity of pp collisions at \u221a s = 1.96 TeV. We extract limits on the branching ratio B(t \u2192 Zq) (q = u, c quarks), assuming anomalous tuZ or tcZ couplings. We do not observe any sign of such anomalous coupling and set a limit of B < 3.2% at 95% C.L. Flavor changing neutral currents (FCNC) allow for transitions between quarks of different flavor but same electric charge. FCNC are sensitive indicators of physics beyond the standard model (BSM), because they are suppressed in the standard model (SM).",

            "text": "We investigate channels where the W and Z bosons decay leptonically, as shown in Fig. 1. The u, c, and b quarks subsequently hadronize, giving rise to a final state with three charged leptons (\u2113 = e, \u00b5), an imbalance in momentum transverse to the pp collision axis (E / T , assumed to be from the escaping neutrino in the W \u2192 \u2113\u03bd decay), and jets. This is the first search for FCNC in tt decays with trilepton final states. This mode provides a distinct signature with low background, albeit at the cost of statistical power. The first measurement (b \u2192 s\u03b3) was published in 1995 by the CLEO Collaboration [9]. Numerous studies have been done since then to search for FCNC processes in meson decays, i.e., b \u2192 Zs in B + \u2192 K * + \u2113 + \u2113 \u2212 [10][11][12], B \u2192 K * \u03bd\u03bd [13], and [14,15] or s \u2192 Zd in K + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03bd\u03bd [16]. Using the D + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 final state in 1.3 fb \u22121 of integrated luminosity, the D0 Collaboration has set the best branching ratio (B) limits on the FCNC c \u2192 Zu process at B(D + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) < 3.9\u00d710 \u22126 at 90% C.L. [17]. There are theoretical arguments as to why top quark decays may be the best way to study flavor violating couplings of mass-dependent interactions [18,19]. FCNC tqZ and tq\u03b3 couplings have been studied by the CERN e + e \u2212 Collider (LEP), DESY ep Collider (HERA), and Fermilab pp Collider (Tevatron) experiments [20][21][22][23][24]. The D0 Collaboration has recently published limits on the branching ratios determined from FCNC gluon-quark couplings using single top quark final states [25]. The 95% C.L. upper limit on the branching ratio of t \u2192 Zq from the CDF Collaboration uses 1.9 fb \u22121 of integrated luminosity, assumes a top quark mass of m t = 175 GeV and uses the measured cross section of \u03c3 tt = 8.8 \u00b1 1.1 pb [24]. This result excludes branching ratios of B(t \u2192 Zq) > 3.7%, with an expected limit of 5.0% \u00b1 2.2%. To obtain these results, CDF exploited the two lepton plus four jet final state. This signature occurs when one of the pair-produced top quarks decays via FCNC to Zq, followed by the decay Z \u2192 ee or Z \u2192 \u00b5\u00b5. The other top quark decays to W b, followed by the hadronic decay of the W boson. This dilepton signature suffers from large background, but profits from more events relative to the trilepton final states investigated in this Letter.",

A small background contribution is expected from processes such as W +jets and SM tt production. The W Z, ZZ, and tt backgrounds are estimated from the simulation, while the V +jets and Z\u03b3 backgrounds are estimated using data-  driven methods. One or more jets in V +jets events can be misidentified as a lepton from W or Z boson decays. To estimate this contribution, we define a false lepton category for electrons and muons. A false electron is required to have most of its energy deposited in the electromagnetic part of the calorimeter and satisfy calorimeter isolation criteria for electrons, but have a shower shape inconsistent with that of an electron. A muon candidate is categorized as false if it fails isolation criteria, as determined from the total p T of tracks located within a cone \u2206R = 0.5 around the muon. These requirements ensure that the false lepton is either a misidentified jet or a lepton from the semi-leptonic decay of a heavy-flavor quark. Using a sample of data events, collected using jet triggers with no lepton requirement, we measure the ratio of misidentified leptons passing two different selection criteria, false lepton and signal lepton, as a function of p T in three bins, n jet = 0, 1, and \u2265 2, where n jet is the number of jets. We then select a sample of Z boson decays with at least one additional false lepton candidate for each final state signature.

As a result the Z\u03b3 process is a background to the final state signatures with W \u2192 e\u03bd decays. To estimate the contribution from this background, we model the kinematics of these events using the Z\u03b3 NLO MC simulation [35]. We scale this result by the rate at which a photon is misidentified as an electron. This rate is obtained using a data sample of Z \u2192 \u00b5\u00b5 events containing a radiated photon, as it offers an almost background-free source of photons. The invariant mass M (\u00b5\u00b5\u03b3) is reconstructed and required to be consistent with the Z boson mass. The Z \u2192 \u00b5\u00b5 decay is chosen to avoid any ambiguity when assigning the electromagnetic shower to the final state photon candidate. As the Z\u03b3 NLO MC does not model recoil jets, pythia MC samples are used to estimate Z\u03b3 background jet multiplicities and E / T . As the pythia samples do not contain events with final state radiation, we find the fraction of Z\u03b3 events in data and pythia MC that pass our E / T cut and take the difference as a systematic uncertainty.",

In events with n jet = 0, this variable is not defined. In events with one jet, we calculate the invariant mass, m reco t \u2261 M (Z, jet), from the 4-momenta of the jet and the identified Z boson, to reconstruct m t . For events with two or more jets, we use the jet that gives a m reco t closest to m t = 172.5 GeV. The m reco t distribution is shown in Fig. 4(a). In Fig. 4(b), we present a 2-dimensional distribution of m reco t and H T . None of the observables in Figs. 2 -4 show evidence for the presence of FCNC in the decay of tt. We therefore set 95% C.L. limits on the branching ratio B(t \u2192 Zq). The limits are derived from 10 bins of the H T distributions for n jet = 0, 1, and \u2265 2. For the channels with n jet = 1    When calculating the limit on the branching ratio we consider several sources of systematic uncertainty. The systematic uncertainties for lepton-identification efficiencies are 15% (eee), 11% (ee\u00b5), 9% (\u00b5\u00b5e), and 12% (\u00b5\u00b5\u00b5). The systematic uncertainty assigned to the choice of PDF is 5%. In addition, we assign 9% systematic uncertainty on \u03c3 tt [31]. This includes the dependence on the uncertainty of m t [32]. Furthermore, m t is changed from 172.5 GeV to 175 GeV in tt MC samples with the difference in the result taken as a systematic uncertainty. We vary the v tqZ and a tqZ couplings as explained before Eq. 2, resulting in a 1% systematic uncertainty on the acceptance. Due to the uncertainty on the theoretical cross sections for W Z and ZZ production, we assign a 10% [36] systematic uncertainty to each. The major sources of systematic uncertainty on the estimated V +jets contribution arise from the E / T requirement and the statistics in the multijet sample used to measure the lepton-misidentification rates. These effects are estimated independently for each signature and found to be between 20% and 30%. The systematic uncertainty on the Z\u03b3 background is estimated to be 40% and 58% for the eee and \u00b5\u00b5e channels, respectively. Uncertainties on jet energy scale, jet energy resolution, jet reconstruction, and identification efficiency are estimated by varying parameters within their experimental uncertainties. For n jet = 0 the uncertainty is found to be 1%, for n jet = 1 it is 5%, and for n jet \u2265 2 it is 20%. The measured integrated luminosity has an uncertainty of 6.1% [37].",

The test statistic is calculated as a joint log-likelihood ratio (LLR) obtained by summing LLR values over the bins of the H T distributions. Systematic uncertainties are incorporated via  Gaussian smearing of Poisson probabilities for signal and backgrounds in the pseudo-experiments. All correlations between signal and backgrounds are maintained. To reduce the impact of systematic uncertainties on the sensitivity of the analysis, the individual signal and background contributions are fitted to the data, by allowing a variation of the background (or signal+background) prediction, within its systematic uncertainties [39]. The likelihood is constructed via a joint Poisson probability over the number of bins in the calculation, and is a function of scaling factors for the systematic uncertainties,  which are given as Gaussian constraints associated with their priors.",
