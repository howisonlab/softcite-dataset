            "text": "The study of heavy flavour (charm and beauty) production in proton-proton collisions at LHC (Large Hadron Collider) energies provides an important test of perturbative QCD (pQCD) calculations [1,2] in a new energy domain, where unprecedented small Bjorken-x (momentum fraction) values are probed. In the rapidity region 2.5 < y < 4, charm (beauty) production at \u221a s = 7 TeV is expected to be sensitive to x values down to about 6 \u2022 10 \u22126 (2 \u2022 10 \u22125 ). Important progress has been achieved in the understanding of heavy flavour production at lower energies. In earlier measurements, the beauty production cross section in pp collisions at \u221a s = 1.8 TeV measured by the CDF and D0 experiments [3,4] at the FNAL Tevatron, was found to be higher than Next-to-Leading Order (NLO) pQCD predictions [1]. More recent results from the CDF Collaboration [5], for pp collisions at \u221a s = 1.96 TeV, are described well by Fixed Order Next-to-Leading Log (FONLL) [6,7] and NLO [8] pQCD calculations. The charm production cross section measured at the FNAL Tevatron [9] is also well reproduced by FONLL [10] and GM-VFN [11] calculations within experimental and theoretical uncertainties, although at the upper limit of the calculations. The PHENIX and STAR Collaborations [12,13] at the RHIC (Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider) measured the production of muons and electrons from heavy flavour decays in pp collisions at \u221a s = 0.2 TeV. The upper limit of FONLL pQCD calculations [14] is consistent with the measurement of electrons from heavy flavour decays in the mid-rapidity region, while in the forward rapidity region the production of muons from heavy flavour decays is \u2729 \u00a9 CERN for the benefit of the ALICE Collaboration. underestimated by the model calculations. Furthermore, at LHC energies, the ATLAS [15], LHCb [16] and CMS [17,18] Collaborations reported on the measurement of beauty production in pp collisions at \u221a s = 7 TeV. The results are consistent with NLO pQCD calculations within uncertainties. A similar agreement with FONLL calculations is also observed for mid-rapidity electrons and muons from heavy flavour decays, measured by the ATLAS experiment [19] in pp collisions at \u221a s = 7 TeV. In this respect, it is particularly interesting to perform the measurement of heavy flavour decay muon production in the forward rapidity region at the LHC and compare it with theoretical models. The investigation of heavy flavour production in pp collisions also constitutes an essential baseline for the corresponding measurements in heavy ion collisions. In the latter, heavy quarks are produced at early stages of the collision and then experience the full evolution of the extremely hot and dense, strongly interacting medium [20,21]. The modification of the heavy flavour transverse momentum distributions measured in heavy ion collisions with respect to those measured in pp collisions is considered as a sensitive probe of this medium [22,23].",

Section 3 is devoted to the analysis strategy: event and track selection, background subtraction, corrections, normalization and determination of systematic uncertainties.

Two stations of trigger chambers equipped with two planes of Resistive Plate Chambers each are located downstream of the tracking system, behind a 1.2 m thick iron wall of 7.2 \u03bb I . The latter absorbs most of the hadrons that punch through the front absorber, secondary hadrons produced inside the front absorber and escaping it and low momentum muons (p < 4 GeV/c). The spatial resolution of the trigger chambers is better than 1 cm and the time resolution is about 2 ns. Details concerning track reconstruction can be found in [28,29].",

The MB trigger is defined as a logical OR between the requirement of at least one hit in the SPD and a hit in one of the two VZERO scintillator arrays. It also asks for a coincidence between the signals from the two beam counters, one on each side of the interaction point, indicating the passage of bunches. This corresponds to at least one charged particle in 8 units of pseudorapidity. The logic of the \u03bc-MB trigger requires hits in at least three (out of four possible) trigger chamber planes. The estimate of the muon transverse momentum is based on the deviation of the measured track with respect to a straight line coming from the interaction point, in the bending plane (plane measuring the position along the direction perpendicular to the magnetic field). By applying a cut on this deviation, tracks above a given p t threshold are selected. The p t threshold allows the rejection of soft background muons mainly coming from pion and kaon decays, and also to limit the muon trigger rate when high luminosities are delivered at the interaction point. In the considered data taking period, the p t trigger threshold was set to its minimum value of about 0.5 GeV/c and the corresponding muon trigger rate varied between about 40 and 150 Hz. The instantaneous luminosity at the ALICE interaction point was limited to 0.6-1.2 \u2022 10 29 cm \u22122 s \u22121 by displacing the beams in the transverse plane by 3.8 times the r.m.s. of their transverse profile.

This was achieved by using the timing information from the VZERO and by exploiting the correlation between the number of hits and track segments in the SPD. The accepted events have at least one interaction vertex reconstructed from hits correlation in the two SPD layers. The corresponding total number of tracks reconstructed in the muon spectrometer is 7.8 \u202210 6 . Various selection cuts were applied in order to reduce the background contributions in the data sample. Tracks were required to be reconstructed in the geometrical acceptance of the muon spectrometer, with \u22124 < \u03b7 < \u22122.5 and 171 \u2022 < \u03b8 abs < 178 \u2022 , \u03b8 abs being the track polar angle measured at the end of the absorber. These two cuts reject about 9% of tracks. Then, the track candidate measured in the muon tracking chambers was required to be matched with the corresponding one measured in the trigger chambers. This results in a very effective rejection of the hadronic component that is absorbed in the iron wall.

Indeed, due to the multiple scattering in the front absorber, the DCA distribution of tracks coming from the interaction vertex is expected to be described by a Gaussian function whose width depends on the absorber material and is proportional to 1/p. The beam-induced background does not follow this trend and can be rejected by applying a cut on p \u00d7 DCA at 5\u03c3 , where \u03c3 is extracted from a Gaussian fit to the p \u00d7 DCA distribution measured in two regions in \u03b8 abs , corresponding to different materials in the front absorber.

In order to avoid fluctuations due to the lack of statistics in the high p t region in the Monte Carlo generators, the reconstructed p t distribution of decay muons, obtained after all selection cuts are applied (Section 3.1), is fitted using dN dp t The subtracted p t distribution is the mean of the p t distributions from the PYTHIA and PHOJET event generators. The total systematic uncertainty due to this procedure includes contributions from the model input and the transport code (GEANT3 [31,32]). The former takes into account the shape and normalization of the p t distribution of decay muons, and the observed difference in the K \u00b1 /\u03c0 \u00b1 ratio as a function of p t in the mid-rapidity region [38] between ALICE data and simulations. The results show that both PYTHIA (tune Perugia-0) and PHOJET underestimate this ratio by about 20%. The corresponding uncertainty due to this difference between data and simulations is propagated to the muon yield in the forward rapidity region. The effect of the transport code is estimated by varying the yield of secondary muons within 100% in such a way to provide a conservative estimate of the systematic uncertainty on the secondary particle production in the front absorber. The systematic uncertainty from the model input varies from about 7% to 2% as y increases from 2.5 to 4, independently of p t , while the one from the transport code depends both on y and p t and ranges from 4% (3.7 < y < 4) to a maximum of 34% (p t = 2 GeV/c and 2.5 < y < 2.8).

            "text": "The extracted yields of muons from heavy flavour decays are corrected for acceptance, reconstruction and trigger efficiencies by means of a simulation modelling the response of the muon spectrometer. The procedure is based on the generation of a large sample of muons from beauty decays by using a parameterization of NLO pQCD calculations [29]. The tracking efficiency takes into account the status of each electronic channel and the residual mis-alignment of detection elements. The evolution of the tracking efficiency over time is controlled by weighting the response of electronic channels as a function of time. The typical value of muon tracking efficiency is about 93%. The efficiencies of the muon trigger chambers are obtained directly from data [28] and employed in the simulations. The typical value of such efficiencies Table 1 Systematic uncertainties introduced by the procedure used for the subtraction of decay muons. MC and transport refer to the systematic uncertainty due to model input and transport code, respectively. See the text for details. is about 96%. Fig. 2 shows the resulting acceptance and efficiency ( A \u00d7 \u03b5) as a function of generated p t . The global A \u00d7 \u03b5 increases significantly up to about 2 GeV/c and tends to saturate at a value close to 90%. The systematic uncertainty corresponding to the sensitivity of A \u00d7 \u03b5 on the input p t and y distributions was estimated by comparing the results with those from a simulation using muons from charm decays. This amounted to less than 1% and was neglected. The accuracy in the detector modelling introduces a systematic uncertainty estimated to be 5%, by comparing the values of trigger and tracking efficiencies extracted from data and simulations [28]. The distortion of the measured p t distribution, dominated in the high p t region by the effect of residual mis-alignment, is also corrected for by introducing in the simulation a residual misalignment of the same order of magnitude as in the data. However, this residual mis-alignment is generated randomly. A p t dependent relative systematic uncertainty on the muon yield of 1% \u00d7 p t (in GeV/c) is considered in order to take into account the differences between the real (unknown) residual mis-alignment and the simulated one. This is a conservative value determined by comparing the reconstructed p t distribution with or without including the residual mis-alignment.",
