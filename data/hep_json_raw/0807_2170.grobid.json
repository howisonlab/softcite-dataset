The measured branching fraction is (2.44 \u00b1 0.22 \u00b1 0.20)\u00d710 \u22125 and the charge asymmetry is A = 0.022 \u00b1 0.085 \u00b1 0.016.

            "text": "The study of exclusive B meson decays to charmonium has played an important role in exploring CPviolation [1]. Among these, Cabibbo-suppressed charmonium decays provide an opportunity to understand nonleptonic B decays [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9] and can be studied at the B factories which, due to their high integrated luminosities, overcome the suppression factor. At quark level, the decay B \u2212 \u2192 \u03c8(2S)\u03c0 \u2212 [10] proceeds primarily via a b \u2192 ccd transition; the leading contribution to this decay comes from the Cabibbo-and color-suppressed tree diagram shown in Fig. 1. The measurement of the branching fraction for the decay B \u2212 \u2192 \u03c8(2S)\u03c0 \u2212 , which has not been observed so far, is important for detailed studies of the b \u2192 ccd transition.",

However, the penguin amplitude in the b \u2192 ccd transition contains a complex phase due to one of the Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix elements [12], V td , and therefore, if penguin or new physics contributions are substantial, direct CP violation may occur in B \u2212 \u2192 \u03c8(2S)\u03c0 \u2212 [13,14].",

All these subdetectors are located inside a superconducting solenoid coil that provides a 1.5 T magnetic field. An iron flux-return yoke located outside the coil is instrumented to detect K 0 L mesons and to identify the muons (KLM). The data sample used in this analysis is collected with two different detector configurations. The first sample of 152 \u00d7 10 6 BB events is collected with a 2.0 cm radius beam-pipe and a 3-layer SVD, while the remaining 505 \u00d7 10 6 BB events are collected with a 1.5 cm radius beam-pipe, a 4-layer SVD and a smaller-cell inner drift chamber [17].

A correction factor for the \u2206M requirement is determined from the B \u2212 \u2192 \u03c8(2S)K \u2212 sample and is estimated by taking the ratio of yields from data and MC for tight (0.578 GeV/c 2 < \u2206M < 0.598 GeV/c 2 ) and loose (0.570 GeV/c 2 < \u2206M < 0.610 GeV/c 2 ) selection cuts.

Here the systematic error includes contributions from the uncertainty on the yield extraction method, charge asymmetry in the pion identification efficiency as well as a possible detector bias and a possible difference between B + and B \u2212 signal shape parameters. Among all these uncertainties, the only nonnegligible one is a possible detector bias: it is estimated to be 0.016 from a study of B \u2212 \u2192 J/\u03c8K \u2212 . We also measure the ratio of B(B \u2212 \u2192 \u03c8(2S)\u03c0 \u2212 ) and B(B \u2212 \u2192 \u03c8(2S)K \u2212 ).

The background estimation is performed using the \u2206M data sideband defined as 0.51 GeV/c 2 < \u2206M < 0.57 GeV/c 2 and 0.61 GeV/c 2 < \u2206M < 0.67 GeV/c 2 .
