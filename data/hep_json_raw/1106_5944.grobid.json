            "text": "Measurements of particle production at very small angles with respect to the proton beam direction (forward direction) in positron-proton collisions are important for the understanding of the fragmentation of the proton remnant. These measurements also provide important constraints for the modelling of the high energy air showers and thereby are very valuable for the understanding of high energy cosmic ray data [1,2]. The H1 and ZEUS experiments at the e \u00b1 p collider HERA have published several analyses on the production of forward protons and neutrons which carry a large fraction of the longitudinal momentum of the incoming proton [3][4][5][6][7]. These measurements probe different mechanisms related to the baryon production in forward direction, such as elastic scattering of the proton, diffractive dissociation, pion exchange and string fragmentation. In particular, these measurements test the hypothesis of limiting fragmentation [8,9], according to which, in the high-energy limit, the cross section for the inclusive production of particles in the target fragmentation region is independent of the incident projectile energy. This hypothesis implies, that in deepinelastic scattering (DIS) forward particle production cross sections are independent of the Bjorken-x and the virtuality of the exchanged photon Q 2 . The measurement of the photon production in the forward direction can provide new input to the understanding of proton fragmentation, and is complementary to forward baryon measurements. The production of photons and \u03c0 0 mesons in the proton fragmentation region has been studied inpp and pp collisions at SPS and the LHC colliders [10,11]. The analysis presented here is the first measurement of very forward photons in DIS e + p collisions at HERA. The photons are detected at very small angles below 0.75 mrad with respect to proton beam direction. It relies on the upgraded H1 Forward Neutron Calorimeter (FNC) which includes an electromagnetic section.",

The z coordinate of the primary event vertex is required to be within \u00b135 cm of the nominal position of the interaction point. The hadronic final state is reconstructed using an energy flow algorithm which combines charged particles measured in the tracker with information from the SpaCal and LAr calorimeters [18,19]. To suppress events with hard initial state radiation, as well as events originating from none + p interactions, the quantity E \u2212 p z , summed over all reconstructed final state particles including the positron, is required to lie between 35 GeV and 70 GeV. This quantity, which uses the energy and longitudinal momentum component of each final state particle, is expected to be twice the electron beam energy for fully contained events. In addition, events are restricted to the kinematic range 6 < Q 2 < 100 GeV 2 and 0.05 < y < 0.6. These variables are reconstructed using a technique which optimises the resolution throughout the measured y range, exploiting information from both the scattered positron and the hadronic final state [17].

These models are based on Regge theory [38], the Gribov's Reggeon calculus [37], and on perturbative QCD. They use an unitarisation procedure to reconstruct amplitudes for exclusive processes and to determine the total and elastic cross sections. Central elements of these models are the production of mini-jets and the formation of colour strings that fragment into hadrons. Whereas the Regge-Gribov approximation is applied to hadrons as interacting objects in the case of QGSJET and SIBYLL, it is extended to include partonic constituents in EPOS. Furthermore the models differ in the treatment of saturation effects at high parton densities at small x and in the treatment of the hadronic remnants in collisions. The programs are interfaced with the PHOJET program [40] for the simulation of e + p interactions.",

This leads to an uncertainty of 1% on the cross section measurement at low energies, increasing to 35% for the largest x L values. The acceptance of the FNC calorimeter is defined by the interaction point and the geometry of the HERA magnets and is determined using MC simulations. The uncertainty of the impact position of the photon on the FNC is due to beam inclination and the uncertainty on the FNC position. It is estimated to be 5 mm. This results in uncertainties on the FNC acceptance determination of up to 15% for the x L distributions and up to 60% for the p lead T distribution. These effects are strongly correlated between measurement bins. For the Q 2 and x Bj measurements, these effects lead to normalisation uncertainty of approximately 7%.",

The measurement of forward photons allows a test of the limiting fragmentation hypothesis, according to which the production of forward photons in DIS is insensitive to Q 2 and x Bj . To investigate this prediction, the ratio of the forward photon production cross section to the inclusive DIS cross section is measured as a function of Q 2 and x Bj (Table 2 and Fig. 6). Within the uncertainties the fraction of DIS events with forward photons is independent from Q 2 and x Bj in agreement with the limiting fragmentation hypothesis. A similar conclusion was obtained in the earlier H1 analysis of forward neutron production [7]. The LEPTO and CDM predictions also included in Fig. 6 display a significant difference in normalisation compared to data as well as a slight dependence as a function of Q 2 and x Bj .",
