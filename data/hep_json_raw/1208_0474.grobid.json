The existence of the spin-exotic \u03c0 1 (1600) resonance in the \u03c1\u03c0 decay channel is studied for the first time in COMPASS in both decay modes of the diffractively produced (3\u03c0)",

We find the neutral versus charged mode results in good agreement with expectations from isospin symmetry. Both, the intensities and the relative phases to well-known resonances, are consistent for the neutral and the charged decay modes of the (3\u03c0) \u2212 system. The status on the search for the spin-exotic \u03c0 1 (1600) resonance produced on a proton target is discussed.",

The experimental observation of such a resonance beyond the simple Constituent Quark Model would be a fundamental confirmation of Quantum Chromodynamics, allowing for and predicting such spin-exotic mesons according to various models, for a recent overview, see e.g. [1]. The observations in the \u03c1\u03c0 decay channel analysed in 3\u03c0 final states are still controversially discussed in the community. Especially the resonant nature of the observed signals in the exotic J PC = 1 \u2212+ partial-wave reported by the E852 at BNL and the VES experiments [2,3] in diffractively produced \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 final states are questioned, in later publications previous conclusions were withdrawn [4] and re-analyses of the (3\u03c0) \u2212 system in the charged and neutral decay modes led to opposite conclusions [5]. One may get a hint at this controversy looking at [6].",

The present results from the high statistics 2008 proton target data discussed here were obtained employing the same PWA model as in [7]. The results are consistent with the previous observations. Apart of the prominent and established resonances a 1 (1260), a 2 (1320), \u03c0 2 (1670), and \u03c0(1800), a 4 (2040), we observe an exotic signal in the 1 \u2212+ wave at around 1.6 GeV/c 2 that shows a clean, rapid phase motion with respect to well-known resonances.

All resonances observed (Figs. 2, 3) are similarly observed for both wave-sets, the results are robust and do not change with the wave-set extension. This holds also for the exotic wave, for which the results are shown for the neutral mode data for both PWA results, using the wave-set of 42 partial-waves (black points in Fig. 4, right) or the extended one comprising 53 waves (re-displayed again as red points in Fig. 4, right). Both, the signal at about 1.6 GeV/c 2 as well as as the phase motion are observed rather unaffected for both wave-sets.",

Moreover, the charged data of huge statistics allow for much deeper studies in terms of a two dimensional ansatz, fitting the data simultaneously in bins of the (3\u03c0) \u2212 mass and the momentum transfer t allows for deeper understanding of e.g. backgrounds from the Deck effect.",
