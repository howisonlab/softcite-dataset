            "text": "One of the main objectives of the NA61/SHINE experiment at the CERN SPS is to study properties of strongly interacting matter. This paper presents new results on observables relevant for this part of the NA61/SHINE programme. These include the first ever measurements of \u03c6 meson production in p+p collisions at 40 and 80 GeV, and most detailed ever experimental data at 158 GeV. This contribution demonstrates the superior accuracy of the present dataset with respect to existing measurements. The comparison of p+p to Pb+Pb collisions shows a non-trivial system size dependence of the longitudinal evolution of hidden strangeness production, contrasting with that of other mesons. Furthermore, proton density fluctuations are investigated as a possible order parameter of the second order phase transition in the neighbourhood of the critical point (CP) of strongly interacting matter. An intermittency analysis is performed of the proton second scaled factorial moments in transverse momentum space. A previous analysis of this sort revealed significant power-law fluctuations for the \"Si\"+Si system at 158A GeV measured by the NA49 experiment. The fitted power-law exponent was consistent within errors with the theoretically expected critical value, a result suggesting a baryochemical potential in the vicinity of the CP of about 250 MeV [24]. The analysis will now be extended to NA61/SHINE systems of similar size, Be+Be and Ar+Sc, at 150A GeV. Finally, spectator-induced electromagnetic (EM) effects on charged meson production are being studied and bring information on the space-time position of the pion formation zone, which appears to be much closer to the spectator system for faster pions than for slower ones. On that basis, we demonstrate that the longitudinal evolution of the system at CERN SPS energies may be interpreted as a pure consequence of local energymomentum conservation.",

Its strong interactions programme is a continuation and extension of the NA49 experiment [2], following NA49's discovery of the onset of deconfinement in Pb+Pb collisions at 30A GeV beam momentum [3,4]. NA61/SHINE performs the first two-dimensional scan of the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter (SIM) by varying the momentum and size of the colliding nuclei, in search for the critical point of SIM and to study properties of the onset of deconfinement. Of interest to this programme are thus strangeness production (section 2), fluctuations of baryon density (section 3) and space-time properties of the medium created in heavy ion collisions (section 4  Figure 1. Schematic layout of the NA61/SHINE detector system [1] (horizontal cut in the beam plane, not to scale). Also outlined are the coordinate system used in the experiment and the configuration of beam detectors used with secondary proton beams for p+p interactions for which \u03c6 meson production results are presented.",

Model predictions in Fig. 2 are normalized to the integral of the data in each rapidity bin to focus only on shape comparison. One sees that Pythia describes well the shape, while the spectra from UrQMD are too hard and those from Epos too soft.  Having the double differential spectra it is possible to calculate the single differential spectra of rapidity integrated over p T by summation of the measured p T region and extrapolation to large p T . The latter is done using a thermally motivated fit function p T e m T /T (thick curves in Fig. 2). The unmeasured tail contribution is smaller than 1% for all y bins in Fig. 2.",

The figure also shows a comparison of \u03c6 yields with models, including the hadron resonance gas (HRG [16]) statistical model. It is apparent that while Epos describes the data reasonably well (although the rise with collision energy is too fast), all other models fail with UrQMD underestimating and HRG overestimating the yield by about a factor of 2. Figure 5 demonstrates the enhancement of strange meson production in Pb+Pb collisions compared to p+p reactions. Data on \u03c6 in Pb+Pb and other mesons in both systems come from Refs. [3,4,17,18]. Multiplicities of strange mesons are divided by those of pions to take out the \"trivial\" effect of the size of the colliding system. In case of the \u03c6, the mean total yield of pions is used which was calculated as Ref. [17]: double ratio (Pb+Pb) / (p+p) Figure 5.

Widths are derived from single or double Gaussian fits depending on the particle species. It is striking that all particles in both colliding systems, except \u03c6 in Pb+Pb follow the same trend: \u03c3 y is proportional to y beam in the studied range, with the same slope of increase with energy.

Such kaons no longer contribute to the signal peak in the invariant mass spectrum. It is more likely to take place for slow kaons (i.e. those coming from low rapidity \u03c6 mesons), which travel longer through the fireball. Therefore, the \u03c6 rapidity spectrum gets depleted and this loss is the highest at midrapidity and decreases with increasing y values. So the spectrum becomes wider due to the rescattering.

Lines are fitted to points to guide the eye. effect should increase with the collision energy, because the higher the energy, the larger and denser the fireball. Moreover, it is natural to assume that the effect would be much stronger in a quark gluon plasma, than in a purely hadronic medium.

It was explained by the spectator-induced electromagnetic (EM) effects assuming that the distance d E between the pion formation zone and the spectator was of the order of 3 fm [27]. Taking together results of three similar analyses of EM effects in three different data sets on Au+Au and Pb+Pb collisions [26,28,29], the dependence of d E on pion rapidity, shown in Fig. 8(b), was obtained [30].

They include the first ever differential measurements of \u03c6 meson production in p+p collisions at 40 and 80 GeV beam momentum and the first double-differential measurements at 158 GeV. These results were compared to world data on p+p collisions showing consistency and EPJ Web of Conferences 182, 02082 (2018) https://doi.org/10.1051/epjconf/201818202082 ICNFP 2017 EPJ Web of Conferences superior accuracy of the new measurements. It was also demonstrated that none of the considered models is able to describe all the properties of \u03c6 production in the measured reactions. Finally, the comparison of p+p to Pb+Pb collisions shows a non-trivial system size dependence of the longitudinal evolution of hidden strangeness production, contrasting with that of other mesons. The latter observation emphasizes the importance of the analysis of Be+Be, Ar+Sc and Xe+La data collected by NA61/SHINE. Regarding the search for the QCD critical point, it was shown that there is some evidence from NA49 for intermittency in \"Si\"+Si collisions at 158A GeV and none detected by NA49 in \"C\"+C, Pb+Pb, nor by NA61/SHINE in Be+Be interactions at the same energy. The analysis in Ar+Sc reactions is ongoing.",
