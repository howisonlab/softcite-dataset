The structure functions F p 2 and F d 2 are determined using a parameterization of existing data for the longitudinal-to-transverse virtual-photon absorption cross-section ratio. The HERMES results provide data in the ranges 0.006 \u2264 x \u2264 0.9 and 0.1 GeV 2 \u2264 Q 2 \u2264 20 GeV 2 , covering the transition region between the perturbative and the non-perturbative regimes of QCD in a so-far largely unexplored kinematic region. They are in agreement with existing world data in the region of overlap. The measured cross sections are used, in combination with data from other experiments, to perform fits to the photon-nucleon cross section using the functional form of the ALLM model. The deuteron-to-proton cross-section ratio is also determined.",

For a review on the subject see for example [1]. In lowest order perturbation theory, scattering of charged leptons l off nucleons N proceeds via the exchange of a neutral boson (\u03b3 * , Z 0 ). At the HERMES lepton-nucleon centre-of-mass energy of \u221a s = 7.2 GeV, contributions from Z 0 -exchange to the cross section can be neglected. Therefore, only the electromagnetic interaction in the approximation of",

In the Quark-Parton Model (QPM), the DIS process is viewed as the incoherent superposition of elastic lepton scattering from quasi-free point-like quarks of any flavor q. The variable x can then be interpreted as the fraction of the longitudinal nucleon momentum carried by the struck quark in a frame where the nucleon moves with infinite momentum in the direction opposite to that of the virtual photon. In this picture, quark distribution functions f q (x, Q 2 ) describe the number density of quarks of flavor q in a fast-moving nucleon at a given value of (x, Q 2 ) and experimental values of F 2 (x, Q 2 ) have been used to constrain these. At low values of Q 2 , where this picture of incoherent quasi-free scattering does not apply, phenomenological models have been developed (see e.g. refs. [2] and [3]) to describe the measured structure functions.",

The HERMES experiment [24] at HERA collected a large data set for positron and electron scattering on a variety of nuclear targets, including the proton and deuteron data presented here. In particular, the HERMES data cover the transition region between the perturbative and non-perturbative regimes of QCD in a kinematic region so far largely unexplored by other experiments. In this work, these data are presented together with fits to the world data for the photon-nucleon cross section using the Regge-motivated approach of the ALLM [3,25] model. The paper is organized as follows: the formalism leading to the extraction of the structure function F 2 is briefly reviewed in section 2; section 3 deals with the HERMES experimental arrangement and the data analysis is described in section 4. The systematic uncertainties in the resulting cross sections and cross-section ratios are discussed in section 5. Section 6 offers a discussion of the results and section 7 provides a summary.",

An open-ended storage cell that could be fed with either polarized or unpolarized gas was installed internally to the lepton ring. The HERMES spectrometer, which consisted of two identical halves above and below the electron beam, was a forward spectrometer [24] with multiple tracking stages before and after a 1.5 Tm dipole magnet. It had a geometrical acceptance of \u00b1170 mrad horizontally and \u00b1(40 \u2212 140) mrad vertically for particles originating from the center of the target cell, resulting in polar scattering angles \u03b8 ranging from about 40 to 220 mrad. Particle identification (PID) capabilities were provided by combining the responses of a lead-glass calorimeter, a pre-shower hodoscope (H2), a transition-radiation detector (TRD), and a threshold\u010cerenkov detector that was upgraded to a dual-radiator ring-imaging\u010cerenkov detector (RICH) [29,30] in the year 1998.

The definition of \u03c7 2 takes into account point-by-point statistical and systematic uncertainties. We agree that ideally one should treat the statistical and systematic uncertainties separately, as the latter in most cases are to some degree correlated. However, almost all published data sets just give statistical, total, and normalization uncertainties. For that reason we have used in the fit the total uncertainties per point, plus the overall normalization. Clearly the value of \u03c7 2 is influenced by this, but in practice the influence on the resultant parameters seems minor, see for example ref. [46]. Additionally, for each data set k a normalization parameter \u03bd k is used to describe the normalization of all data points belonging to the data set. Since the normalization parameters are assumed to normalize data within the known normalization uncertainties, they are scaled with these uncertainties and taken into account by a penalty term k \u03bd 2 k to control their variation according to their standard deviations. At each iteration of the \u03c7 2 -minimization, the normalization parameters \u03bd k are analytically determined:",

The analytical determination of the parameters \u03bd k reduces the number of free parameters in the \u03c7 2 -minimization. The separate extraction of all normalization parameters is possible only because the parameters \u03bd k are uncorrelated. At each step eq. (6.3) is substituted into the \u03c7 2 -function, eq. (6.2), and thus the final fit result is obtained by minimizing \u03c7 2 only with respect to the functional parameters. Similar methods are used by others in order to save computing time [47,48]. The fits are performed using the CERNLIB package MINUIT [49] and the MINUIT extension [50]. The resulting fit parameters are listed in table 8 together with the parameters obtained in the previous fits ALLM97 [25] and GD07-P [51] performed on proton data. The difference between GD07-P and GD11-P is the presence of HERMES, JLAB and the combined HERA data in the most recent fit. In ref. [51] the uncertainties were calculated with an UP value [49] equal to 24.7. That identical fit was redone here with the same value of UP=1 as the new fits in order to provide an appropriate comparison of its uncertainties. The ALLM97 fit provided no uncertainties. The uncertainties given in the table for GD07-P, GD11-P, and GD11-D correspond to the diagonal elements of the full covariance matrix, which must be used to calculate uncertainties in F 2 or cross sections. The \u03c7 2 / per degree of freedom for the GD11-P is 0.89 (it is 0.92 for GD07-P), while for the deuteron fit GD11-D it is 0.68. The fitted relative normalization of HERMES proton (deuteron) data is +1.5% (-2.2%), well within the quoted uncertainty of 7.5% (7.6%). Table 9 shows the fitted relative normalizations for all the data sets used in the fit.",

In ref. [51] the uncertainties were calculated with an UP value [49] equal to 24.7. That identical fit was redone here with the same value of UP=1 as the new fits in order to provide an appropriate comparison of its uncertainties. The ALLM97 fit provided no uncertainties. The uncertainties given in the table for GD07-P, GD11-P, and GD11-D correspond to the diagonal elements of the full covariance matrix which must be used to calculate uncertainties in F 2 or cross sections. They can be obtained by contacting the management of the HERMES collaboration: <management@hermes.desy.de>. The parameter \u039b 2 0 has no uncertainty as it is fixed in the fits. In the case of the deuteron fit, the parameters m 2 0 and Q 2 0 had to be fixed in order to obtain a good fit.",
