The particles are assumed to be pair-produced by the decay of a Higgs-like boson with mass between 80 and 140 GeV/c 2 . No excess above the background expectation is observed and limits are set on the production cross-section as a function of the long-lived particle mass and lifetime and of the Higgs-like boson mass.",

Nevertheless, open questions remain, such as the hierarchy problem, the imprecise unification of gauge couplings, and the absence of candidates for dark matter. Considerable efforts have been made to address these issues, resulting in a large variety of models. Supersymmetry (SUSY), in which the strong and electroweak forces are unified at a renormalisation scale near the Planck scale, provides a possible solution for the hierarchy problem; the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) is the simplest, phenomenologically viable realisation of SUSY [1,2].",

Here a Higgs-like boson produced in pp collisions decays into two LLPs (neutralinos), subsequently decaying into three quarks each. The Higgslike particle mass ranges from 80 up to 140 GeV/c 2 , covering the mass of the scalar boson discovered by the ATLAS and CMS experiments [13,14]. The explored LLP lifetime range of 5-100 ps is higher than the typical b hadron lifetime, and corresponds to an average flight distance of up to 30 cm, which is inside the LHCb vertex detector region.

The detector includes a high-precision tracking system consisting of a silicon-strip vertex detector surrounding the pp interaction region (VELO), a large-area silicon-strip detector located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4 Tm, and three stations of silicon-strip detectors and straw drift tubes, placed downstream of the magnet. The tracking system provides a measurement of the momentum, p, of charged particles with a relative uncertainty that varies from 0.5% at low momentum to 1.0% at 200 GeV/c. The minimum distance of a track to a primary vertex (PV), the impact parameter, is measured with a resolution of (15 + 29/ p T ) \u00b5m, where p T is the component of the momentum transverse to the beam, in GeV/c. Different types of charged hadrons are distinguished using information from two ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors. Photons, electrons and hadrons are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillatingpad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter and a hadronic calorimeter. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers. The online event selection is performed by a trigger [17], which consists of a hardware stage, L0, based on information from the calorimeter and muon systems, followed by two software stages, HLT1 and HLT2, which run a simplified version of the offline event reconstruction.",

The uncertainty on the integrated luminosity is 1.7% [33]. As previously stated, the uncertainty on the momentum scale and the invariant mass scale is smaller than 10%. This value is also assumed for the di-LLP mass calibration. To assess the impact on the signal measurement, pseudoexperiments are produced with 10 events of simulated signal added to the background following the nominal signal distribution but with the di-LLP mass value scaled by \u00b110%. The subsequent maximum variation of the fitted number of events is \u00b11.6, for all the signal hypotheses. The uncertainty due to the shape of the background template is obtained by comparing the number of fitted events obtained with the Bkg 1 and Bkg 2 selections. The change is less than one event, for all the signal models. The difference in data and simulation in the di-LLP mass resolution and the statistical precision of the signal templates used in the fit have a negligible effect. Hence, a fit uncertainty of \u00b12 events is considered in the calculation of the cross-section upper limits.",

The efficiency increases with m LLP because more particles are produced in the decay of heavier LLPs. This effect is only partially counteracted by the loss of particles outside of the spectrometer acceptance, which is especially the case with heavier Higgs-like particles. Another competing phenomenon is that the lower boost of heavier LLPs results in a shorter average flight length, i.e. the requirement of a minimum R xy disfavours heavy LLPs. The cut on R xy is more efficient at selecting LLPs with large lifetimes, but for lifetimes larger than \u223c50 ps a portion of the decays falls into the material region and is discarded. Finally, a drop of sensitivity is expected for LLPs with a lifetime close to the b hadron lifetimes, where the contamination from bb events becomes important, especially for low mass LLPs.",
