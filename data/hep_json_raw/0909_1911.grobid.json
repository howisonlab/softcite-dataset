In this paper, the discovery potential of the ATLAS experiment for gluino and stop-based R-hadrons is outlined. A range of final state observables such as high transverse momentum muon-like objects and information on ionization energy loss is used. It is shown that ATLAS would be able to discover such particles at comparatively modest amounts of luminosity (1fb \u22121 ) for masses up to 1 TeV.",

            "text": "The presence (or absence) of massive exotic stable hadrons will be an important observable in the search for and quantification of any new physics processes seen at the LHC. Stable exotic coloured particles are predicted in a range of SUSY scenarios (see, for example, Ref. [1]). Such particles could be copiously produced at the LHC and sensitivity to particle masses substantially beyond those excluded by earlier collider searches ( < \u223c 200 GeV [1]) could be achieved at ATLAS even with rather modest amounts of integrated luminosity (\u223c 1fb \u22121 ) [2]. This paper outlines a strategy for the detection of exotic massive, long-lived hadrons (so-called R-hadrons) formed from either stable gluinos or stops (Rg and R\u02dct-hadrons, respectively). The Rg-hadrons (R\u02dct-hadrons) are considered in the context of a Split-SUSY (stop NLSP/gravitino LSP) scenario [3]. Although this work is performed in the framework of SUSY, the techniques presented here may be used in generic searches for stable heavy exotic hadrons.",

The number of expected pair-production events for 14 TeV protonproton collisions with 1fb \u22121 of integrated luminosity is 2.7 \u00d7 10 5 and 7.8 \u00d7 10 3 for 300 GeV gluino pairs and stop pairs, respectively; for a mass of 1000 GeV, it is 138 and 6, respectively. Production mechanisms of stops and gluinos are illustrated in Figure 1, which shows leading-order Feynman diagrams. The cross section depends principally on the mass of the heavy object under study and not other free SUSY parameters. To complement the signal samples, various background samples were used, each corresponding to an integrated luminosity of at least \u223c 1 fb \u22121 . As the simulated trigger used for this analysis requires a hard muon-like track, only events which could give rise to a high p T -muon (p T > 150 GeV) were simulated. The following processes were considered : leading-order 2-to-2 QCD processes, which include all quark flavours except top ; backgrounds arising from diboson and single boson production, denoted electroweak ; and a sample of tt pair-production events, termed top.",

Following repeated scattering Rg-hadrons and R\u02dct-hadrons not containing an anti-stop should enter the muon system predominantly as baryons. This is due to the occurence of mesonto-baryon conversion processes for which the inverse reaction is suppressed [7]. Antibaryons would be expected to quickly annihilate in matter and R\u02dct-hadrons containing anti-stops would thus largely remain as mesons. In the model used here, charged Rbaryon states are stable and thus are expected to leave tracks in the muon system (although this assumption is now disputed in the case of the Rg-baryons [9]). Also, a substantial rate of events is expected in which a R-hadron appears to possess different values of the electric charge in the inner detector and muon system. While such topologies represent a challenge for track reconstruction software, they also provide observables useful for the discovery and characterisation of R-hadrons (see next section).",
