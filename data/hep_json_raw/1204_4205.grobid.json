In the \u03a5(1S) decays, the identification of \u03b7 b (1S) is confirmed at a \u223c 3\u03c3 level with M (\u03b7 b (1S)) in agreement with its known value.",

            "text": "The spin-dependent interaction between constituents of a composite system is of general interest, from hydrogen and positronium to mesons and baryons. The hyperfine interaction between quarks is one of the most important components of the spin-dependent QCD interaction. It has been studied for charm quarks by measurements of hyperfine splittings between spin-triplet and spin-singlet states, M (n 3 L) \u2212 M (n 1 L), of 1S, 2S, and 1P states of charmonium [1]. For the bottom quarks, measurements have been reported recently for the 1S hyperfine splittings [2] and for the 1P and 2P hyperfine splittings [3] of bottomonium states. While \u03b7 b (1S), the bottomonium ground state, has been identified, the radially excited \u03b7 b (2S) has not been identified so far, and the hyperfine splitting of the bottomonium 2S states, \u2206M hf (2S) \u2261 \u03a5(2S) \u2212 \u03b7 b (2S), is not known. In this letter, we report on the observation of \u03b7 b (2S) in its formation in the radiative decay of \u03a5(2S) and its exclusive decays into twenty-six different final states containing charged light-quark hadrons, pion, kaons, and antiprotons. A similar analysis of \u03a5(1S) decays is made, and it confirms the identification of \u03b7 b (1S).",

Successful identification of \u03b7 b (1S) by BaBar [2], and its confirmation by CLEO [2], was only made possible by detecting the \u223c 920 MeV and \u223c 610 MeV transitions photons in the \"forbidden\" M1 decays \u03a5(3S, 2S) \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7 b (1S). These M1 transitions have zero overlap between the initial and final states in the lowest order. They become finite only because of relativistic and higher-order effects, and theoretical predictions for them are notoriously difficult and unreliable. For example, a recent calculation in the framework of non-relativistic effective field theory of QCD (pN-RQCD) [5] predicted a branching fraction for the decay \u03a5(2S) \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7 b (1S) more than two orders of magnitude larger than that measured by BaBar [2]. In contrast, \"allowed\" M1 transitions, \u03a5(nS) \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7 b (nS) are relatively simple, with the wave function overlaps between the initial and final states being essentially unity. They are therefore very attractive from the theoretical point of view. Since the inclusive radiative transitions are essentially impossible to measure, the only hope is to identify \u03b7 b (nS) in radiative decays of \u03a5(nS) by \"tagging\" \u03b7 b (nS) by their exclusive hadronic decays.",

The detector has a total acceptance of 93% of 4\u03c0 for charged and neutral particles. The photon energy resolution in the central (83% of 4\u03c0) part of the calorimeter is about 2% at E \u03b3 = 1 GeV and about 5% at 100 MeV.

They are required to contain at least 10 MeV of energy, to not contain any of the few known noisy calorimeter cells, and to have a transverse energy distribution consistent with an electromagnetic shower. Analysis of simulated events shows that the largest background to the low energy transition photons comes from calorimeter showers due to the interaction of the final state charged hadrons with detector elements.

For the \u03b7 b , these are listed in Table I. Admittedly, these are still rather crude results, and statistical errors do not represent the uncertainties reliably.

The systematic uncertainties in our results due to other possible sources were taken to be equal to the maximum variations in \u2206M hf and B 1 \u00d7 B 2 found in varying the source parameters from their nominal values. The range of variations for different parameters and the maximum variations observed in \u2206M hf and B 1 \u00d7 B 2 are listed in Table II. The uncertainty in number of \u03a5(nS) produced is estimated to be 2%. Event reconstruction and PID uncertainties vary for the different decay modes. The maximum uncertainties correspond to the largest multiplicity decays. To be conservative, in Table II we assign these maximum uncertainties, 16% for \u03b7 b (1S) and \u03b7 b (2S), also to the sum of all modes. The systematic uncertainties added in quadrature are \u00b12.3 MeV in \u2206M hf (1S) and \u00b12.1 MeV in \u2206M hf (2S), and \u00b125% and \u00b123% in the corresponding B 1 \u00d7 B 2 . Our final results are obtained by adding these in quadrature to the statistical errors in Table I In summary, we have presented evidence for the first successful observation of \u03b7 b (2S), and the hyperfine splitting of the bottomonium 2S state. Unquenched lattice predictions for radial excitations are admittedly not yet very reliable [9][10][11]. The latest of these calculations [12] by the HPQCD Collaboration obtains \u2206M hf (1S) bb = 70 \u00b1 9 MeV, in good agreement with its experimental value, and predicts \u2206M hf (2S) bb = 35 \u00b1 3 MeV [12].",
