During 2011 the LHC provided proton-proton collisions with a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV and heavy ion collisions with a 2.76 TeV per nucleon-nucleon collision energy. The ATLAS trigger is a three level system designed to reduce the rate of events from the 40 MHz nominal maximum bunch crossing rate to the approximate 400 Hz which can be written to offline storage. The ATLAS jet trigger is the primary means for the online selection of events containing jets. Events are accepted by the trigger if they contain one or more jets above some transverse energy threshold. During 2011 data taking the jet trigger was fully efficient for jets with transverse energy above 25 GeV for triggers seeded randomly at Level 1. For triggers which require a jet to be identified at each of the three trigger levels, full efficiency is reached for offline jets with transverse energy above 60 GeV. Jets reconstructed in the final trigger level and corresponding to offline jets with transverse energy greater than 60 GeV, are reconstructed with a resolution in transverse energy with respect to offline jets, of better than 4 % in the central region and better than 2.5 % in the forward direction.",

During the 2011 data taking period, the LHC ran with a bunch spacing of 50 ns providing a nominal rate of 20 MHz, and with a mean of more than 20 separate pp interactions per bunch crossing (known as pile-up) towards the end of data taking. To reduce the rate of events to be read out from the detector to a rate of around 400 Hz which can be written to offline storage, a rejection factor greater than 10 5 is required. This is achieved by the ATLAS trigger [3] which is divided into the Level 1 (L1) trigger and the High Level Trigger (HLT). In 2011 the HLT itself consisted of two levels: Level 2 (L2) followed by the event filter (EF).",

This approach enables the successive identification of potentially interesting features and the early rejection of less interesting events. The L1 trigger runs hardware algorithms over data with reduced spatial granularity from the calorimeter and muon subsystems to identify geometrical regions of interest (RoI) in the detector, containing candidate physical objects which should be examined more closely in subsequent trigger levels. The L1 trigger has a fixed maximum latency of 2.5 \u00b5s, and a rate for accepting events up to 75 kHz. For standard triggers, events with at least one RoI passing the L1 selection are passed to the L2 system, which runs software algorithms on a farm of commodity CPUs. The L2 algorithms have access to the data at the full detector granularity but only from those detector elements that lie within an RoI. The number of processors in the L2 farm and the time taken to process each event provides a limit on the rate at which events can be accepted by the L1 system. Following the L2 processing, all events with RoIs that satisfy a set of predefined selection criteria are passed to the event builder which reads out the detector at full granularity. These fully built events are then processed by the EF, which also consists of a farm of commodity CPUs. The EF farm runs modified versions of the offline reconstruction algorithms, simplified to improve the speed of execution. Although the full event data are available at the EF, for many trigger signatures the EF trigger reconstruction takes place within RoIs for reasons of speed. This is not the case for the jet trigger, for which the whole detector is read out. The rate of L2 accepted events passed to the EF during 2011 was approximately 3 kHz, and the rate at which events were read out for offline storage was approximately 400 Hz. The ATLAS trigger is illustrated in Fig. 1.",

The large RoIs required at L2 to ensure that any jet is completely contained has the unfortunate disadvantage that RoIs may overlap in events with high jet multiplicity, resulting in some parts of the detector being processed multiple times. This can result in jets being fully, or partially reconstructed in several RoIs, which may cause the double counting of energy deposits and jets, which would affect the multi-jet signatures.

Since the offline jet reconstruction also uses topological clusters, this improves the EF jet resolutions with respect to offline reconstruction, although the topological clustering algorithm does add additional processing time to the data preparation stage. The topological clustering algorithm creates clusters of topologically related energy deposits. The algorithm starts with a seed calorimeter cell, with an energy deposit with absolute value greater than four standard deviations above the expected noise. All cells directly neighbouring these seed cells, in all three dimensions, are collected into the cluster. Cells adjacent to the cluster are then added, if they have an energy with an absolute value exceeding the noise by two standard deviations, iterating until all such adjacent cells have been used. Finally, a ring of guard cells is added to complete the cluster. After the initial clusters have been formed, they are analysed to identify local maxima, and split should more than one such maxima be found in a cluster [18].",

The times for each of the data preparation stages and the two jet radii are shown in Fig. 6, for the same 2011 run. For the data retrieval stage, before the topological clustering, two distinct peaks are observed. The first, with a mean around 80 ms, represents the processing of the complete event. The second broader peak, with a mean of approximately 220 ms, is due to an artefact of the trigger processing by the EF farm: each CPU in the EF farm runs a separate instance of the EF software and performs some additional initialisation for the first event each receives, increasing the processing time for the first event processed by each CPU node. The number of events in this second peak then corresponds to the number of individual CPUs in the farm. The most time consuming part of the full EF processing is the topological clustering, with a mean of approximately 170 ms. The jet finding itself is comparatively fast, requiring approximately 7 ms per instance. Due to the different prescales and thresholds used for the triggers for the different jet radii, the event topology and E T spectrum is slightly different for the events processed by each instance of the anti-k t algorithm, resulting in the slightly different distributions seen in Fig. 6c, d. The peaks seen at short times in the topological clustering and R = 0.4 anti-k t jet finding are due to the low threshold EF triggers seeded by the random trigger at L1 which therefore may contain fewer calorimeter cells with significant energy and so do not take as long to process. The anti-k t jet finding using R = 1.0 only processes events seeded by jets found both at L1 and L2, where these jets pass the 95 GeV L2 threshold, so this peak is largely absent in Fig. 6d.",

Figure 7 shows the distribution of R for trigger jets from L1, L2 and the EF. Distributions are shown for each trigger for several different p T ranges such that the trigger in each case is fully efficient. For the L2 and EF R distributions, the agreement between online and offline clearly improves with increasing jet E T . Since the L1 trigger uses only coarse granularity calorimeter information, and quantises the \u03b7 and \u03c6 directions to the nearest 0.2, the resolution in \u03b7 or \u03c6 from L1 would be expected to be approximately 0.06. For similar Gaussian distributed residuals in \u03b7 and \u03c6 this would result in a maximum in the R distribution of around 0.08, as observed in Fig. 7a. Although the L2 trigger operates only within each RoI, it uses calorimeter information at the full detector granularity. Therefore the jet \u03b7 and \u03c6 reconstruction in Fig. 7b for L2 is significantly improved with respect to that seen in Fig. 7a for L1. The EF uses the same topological clustering algorithm and the same jet finding algorithm as the offline reconstruction. This leads to a further improvement in the resolution between the trigger and offline jets for the EF with respect to what is already acheived at L2, and can be seen in Fig. 7c.",

The principle source of difference between the E T of offline and trigger jets in 2011 was the hadronic calibration, which was not applied online in this period. Smaller differences at the different levels arise from the detector granularity at L1, the input objects to the jet algorithms and the L2 algorithms. These differences give rise to shifts and additional resolution smearing of the E T reconstructed in the trigger with respect to that reconstructed offline. The selection efficiencies for the various trigger levels resulting from these shifts and smearing are therefore not step functions when measured as a function of the offline E T . Instead, the efficiency as a function of E T will exhibit a more slowly rising edge as the trigger turns on. This has an impact on ATLAS physics analyses; in general, a steeply rising efficiency near the E T threshold which rapidly approaches a plateau near 100 % efficiency indicates good performance of the trigger. A more slowly rising efficiency, or one which does not saturate near 100 % can be problematic for offline data analysis as it has the potential to introduce large systematic uncertainties in the selection efficiency and background estimates. A more slowly rising edge is expected at L1 due to the poorer E T resolution, arising from the coarse granularity data. Care must therefore be taken to ensure that the L1 efficiency reaches its plateau for E T values below the onset of the rising edges of the L2 and EF efficiency curves. The thresholds for the higher trigger levels therefore impose upper limits on the corresponding L1 thresholds, and so reduce the efficacy of raising these thresholds in order to reduce the rate of L1 accepted events. Because of the steeply falling p T spectrum this implies that more events need to be accepted at L1 to avoid reducing the EF efficiency significantly at higher E T . A more steeply rising efficiency is expected at the EF due to the improved E T resolution and the greater similarity in the reconstruction algorithms used online and offline. To minimise systematic uncertainties associated with the trigger, most ATLAS physics analyses relying on jet triggers require that the offline E T for selected jets lie in the efficiency plateau region, where the efficiency is above 99 %.",

This variation with \u03b7 is largely determined by the detector geometry and the different performance of the respective calorimeter subsystems -notably with larger differences in the transition (crack) regions between the barrel and endcap subsystems, around |\u03b7| \u223c 1.5, which are populated with detector services and around |\u03b7| \u223c 0.8 where there is a 20 % reduction in the depth of active material in the LAr calorimeter with respect to more central pseudorapidities. For the same minimum offline p T requirement, jets at higher \u03b7 values also have higher energy, which may also contribute to the observed differences in the endcap response when compared to more central pseudorapidities. These effects are largely accounted for in full calibration for the offline jets, but not for the trigger jets, where this correction was not applied in 2011. Differences in the detector conditions between online and offline reconstruction, such as information on masked, or inactive front end boards, which is only obtained following the offline calibration, also play a r\u00f4le. This can be seen in the small asymmetry observed between the forward and rear barrel regions for |\u03b7| < 0.6, where the simulation, which includes these effects, broadly follows the trend seen in data, albeit with small quantitative differences. Larger offsets are seen in the crack regions due to the greater energy loss in the additional dead material in front of the calorimeter. These effects, including changes in the detector conditions occurring during data taking, are corrected for in the offline reconstruction using the full calibration.",

This should be taken into account when estimating the resolution. This effect will, however, not be as pronounced as in the case of the similar variation of the offset with \u03b7 Offline , because of the steeply falling p T spectrum, so the shape of the residual distributions will be largely determined by the jets near the p Offline T threshold. Figure 10 shows the resolution versus \u03b7 Offline for the four p T ranges shown earlier. The resolution is generally better in the endcap regions than in the barrel and does not vary greatly between the four p T ranges, although it varies sharply as a function of \u03b7 Offline . The resolution is quite well described by the simulation where, as in data, it does not vary greatly with p T . The large asymmetry in the resolution between the barrel regions at positive and negative \u03b7 due to the detector conditions is approximately reproduced by the simulation. At high p T , the simulation predicts a worse resolution than seen in the data, by up to 0.5 % or slightly higher in some regions. In the more forward directions, the better E T resolution partly results from the larger jet energy relative to jets in the barrel with the same E T . Figure 11 illustrates the resolution as a function of transverse energy in the same four \u03b7 Offline ranges discussed previously. In the barrel region, at low p Offline T , the resolution is approximately constant. The resolution found in collision data is again not fully reproduced by simulation, although the differences found are small, being only around 0.5 % at most. In the crack regions, as might be expected from the larger energy loss indicated by the larger offsets observed earlier, the resolutions are worse than in the barrel or endcaps and show a larger dependence on the p T .",

A mean offset of less than 0.5 % is observed at low p T , increasing to around 1 % at higher p T .

Since the random triggers require no jet selection at either L1 or L2, these EF triggers are unaffected by the coarse resolution and the less steep rising edge seen for the low threshold jet triggers at L1. This allows the triggers to reach their full efficiency at a lower E T than is possible for the chains seeded by an L1 jet trigger. In this case, the lowest threshold trigger, with a transverse energy requirement of 10 GeV, is fully efficient by 25 GeV.

Figure 18 shows this integrated single inclusive jet trigger efficiency, as a function of \u03b7 for the trigger chain consisting of thresholds of 75, 95 and 100 GeV at L1, L2 and the EF, respectively.

These variations are related to the detector geometry and detector conditions, and are very strongly correlated with the offsets observed in the previous section, where for instance, the larger (negative) offset seen in the barrel results in fewer jets passing the trigger threshold.

When searching for final states with large jet multiplicities in the high energy environment of the LHC, the requirement of several jets means that a multi-jet trigger is more likely to remain unprescaled than its single jet counterpart. However, the principal disadvantage of a multi-jet trigger is an overall loss in efficiency due to limitations in both transverse energy and angular resolution at L1 and L2. This loss in efficiency is compounded by the jet multiplicity requirement in the trigger, but is less significant for offline jets when they are geometrically isolated. The primary reasons for these inefficiencies in the trigger are the use of the square sliding window and reduced granularity at L1, and the limited RoI size used for the reconstruction of jets at L2.",

The selection adopted to discriminate the signal process from the background in such searches typically includes requirements on the E T and the scalar sum of transverse momenta of all selected physics objects. Missing transverse momentum triggers [42] can be used in such searches; however, an alternative approach is the use of H T triggers which reconstruct the total scalar sum of jet transverse energy (H T ) in an event at the EF. The H T triggers are useful for physics analyses that study, or search for, events with large overall E T in the final state. In this case, the requirement of large H T can help to control the trigger rate without requiring a very energetic leading jet, although a leading jet with some E T may still be required to seed the reconstruction. Because the resolution of the missing transverse momentum reconstruction in the trigger is poor for small values, using an H T based trigger is a realistic alternative to using a missing transverse momentum trigger for final states where the missing transverse momentum is small. The H T triggers were introduced to the trigger menu in 2011, the primary motivation being the selection of events for searches for SUSY in events with no leptons [43]. Single, and multi-jet H T triggers exist, where the single jet H T triggers are seeded by a standard single inclusive trigger and the multi-jet H T triggers are seeded by a standard multi-jet trigger. These seeding triggers are required since the calculation of H T without such a seeding trigger would require full jet finding in all events, which would be computationally prohibitive in the trigger.",

This is because the choice of the leading jet is primarily a selection on the events from which the jets used in the H T calculation are taken and does not significantly affect the value of H T in that event, whereas the selection of the overall jet threshold used in the definition of H T will change the calculated value of H T . Therefore as long as the leading jet threshold is chosen such that the single inclusive trigger is maximally efficient for the leading jet threshold used in the offline definition of H T then the H T trigger will be maximally efficient given a suitable choice of offline threshold for the remaining jets.",

Such events may not be triggered by standard (R = 0.4) multi-jet triggers, if the jets are too close to one another to be resolved. In such situations, large-R jet triggers are useful. For example, the decay products of a top quark produced with an E T above 300 GeV might be contained within a single jet with about twice the radius of a standard jet. One such ATLAS study involving boosted top quarks where the hadronic decay products can not be resolved as individual jets, is the search for new heavy resonances decaying into tt pairs [44]. Large-R jet triggers are useful in such searches [45,46] and also jet substructure studies [47].",

The single inclusive jet trigger efficiency has a sharper rising edge when applied to the Pythia Dijet sample, in which the jets have most of their energy occupying a narrow cone, than when applied to the Pythia Z \u2192 tt sample, in which the jets are the result of the decay of heavy, boosted objects. The large-R jet trigger has both a sharper rising edge than the standard jet trigger, and similar behaviour for all samples. This suggests that the large-R trigger is less sensitive than the standard jet trigger to the quark or gluon nature of the jets studied. In Fig. 24 the sensitivity of the jet trigger to differences between quark-initiated and gluon-initiated jets is explored further. Since gluon-initiated jets are typically wider than quark-initiated jets, selecting narrower jets with a width [46] w < 0.15, would slightly favour quark-initiated jets from the dijet sample. A slightly sharper rising edge than seen in the inclusive sample is observed. The differences between the efficiencies for the samples with different widths are more distinct for the standard jet trigger, seen in Fig. 24a, than the large-R jet trigger, as shown in Fig. 24b. The performance of the jet trigger in the simulation is seen to be broadly in agreement with data for the large-R jet trigger where the larger jet width selection exhibits a sharper rising edge. The rising edge is considerably less sharp for the standard jet trigger and shows significantly more variability with the properties of the sample. The large-R jet trigger is therefore more robust to changes of the jet width, which is a measure of jet substructure and radiation profiles.",

This behaviour is caused by two effects: firstly by the increased UE particle multiplicity in central collisions, leading to a greater number of jets being reconstructed from underlying-event fluctuations, and secondly by the increased sensitivity of the trigger jets with larger radius parameter to these UE fluctuations.",
