            "text": "Light flavorless hadrons, f, are not entirely understood as qq states. Some states with the same quantum numbers such as the \u03b7 and \u03b7 0 exhibit mixing [1]. Others, such as the f 0 \u00f0500\u00de and the f 0 \u00f0980\u00de, could be mixed qq states, or they could be comprised of tetraquarks [2]. In addition, some states, such as the f 0 \u00f01500\u00de, are discussed as being made solely of gluons [3]. Understanding if the f states are indeed explained by the quark model is crucial to identifying other exotic structures. Previous investigations ofB 0 s andB 0 decays (called genericallyB) into a J=\u03c8 meson and a \u03c0 \u00fe \u03c0 \u2212 [4,5] or K \u00fe K \u2212 [6,7] pair have revealed the presence of several light flavorless meson resonances including the f 0 \u00f0500\u00de and the f 0 \u00f0980\u00de. Use ofB \u2192 J=\u03c8 f decays has been suggested as an excellent way of both measuring mixing angles and discerning if some of the f states are tetraquarks [8,9]. In this Letter the J=\u03c8 \u03c0 \u00fe \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u00fe \u03c0 \u2212 final state is investigated with the aim of seeking additional f states. (Mention of a particular process also implies the use of its charge conjugated decay.)",

One third of the data was acquired at a center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV, and the remainder at 8 TeV. The LHCb detector is a single-arm forward spectrometer covering the pseudorapidity range 2 < \u03b7 < 5, designed for the study of particles containing b or c quarks. The detector includes a high precision tracking system consisting of a silicon-strip vertex detector surrounding the pp interaction region, a large-area silicon-strip detector located upstream of a dipole magnet with a bending power of about 4 Tm, and three stations of silicon-strip detectors and straw drift tubes placed downstream. The combined tracking system provides a momentum measurement with relative uncertainty that varies from 0.4% at 5 GeV to 0.6% at 100 GeV. (We work in units where c \u00bc 1.) The impact parameter (IP) is defined as the minimum track distance with respect to the primary vertex. For tracks with large transverse momentum, p T , with respect to the proton beam direction, the IP resolution is approximately 20 \u03bcm. Charged hadrons are identified using two ring-imaging Cherenkov (RICH) detectors. Photon, electron, and hadron candidates are identified by a calorimeter system consisting of scintillating-pad and preshower detectors, an electromagnetic calorimeter, and a hadronic calorimeter. Muons are identified by a system composed of alternating layers of iron and multiwire proportional chambers.",

We examine the distribution of the helicity angle \u03b8 of the \u03bc \u00fe with respect to theB direction in the J=\u03c8 rest frame, after correcting for the angular acceptance using simulation. The resulting distribution is then fit by the sum of shapes \u00f01 \u2212 \u03b1\u00desin 2 \u03b8 and \u03b1\u00f01 \u00fe cos 2 \u03b8\u00de=2, where \u03b1 is the fraction of the helicity AE1 component. For scalar four-pion states the J=\u03c8 helicity is 0, while for higher spin states it is a mixture of helicity 0 and helicity AE1 components. We also show in Fig. 2 the helicity AE1 yields. In the region near 1285 MeV there is a significant helicity AE1 component, as expected if the state we are observing is the f 1 \u00f01285\u00de. There is also a large and wider peak near 1450 MeV in theB 0 s channel. Previously we observed a structure at a mass near 1475 MeV usingB 0 s \u2192 J=\u03c8 \u03c0 \u00fe \u03c0 \u2212 decays that we attributed to f 0 \u00f01370\u00de decay.

While the f 0 \u00f01500\u00de is known to decay into four pions, the structure observed in our data cannot be pure spin 0 because of the significant helicity AE1 component in this mass region. We do not pursue further the composition of the higher mass regions in eitherB 0 s orB 0 decays in this Letter.",

The f 1 \u00f01285\u00de state is modeled by a relativistic Breit-Wigner function multiplied by phase space and convoluted with our mass resolution of 3 MeV. We take the mass and width of the f 1 \u00f01285\u00de as 1282.1 AE 0.6 MeV and 24.2 AE 1.1 MeV, respectively [1]. The combinatorial background is constrained from sideband data and is allowed to vary by its statistical uncertainty. Backgrounds from higher mass resonances are parametrized by Gaussian shapes whose masses and widths are allowed to vary. We restrict the fits to the interval 1.1-1.5 GeV, which contains 94.3% of the signal. The fits to the data are shown in Fig. 3. The results of the fits are listed in Table I along with twice the negative change in the logarithm of the likelihood (\u22122\u0394 ln L) if fit without the signal, and the resulting signal significance. The systematic uncertainties from the signal shape and higher mass resonances have been included. Both final states are seen with significance above five standard deviations. This constitutes the first observation of the  091802-3 f 1 \u00f01285\u00de in b-hadron decays. As a consistency check, we also perform a simultaneous fit to bothB 0 s andB 0 samples letting the mass and width vary in the fit. We find the mass and width of the f 1 \u00f01285\u00de to be 1284.2 AE 2.2 MeV and 32.4 AE 5.8 MeV, respectively, where the uncertainties are statistical only, consistent with the known values. To determine the systematic uncertainty in the yields we redo the fits allowing AE1\u03c3 variations of the mass and width values independently. We assign AE2.7% and AE2.0% for the systematic uncertainties on theB 0 s andB 0 yields, respectively, from this source.",
