            "text": "The T2K (Tokai to Kamioka) experiment is a long-baseline accelerator neutrino oscillation experiment. Intense muon neutrino and antineutrino beams are produced at the J-PARC accelerator complex situated in Tokai. After 280 metres the beam goes through the set of two near detectors: INGRID and ND280, where the beam parameters before oscillations are measured and neutrino cross-sections are studied. After another 295 km, the distance corresponding to the first oscillation maximum, the neutrino beam passes through the Super-Kamiokande far detector. Comparison of the beam characteristics in the near and far detectors makes it possible to determine the oscillation parameters. Based on muon neutrino disappearance, T2K has delivered the world's leading measurement of the \u03b8 23 mixing angle. It has been also the first experiment to observe electron neutrino appearance, with a significance of 7.3\u03c3. These results made it possible to determine the \u03b8 13 mixing angle and to provide the first hint of a non-zero value of the \u03b4 CP phase. The T2K experiment has also delivered several neutrino cross-section measurements at neutrino energies around 1 GeV. Currently, T2K is collecting data with a muon antineutrino beam, for the \u03b4 CP and antineutrino cross-section measurements. A summary of the most recent oscillation measurements, including the new electron antineutrino appearance results, is presented.",

An overview of the T2K experiment is shown in Figure 1. The muon neutrino and the muon antineutrino beams are produced in the Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex (J-PARC) in the Tokai village on the east coast of Japan. After 280 m the beam of unoscillated neutrinos goes through the set of two near detectors: INGRID and ND280. After another 295 km, the distance corresponding to the first oscillation maximum, the beam reaches the far detector Super-Kamiokande (SK). The INGRID near detector is placed on the beam axis, while the ND280 near detector and the SK detector are located 2.5 \u2022 away from the neutrino beam axis. The off-axis beam has a narrower energy spectrum and the peak energy to be selected in order to maximise the oscillation probability. The main goals of the T2K experiment are the measurements of the probability of muon neutrino disappearance, electron neutrino appearance, the investigation of CP symmetry violation/conservation in the neutrino sector and neutrino-nucleus cross-section measurements at T2K beam energies.",

As previously stated, the SK detector cannot distinguish particles from antiparticles and, therefore, the selected events contain both neutrinos and antineutrinos (\u03bd +\u03bd). The preliminary results for muon antineutrino disappearance in the antineutrino beam mode data were shown in [11], the number of predicted \u03bd \u00b5 +\u03bd \u00b5 events without oscillation is 104 (Fig. 5). The measured number of such events is 34. The best fit values for the oscillation parameters for antineutrinos are as follows: sin 2 \u03b8 23 = 0.515 and |\u2206m 2 32 | = 2.33 \u00d7 10 \u22123 eV 2 /c 4 . With this result, T2K has reached the world's best measurement of \u03b8 23 angle in antineutrino mode. The parameter values obtained for neutrinos and antineu- trinos are in agreement within the errors, as predicted by CP T conservation.
