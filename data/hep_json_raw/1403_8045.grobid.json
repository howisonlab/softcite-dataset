The angular distribution is described by two parameters, F H and the forward-backward asymmetry of the dimuon system A FB , which are determined in bins of the dimuon mass squared. The parameter F H is a measure of the contribution from (pseudo)scalar and tensor amplitudes to the decay width. The measurements of A FB and F H reported here are the most precise to date and are compatible with predictions from the Standard Model.",

The B + \u2192 J/\u03c8 K + and B + \u2192 \u03c8(2S)K + decays 2 are rejected by removing the regions of dimuon mass around the charmonium resonances (8.0 < q 2 < 11.0 GeV 2 /c 4 and 12.5 < q 2 < 15.0 GeV 2 /c 4 ). These decays can also form a background to the B + \u2192 K + \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 decay if the kaon is incorrectly identified as a muon and the muon with the same charge is incorrectly identified as a kaon.

The region m(K + \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 ) < 5170 MeV/c 2 is contaminated by partially reconstructed b-hadron decays such as B 0 \u2192 K * 0 \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 where the pion from the K * 0 \u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212 decay is not reconstructed.

The total efficiency for reconstructing the B 0 \u2192 K 0 S \u00b5 + \u00b5 \u2212 decay is about 0.2%, which is a factor of ten lower than for the charged decay. This is due to a combination of three effects: the long flight distance of K 0 S mesons in the detector, the K 0 S \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 branching fraction, and the requirement of having four, rather than three, tracks within the detector acceptance.
