The data were collected in proton-proton collisions at a centreof-mass energy of 13 TeV and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 3.2 fb \u22121 . The observed data are in agreement with the Standard Model expectations. Exclusion limits are presented in models of new phenomena including pair production of dark matter candidates or large extra spatial dimensions. In a simplified model of dark matter and an axial-vector mediator, the search excludes mediator masses below 710 GeV for dark matter candidate masses below 150 GeV. In an effective theory of dark matter production, values of the suppression scale M * up to 570 GeV are excluded and the effect of truncation for various coupling values is reported. For the ADD large extra spatial dimension model the search places more stringent limits than earlier searches in the same event topology, excluding M D up to about 2.3 (2.8) TeV for two (six) additional spatial dimensions; the limits are reduced by 20-40% depending on the number of additional spatial dimensions when applying a truncation procedure.",

However, as the typical momentum transfer in pp collisions at the LHC could reach the cut-off scale required for the EFT approximation to be valid, it is crucial to present the results of the search in terms of models that involve the explicit production of the intermediate state, as shown in figure 1 (left). This paper focuses on simplified models assuming Dirac fermion DM candidates produced via an s-channel mediator with axial-vector interactions [12][13][14]. In this case, the interaction is effectively described by five parameters: the WIMP mass m \u03c7 , the mediator mass m med , the width of the mediator \u0393 med , the coupling of the mediator to quarks g q , and the coupling of the mediator to the dark matter particle g \u03c7 . In the limit of large mediator mass, these simplified models map onto the EFT operators, with the suppression scale 1 M * linked to m med by the relation M * = m med / \u221a g q g \u03c7 [15].",

During the LHC shutdown in 2013-14, an additional inner pixel layer, known as the insertable B-layer [19], was added around a new, smaller radius beam pipe. The ID is surrounded by a thin superconducting solenoid providing a 2 T magnetic field. A high-granularity lead/liquid-argon sampling electromagnetic calorimeter covers the region |\u03b7| < 3.2 and is segmented longitudinally in shower depth. The first layer, with high granularity in the \u03b7 direction, is designed to allow efficient discrimination between single photon showers and two overlapping photons originating from a \u03c0 0 decay. The second layer collects most of the energy deposited in the calorimeter in electromagnetic showers initiated by electrons or photons. Very high energy showers can leave significant energy deposits in the third layer, which can also be used to correct for energy leakage beyond the EM calorimeter. A steel/scintillator-tile calorimeter provides hadronic coverage in the range |\u03b7| < 1.7. The liquid-argon technology is also used for the hadronic calorimeters in the end-cap region 1.5 < |\u03b7| < 3.2 and for electromagnetic and hadronic measurements in the forward region up to |\u03b7| = 4.9. The muon spectrometer (MS) surrounds the calorimeters. It consists of three large air-core superconducting toroidal magnet systems, precision tracking chambers providing accurate muon tracking out to |\u03b7| = 2.7, and fast detectors for triggering in the region |\u03b7| < 2.4. A two-level trigger system is used to select events for offline analysis [20].",

The photon energy is corrected by applying the energy scales measured with Z \u2192 e + e \u2212 decays [47]. The trajectory of the photon is reconstructed using the longitudinal (shower depth) segmentation of the calorimeters and a constraint from the average collision point of the proton beams.

Identification requirements are applied in order to reduce the contamination from \u03c0 0 or other neutral hadrons decaying to two photons.

This SR also provides good sensitivity to the other models described in section 1.

With respect to the Run 1 analysis, a reoptimization was performed that leaded to the following changes: a higher threshold for p \u03b3 T (150 GeV instead of 125 GeV) and a larger |\u03b7| region (|\u03b7| < 2.37 instead of 1.37) are used for the leading photon. It is required that the photon and E miss T do not overlap in the azimuth: \u2206\u03c6(\u03b3, E miss T ) > 0.4. Events with more than one jet or with a jet with \u2206\u03c6(jet, E miss T ) < 0.4 are rejected. The remaining events with one jet are retained to increase the signal acceptance and reduce systematic uncertainties related to the modelling of initial-state radiation. Events are required to have no electrons or muons passing the requirements described in section 4. The lepton veto mainly rejects W/Z events with charged leptons in the final state. For events satisfying these criteria, the efficiency of the trigger used in the analysis is 0.997 +0.003 \u22120.008 , as determined using a control sample of events selected with a E miss T trigger with a threshold of 70 GeV.

            "text": "Background contributions from events in which a jet is misidentified as a photon are estimated using a sideband counting method [61]. This method relies on counting photon candidates in four regions of a two-dimensional space, defined by the transverse isolation energy and by the quality of the identification criteria. A signal region (region A) is defined by photon candidates that are isolated with tight identification. Three background regions are defined, consisting of photon candidates which are either tight and non-isolated (region B), non-tight and isolated (region C) or non-tight and non-isolated (region D). The method relies on the fact that signal contamination in the three background regions is small and that the isolation profile in the non-tight region is the same as that of the background in the tight region. The number of background candidates in the signal region (N A ) is calculated by taking the ratio of the two non-tight regions (N C /N D ) multiplied by the number of candidates in the tight, non-isolated region (N B ). This method is applied in all analysis regions: the SR and the four CRs. The systematic uncertainty of the method is evaluated by varying the criteria of tightness and isolation used to define the four regions. This estimate also accounts for the contribution from multi-jet events, which can mimic the \u03b3 + E miss T signature if one jet is misreconstructed as a photon and one or more of the other jets are poorly reconstructed, resulting in large E miss T . The estimated contribution of this background in the SR and the associated error are reported in section 7.",

PDF uncertainties have an impact on the V \u03b3 samples in each region but the effect on normalization is largely absorbed in the fit. They are evaluated following the prescriptions of the PDF group recommendations [63] and using a reweighting procedure implemented in the LHAPDF Tool [64].

The uncertainty on the jet fake rate contributes a relative uncertainty of 2.4% and affects mainly the normalization of W (\u2192 \u03bd)\u03b3 background, while the uncertainty on the muon reconstruction and isolation efficiency gives a relative uncertainty of 1.5% and mainly affects the Z(\u2192 )\u03b3 background.

Results incorporating truncation in the phase-space region where the model implementation is not valid are also shown. This consists in suppressing the graviton production cross section by a factor M 4 D /s 2 in events with centre-of-mass energy \u221a s > M D . The procedure is repeated iteratively with the new truncated limit until it converges, i.e., until the difference between the new truncated limit and the one obtained in the previous iteration differ by less than 0.1\u03c3. It results in a decrease of the 95% CL limit on M D . The search sets limits that are more stringent than those from LHC Run 1, excluding M D up to about 2.3 TeV for n = 2 and up to 2.8 TeV for n = 6; the limit values are reduced by 20 to 40% depending on n when applying a truncation procedure.",

The observed data are consistent with the Standard Model expectations. The observed (expected) upper limits on the fiducial cross section for the production of events with a photon and large missing transverse momentum are 17.8 (25.5) fb at 95% CL and 14.6 (21.7) fb at 90% CL. For the simplified DM model considered, the search excludes mediator masses below 710 GeV for \u03c7 masses below 150 GeV. For the EW-EFT model values of M * up to 570 GeV are excluded and the effect of truncation for various coupling values is reported. For the ADD model the search sets limits that are more stringent than in the Run 1 data search, excluding M D up to about 2.3 TeV for n = 2 and up to 2.8 TeV for n = 6; the limit values are reduced by 20-40% depending on n when applying a truncation procedure.
