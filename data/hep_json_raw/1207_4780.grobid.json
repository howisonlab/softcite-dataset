Such methods have been shown to work well in environments with low occupancy of particles per unit of calorimeter granularity. However, at higher instantaneous luminosity or in detectors with coarse calorimeter segmentation, the overlaps of calorimeter energy deposits from charged and neutral particles significantly complicate particle energy reconstruction, reducing the overall energy resolution of the method. We present a technique designed to resolve overlapping energy depositions of spatially close particles using a statistically consistent probabilistic procedure. The technique is nearly free of ad-hoc corrections, improves energy resolution, and provides new important handles that can improve the sensitivity of physics analyses: the uncertainty of the jet energy on an event-by-event basis and the estimate of the probability of a given particle hypothesis for a given detector response. When applied to the reconstruction of hadronic jets produced in the decays of tau leptons using the CDF-II detector at Fermilab, the method has demonstrated reliable and robust performance.",

For example,the momenta of charged hadrons can be measured much more accurately using the tracking system (except for the case of very high transverse momenta, which is not relevant for this discussion), than in the calorimeter.

In this case one has to \"guess\" the fraction of the measured calorimeter energy deposited by the charged pion, so that the excess can be attributed to a neutral hadron.

Neutral hadrons produced in hadronic tau lepton decays are dominated by neutral pions 5 , which promptly decay to photons via \u03c0 0 \u2192\u03b3\u03b3. Tau leptons accessible at hadron machines typically originate from Z or W decays and therefore have 4 the number of charged hadrons in tau lepton decays is always odd owing to the conservation of electric charge 5 Only about 2% of the time tau decay products contain one or more neutral kaon a substantial momentum. This leads to their decay products being fairly collimated and appearing as jets of charged and neutral hadrons, reminiscent of regular jets originating from quarks or gluons. The decay products of tau leptons undergoing hadronic decays are therefore frequently referred to as \"tau jets\". The PF-based reconstruction allowed for a strong improvement in the energy resolution of hadronic tau jets, and the technique was further improved and used at CDF for Run II analyses [5]. A more comprehensive implementation of the same technique [6] has been shown to improve the generic jet resolution at CDF compared to a calorimeter only reconstruction. However, the coarse segmentation of the CDF calorimeter has led to a sizable confusion term associated with the substantial probability for more than one particle to deposit energy in a given calorimeter cluster. The difficulty in resolving such overlaps of energy depositions required to reconstruct momenta of individual particles allowed for only a limited improvement. A complete PFA algorithm developed by the CMS experiment [7] has allowed for a strong improvement in the jet energy measurement as well as a more accurate missing transverse energy scale and resolution. The CMS detector is well suited for PFA-based reconstruction due to the fine granularity of the electromagnetic calorimeter and the longitudinal profiling of hadronic showers in the central part of the detector, which improves their spatial resolution. However, the series of the \"High Luminosity LHC\" upgrades are expected to result in significant increases in particle occupancies per event. Maintaining high performance of the PFA-based reconstruction in the new regime requires the development of techniques capable of efficiently resolving energy overlaps.",

The likelihood L p is essentially a sum of probabilities of all possible outcomes, i.e. the specific values of energy deposited by each particle in the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeter clusters, consistent with the actual cluster energy measurements (the latter is ensured by the delta functions). The probability of each outcome is a product of probabilities P ij for each particle to deposit given amounts of energy E j1 i , E j2 i in the hadronic and electromagnetic calorimeters, given their assumed true momenta p i . In many practical cases, the strongest effect that M in Eq.(6) has to properly account for is the correlation of the values of the deposits by the same particle in the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters, e.g. early showering of a charged hadron can lead to a larger than typical deposition of energy in the electromagnetic calorimeter, but the energy deposited in the hadron calorimeter would consequently be lower than typical. The easiest way to take this kind of correlation into account is to switch to two-dimensional response functions While the most probable set of particle momenta p is obtained by maximizing the likelihood L p ( p | E meas ), the likelihood shape in the p space can be used to evaluate the uncertainty in the energy determination for each particle.

In the CEM, hadronic showers rarely deposit energy in more than a single tower, therefore the charged pion electromagnetic deposition is calculated using the energy in the tower pointed at by the track associated with \u03c0 \u00b1 . To take into account the strong correlation of the energy depositions by the same particle in CEM and CHA, we define a 2-dimensional response function in the E EM versus E HAD plane.

The adequacy of the CDF simulation of the calorimeter response can be inferred from the results of a dedicated study [12], in which simulation predictions were compared with the pion test beam data and with the collisions data using a pure sample of isolated charged pions.

Fortunately, the calorimeter response to photons and electrons is nearly identical, allowing for the use of a relatively high purity sample of electrons in data obtained by tagging photon conversions.

However, disentangling the contributions to energy resolution from the confusion in assigning energy is not straightforward in PPFA due to the complex convolution of multiple detector responses, including not only the calorimeters but also the Shower Maximum detector. A qualitative feel for the level of the improvement can be deduced from the distributions shown in Fig. 7. As tau decay products rarely contain K 0 L 's, the shape of the underlying broad distribution beneath the the near-gaussian narrow core has a substantial contribution from the \"confusion\" cases where the electromagnetic deposition of charged pions was not correctly estimated, leading to relatively large mismeasurements. It also has other non-negligible contributions, for example large non-uniformity effects in the response of the electromagnetic calorimeter near the edges of the towers can lead to substantial mismeasurements in tau jet energy if an energetic photon enters the calorimeter near the edge of the tower. These additional effects do not allow one to unambiguously associate the entire shape of the broad component of these distributions with the confusion term. However, narrowing of this distribution in the PPFA case compared to the standard CDF PF-based tau jet reconstruction is most certainly due to improved treatment of the \"confusion prone\" cases, e.g. see Fig. 7(c) where the fraction of these potentially difficult events is enhanced by the requirement of a track and a CES cluster in the same tower. Therefore the observed improvement can arguably be taken as a lower bound on the relative improvement in the confusion term in PPFA as compared to the standard CDF technique.",

Unlike the case of Z\u2192ee or Z\u2192\u00b5\u00b5 events where lepton momentum resolution can be inferred from the broadness of the dilepton mass spectrum, there is no such \"standard candle\" for taus at hadron colliders. In the case of Z\u2192\u03c4 \u03c4 , which is the only fairly clean physics signal enriched with true taus accessible at hadron colliders, the shape of the invariant mass distribution calculated using visible tau decay products is very broad, as partial cancellation of the missing transverse energy E / T associated with momenta of the neutrinos from tau decays precludes reconstructing neutrino momenta. In addition to the improved energy resolution, the PPFA can potentially deliver other advantages, e.g. a better discrimination against QCD multi-jet backgrounds due to \"sharper\" shapes of identification variables and the new PPFA specific handles, such as the estimate of the jet energy uncertainty on a jet-by-jet basis and the p-value. However, as many of these potential improvements are correlated, disentangling and quantifying each of these potential improvements separately is not practical.

The framework is based on \"first principles\" and is essentially free of ad-hoc corrections. The PPFA can be implemented in a realistic detector setting, as demonstrated using the example of hadronic tau reconstruction at CDF. It is shown to provide a more accurate jet energy measurement and better discrimination against backgrounds compared to the existing tools utilizing the particle flow concept. For hadronic tau reconstruction, the new tools provided by the PPFA, such as a jet-by-jet estimate of the jet energy uncertainty and the p-value quantifying the likelihood of the current hypothesis about particle content of a jet, can be used to further improve energy resolution and provide better discrimination against backgrounds. The proposed technique can be utilized at the LHC experiments once the machine is upgraded for the very high luminosity regime as well as at future collider experiments.",

While the energy of electromagnetic showers can be measured very well, large fluctuations in the development of hadronic showers lead to a significantly lower precision 2 . The non-equal response of the non-compensating calorimeters to electromagnetic and hadronic showers 3 further biases the overall jet energy scale and degrades the resolution. Special corrections accounting for non-equal response can only partially recover this reduction in resolution. While the presence of many particles in a jet averages out fluctuations in the measurement of energy of individual hadronic showers, jet energy resolution remains poor for jets of low (\u223c10-30 GeV) and moderate (\u223c30-60 GeV) energies. Incidentally, the resolution of low-to-moderate energy jets has a strong impact on the sensitivity of many physics analyses performed at hadron colliders, from precision measurements of the Standard Model parameters to searches for the Higgs boson in bb and \u03c4 \u03c4 channels and searches for new phenomena such as predicted by Supersymmetry.
