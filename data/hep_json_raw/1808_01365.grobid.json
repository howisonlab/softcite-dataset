            "text": "Heavy resonances that decay to HH, VV, or VH, where H denotes the Higgs boson, and V denotes a W or Z boson, are motivated by theories beyond the standard model (SM) that address the large difference between the electroweak and gravitational scales. These heavy particles arise as Kaluza-Klein (KK) excitations of spin-0 radions [1][2][3], and as spin-2 gravitons predicted in models based on Randall-Sundrum warped extra dimensions [4,5], with the gravitons propagating in the entire five-dimensional bulk [6][7][8]. Heavy spin-1 W and Z particles that decay to VV and VH are also postulated in composite Higgs models [9][10][11][12], little Higgs models [13,14], and in the sequential SM (SSM) [15]. The models containing new spin-1 states are generalized in the heavy vector triplet (HVT) framework [16]. All of the new hypothetical particles with spins of 0, 1, or 2 can be produced at the CERN LHC, via the processes depicted in the Feynman diagrams of figure 1. The bulk graviton model has two free parameters: the mass of the first KK excitation of the spin-2 boson, denoted as the KK bulk graviton, and the ratiok \u2261 k/M Pl , where k is the unknown curvature scale of the extra dimension and M Pl \u2261 M Pl / \u221a 8\u03c0 is the reduced Planck mass. Searches for radions in this model can be described in terms of the radion mass and the ultraviolet cutoff of the theory \u039b R [17]. The HVT model is formulated in terms of four parameters: the mass of the new vector bosons, their coupling coefficient to fermions c F , their coupling coefficient to the Higgs boson and longitudinally-polarized SM JHEP01(2019)051 Figure 1. Feynman diagrams for the production of a spin-0 radion or a spin-2 graviton X that decays to two Higgs bosons (left), and the production of a heavy vector boson V (W or Z ) that decays to a vector boson and a Higgs boson (right).",

In the HVT framework two scenarios are considered and henceforth referred to as model A and model B, depending on the couplings of the new physics resonance to the SM particles. In model A (g V = 1, c H = \u22120.556, c F = \u22121.316), the coupling strengths to the SM bosons and fermions are comparable and the new particles decay primarily to fermions. In model B (g V = 3, c H = \u22120.976, c F = 1.024), the coupling to the SM fermions are small, and the branching fraction of the new resonance to SM bosons is nearly 100% [16]. Searches for diboson resonances have previously been performed in several final states, placing lower limits on the masses of such resonances above the TeV scale [18][19][20][21][22][23][24][25][26][27][28][29][30][31][32][33].",

Events are classified as \"semileptonic\", denoted as \u03c4 h , if one \u03c4 lepton decays into a lighter lepton ( ), denoting either a muon or an electron, and two neutrinos, and the other decays hadronically (\u03c4 h ) into hadrons and a neutrino. Events are categorized as \"fully-hadronic\", denoted as \u03c4 h \u03c4 h , if both \u03c4 leptons decay hadronically. The analysis aims to reconstruct the diboson decay products in order to search for a narrow local enhancement in the diboson invariant mass spectrum with a width insignificant with respect to the experimental resolution. This search complements and significantly extends the reach of the CMS search for ZH \u2192 qq\u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 resonances with data collected at \u221a s = 8 TeV [34], by using a larger data sample collected at \u221a s = 13 TeV, a more complex categorization of the final states, and an increased number of signal models. Resonances of masses below the TeV scale have been excluded by other searches in similar final states [35,36].",

Two distance parameters are used in the analysis, 0.4 and 0.8, yielding jet collections referred to as AK4 and AK8 jets, respectively. The AK4 jets are used primarily to reject or select events with top quarks, while the larger AK8 jets are used to identify and contain hadronically decaying W, Z, and Higgs boson candidates. The charged-hadron subtraction (CHS) algorithm for mitigating pileup [47] discards charged particles not originating from the primary vertex (PV). The PV is defined as the vertex with the largest p 2 T sum of the physics objects. Here, the physics objects are the AK4 jets, and the associated missing transverse momentum, which is taken as the negative vector sum of the p T of the jets. The residual contamination from neutral pileup particles is estimated to be proportional to the event energy density and the jet area, and is removed from the jet energy calculation. The jet momentum is determined as the vectorial sum of all particle momenta in the jet, and is found from simulation to be within 5 to 10% of the true momentum over the entire p T spectrum and detector acceptance. Jet energy corrections are obtained from simulation, and are confirmed with in situ measurements of the energy balance in dijet, multijet, \u03b3+jets, and leptonically decaying Z+jets events [50]. Additional selection criteria are applied to each event to remove spurious jet-like features originating from isolated noise patterns in certain HCAL regions [51]. The AK4 and AK8 jets must have p T > 20 and p T > 200 GeV, respectively, and |\u03b7| < 2.4 to be considered in the subsequent steps of the analysis.",

            "text": "A dedicated algorithm is used to reconstruct Higgs bosons decaying to one or two \u03c4 h candidates [58]. The procedure begins by using the Cambridge-Aachen algorithm [59] with a distance parameter of 0.8 to identify jets with a large cone size, called CA8 jets. For each CA8 jet with p T > 100 GeV, the last step of the clustering is retracted, obtaining two subjets. If these subjets are found to have p T > 10 GeV and satisfy the mass dropcondition, which requires max(m subjet1 , m subjet2 )/m CA8jet < 2/3, the two subjets are used as seeds in the standard \u03c4 lepton reconstruction and the \"hadron-plus-strips\" algorithm [60] is applied to them to identify \u03c4 h candidates. If the p T and mass drop conditions are not met, the unclustering and identification procedures are repeated (iteratively) for the most energetic subjet. The \u03c4 h candidates selected through the hadron-plus-strips algorithm are then required to have |\u03b7| < 2.3 and p T > 20 GeV, and to satisfy a multivariate-discriminator threshold, obtained using a boosted decision tree technique [61]. This algorithm is trained to discriminate between genuine \u03c4 h and generic jets, using variables related to energy deposits and track impact parameters that are correlated with the \u03c4 lepton lifetime. If no \u03c4 h candidates are identified with this method, then the procedure is repeated using AK4 jets as seeds, with similar selection requirements. The \u03c4 h candidate of highest p T is JHEP01 (2019)051required to satisfy an isolation requirement that corresponds to a 50-60% efficiency in the considered topology. If two \u03c4 h candidates are identified, as in the \u03c4 h \u03c4 h channel, the isolation requirement on the \u03c4 h of second highest p T is relaxed to achieve a 70-80% efficiency. The probability to misidentify a CA8 jet as an H \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 decay is below 0.1%, after these selection criteria.",

The background-only hypothesis is tested against the signal hypothesis simultaneously in the different categories. No evidence of significant deviations from the background expectation is found. Assuming that the signals have widths that are negligible relative to the resonance-mass resolution of approximately 7%, the 95% confidence level (CL) upper limits are determined for the signals using the asymptotic frequentist method [70,72,73]. Limits are obtained on the product of the cross section and branching fraction for a heavy resonance (X) that decays to HH, WH, or ZH, as reported in figures 5-6. Resonance spins of 0 and 2 are considered for the HH final state, while the resonance spin is assumed to be 1 for the WH and ZH final states. For the WH and ZH final states, the W and Z boson mass regions are combined because there are contributions from both signals to the two mass regions. Because of its higher signal selection efficiency, typical sensitivities are better for the \u03c4 h channel than for the \u03c4 h \u03c4 h channel, by a factor that varies between 5 and 2 for resonance masses between 0.9 and 4.0 TeV. For spin-1 resonances, the HP category has a factor of 4 and 2 better sensitivity than the LP category, for low and high resonance masses, respectively. For resonances of spin 0 and 2, the 1 b-tagged subjet category has a sensitivity lower by a factor 6 for low resonance masses, compared to the category with 2 b-tagged subjets, but their sensitivities are equal for resonance masses of 4 TeV. The exclusion limit ranges from 80 to 5 fb for resonances of spin 0 and 2, and from 180 to 5 fb for spin-1 resonances.",
