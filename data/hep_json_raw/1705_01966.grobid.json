Final states with a photon and a Z boson decaying into a pair of either electrons, muons, or neutrinos are analysed. Electroweak and total pp \u2192 Z\u03b3jj cross-sections are extracted in two fiducial regions with different sensitivities to electroweak production processes. Quartic couplings of vector bosons are studied in regions of phase space with an enhanced contribution from pure electroweak production, sensitive to vector-boson scattering processes V V \u2192 Z\u03b3. No deviations from Standard Model predictions are observed and constraints are placed on anomalous couplings parameterized by higher-dimensional operators using effective field theory.",

At the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), it can be deduced from studies of processes with either three bosons in the final state [6][7][8][9][10] or involving pure electroweak production of heavy dibosons [11][12][13][14]. In particular, the CMS experiment recently studied Z\u03b3 and used these results to set limits on anomalous QGCs. Final states involving photons have higher rates than those involving only W and Z bosons identified via their leptonic decay modes. The Z\u03b3jj electroweak (EWK) production (qq \u2192 qqZ\u03b3) -where j represents a jet and q a quark -contains processes with fourth-order electroweak coupling O(\u03b1 4 em ). These include vector-boson scattering (VBS) as well as non-VBS diagrams, e.g. when the Z boson and the photon are radiated off the initial-or final-state quarks (figure 1, left). The VBS processes do not respect the electroweak gauge symmetry when taken in isolation and cannot be studied separately from other electroweak processes, due to large interference effects.",

This background is not well modelled by the MC simulation. It is estimated with data using the same twodimensional sideband method [43] used in the inclusive Z\u03b3 cross-section measurement [9]. The method is based on control regions populated by events satisfying all selection criteria but with the candidate photon failing to satisfy some of the identification criteria and/or the isolation requirement. Due to the very limited number of events in the search and control regions, the background contribution from Z+jets events is estimated in an enlarged phase-space region, relaxing the dijet mass requirement to m jj > 100 GeV. This is the most stringent requirement on m jj where the uncertainty on the background estimated is still dominated by systematic errors. The extrapolation of the background estimate to the search and control regions relies on the observation that the shape of the m jj distribution of Z+jets background events (i.e. with one jet faking a photon) in both the Powheg and Alpgen MC samples is similar to the m jj distribution of Z\u03b3 events in Sherpa MC samples, for m jj > 100 GeV.

Figure 2 displays the transverse energy of the photon after various selection requirements (inclusive selection, control and search regions); figure 3 shows the numbers of selected jets in the control and search regions; figure 4 shows the distribution of the dijet mass for the inclusive selection; and finally figure 5 displays the distributions of \u03b6 Z\u03b3 in the inclusive, control and search regions.

Given the very limited number of signal events expected after the \u03bd\u03bd\u03b3jj selection, that topology is only used in the search for anomalous quartic couplings described in section 7. Fiducial regions are defined at the particle level, using stable particles -those with proper lifetime longer than 10 ps -before their interaction with the detector. Prompt lepton four-momenta -not from hadron or \u03c4 decays -are obtained through a fourvector sum of leptons with radiated photons within a cone of radius \u2206R = 0.1 around the leptons (\"dressed leptons\"). Jets are reconstructed with the anti-k t jet reconstruction algorithm with radius parameter R = 0.4 using stable particles, excluding muons and neutrinos. The photon isolation energy is taken as the energy of the jet matching the photon (\u2206R(j, \u03b3) < 0.3), with the photon energy subtracted. These fiducial phase-space regions where the measurements are performed are defined to be as close as possible to the experimental phase-space regions, corresponding to the reconstructed-event selection described in section 4. This minimizes the extrapolation to the particle-level phase space by the MC simulation. Table 5 summarizes the selection that are applied to obtain the various fiducial regions. The fraction of events in the SR fiducial region passing the reconstructed event selection is about 94% for the charged-lepton channel.",

The neutrino channel provides the best expected intervals for all operators. However, they are improved by 10-30% when the results from both channels are combined. The channel combination is obtained taking into account correlations between systematic uncertainties. In particular, the systematic uncertainties of the photon identification efficiency, uncertainties due to the jet energy scale and resolution, PDF uncertainties, uncertainties in parton-shower modelling, and the systematic uncertainty on the QCD renormalisation and factorization scales are considered as correlated. Among these systematic uncertainties, the QCD renormalization and factorization scale uncertainties are the leading ones, and are 8.0% (7.7%) in the charged-lepton (neutrino) channel. Table 9 shows the expected and observed 95% CL intervals derived with the \u039b FF set to the maximum allowed value to preserve unitarity, according to the Vbfnlo calculation. The expected and observed 95% CL intervals derived without respecting the unitarity bounds (n = 0) and without other unitarization restrictions are also reported in  Table 9. Measured and expected one-dimensional 95% confidence level intervals on aQGC parameters (in the Vbfnlo formalism) using the combination of all Z\u03b3jj channels (charged-lepton and neutrino).

The maximum allowed form-factor values \u039b FF are chosen, according to the unitarity bounds calculated by Vbfnlo and are also reported in this table.
