            "text": "The scientific motivation of neutrino telescopes relies on the unique properties of neutrinos, which can be used to observe and study the high-energy universe. Cosmic rays or highenergy photons have intrinsic limitations: the mean free path of gamma-ray photons strongly depends on their energy, while magnetic fields deflect cosmic rays, diluting the information about their origin. Neutrinos are stable, neutral, and weakly interacting particles, and therefore they point directly back to their origin. In addition, neutrinos are expected to originate at the same locations where the acceleration of cosmic rays and the associated production of high-energy photons take place (Halzen & Hooper 2002;Stecker 2005;Bednarek et al. 2005). The first evidence of such a cosmic neutrino signal has recently been reported by IceCube (Aartsen et al. 2013a(Aartsen et al. , 2013c, including in particular a cluster of events close to the Galactic Center. While this cluster is not statistically significant, Gonz\u00e1lez-Garc\u00eda et al. (2013) have proposed they may be due to a single point source. The better view of the Southern Hemisphere afforded by the ANTARES neutrino telescope, due to its location in the Mediterranean Sea, provides an increased sensitivity to galactic sources of neutrinos with energies <100 TeV. This is particularly important in order to interpret the cluster of events observed by IceCube close to the Galactic Center.",

It is made of 12 slender lines spaced by about 65 m, anchored on the seabed at 2475 m depth and maintained vertical by a buoy. Each line of 350 m active length comprises 25 floors spaced regularly, each housing three photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) looking downward at an angle of 45 \u2022 . The detection principle is based on the observation of the Cherenkov light induced by muons produced in charged current interactions of high energy neutrinos inside or near the detector volume. Some of the emitted photons produce a signal in the PMTs (\"hits\") with the corresponding charge and time information. The hits are used to reconstruct the direction of the muon. In addition, other neutrino signatures such as cascade events are also detected and reconstructed. The current analysis uses muon tracks only, which offer a better angular resolution and larger volume than cascades caused by showering events.",

The full-sky search looks for an excess of signal events located anywhere in the whole ANTARES visible sky. A preclustering algorithm to select candidate clusters of at least 4 events in a cone of half-opening angle of 3 \u2022 is performed. For each cluster, L s+b is maximized by varying the free parameters x s and n s . In this analysis, the most significant cluster is found at (\u03b1, \u03b4) = (\u221246. \u2022 8, \u221264. \u2022 9) with a post-trial p-value of 2.7% (significance of 2.2\u03c3 using the two-sided convention). This direction is consistent with the most significant cluster found in the previous analysis. The number of fitted signal events is n s = 6.2. A total of 6 (14) events in a cone of 1 \u2022 (3 \u2022 ) around the fitted cluster center are found. Upper limits at the 90% confidence level (CL) on the muon neutrino flux from point sources located anywhere in the visible ANTARES sky are given by the light blue-dashed line in Figure 3. Each value corresponds to the highest upper-limit obtained in declination bands of 1 \u2022 .",

            "text": "Following the recent evidence of high energy neutrinos by IceCube (Aartsen et al. 2013a), a point source close to the Galactic Center has been proposed to explain the accumulation of seven events in its neighborhood (Gonz\u00e1lez-Garc\u00eda et al. 2013). The corresponding flux normalization of this hypothetical source (\u03b1 = \u221279 \u2022 , \u03b4 = \u221223 \u2022 ) is expected to be \u03a6 0 = 6 \u00d7 10 \u22128 GeV cm \u22122 s \u22121 . This hypothetical source might be located at a different point in the sky due to the large uncertainty of the direction estimates of these IceCube events. The full-sky algorithm with the likelihood presented in Adri\u00e1n-Mart\u00ednez et al. (2012) is used, restricted to region of 20 \u2022 around the proposed location. The trial factor of this analysis is smaller than in the full-sky search because of the smaller size of the region. In addition to the point source hypothesis, three Gaussian-like source extensions are assumed (0. \u2022 5, 1 \u2022 and 3 \u2022 ). As in the full-sky search, a half opening angle of 3 \u2022 is used for the pre-clustering selection for source widths smaller than 3 \u2022 . In the case of the 3 \u2022 source assumption, the angle is of 6 \u2022 . No significant cluster has been found. Figure 4 shows the 90% CL flux upper limits obtained for the four assumed different spatial extensions of the neutrino source as a function of the declination. The presence of a point source with a flux normalization of 6\u00d710 \u22128 GeV cm \u22122 s \u22121 anywhere in the region is excluded. Therefore, the excess found by IceCube in this region cannot be caused by a single point source. Furthermore, a source width of 0. \u2022 5 for declinations lower than \u221211 \u2022 is also excluded. For an E \u22122 spectrum, neutrinos with E > 2 PeV contribute only 7% to the event rate, hence these results are hardly affected by a cutoff at energies on the order of PeV.",

In the first case, the most significant cluster has a post-trial p-value of 2.7% (a significance of 2.2\u03c3 ). In the case of the candidate list study, the largest excess corresponds to HESS J0632+057 with a posttrial p-value of 6.1% (1.9\u03c3 ). Both results are compatible with a pure background hypothesis. The derived flux upper limits are the most restrictive in a significant part of the Southern sky. The possibility that the accumulation of seven events reported by IceCube near the Galactic Center is produced by a single point source has been excluded. These results show the potential of neutrino telescopes in the Northern hemisphere, such as the planned KM3NeT observatory (Leisos et al. 2013), to interpret the increasing evidence of cosmic neutrino fluxes.",
