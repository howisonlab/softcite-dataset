            "text": "Astrophysical data reveal in a more and more convincing way that our knowledge of the Universe is limited to about 4-5% of the total matter-energy content: this is generally interpreted as an evidence of the existence of dark matter and dark energy components. In recent years, several astrophysical observations have failed to find a common interpretation in terms of standard astrophysical or particle physics sources [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11]. Although there are alternative explanations for some of these results, they could all be explained with the existence of a dark matter weakly interacting massive particle, WIMP, belonging to a secluded gauge sector under which the Standard Model (SM) particles are uncharged [12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20][21]. In a minimal model, a new abelian U (1) S gauge field is introduced, the U boson or dark photon, with mass near the GeV scale, coupled to the SM only through its kinetic mixing with the SM hypercharge field. The kinetic mixing parameter is expected to be of the order 10 \u22124 -10 \u22122 [13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20][21][22], so that observable effects can be detected at e + e \u2212 colliders [22][23][24][25][26] or at fixed target experiments working in the GeV region [27][28][29][30]. The existence of the U boson, through its mixing with the ordinary photon, can also accommodate the observed discrepancy in the measured muon anomalous magnetic moment a \u03bc with respect to the SM prediction [31]. Several searches of the U boson have been performed in recent years with negative results, setting upper limits to : A1 [32,33], APEX [34], WASA [35], HADES [36], KLOE [37,38], BaBar [39].",

In this work the Higgsstrahlung process e + e \u2212 \u2192 Uh is studied, using data collected by the KLOE experiment at the e + e \u2212 collider DA NE at the Frascati laboratory, both at a center of mass energy of \u223c1019 MeV, the mass of the \u03c6 meson (on-peak sample), and at a center of mass energy of \u223c1000 MeV (off-peak sample). The process e + e \u2212 \u2192 Uh , with U decaying into lepton or hadron pairs, is an interesting reaction to be studied at an e + e \u2212 collider, being less suppressed, in terms of the mixing parameter, than the other final states listed above. There are two very different scenarios depending on the masses of the dark photon m U and of the dark Higgs boson m h . For m h larger than 2m U , the dark Higgs boson would decay dominantly and promptly to a U boson pair, thus giving rise to a six charged particle final state (the scenario with m h larger than m U but smaller than 2m U is similar, with one dark photon off shell): this case was recently investigated by the BaBar [40] and Belle [41] experiments. On the other side, Higgs bosons lighter than the dark photon would have, in most of the parameter space region, such a large lifetime to escape detection, showing up as a missing energy signature. We confined the search only to the latter case, m h < m U , the so-called \"invisible\" dark Higgs scenario.",

In the on-peak and off-peak samples the most significant values exceeding the 3\u03c3 threshold are at the level of 3.9\u03c3 and 3.8\u03c3 respectively (see Fig. 4, left plot). These excesses, even though at quite interesting level, are then lost in the combination of the two samples, becoming fluctuations of average size. In order to cope with cases in which a possible signal is located just at the intersection of two or more adjacent bins (thus likely losing the feature of showing up as a single bin excess over the background) the full procedure was repeated based on distributions which are half bin shifted (both in M \u03bc\u03bc and M miss directions) with respect to the ones in Fig. 2. No relevant difference was found.",

They are shown in Fig. 5. Fig. 6 shows the on-peak and off-peak 90% CL upper limits projected along the m U and m h axes after a slight smoothing to make them more readable. The different curves in m U (m h ) correspond to different values of m h (m U ). These results were then combined by taking into account the different integrated luminosities of the two samples and the respective signal efficiencies and cross sections. The combined results are almost everywhere dominated by the on-peak sample, because of the larger available statistics, with the exception of some very noisy background regions. They are shown in Fig. 7. These limits are largely dominated by the data statistics. Values as low as 10 \u22129 \u00f7 10 \u22128 of the product \u03b1 D \u00d7 2 are excluded at 90% CL for a large range of the dark photon and dark Higgs masses.",

Signal samples have been generated for various pairs of m h -m U values along a grid with steps of \u223c30 MeV to cover all the allowed kinematic region. The invariant mass resolution varies between 0.5 and 2 MeV for the muon pair (M \u03bc\u03bc ), and between 3 and 17 MeV for the event missing mass (M miss ). The signal process signature would thus be the appearance of a sharp peak in the bidimensional distribution M \u03bc\u03bc -M miss . Moreover, the distribution of the polar angle direction of the muon pair momentum, \u03b8 , contrarily to most of the dominant background processes, is expected to prefer large angles. The differential cross section has two dominant terms proportional to sin \u03b8 and sin 3 \u03b8 [23], withrelative weights smoothly dependent on the boson masses. This angular distribution allows to reject most of the background of QED processes with a simple geometrical selection and implies that the missing momentum direction preferably points to a very well equipped region of the KLOE detector, where the best efficiency is achieved.Fig. 1shows the distributions of the muon pair polar angle direction for the signal e + e \u2212 \u2192 Uh (black line) and the e + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 \u03b3 background (red line), where all the generated samples at various m U and m h masses are included in the signal sample.As a first step of the analysis, a preselection was performed by requiring:",
