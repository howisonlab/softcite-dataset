This corresponds to a branching fraction B(\u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03b3e + e \u2212 ) = (4.69 \u00b1 0.20(stat.) \u00b1 0.23(sys.)) \u00d7 10 \u22124 . The transition form factor is extracted and different expressions are compared to the measured dependence on the e + e \u2212 invariant mass. The results are consistent with the prediction of the Vector Meson Dominance model.",

If one assumes point-like particles, the decay rates can be exactly calculated by Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) [2]. Modifications to the QED decay rate due to the inner structure of the mesons are encoded in the transition form factor (TFF) F (q 2 ), where q is the momentum transferred to the lepton pair, and q 2 is the square of the invariant mass of the lepton pair. A recent summary and discussion of this subject can be found in Ref. [3].",

The theoretical uncertainty on the SM calculation of a \u00b5 is dominated by hadronic corrections and therefore limited by the accuracy of their determination. In particular, the hadronic light-by-light (HLbL) scattering contribution to a \u00b5 includes two meson-photonphoton vertices that can be related to the form factors in P \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 * \u2192 \u03b3e + e \u2212 decays [5].

            "text": "In summary, with a sample of 1.31 billion J/\u03c8 events collected in the BESIII detector, we have made the first measurement of the EM Dalitz decay process \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03b3e + e \u2212 and measure the ratio \u0393(\u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03b3e + e \u2212 )/\u0393(\u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3) = (2.13 \u00b1 0.09(stat.) \u00b1 0.07(sys.)) \u00d7 10 \u22122 . Using the PDG value for the \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 branching fraction [22], we determine B(\u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03b3e + e \u2212 ) = (4.69 \u00b1 0.20(stat.) \u00b1 0.23(sys.)) \u00d7 10 \u22124 . We present measurements of the TFF as a function of M (e + e \u2212 ). Our TFF results can be described with a single pole parameterization Eq. (4), with mass and width parame-ters of \u039b \u03b7 \u2032 = (0.79 \u00b1 0.04(stat.) \u00b1 0.02(sys.)) GeV, and \u03b3 \u03b7 \u2032 = (0.13 \u00b1 0.06(stat.) \u00b1 0.03(sys.)) GeV, respectively. The slope of the TFF corresponds to (1.60 \u00b1 0.17(stat.)\u00b1 0.08(sys.)) GeV \u22122 and agrees within errors with the VMD model predictions. The uncertainty of the \u03b7 \u2032 transition form factor slope matches the best determination in the space-like region from the CELLO collaboration b \u03b7 \u2032 = (1.60 \u00b1 0.16) GeV \u22122 [30], and improves the previous determination of the slope in the time-like region b \u03b7 \u2032 = (1.7 \u00b1 0.4) GeV \u22122 [1,8]. The \u03b7 \u2032 form factor is determined by both universal \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 rescattering and a reaction specific part, with the latter contributing about 20% to the form factor slope [14]. Therefore our result is sensitive specifically to the \u03b7 \u2032 internal EM structure. In addition, the decay \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03b3e + e \u2212 is closely related to \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03b3\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , and in particular the transition form factor could be predicted from the invariant mass distribution of the two pions and the branching ratio of the \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03b3\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decay in a model independent way using a dispersive integral. Also, the knowledge of the TFF is useful for studies of the HLbL scattering contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment, a \u00b5 = (g \u00b5 \u2212 2)/2 [5].",
