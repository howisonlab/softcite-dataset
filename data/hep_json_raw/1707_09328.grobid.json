The data were recorded with the BABAR detector at center-of-mass energies at and near the \u03a5 (4S) resonance, and correspond to an integrated luminosity of approximately 468 fb \u22121 . We measure \u2206m+ = (140 601.0 \u00b1 6.8[stat] \u00b1 12.9[syst]) keV. We combine this result with a previous BABAR measurement of \u2206m0 \u2261 m(D * (2010) + ) \u2212 m(D 0 ) to obtain \u2206mD = m(D + ) \u2212 m(D 0 ) = (4 824.9 \u00b1 6.8[stat] \u00b1 12.9[syst]) keV. These results are compatible with and approximately five times more precise than the Particle Data Group averages.",

Its value is reported by the Particle Data Group (PDG) [4] to be \u2206m D = (4.77 \u00b1 0.08) MeV. The most precise direct measurement, reported by the LHCb Collaboration, is \u2206m D = (4.76 \u00b1 0.12 \u00b1 0.07) MeV [5]. This was found by comparing the invariant mass distributions of D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 K + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + and D + \u2192 K \u2212 K + \u03c0 + decays. A more powerful constraint comes from the difference of measured D * + \u2192 D + \u03c0 0 and D * + \u2192 D 0 \u03c0 + mass difference distributions. CLEO has previously reported \u2206m + \u2261 m(D * (2010) + ) \u2212 m(D + ) = (140.64 \u00b1 0.08 \u00b1 0.06) MeV using the decay chain D * + \u2192 D + \u03c0 0 with D + \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + [6]. In the present paper we report a new measurement of \u2206m + and combine it with our previously measured D * + \u2192 D 0 \u03c0 + mass difference [7,8]",

The BABAR detector is described in detail elsewhere [10,11]. The momenta of charged particles are measured with a combination of a cylindrical drift chamber (DCH) and a 5-layer silicon vertex tracker (SVT), both operating within the 1.5 T magnetic field of a superconducting solenoid. Information from a ring-imaging Cherenkov detector is combined with specific ionization (dE/dx) measurements from the SVT and DCH to identify charged kaon and pion candidates. Electrons are identified, and photons from \u03c0 0 decays are measured, with a CsI(Tl) electromagnetic calorimeter (EMC).

In the \u03c0 0 s \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 reconstruction, we first require both photon energies to be above 60 MeV, the total energy to be greater than 200 MeV, and the diphoton invariant mass to be between 120 MeV and 150 MeV (approximately \u00b12.5\u03c3 around the nominal \u03c0 0 mass [4]). After the selection, each photon pair is kinematically fitted to the hypothesis of a \u03c0 0 originating from the event primary vertex, and with the diphoton mass constrained to the nominal \u03c0 0 mass. This greatly improves the reconstructed \u03c0 0 momentum resolution, and therefore the \u2206m resolution. The \u03c0 0 relative momentum resolution after the kinematic fit is \u03c3 p /p \u223c3%; this is still considerably worse than the approximately 0.5% D + relative momentum resolution.",

The standard MC energy calibration method that accounts for energy loss in the EMC differs from that used with real data. This results in a reconstructed \u03c0 0 mass (m \u03b3\u03b3 ) peak in MC events that peaks about 0.5 MeV below the nominal mass for low energy \u03c0 0 s. In contrast, the m \u03b3\u03b3 peak value from the calibrated data events generally coincides with the nominal value. Therefore, we approximate the neutral energy correction algorithm used in data by rescaling the reconstructed photon energies in MC events by factors depending on photon energy and data-taking period [11]. While this improves the data-MC agreement, the reconstructed \u03c0 0 momentum in MC events remains slightly biased when compared with its generated value. To account for this bias, we also rescale the \u03c0 0 momentum in each MC event by approximately 0.2%, depending on the diphoton opening angle. In addition to improving the data-MC agreement in peak positions and shapes of the background-subtracted m \u03b3\u03b3 distributions, these MC corrections substantially improve the agreement in kinematic distributions, as described below.",

As in Ref. [7], we reject candidates with any D + daughter track for which the cosine of the polar angle measured in the laboratory frame cos \u03b8 t is above 0.89; this criterion reduces the final sample by approximately 10%. To further suppress peaking background events, we use a likelihood variable to select D + candidates, based on measured decay vertex separation from the primary vertex, and on Dalitz-plot position. This likelihood criterion rejects about 70% of background events with incorrectly reconstructed D + , while retaining about 77% of signal events. Figure 1 shows the m K\u03c0\u03c0 distribution for data events passing all selection criteria except for the requirement on m K\u03c0\u03c0 . For illustrative purposes, we fit the m K\u03c0\u03c0 distribution by modeling the D + signal with a sum of two Gaussian functions sharing a common mean, and random background events with a linear function. After all selection criteria, the fraction of candidates with a correctly reconstructed D + , as estimated from the m K\u03c0\u03c0 fit, is about 95%.",

The sum (\u2206m + + \u03b4 \u2206m+ ) is therefore the common peak position of the three PDFs. In the fit to the high-statistics MC sample (Fig. 2(a)), \u2206m + is fixed at the generated value of 140.636 MeV, and \u03b4 \u2206m+ is a measure of the possible bias induced by our event selection procedure, or the chosen form for the resolution function. The fitted functional distribution provides a reasonably good description of the data (with \u03c7 2 /\u03bd = 605/491 for a sample more than 7 times larger than the data). The fit gives \u03b4 \u2206m+ = (+16.6 \u00b1 2.5) keV, with the uncertainty from the limited size of our MC sample. The fit results for the shape parameters are shown in Fig. 2(a); and the full-width at half maximum (FWHM) of the resolution function is found to be about 2.1 MeV, which is mainly due to the resolution of the \u03c0 0 s . The second step (Fig. 2(b)) is an unbinned maximumlikelihood fit to real data using the PDF from the first step to model signal, and a threshold function to model the combinatorial background [13]:",

Furthermore, we divide our data into four disjoint subsets of data-taking periods. For the data fit in each subset, the value of \u03b4 \u2206m+ is determined separately from signal MC events with the same event selection criteria as for that subset. This is meant to expose possible detector response effects that have not been modeled in the simulation. We search for variations larger than those expected from statistical fluctuations based on a method similar to the PDG scale factor [4,8]. If the fit results from a given dependence study are compatible with a constant value, in the sense that \u03c7 2 /\u03bd < 1, where \u03bd is the number of degrees of freedom, we assign no systematic uncertainty. In the case that \u03c7 2 /\u03bd > 1, we ascribe an uncertainty of \u03c3 sys = \u03c3 stat \u03c7 2 /\u03bd \u2212 1 to account for unidentified detector effects. We observe \u03c7 2 /\u03bd > 1 in the cases of p lab , cos \u03b8 and \u03b8 \u03b3\u03b3 (shown in [14]). Systematic uncertainties of 5.0 keV, 6.9 keV, and 6.1 keV are assigned for the D * + p lab , D * + cos \u03b8, and \u03b8 \u03b3\u03b3 dependences, respectively, for which the p-values for the null hypotheses are 0.12, 0.03, and 0.06.
