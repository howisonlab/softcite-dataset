            "text": "This paper presents a search for narrow diboson resonances in the semileptonic decay channel Z W or Z Z \u2192 qq (where stands for electron or muon) in pp collision data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 20 fb \u22121 recorded with the ATLAS detector at a centre-of-mass energy \u221a s = 8 TeV at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). This type of resonances appear in models such as Technicolor [1][2][3], Warped Extra Dimensions [4][5][6], and Grand Unified Theories [7][8][9][10]. The semileptonic decay channel has a relatively large branching ratio compared to the fully leptonic mode, while the requirement of the presence of two decay leptons can suppress the multijet background present in the fully hadronic mode. Additionally, the absence of neutrinos in the final state allows to reconstruct the invariant mass of the diboson system. This analysis is optimized using two models with narrow resonances as benchmarks: spin-2 Kaluza-Klein (KK) gravitons (G * \u2192 Z Z), and spin-1 W gauge bosons (W \u2192 Z W ) of the Sequential Standard Model (SSM) with modified coupling to Z W , also referred to as the Extended Gauge Model (EGM) [11]. For both models, the W and Z bosons from resonance decays are longitudinally polarized over a pole mass range relevant to this analysis. e-mail: atlas.publications@cern.ch",

The D0 Collaboration searched for resonances in W W and Z W production [13,14] and excluded W bosons in the mass range of 180-690 GeV and RS1 gravitons in the mass interval 300-754 GeV at the 95 % confidence level (CL). The CDF experiment searched for resonances in the Z Z decay channel and set limits on the production cross section of RS1 gravitons in the mass range 300-1000 GeV at the 95 % CL [15]. The ATLAS Collaboration reported searches for resonant Z Z (\u2192 , qq) [16], W W (\u2192 \u03bdqq) [17] and W Z (\u2192 \u03bdqq, \u03bd ) [17,18] production, and searches for new phenomena in high-mass W W (\u2192 \u03bd \u03bd ) processes [19] using pp collision data recorded at \u221a s = 7 TeV, except for the W Z \u2192 \u03bd search in Ref. [18], which used data recorded at \u221a s = 8 TeV. Here stands for an electron or muon. These studies excluded EGM W bosons with masses up to 1.52 TeV for W Z final states, RS1 gravitons with masses up to 845 GeV for Z Z final states and up to 1.23 TeV for W W final states. The CMS Collaboration searched for Z Z and W W resonances in the semileptonic decay channel, setting exclusion limits on the production cross section of bulk RS gravitons [20]. In the fully hadronic channel, the CMS Collaboration excluded RS1 gravitons with k/M Pl = 0.1 for masses up to 1.2 TeV, and W bosons for masses up to 1.7 TeV [21]. Both of these searches implement jet substructure techniques to identify the event topology where the hadronic system from the decay of one or two gauge bosons is produced at high transverse momentum p T , resulting in a single reconstructed jet. In the analysis presented here, a similar technique has been used to identify hadronically decaying W or Z boson produced at high p T . This technique uses the characteristics of two cores (\"subjets\") inside a single reconstructed jet and allows for a significant improvement in acceptance and selection efficiency for high mass states with boosted W and Z bosons over the previous analysis [16].",

In the MR, additional jet substructure information, optimized for the identification of the hadronic decay of a longitudinally polarized high-p T boson, is used to improve the sensitivity. Finally, the qq mass spectrum, reconstructed as the mass of the dilepton and the two-jet system in the LR and HR (m j j ) or the dilepton and the single-jet system in the MR (m J ), is examined for excesses with respect to the expectation from SM processes (background).",

            "text": "To model the acceptance and the reconstructed mass spectra for narrow resonances, benchmark signal samples are generated with pole masses between 300 and 2000 GeV, in 100 GeV steps. Additional samples are generated between 350 and 950 GeV for the bulk RS G * signal so that the mass gap is reduced to 50 GeV, which is comparable to the detector resolution of the reconstructed qq mass in this mass interval. The bulk RS G * signal events are generated by CalcHEP [24] with k/M Pl = 1.0, and the W signal sample is generated with Pythia 8 [25], setting the coupling scale factor c = 1. The factorization and renormalization scales are set to the resonance mass. The hadronisation and fragmentation are modelled with Pythia 8 in both cases, and the CTEQ6L1 [26] (MSTW2008LO [27]) parton distribution functions (PDFs) are used for the G * (W ) signal. The W production cross section is scaled to a next-to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO) calculation in \u03b1 s by ZWprod [28]. Calculated production cross section times branching ratio values for different pole masses are given in Table 1.",

Additionally, the main background source, Z + jets, is estimated using constraints from data as described in Sect. 2.4. The Z + jets background is modelled by the Sherpa generator [29] with CT10 PDFs [30]. The top pair, s-channel single-top and W t processes are modelled by the MC@NLO [31][32][33][34] generator with CT10 PDFs, interfaced to Herwig [35,36] for hadronisation and Jimmy [37] for modelling of the underlying event.

Generated events are processed with the ATLAS detector simulation program [47] based on the GEANT4 package [48].

If the resulting uncertainty is smaller than the statistical uncertainty of the normalization correction from the nominal control region, the latter is used as the systematic uncertainty. The uncertainty of the shape correction is estimated from the uncertainty on the slope parameter of the linear fit and is treated as uncorrelated with respect to the normalization uncertainty. The combined normalization and shape uncertainties vary as a function of m j j/J and range from 6 to 9 % in the LR, 2 to 8 % in the HR, and 11 to 47 % in the MR. For all simulated samples, detector performance-related systematic uncertainties including the small-R jet energy scale and resolution, large-R jet energy, mass and momentum-balance scales and resolutions, the lepton reconstruction and identification efficiencies, and lepton momentum scales and resolutions are also considered. The large-R jet energy and mass scale uncertainties are evaluated by comparing the ratio of calorimeter-based to trackbased measurements in dijet data and simulated events, and are validated using a data sample of high-p T W bosons produced in association with jets. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test [57] is then performed between the nominal and systematically varied distributions for a given systematic uncertainty source to determine if it has a sizeable effect on the shape of background and signal estimations. Only significant systematic effects are retained in the analysis by requiring a KS probability of less then 10 %. For the normalization, if the event yield changes by more than half the statistical uncertainty of the nominal yield, the systematic uncertainty is included.",

No significant excess over the Standard Model background expectation was found. Upper limits on the production cross section times branching ratio and mass exclusion limits are derived for W bosons in the theoretical framework of an Extended Gauge Model and for gravitons in warped extra dimensions in the context of the bulk Randall-Sundrum model. The results represent a significant improvement over previously reported limits by ATLAS [16] due to increased pp collision energy and data set size as well as the development of new techniques to analyse heavily boosted decays of bosons.",
