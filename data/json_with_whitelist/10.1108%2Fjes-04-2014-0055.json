Given the data, the choice of parameters determines everyone's welfare and then the distribution, which can be used to conduct some research on inequality or implement some policy analysis. However, there is no wide consensus on how to choose these parameters. In this paper, we will choose the parameters using a method similar to calibration, which can be included in the category \"Hedonic Weights\" in Decancq and Lugo's (2013) paper. Simply speaking, we search the whole parameter space to find the set of parameters making the distance of reported happiness and objective measures of individual welfare smallest. To measure the distance between reported happiness and welfare, we adopt the two methods mentioned in Section 3. Given individuals' attributes and parameters, we can calculate individuals' welfare S i 's, which can be seen as continuous variables across observations. To compare the individuals' welfare with their reported happiness, we transform individuals' welfare into discrete variables. ",
