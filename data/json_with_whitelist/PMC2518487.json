The results are the percent of CD8 \u0609 /TCR \u060a FC total from three separate experiments. C: The morphology of FCs was examined using Wright-Giemsa staining under optical microscopy after CpG-ODN stimulation. D: p-preDC FCs were cultured with CpG-ODN or medium only. Culture cell-free supernatants were collected after 18 h and MIP-1\u2423/CCL3, RANTES/CCL5, IP-10, IL-6, GM-CSF, and TNF-\u2423 were measured by LINCO plex multiplex immunoassay. Data showed an average of two separate experiments.",
