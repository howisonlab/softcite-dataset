The atomic structure of human EC (PDB ID: 4BOC (24)) is fitted into the 3D reconstruction (correlation coefficient 0.74). (B) As in (A), but for a 3D reconstruction generated from negatively stained particles. The atomic structure of human EC (PDB ID: 4BOC (24)) is fitted into the 3D reconstruction (correlation coefficient 0.84). (C) As in (B), but for ECs prepared with an MtRNAP from which the first N-terminal 243 residues were deleted (spRNAPIV EC). The atomic structure of human EC (PDB ID: 4BOC (24)) is fitted into the 3D reconstruction (correlation coefficient 0.92). (D) Left: schematic representation of EC DNA scaffold used in (24). Template and non-template strands are dyed in cyan and yellow, respectively. Cyan: 28 nts long non-template strand with nucleotides not visible in X-ray structure indicated by dashed squares; Orange-yellow: 28 nts long template strand with nucleotide not visible in X-ray structure indicated by dashed square; Red: 14nts long RNA. Underlined nucleotides are ones that form a transcription bubble. Right: docking of the human MtRNAPEC (PDB ID: 4BOC) in the cryo-EM map of yeast MtRNAPEC, obtained in this study. Template and non-template strands are dyed in cyan and yellow, respectively. Upstream (5 NT) and downstream (5 T) DNA termini are emphasized with spheres colored in yellow and cyan respectively. (E) Left: schematic representation of EC DNA scaffold used in this study, aligned with the DNA presented in (A), using the upstream edge of transcription bubble as a reference, alignment point. 21 nts long template and non-template strands are dyed in orange (yellow) and cyan, respectively, while 10 nts long RNA in red. Underlined nucleotides are ones that form a transcription bubble. Right: docking of the human MtRNAPEC (PDB ID: 4BOC) in the cryo-EM map, obtained in this study. Template and non-template strands are dyed in cyan and yellow, respectively. Positions of the upstream (5 NT) and downstream (5 T) DNA termini, shown with spheres colored in yellow and cyan respectively, are adjusted according to the alignment. (F) Difference map in which the 3D reconstruction of negatively stained EC was subtracted from the 3D reconstruction obtained from EC particles in which the downstream DNA end was labeled with streptavidin ('downstream streptavidin EC'). The scale bar indicates a difference in positions of expected, theoretical (blue spheres) and experimental (streptavidin) downstream end of DNA (5 terminus of NT strand) (G) Difference map in which the 3D reconstruction of negatively stained spRNAPIV EC was subtracted from the 3D reconstruction obtained from spRNAPIV EC particles in which the downstream DNA end was labeled with streptavidin ('downstream streptavidin spRNAPIV EC') (H) As in (F), but this time the subtraction is performed between the 3D reconstruction of EC and a 3D reconstruction of EC in which the upstream end of the DNA is streptavidin-labeled ('upstream streptavidin EC'). Figure 6. Displacement of the upstream end of DNA during the IC-EC transition. (A) Difference map (gray volume) generated by subtracting the IC from the upstream streptavidin IC with the atomic structure of streptavidin (gray) placed on the large density difference. The docked atomic structure of human MtRNAPEC (PDB ID: 4BOC, DNA not shown) and the DNA of aligned T7RNAPIC (3E2E) are shown and labeled as in Figure 5. (B) As in (A) but the subtraction is between EC and 'upstream streptavidin EC'. (C) Cleavage patterns of Fe-BABE molecules conjugated to the mtRNAP suggest conformational differences between the N-terminal domains of the IC and EC. Each panel shows the cleavages on either the NT-or T-strands, as indicated, in reactions with mtRNAP conjugated with Fe-BABE at the indicated residue positions. 'G/A' = markers used to map the cleavage sites with respect to the +1 transcription start site; '\u2212' and '+' refer, respectively, to absence or addition of ascrobate/peroxide to activate cleavage (low levels of cutting are seen even in the absence of ascorbate/peroxide). NTPs allowing RNA extension to 0-13 nt, as indicated, were added to the reactions. Each panel also shows the MtRNAP structure in surface representation with \u2212, + and uncharged regions in red, blue, and white, respectively. The DNA is in stick representation with the T-strand in green and the NT-strand in cyan. The position of the residue(s) to which Fe-BABE was conjugated is labeled and highlighted in yellow, and the centers of the sites of cleavage by those conjugates are indicated by showing the corresponding DNA nucleotides in space-filling representation (T-strand cleavage by conjugates at residues 780, 1025, 1074 and 1078 is not shown as it was very low, likely reflecting the fact that the proximal part of the T-strand is buried in the template binding cleft and inaccessible). Values were determined by measuring the rate of dinucleotide synthesis in reactions with ATP only, or the rates of incorporation of NTPs into all transcripts ('Total') or only runoff transcript in reactions with all four NTPs (three NTPs at constant concentration and ATP varied). Deletion of the MTF1 C-terminus is seen to markedly increase K ATP for initiation on duplex, but not bubble, templates.",
