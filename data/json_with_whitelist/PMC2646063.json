Second, NCD and post-MK0431 Tx groups showed significantly attenuated PET The effect of sDPP-IV on cAMP accumulation and the involvement of cAMP/PKA/Rac1 pathway in DPP-IV-mediated CD4 \u0609 T-cells migration. A: DPP-IV-mediated cAMP accumulation. Splenic CD4 \u0609 T-cells were stimulated for 30 min with GIP, 100 nmol/l GLP-1, or 100 mU/ml purified porcine DPP-IV in the presence of 0.5 mmol/l IBMX, and cAMP concentrations were determined in the cell extracts. B: Effect of MK0431 on DPP-IVmediated PKA activation. Splenic CD4 \u0609 T-cells were treated with 100 mU/ml purified porcine DPP-IV in the presence of indicated concentration of MK0431, and PKA activity was determined. C: Effect of MK0431 on 6-Bnz-cAMP-mediated PKA activation. Splenic CD4 \u0609 T-cells were treated with 100 mol/l 6-Bnz-cAMP in the presence of indicated concentration of MK0431, and PKA was activity determined. D: Effect of PKA inhibition on DPP-IV-mediated T-cell migration. CD4 \u0609 T-cells were stimulated for 1 h with 100 mU/ml DPP-IV or 10 mol/l forskolin in the presence or absence of 10 mol/l H-89, and cell migration was determined. E: Effect of PKA inhibition on DPP-IV-mediated Rac1 activation. CD4 \u0609 T-cells were treated as described above, and Rac1 GTP binding activity was determined. All data represent means \u060e SE, and significance was tested using ANOVA with a Newman-Keuls post hoc test, where **P < 0.05 vs. control and ##P < 0.05 vs. DPP-IV.",
