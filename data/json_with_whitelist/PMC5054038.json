In order to generate asymmetries in a controlled fashion in the fold-change distributions, the HT29( 1) dataset was modified according to two distinct procedures to generate: (1) A dataset with ever increasing perturbations at ever larger distance to a=O, and with a constant and small variance over the perturbation (Figure 5; see Materials and Methods). This dataset was used to simultaneously test the performance and the robustness of the NeONORM method. Having up to a quarter of all probe signals artificially induced with a logQ average of up to 21.5, and a con-stant <logR>/<variance> ratio of 0.1, this dataset resulted in highly significant perturbations easily detectable in the sign plots shown in Figure 5 (Supporting online material: \"HT29( 1)robustness.txt\").",
