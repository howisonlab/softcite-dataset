The conventional EBSD map yields the full information on the crystal orientation at each point of the map where only the indexing of the Kikuchi pattern is performed immediately after the pattern acquisition by the acquisition software. Additionally, also the type of grain boundaries can be displayed by the conventional EBSD data managing program ( Figure 5A). For the detection of a LAGB, a critical angle has to be defined for the misorientation of the crystal lattice at two adjacent measuring points. A minimum value of 1\u00b0 was proven to be appropriate. For the LAGB indicated in the EBSD map, the misorientation angle is 4.5\u00b0. The EBIC-image of the same sample area ( Figure 5B) was measured at RT. The incoherent \u03a33 grain boundaries and the LAGB appear here as dark lines. This effect is caused by the locally increased carrier recombination. From the contrast profile of the EBIC signal across the LAGB (cf., Figure 5H), a diffusion length of (60 \u00b1 12) \u00b5m and a recombination velocity of (4.1 \u00b1 0.4) x 10 4 cm sec -1 were determined for the minority charge carriers in the framework of the model by Donolato",
