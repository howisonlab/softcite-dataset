Additionally, also the type of grain boundaries can be displayed by the conventional EBSD data managing program ( Figure 5A). For the detection of a LAGB, a critical angle has to be defined for the misorientation of the crystal lattice at two adjacent measuring points. A minimum value of 1\u00b0 was proven to be appropriate. For the LAGB indicated in the EBSD map, the misorientation angle is 4.5\u00b0. The EBIC-image of the same sample area ( Figure 5B) was measured at RT. The incoherent \u03a33 grain boundaries and the LAGB appear here as dark lines. This effect is caused by the locally increased carrier recombination. From the contrast profile of the EBIC signal across the LAGB (cf., Figure 5H), a diffusion length of (60 \u00b1 12) \u00b5m and a recombination velocity of (4.1 \u00b1 0.4) x 10 4 cm sec -1 were determined for the minority charge carriers in the framework of the model by Donolato",

The single dark points in the EBIC image, spread over the entire sample surface and concentrated especially in the vicinity of the LAGB, indicate the positions of threading dislocations. In CL imaging investigations at 4 K, the LAGB appears dark in the mono-CL image at band-to-band transition energies (Figure 5C), as expected, but surprisingly also in a mono-CL image at the energy of the D4 band ( Figure 4D) which is usually assigned to dislocations. However, the LAGB looks bright in a mono-CL image at a wavelength of 1,530 nm corresponding to the D1/D2 luminescence bands ( Figure 5E). This luminescence behavior is believed to be induced by point defects in the neighborhood of the dislocations constituting the LAGB. Additionally, the ccEBSD procedure was performed as a line scan across the LAGB to determine its local strain field. The electron beam acceleration voltage was reduced to 10 kV to increase the spatial resolution for the strain determination at the expense of an increased total acquisition time for each Kikuchi pattern. The normal and the shear strain components, shown in Figures 5F and 5G, respectively, cannot be calculated for the center region of the LAGB (over about 50 nm) because double patterns appear that prevent an analysis of the Kikuchi patterns. Moreover, the EBSD patterns on both sides of the LAGB have to be correlated with two different reference patterns because the crosscorrelation method can only be applied for small variations of the diffraction pattern. So, two reference patterns were collected on the left hand side and on the right hand side of the LAGB due to the large misorientation angle between the two sub-grains. Nonetheless, it is exciting that the strain components behave symmetrically on both sides of the LAGB. The diagrams for the position dependence of the strain components show that the range of the strain field of the LAGB extends to about 350 nm into both sub-grains. On the contrary, the diagram of the locally varying contrast in the band-to-band transition mono-CL image, and of the EBIC signal contrast in the EBIC image ( Figure 5H), indicates that the influence of the LAGB on the luminescence signal and on the EBIC signal ranges up to \u00b1 10 \u00b5m and \u00b1 1.5 \u00b5m from the center of the LAGB, respectively. This verifies the statement from the beginning that the local resolution for the investigation of different properties of extended defects strongly depends on the experimental method and parameters applied.   Figure 2A) imaged by back-scattered electrons (BSE). These results show plastic deformation for different slip systems. In Figures 2D and 2E, the mono-CL images for the D4 line and D3 line are shown, respectively, with each measured for the same sample region below that shown in the BSEimage ( Figure 2C).
