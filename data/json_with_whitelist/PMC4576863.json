(A-C) Representative traces of LVDP before (baseline considered as 100%) and after BDNF or caffeine injection (arrows) in control myosin 6-specific cre transgenic (myh6-cre) mice used as controls (A), double Myh6-cre, TrkB.T1 conditional (Myh6-cre/TrkB.T1 loxP ; B), and endothelial-specific cre (Cdh5-cre) TrkB.T1 conditional (Cdh5cre/TrkB.T1 loxP ; C) mutant mice. Caffeine was injected 5 min after BDNF as a positive control as in Fig. 2. The BDNF and caffeine traces were overlapped using the injection time An important new contribution of our study relates to the fact that we have identified the source and identity of the neurotrophin activating TrkB.T1 in the heart. This is relevant because other neurotrophins expressed in the heart could be responsible for this function (Scarisbrick et al., 1993;Emanueli et al., 2014). Moreover, our data suggest that BDNF produced in loco is a significant determinant of TrkB.T1 cardiac function. This was even more surprising considering the relatively low level of BDNF present in the heart compared with the brain (only \u223c5% per gram of tissue; Fig. 6 A). In the future it will be of interest to investigate whether BDNF produced by peripheral districts (i.e., striatal muscle) can affect cardiac function and whether loss of either cardiac or peripheral BDNF is sufficient to cause cardiomyopathy.",
