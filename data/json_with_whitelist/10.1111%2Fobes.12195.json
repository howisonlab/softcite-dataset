We further show the usefulness of our approach and the benefits of the conditional system analysis in two empirical illustrations, both based on the estimation of VAR systems on US quarterly data. Overall, our analysis shows the gains of combining information criteria with partial system analysis.

In this case, we have included in Z t as initial step of the analysis a set of conditioning variables (the fixed-private investments and the inflation rate) which are expected to be I(1) but not co-integrated. Albeit Z t can potentially be co-integrated in our setup (see Remark 3 and Table 3), our suggestion is that it may be convenient to start the analysis with this choice because it is often easier to make conjectures on which variables are likely to be no co-integrated, rather than on which variables should not adjust to the long run equilibria. Modelling Y t conditional on Z t requires considering a five-dimensional system as in equation (2) and, notably, we can apply BIC and HQC ignoring the weak exogeneity condition of Z t . Results are reported in the middle panel of Table 5, which also reports, for completeness, the outcome of HJNR's sequential procedure. Although the asymptotic critical values associated with HJNR's test are computed under the assumption of weak exogeneity of Z t , the Monte Carlo evidence summarized in Tables 1-4 has shown that HJNR's test performs reasonably well in samples of length T = 100 irrespective of whether Z t is weakly exogenous or not (or co-integrated or",
