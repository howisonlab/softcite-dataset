Two DNA constructs were used; 16X11 can accommodate 2:1 binding as seen in the crystal structure, while 3X11 cannot ( Figure 1). The target nucleotide (x = U F , T F , AP, T or C) is paired with guanine (bold) and placed in a CpG dinucleotide context, in keeping with the specificity of TDG. The DNA contains no other CpG site. The DNA was labeled at the 5 0 end of the non-target strand (*) with sulforhodamine (also called Texas Red or TR) for anisotropy experiments or with fluorescein for EMSAs. The 28 bp nonspecific DNA (NS28) contains no mispair or CpG site. synthesized and purified (RP-HPLC) by the Midland Certified Reagent Co. (Midland, TX, USA).",
