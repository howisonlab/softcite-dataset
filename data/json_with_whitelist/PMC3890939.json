Since the magnetic transition is strongly coupled with the structural distortion in the SrFe 2 As 2 system at ambient pressure, studying its magnetic ordering, structural distortions, and superconductivity at high pressures and low temperatures under controlled hydrostatic conditions can provide valuable insight into intrinsic underlying mechanism for the origin of superconductivity in the system. Here we have investigated the magnetic and structural transitions of SrFe 2 As 2 using synchrotron M\u00f6ssbauer spectoscopy (SMS) and x-ray diffraction (XRD) in a cryogenically-cooled high-pressure diamond anvil cell (DAC) having a relatively hydrostatic Ne pressure medium. Our results show that the magnetic and structural transitions of SrFe  57 Fe nuclear level through hyperfine interaction, showing the AFM state. As pressure was increased to 4.3 GPa, the SMS spectrum changed significantly with the disappearance of the quantum beats, indicating that the magnetic phase had been suppressed via applied pressure at 15 K while the PM state started to appear. Since the spectrum could not be reasonably fitted using only paramagnetic or magnetic phases, both paramagnetic and magnetic phases were used to model the SMS spectrum at 4.3 GPa. Analyses of the modeled results showed that the magnetic phase accounts for approximately 42 vol.% of the two phases. At a higher pressure of approximately 5.4 GPa, the 57 Fe nuclear level is characterized by flat spectral features without any splitting quantum beats, indicating the sole existence of the PM state with the completely suppressed magnetism by pressure. The derived hyperfine parameters show an abrupt increase in the strength of the magnetic fields as a function of temperature at a given pressure ( Fig. 1(b)). ",
