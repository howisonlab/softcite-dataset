This decomposition picks out a different linear combination of the aggregate demand shocks, but since only their joint effect is identified, this difference is inessential. 13.Blanchard and Quah (1988) use a different technique to estimate models subject to these long-run Wold causal orderings. They estimate the unrestricted vector autoregression for X, and then transform the system by post-multiplying the VAR by a matrix that imposes the necessary restrictions on the long-run multipliers and the residual covariance matrix. There is unique matrix that simultaneously diagonalizes the VAR innovation covariance matrix and triangularizes the matrix of long-run multipliers. When the only constraints on the system are a lower triangular matrix of long-run multipliers and a diagonal innovation covariance matrix, the model is just-identified, and this procedure can be thought of as \"indirect least squares.\" ",

These overidentifying restrictions are easy to impose in our instrumental variable approach, but are much more difficult to impose in the indirect least squares approach.This content downloaded from 146.006.168.120 on May 18, 2018 14:21:07 PM All use subject to University of Chicago Press Terms and Conditions (http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/t-and-c).",
