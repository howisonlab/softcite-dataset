These lists were obtained from sources with software names. Their intended use was to identify "mention rich" parts of articles for further manual annotation of software mentions.

The "go" lists indicate words whose presence should include the sentence.

The "stop" lists indicate words which were in the "go" lists, but which seem very ambiguous.  The manual_james list was generated by James informally reading chunks selected by these phrases and not seeing any actual software mentions.
