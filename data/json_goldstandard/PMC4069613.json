The result is a high-confidence data set for recently derived tandem duplications in data that effectively surveys the majority of the assayable genome. This high coverage is essential in ensuring valid results from the sole use of paired-end read orientation. However, the types of duplications that can be detected are highly dependent on sequencing library insert size. For breakpoints with large amounts of repetitive sequence, reads separated by 300 bp may not be sufficient to overcome difficulties of read mapping. Additionally, the minimum duplication size is also limited by insert size. Capturing these types of constructs using paired-end reads, especially in organisms with large amounts of repetitive content, including nested TEs, will require a more diverse range of library insert sizes, a factor that is likely to be important for surveys of larger, more repetitive genomes.",
