In particular, the Drosophila midgut has emerged as an excellent model system to study the influence of different signaling pathways and environmental challenges on the biology of intestinal stem cells (ISCs) during aging (reviewed in [6][7][8][9][10] ). The Drosophila intestinal epithelium has a high turnover rate and is renewed every two weeks in females and about once a month in males 11 . ISCs residing in the Drosophila midgut have the capacity to divide and produce a self-renewed ISC and a post-mitotic progenitor cell called the enteroblast (EB) 12,13 . The EB differentiates into either an absorptive enterocyte or a secretory enteroendocrine cell. To this date, the only marker combination that unambiguously labels an ISC is the expression of the transcription factor escargot (esg) and the Notch ligand Delta (Dl) 14 . However, this only holds true for a young and healthy gut. During aging, the midgut epithelium is characterized by an increase in ISC proliferation [15][16][17] . Additionally, aberrant Notch signaling disrupts the fate decision of ISC daughter cells and induces misdifferentiation of EBs of cells that are active for Notch signaling and co-express esg and Dl, thereby rendering Dl expression insufficient to identify bona fide stem cells in an aged midgut. The difficulty in identifying true ISCs has impeded the ability to examine endogenous changes in aging ISCs until now.",
