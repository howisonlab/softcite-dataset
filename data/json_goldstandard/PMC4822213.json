PreAmp was performed with panels of assays which include PrimePCR PreAmp assays (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA), assays culled from public databases, assays designed using online software tools and assays from published manuscripts (Supplemental Fig. 1); primers were at a final concentration of 50 nM each.
