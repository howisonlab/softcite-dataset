(p. 87) One possible explanation for this puzzle is that the rule of law is not such a great thing. Perhaps we have overestimated its ability to increase income or underestimated its distributional consequences, in particular, those that cannot be undone by credible commitments to redistribute. For example, the traditional view of the enclosure of the commons in England was that it created large, dispersed benefits. Yet Weitzman (1974) showed that most people could be worse off under the efficient enclosure than under inefficient free access rights. 4 The establishment of the rule of law in a lawless state is a more compelling example of a reform that should engender widespread support, since it is a movement from the jungle to order. Political philosophers from Hobbes to Nozick clearly viewed this kind of reform as an improvement. Economists have argued that although private, relation-based governance may suffice for a middle-income country, the rule of law is necessary to make the transition to a high-income country (Rodrik, 2003, p. 17;Dixit, 2004, p. 82). Yet, as Figure 1 illustrates, many societies do not seem to be moving towards the rule of law.",
