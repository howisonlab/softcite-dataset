This dataset was used to simultaneously test the performance and the robustness of the NeONORM method. Having up to a quarter of all probe signals artificially induced with a logQ average of up to 21.5, and a con-stant <logR>/<variance> ratio of 0.1, this dataset resulted in highly significant perturbations easily detectable in the sign plots shown in Figure 5 (Supporting online material: \"HT29( 1)robustness.txt\").",
