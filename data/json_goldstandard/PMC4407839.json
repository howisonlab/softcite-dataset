The more sophisticated genetic tools, imaging methods, and versatile software programs used for this work enable unambiguous visualization of 18 glomeruli in both adult brains immunolabeled with nc82 (which recognizes the synaptic protein, Bruchpilot) as well as in brains in which the MCFO strategy was used to label random subsets of cells, thereby highlighting each glomerulus in a distinct color from its neighbors (Movies 1 and 2). Eighteen glomeruli have been reliably counted in multiple GAL4 lines that label diverse cell types in the PB. Furthermore, this is not a sex-specific morphological phenomenon, since PBs from both male and female brains contain 18 glomeruli (Fig. 4). The partitioning of the PB into 18 segments is also evident in the pupal brain, as can be seen in figure 6J from Young and Armstrong (2010a). In their figure, the two medial glomeruli, while evident, are not targeted in the enhancer trap line used. Although anatomy does not predict function, the data presented here strongly suggest that G1, the medial glomerulus, and the likely glomerulus to have been overlooked in previous studies, is most certainly a functional unit given that: 1) it is targeted by various cell types (e.g.,",
