The fixed-effects model of meta-analysis was used in the case of statistical homogeneity, whereas in the case of statistical heterogeneity, the random-effects model was applied. Analysis and reporting followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. 27 Forest plots of SMDs for the assessed outcomes with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and funnel plots were generated. The latter were assessed for evidence of asymmetry and therefore possible reporting bias or publication bias. ",
