Table 4 revealed that in univariate linear regression, the environmental CO level (b: 0.16, 95% CI [0.91, 21.27]), blood Al level (b: 0.16, 95% CI [0.17, 3.91]), and blood WBC (b: 0.24, 95% CI [0.51, 1.98]) were positively associated with hs-CRP and serum albumin levels (b: \u00c00.22, 95% CI [\u00c012.95, \u00c02.78]), and log nPNA (b: \u00c00.24, 95% CI [\u00c050.47, \u00c012.75]) was negatively associated with hs-CRP level. Except for CO, the other air pollutants were not associated with hs-CRP level (P > 0.05). Furthermore, in the ''stepwise'' model of linear regression, after adjustment for related factors, blood WBC (b: 0.28, 95% CI [0.73, 2.12]) and CO level (b: 0.17, 95% CI [2.54, 21.27]) were positively associated with hs-CRP and serum albumin levels (b: \u00c00.25, 95% CI [\u00c013.51, \u00c03.93]), and log nPNA (b: \u00c00.18, 95% CI [\u00c017.25, \u00c02.33]) was negatively associated with hs-CRP level.
