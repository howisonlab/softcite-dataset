Both of these hints are consistent with oscillations driven by a \u2206m 2 > 1 eV 2  [29]. In order for the interpretation of these measurements to coexist with the well-established solar and atmospheric mass-splittings, at least one additional neutrino must be introduced. The LEP measurements further require that any additional neutrinos either be heavier than half the Z 0 mass, which would make it difficult for them to participate in oscillations, or not couple to the Z 0 boson, and hence not participate in weak interactions. These non-interacting neutrinos are called 'sterile.' * Deceased.",
