This allows for the precise determination of some parameters for some XYZ states, for example the natural width and line-shape measurements of very narrow resonances. Recently PANDA used the X(3872) as an example to study the achievable sensitivities of measuring its width, since an absolute width measurement is the key to understand the nature of the X(3872) and distinguish between the various theoretical models. For such a narrow state with J PC = 1 ++ , the PANDA experiment has a good ability to perform precise energy scans of the resonance regions. Based on a comprehensive MC simulation study, the achievable sensitivities of measuring X(3872) width are achieved by assuming 40 energy scan points and data-taking time period of two days per point [966].
