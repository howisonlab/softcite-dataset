This feature results from the isospin dependence of the summed branching fractions. Long ago, Pais [3] had calculated the isospin dependence of the decays containing neutral and charged pions, in particular the ratios of decays (n \u2212 2)\u03c0 \u00b1 2\u03c0 0 /n\u03c0 \u00b1 for n = 2 \u2212 8. In Table IV, we present the results from our measurements of \u03a5(1S) decays. It is interesting to note that not only do the results for pure pionic decays agree with Pais' predictions, but that the predictions hold even when the pions are accompanied by even numbers of kaons and protons.",
