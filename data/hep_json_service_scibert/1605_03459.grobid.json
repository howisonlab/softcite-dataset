The current and radius of the solenoid can be chosen to mimic the pole strength. The calibration was performed by passing a solenoid with different current through the magnetometer, measuring the induced current and subtracting the current induced at zero solenoid current. The current in the magnetometer following the passage of one end of the solenoid was found to increase linearly with the current in the solenoid. To simulate the magnetometer behaviour at the passage of a magnetic monopole, the long solenoid was attached to a beam-pipe section and the two passed jointly through the coil, allowing the passage of only one end of the solenoid through the magnetometer. The results are shown in Fig. 62, where the passage of the beam-pipe strip alone is compared to the passage of the same strip attached to a solenoid with a \"pseudopole\" strength of 2.3g D and \u22122.3g D .
