The diboson and single-top quark yields are predicted using PYTHIA and MADEVENT [16] MC samples, respectively, each normalized to the theoretical cross sections [17,18]. The residual Z \u00fe jets background is modeled using ALPGEN [19], with the parton showering and underlying event model from PYTHIA. The QCD background typically has lower E 6 T than events with real W bosons and is evaluated by fitting the E 6 T distribution using templates for QCD and W \u00fe jets sources and extrapolating the QCD fraction into the high-E 6 T signal region. ALPGEN is also used in the evaluation of the dominant background from W \u00fe jets production. The W \u00fe jets background is determined separately for events with and without heavy-flavor jets. For events with heavy-flavor jets we use the ALPGEN simulation to determine the fraction, in each jet multiplicity bin, of W \u00fe jets events that are Wb \" b, Wc \" c, or Wc. ",
