<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Soil salinity is one of the most severe abiotic stresses for crops worldwide, affecting several million hectares of agricultural land. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> Therefore, characterization of Na + transport and its distribution in plants has been a prime area of research for decades. High concentration of sodium ion (Na + ) is toxic to plants primarily due to its adverse effects on cellular metabolism and ion homeostasis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">3</ref> Therefore, maintenance of low level of Na + in cells is essential for plants. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">4</ref> Plants remove Na + from the cytoplasm by using vacuolar and plasma membrane localized Na + / H + transporters. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">5</ref> Na + /H + transporters are membranous proteins that transport protons (H + ) across the membrane in exchange for Na + . <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">7</ref> This exchange activity requires H + electrochemical gradient across the membrane which is generated by the H + pumps such as H + -ATPase present on plasma membrane or vacuole and H + -pyrophosphatase. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">5</ref> In plants, the exchange activity of the plant vacuolar Na + /H + transporters has been well studied. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">9</ref> In addition, enhanced salinity tolerance has been reported by overexpression of a vacuolar Na + /H + antiporter in Arabidopsis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">10</ref> In plants, three salt overly sensitive genes (SOS1, SOS2 and SOS3) have been found to function in a common pathway that contributes to salt tolerance. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[14]</ref> SOS1 gene encodes a membrane</p><p>The diurnal rhythm controls many aspects of plant physiology such as flowering, photosynthesis and growth. Rice is one of the staple foods for world's population. Abiotic stresses such as salinity, drought, heat and cold severely affect rice production. Under salinity stress, maintenance of ion homeostasis is a major challenge, which also defines the tolerance level of a given genotype. Salt overly sensitive (SOS) pathway is well documented to play a key role in maintaining the Na + homeostasis in plant cell. However, it is not reported yet whether the transcriptional regulation of genes of this pathway are influenced by diurnal rhythm. In the present work, we have studied the diurnal pattern of transcript of SOS pathway genes in rice at seedling stage. To rule out the effect of temperature fluctuations on the expression patterns of these genes, the seedlings were grown under constant temperature. We found that OsSOS3 and OsSOS2 exhibited a rhythmic and diurnal expression pattern, while OsSOS1 did not have any specific pattern of expression. This analysis establishes a cross-link between diurnal rhythm and SOS pathway and suggests that SOS pathway is influenced by diurnal rhythm in rice.</p></div>

Expression of SOS1 gene is induced significantly in roots and to a much lesser extent in shoots in seedlings by exposure to high levels of NaCl. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">15</ref> SOS2 is a Ser/Thr protein kinase, which contains an auto-inhibitory domain. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">16</ref> SOS3 is a Ca 2+ binding protein with strong similarity with the regulatory β subunit of the protein phosphatase calcineurin and with related proteins of the neuronal Ca 2+ sensor family. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">13</ref> Hence, it has been hypothesized that SOS3 perceives the Ca 2+ transients elicited by salt stress and activates SOS2 by relieving auto-inhibition. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">16</ref> These SOS pathway genes are later grouped into large protein families of calcineurin B-like proteins (CBL) and CBL-interacting protein kinases (CIPK), therefore SOS2 and SOS3 are also known as CIPK24 and CBL4, respectively. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">17</ref> Furthermore, the orthologous-OsSOS1, OsSOS2 (OsCIPK24) and OsSOS3 (OsCBL4) have also been isolated from rice and it has been demonstrated that all OsSOS proteins could coordinately function with AtSOS proteins and nicely complemented mutations in the corresponding sos mutant of Arabidopsis plants. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">18</ref> Recent work from our lab has also reported various SOS orthologs from Brassica species involved in maintenance of Na + with time but do not show a clear rhythmicity.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The biological clock is an endogenous timing mechanism present in almost all organisms examined to date. This time-keeping mechanism is able to generate 24 h rhythms in a wide variety of biological processes. Regulation of cellular ion homeostasis during stresses is critical for plant survival. One of the responses of plant cell to stresses is the generation of a cytosolic Ca 2+ transient and the subsequent activation of Ca 2+ sensor protein expression and/or activity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">32</ref> The components (SOS1, SOS2 and SOS3) of SOS pathway transduce a salt stress induced Ca 2+ signal to reinstate cellular ion homeostasis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">33</ref> Although, these three members (proteins) coordinate in sequential manner but do not show diurnal co-expression as OsSOS3 and OsSOS2 have expression peaks at different times of 24 h cycle; during night and dusk transition respectively, while OsSOS1 does not have a clear rhythmicity. It has been reported that changes in mRNA levels may not be correlated with changes in protein or enzyme activity levels. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">34</ref> It has also been suggested that the clock-regulated proteins in rice are modulated at not only transcriptional but also at post-transcriptional and/or post-translational levels. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">26</ref> Whether SOS2 and SOS3 show diurnal rhythm at protein level and whether specific activities of these proteins also oscillate during the 24 h day-night cycle, these are the important questions to be answered. Nevertheless, expression profiles do provide a useful starting point for more in depth analyses. For instance, in the present study, SOS2 and SOS3 represent good candidates to study the relationship between salinity stress and diurnal rhythm. Plants are always changing and adapting to their changing environments. Thus, experimental changes are always being observed in a background of uncertain variation. Although clocks are temperature compensated, which means that overall clock period is constant over a range of temperatures and temperature changes can act to entrain or reset the clock patterns. It has also been shown in Brassica juncea that BjSOS3 mRNA is downregulated in presence of calcium chelator EGTA. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">35</ref> It indicates that Ca 2+ has a dual role as signaling agent, controlling the expression of SOS pathway genes at transcript level and initiating signaling at protein level. Diurnal oscillations of cytosolic and chloroplastic Ca 2+ have been reported in A. thaliana and Nicotiana plumbaginifolia. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">36</ref> The relationship between this diurnally regulated Ca 2+ and SOS genes is still unexplored. The purpose of the diurnal oscillations of Ca 2+ is not known but it has been reportedly involved in regulating numerous signaling events. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">37</ref> Calcium is suggested to be a part of the light signal transduction chain regulating the rhythm as well as gene expression. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">37</ref> These reports are in support to our study, as we are also reporting a diurnal expression pattern of genes of SOS pathway which is related to Ca 2+ signaling.</p><p>As, the expression of SOS pathway genes and Ca 2+ ion level show rhythmic oscillation, it would be interesting to study whether the diurnal changes in Ca 2+ signatures mediate cross-talk homeostasis in Brassica. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">19</ref> Together, these results suggested that the SOS-like salinity tolerance mechanism is conserved in plants.</p><p>Plant diurnal oscillation is a 24 h period cycle. Genes of multiple pathways have been implicated in stress responses and regulated by diurnal rhythm. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[24]</ref> Time course transcriptome analysis has revealed that genes involved in several biological pathways like lipid and carbohydrate metabolic processes, photosynthesis, nucleotide binding, translation, amino acid and nucleotide metabolism, nitrogen metabolism and hormone biosynthesis, etc., show rhythmicity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[28]</ref> Rice, a salt sensitive crop, is the staple food for about half of the world's population.

Rice has been reported to be most sensitive to salinity stress at seedling stage. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">30</ref> The aim of the present study was to see if the expression of SOS pathway members is influenced by the diurnal rhythm in seedlings of rice.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>OsSOS3 and OsSOS2 show diurnal rhythmicity. The diurnal expression profiles of OsSOS genes were observed under entraining conditions of 12 h light/12 h dark (LD) with a constant temperature 28 ± 2°C during day and night in IR-64 genotype of rice at seedling stage. OsTOC1 has been reported to be expressed rhythmically during 12 h light and 12 h dark cycle in rice. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">31</ref> Level of mRNA of OsTOC1 oscillates with light-dark cycles and shows peak in the late day <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 1A)</ref>. Changes in OsTOC1 levels coincide with dusk transition as reported earlier. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">31</ref> OsTOC1 expresses with a period of about 24 h and an evening specific phase. This result is consistent with the prior published reports, which in turn validates the experimental conditions used by us.</p><p>The nucleotide sequences of the cDNA clones used for probe preparation were taken as query in BLASTN search in Rice Genome Annotation Project Database (http://rice.plantbiology. msu.edu/) which revealed that regions of clones used for probe preparation were specific to the corresponding genes, thus giving a clear signal on northern blots. In case of OsSOS genes, we found that OsSOS2 and OsSOS3 were expressed in diurnal manner. Diurnal rhythms of these two genes have a characteristic waveform, described by peaks and troughs. OsSOS3, with a phase of 24 h show higher expression level during night. Its expression shoots up in night and goes down during day, creating rhythmicity <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 1B)</ref>. Similarly, the transcript of OsSOS2 also shows a clear oscillation profile. MRNA levels of OsSOS2 cycles in lightdark periods, showing higher expression around the transition period of light to dark with a period of 24 h <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 1C)</ref>. The amplitude of OsSOS2 diurnal expression was higher in comparison to that of OsSOS3. mRNA level of OsSOS1 transcript fluctuates profiles in sos1, sos2 and sos3 mutants implicating this as transcriptional output requiring all components of the SOS pathway. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">39</ref> Expression of CCR1 as well as its homolog CCR2 is regulated by diurnal rhythm. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">40</ref> Not only downstream genes of SOS pathway, but also the interacting partners of SOS pathway show the diurnal rhythm. It has been reported that SOS2 interacts with catalase 2 (CAT2) and catalase 3 (CAT3) connecting SOS2 to H 2 O 2 metabolism and signaling. Expression of CAT2 is under circadian control, with the highest expression during the light period, consistent with a primary role in detoxifying H 2 O 2 derived from photosynthesis or photorespiration. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">41</ref> Interestingly, CAT3 is also circadian regulated, but in the opposite manner as CAT2. CAT3 between diurnal rhythm of SOS pathway genes and salinity stress tolerance. In Arabidopsis, elimination of SOS1 leads to the changes in expression of genes related to circadian rhythm. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">38</ref> It suggests that though SOS1 does not show any diurnal rhythm but it regulates diurnal rhythm of several other genes. It also indicates toward unknown and unexplored connection between SOS pathway and circadian clock.</p><p>It is also interesting to find out whether the activities of downstream components of SOS2-SOS3 complex oscillates and coincides with diurnally regulated SOS2 and SOS3 transcripts. One of the downstream components, regulated by this complex is CCR1 (cold-circadian rhythm-RNA binding1) which encodes a Gly-rich RNA-binding protein. CCR1 has similar expression RNA extraction and northern blot analysis. Total RNA was extracted from tissue using TRIzol method as per the manufacturer's instructions (T9424; Sigma-Aldrich). Northern blots were prepared using 20 μg total RNA. Appropriate probes [partial for OsSOS1(AK065608) corresponding to its N-terminal part and full length for other genes; OsSOS2 (AK102270); OsSOS3 (AK101368); OsTOC1 (AK111828)] were amplified using the primers listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> and radiolabeled using the DecaLabel™ DNA labeling kit, (K0621; Fermentas). To avoid any error due to unequal loading of RNA samples, same blot was re-probed each time with different gene probes after washing. Northern blots were hybridized at 65°C in 5 × SSC, 5 × Denhardt's reagent, 0.1% SDS and 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA for 16-18 h. Membrane was washed twice in 0.5 × SSC, 0.1% SDS and 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS for 15 min each at 65°C and scanned on phosphorimager using the software Fujifilm Image Reader. The relative transcript abundance was calculated using the Image Gauge (Fuji Photofilm Co. Ltd.).</p></div>
