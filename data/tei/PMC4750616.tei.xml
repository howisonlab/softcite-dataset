			<abstract>
				<p>Objective: Unnecessary exposure of the abdomen, arms or head may lead to a substantial increase of the radiation dose in portable chest X-rays on the neonatal intensive care unit. The objective was to identify potential factors influencing inappropriate exposure of non-thoracic structures in two teaching hospitals. Methods: The study analysed 200 consecutive digital chest radiographs in 20 preterm neonates (mean gestation 25 ± 1 weeks). Demographical data, tube settings and exposure parameters were recorded. To grade the collimation, we used a scoring system with a maximum of 12 exposed non-thoracic structures. Length of gestation, age, the radiographer, years of experience in performing X-rays and the number of in situ catheters or lines, were correlated with collimation quality. Results: There was no significant difference between the rates of optimal images obtained in the two hospitals (0.32 vs 0.39, n.s.). Scores showed that most suboptimal images had only mildly reduced image quality (1.40 ± 1.38 vs 1.20 ± 1.43, n.s.). Length of gestation or presence of surgical drains, catheters and tubes had no obvious effects on the exposure of non-thoracic structures. Large intra-individual variation in optimal collimation (14-86%) was noted for the radiographers in both hospitals; this was unrelated to their respective years of experience. Conclusion: In our study, the only identifiable factor influencing the collimation of portable chest radiographs in preterm infants was the radiographer&apos;s dedication and awareness. There were no apparent differences between the hospitals investigated. Exposure of non-thoracic structures was relatively frequent and mainly involved the proximal humeri.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Materials and methods</head><p>The study consisted of a retrospective analysis of 200 mobile digital AP chest X-rays (stored on phosphor plates) carried out on 20 preterm neonates at two different hospitals, including patients with multiple X-rays (performed on separate occasions). One hundred images were acquired from a university hospital (site 1) and another 100 images were obtain from a community teaching hospital (site 2). We extracted demographical data from the case notes, including the length of gestation (weeks) and the age of the neonate on the date of the X-ray. Tube settings and exposure parameters, including tube voltage, tube current and dose-area product (DAP) were recorded. The radiography systems used were a Philips Mobile Diagnost (Philips Healthcare, The Netherlands) at site 1, and a Siemens Mobilette (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) at site 2. The radiographers were noted, as well as their years of experience in performing X-rays. In addition, we recorded the presence of tubes and catheters as a surrogate of disease severity. The data were anonymised before image evaluation. Radiographs used for the study were included sequentially and not preselected. We did not take the diagnosis into account. Both hospitals monitored the rate of repeat X-rays. Repeat images on neonates were not allowed without the permission of a consultant radiologist. All procedures performed in studies involving human participants were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and/or national research committee and with the 1964 Helsinki declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards. For this type of study formal consent was not required. Informed consent was obtained from all individual participants included in the study.</p><p>Two experienced radiologists (JCS and IK-S) evaluated the image quality, based on the exposure of non-thoracic structures. They determined the most superior and inferior parts of the body, as well as the lateral structures, which had been included within the boundaries of collimation on each chest X-ray. The readers performed their evaluations according to the European Guidelines on Quality Criteria for Diagnostic Radiographic Images in Paediatrics <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. A grading system was used to measure image quality in terms of correct collimation. Inappropriate exposure of abdominal viscera was assumed when the caudal imaging field extended below the level of L1/2 (1 point). Exposure of the cranial structures was considered inappropriate when the collimated field included more than the tip of the mandible (1 point). Inappropriate exposure of the arms was assumed when more than the diametaphyseal junction of the proximal humerus came within the field of view: part of the diaphyseal humerus (1 point); entire humerus (2 points); part of the forearm (1 point); entire forearm (2 points); hand (1 point). The maximum score was 12 points. The image quality in terms of correct collimation was graded arbitrarily as follows: 0 points = optimal image quality; 1-2 points = slightly reduced; 3-4 = moderately reduced; 5-6 = markedly reduced; and &gt;7 points = severely reduced ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>). Rotation and tilting were also recorded. Radiographic errors were recorded on individual tick sheets and the information was captured in an Excel spreadsheet (Microsoft, Redmond, WA). The readers resolved any differences by consensus.</p><p>The exposure of non-thoracic structures was correlated with factors potentially influencing image quality.

Student's t test was used to calculate differences between DAPs. The Spearman rank correlation coefficient was used to analyse the correlation between the radiographer's experience in performing X-rays and collimation quality. A level of p &lt; 0.05 was regarded as statistically significant. Analyses were performed using SAS statistical software (version 9.1; SAS Institute, Cary, NC).</p></div>

Imaging parameters were 60 (60-62) kVp and 1.96 (1.6-2.5) mAs at the university hospital, and 72 (70-77) kVp and 0.71 (0.56-0.80) mAs at the community hospital, with no grid and a 20 × 25 cm image plate. The DAPs were 0.08 ± 0.04 cGy cm 2 and 0.10 ± 0.05 cGy cm 2 , respectively (n.s.). The monitored repeat rates were low at both units. Only one repeat X-ray was recorded at site 2 and none at site 1. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> shows all exposed non-thoracic structures in both hospitals.

However, a large variation in the collimation could be seen when looking at the points scored by different radiographers. The rates of optimal images varied between 14% and 86%. The range of mean scores for each radiographer was 0.44-2.50 at site 1 and 0.14-2.50 at site 2.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p>Numerous reports have suggested that infants and young children are more sensitive to radiation exposure than older children and adults, so there is a greater potential for harmful side effects. Although radiographic imaging results in a relatively small dose compared with computed tomography, the vast number of X-rays taken represents an increased risk to the population as a whole <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</p><p>In general, there are two major issues in radiography quality assurance: one that addresses the quality of the diagnostic X-ray equipment and the other that reviews the quality of the radiographs performed <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>. Numerous technical strategies to reduce patient dose have been discussed in the literature. The effects of parameter settings, shielding, incorrect positioning, grid use, and exposure indicator targets have been extensively investigated <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>.</p><p>However, independently of technical parameter settings, correct collimation is an important practical issue in radiography. Collimation reduces the volume of tissue irradiated and decreases patient exposure. It also reduces the amount of scatter radiation produced (although the effect in neonates is relatively small compared to adults). However, reduction of scatter radiation reaching the image receptor increases image contrast and quality. Including extra-thoracic structures in the field does not usually provide any useful information on a chest X-ray but may result in a substantial increase in radiation exposure.</p><p>We compared the frequency of optimal imaging in two different hospitals and investigated potential factors influencing collimation. Our results indicate that the exposure of non-thoracic structures is a relatively frequent phenomenon. Complete or partial exposure of the upper arm was the most common finding. In the majority of cases, however, image quality in terms of collimation was only mildly reduced. The rates of optimal images were similar at the two hospitals, one of which has a dedicated paediatric imaging service (site 1).</p><p>Recent reports found clear differences between paediatric and mixed-patient radiography services (as at site 2), with respect to image acquisition, image-quality assessment, and general emphasis on radiation dose reduction <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. In a survey of 493 radiographers, Morrison et al. found that patient motion is by far the most common reason for repeat exposures in all services. Other causes such as poor positioning, anatomical clipping, artefacts, and underexposure were much more commonly described in radiography services not based in children's hospitals. They concluded that the risk of patient movement encourages many technologists to widen their collimation with infants and children, in order to capture all the necessary anatomy. The ease of repeating examinations immediately with direct radiography may also contribute to an increased tendency to repeat less-than-perfect exposures <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. However, compared with infants in general, motion was certainly a less important issue in the neonates investigated in our study and the repeat rates monitored were comparably low at the two institutions.</p><p>The gestation age (as a surrogate of weight and size) and the number of external lines or catheters (as a surrogate of disease severity) did not have any obvious effects on collimation. We found, somewhat unexpectedly, that the number of optimal images for each individual radiographer differed considerably. This phenomenon was not, however, significantly correlated to the years of experience in performing X-rays. Other intrinsic factors, such as educational level and awareness of the radiographer, may be responsible for the large variation observed. However, while these factors are difficult to measure on an objective basis, our results support the idea of individualised training for radiographers, to improve image quality and decrease radiation doses in paediatric radiography.</p><p>Morrisson et al. emphasised the need for better educational materials and training programmes for radiographers. They claim that broad commitment is required from manufacturers, educational institutions, speciality paediatric radiology organisations and individual imaging specialists <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. In the study on the education of technologists, participants stressed the importance of immediate feedback on image quality and exposure, information about appropriate technical settings for paediatric patients, and more reliable measures of radiation exposure for patients in general.</p><p>In a recent report, Hlabangana and Andronikou investigated the impact of short lectures for radiographers in conjunction with poster material showing technical errors in the image quality of paediatric chest X-rays. They observed a statistically significant improvement in the quality of radiographs performed immediately after the educational intervention and a statistically significant subsequent decline in the quality of radiographs performed &gt;2 months afterwards <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. The rate of poorly collimated images (5.4%) was lower than we found in our study. However, their evaluation did not include any portable X-rays in neonates. They concluded that continuing education is needed on a regular basis (e.g. every 2 months). To the best of our knowledge, no information is available regarding image quality for individual radiographers or individual responses to an educational intervention.</p><p>Compared with the amount of literature addressing imaging parameters and other technical aspects in radiography, relatively few data are available on the individual (human) factors influencing radiation exposure in paediatric imaging. In view of the very large differences at baseline, we can conclude from our data that individualised quality assurance, training and follow-up are necessary. Given the different distribution of red bone marrow in children (contained in a relatively small imaging field), every centimetre of incorrect collimation accounts for a substantial increase in the radiation burden, whereas the effect on overall exposure in the adult is relatively small <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Limitations</head><p>Our study is limited by its retrospective design, relatively small number of patients, and the lack of a control group. Despite these limitations, our results show that the individual education of radiographers remains an important factor in paediatric radiation protection. The radiographer represents the last line of defence against the unnecessary irradiation of pre-term infants.</p></div>
