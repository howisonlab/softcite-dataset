				<p>We investigate the asymptotic and finite sample properties of the most widely used information criteria for co-integration rank determination in &apos;partial&apos; systems, i.e. in co-integrated vector autoregressive (VAR) models where a subset of variables of interest is modelled conditional on another subset of variables. The asymptotic properties of the Akaike information criterion (AIC), the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) and the Hannan-Quinn information criterion (HQC) are established, and consistency of BIC and HQC is proved. Notably, the consistency of BIC and HQC is robust to violations of weak exogeneity of the conditioning variables with respect to the co-integration parameters. More precisely, BIC and HQC recover the true co-integration rank from the partial system analysis also when the conditional model does not convey all information about the co-integration parameters. This result opens up interesting possibilities for practitioners who can now determine the co-integration rank in partial systems without being concerned about the weak exogeneity of the conditioning variables. A Monte Carlo experiment based on a large dimensional data generating process shows that BIC and HQC applied in partial systems perform reasonably well in small samples and comparatively better than &apos;traditional&apos;methods for co-integration rank determination. We further show the usefulness of our approach and the benefits of the conditional system analysis in two empirical illustrations, both based on the estimation of VAR systems on US quarterly data. Overall, our analysis shows the gains of combining information criteria with partial system analysis.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. Introduction</head><p>Co-integration rank determination in vector autoregressive (VAR) systems where some variables of interest, Y t , are modelled conditional on some other variables, Z t , has been addressed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Harbo et al. (1998)</ref>  <ref type="bibr">[HJNR hereafter]</ref>, see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Johansen (1992a</ref><ref type="bibr">Johansen ( , b, 1996</ref>. The idea of the conditional analysis is that the dimensionality of the system is reduced, and, when conditioning is valid, co-integration tests may have better power properties. The 'partial system' approach proves to be useful in situations where (i) the dimension of the whole VAR system p := dim(X t ), X t := (Y t , Z t ), is large relative to the sample size T ; (ii) the practitioner is essentially interested in modelling Y t and it is known that Z t contributes to the long-run equilibrium of the system but either the theory is silent about the short run properties of Z t , or the scope of the analysis does not require modelling Z t explicitly; (iii) the time series used for Z t are considered poor proxies of the corresponding theoretical variables they should measure, especially as concerns their transitory dynamics.</p><p>In general, the parameters of the (conditional) model for Y t given Z t (Y t | Z t ) and of the marginal model for Z t are interrelated, which means that a full system analysis is needed to draw efficient inference about the parameters of the two models. The special case where the partial (conditional) model for Y t given Z t contains as much information about the parameters of interest as the full system is when Z t is weakly exogenous, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Engle, Hendry and Richard (1983)</ref>. Under the weak exogeneity of Z t for the co-integrating parameters, HJNR derive the asymptotic distribution of the likelihood ratio test for cointegrating rank in the partial model, and provide tables of critical values. When Z t is not weakly exogenous for the co-integrating parameters, the conditional model for Y t given Z t conveys only partial information about the long-run structure of the system.</p><p>Actually, the requirement of weak exogeneity of Z t can nullify the benefits of the partial system analysis as suggested in HJNR and limit its usefulness in applied work. On the one hand, when weak exogeneity of Z t fails, the practitioner cannot apply the asymptotic critical values tabulated in HJNR and must resort to the full system analysis. On the other hand, it is difficult to check the hypothesis of weak exogeneity of Z t efficiently without a full system analysis or disregarding the model for Z t . <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Urbain (1992)</ref> shows that 'traditional' orthogonality tests <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Pesaran and Smith, 1990)</ref> are not sufficient to address the issue of weak exogeneity in error-correction models, see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Boswijk and Urbain (1997)</ref>. It is not surprising, therefore, that despite conditional (structural) error-correction models have been widely applied in applied work, only seldom the partial system approach has been used for inference on the co-integration rank, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Doornik, Hendry and Nielsen (1998)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bårdsen and Fisher (1999)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Bruggeman, Donati and Warne (2003)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Johansen (1992b)</ref> for an early example. In empirical studies where a (structural) conditional system for Y t given Z t is used, the co-integration rank is typically either assumed to be known, or is assumed to be inferred from a full system analysis in a previous stage, see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Boswijk (1995)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Ericsson (1995)</ref>.</p><p>Information-based methods are a well-established alternative to approaches based on (sequential) Neyman-Pearson type tests for co-integration rank determination. In particular, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Aznar and Salvador (2002)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Cavaliere et al. (2015)</ref>  <ref type="bibr">[CDRT hereafter]</ref>, among others, show that standard information criteria such as the familiar Bayesian information criterion (BIC) and Hannan-Quinn information criterion (HQC) provide powerful alterna-tives to the traditional Johansen's co-integration rank tests, as they are weakly consistent estimators of the co-integration rank. Conversely, the Akaike information criterion (AIC) does not deliver a consistent estimate of the co-integration rank as its penalty does not satisfy the required rate condition (formally defined in section III below). Therefore, it is an asymptotically upward biased estimator of the co-integration rank.</p><p>In this paper, we put forth an information criteria-based approach for co-integration rank determination in the partial (conditional) model for Y t given Z t , which does not require the hypothesis of weak exogeneity of Z t with respect to the co-integration parameters. Our main result is that the use of either BIC or HQC in partial systems yields weakly consistent estimates of the true co-integration rank (the same result does not apply to the AIC). Compared to HJNR, the suggested approach does not require the use of tables of critical values: the selected co-integration rank is the one which minimizes BIC or HQC across rank r = 0, 1,…, p Y , where p Y := dim(Y t ). Notably, we prove the consistency of BIC and HQC irrespective of whether Z t is weakly exogeneous or not. The main implication of this result is that the practitioner can in fact disregard the marginal model for Z t without pretesting or being concerned with the weak exogeneity of Z t . BIC and HQC select asymptotically the 'true' co-integration rank from the conditional model of Y t given Z t , and perform reasonably well in finite samples. Thus, our approach to co-integration rank determination fully restores the main benefits of the partial system analysis.</p><p>We document the advantages of our approach in finite samples by a set of Monte Carlo experiments. We investigate co-integration rank determination by information criteria in the partial system approach and compare results with those obtained with the full system approach. We consider two scenarios: one where the conditioning variables Z t are weakly exogenous with respect to the co-integration parameters, and the other where the weak exogeneity constraint does not hold. We show that, under weak exogeneity, BIC tends to outperform 'traditional' co-integration rank tests in both full and conditional systems. The selection frequency of the null hypothesis of co-integration rank equal to the true co-integration rank delivered by HJRN's sequential test is remarkably inferior to the corresponding selection frequencies provided by BIC when Z t is weakly exogenous for the co-integration parameters. Conversely, when the hypothesis of weak exogeneity is not valid, BIC tends to underestimate the true co-integration rank in small sample sizes. Instead, HQC in partial systems outperforms its analogue in full systems, irrespective of Z t being weakly exogenous or not. That is, its selection frequencies are roughly the same in the two cases and the finite sample performance tends to be better than <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Johansen's (1996)</ref> sequential procedure in the full (unconditional) VAR system. Quite surprisingly, the results from the Monte Carlo experiments also show that the violation of the hypothesis of weak exogeneity has only a limited impact on the finite sample performance of HJNR's sequential test, although the associated critical values are tabulated under the maintained hypothesis of exogeneity. In particular, when the conditioning variables are not weakly exogenous for the co-integration parameters, HQC and HJNR's sequential procedure perform in partial systems and in samples of lengths typically available to practitioners no worse than their full system analogues. Thus, despite ignoring the marginal model for Z t may imply a loss of information on the adjustment mechanisms at work in the whole system, the benefits of reduced dimensionality tends to compensate possible power losses when HQC is used. Interestingly, our Monte Carlo experiments also suggest that the finite sample performance of HQC and BIC (as well as HJNR's sequential procedure) is still satisfactory when VAR disturbances are driven by GARCH-type components. This robustness finding lines up with what <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Cavaliere, Rahbek and Taylor (2010)</ref> and CDRT have shown to be the case in full system analyses.</p><p>We also provide two empirical illustrations. In the first example, we emphasize the benefits of combining information criteria and the partial system approach by focusing on a relatively large system including seven (p = 7) US macroeconomic variables observed at quarterly frequency on the period 1984-2008. We show that co-integration rank determination from the conditional model for Y t given Z t delivers, for suitable choices of Z t , reliable results relative to the full system analysis. In the second example, we consider the co-integration/common-trend implications of a version of the small-scale dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) monetary model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Benati and Surico (2009)</ref>. We show that in this case, even if the dimension of X t is not large relative to the sample size, it may be convenient to marginalize Z t out of the analysis. Our empirical results confirm that co-integration rank determination by information criteria, especially by the HQC, delivers reasonable and reliable results.</p><p>The paper is organized as follows. Section II describes the reference co-integrated VAR model. In section III, we outline the information criteria for co-integration rank determination in partial systems and we establish their asymptotic properties. The results from our Monte Carlo simulations are reported in section IV, while section V shows the usefulness of the suggested approach for the two empirical illustrations mentioned above. Section VI contains some concluding remarks. The proof of our main result, Theorem 1, is given in the accompanying online appendix.</p></div>

A conditional co-integrated VAR model</head><p>Consider the p-dimensional process {X t } (the full system) which satisfies the k-th order reduced rank VAR model:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">X t = X t−1 + k−1 i=1 i X t−i + D t + d t + " t , t = 1,…, T<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where X t := (X 1t ,…, X pt ) and the initial values, X 1−k ,…, X 0 , are fixed in the statistical analysis.

In this case, the asymptotic distribution of HJNR's testing procedure for co-integration rank is free of nuisance parameters. Asymptotic critical values have been tabulated under such conditions in HJNR. This is no longer the case if the assumption of weak exogeneity, Z = 0, does not hold. More precisely, when Z = 0, the conditional model does not convey all the information on the co-integration relations and maximum likelihood inference on based on system (2) is neither fully efficient nor of standard type. However, we will show below that when 0 r 0 p Y , it is possible to consistently recover the co-integration rank also with Z = 0 by using information criteria.</p><p>Next, we discuss an information criteria-based approach to consistent co-integration rank determination that does not require the investigator to take any stand on the weak exogeneity condition of Z t with respect to .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. Information criteria for co-integration rank determination in partial systems</head><p>We now focus on the conditional partial model (2) and the implied eigenvalue problem discussed in the previous section. Let IC(r) := −2`T (r) + p T denote an information criterion, where p T := c T (r) is a penalty function that depends upon the number of parameters (r) and on a term c T , to be specified below. We have that</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">IC(r) := T log |ˆ c,r | + c T (r) = T log |S 00 | + T r i=1 log(1 −ˆ i ) + c T (r)<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where the eigenvaluesˆ i , i = 1,…, r, are determined from equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">4</ref> In particular, as is well-known, c T = 2, log T , and 2 log log T yields the AIC, BIC, and HQC, respectively. The co-integration rank estimator is then given, in generic form, bŷ</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">r := arg min r=0,1,…,p Y IC(r).<label>(6)</label></formula><p>Importantly, the determination of the co-integration rank based on the estimator in equation (6) exempts practitioners from the use of tables of asymptotic critical values which are instead required when sequential testing procedures as in HJNR are applied. In the following theorem, we state our main result about the consistency of the information criteria. The key requirement is that the penalty term c T diverges at a rate lower than T , as T → ∞. Theorem 1. Let {X t } be generated as in equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>with the true parameters satisfying the I(1,r 0 ) conditions. (a) If r 0 p Y , it holds that, as T → ∞:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">(a.i) for r 0 &lt; r p Y , P(IC(r) &gt; IC(r 0 )) → 1, provided c T → + ∞; (a.ii) for 0 r &lt; r 0 , P(IC(r) &gt; IC(r 0 )) → 1, provided c T /T →0. (b) If r 0 &gt; p Y , for all r &lt; p Y , as T → ∞, it holds that P(IC(r) &gt; IC(p Y )) → 1, provided c T /T →0.</formula><p>Remark 1. The results in case (a) of Theorem 1 imply that, when r 0 p Y , either BIC or HQC penalties in the partial system (2) will yield a weakly consistent estimate of r 0 . The AIC will not deliver a consistent estimate of the co-integration rank as its penalty does not satisfy condition (a.i) in Theorem 1. Therefore, this criterion will not be considered further.</p><p>Remark 2. When r 0 &gt; p Y (case (b) of Theorem 1), i.e. the dimension of the conditional system is lower than the true number of co-integration relations in the full system (1), only certain linear combinations of the co-integrating vectors can be estimated on the basis of the partial model in equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">2</ref>. In such cases, the co-integration rank estimator in equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_7">6</ref>will tend to select the maximum possible rank,r = p Y . Therefore, the results in Theorem 1 imply that, in general,r will converge to min(r 0 , p Y ). Hence, in the limit</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">r = p Y whenever r 0 p Y .</formula><p>Remark 3. Importantly, inTheorem 1 the determination of the co-integration rank based on the estimator in equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_7">6</ref>does not require Z to be zero in equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">3</ref>. That is, our approach can be also applied when the variables in Z t adjust to X t−1 , which is a concrete possibility in applied work. The practitioner can determine the co-integration rank without being concerned about the possible adjustment of Z t to X t−1 . The robustness of BIC and HQC to possible violations of weak exogeneity of the conditioning variables allows one to fully benefit from reductions of the dimensionality of the system. When r 0 p Y (case (a) of Theorem 1), the intuition at the basis of this result is that the asymptotic behaviour of the eigenvalues from the determinantal problem (4) is such that, for 0 r p Y , the condition IC(r) &gt; IC(r 0 ) holds, under the conditions (a.i) and (a.ii) of Theorem 1, irrespective of Z t being weakly exogenous for or not. More precisely, as formally shown in the proof of Theorem 1 (see the accompanying online appendix), when r &gt; r 0 , information criteria rely on a consistent estimator of the error variance matrix c,r 0 because the eigenvalueŝ</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">r 0 +1 ,…,ˆ r of the determinantal problem (4) are O p (T −1 )</formula><p>. This is valid regardless of the weak exogeneity condition. In this case, the difference IC(r) − IC(r 0 ) involves the term T r i=r 0 +1 log(1 −ˆ i ) which is O p (1), plus a term which diverges under the condition (a.i) of Theorem 1, leading to IC(r 0 ) &lt; IC(r). Instead, when r &lt; r 0 p Y , albeit when the weak exogeneity condition fails nuisance parameters are involved in the limit distribution of the eigenvalues of the determinantal problem (4), there are still r 0 − r positive solutions. In this case, the difference IC(r) − IC(r 0 ) involves the term −T r 0 i=r+1 log(1 −ˆ i ) which is O p (T ), plus a term which converges to zero under the condition (a.ii) of Theorem 1, leading again to IC(r 0 ) &lt; IC(r). When r 0 &gt; p Y (case (b) of Theorem 1), the argument is similar. Finally, notice that since we do not have any particular restriction on the conditioning variables, Z t could also contain co-integrated variables.</p><p>Remark 4. Theorem 1 assumes that the system lag length k in equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>is known. This assumption, which is often unreasonable in practice, can be relaxed and information criteria can be used to determine both the autoregressive lag length and the co-integration rank following either a jointly or a sequential procedure (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Cavaliere et al., 2016)</ref>. Moreover, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Aznar and Salvador (2002)</ref> provide an approach based on information criteria to also determine the form of the deterministic component. While we do not consider the determination of the system lag order and the choice of the form of the deterministic component in this paper, the strategies outlined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Cavaliere et al. (2016)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Aznar and Salvador (2002)</ref>, respectively, can also be extended to the present framework.</p><p>Remark 5.

Specifically, when T = 100, BIC correctly estimates r = r 0 96.8%, 95.6% and 94.8% of the time for p Y = 2, 3 and 4 (p Z = 5, 4 and 3), respectively, while the percentages for T = 200 and T = 1000 are substantially constant over the different dimensions of the conditioning set. Conversely, HQC appears to be more affected than BIC by the dimension of the conditioning set when the sample size is relatively small, namely when T = 100 and T = 200: the larger the dimension of Z t , p Z , the better its finite sample performance. HJNR's sequential test performs similarly to HQC in partial systems. For instance, when T = 200, HJNR's sequential test correctly estimates the 'true' co-integration rank 88.9%, 84.2% and 82.4% of the time, against 89.7%, 82.7% and 81% of the time for HQC, when p Y = 2, 3 and 4, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Scenario B: no weak exogeneity</head><p>In this scenario, we evaluate the impact of the lack of weak exogeneity of the conditioning variables on the performance of the methods for co-integration rank determination in partial systems. Since such an hypothesis is difficult to test in practice, it is interesting to quantify possible drawbacks associated with a partial system analysis, when the conditioning variables Z t are not weakly exogenous. <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2</ref> reports, for the case of no weak exogeneity (c = 3 4 in of equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_11">7</ref>), the estimated selection probabilities, i.e. the percentage of times BIC and HQC select r = 0,…, p Y , respectively, for p Y = 2, 3 and 4. Also in this case, we sketch the estimated selection probabilities associated with HJNR's sequential test and, as in the previous scenario, we also consider co-integration rank determination using the (unconditional) full system (right-panel of <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2)</ref>.</p><p>Although it clearly outperforms both HQC and Johansen's sequential procedure in the full system analysis (see the results in the right-panel of Table 2), the results in the leftpanels of <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2</ref> show that, when weak exogeneity does not hold, the performance of BIC deteriorates considerably when the sample size is relatively small, as it tends to underestimate the true co-integration rank. In particular, when T = 100 (T = 200) the selection frequency of the 'true' rank for BIC drops to 41.4%, 33.4% and 27.7% (80.1%, 71.1% and 63.2%) for p Y = 2, 3 and 4, respectively. As predicted by the results in Theorem 1, this effect tends to disappear as T increases: similarly to the case of weak exogeneity in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>, when T = 1, 000 BIC always selects r = r 0 = 1, even when the weak exogeneity hypothesis is not valid. Conversely, the HQC performs similarly to the case of weak exogeneity and still outperforms its counterpart in the (unconditional) full system (right-panel of <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table  2</ref>). In particular, HQC selects r = r 0 = 1 only 49.7% (82.8%) of the time in the full system when T = 100 (T = 200), while these frequencies are 69.5%, 57.2% and 52.5% (89.6%, 84% and 83%) in partial systems for p Y = 2, 3 and 4, respectively. Moreover, these results are very close to (and, in some cases, even outperform) the corresponding results under weak exogeneity (cf. <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>). These results highlight that the HQC is not severely affected by the violation of the weak exogeneity hypothesis of the conditioning set. Quite surprisingly, also the performance of the HJNR's sequential test does not appear to be strongly affected by the lack of weak exogeneity of Z t as we would expect, given that the critical values reported in table 5 of HJNR are tabulated under the weak exogeneity assumption. Moreover, HJNR's sequential test displays a less marked tendency to overestimate the 'true' co-integration rank than Johansen's sequential procedure in the (unconditional) full system, thus leading to a better overall performance also in the case of no weak exogeneity. In particular, Johansen's sequential test selects r = r 0 = 1 only 45.5% (74%) of the time when T = 100 (T = 200), while the corresponding selection frequencies in partial systems for HJNR's sequential test are 69.3%, 62.1% and 57.9% (88.4%, 85.4% and 81.8%) in the case  of p Y = 2, 3 and 4, respectively. Furthermore, as in the case of weak exogeneity <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">(Table 1)</ref>, the empirical performance of HJNR's sequential test and HQC in partial systems are similar. As such, these two methods usefully complement each other in practice and are rather robust to violations of the hypothesis of weak exogeneity. <ref type="bibr">9</ref> We consider a further case which, in addition to the violation of the weak exogeneity hypothesis, allows Z t to contain co-integrated variables. In particular, we add a further co-integration relation in model (7), ceteris paribus, by specifying := a 0 0 0 c c/2 c/ 3 −a/ 2 0 0 0 −0.5 −0.3 0.25 and := 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 −1 , <ref type="bibr">9</ref> It is also interesting to stress that the finite sample behaviour of BIC is the one which is more sensitive to the extent of the violation from weak exogeneity: The larger the value of c in in equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_11">7</ref>, the worse its performance for small T . However, as expected from a theoretical viewpoint and in line with the results in where, as in the previous case of Scenario B, we set a = −0.4 and c = 3 4 . In this case, we have that the last two variables in X t (and in Z t ) co-integrate among themselves, so that the true co-integration rank is r 0 = 2. The selection frequencies of r = 0,…, p Y for BIC, HQC and HJNR's sequential procedure in partial systems of dimension p Y = 2, 3 and 4 are reported in the left-panels of <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 3</ref>, whereas the results obtained from the (unconditional) full VAR analysis are reported in the right-panel of <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 3</ref>. Results in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 3</ref> show that, also in the case when Z t contains co-integrated variables, HQC and HJNR's sequential procedure provide satisfactory results in partial systems, especially when p Z is large, outperforming their analogues in the (unconditional) full system, even when the sample size is small. Conversely, when T = 100 and 200, BIC tends to underestimate the true co-integration rank and its performance in partial systems is worse than that obtained from the full system analysis.</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">= - - - - - - 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.0 0.1 0.7 r = - - - - - - - - - 0.0 0.0 0.1 r = - - - - - - - - - 0.0 0.0 0.0 r = - - - - - - - - - 0.0 0.0 0.0 T =</formula><p>Therefore, the story we learn from <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2</ref> and <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 3</ref> is that when the conditioning variables are not weakly exogenous for the co-integration parameters and in samples of lengths typically available to practitioners, HQC and HJNR's sequential procedures (but not BIC) perform in partial systems no worse than their analogues perform in full systems. Thus, despite ignoring the marginal model for Z t may imply a loss of information on the adjustment mechanisms at work in the whole system, with HQC the reduction of dimensionality tends to fully compensate the possible loss of power in co-integration rank determination from the conditional system.</p><p>As we noticed in section II, co-integration rank determination in partial systems can potentially be extended to the case of conditional heteroscedasticity along the lines of <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Cavaliere et al. (2010)</ref> and CDRT. 10 When the actual unconditional probability distribution of " t in system (1) is non-Gaussian, it is still in principle possible to factorize the density of X t as the product of the conditional density for Y t given Z t and the marginal density for Z t . However, the dynamic structure of the conditional system might not necessarily conform to that in equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">2</ref>and the parametric restrictions under which Z t is weakly exogenous for might become more involved. It turns out that checking the robustness of the HQC and BIC to conditional heteroscedasticity in partial systems is crucial for applied work. We perform such robustness check by considering the same DGP as in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2</ref> but specifying the innovation process " t in equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_11">7</ref>as a CCC-GARCH <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bollerslev, 1990)</ref> process, i.e., <ref type="bibr">10</ref> Cavaliere et al. <ref type="bibr">(2010)</ref> show that the extension to conditional heteroscedasticity is allowed as long as that the innovations {" t } in equation (1) (i) form a martingale difference sequence with respect to the filtration F t := (X t ,…, X t−1 ), where F t−1 ⊆ F t for t =…, − 1, 0, 1, 2,…, (ii) satisfy the condition E " t 4 K &lt; ∞, • being the Euclidean norm, and (iii) fulfil the global homoscedasticity condition:   where H t = E(" t " t |F t−1 ) is the conditional variance of " t , F t := (X t ,…, X t−1 ) is the filtration at time t and R is a symmetric positive definite matrix containing the constant conditional correlations ij . 11 Results are reported in <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table 4</ref>. By comparing selection frequencies in <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table 4</ref> with those in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2</ref>, we observe that the CCC-GARCH(1,1) disturbances have only a limited impact on the finite sample ability of information criteria (as well as HJNR's sequential procedure) to correctly select co-integration rank.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. Empirical illustrations</head><p>Despite conditional (possibly uni-equational) error-correction models have been used extensively in the literature (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Urbain, 1992)</ref>, only seldom the partial system approach to co-integration rank determination has been applied in empirical works. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Doornik et al. (1998)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bårdsen, Jansen and Nymoen (2003)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Bruggeman et al. (2003)</ref> are some of the few examples where HJNR's testing procedure is implemented. As already observed, two main difficulties characterize the use of HJNR's sequential test in applied work. First, it is generally difficult to select a priori the vector Z t of weakly exogenous conditioning variables. Second, testing weak exogeneity of Z t efficiently requires either a full-system approach or the analysis of the marginal model for Z t , see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Urbain (1992)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Boswijk (1995)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Ericsson (1995)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Boswijk and Urbain (1997)</ref>. In both cases the benefits of the partial system analysis are nullified. In the previous sections, we have shown that we can use BIC and/or HQC to determine co-integration rank in the conditional model Y t given Z t in equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">2</ref>, without being concerned about the weak exogeneity of Z t . Moreover, the Monte Carlo results show that the finite sample performance of BIC and HQC in the conditional model Y t given Z t is generally not worse than the empirical performance of the BIC and HQC in the full system for X t := (Y t , Z t ) regardless of whether VAR disturbances are Gaussian or driven by GARCH-type components. In this section, we illustrate the advantages of our approach by two empirical examples, both based on the estimation of VAR models on US quarterly data.</p><p>In the first empirical example (section 'Large-dimensional VAR'), we consider a relatively large-scale VAR system estimated on quarterly data relative to the 'Great Moderation' period, 1984Q1-2008Q2. The idea in this case is to show that, other than reducing the dimensionality of the system, the partial system approach combined with the use of information criteria can be useful for co-integration rank determination. In particular, it is argued that in the absence of clear theoretical guidances about the number of stochastic trends in X t := (Y t , Z t ), one useful empirical specification strategy is to start the analysis by including in Z t time series that are not supposed to co-integrate. Indeed, although Z t can be co-integrated in our approach (see Remark 3 and the Monte Carlo results in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 3</ref>), in large systems it can be relatively easier to make conjectures on which time series should not co-integrate rather than on the variables which should be weakly exogenous. Given different choices of the candidate Z t vector, the empirical illustration shows that our empirical specification strategy, combined with BIC and HQC, simplifies co-integration rank determination.</p><p>In the second empirical example (section 'Small-scale DSGE model'), we investigate the co-integration/common-trend implications of a small-scale DSGE model for the US business cycle. We show that our approach can be advantageous compared to the full system analysis when the researcher does not want to take any explicit modelling stand on one of the time series that contributes to the system's long-run equilibrium. More specifically, the DSGE model we consider features the natural rate of output, which is a variable that captures a highly theoretical concept, difficult to characterize in applied work. We show that it is convenient to treat (proxy of the) natural rate of output as a conditioning variable, disregarding whether it is weakly exogeneous or not.</p></div>

In line with this literature, we identify the beginning and the end of the 'Great Moderation' sample with the dates 1984Q1 and 2008Q2, respectively, for a total of T + k = 98 quarterly observations, where k is the VAR lag order for X t := (cnd t , cd t , i t , y t , inf t , f t , R t ) . The end of the sample, 2008Q2, is justified by our decision to avoid dealing with the acceleration of the financial crisis and, above all, with the binding zero-lower bound (ZLB) that has kicked in since the end of 2008. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 1</ref> plots the 'great ratios' cnd t − y t , cd t − y t and i t − y t , the (ex post) real interest rate, R t − inf t , the interest rate differential, R t − f t , and the (ex post) real version of the policy rate, f t − inf t , on the period 1984Q1-2008Q2. According to neoclassical theory, under balanced growth there should be a common stochastic trend driving cnd t , cd t , i t and y t , and the 'great ratios'cnd t − y t , cd t − y t and i t − y t should be stationary <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(King et al., 1991)</ref>. Also the interest rates R t , f t and the inflation rate inf t should be driven by a single (common) stochastic trend while the (ex post) real interest rates and the interest rate differential should be stationary. The simple graphical inspection of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 1</ref> suggests, however, that aside  </p><formula xml:id="formula_23">:= (cnd t , i t , inf t ) ( p Z = 3) Partial: Z t := (i t , inf t ) ( p Z = 2) Full: p Y = p = 7 ( p Z = 0) HJNR (5% c.v</formula><formula xml:id="formula_24">:= (cnd t , cd t , i t , y t , inf t , f t , R t ) (p = 7)</formula><p>.

The selected co-integration rank according to the test/criterion used are denoted in bold. not). The results in the middle panel of <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">Table 5</ref> show that we select co-integration ranks of 3 (HJNR), 1 (BIC) and 3 (HQC), respectively. Therefore, we observe a systematic reduction of the co-integration rank compared to the (unconditional) full system analysis.</p><p>We repeat the co-integration rank determination analysis by changing the choice of Y t and Z t , in particular using Y t := (cd t , R t , y t , f t ) (p Y = 4) and Z t := (cnd t , i t , inf t ) (p Z = 3). In this case, the partial system for Y t given Z t in equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">2</ref>is four-dimensional. Results are summarized in the left-panel of <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table 4</ref>. We select co-integration rank 2 (HJNR), 1 (BIC) and 3 (HQC), respectively.</p><p>Overall, the partial system approach combined with the use of BIC and HQC suggests that the selected co-integration rank does not exceed the rank a practitioner would select by using the full system. The inference we have obtained with the conditional model seems in line with the idea that there should be no more than three co-integration relationships in X t over the period 1984Q1-2008Q2. More precisely, the application of the HQC on the conditional models Y t given Z t provides clear and robust indications that, as expected, X t is driven by at least four common stochastic trends. It is worth stressing that this conclusion is obtained without any assumption about the weak exogeneity of the conditioning variables included in Z t .</p><p>To complete our analysis, we test whether the hypothesis of weak exogeneity of Z t := (i t , inf t ) (p Z = 2) and then of Z t := (cnd t , i t , inf t ) (p Z = 3) is supported by the data when the co-integration rank is fixed at r = 3 as suggested by the partial system approach. To do so, we estimate the full VAR for X t := (cnd t , cd t , i t , y t , inf t , f t , R t ) , fix the co-integration rank to r = 3 and then test the corresponding zero restrictions on the matrix, given . The likelihood-ratio test for the null hypothesis of weak exogeneity of Z t := (i t , inf t ) is 37.4 and implies the rejection of the null at the 5% nominal level. Likewise, the likelihood-ratio test for the null hypothesis of weak exogeneity of Z t := (cnd t , i t , inf t ) equals 55.9 and also leads to reject the null considering the 5% nominal level.</p><p>Finally, we observe that the empirical evidence summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">Table 5</ref> is consistent with the Monte Carlo evidence discussed in section IV. For instance, the results for the full system analysis reported in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2</ref> (Scenario B) suggest that for small values of r 0 relative to p and in samples of length T = 100, HQC and Johansen's test tend to select co-integration rank larger than the true one, while BIC tends to select the true co-integration rank more accurately. On the other hand, HQC and HJNR's procedure improve considerably their selection performance in the partial system approach and become more powerful than BIC, which in turn tends to underestimate the true co-integration rank. Based on these considerations, the conclusion from the partial system approach that the co-integration rank is 3 appears a sensible one.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Small-scale DSGE model</head><p>We consider the small-scale DSGE monetary model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Benati and Surico (2009)</ref>, also estimated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bårdsen and Fanelli (2015)</ref>. The structural model features the following equations:x VAR framework. Indeed (see also the previous example), the natural rate of output is a variable which captures a highly theoretical concept: it refers to the highest level of real output that can be sustained over the long term and there is some disagreement among economists about how to characterize such a concept in applied work. In many empirical business cycle models, x n t is treated as an unobserved (latent) state variable, while in empirical applications, x n t is often proxied with measures of economic activity provided by official institutions or national statistical institutes. Thus, albeit in this example the dimension of X t is not particularly large, x n t represents a 'natural' conditioning variable for the purpose of testing the co-integration implications of the DSGE model. In addition, the practitioner might not be interested in modelling x n t directly within the VAR framework due to poor confidence on the short run properties of the time series used to proxy x n t . Hence, it seems reasonable to investigate whether the data support the co-integration/common trend implications predicted by the DSGE model by considering the partition X t = (Y t , Z t ), with Y t = (x t , t , i t ) (p Y = 3) and Z t = x n t (p Z = 1), and then apply BIC and HQC to the conditional model for Y t given Z t . For comparative purposes, we also compute the sequential cointegration rank testing procedure of HJNR which requires Z t to be weakly exogenous with respect to˜ matrix in equation <ref type="formula">14</ref>, namely that = 0 in equation <ref type="formula">13</ref>. As in the previous example, in order to show the usefulness of the partial system approach relative to the (unconditional) full system analysis, we also determine the co-integration rank of X t through the full VAR system approach.</p><p>The variables in X t = (x t , t , i t , x n t ) are chosen as follows: x t is the (logged) real GDP, t is measured by the quarterly growth rate of the GDP deflator, i t is measured by the effective federal funds rate expressed in quarterly terms (averages of monthly values), x n t is approximated with the official measure provided by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). The data source is the web site of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Also in this case the data cover the 'Great Moderation' period. To compare results with Bårdsen and Fanelli (2015), we focus on the sample 1985Q1-2008Q3 which comprises T = 95 quarterly observations. The partial (conditional) system (2) is estimated with k = 2 lags and a restricted constant (corresponding to case (ii) D t = 1 and d t = 0 in the full system (1)). Results are reported in the left-panel of <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">Table 6</ref>, which summarizes the co-integration rank selected by the BIC and HQC, as well as HJNR's sequential procedure. While BIC selects co-integration rank r = 1, HQC selects r = 3 as predicted by the DSGE model. Instead, HJNR's sequential procedure selects r = 2 at the 5% nominal significance level. Recall, however, that the asymptotic critical values reported in <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">Table 6</ref> have been tabulated under the maintained hypothesis of weak exogeneity of Z t = (x n t ) which might not hold (see below). The right panel of <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">Table 6</ref> summarizes the results obtained from the full VAR system analysis and reports the co-integration rank selected by BIC and HQC and Johansen's sequential procedure. We notice that in this case BIC selects r = 1, HQC selects r = 2 and Johansen's sequential procedure selects r = 1 at the 5% nominal significance level. Aside from BIC and compared to the full system analysis, the co-integration ranks selected by HQC and HJNR's sequential procedure in the conditional model are in line with the prediction of the DSGE model.</p><p>It is interesting in this case to test whether for fixed co-integration rank r = 3, which is the value selected by the HQC in the partial system analysis, the variable Z t = (x n t ) is weakly exogenous with respect to in the full system. This amounts to testing whether the last row Results from the full system analysis of X t := (x t , t , i t , x n t ) (p = 4) and from the partial system analysis of Y t := (x t , t , i t ) and Z t := (x n t ) (p Y = 3 and p Z = 1). The 5% c.v. for HJNR's test are taken from table 3 of <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Harbo et al. (1998)</ref> and the 5% c.v. for Johansen's test ('Johan') are taken from table 15.2 of <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Johansen (1996)</ref> (restricted constant). The selected co-integration rank according to the test/criterion used are denoted in bold. The co-integration rank predicted by the theory under the null of the DSGE model is r = r 0 = 3. of the p × 3 matrix is zero in the full system for a given (exactly) identified specification of the p × 3 matrix . The likelihood-ratio test for the three zero restrictions in the matrix is equal to 35.2 and when compared with asymptotic critical values taken from its null 2 -distribution with 3 degree of freedom leads to a firm rejection of the null hypothesis of weak exogeneity. This evidence suggests that, although our Monte Carlo results show that HJNR's sequential procedure tends to perform reasonably well in small samples also when Z t is not weakly exogenous, it must be interpreted with caution in applied work. Conversely, our approach based on information criteria, allows us to disregard any consideration about the weak exogeneity of Z t and therefore is robust to whether the parameter is = 0 or &lt; 0 in the structural equations of our DSGE model. We complete our investigation of the small scale DSGE model by comparing results with <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bårdsen and Fanelli (2015)</ref>. The analysis in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bårdsen and Fanelli (2015)</ref>, based on a full system approach, suggests that if the co-integration rank is fixed at r = 3, a likelihoodratio test for the restrictions that =˜ as in equation <ref type="formula">14</ref>leads to a p-value of 0.009 when asymptotic critical values are used, and to a p-value of 0.04 when a non-parametric bootstrap version of the likelihood-ratio test is computed along the lines of <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Boswijk et al. (2016)</ref>. Overall, we can interpret these evidences as supportive of the small-DSGE model (9)-(13) on the period 1985Q1-2008Q3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. Concluding remarks</head><p>Information criteria have been recently used as valid alternative to co-integration rank tests in co-integrated VAR systems. There are cases where it is convenient to devote attention to the model that characterizes the dynamics of the variables of interest, conditional on some other variables whose dynamic characterization is not of primary interest. This approach is useful either in large systems or when the practitioner benefits from marginalizing out variables which contribute to the long-run equilibrium but do not play a key role in the rest of the analysis. In this paper we have extended the use of information criteria for cointegration rank determination to the case of partial systems. We have proved consistency of BIC and HQC in partial systems and shown the robustness of these criteria to violations of the weak exogeneity of the conditioning variables for the co-integration parameters. A set of Monte Carlo experiments and two empirical illustrations have shown that these criteria represent valid alternatives to the 'traditional' approaches to co-integration rank determination.</p><p>Since the focus of the paper is on co-integration rank determination in partial (conditional) systems, it can be correctly argued that, once the co-integration rank has been determined from the conditional model by information criteria, the inference on the cointegration parameters (e.g. testing hypotheses on the co-integration parameters) can be more involved relative to the full system analysis if Z t is not weakly exogenous; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Johansen (1992a)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Boswijk (1995)</ref>. In particular, if the conditioning variables are not weakly exogenous for the long-run parameters, the maximum likelihood estimator of the co-integration parameters is still super-consistent (albeit not fully efficient) but its asymptotic distribution is not mixed-Gaussian, making the construction of tests cumbersome; see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Phillips (1991</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Phillips ( , 1994</ref>. In this paper we have shown that the benefits of marginalizing Z t out may compensate, in some specific problems and cases of interest, possible losses of efficiency of estimates and the problem of dealing with non-standard inference. As the examples in the empirical section of this paper show, our approach is particularly convenient when the primary concern of the investigator is co-integration rank determination. Obviously, the decision of whether it is preferable to rely on a full or partial system approach for the problem under investigation depends on the specific purposes of the analysis. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>and (r) := r(p Y + p − r) when no deterministic components are involved, (r) := r(p Y + p − r + 1) in the case of a restricted constant and (r) := r(p Y + p − r + 1) + p Y in the restricted trend case.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>perhaps from cd t − y t , the 'great ratios' do not seem fully consistent with stationary (or trend-stationary) patterns on the period 1984Q1-2008Q2. In particular, the fluctuations of cnd t − y t around a possible linear trend and of i t − y t around a constant level do not line up with the typical persistence of stationary, mean-reverting processes. Moreover, only the interest rate differential, R t − f t , appears to be stationary (although highly persistent) around a constant level, while the (ex post) real interest rates R t − inf t and f t − inf t display some trending behaviour (which can partially be explained in terms of the 'aggressive' monetary policy undertaken by the Fed to fight inflation since the end of the seventies). All this evidence is consistent with the view that it was the change in conduct of monetary policy undertaken by the Fed at the end of the seventies/beginning of the eighties that 'stabilized' the US economy through an aggressive behaviour against inflation. In line with the 'Great Moderation' explanation of the US business cycle <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Clarida, Galì and Gertler, 2000)</ref>, one can hardly claim that there are only two common stochastic trends (i.e. five co-integrating relations) driving the variables in X t . Rather, it would seem reasonable to expect the presence of not more than three co-integrating relationships in the 1984Q1-2008Q2 period, corresponding to the existence of at least four common stochastic trends in X t . Given our purposes, we prefer not to take any stand about the possible additional co-integration relation other than cd t − y t and R t − f t .</p><p>We start our empirical analysis by estimating a VAR for X t := (cnd t , cd t , i t , y t , inf t , f t , R t ) (p = 7) with four lags (k = 4) and a restricted linear trend, which corresponds to the case (iii) D t = t, d t = 1 in system (1). The model with restricted linear trend allows for trendstationary co-integration relationships, which can be an interesting case given the time series patterns observed in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. Notice that the full system analysis is carried out for comparative purposes only, namely to check whether we obtain significant differences in the co-integration rank determination with respect to the partial system approach. The right-panel of <ref type="table">Table 5</ref> reports results from <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Johansen's (1996)</ref> sequential co-integration rank procedure at the 5% nominal (asymptotic) level and using BIC and HQC. We select co-integration ranks of 4 (Johansen's test), 2 (BIC) and 4 (HQC), respectively.</p><p>Given the relatively large dimension of X t and the relatively small number of observations, we investigate whether a partial system analysis delivers a different co-integration rank. Consider, for instance, the following partition of X t :</p><p>. In this case, we have included in Z t as initial step of the analysis a set of conditioning variables (the fixed-private investments and the inflation rate) which are expected to be I(1) but not co-integrated. Albeit Z t can potentially be co-integrated in our setup (see <ref type="table">Remark 3 and Table 3</ref>), our suggestion is that it may be convenient to start the analysis with this choice because it is often easier to make conjectures on which variables are likely to be no co-integrated, rather than on which variables should not adjust to the long run equilibria. Modelling Y t conditional on Z t requires considering a five-dimensional system as in equation (2) and, notably, we can apply BIC and HQC ignoring the weak exogeneity condition of Z t . Results are reported in the middle panel of <ref type="table">Table 5</ref>, which also reports, for completeness, the outcome of HJNR's sequential procedure. Although the asymptotic critical values associated with HJNR's test are computed under the assumption of weak exogeneity of Z t , the Monte Carlo evidence summarized in Tables 1-4 has shown that HJNR's test performs reasonably well in samples of length T = 100 irrespective of whether Z t is weakly exogenous or not (or co-integrated or</p><p>and expectations are conditional on the agents' information set F t , i.e. E t • :</p><p>The first equation is a forward-looking IS curve, the second is the New Keynesian Phillips curve and the third is the policy rule through which the Central Bank fixes the short term interest rate.x t = (x t − x n t ) is the output gap, where x t is the log of output and x n t the natural rate of output; t is the inflation rate and i t is the nominal policy interest rate; a,t , a =x, , i, are stochastic disturbances autocorrelated of order one, while u a,t , a =x, , i, can be interpreted as demand, supply and monetary shocks, respectively. The structural parameters are collected in the vector = <ref type="figure">( , , , , , , , x , x , , i , 2</ref> x , 2 , 2 i ) and their economic interpretation may be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Benati and Surico (2009)</ref>. Notice that system (9)-(12) does not specify how the natural rate of output is generated. To complete the model, we assume that x n t obeys the equation</p><p>where 0 is an additional auxiliary parameter. When = 0, x n t in equation <ref type="formula">13</ref>follows a driftless random walk which captures the effects of technology shocks and represents the I(1) stochastic trend driving system. With &lt; 0, instead, x n t is still I(1) but the natural growth rate of output is negatively tied to the level of the (ex post) real interest rate. System (9)-(13) with = 0 is analysed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bårdsen and Fanelli (2015)</ref> to investigate the testable implications of small DSGE models, including their common trend/cointegration properties. The appealing feature of system (9)-(13) is that, under particular conditions, the rational expectations solution of the DSGE model can be approximated by a four-dimensional (p = 4) co-integrated VAR system for X t := (x t , t , i t , x n t ) . More specifically, the testable co-integration implications of this DSGE model are captured by the term˜</p><p>which implies (true) co-integration rank r 0 = 3, and requires the 'output gap' x t − x n t , the inflation rate t and the policy rate i t to be jointly stationary. Moreover, it can be shown that when = 0 in equation (13), the variable x n t does not adjust to the three co-integrating relations, i.e. it is weakly exogenous with respect to =˜ in equation <ref type="bibr">(14)</ref>. In contrast, when &lt; 0, x n t adjusts to the inflation rate and the policy rate. Equation <ref type="bibr">(14)</ref> suggests that if the solution of the DSGE model (9)-(13) is captured by a VAR model for X t = (x t , t , i t , x n t ) , the system should be driven by a single stochastic trend representing the cumulated effects of technology shocks.</p><p>In this model, the natural rate of output x n t enters the co-integration relations in equation <ref type="formula">14</ref>. However, a practitioner might not be interested in modelling x n t directly within the</p></div>
