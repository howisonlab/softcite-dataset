			<abstract>
				<p>Multiple Rabs are associated with secretory granules/vesicles, but how these GTPases are coordinated to promote regulated exocytosis is not well understood. In bladder umbrella cells a subapical pool of discoidal/fusiform-shaped vesicles (DFVs) undergoes Rab11a-dependent regulated exocytosis in response to bladder filling. We show that Rab11aassociated vesicles are enmeshed in an apical cytokeratin meshwork and that Rab11a likely acts upstream of Rab8a to promote exocytosis. Surprisingly, expression of Rabin8, a previously described Rab11a effector and guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rab8, stimulates stretch-induced exocytosis in a manner that is independent of its catalytic activity. Additional studies demonstrate that the unconventional motor protein myosin5B motor (Myo5B) works in association with the Rab8a-Rab11a module to promote exocytosis, possibly by ensuring transit of DFVs through a subapical, cortical actin cytoskeleton before fusion. Our results indicate that Rab11a, Rab8a, and Myo5B function as part of a network to promote stretch-induced exocytosis, and we predict that similarly organized Rab networks will be common to other regulated secretory pathways.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>Rabs are a large family of small GTPases (44 subfamilies in humans) that regulate multiple steps in membrane traffic, including the uncoating, movement, maturation, tethering, and fusion of vesicles with their target membranes <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Diekmann et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Hutagalung and Novick, 2011)</ref>. Of the Rabs identified, Rab3 (a-d isoforms), Rab26, Rab27 (a and b isoforms), and Rab37 are referred to as "secretory" Rabs because of their association in neuroendocrine cells with regulated secretion <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Fukuda, 2008)</ref>; that is, those pathways in which a storage pool of secretory vesicles/granules fuses with the plasma membrane in response to extracellular stimuli. The role of other "nonsecretory" Rabs in regulated secretion is not well understood or documented, despite the association of many of these Rabs with purified secretory granules <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Brunner et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Casey et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Rindler et al., 2007)</ref> and observations that they can promote regulated secretion in different cell types <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Duman et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Khvotchev et al., 2003)</ref>. Furthermore, regulated secretory pathways often depend on multiple Rabs <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Fukuda, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Pavlos and Jahn, 2011)</ref>, but the hierarchy of these Rabs and their relationships to one another remain to be defined.</p><p>In bladder umbrella cells, Rab11a, a well-known regulator of endocytic recycling in other cell systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Ullrich et al., 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Casanova et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Lapierre et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Knodler et al., 2010)</ref>, is associated with an abundant subapical pool of discoidal/fusiform-shaped vesicles (DFVs), which are enriched in the apical membrane protein uroplakin 3a (UP3a; <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Khandelwal et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Hudoklin et al., 2012)</ref>, one of four major UP species that make up the asymmetric unit membrane of the umbrella cell <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Wu et al., 2009)</ref>. DFVs are distinct from <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Veranic and Jezernik, 2002)</ref>.

The proteins that are modulated by and act downstream of Rab11a to promote stretch-induced DFV exocytosis are unknown, although the cytoskeletal motor protein myosin 5B (Myo5B) is a known Rab11a effector, as well as Rab8a and Rab10 effector, in other cellular events <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Lapierre et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Volpicelli et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Wakabayashi et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Varthakavi et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Nedvetsky et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Swiatecka-Urban et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Provance et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Chu et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Roland et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Schuh, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Xu et al., 2011)</ref>.</p><p>To better understand the dependence of DFV exocytosis on Rab11a, we turned to an analogous, albeit constitutive secretory pathway that has been carefully dissected in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In this organism, newly synthesized secretory vesicles emerge from the late Golgi under the control of Ypt31p/32p, paralogues of Rab11 <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Benli et al., 1996)</ref>. GTP-bound Ypt31p/32p recruits Sec2p, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Sec4p. The Sec4p GTPase is homologous to Rab8 and associates with vesicles before their fusion with the emerging bud <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Ortiz et al., 2002)</ref>. An important effector in this system is Myo2p, a Myo5-like protein that interacts with both Ypt31p/32p and Sec4p and is responsible for actin-dependent delivery of the vesicles from the Golgi to the plasma membrane <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Lipatova et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Jin et al., 2011)</ref>. Furthermore, Myo2p associates with Sec15p, a component of the octameric exocyst complex that tethers secretory vesicles to the plasma membrane before fusion <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Jin et al., 2011)</ref>. Sec15p also serves as an effector of Sec4p <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Jin et al., 2011)</ref>, and by its reported binding to Sec2p it may aid in the recruitment of Sec4p <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Medkova et al., 2006)</ref>. We now show that an evolutionarily conserved Rab11a-Rab8a module along with Myo5B functions in umbrella cells to modulate stretch-induced DFV exocytosis.</p></div>

A well-known effector of Rab11a is the Myo5 motor protein, which promotes long-range as well as local actin-based movements <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Lapierre et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Volpicelli et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Wakabayashi et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Varthakavi et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Nedvetsky et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Swiatecka-Urban et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Provance et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Chu et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Roland et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Schuh, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Xu et al., 2011)</ref>.

In our studies we observed that the amount of actin staining is variable at this surface <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Acharya et al., 2004)</ref>, prompting us to explore different fixation protocols. We found that a critical factor was fixation at 37°C, and at this temperature a meshwork of actin was found at the apical surface ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1A</ref>). The cortical actin cytoskeleton was more apical than, and distinct from, an apical meshwork of cytokeratins, which was previously shown to encase clusters of DFVs ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1A</ref>; Right, inset, a magnified view of the boxed region in the parent image file.

These characteristics were apparent when the size and distribution of endogenous UP3a, Rab11a, and TGN-38 in umbrella cells were compared with cells expressing GFP-tagged Myo5B-tail (compare <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2A</ref> to <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>, B-D). The transduced samples contained large, vesicular-appearing, Myo5B-tail-positive clusters that showed extensive colocalization with UP3a or Rab11a <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">(Table 1)</ref>. In contrast to Rab11a and UP3a, the non-Myo5B cargo protein TGN-38 showed significantly less colocalization with the Myo5B-tail (p &lt; 0.5; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2D</ref> and <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>). Furthermore, when cross sections of GFP-(control) or GFP-Myo5B-expressing cells were examined by transmission electron microscopy, only the latter showed clusters of DFVs, which appeared smaller than vesicles observed in control cells ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2E</ref>). Stacks of Golgi appeared in proximity to, but distinct from, the clustered DFVs when cells were examined by electron microscopy ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2E</ref>). To determine whether Myo5B modulated stretch-induced exocytosis, we transduced umbrella cells with GFP-(control) or Myo5Btail-encoding adenoviruses and exposed the isolated bladders to experimental filling (i.e., stretch). As a measure of exocytosis, we monitored changes in capacitance (C T ; where 1 μF ≈ 1 cm 2 of surface area), which increase in response to stretch and show good concordance with other measures of exocytosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Truschel et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Khandelwal et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Yu et al., 2009)</ref>. Myo5B-tail caused a significant decrease in stretch-induced changes in C T compared with control tissues ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3A</ref>). The importance of Myo5B was also shown by experiments in which umbrella cells were transduced with both Myo5B-tail and human growth hormone, which is packaged into DFV and secreted in response to bladder filling <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Kerr et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Khandelwal et al., 2008)</ref>. In these studies, Myo5B-tail caused a significant ∼70% decrease in growth hormone release after 2 h of filling the bladders ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3B</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Rab8a acts with Rab11a to regulate DFV exocytosis</head><p>Our next goal was to examine whether Rab11a worked in conjunction with Rab8 to promote DFV exocytosis. Reverse transcription (RT)-PCR confirmed the expression of Rab8a/b in the uroepithelium ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1B</ref>). Because we could not find an Rab8aor Rab8b-selective antibody for use in our studies, we used an antibody that recognizes both isoforms of this GTPase. Thus, when describing the localization of Rab8, we do not make a distinction between its two isoforms. Rab8 was associated with punctate vesicular structures at the apical pole of the cell that colocalized with UPs ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4</ref>, A and B, and <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>). We also observed Rab8-positive vesicles that were localized in the bottom half of the umbrella cell ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figures 4A and 5F</ref>). These likely represent Rab8-positive vesicular intermediates involved in other trafficking events such as transport of newly synthesized proteins to the basolateral cell surface <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Huber et al., 1993)</ref>. When umbrella cells were transduced with the GFP-tagged, dominant-negative mutant Rab8aT 22 N (DN-Rab8a), there was a significant decrease in stretch-induced changes in C T ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4C</ref>). We previously reported that changes in C T were not observed in quiescent tissues not exposed to stretch <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Truschel et al., 2002)</ref>. However, expression of dominant-active RFP-tagged Rab8a-Q 67 L (DA-Rab8a) caused a significant increase in C T above stretched or unstretched control tissues ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4D</ref>). This last phenotype was similarly Both Myo5A and Myo5B mRNA expression were detected in the uroepithelium ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1B</ref>). Because Myo5B is a well-known effector of Rab11a <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Lapierre et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Volpicelli et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Wakabayashi et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Varthakavi et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Nedvetsky et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Swiatecka-Urban et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Provance et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Chu et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Roland et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Schuh, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Xu et al., 2011)</ref>, we focused on this isoform. Its expression was confirmed by immunofluorescence analysis, which showed that endogenous Myo5B localized to punctate vesicular elements, reminiscent of DFV, just underneath the apical domain of the umbrella cells. Myo5B was also observed in the upper cytoplasm of the first layer of intermediate cells ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1C</ref>), which also have DFVs <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Apodaca, 2004)</ref>, and in cells in the underlying lamina propria (examples are marked with an asterisk in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1C</ref>). The association of Myo5B with DFV was confirmed by showing that Myo5B colocalized with the DFV cargo molecule UP3a ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1D</ref>; see <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> for colocalization coefficients). Myo5B also colocalized, but to a somewhat lesser extent, with the DFV marker protein Rab11a ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1E</ref> and <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>).</p><p>As further evidence of an interaction between Myo5B and DFV, we transduced umbrella cells in situ using an adenovirus expressing the C-terminal cargo-binding domain of Myo5B fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP; Myo5B-tail; <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Lapierre et al., 2001)</ref>.

Whereas this increase was measured in excised tissue, voiding in vivo is accompanied by a rapid and complete recovery of all added membrane <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Khandelwal et al., 2010)</ref>. Thus any DA-Rab8a (or Rab11a)-induced increase in umbrella cell surface area would likely be counteracted at each cycle of voiding.</p><p>Next we determined whether Rab11a and Rab8a acted in the same network to regulate stretch-induced exocytosis. If true, we reasoned that DN-Rab11a should impair DA-Rab8a-stimulated exocytic events and that DN-Rab8a should inhibit DA-Rab11adependent increases. Indeed, this is what we observed ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5A</ref>). We were unable to evaluate the effects of expressing both DN-Rab8a and DN-Rab11a on exocytosis, as this caused severe defects in transepithelial resistance. Because these experiments do not resolve which GTPase acts upstream of the other, we performed the following analysis. First, we observed that expression of GFPtagged DN-Rab11a resulted in a reduction in the subapical accumulation and apparent intensity of Rab8-positive vesicles ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure  5B</ref>). In contrast, expression of DN-Rab8a did not appear to impair the apical localization or apparent intensity of Rab11a-positive DFVs ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5C</ref>). These results are consistent with the possibility that Rab11a functions upstream of Rab8, possibly by recruiting  The excised bladders were mounted in Ussing stretch chambers and either left in a quiescent state (no stretch) or subjected to stretch at t = 0.

Values significantly different from control are indicated with an asterisk. possibility that Rabin8 was recruited to DFVs by Rab11a. This effect was not observed in cells expressing DN-Rab8a ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 6E</ref>). Expression of GFP alone did not alter the distribution of Rabin8 ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 6F</ref>). Next we examined the effects of expressing wild-type GFP-tagged Rabin8, which we predicted would activate Rab8a and like DA-Rab8a would stimulate exocytosis. Expression of GFP-tagged wildtype Rabin8 had no significant effect in the absence of stretch but significantly increased exocytosis in stretched tissues ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 6G</ref>). We also expressed a mutant GFP-tagged Rabin8 (Rabin8-L 196 A/ F 201 A; Rabin8-AA), which lacks Rab8 GEF activity and is believed to act in a dominant-negative manner to suppress Rab8 activation <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Park et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bossu et al., 2000)</ref>. Expression of Rabin8-AA had no effect on the distribution of Rab8, or for that matter of Rab11a or Myo5b ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 6</ref>, H-J), but like wild-type Rabin8 caused a significant stimulation of stretch-induced exocytosis ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 6K</ref>). This stimulation was reversed at later time points if Rabin8-AA was coexpressed with DN-Rab8a ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 6K</ref>), indicating that the Rabin8-AA-mediated increase in exocytosis was at least partially the result of Rab8adependent exocytosis. We were unable to assess the effect of coexpressing DN-Rab11a and Rabin8-AA, as this combination caused a large decrease in transepithelial resistance. Taken together, these results indicate that Rabin8 is recruited to DFVs by Rab11a, where it apparently modulates stretch-induced exocytosis in a manner that is independent of its GEF activity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Relationship between Myo5B and Rab8a-and Rab11adependent DFV exocytosis</head><p>To determine the relationship of Myo5B to the Rab11a-Rab8 network, we first examined the effects of coexpressing the Myo5B-tail To further examine the relationship between the Rab8-and Rab11a-positive vesicles and the apical membrane, we performed additional localization studies. In addition to finding Rab8-positive DFVs that were also Rab11a positive ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5D</ref> and <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>), we also observed a pool of Rab8-positive vesicles that appeared to be closer to the apical pole of the cell and thus nearer to the apical plasma membrane. This was more apparent when we compared the distribution of Rab11a and Rab8 to the cytokeratin meshwork. Whereas Rab11a-positive DFVs were mostly found within the network ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5E</ref>), those subapical DFVs that were only Rab8 positive were observed outside the cytokeratin meshwork and thus in closer proximity to the apical plasma membrane than Rab11a-positive DFVs ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5F</ref>). Unfortunately, we could not find an antibody combination that allowed us to examine the position of Rab8/Rab11apositive vesicles relative to the cytokeratin meshwork. The proximity of Rab8-positive DFVs to the apical membrane is further evidence that Rab8 may function downstream of Rab11a.</p><p>Ciliogenesis and apical lumen formation are both dependent on the Rab11a-dependent recruitment of Rabin8, a GEF that promotes activation and recruitment of Rab8a to Rab11a-positive vesicles <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Hattula et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Bryant et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Knodler et al., 2010)</ref>. In umbrella cells, Rabin8 appeared in a subapical, punctate distribution ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 6A</ref>) and colocalized with Rab11a-or Rab8-positive DFVs ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 6</ref>, B and C, and <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>). Furthermore, we observed that expression of DN-Rab11a caused endogenous Rabin8 to appear scattered throughout the cytoplasm ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 6D</ref>), consistent with the   with Rab10, also impaired exocytosis ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 7B</ref>). In contrast, the Myo5B-tail-QLYC, which cannot interact with Rab8a, failed to block stretch-induced exocytosis ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 7B</ref>), indicating that Myo5B may be acting downstream of this GTPase. Consistent with the latter possibility, we measured some overlap between Myo5B and Rab8 ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 7C</ref> and <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>) and also noted that, like Rab8, a population of Myo5B-positive vesicles extended beyond the cytokeratin matrix and were in close apposition to the plasma membrane ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 7D)</ref>.</p><p>However, other studies indicated that the interplay between Myo5B and Rab8a was more complex than a simple one-on-one interaction. First, as noted previously, there was a population of Rab11a-positive DFVs that were also positive for Myo5B ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1E</ref>). Furthermore, expression of the Myo5B-tail caused Rab11a-positive vesicles to cluster ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2C)</ref>. Second, the subapical distribution of Myo5B was not obviously affected by expression of DN-Rab8a with either DA-Rab8a or DA-Rab11a. We observed that Myo5B-tail impaired the ability of these mutants to stimulate increases in DFV exocytosis ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 7A</ref>), indicating that Myo5B acted within the same network as Rab11a and Rab8a. Next we sought to determine which GTPase acted upstream of Myo5B to promote DFV exocytosis. We expressed mutant Myo5B cargo-binding domains that cannot form interactions with either Rab8a, or Rab10, or Rab11a ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 7B</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Roland et al., 2011)</ref>. Myo5B does not interact with Rab8b <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Roland et al., 2007)</ref>. In the simplest case, for example, when Myo5B acts solely downstream of Rab11a, we expected that wild-type Myo5Btail (or mutants lacking the Rab8a or Rab10 interaction sites) would inhibit exocytosis, whereas a mutant lacking the Rab11a interaction site (Myo5B-tail-YEQR) would not. Surprisingly, Myo5B-tail-YEQR inhibited these trafficking events ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 7B</ref>). Likewise, Myo5B-tail-∆D exon , which lacks the D exon of the protein and does not interact 2002; <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Veranic and Jezernik, 2002)</ref>. DFVs must then move through the subapical actin cytoskeleton, which we describe in this study, before soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE)-dependent fusion with the apical membrane <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Born et al., 2003)</ref>.</p><p>Because Rab11a does not colocalize with the umbrella cell TGN <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Khandelwal et al., 2008)</ref> and Rab11a-positive DFVs are generally encased within the subapical cytokeratin cytoskeleton, we hypothesize that Rab11a acts subsequent to DFV release from the TGN and may be important in modulating vesicle transit through the cytokeratin meshwork and the initial aspects of the subapical actin network <ref type="figure">(Figure 8</ref>). In addition, Rab11a likely fosters DFV maturation by recruiting the downstream Rab8a GTPase. The mechanism by which Rab11a recruits Rab8a in umbrella cells is unknown. Whereas Rabin8 is apparently recruited to DFVs downstream of Rab11a, it is unlikely to be the relevant Rab8 GEF because its overexpression stimulates exocytosis irrespective of its GEF activity. How it does so is unclear, but it is possible that the amount of Rabin8 is normally limiting and overexpression potentiates interactions with binding partners, which positively regulate the Rab11a-Rab8a pathway in umbrella cells (independent of Rabin8's GEF activity). Alternatively, the Rabin8-interacting proteins may act as negative regulators of exocytosis, and binding to Rabin8 relieves this inhibition. Although the target of Rabin8 in DFV exocytosis is unknown, studies reported interactions between Rabin8 and Rab3a, Rheb, SSX2, ad Sec15 <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Brondyk et al., 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">de Bruijn et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Parkhitko et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Feng et al., 2012)</ref>. Finally, if we assume a Rab cascade is operative, then after its recruitment, Rab8a is likely to enlist a Rab11a GAP, the identity of which is unknown but may include putative Rab11a GAPs described in other studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Fukuda, 2011)</ref>. Although a Rab cascade ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 7E</ref>). Furthermore, Rab8-positive vesicles showed only a small degree of colocalization with Myo5B-tail-induced clusters ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 7F</ref>; Manders' coefficient M Y = 0.23 ± 0.07), and almost no colocalization was measured when the intensities of the Myo5B-tail clusters were compared with those for Rab8 (M X = 0.04 ± 0.01; <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>). However, we did note that Rab8-positive DFVs appeared dispersed and fragmented under these conditions. Similar results were obtained for Rabin8 <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">(Table 1</ref>). In sum, the data indicate a role for Myo5B within the Rab8a/Rab11a network; however, the interaction is likely to be more complex than a simple recruitment of Myo5B by one or the other GTPase in this module.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>Our studies show that Rab11a, which we previously implicated in DFV exocytosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Khandelwal et al., 2008)</ref>, acts as a partner in a connected network of proteins that also likely includes Rab8a and Myo5B. A Rab11-Rab8-Myo5B network has been described for the biogenesis of cilia and apical lumen formation <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Bryant et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Knodler et al., 2010)</ref>, and a homologous Ypt31/32p-Sec4p-Myo2p yeast pathway has been implicated in yeast exocytosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Ortiz et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Medkova et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Jin et al., 2011)</ref>. However, the connection of these conserved pathways to regulated secretion was not previously appreciated.</p><p>In ciliogenesis, in lumen formation, and in the yeast secretory system, the Rab11-Rab8 network is believed to be arranged as a "cascade" that promotes a process termed Rab conversion or maturation <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Rink et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Hutagalung and Novick, 2011)</ref>. During this conversion, Rab11 present on an upstream compartment engages a GEF for Rab8 (e.g., Rabin8), stimulating Rab8's conversion from an inactive, GDP-bound state to an active, GTP-bound state and recruitment to the membrane <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Knodler et al., 2010)</ref>. In its GTP-bound state, active Rab8 recruits effector proteins to the compartment, modifying its membrane and further promoting vesicular movements and fusion <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Barr and Lambright, 2010)</ref>. Effectors include specific GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), which, when recruited by Rab8, promote the transformation of GTP-bound Rab11 to its GDPbound state, preserving compartmental identity by inactivation of the upstream Rab (Rivera-Molina and Novick, 2009; <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Barr and Lambright, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Bryant et al., 2010)</ref>.

Additional support for this possibility is the finding that DFVs undergo a maturation process as they exit from the TGN and their lumens become increasingly acidic <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Guo et al., 2009)</ref>, and in rodents (but not humans or rabbits), a shape change occurs as DFVs transition from discoidal shaped to one that is fusiform in appearance as they move toward the apical pole of the cell <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Hudoklin et al., 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Hudoklin et al., , 2012</ref>. Superimposed on this maturation is DFV transport to the surface, which depends, in part, on a dense subapical cytokeratin network, which encases the DFVs and in response to filling moves the enmeshed vesicles toward the apical pole of the cell as the cytokeratins are "pulled" from a random orientation to one that aligns parallel to the apical surface of the umbrella cell <ref type="bibr">(Truschel et al.,</ref><ref type="bibr">FIGURE 8</ref>: Model for hypothesized role of the Rab11a-Rab8a-Myo5B network in regulating DFV exocytosis. Newly synthesized DFVs exit the TGN, where they associate with Rab11a, which may facilitate DFV passage through the cytokeratin meshwork. In one scenario, Rab11a may promote early recruitment of the Myo5B motor. In addition, Rab11a stimulates DFV maturation by recruiting Rab8a to the vesicles. The GEF is unknown but is apparently not Rabin8, which is recruited to DFVs by Rab11a and may modulate exocytosis through other effector proteins (not shown). In turn, Rab8a recruits an unknown Rab11a GAP, which would terminate the Rab11a-dependent steps and maintain compartment identity. Myo5B may also be recruited by Rab8a, but the interaction is likely to be ephemeral and may be stabilized by other proteins, including the exocyst subunit Sec15 and SNARE proteins (not shown).

Finally, Myo5A can also form interactions with Rab8, Rab11, and Rab27 <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Roland et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Rudolf et al., 2011)</ref>, so this motor may also play an important role in DFV exocytosis.</p><p>In addition to Rab11a and Rab8a, Rab27b is also reported to interact with a subset of DFVs <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Chen et al., 2003)</ref>. Technically, Rab27b could act upstream or downstream of this Rab11a/8a network; however, we previously reported that there are at least two populations of DFVs: a preexisting pool that undergoes rapid exocytosis, and one that requires new protein synthesis and only slowly fuses with the apical membrane <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Balestreire and Apodaca, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Yu et al., 2009)</ref>. Therefore it is possible that Rab27b associates with one of these vesicle pools and Rab11a/8a with the other. This could also explain why none of the dominant-negative constructs we used gave an all-or-none response and may also speak to possible Rab targets of Rabin8 that may modulate the Rab11a/8a pathway.</p><p>An important prediction of our work is that Rab/myosin motor networks and possibly cascades will be common to other regulated secretory system. Support for this proposition includes the following: 1) Purified synaptic vesicles, insulin secretory granules, and zymogen granules contain 10-30 Rabs <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Takamori et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Brunner et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Rindler et al., 2007)</ref>. Putting aside the possibility that contamination with other organelles contributes to this tally, multiple, sequentially acting Rabs would ensure that the complex process of secretory granule maturation occurs in an orderly and vectorial manner and that exocytosis is properly timed and of the correct duration. 2) Exocytosis in neuroendocrine cells requires Rab3 isoforms <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Fukuda, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Pavlos and Jahn, 2011)</ref>. However, neurons lacking expression of all four Rab3 isoforms only show a 30% loss of stimulated neurotransmitter release <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Schluter et al., 2004)</ref>. Thus other Rabs, most likely Rab27 isoforms, are likely to be involved <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Fukuda, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Pavlos and Jahn, 2011)</ref>. Of interest, Rab3 and Rab27 share effectors and GEFs, and both act at late stages in the regulated exocytic response <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Tsuboi and Fukuda, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Handley et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Pavlos et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Pavlos and Jahn, 2011)</ref>. 3) Myosin motors, particularly Myo5A, are common requirements for regulated secretion <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Rudolf et al., 2011)</ref>, and, as noted, can promote vesicle motility as well as vesicle tethering and fusion. Based on our insights into umbrella cell exocytosis, it is likely that Rab3 and Rab27 also form a Rab cascade or network, and their sequential functions will be important in modulating the broad array of regulated secretory pathways that depend on these proteins for their function <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Fukuda, 2008)</ref>.</p></div>

Indeed, we observed colocalization between Rab11a and Myo5B, as well as colocalization between Myo5B and Rab8. Furthermore, Myo5B was associated with vesicles that were in close proximity to the plasma membrane. We also noted that a Myo5B-tail mutant lacking an Rab11a-interacting motif (Myo5B-tail-YEQR) impaired exocytosis. In contrast, a mutant Myo5B-tail that lacked an Rab8a-interacting motif (Myo5B-tail-QLYC) failed to inhibit exocytosis. In the simplest scenario, in which MyoVb forms an interaction with only the Rab8 GTPase, these results would indicate that a Rab8a-Myo5B interaction was critical for this process. However, interactions between Myo5 family motors and both Rab8 and Rab11 homologues have been reported in both yeast and mammalian cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Lipatova et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Jin et al., 2011)</ref>. Thus an additional scenario, which may better fit our data, is that Myo5B forms interactions with both GTPases <ref type="figure">(Figure 8</ref>). This would explain why a fraction of Rab11a colocalizes with Myo5B and why Myo5B-tail clusters Rab11a-positive DFVs. In this second scenario, Myo5B-tail-YEQR would inhibit DFV exocytosis by perturbing the interaction between Myo5B and the downstream Rab8a GTPase. In contrast, expression of Myo5B-tail-QLYC, which retains its Rab11a-interacting motif, would primarily affect the upstream, Rab11a-dependent reaction, and not the downstream Rab8a one. On the assumption that sufficient Rab8a-positive DFVs were available under these conditions, their exocytosis would proceed, apparently unimpeded by expression of this mutant.</p><p>We also observed that Rab8-positive vesicles were not efficiently recruited into Myo5B-induced clusters and that expression of DN-Rab8a failed to affect the distribution of Myo5B. At first take, these observations appear to be inconsistent with a role for Rab8a in recruiting Myo5B. However, some provisos are worth noting. First, expression of Myo5B-tail was not without effect, as the Rab8-positive vesicles appeared smaller and dispersed in their distribution. Second, in cells expressing Myo5B-tail the affinity of Rab8a for Myo5B may be less than that of Rab8a for other interacting proteins such as Myo5A <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Roland et al., 2007)</ref>, which is also expressed in umbrella cells. If so, Myo5A (or other interacting partners) may "pull" Rab8 out of the Myo5B-induced clusters or prevent Rab8a-positive vesicles from being incorporated into these clusters. Additional Rab8a-interacting proteins include Rab11a. Furthermore, the yeast Myo2p motor interacts with the Sec15 subunit of the exocyst, an octomeric complex that may promote vesicle tethering before fusion with the plasma membrane <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Jin et al., 2011)</ref>, and other Myo5 motors interact with SNARE components, including syntaxins and vesicle-associated membrane proteins <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Prekeris and Terrian, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Watanabe et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bond et al., 2011)</ref>. Any one or combination of these proteins could act to effect Myo5B localization in the absence of Rab8a. Although our studies support an important role for Myo5B in DFV, additional studies are needed to understand the further stimulate DFV exocytosis and fusion.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Immunofluorescence labeling, image acquisition, and measurement of colocalization</head><p>Bladder tissue was fixed and processed as described <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Khandelwal et al., 2008)</ref>; however, the Rab8 antibody only reacted if the following procedure was followed. After the frozen tissue was crosssectioned and rehydrated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), we performed antigen retrieval by incubating the tissue for 7 min with quench buffer (20 mM glycine, pH 8.0, and 75 mM NH 4 Cl dissolved in PBS) containing 0.1% Triton X-100. This was followed by a 3-min incubation in quench buffer containing 0.05% SDS and 0.1% Triton X-100. The tissue was then quickly rinsed three times with PBS and then three times for 5 min in the same buffer. When mounting the tissues, we found that enhanced image quality could be obtained if postfixation the tissues were rinsed with 100 mM Tris, pH 8.0, and then treated for 1-2 min each with ascending concentrations of thiodiethanol <ref type="bibr">(50, 75, and 97% [vol/vol]</ref>) dissolved in the same buffer <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Staudt et al., 2007)</ref>. The samples were then mounted in 97% thiodiethanol/Tris buffer containing 0.01% (wt/vol) phenylenediamine and stored at −20°C. The 97% thiodiethanol has the same refractive index as our immersion oil (1.1518). Although this solution worked well for proteins labeled with secondary antibodies, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-phalloidin and To-Pro3 were quickly leached out the samples, necessitating the use of our standard glycerol-based mounting medium for these markers <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Acharya et al., 2004)</ref>. Images were captured using an HCX PL APO 63×/numerical aperture (NA) 1.3 glycerol objective (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) or a Leica STED 100×/NA 1.4 oil objective and the appropriate laser lines of a Leica TCS SP5 CW-STED confocal microscope (in normal confocal mode). The photomultipliers were set at 900-1200, and 8-bit images were collected using four to eight line averages combined with four to eight frame averages. Serial 0.25-μm z-sections were acquired. The images were imported into Volocity 4D software (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA) and, after image reconstruction, exported as TIFF files. The contrast of the latter was corrected in Photoshop CS5 (Adobe, San Jose, CA), and the composite images were prepared in Adobe Illustrator CS5.</p><p>Measures of colocalization were performed using Volocity software, and Manders' colocalization coefficients were calculated as previously described <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Khandelwal et al., 2008)</ref>. Briefly, stacks of dual-labeled confocal sections were imported into Volocity, background noise was removed using the fine (3 × 3) median noise reduction filter, and a scatter plot of green and red pixel intensities (associated with each of the two markers in question) was generated using the colocalization function. A constant threshold of 40 was applied to both channels of the image stack, and Manders' colocalization coefficients for each of two markers (M X and M Y , respectively) were calculated for the entire three-dimensional image stack using the following equations <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Manders et al., 1993)</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">M X = X i,colocalized colocalized i X i i and M Y = Y i, i Y i i ∑ ∑ ∑ ∑</formula><p>where X i is equal to the intensity of marker X at a given voxel and X i,colocalized = X i if the associated intensity of the other marker (Y i ) is above the threshold value (i.e., it colocalizes). However, X i,colocalized = 0 if Y i is below the threshold value (i.e., does not colocalize). Y i is equal to the intensity of marker Y at a given voxel and Y i,colocalized = Y i if X i is above the threshold value and Y i,colocalized = 0 if X i is Fluorophore-or horseradish peroxidase-labeled, affinity-purified and minimal cross-reacting goat or donkey secondary antibodies were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA). Rhodamine phalloidin and TO-PRO3 were obtained from Molecular Probes-Invitrogen (Grand Island, NY).</p></div>

RNA was treated with DNase I and cDNA generated using the RETROscript First Strand Synthesis Kit (Life Technologies). PCR was performed using Taq polymerase (Life Technologies). The primers used were as follows: Myo5A, GTG GGG CAA AAG AGA C and TCA GAC CCT TGC AAT GAA GCC; Myo5B, GCA GCC CAA CTC CTT CAG and TCA GAC TTC ATT GAG GAA CTC; Rab8a, ATG GCG AAG ACC TAC GAT TAC C and TCA CAG GAG ACT GCA CCG G; and Rab8b, ATG GCG AAG ACG TAC GAT TAT CTG and TCA AAG CAG AGA ACA CCG GAA G.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preparation of adenoviruses and in situ transduction of umbrella cells</head><p>Adenoviruses expressing GFP, GFP-tagged DN-Rab11aS 25 N, DA-Rab11aS 20 V, and hGH were described previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Khandelwal et al., 2008)</ref>. GFP-tagged Myo5B-tail mutants showing reduced affinity for Rab8a (Myo5B-QLYC), Rab10 (Myo5B-∆D exon ), or Rab11a (Myo5B-YEQR) were described previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Roland et al., 2011)</ref>. Adenoviruses were made by cloning the appropriate cDNAs into the plasmid pAdlox. Rab8a was cloned into pAdlox, and adenoviruses expressing RFP-tagged DA-Rab8aQ 67 L and GFP-tagged DN-Rab8aT 22 N were made by mutating Glu 67 to Lys and Ser 22 to Val in Rab8a-pAdlox using the QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). cDNA for human Rabin8a was obtained from Addgene (Cambridge, MA) and subcloned into pAdlox. The QuikChange Kit was then used to generate the Rabin8a-F 201 A/L 196 A mutant. Adenoviruses were prepared and purified, and bladders were transduced in situ using our previously described methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Khandelwal et al., 2008)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Estimation of hGH secretion</head><p>Rat bladders were transduced in situ with adenoviruses expressing hGH alone or in combination with Myo5B-tail or GFP. The bladders were filled, and hGH released into the bladder lumen was collected and Western blots quantified as described <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Khandelwal et al., 2008)</ref>.</p><p>Mounting rat bladder in Ussing stretch chambers and measuring C T Rats were killed, and bladders were excised, cut open, and then mounted in a Ussing stretch chamber with the mucosal surface facing an enclosed stretch hemichamber <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Khandelwal et al., 2008)</ref>. After a 1-h period of equilibration, bladder filling was simulated by slowly adding Krebs buffer to the mucosal hemichamber. The chamber was then sealed, and an additional solution was added to below the threshold value. An M X (or M Y ) value of 1.0 indicates that the ratio for all X intensity values that have a corresponding Y intensity (i.e., are colocalized), divided by the sum of all X intensity values is 100%. In contrast, a value of 0.0 indicates that there is no colocalization. We previously reported combinations of markers that had minimal colocalization <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Khandelwal et al., 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Khandelwal et al., , 2010</ref>, and for this study we colocalized MyoVb and nuclei, which had minimal overlap and resulted in a coefficient that approached zero (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>). The values for M X and M Y can be similar or not, as the values are intensity weighted, and in addition one marker may have a broader distribution than the other in the sampled region of the tissue.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Electron microscopy</head><p>Bladder tissue was isolated and then fixed with 2.0% (vol/vol) glutaraldehyde and 2% (wt/vol) paraformaldehyde in 100 mM sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.5 mM MgCl 2 and 1 mM CaCl 2 for 60 min. The tissue was then cut into small pieces, washed with 100 mM sodium cacodylate, pH 7.4, cut into small blocks (2-5 mm in size), and then postfixed in 1.0% (wt/vol) OsO 4 and 1.0% (wt/vol) K 4 Fe(CN) 6 , in 100 mM sodium cacodylate, pH 7.4. After a wash with water, the samples were en bloc stained overnight in 0.5% (wt/vol) uranyl acetate. The tissues were then dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol, and after incubation in propylene oxide, embedded in the epoxy resin LX-112 (Ladd, Burlington, VT) and cured 2 d at 60°C. Embedded tissue was sectioned with a diamond knife (Diatome, Fort Washington, PA), and sections, silver to pale gold in color, were mounted on Butvarcoated nickel grids, contrasted with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and viewed at 80 kV in a 100 CX electron microscope (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan). Images were captured using an L9C Peltier-cooled transmission electron microscopy camera system (Scientific Instruments and Applications, Duluth, GA). Digital images were imported into Adobe Lightroom, and the images were processed by using the brightness, contrast, and clarity controls. When contrast was too low, adjustments to the tone curve were made to the whole image. Images were sharpened using a radius of 0.5, and luminance noise reduction was performed. The composite images were assembled using Adobe Illustrator CS5.</p></div>
