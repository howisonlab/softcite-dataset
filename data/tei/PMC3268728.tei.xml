			<abstract>
				<p>Ribosomal S6 kinase 1 (RSK1) belongs to a family of proteins with two kinase domains. Following activation in the cytoplasm by extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2), it mediates the cell-proliferative, cell-growth, and survival-promoting actions of a number of growth factors and other agonists. These diverse biological actions of RSK1 involve regulation of both cytoplasmic and nuclear events. However, the mechanisms that permit nuclear accumulation of RSK1 remain unknown. Here, we show that phosphorylation of RSK1 on S221 is important for its dissociation from the type Iα regulatory subunit of protein kinase A (PKA) in the cytoplasm and that RSK1 contains a bipartite nuclear localization sequence that is necessary for its nuclear entry. Once inside, the active RSK1 is retained in the nucleus via its interactions with PKA catalytic subunit and AKAP95. Mutations of RSK1 that do not affect its activity but disrupt its entry into the nucleus or expression of AKAP95 forms that do not enter the nucleus inhibit the ability of active RSK1 to stimulate DNA synthesis. Our findings identify novel mechanisms by which active RSK1 accumulates in the nucleus and also provide new insights into how AKAP95 orchestrates cell cycle progression.</p>

Among the four isoforms of RSKs that are products of different genes, RSK1, RSK2, and RSK3 share significant sequence similarity; RSK4 is longer than the other isoforms and may also be functionally different <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Frodin and Gammeltoft, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Dummler et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Anjum and Blenis, 2008)</ref>. Despite their similarity, RSK1, RSK2, and RSK3 are not functionally redundant. Thus, although RSK1 and RSK3 show normal overlapping expression patterns with RSK2 in brains of patients with Coffin-Lowry syndrome, in which RSK2 is mutated, the functions of the mutant RSK2 are not replaced by the other isoforms <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Jacquot et al., 1998)</ref>. Likewise, whereas RSK1 can differentiate PC12 cells, RSK2 is not effective <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Silverman et al., 2004)</ref>, and RSK1, but not the other isoforms, regulates lung cancer cell motility and metastasis <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Lara et al., 2011)</ref>.</p><p>The RSKs are the immediate downstream effectors of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) and mediate the growthpromoting, proliferative, and antiapoptotic actions of growth factors and agonists that activate this pathway <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Frodin and Gammeltoft, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Anjum and Blenis, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Cargnello and Roux, 2011)</ref>. In keeping with their role as positive modulators of cell proliferation and growth, RSK1 and RSK2 levels are elevated in ductal and lobular human breast cancer tissues, as well as in 50% of prostate tumors, and inhibition of RSK1 and RSK2 activities results in decreased cell growth <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Clark et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Smith et al., 2005)</ref>. RSK1 also plays a profound role in neuronal differentiation, as demonstrated by the finding that constitutively active RSK1 is sufficient to elicit neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Silverman et al., 2004)</ref>. This observation also suggests that the prolonged ERK1/2 activation that is necessary for PC12 cell differentiation <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Vaudry et al., 2002)</ref> is mediated by activating the downstream kinase RSK1. The role of RSK1 in promoting cell survival has been demonstrated using dominant-negative forms</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Phosphorylation of Ser-221 on RSK1 is necessary to dissociate it from PKARIα and permit its nuclear localization</head><p>Because previous reports suggested that the fully active RSK1 is localized to the nucleus, initially, we determined whether the last phosphorylation (Ser-221 in the NTK; <ref type="figure">Figure 1A</ref>) that fully activates RSK1 is necessary for its nuclear localization. Ser-221 is phosphorylated by PDK1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Jensen et al., 1999)</ref>. Therefore, as the first approach, we determined whether inhibition of PDK1 attenuated phosphorylation of S221 and altered the nuclear localization of RSK1.

Following docking onto RSK1, ERK1/2 phosphorylates T573 in the activation loop of the C-terminal kinase (CTK), as well as T359 and S363 in the linker region that joins the N-terminal kinase (NTK) and CTK <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Frodin and Gammeltoft, 1999)</ref>. Phosphorylation of T573 activates the CTK, and this domain can then phosphorylate S380 in the linker region <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Frodin and Gammeltoft, 1999)</ref>. Phosphorylation of S380 provides a docking site for phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Frodin et al., 2000</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Frodin et al., , 2002</ref>, which can then phosphorylate S221 in the activation loop of the NTK <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Jensen et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Richards et al., 1999)</ref> and permits RSK1 to phosphorylate its downstream substrates <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Frodin and Gammeltoft, 1999)</ref>.

(A) Schematic of phosphorylation sites on rat RSK1. (B) Top two rows, serum-starved HeLa cells were treated with and without EGF (100 nM) for 10 min and the localization of total RSK1 was monitored with anti-RSK1 antibody; 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining shows nuclei. Bottom four rows, the PDK1 inhibitor BX795 inhibits nuclear translocation of RSK1. HeLa cells were treated as described above with and without overnight preincubation with 0.5 μM BX795. The localization of active RSK1 was monitored with anti-phospho-T573-RSK antibody. (C) BX795 inhibits phosphorylation of RSK1 on S221 and S732. Cells were treated as in B. After immunoprecipitation with anti-RSK1 antibody, Western analyses of the immune complexes were performed with anti-phospho RSK antibodies. Scale bar, 10 μm. Representative data from three independent experiments are shown.</p><p>in <ref type="figure">Figure 1B</ref> (top two rows), in the absence of epidermal growth factor (EGF), endogenous RSK1, detected by the anti-RSK1 antibody, was localized mainly in the cytoplasm, with very little being present in the nucleus. However, after EGF treatment, considerable increase in the nuclear localization of the endogenous RSK1 was observed ( <ref type="figure">Figure 1B</ref>, top two rows). Similarly, use of anti-phospho-Thr-573 antibody showed that there is very little active phospho-Thr-573 RSK1 in serum-starved HeLa cells ( <ref type="figure">Figure 1B</ref>, third row). On stimulation with EGF, the endogenous phospho-RSK1 in HeLa cells was localized mainly in the nucleus, as reported before <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Richards et al., 2001)</ref>, and exposure of cells to the PDK1 inhibitor BX795 decreased the EGF-mediated nuclear localization of RSK1 ( <ref type="figure">Figure 1B</ref>, bottom three rows). Of note, the PDK1 inhibitor did not affect RSK1 phosphorylation in the activation loop (Thr-573) of the C-terminal kinase, the linker region (Thr-359/Ser-363), and Ser-380, which forms the PDK1-binding site ( <ref type="figure">Figure 1C</ref>). However, consistent with its role as PDK1 inhibitor, BX795 inhibited the phosphorylation of Ser-221 (the PDK1 site) and Ser-732, the site on RSK1 that is autophosphorylated by its NTK <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Roux et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr">Figure 1C)</ref>. These data suggest that Ser-221 phosphorylation is necessary for nuclear localization of RSK1. To more carefully examine the role of Ser-221 in nuclear localization of RSK1, we expressed hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged wildtype RSK1 and HA-RSK1 harboring substitutions of Ser-221 with either Ala (S221A), which cannot be phosphorylated, or Asp (S221D) to mimic phosphorylation at this site. As shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>, A and B, upon EGF treatment of HeLa cells, the wild-type RSK1 localized to the nucleus. However, EGF did not enhance nuclear accumulation of the S221A mutant of RSK1. On the other hand, like its wild-type counterpart, the S221D form of RSK1 was localized to the nucleus after EGF treatment of HeLa cells ( <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>, A and B). Consistent with the role of S221 phosphorylation in the activation of RSK1, in in vitro kinase assays, the S221A form of RSK1 was inactive and did not exhibit any kinase activity ( <ref type="figure">Figure 2C</ref>). In contrast, the S221D form of RSK1 was activated upon EGF addition but was not active without EGF treatment of HeLa cells ( <ref type="figure">Figure 2C</ref>). This is consistent with the findings that in addition to phosphorylation of S221 (or a negative charge at this position) in the NTK, the phosphorylation of other sites in the linker region on RSK1 is necessary for activation of the NTK <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Dalby et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Gross et al., 2001)</ref>. Of note, by immunocytochemistry, the active endogenous RSK1 (detected FIGuRE 2: Phosphorylation of RSK1 on S221 dissociates it from PKARIα to permit its nuclear translocation. (A, B) Wild-type and S221D mutant, but not the S221A form, of RSK1 translocate to nuclei after EGF treatment as shown by immunocytochemistry (A) and cellular fractionation (B). HeLa cells were transfected to express HA-RSK1 or its mutants. After serum starvation, cells were treated with or without 100 nM EGF for 10 min. The HA-RSK1 localization was monitored with anti-HA antibody (A). In B, the amounts of HA-RSK1 or its mutants in cytosolic fraction (C) or nuclear fraction (N) were analyzed by Western blotting.

(D) Cell-permeable peptide PS, corresponding to the pseudosubstrate region of PKARIα, dissociates wildtype and S221A mutant of RSK1 from their association with PKARIα. Serum-starved HeLa cells were preincubated with or without 2 μM peptide PS for 10 min and then treated with or without EGF for 10 min. PKARIα in the lysates was pulled down with cAMP-agarose, and presence of HA-RSK1 or its mutant was monitored. (E) Peptide PS allows RSK1 S221A to translocate to the nuclei in the presence of EGF. HeLa cells were treated as in D. HA-RSK1 localization was monitored with anti-HA antibody. All data presented are representatives from three independent experiments.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Nuclear localization of RSK1 requires importin-mediated transport</head><p>Because a number of large proteins translocate to the nucleus via importin α/β-mediated transport, we determined whether this mechanism was involved in the nuclear localization of endogenous, active RSK1 in HeLa cells. For this purpose, we used the recently described cell-permeable peptide Bimax1 (sequence, RRRRPRKRPLEWDEEP-PRKRKRLW), which binds with importin α and inhibits nuclear localization of proteins via an importin α/β-mediated pathway <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Kosugi et al., 2008)</ref>. Pretreatment of HeLa cells with Bimax1 for 20 min abrogated the nuclear localization of RSK1 ( <ref type="figure">Figure 3A</ref>). The lack of endogenous RSK1 localization to the nucleus in the presence of Bimax1 was not due to changes in the ability of EGF to phosphorylate RSK1 on its various sites and activate it ( <ref type="figure">Figure 3B</ref>). These data suggested that nuclear localization of RSK1 requires importin α/β-mediated nuclear transport.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RSK1 contains a bipartite nuclear localization sequence</head><p>Importin α/β-mediated transport of proteins requires a nuclear localization sequence (NLS). A close examination of the RSK1 sequence revealed the presence of a 17-residue-long "putative" bipartite NLS (K 316 RHIFYSTIDWNKLYRR 332 ) at the interface of the NTK and linker region on RSK1 ( <ref type="figure">Figure 4A</ref>). Because the basic residues on the N-and C-termini of the bipartite NLS are functionally important, we made substitutions of the N-terminal basic residues K316/R317 with Ala (NM) or the C-terminal basic residues K328/ R331/R332 with Ala (CM), as well as substitutions of all basic residues in both the N-and C-terminals in the "putative" NLS with Ala (NM/CM; <ref type="figure">Figure 4A</ref>). In response to EGF treatment of cells, the phosphorylation of T573, T359/S363, or S380 on the various mutant forms of RSK1 was not altered ( <ref type="figure">Figure 4B</ref>). However, the NM/CM form of RSK1 was not phosphorylated on S221 ( <ref type="figure">Figure 4B</ref>). Consistent with the requirement for S221 phosphorylation being important for activation of RSK1, the NM/CM form of RSK1 that was immunoprecipitated from cells treated with EGF did not exhibit elevation in kinase activity ( <ref type="figure">Figure 4C</ref>). On the other hand, although the NM mutant of RSK1 was phosphorylated on S221, it was devoid of kinase activity ( <ref type="figure">Figure 4C</ref>), suggesting that the substitution of K316/ R317 with Ala in the extreme C-terminus of NTK ( <ref type="figure">Figure 4A</ref>) disrupted the structure of this kinase domain, rendering it inactive. The kinase activity of the CM mutant of RSK1 was enhanced by EGF treatment ( <ref type="figure">Figure 4C</ref>). Another interesting finding in these experiments is the observation that EGF increased phosphorylation of S732 on the NM/CM mutant of RSK1 that is not phosphorylated on S221 and is also not activated by the growth factor ( <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>, B and C). This suggests that phosphorylation of S732 on RSK1 can occur in-trans and, in the case of the NM/CM RSK1, possibly via activation by EGF of the endogenous RSK1.</p><p>Next, by confocal microscopy, we tested the ability of the HAtagged wild-type or mutant forms of RSK1 harboring substitutions by anti-phospho-Thr-573 antibody) is localized mainly in the nucleus, whereas significant amounts of total endogenous or expressed RSK1 are still observed in the cytoplasm after EGF treatment ( <ref type="figure">Figure 1B</ref>, top two rows, and <ref type="figure">Figure 2A</ref>). This is because the amount of active RSK1 is only a fraction of the total RSK1 and its translocation to the nucleus creates a higher concentration in the nucleus than the larger cytoplasmic compartment. Because of this concentration difference, it is difficult to clearly see the cytoplasmic active RSK1 by immunocytochemistry with anti-phospho-T573 antibody. However, by cell fractionation (see <ref type="figure">Figure 6C</ref> later in this paper) and ImageJ analyses (see <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> later in this paper), active endogenous RSK1 is detectable in the cytoplasm.</p><p>Although, at first sight, the data in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, as well as in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>, A-C, suggest that phosphorylation of S221 on RSK1 is necessary for its nuclear localization, we recently showed that S221 phosphorylation or substitution of Ser-221 with Asp on RSK1 also dissociates RSK1 from its interactions with the pseudosubstrate region of PKARIα <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Gao et al., 2010)</ref>. Thus it is possible that phosphorylation of Ser-221 on RSK1 is required to release the enzyme from its interactions with PKARIα in the cytoplasm to then permit its entry into the nucleus. To address this possibility, we took advantage of our previously published findings that a cell-permeable, palmitoylated peptide corresponding to the pseudosubstrate region of PKARIα (peptide PS) dissociates it from RSK1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Gao et al., 2010)</ref>. Essentially, we determined whether the cell permeable peptide PS that interferes with RSK1/ PKARIα interactions dissociates the S221A form of RSK1 from PKARIα and permits its entry into the nucleus. As shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 2D</ref>, preincubation of HeLa cells with peptide PS decreased the association of RSK1 with both wild-type and S221A forms of RSK1. Moreover, whereas EGF treatment of cells did not result in nuclear localization of S221A RSK1, pretreatment of cells expressing this form of RSK1 with peptide PS permitted its nuclear localization upon EGF addition ( <ref type="figure">Figure 2E)</ref>. Collectively, the data in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> demonstrate that phos-FIGuRE 3: Nuclear translocation of RSK1 requires importin-mediated transport.

The findings in <ref type="figure">Figure 4D</ref> were also confirmed by monitoring the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions of HeLa cells expressing either the wild-type or the NLS mutant forms of RSK1 ( <ref type="figure">Figure 4E</ref>). The inability of the CM mutant of RSK1 to localize to the nucleus in response to EGF is not due to the lack of either its kinase activity or its phosphorylation on S221 ( <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>, B and C), strongly suggesting that neither the phosphorylation of S221 nor kinase activity of RSK1 by itself is sufficient for nuclear localization. Moreover, these data ( <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>, D and E) strongly suggest that residues K328/R331/R332 form part of the NLS on RSK1.</p></div>

Therefore we asked whether, once localized to the nucleus, RSK1 requires its indirect interactions with AKAPs to be retained in the nucleus. To address this question, we first treated HeLa cells with EGF for 10 min and then added stearated-Ht31, a cellpermeable peptide that disrupts the interactions of PKA regulatory subunits with AKAPs <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Carr et al., 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Vijayaraghavan et al., 1997)</ref>. At different times thereafter, we examined the localization of the endogenous active RSK1 in HeLa cells. As shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 5A</ref> (right panel), EGF treatment resulted in the nuclear localization of RSK1 over the time span (20 min) of the experiment. However, when Ht31 was added after pretreatment with EGF, the amount of the nuclear RSK1 decreased over time, such that 5 min after Ht31 addition, the amount of active RSK1 in the cytoplasm was markedly increased. These data ( <ref type="figure">Figure 5A</ref>) show that the retention of the active RSK1 in the nucleus requires its association in a complex with AKAP(s). Of interest, exposure of HeLa cells to the nuclear export inhibitor leptomycin B (LMB) abolished the Ht31-mediated decrease in nuclear accumulation of active RSK1 ( <ref type="figure">Figure 5B</ref>), suggesting that RSK1 may also contain a nuclear export sequence (see Discussion). The data in <ref type="figure">Figure 5B</ref> also confirm that the loss of active RSK1 in the nucleus after Ht31 treatment was due to efflux of RSK1 from the nucleus.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>AKAP95 retains RSK1 in the nucleus</head><p>To identify the AKAP(s) that retain active RSK1 in the nucleus, we treated B82L cells with cell-permeable, stearated Ht31 or control Ht31P that does not dissociate PKA regulatory subunits from AKAPs <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Carr et al., 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Vijayaraghavan et al., 1997)</ref> for 20 min and then treated cells with EGF for 10 min. Following immunoprecipitation of RSK1, we analyzed the associated proteins by SDS-PAGE and gel code blue staining. Ht31 decreased a few protein bands associated with RSK1 (Supplemental <ref type="figure">Figure S1A)</ref>. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometer/mass spectrometer analyses of the ∼100-kDa band in control and Ht31P yielded peptides corresponding to several proteins, including AKAP95 (Supplemental <ref type="figure">Figure S1B)</ref>. AKAP95 was shown to be a nuclear protein <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Coghlan et al., 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Eide et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Akileswaran et al., 2001</ref>). Therefore we investigated whether RSK1 and AKAP95 existed in the same complex. As shown in <ref type="figure">Figure  6A</ref>, immunoprecipitation of AKAP95 from HeLa cells treated with EGF resulted in the coimmunoprecipitation of RSK1. In controls with NIH3T3 cells that do not express endogenous RSK1 but do express RSK2 and RSK3 (Supplemental <ref type="figure">Figure S2</ref>), this interaction was not observed ( <ref type="figure">Figure 6A</ref>). Of note, silencing of AKAP95 did not alter the ability of EGF to activate RSK1 in HeLa cells ( <ref type="figure">Figure 6B</ref>). Moreover, as assessed by cell fractionation and fluorescence microscopy, silencing of AKAP95 in HeLa cells, respectively, resulted in a decrease in the nuclear content of active RSK1 and increase in its cytosolic amounts ( <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>, C and D). Similar results (not shown) were also found in B82L mouse lung fibroblasts, in which RSK1 interacts with PKA subunits as shown here with HeLa cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Chaturvedi et al., 2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Chaturvedi et al., , 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Gao et al., 2010)</ref>. Thus the inability of phospho-RSK1 to localize to the nucleus is not due to altered RSK1 activation. Together these data suggest that AKAP95 is one of the AKAPs that retain active RSK1 in the nucleus.</p><p>To further confirm the notion that AKAP95 retains active RSK1 in the nucleus, we expressed either the green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged wild-type AKAP95 or its mutant forms that contain substitutions of one (1M; R290S), two (2M; K304S/R305S), or three (3M; R290S/K304S/R305S) residues in its NLS and, therefore, do not affect (1M), attenuate (2M), or abolish (3M) the nuclear localization of AKAP95 <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Kamada et al., 2005)</ref>. Consistent with the original report with these forms of AKAP95 <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Kamada et al., 2005)</ref>, as monitored by immunocytochemistry in HEK293 cells, the wild-type and 1M forms were mainly nuclear, the 2M form was distributed in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, and the 3M mutant was cytoplasmic (Supplemental <ref type="figure">Figure S3, A-D)</ref>. In addition, after expressing wildtype and mutant forms of GFP-AKAP95 in HEK 293 cells and treating them with EGF, we determined by cell fractionation studies the localization of the endogenous RSK1 in the nucleus and cytosolic fractions of the cells. As shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 7A</ref>, in the presence of EGF, more phospho-RSK1 was present in the nuclear fractions than in the cytosolic fractions from cells transfected with the wild-type and 1M mutant forms of AKAP95. The distribution of phospho-RSK1 was approximately similar in the cytosolic and nuclear fractions from cells transfected with GFP-AKAP95 2M and mostly cytosolic in cells expressing GFP-AKAP95 3M ( <ref type="figure">Figure 7A</ref>). Similarly, in HeLa cells, the expressed wild-type GFP-AKAP95 was localized to the nucleus together with active (phospo-380) RSK1, whereas expression of the 3M mutant of GFP-AKAP95 resulted in colocalization of the active RSK1 with the 3M mutant in the cytoplasm ( <ref type="figure">Figure 7B</ref>). These findings were also corroborated by immunolocalization of the wild-type AKAP95 or its 3M mutant and RSK1 ( <ref type="figure">Figure 7C</ref>). Of note, mutations of the NLS in AKAP95 did not alter its ability to be coimmunoprecipitated with RSK1 (Supplemental <ref type="figure">Figure S3E)</ref>. Together, the data in <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref> demonstrate that active RSK1 interacts with AKAP95 in cells and the 3M mutant of AKAP95, which cannot be localized to the nucleus, sequesters active RSK1 in the cytoplasm. In this latter respect, the overexpressed 3M mutant of AKAP95 acts as a "trap" for RSK1 and precludes its localization into the nucleus.</p><p>Nuclear localization of RSK1 is required for stimulation of DNA synthesis Because RSK1 was shown to play an important role in cell proliferation by promoting G1 → S progression <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Fujita et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Cargnello and Roux, 2011)</ref>, using two different approaches we investigated whether its translocation to the nucleus is important to initiate DNA synthesis. In the first approach, we investigated whether the nuclear function of the CM mutant form of RSK1 that is activated by EGF but does not localize to the nucleus <ref type="figure">(Figure 4)</ref> is different from its wild-type counterpart. For this purpose, we monitored bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation in NIH3T3 cells, which express RSK2 and RSK3 but do not express any detectable amounts of endogenous RSK1 (Supplemental <ref type="figure">Figure S2)</ref>. To FIGuRE 5: Retention of active RSK1 in the nucleus requires its indirect (via PKA) interactions with AKAPs. (A) Ht31 decreases the nuclear retention of active RSK1 in the nucleus.

As shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 8A</ref>, in NIH3T3 cells, EGF activated both the wild-type and CM forms of RSK1 to similar FIGuRE 7: Overexpression of wild-type and NLS mutant forms of GFP-AKAP95 alter the cellular localization of endogenous RSK1.

Data shown are representative of three independent experiments. extents. However, the wild-type RSK1 enhanced BrdU incorporation, but the CM mutant did not ( <ref type="figure">Figure 8B</ref>). As a second approach, we expressed either wild-type or 3M mutant of AKAP95 in HeLa cells to determine whether permitting (with wild-type AKAP95) or restricting (with 3M-AKAP95) the nuclear localization of endogenous RSK1 altered BrdU incorporation into cells. Whereas the expression of wild-type AKAP95 did not alter BrdU incorporation, the 3M mutant of AKAP95, which sequesters active RSK1 in the cytoplasm, decreased BrdU incorporation ( <ref type="figure">Figure 8C</ref>). These data demonstrate that disruption of the nuclear localization of active RSK1 by either mutation of its NLS or "trapping" of endogenous RSK1 in the cytoplasm by the nuclear localization-deficient 3M mutant of AKAP95 attenuates the nuclear functions of RSK1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>Besides elucidating how active RSK1 is localized and retained in the nucleus, we unraveled some additional salient features concerning how this enzyme is regulated. First, as previously suggested <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Gao et al., 2010)</ref>, although the phosphorylation of Ser-221 is necessary for nuclear localization of RSK1, we demonstrated that this phos-phorylation is required to dissociate the active RSK1 from PKARIα in the cytoplasm. Hence the S221A mutant of RSK1, which does not localize to the nucleus upon EGF treatment of cells, can localize to the nucleus if its interaction with PKARIα is disrupted by low concentrations of a cell-permeable peptide (peptide PS) corresponding to the pseudosubstrate region of PKARIα, the inactive RSK1-binding site <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Gao et al., 2010)</ref>. At the low concentrations of peptide PS used in this study, PKAc and PKARIα interactions are not affected <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Gao et al., 2010)</ref>. Because the S221A mutant of RSK1 is not active, our findings with peptide PS also demonstrate that the inactive RSK1 can enter the nucleus. However, because nuclear localization of the S221A mutant of RSK1 is EGF dependent, our findings suggest that the other sites on RSK1 have to be phosphorylated for its nuclear entry. Overall, therefore, although phosphorylation of S221 is required to release RSK1 from PKARIα and permit its nuclear localization, the activity of the NTK is not necessary for its nuclear translocation. Second, supporting the notion that phosphorylation of sites in the linker region of RSK1 are necessary for its activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Dalby et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Gross et al., 2001)</ref>, we showed that the S221D mutant of RSK1 also requires EGF for activation of the NTK and that a negative 2007), are important for activity, and their substitution perhaps alters the conformation of the NTK to abrogate its activity.</p><p>We also demonstrated that RSK1 contains a bipartite NLS, and substitution of basic residues in its N-or C-terminus abrogates its translocation to the nucleus after EGF addition. Because substitution of both the Nterminal (K316/R317) and C-terminal (K328/ R331/R332) basic residues in the NLS with Ala (RSK1-NM/CM) also disrupts its phosphorylation on S221, this form of RSK1 most likely does not translocate to the nucleus because it cannot dissociate from PKARIα. However, substitutions of basic residues in only the N-terminal (K316/R317, RSK1-NM) or C-terminal (K328/R331/R332, RSK1-CM) regions of the NLS that permit the phosphorylation of S221 on these mutant forms also do not translocate to the nucleus irrespective of whether the activity of the NTK can be augmented by EGF (RSK1-CM) or not (RSK1-NM). These findings, coupled with the observations that phosphorylation of S221 or a negative charge at this position, but not the activity of the NTK, is required for nuclear translocation of RSK1 demonstrate that the 17-residue-long region comprising K316-R332 is the NLS. This region is encompassed by the αI-αJ loop as well as the αJ helix at the surface of the large helical lobe of the NTK <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Ikuta et al., 2007)</ref> and is conserved in RSK1 in different species such as mouse, rat, and human. In addition, cognate regions comprising residues K313-K329 and K322-R338 on RSK2 and RSK3, respectively, also have significant similarity to the NLS on RSK1. Thus it is possible that these regions on RSK2 and RSK3 are also their respective NLSs. However, in one study, the expression of the N-terminal half of RSK2, which included residues K313-K329, did not localize to the nucleus, and that study suggested that the C-terminal half of RSK2 is important for its nuclear localization <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Eisinger-Mathason et al., 2008)</ref>, raising the possibility that the NLS containing K313-329 is functional in the context of the full-length RSK2 when the autophosphorylation sites on the linker region are phosphorylated.</p><p>We previously showed that the active RSK1 via its extreme C-terminal 13 residues, which include Ser-732, associates with PKAc, and this interaction requires the phosphorylation of Ser-732 <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Gao and Patel, 2009)</ref>. This interaction permits the indirect (via the regulatory subunit of PKA) association of the active RSK1 with AKAPs, and disruption of the RSK/PKA complex from AKAPs results in decreased nuclear localization of RSK1. The decreased nuclear localization could result from either export of the RSK1 from the nucleus or the lack of RSK1 entry into the nucleus. Here we showed that charge at this position by itself is not sufficient to activate the enzyme. A third interesting aspect is that the substitution of K316/ R317 with Ala abrogated the activity of the NTK without altering its phosphorylation on Ser-221. Thus these two basic residues in the extreme C-terminus of the NTK, which lie on its surface (Ikuta et al., FIGuRE 8: Nuclear translocation of RSK1 is required to stimulate DNA synthesis. (A) HA-RSK1 and its CM mutant form demonstrate similar kinase activities. NIH3T3 cells were transfected to express HA-RSK1 or its CM mutant. After serum starvation, cells were treated with or without 100 nM EGF for 10 min. HA-RSK1 and HA-RSK1 CM were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody, and the IP complex was subjected to the in vitro kinase assays. The amounts of HA-RSK1 in the IP were monitored with Western blotting (bottom). Data are mean ± SE (n = 3 independent experiments). (B) HA-RSK1, but not its CM mutant, stimulate BrdU incorporation. NIH3T3 cells were transfected to express HA-RSK1 or HA-RSK1 CM. After serum starvation, cells were incubated with 10% serum/DMEM for 18 h, followed by the addition of BrdU for 4 h. (C) Overexpression of GFP-AKAP95 3M, but not wild-type GFP-AKAP95, decreases BrdU incorporation in HeLa cells. After transfection to express wild-type GFP-AKAP95 or its 3M mutant in HeLa cells, experiments were performed as in B. The quantified data in B and C reflect the number of BrdU-positive cells as a ratio of the total number of cells that expressed the different transfected constructs. The BrdU-positive staining in untransfected cells within the same fields provided the control ratios. The data are mean ± SE from at least 102 cells from four separate experiments (B) and at least 181 cells from three experiments (C). Statistical significance was determined by Student's t test analyses. Scale bar, 10 μm.</p><p>is exported out of the nucleus while it is still attached to PKAc and the regulatory subunit of PKA <ref type="figure">(Figure 9</ref>). Because leptomycin B blocked the Ht31-mediated efflux of RSK1 from the nucleus ( <ref type="figure">Figure 5B</ref>), it is possible that RSK1 contains a nuclear export signal. However, a nuclear export signal for RSK1 has not been identified. From its primary structure, it appears that residues Leu-173 to Ser-180 on RSK1 qualify as a putative nuclear export sequence. These residues in the αE helix are adjacent to the NLS on the surface of the large helical loop of the NTK on RSK1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Ikuta et al., 2007)</ref>. Because substitutions of K316 and R317 that are adjacent to the putative nuclear export signal (L173-S180) on the surface of the NTK disrupt its activity, we have not endeavored to mutate the putative RSK1 nuclear export signal.</p><p>In NIH3T3 cells, which do not express appreciable amounts of RSK1, expression of wild-type RSK1, but not its NLS-deficient CM mutant, increased DNA synthesis as monitored by BrdU staining. These data are consistent with the role of RSK1 as a promoter of cell proliferation <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Smith et al., 2005)</ref> and also demonstrate that the NLS mutant of RSK1 loses its nuclear function. Similarly, overexpression of GFP-AKAP 3M, which traps endogenous RSK1 in the cytoplasm, also diminished incorporation of BrdU, further demonstrating the necessity for nuclear RSK1 in this process. Overall, our findings demonstrate that RSK1 contains an NLS (K316-R332) that is necessary for its import into the nucleus and that phosphorylation of Ser-221 in the NTK is required to dissociate it from PKARIα/AKAP complex in the cytoplasm. The activation of the NTK is not necessary for nuclear translocation of RSK1, and besides S221, other phospho sites on RSK1 are also important for both its activity and nuclear import. Once inside the nucleus, RSK1 requires indirect (via PKA) interactions with AKAP95 to be retained in the nucleus. Moreover, mutations of the NLS on RSK1 that do not affect its kinase activity but interfere with its nuclear localization or trapping of RSK1 in the cytoplasm by an NLS-deficient mutant of AKAP95 diminishes BrdU incorporation in cells.</p></div>

Anti-HA-horseradish peroxidase was from Roche Applied Science (Indianapolis, IN), and the anti-HA polyclonal antibody was from Covance (Berkeley, CA). Anti-BrdU was from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). N-terminally palmitoylated PKARIα peptide (PS), corresponding to PKARIα pseudosubstrate region (amino acids 91-99), was synthesized by New England Peptide (Gardner, MA). N-terminally once the active RSK1 is in the nucleus, the addition of Ht31, which disrupts PKA interactions with AKAPs, results in a time-dependent export of the active RSK1 from the nucleus. Hence the interaction of active RSK1 with PKAc and, therefore, AKAP(s) is necessary for its retention in the nucleus. The need for RSK1 interactions with PKA subunits and AKAP(s) for nuclear retention is akin to the nuclear retention of RSK2 via its interactions with TIA-1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Eisinger-Mathason et al., 2008)</ref>.</p><p>Our studies also identified AKAP95 as one of the AKAPs that is necessary for the retention of RSK1 in the nucleus. Of interest, AKAP95 associates with the RII subunits of PKA <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Herberg et al., 2000)</ref>. Previously, we demonstrated that the inactive RSK1 interacts with RI but not RII subunits (unpublished data). However, since the active RSK1 interacts with PKAc, it is possible that in the nucleus the RSK1, via PKAc and PKARII, is tethered to AKAP95 (see schematic in <ref type="figure">Figure  9</ref>). This would be consistent with the notion that PKARIα is cytosolic in its localization whereas nuclear PKARII is responsible for association of PKAc with nuclear AKAPs <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Day et al., 2011)</ref>. Also interesting are the previous findings that AKAP95 is important in G1 → S phase transition and is associated with proteins that regulate this process <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Arsenijevic et al., 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Arsenijevic et al., , 2006</ref>. In addition, AKAP95 is involved in chromosome condensation at mitosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Collas et al., 1999)</ref>.

Inactive RSK1 is associated with PKARIα (RI) in the cytoplasm. Activation of RSK1 dissociates it from PKARIα and permits its entry into the nucleus, where, via interactions with catalytic subunit of PKA (PKAc) and AKAP95, it is retained in the nucleus. Disruption of the PKA/AKAP95 interactions with Ht31 result in decreased RSK1 retention in the nucleus, an event that is LMB sensitive.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pulldown of PKARIα with cAMP-agarose</head><p>Serum-starved HeLa cells were preincubated with or without 2 μM PKARIα peptide PS for 10 min and then treated with or without EGF for 10 min. Cleared cell lysates (500 μg of protein) were mixed with cAMP-agarose (Sigma-Aldrich) for 2 h at 4°C. The beads were then washed twice with high-salt buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM KCl, 0.5 M NaCl, 0.1% Igepal CA-630, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and proteinase inhibitor mixture) followed by two washes with no-salt buffer (same as high-salt buffer but without NaCl). Proteins in the complex were resuspended in Laemmli buffer and subjected to Western analyses using anti-PKARIα and anti-HA horseradish peroxidase.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>In vitro kinase activity assays</head><p>The assays were performed as described previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Gao et al., 2010)</ref>. Essentially, HeLa cells were transfected to express HA-RSK1 or its mutants. After overnight serum starvation, cells were treated with or without 100 nM EGF for 10 min. HA-RSK1 or its mutants were immunoprecipitated as described, and then the immunoprecipitate (IP) complex was resuspended in 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.1% mercaptoethanol, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 1 mM NaF, 25 mM glycerophosphate, and 5 mM MgSO4. The reaction was started with addition of 200 μM Kemptide, 125 μM ATP, and 2.5 μCi of [γ-32 P]ATP and stopped after 15 min of incubation at room temperature. One parallel set of IP complex was resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer for Western blotting to monitor the amounts of HA-RSK1 or its mutants in the complex.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Immunocytochemistry</head><p>HeLa cells were plated in eight-chamber slides at 10,000 cells/well. After serum starvation, cells underwent different treatments as indicated in the figure legends. After fixation with 4% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 10 min, cells were permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min, followed by 1 h of blocking with 5% bovine serum albumin in PBS. Cells were stained with primary antibodies, rabbit anti-RSK1, rabbit anti-phospho-T573 RSK, rabbit anti-AKAP95, or mouse anti-HA antibody overnight at 4°C. Fluorescence staining was performed using Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibody (green) or Alexa 594-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (red). Confocal microscopy was performed using a multiphoton Zeiss LSM-510 laser scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) equipped with a C-Apo 40×/1.2 water lens. Confocal images were acquired with LSM 510 software. Nonconfocal images were acquired with an Olympus IX81 microscope (Olympus, Center Valley, PA) equipped with 40×/0.60 lens and Retiga EXi digital camera (QImaging, Surrey, Canada). For quantification, the fluorescence densities in the nucleus or cytoplasm were analyzed with ImageJ (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cell fractionation</head><p>Cells were homogenized after incubation in hypotonic buffer from the nuclear extraction kit (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA) on ice for 15 min. The cell homogenates were centrifuged at 200 × g to remove intact cells and cell debris. The supernatant was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min to pellet cell nuclei. The nuclear pellet was washed and centrifuged again. The 1000 × g supernatants were then centrifuged at 100,000 × g to generate the cytosolic fraction. The proteins in nuclear and cytosolic fractions were subjected to Western analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Brdu incorporation</head><p>NIH3T3 cells were plated in eight-chamber slides at 10,000 cells/ well. Cells were transfected with plasmids expressing HA-RSK1 or its mutant using Metafectene Pro transfection reagent (Biontex Laboratories GmbH, Martinsried, Germany). Similarly, HeLa cells were transfected with GFP-AKAP95 or its 3M mutant, which does not localize inside the nucleus, using TransIT-HeLaMONSTER Transfection Kit. One day after transfection, cells were serum starved for 24 h and then replaced with DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum for 18 h, followed by addition of 10 μM BrdU and 4 h of incubation. The cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde/PBS for 10 min at room temperature and then were permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100/ PBS for 10 min. To denature DNA, cells were incubated with 2 N HCl at room temperature for 30 min. After extensive washes with PBS and 5% bovine serum albumin/PBS blocking, cells were incubated with anti-BrdU antibody (mouse monoclonal) and anti-HA antibody (rabbit polyclonal) at 4°C overnight. The secondary antibodies were Alexa 594-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody or Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody. The images were obtained by a multiphoton Zeiss LSM-510 laser-scanning microscope as described. The results are expressed as the percentage of cells showing nuclear staining with BrdU.</p></div>		</body>
