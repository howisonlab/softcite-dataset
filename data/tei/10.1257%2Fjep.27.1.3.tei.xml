They have two fi ve-year averages on 31 countries for the period 1981-1990. They fi nd support for the idea that higher patent protection leads to higher research and development spending as a fraction of GDP. However, a different story seems equally plausible. Countries with a larger market can more easily pay the fi xed costs of innovation. Indeed, one perspective is that their data essentially compares countries with relatively small economies, little intellectual property protection, and low R&amp;D spending with countries with relatively larger economies, greater intellectual property protection, and higher R&amp;D spending. For example, R&amp;D spending as a fraction of GDP in their data ranges from a ten-year average of 0.2 percent in Jordan to 2.8 percent in Sweden. If we combine their data with GDP data from The 1990 CIA World Fact Book to take account of the size of the economy, increasing the strength of intellectual property protection from 0 to 1 to 2 on their fi ve-point scale does increase R&amp;D expenditure. But as intellectual property protection is increased further, the gains to R&amp;D expenditure levels then falls. Even at the lower levels, we are probably observing primarily the effect of foreign direct investment: that is, among poor countries with near-zero intellectual property protection, increases bring in more foreign investment and in doing so directly raise R&amp;D spending. In higher-income countries with larger economies, foreign investment is not an issue, and increases in intellectual property have little or no effect on innovation.</p><p>The <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Lerner (2002)</ref> study is especially notable because he examined all signifi -The <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Lerner (2002)</ref> study is especially notable because he examined all significant changes in patent law in all countries over the last 150 years.

In other words, they fi nd that the maximum innovative effort (as measured by patents) occurs at some "intermediate" position between a high and low level of competition. However, Hashmi (2011) reexamines the inverted-U relationship using data from publicly traded US manufacturing fi rms and fi nds a robust positive relationship between the inverse of markups and citation-weighted patents. Correa (2012) reexamines the same dataset of UK fi rms and shows that the prediction of an inverted-U is overturned when allowing for the possibility that innovations follow a "memory process," where the current probability of introducing a new innovation increases when a fi rm successfully innovated in the previous period. He also fi nds a structural break in the data in 1981, when the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit was established to hear appeals of patent cases. Overall, Correa fi nds a positive innovation-competition relationship for the memory industries before the 1982 reform, but no relationship between innovation and competition for those industries that he classifi es as memory-less. has greatly increased in recent decades because modern products are made up has greatly increased in recent decades because modern products are made up of so many different components.

Either way, the user must identify itself when the purchase is made. Those obvious steps are exactly what Amazon describes in its patent, albeit with a few fl ow charts thrown into the eleven-page patent application. But through the fog of those fl ow charts, it is relatively easy to see that the verbal description of the single-click procedure applies equally well to what happens on the Amazon site and to what happens in front of millions of vending machines every day. The Amazon patent was reexamined by the US Patent Offi ce starting in May 2006. After a preliminary fi nding that, indeed, "obvious" means "obvious" even at the Patent Offi ce, the offi ce then reversed itself and in October 2007, reaffi rmed the Amazon patent, albeit limiting its scope slightly.

Economists fought for decades-ultimately with considerable success-to reduce restrictions on fought for decades-ultimately with considerable success-to reduce restrictions on international trade. A similar approach, albeit less slow, should be adopted to phase international trade. A similar approach, albeit less slow, should be adopted to phase out patents. Because policy proposals are often better digested and metabolized in out patents. Because policy proposals are often better digested and metabolized in small bites, here is our list of small reforms that could be easily implemented. small bites, here is our list of small reforms that could be easily implemented. 1) Patents are time limited, which makes it relatively easy to phase them out by phasing in ever shorter patent durations. This conservative approach also has the advantage that if reducing patent terms indeed has a measurable effect on innovation, the process can be reversed. 2) Stop the rising tide that, since the early 1980s, has extended the set of what can be patented and has shifted the legal and judicial balance substantially in favor of patent holders. 3) Because competition fosters productivity growth, antitrust and competition policies should seek to limit patents when they are hindering innovation. This policy may be of particular relevance for high-tech sectors, from software to bioengineering, to medical products and pharmaceuticals. 4) Current international trade negotiations that affect patents often occur as part of either the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), which was signed in 1995 as part of the World Trade Organization negotiations, or as part of the World Intellectual Property Organization, an agency of the United Nations. The nature of these agreements and organizations is well indicated by the use of the propaganda term "intellectual property" in their titles. In both cases, these talks are often focused on how to prevent ideas from high-income countries from being used in low-income countries-what we would characterize as essentially a neomercantilist approach toward free trade in goods and ideas. We should be highly cautious about this agenda. Within a couple of decades, the "balance of trade in ideas" between the US and European economies and emerging economies in Asia might easily equalize or reverse. Engaging in "mercantilism of ideas" may seem favorable to certain large US fi rms now, but such rules may become costly to the US economy if they are applied to protect patents held in the future by producers in the now-developing Asian economies. 5) If the US economy is to have patents, we may want to start tailoring their length and breadth to different sectoral needs. Substantial empirical work needs to be done to implement this properly, although a vast legal literature is already pointing in this direction. 6) Patents should not be granted based only on technological insights, but should also take economic evidence into account. For example, if an invention is easy to copy or has a high fi xed cost, then patent protection to provide an incentive for the inventor may be more suitable. Ultimately, patents should be awarded only when strictly needed on economic grounds, as spelled out earlier. 7) We advocate returning to the rule prior to the Bayh-Dole Act of 1980 according to which the results of federally subsidized research cannot lead to patents, but should be available to all market participants. This reform would be particularly useful for encouraging the dissemination of innovation and heightening competition in the pharmaceutical industry. 8) In several industries, notably pharmaceuticals, it would be useful to rethink all of the government policies that bear on incentives for invention. The broad point is that there are a number of ways to reduce the risks and cost of developing new drugs, rather than just trying to ratchet up patent protection.</p><p>In general, public policy should aim to decrease patent monopolies gradually but surely, and the ultimate goal should be the abolition of patents. After six decades of further study since Machlup's testimony in 1958 has failed to fi nd evidence that patents promote the common good, it is surely time to reassess his conclusion that it would be irresponsible to abolish the patent system. The patent system arose as a way to limit the power of royalty to award monopolies to favored individuals; but now its primary effect is to encourage large but stagnant incumbent fi rms to block innovation and inhibit competition.</p><p>■ We are grateful to the editors, the referees, and to Richard Stallman for a careful reading and comments.</p></div>			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="3">A more subtle point is that secrecy may bias the type of inventive activity away from innovations that are not easily kept secret to those that can be.
