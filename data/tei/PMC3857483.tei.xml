<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>The epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), whereby epithelial cells become individual mesenchymal cells, is a common feature of embryonic development <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Nieto, 2011)</ref> and is reiterated during tumor metastasis in adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Thiery et al., 2009)</ref>. During this process, profound changes occur in cell morphology such that tightly adherent and polarized epithelial cells are transformed into loosely organized, nonpolarized, and often migratory mesenchymal cells. The cell biological processes underlying EMT have been best studied in cancer cells grown in vitro, and several transcription factors, including Snail, Twist, and Sip1/Zeb2/ZFHX1B (here referred to as Sip1), have been identified as important mediators of EMT in metastasis <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Kang and Massagué, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Thiery et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Kerosuo and Bronner-Fraser, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>The neural crest (NC) provides a good model system for studying the molecular mechanisms underlying EMT in a nonmalignant environment. Neural crest progenitors first express definitive specification markers, including EMT genes like Snail2, in the dorsal midline of the neural tube before initiating emigration in amniotes <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Nieto et al., 1994)</ref>. Shortly thereafter, NC cells commence EMT and subsequently migrate to distant sites where they differentiate into numerous derivatives. Despite the similarities in morphology and gene expression between embryonic and cancer cells undergoing EMT, little is known about the functional conservation of the underlying molecular pathways.</p><p>During the process of neural crest EMT, the expression and cellular localization of adhesion molecules such as cadherin 6B (Cad6B) and neural cadherin (Ncad) are highly regulated <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Kerosuo and Bronner-Fraser, 2012)</ref>. Ncad is expressed throughout the apical portion of the neuroepithelium <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Akitaya and Bronner-Fraser, 1992)</ref> but is down-regulated in trunk dorsal neural tube cells by the NC specifier gene FoxD3, allowing EMT to occur <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Cheung et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Dady et al., 2012)</ref>. In cancer cells, the process of EMT is highly regulated by a switch between the expression of epithelial cadherin (Ecad) and Ncad, which is up-regulated in migratory mesenchymal cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Kuphal and Bosserhoff, 2006)</ref> and is a common marker of the mesenchymal phenotype <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Theveneau et al., 2010)</ref>. Intriguingly, expression of Ecad recently has been reported in the neural tube and early emigrating NC cells in developing embryos, suggesting that it may play a previously unrecognized role in neural T he neural crest, an embryonic stem cell population, initially resides within the dorsal neural tube but subsequently undergoes an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) to commence migration. Although neural crest and cancer EMTs are morphologically similar, little is known regarding conservation of their underlying molecular mechanisms. We report that Sip1, which is involved in cancer EMT, plays a critical role in promoting the neural crest cell transition to a mesenchymal state. Sip1 transcripts are expressed in premigratory/migrating crest cells. After Sip1 loss, the neural crest specifier gene FoxD3 was abnormally retained in the dorsal neuroepithelium, whereas Sox10, which is normally required for emigration, was diminished. Subsequently, clumps of adherent neural crest cells remained adjacent to the neural tube and aberrantly expressed E-cadherin while lacking N-cadherin. These findings demonstrate two distinct phases of neural crest EMT, detachment and mesenchymalization, with the latter involving a novel requirement for Sip1 in regulation of cadherin expression during completion of neural crest EMT.</p><p>To determine the spatiotemporal pattern of Sip1 expression during early chick development, we performed whole-mount in situ hybridization. Sip1 transcripts are barely detectable in the presumptive neural plate at Hamburger Hamilton stage 4 (HH4; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1 A)</ref> but become strongly expressed in this region by HH5 ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1 B)</ref>. As neurulation begins, Sip1 is expressed throughout the neural plate at HH7 <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 1, C and c)</ref>. Expression increases at HH8 and HH8, just before neural crest EMT <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 1, D</ref> and E). As NC cells begin to emigrate at HH9, Sip1 expression is maintained in the neural tube and also is present in the newly migratory NC cells <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 1, F and f)</ref>. By HH12, Sip1 is observed in the migratory cranial crest and in the rhombomere 4 migratory stream <ref type="bibr">(Fig. 1,</ref><ref type="bibr">G and g;</ref><ref type="bibr">arrow)</ref>, as evidenced by its overlap with the HNK-1 epitope, characteristic of migratory NC cells ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref> g, bottom). Sip1 transcripts are maintained throughout the developing central nervous system and migratory crest at HH12 and HH16 <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 1</ref>, G and H), analogous to Sip1 protein expression ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1 g)</ref>. Taken together, these results show that Sip1 is expressed throughout early stages of NC development.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sip1 is required for the acquisition of mesenchymal morphology and completion of cranial neural crest EMT</head><p>We tested the functional role of Sip1 in NC development by electroporating a translation-blocking morpholino into the neural plate border region of gastrulating (HH4) embryos, corresponding to the onset of endogenous Sip1 expression, and examined subsequent effects on neural crest development at HH8-13, corresponding with the expression of neural crest specifier genes and the end of migration in the cranial regions.</p><p>At HH8, we examined the effects on expression of the early neural crest specifier gene, FoxD3, as well as neural genes, to determine whether the loss of Sip1 affected either neural or neural crest specification. Mulitplex NanoString analysis as well as in situ hybridization at HH8 revealed an early downregulation of FoxD3 expression after Sip1MO loss, but this decrease appeared to be very transient, recovering by HH9 ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. S1, A-D)</ref>. Similarly, the loss of Sip1 had little or no effect on neural specification, except for a slight change in ERNI at HH8 <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. S1</ref>, E-I).</p><p>Because there appeared to be no prolonged effect on specification, we next examined whether the loss of Sip1 might influence neural crest EMT, which begins at HH9, by examining expression of FoxD3 and Sox10. In embryos lacking Sip1, FoxD3 expression was abnormally maintained in the dorsal neural tube <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 2</ref>, A and a; n = 19/33). At stages when NC cells should be undergoing EMT and leaving the neural tube, the loss of Sip1 also resulted in a decrease in Sox10 expression <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 2 B</ref>; n = 25/29), normally required for migration to commence. Demonstrating specificity, we found that co-electroporation of Sip1MO plus mRNA encoding human Zeb2/Sip1 DNA <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Ellis et al., 2010)</ref> could partially rescue the loss of Sox10 expression <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 2 C</ref>; n = 10/21). crest EMT <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Kuphal and Bosserhoff, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Dady et al., 2012)</ref>. At midbrain levels, Snail2 directly represses Cad6B, which is a prerequisite for EMT progression <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Coles et al., 2007)</ref>. Snail2 functions in a complex with the adaptor protein PHD12 to recruit HDAC to the Cad6B promoter <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Strobl-Mazzulla and Bronner, 2012)</ref>. Surprisingly, however, mice that are double mutant for Snail1 and Snail2 in the NC do not have an obvious neural crest phenotype <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Murray et al., 2007)</ref>. This result suggests that at least in mice, other EMT mediators may be able to compensate for the lack of Snail genes.</p><p>One candidate that may compensate for the loss of Snail2 is the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, Twist, which is known to have functional redundancy with Snail2 during mesoderm development in Drosophila and mesoderm and NC induction in Xenopus <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Zhang and Klymkowsky, 2009)</ref>. In frog, Twist physically interacts with Snail1/2 during NC development <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Lander et al., 2013)</ref>. Twist is post-transcriptionally regulated by an F-box protein, Partner of Paired, which also regulates the levels of other EMT factors, suggesting that there is a conserved mechanism regulating the proteins that control the process of EMT <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Lander et al., 2011)</ref>. In addition, Twist has been demonstrated as one of the major factors involved in cancer cell EMT due to its ability to repress the expression of Ecad <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Kang and Massagué, 2004)</ref>. However, Twist is not highly expressed in the premigratory or migrating NC of amniotes <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Bothe et al., 2007)</ref> or lamprey embryos <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Sauka-Spengler et al., 2007)</ref>. Moreover, the NC defects observed in Twist1-null mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Chen et al., 2007)</ref> appear to be secondarily caused by the loss of Twist in the adjacent mesoderm <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Chen and Behringer, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Bildsoe et al., 2013)</ref>. These findings suggest that, in amniotes at least, EMT factors other than Snail and Twist must be playing an important role in the regulation of NC development.</p><p>Another factor implicated in cancer progression and metastasis is Smad-interacting protein 1 (Sip1), which is a two-handed zinc finger transcriptional repressor <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Verschueren et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Brabletz and Brabletz, 2010)</ref>. Sip1 has been postulated to play an important role in the transition of epithelial tumors to metastatic cancers <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Brabletz and Brabletz, 2010)</ref>. Similar to the Snail proteins, Sip1 has been shown to directly bind to and repress Ecad expression in cancer cells, thus facilitating EMT <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Comijn et al., 2001)</ref>. During embryonic development, Sip1 can function downstream of the BMP signaling pathway as a co-regulator with R-Smad proteins and CtBP, or it can function independent of BMP signaling to repress transcription of its targets <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(van Grunsven et al., 2007)</ref>. Although there have been several studies regarding its role in early development <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(van Grunsven et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Sheng et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Nitta et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Delalande et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Lander et al., 2011)</ref>, little is known about the function of Sip1 during neural crest EMT.</p><p>Here, we examine the role of Sip1 in the transition of neuroepithelial cells to mesenchymal NC cells in avian embryos. The data suggest that neural crest EMT is a two-step process in which cells first detach from the neural tube and then subsequently disassociate from each other to become migratory mesenchymal cells. Our data reveal that, while not required for NC cells to exit the neural tube, Sip1 is required for cells to become fully mesenchymal, and that their inability to complete EMT in Sip1's absence appears to involve the dysregulation of the adhesion molecules Ecad and Ncad. Sip1 regulates cadherin switch in neural crest EMT • Rogers et al.</p><p>ContMO-injected side of the same embryo, with the latter appearing to have advanced much farther <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 2</ref>, D and d; n = 9/10). HNK1 staining confirmed that Sip1MO-injected cells were indeed able to delaminate from the neural tube but were unable to progress and migrate; instead, they remained attached to each other and/or to the ectoderm (not depicted). Similar To further explore this phenotype, we examined the expression of Pax7 protein as a nuclear marker for premigratory and early migrating NC cells, and HNK1 as a cell surface marker for migrating NC cells. At HH10, migratory Pax7+ neural crest cells appeared clustered a short distance from the neural tube on the morpholino-injected side compared with the To examine this process in the absence of other cell types, cranial neural tubes that were treated with either ContMO or Sip1MO were dissected from HH8 embryos and cultured on fibronectin-coated tissue culture dishes. Immunostaining with the HNK1 antibody demonstrated that the Sip1MO-electroporated neural crest cells were able to separate from the neural tube tissue <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. 3 G</ref>; n = 8/8; halo of migrating neural crest cells indicated by dotted line) and up-regulate the HNK1 epitope, but unable to individualize and instead remained closely adherent to each other <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. 3</ref>, compare G-g with H-h). In contrast, NC cells from ContMO explants were highly migratory and displayed mesenchymal cell morphology. Similar to the in vivo findings, these results lend further support to the idea that Sip1 is required for NC cells to complete the process of EMT.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Live imaging of the dorsal neural tube after Sip1 knockdown</head><p>To identify the morphological changes that occur in NC cells lacking Sip1 during EMT, we performed live imaging (Videos 1-6). HH4 embryos were electroporated with either FITC-tagged Sip1MO (Video 1) or ContMO (Video 4) along with membranelocalized mem-RFP DNA to better visualize cell shapes and movement. At HH9-10, these embryos were visualized via time-lapse confocal microscopy in order to examine the behavior of cells lacking Sip1 as they exited the neural tube and began migrating. phenotypes were observed for electroporations performed at HH4-HH7 <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. S2, A and B</ref>), though the phenotype was less marked when Sip1 was knocked down at HH7 <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. S2 C)</ref>. Taken together, these data suggest that Sip1-depleted NC cells are able to delaminate from the neural tube but then fail to complete the process of EMT and become mesenchymal cells, as defined by their migratory characteristics.</p><p>Embryos were then analyzed by in situ hybridization at stages of active neural crest migration (HH10) for expression of Sox10 and FoxD3, both of which are expressed in migrating neural crest cells. In contrast to control morpholino (ContMO)injected embryos <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. 3</ref>, A and C) or the uninjected contralateral side, Sip1 morpholino (Sip1MO)-treated embryos had diminished Sox10 expression indicative of a reduction in migrating neural crest cells <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. 3</ref>, B and b; n = 11/13), while aberrantly maintaining expression of FoxD3 in the dorsal neural tube <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. 3</ref>, D and d; n = 7/10). This suggests an important role for Sip1 in progression of the normal neural crest program. To analyze whether this phenotype persists, embryos were allowed to develop until HH13, by which time cranial NC emigration from the neural tube is complete. Even at these late stages, NC cells remained closely adherent to the dorsal neural tube and ectoderm after Sip1 knockdown <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. 3 E</ref>; n = 4/5, arrow). The efficiency of Sip1 protein knockdown by the morpholino was verified by Western blot analysis <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. 3 F)</ref>. neural tube. This is further evident in a transverse section of an HH9 embryo injected on both sides with membrane plus nuclear RFP and on one side with Sip1MO <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Fig. 4, I</ref> and J). Whereas NC cells on the control side are spread out <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Fig. 4</ref>, I and J; left), those on the morpholino-injected side appear stuck together such that it is difficult to distinguish individual cell bodies <ref type="bibr">(Fig. 4,</ref><ref type="bibr">I and J;</ref><ref type="bibr">right,</ref><ref type="bibr">arrows)</ref>. The inability of the Sip1-depleted cells to detach from each other despite their ability to delaminate and exit from the neural tube suggests that the loss of Sip1 may alter NC cell-cell adhesive behavior in a manner that perturbs their mesenchymalization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Loss of Sip1 increases E-cadherin levels in the ectoderm and migratory NC</head><p>Under normal conditions, expression of adhesion molecules is tightly regulated during EMT. Thus, the observation that Sip1MO-electroporated cells failed to disaggregate raised the The results show that Sip1MO-electroporated cells are able to leave the neural tube and migrate laterally but then tend to aggregate near the midline, likely due to increased cell-cell adhesion (Video 2, asterisks). In comparison to control embryos, these cells maintain more of their cell-cell connections, lose directionality, and fail to migrate far (Videos 1-3; n = 5). The cells exhibit a leading edge (LE), but the LE does not move consistently away from the midline as in ContMO-electroporated cells (Videos 4-6), which are able to separate from the midline, separate from each other, and migrate directionally (Video 4 and Video 5; n = 4). Cell tracking indicated that the cells lacking Sip1 travel a short distance and without proper directionality ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 4 C)</ref> when compared with ContMO-injected cells <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Fig. 4 G)</ref>, which migrate linearly and generally laterally away from the embryonic midline. Ultimately, Sip1-depleted NC cells remain adherent to each other (compare Video 3 with Video 6), forming clumps of cells adjacent to the To analyze the effect of Sip1 knockdown on Ecad protein expression, we performed Western blot analysis of heads dissected from embryos that were either injected with ContMO or Sip1MO <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 5 C)</ref>. Consistent with our qPCR results, Ecad protein levels were increased in Sip1MO-injected embryos compared with ContMO embryos. To verify that the Ecad transcript levels were up-regulated in the neural tube, we performed wholemount in situ hybridization using an Ecad probe. Embryos injected with Sip1MO exhibited a strong up-regulation of Ecad expression in the neural tube compared with the contralateral side <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 5 D;</ref> n = 8/10). Next, we performed immunohistochemistry to localize Ecad protein after Sip1MO knockdown. To this end, ContMO was electroporated into the left side of HH4 embryos, concurrent with the electroporation of Sip1MO into the right side of the same embryo. There was a marked up-regulation of Ecad protein expression in both the ectoderm and the migratory possibility that loss of Sip1 may affect expression of one or more adhesion molecule(s). To test this, we quantitated the effects of Sip1 knockdown on various transcripts, including adhesion molecules, known to be involved in NC development, using the NanoString nCounter system <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 5 A)</ref>. The results show that the expression of three adhesion molecules was significantly altered by loss of Sip1 <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 5 A;</ref> n = 3). Whereas Ecad expression was up-regulated in cells lacking Sip1, Ncad and cadherin 7 (Cad7) were down-regulated. To further verify the effect of Sip1 knockdown on the expression of Ecad, we performed quantitative RT-PCR on dissected neural tubes plus adjacent neural crest cells, comparing the Con-tMO-and Sip1MO-injected sides of the same embryos. The results show that the Sip1MO-injected side expressed Ecad at a twofold higher level than the ContMO-injected side <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 5 B</ref>; n = 4, P &lt; 0.036).  migration as analyzed by Snail2 expression <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Fig. 6</ref>, E-e; n = 12/14), Sip1MO + Ncad led to a partial rescue of NC migratory ability, demonstrated by similar numbers and migratory ability of Snail2+ cells on experimental and control sides <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Fig. 6,  F-f)</ref>. However, the addition of exogenous Ncad failed to completely restore the mesenchymal morphology of NC cells, and the Snail2+ migratory NC cells remained clumped together on the injected but not the uninjected side <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Fig. 6, f and f</ref>; n = 10/14). Co-expression of Ncad appears to decrease the levels of Ecad protein in the Sip1MO-injected cells, thus partially restoring normal Ecad protein levels in the premigratory cells <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Fig. 6, G and H</ref>; n = 8/11), perhaps explaining its ability to rescue the phenotype.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Numerous EMT factors have been implicated in cell transformation and metastasis in various types of cancer <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Kang and Massagué, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Thiery et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Kerosuo and Bronner-Fraser, 2012)</ref>. For example, the Sip1/Zeb, Snail, and Twist transcription factor families are highly linked to tumor metastasis <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Sánchez-Tilló et al., 2012)</ref>. However, much less is known about the role of these EMT factors in vivo during embryonic EMTs. Moreover, the same transcription factors appear to have divergent functions in different vertebrates, highlighting the need for better clarification of the molecular pathways driving developmental EMT.</p><p>During embryogenesis, Sip1 functions at multiple time points and in varied processes that are seemingly unrelated to EMT. The N terminus zinc-finger domain is required for neural induction in frog embryos <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Eisaki et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">van Grunsven et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Sheng et al., 2003)</ref>, whereas the C terminus zinc finger domain is required for repression of Xenopus brachyury (Xbra/ Tbx6) to maintain the separation of neural and mesodermal tissues <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Sheng et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Nitta et al., 2007)</ref>. Sip1 is also required for normal anterior-posterior patterning in zebrafish <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Delalande et al., 2008)</ref>. It has also been linked to the regulation of adhesion molecules during EMT in the heart, and appears to be regulated by olfactomedin-1 for cell invasion <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Lencinas et al., 2013)</ref>. At later stages, dysregulated Sip1 has been associated with the vagal neurocristopathies, Mowat-Wilson syndrome and Hirschsprung's disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Wakamatsu et al., 2001</ref>).</p><p>Adding to its developmental functions, the present study shows that Sip1 is required for cranial NC cells to complete the process of EMT. Our results also highlight that there are at least two discrete steps required for the process of cranial neural crest EMT: detachment from the neural tube and subsequent separation of NC cells from the epidermis and each other. After loss of Sip1, NC cells are able to complete the first step but not the second. Although they exit the neural tube, they remain rounded and clumped together outside of the neural tube and are unable to detach from each other, preventing the rearrangements that are required to navigate through the ECM. This phenotype is likely due to increased expression of Ecad in the epidermis and migratory NC cells and the concomitant decrease in Ncad in the neural tube and therefore in the migratory crest cells <ref type="figure">(Fig. 7)</ref>. These data suggest that the NC cells on the Sip1MO side compared with the control side of the same embryo <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 5 E</ref>; n = 26/30). Cells lacking Sip1 appeared to maintain expression of Ecad on all surfaces, consistent with the observed increase in cell-cell adhesion and rounded cellular morphology. This phenotype was observed in older embryos as well <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 5 F</ref>; n = 4/5). As late as HH12-13, these cells maintained high levels of Ecad protein and remained connected to one another. In neural tube explants <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 5, G and H)</ref>, ContMO NC cells emigrated out of the neural tube explant and down-regulated Ecad protein in migratory cells that expressed the HNK1 epitope <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 5 g)</ref>. However, cells lacking Sip1 remained close to the neural tube, failed to become mesenchymal <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 5, H and h)</ref>, and maintained Ecad protein expression while expressing HNK1 <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 5 h)</ref>.</p><p>Because of the observed reciprocal relationship between Sip1 and Ecad, we predicted that simultaneous knockdown of both Sip1 and Ecad might rescue the phenotype. To test this possibility, we co-electroporated Sip1MO while blocking Ecad function via a dominant-negative form of human Ecad that lacks the -catenin binding domain (Ecad-cat) <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Gottardi et al., 2001</ref>). Embryos were injected with (1) ContMO on the left side and Sip1MO on the right side <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 5 I)</ref> or (2) Sip1MO + Ecadcat on the right side <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 5 J)</ref>. The resultant phenotypes were characterized using antibodies against Pax7 <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 5, I</ref> and J) and Snail2 (not depicted), which are expressed in the nuclei of premigratory and migrating cranial NC cells. As expected, Sip1 knockdown resulted in a failure of NC cells to move far from the neural tube <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 5, I</ref> and i; n = 13/17, right side) when compared with the ContMO-injected side. In contrast, co-electroporation of Sip1MO + Ecad-cat was able to partially rescue the Sip1MO phenotype <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 5</ref>, J and j; n = 10/13), with the Pax7-positive migratory cells emigrating earlier and farther from the neural tube. These findings support an epistatic relationship between Sip1 and Ecad.</p></div>

Interestingly, we observed a significant decrease in Ncad transcript and protein expression in the dorsal neural tube after Sip1 knockdown. This reduction was confirmed by qPCR <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Fig. 6 A;</ref> n = 4, P = 0.046), Western blot analysis <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Fig. 6 B)</ref>, whole-mount in situ hybridization <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Fig. 6 C,  inset</ref>; n = 16/19) and immunohistochemistry <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Fig. 6 D;</ref> n = 21/23). Each assay revealed a decrease in Ncad expression on the Sip1MO-injected side compared with the ContMO or uninjected side of the same embryo. In contrast, loss of Sip1 protein did not increase Cad6B gene or protein expression at midbrain levels, but did somewhat delay the expression of Cad6B transcript without significantly affecting protein levels <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. S3</ref>).</p><p>Finally, we tested if concurrently knocking down Sip1 and overexpressing full-length chicken Ncad <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Shiau and Bronner-Fraser, 2009)</ref> at HH4 would rescue the loss-of-function phenotype. Whereas Sip1MO alone caused a decrease in neural crest Sip1 regulates cadherin switch in neural crest EMT • Rogers et al.</p><p>Cells lacking Sip1 are able to delaminate from the neural tube but cannot detach from each other, due to an increase in their cell-cell adhesion <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Figs. 3 and 4</ref>). Our data suggest that Sip1 mediates adhesive changes by regulating Ecad transcript expression and perhaps protein localization in early migratory avian NC cells. Knockdown of Sip1 leads to the up-regulation or maintenance of Ecad transcripts and protein in the epidermis, neural tube, and migratory NC cells in vivo <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 5, A-F)</ref>. In vitro, Ecad is absent from HNK1+ migrating NC cells in control explants but highly and aberrantly expressed on the cell surface of migrating crest cells after the loss of Sip1 <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 5, G and H)</ref>. The latter fail to disassociate from each other, preventing the completion of EMT. Sip1 is a well-characterized direct repressor of Ecad expression in cancer metastasis and during embryonic development <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Comijn et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Wakamatsu et al., 2001)</ref>. However, in early avian development, Sip1 and Ecad transcripts overlap in expression <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Dady et al., 2012)</ref>. Thus, the ability of Sip1 to act as a repressor of Ecad expression may be stagedependent and related to the availability of cofactors that may differ as a function of time. In the mouse, expression of Sip1 and Ecad appear to be mutually exclusive <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Wakamatsu et al., 2001</ref>). However, in chicken embryos the expression of endogenous switch between Ecad and Ncad in NC cells likely plays a critical role in completing EMT and creating functionally motile, mesenchymal NC cells.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sip1 is required to reduce Ecad in migratory NC cells</head><p>The expression of adhesion molecules undergoes a welldocumented transition that appears to be tightly regulated to allow for normal neural crest EMT <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Kerosuo and Bronner-Fraser, 2012)</ref>. It was previously thought that Ncad and Cad6B were the two most critical adhesion molecules involved in neural crest EMT; both are expressed at the onset of EMT and are down-regulated in the dorsal neural tube, facilitating cranial neural crest detachment from the neural tube <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Nakagawa and Takeichi, 1998)</ref>. Furthermore, maintenance of Cad6B in the dorsal neural tube leads to EMT defects <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Coles et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Strobl-Mazzulla and Bronner, 2012)</ref>. In the present study, however, we find that Cad6B is unaffected after Sip1 knockdown <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. S3)</ref>. Instead, Ecad, which is expressed on the apical side of the neural tube epithelium as well as in the early migratory NC <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Dady et al., 2012)</ref>, appears to play a critical role, paralleling the situation in many types of cancer cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Sivertsen et al., 2006)</ref>. Several possible mechanisms may account for the indirect down-regulation of Ncad after Sip1 loss of function. In addition to its transcriptional role, Sip1 has been shown to inhibit BMP signaling <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(van Grunsven et al., 2007)</ref>. In turn, BMP in the dorsal neural tube has been reported to down-regulate Ncad protein <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Shoval et al., 2007)</ref>. Thus, after loss of Sip1, BMP signaling may continue in dorsal neural tube cells, thereby inhibiting Ncad production. Consistent with this possibility, our NanoString data show that BMP4 transcripts are slightly up-regulated in the dorsal neural tube <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 5 A)</ref>. A second possibility is that up-regulation of both membrane-bound and cytoplasmic Ecad may lead to a decrease in Ncad expression, as has been reported in melanoma cells lines <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Kuphal and Bosserhoff, 2006)</ref>. Finally, the observed maintenance of FoxD3 expression in the cranial dorsal neural tube <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figs. 2 D and 3 A)</ref> may lead to aberrant repression of Ncad gene expression. In the trunk NC, which differs from cranial crest in its EMT program, FoxD3 has been shown to inhibit expression of Ncad while up-regulating integrin 1, laminin, and Cad7 <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Cheung et al., 2005)</ref>. Although these observations were made at a different axial level, our finding that Sip1 upregulates FoxD3 but down-regulates Ncad is consistent with these previous findings and may suggest that Sip1 indirectly regulates Ncad via FoxD3.</p><p>In summary, we show that Sip1, one of the best-characterized cancer EMT-related proteins, is also required for progression of the normal program that regulates neural crest EMT. We find that NC EMT is a two-step process requiring: (1) detachment from the neural tube and (2) a subsequent ability to separate from other NC cells. Sip1 plays a role in the second phase of NC EMT by inversely regulating adhesion molecules Ecad and Ncad in the migratory NC. This switch in cadherins is critical for NC cell EMT and strikingly similar to that observed during cancer metastasis as well as other EMTs such as those during cardiac development <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Lencinas et al., 2013)</ref>. Thus, the key role of Sip1 in regulating transcriptional and potential post-translational events is likely to have significant implications for understanding EMT in both developmental and oncological contexts.</p><p>Ecad transcript and protein is maintained in the apical neural tube cells and early migratory crest until approximately HH10-HH11, well after the onset of cranial NC EMT <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Dady et al., 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Our results show that NC cells lacking Sip1 maintain a high level of Ecad protein and therefore are unable to migrate normally. However, it is interesting to note that emigrating neural crest cells do normally express some Ecad protein as they leave the neural tube, suggesting a requirement for cell-cell adhesion in the early migrating neural crest cells. During studies of cancer EMT, there is conflicting evidence about the requirement for the down-regulation of adhesion molecules during EMT and metastasis. Recent work by <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Chui (2013)</ref> has suggested that the mesenchymal phenotype of cells does not necessarily confer metastasis; i.e., cancer cells do not need to undergo full EMT to detach from tumors, migrate, and invade other tissues. Our live-imaging studies (compare Video 1 with Video 2) have shown that even in control cells that migrate normally, NC cells appear to migrate as a transient group that is intermittently, but consistently, in contact with the cells that surround them. However, normal neural crest migration requires cell rearrangement to navigate through the ECM and tissues. Our data show that without Sip1, the cells are unable to detach from one another, leading to an inability to complete EMT and navigate through the ECM.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sip1 is required for Ncad expression</head><p>In addition to influencing Ecad levels and distribution, our results suggest that Sip1 influences Ncad expression. Ncad is normally expressed throughout the apical portion of the developing neural tube before NC EMT <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Akitaya and Bronner-Fraser, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Nakagawa and Takeichi, 1998)</ref>. As EMT commences, Ncad is down-regulated in the dorsal neural tube. In addition to the fulllength version in the neural tube, there also is a proteolytically cleaved variant of Ncad that is expressed in migratory NC and functions as an EMT activator <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Shoval et al., 2007)</ref>. After loss of Sip1, both Ncad transcript and protein expression are decreased <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Fig. 6</ref>). Despite the excess of Ecad protein that keeps NC cells clumped, it is possible that the observed concomitant excess loss of Ncad allows for their delamination after Sip1 knockdown. <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>. Diagram showing the effect of Sip1 knockdown on neural crest EMT. Our results show that NC cells undergoing the process of EMT go through two separate steps to become fully mesenchymal: (1) detachment from the neural tube and (2) separation from the ectoderm and dissociation from the other migratory NC cells. Compared with ContMO or untreated NC cells (left side), loss of Sip1 (right side) has no effect on step 1, but blocks step 2 due to the increased cell-cell adhesion caused by increased Ecad in the neural tube, epidermis, and migratory NC cells (red) and the loss of Ncad expression in the neural tube and migratory NC cells (orange). These data support a critical role for Sip1 in regulation of multiple adhesion molecules during neural crest EMT.

(C and D) Cell tracking and net displacement over time (t = 295 min) shows that Sip1MO-injected cells are unable to migrate long distances away from the midline and in a directional manner as is seen in Con-tMO embryos (G and H; t = 245 min). (H) Displacement of ContMO-injected cells demonstrates that NC cells near the LE actively migrate away from the midline while the NT appears to move away from the NC cells due to growth and movement. (I and J) Confocal imaging of a histological section from an embryo electroporated on the left side with memRFP + nucRFP and on the right side with Sip1MO + memRFP + nucRFP reveals that Sip1MO-treated cells remain clumped next to the midline (arrows). NT, neural tube; LE, leading edge. (C and G) white dots represent final time points for each track. (A and B) z = 8 µm; (E and F) z = 10 µm; (I and J) z = 6 µm. Bars, 30 µm. See also Videos 1-6. The data shown are representative of multiple repeats (experiment was repeated five [Sip1MO] and four [ContMO] times).</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_4"><head>Figure 5 .</head><label>5</label><figDesc>Sip1 knockdown leads to maintenance of Ecad protein in migratory NC cells. (A) Multiplex NanoString analysis of transcripts from neural tubes dissected from HH9 embryos, comparing the Sip1MO electroporated side to the control side of the same embryo. The results show that Ecad mRNA levels are up-regulated while Ncad and Cad7 are reduced (n = 3). The data shown here are representative of three separate experiments with the changes in transcript data pooled. (B) Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of neural tubes plus migratory crest cells dissected from HH9 embryos that were electroporated on the left side with ContMO (C) and on the right side with Sip1MO (S) at HH4. Ecad gene expression was compared with GAPDH expression. Error bars are standard deviation between samples and P &lt; 0.036 (asterisk indicates statistical significance; n = 4). The data shown here are one representative experiment with expression data from four embryos, and this was repeated four times. (C) Western blot analysis of Ecad protein expression after the injection of 1 mM ContMO and 1 mM Sip1MO showing that Ecad protein expression is increased after Sip1MO electroporation. The data shown here are representative of one experiment out of three repeats. In this experiment, protein was pooled from 8-10 chicken whole embryos. -Tubulin was used as a loading control. (D) In situ hybridization using a probe for Ecad shows that it is ectopically expressed in the neural tube after Sip1 knockdown (asterisk). Embryo injected on right side as indicated by asterisk. (E and F) Whole-mount immunohistochemistry for Ecad in midbrain sections at 40× in HH9 (E) and HH15 (F) embryos demonstrates increased sequestration of Ecad protein on the cell membranes on the Sip1MO side compared with the control side (white arrowheads). (G and H) To visualize the change in Ecad protein expression in vitro, neural tubes were dissected from HH8 embryos electroporated with ContMO on the left side and Sip1MO on the right side at HH4. Explants were cultured for 12-24 h and examined for expression of Ecad and HNK1. (G) ContMO-injected migratory neural crest cells express HNK1 (green) but lack Ecad expression (g, white arrows), whereas cells lacking Sip1 (H) emigrate from the neural tube explants (marked by white dashed line) but fail to detach from each other or migrate far from the explant (n = 6/8). Additionally, the Sip1MO-injected cells co-express HNK1 (green) and Ecad protein (h, white asterisk), suggesting that delamination from the neural tube explant does not require Ecad down-regulation, whereas subsequent detachment and migration does. (I and J) Whole-mount immunohistochemistry using an antibody for Pax7 in embryos electroporated with (I) ContMO on the left and Sip1 on the right (less migration on right) and (J) Sip1MO + Ecadcatenin on the right (recovered migration). Red dashed lines indicate midline and level of section. (i) A section through the embryo in panel I demonstrating clumped Pax7positive cells on the Sip1MO-injected side. (i) An overlay of Pax7 and FITC from ContMO and Sip1MO. (j) A section of the embryo from J demonstrating recovered Pax7-positive cells on the Sip1MO + Ecad-catenin-injected side. (j) An overlay of Pax7 and FITC Sip1MO. Bars: (D-J) 100 µm; (g-h) 30 µm; (i-j) 50 µm. The whole-mount and section data shown here are from a single representative experiment out of at least three repeats.</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_5"><head>Figure 6 .</head><label>6</label><figDesc>Ncad expression is reduced in cells lacking Sip1. (A) Quantitative PCR analysis of neural tubes and migratory crest cells dissected from HH9 embryos that were electroporated on the left side with ContMO and on the right side with Sip1MO at HH4. Ncad expression was compared with GAPDH expression. Error bars are standard deviation between samples and P &lt; 0.046 (n = 4). The data shown here are one representative experiment with expression data from four embryos, and this was repeated four times. Asterisk indicates statistical significance. (B) Western blot analysis of Ncad protein expression after the injection of 1 mM ContMO and 1 mM Sip1MO showing that Ncad protein expression is decreased after Sip1MO electroporation. -Tubulin was used as a loading control. The data shown here are representative of one experiment out of two repeats. In this experiment, protein was pooled from 8-10 chicken whole embryos.(C) Whole-mount in situ hybridization for Ncad expression in embryos lacking Sip1 on the right side shows a decrease in Ncad. (D) Confocal image of a section from an embryo, electroporated with ContMO on the left side and Sip1MO (green) on the right side, showing decrease in Ncad protein (red) expression (Z = 8 µm). (E and F) Whole-mount immunohistochemistry using an antibody for Snail2 of an embryo electroporated with (E) Sip1MO on the right side or (F) Sip1MO + Ncad-GFP DNA on the right side. Snail2 expression is reduced in the Sip1MO-injected cells, and this effect is rescued by co-electroporation of Sip1MO + Ncad-GFP cells. (e) A section from the embryo in E showing loss of Snail2 protein. (e) Overlay of Snail2 and Sip1MO. (f) A section from the embryo in F at the level indicated by dashed white line shows that although Snail2 appears reduced in whole mount, Snail2 expression and numbers of migratory NC cells are partially rescued. (G) Whole-mount immunohistochemistry using an antibody to Ecad on an embryo electroporated with Sip1MO + Ncad-GFP DNA on the right side shows that although Ecad protein is still increased on the injected side, it is at a lower level in the cells injected with high levels of Ncad-GFP and Sip1MO (indicated by dashed circle and white arrow) than with Sip1MO alone. Bars: (C and D) 30 µm; (E and F) 200 µm; (e and f) 100 µm; and (G and H) 50 µm. The whole-mount and section data shown here are from a single representative experiment out of at least three repeats.</figDesc></figure>
