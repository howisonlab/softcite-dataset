				<p>The molecular mechanism to regulate energy balance is not completely understood. Here we observed that Egr-1 expression in white adipose tissue (WAT) was highly correlated with dietary-induced obesity and insulin resistance both in mice and humans. Egr-1 null mice were protected from diet-induced obesity and obesity-associated pathologies such as fatty liver, insulin resistance, hyperlipidemia and hyperinsulinemia. This phenotype can be largely explained by the increase of energy expenditure in Egr-1 null mice. Characterization of these mice revealed that the expression of FOXC2 and its target genes were significantly elevated in white adipose tissues, leading to WAT energy expenditure instead of energy storage. Altogether, these studies suggest an important role for Egr-1, which, by repressing FOXC2 expression, promotes energy storage in WAT and favored the development of obesity under high energy intake.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>T</head><p>here is a wealth of evidence that energy regulatory and immune pathways are closely linked and interdependent. Many hormones, cytokines, signaling proteins, transcription factors, and bioactive lipids can function in both metabolic and immune regulation <ref type="bibr">1</ref> . Recent studies also demonstrate that obesity is an inflammatory condition in which chronic activation of the innate immune system ultimately causes progressive impairment of glucose tolerance 2 . However, the exact chain of molecular events linking overnutrition, activation of the innate immune system, and impairment of insulin signaling in peripheral tissues remain incompletely understood.</p><p>Early growth response-1 (Egr-1) is an inflammatory transcriptional factor. Egr-1 gene is located in ''Cytokine Cluster'' on 5q31 (cen--(IL4/IL5/IRF1/IL3/CSF2)--TCF7--IL9--EGR1--CD14--FGFA--SPARC--ADRA1-ter). It regulates a large set of inflammatory genes, including immune effector genes such as IL-2 (ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3)</ref> and TNFa <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">4</ref> , cell surface molecules such as IL-2 receptor <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">5</ref> , Fas/CD95 (ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">6</ref>) and ICAM-1 (ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">7)</ref>, and FasL <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">8</ref> . In addition, Egr-1 also regulates growth factors, such as insulin like growth factor-II, basic fibroblast growth factor <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9</ref> , epidermal growth factor receptor, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">10</ref> and transforming growth factor (TGF) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">11</ref> , and cell cycle regulators including the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene Rb <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">12</ref> , cyclin D1 (ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">13)</ref>, as well as hormones such as the luteinizing hormone b (LH-b) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">15</ref> . Therefore, Egr-1 not only regulates innate and adaptive immune response, but also plays important roles in cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. Egr-1 is also involved in metabolic diseases. In insulin resistant adipocytes, Egr-1 expression is still induced by insulin <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">16</ref> ; and thus, Egr-1 mRNA level is highly increased in adipocytes from diabetic animals <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">17</ref> . Indeed, Egr-1 can decrease adipocyte insulin sensitivity through tilting PI3K/Akt versus MAPK signal balance <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">18</ref> . These studies suggest that Egr-1 may be also involved in metabolic disorders. In contrast to Egr-1, another transcription factor FOXC2 was decreased in type 2 diabetes patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">19</ref> . Overexpression of FOXC2 in adipocytes leads to a lean and insulin-sensitive phenotype by increasing the sensitivity of the b-adrenergic-cAMP-PKA signaling pathway <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20</ref> .</p><p>In this study, we observed that Egr-1 expression in white adipose tissue (WAT) was highly associated with dietary-induced obesity and insulin resistance both in mice and humans. Egr-1 null mice were protected from diet-induced obesity and obesity-associated pathologies such as fatty liver, insulin resistance, hyperlipidemia and hyperinsulinemia. This phenotype can be largely explained by increase of energy expenditure in Egr-1 null mice. Characterization of these mice revealed that the expression of FOXC2 and its target genes was significantly elevated in white adipose tissues, which led WAT to expend instead to store energy. Taken together, these studies suggest an important role for Egr-1, which, by repressing FOXC2 expression, promotes energy storage in WAT and favors the development of obesity under high energy intake.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Egr-1 expression in white adipose tissue is associated with obesity and insulin resistance. As a stress response gene, Egr-1 is often rapidly and transiently activated by a variety of signals, including hypoxia, cytokines, growth factors and hormones <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21</ref> . Dietary-induced obesity is often associated with local hypoxia and inflammatory response in adipose tissues. To examine whether Egr-1 expression in adipose is associated with BMI and insulin resistance, 48 Caucasian non-diabetic men underwent euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp for insulin sensitivity and biopsy of subcutaneous abdominal fat for real-time, quantitative PCR (QPCR). As shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1a&amp;b</ref>, Egr-1 mRNA level was highly positively correlated with BMI, but negatively correlated with glucose disposal rate. In another compared experiment, 22 lean persons (BMI 5 25 6 1.6) and 7 obese persons (BMI 5 55 6 8.7) underwent biopsy of subcutaneous abdominal fat for QPCR. As shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1c</ref>, Egr-1 mRNA level was 80 folds higher in obese group than that in lean group. To further confirm that dietary obesity induces Egr-1 expression in adipose tissues, we tested the effect of HF diet feeding on the expression of Egr-1 in C57BL/6J mice. As shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. S1a</ref>, the body weight was significantly increased after 20 weeks of HF diet feeding. In the meantime, the fast glucose started to increase at 12 weeks and further increased significantly at 20 weeks of HF diet feeding <ref type="figure">(Fig.  S1b</ref>). The level of Egr-1 mRNA in WAT was markedly increased after 12 weeks of high-fat feeding and further increased at 20 weeks of HF <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> | Egr-1 mRNA levels in WAT are associated with obesity and insulin resistance. (a&amp;b) Egr-1 mRNA levels in WAT from 48 Caucasian nondiabetic men were measured by QPCR. Glucose disposal rate was measured by hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps and the data on Rd were computed in mg/min/kg of lean body mass for those lean persons (n 5 48, BMI, 24.0 6 0.75). After log transformation, linear regression analysis revealed a strong correlation (r 2 5 0.6838, p , 0.0001) between Egr-1 mRNA level in WAT and body mass index of the donor subject (a) and a weak negatively correlation (r 2 5 0.2423, P 5 0.0023) between Egr-1 mRNA level in WAT and Glucose disposal rate (mg/min/kg) (b). (c) Egr-1 mRNA levels in WAT from lean (n 5 22, BMI, 24.0 6 0.75) and obese (n 5 7, BMI, 52 6 3.1) humans were measured by QPCR. (d). C57BL/6J mice were purchased from Jackson laboratories and divided into two groups fed with chow-diet or high-fat diet, respectively. Egr-1 mRNA level was examined by QPCR both in chow-fed or high-fat fed mice after 4, 12 and 20 weeks of feeding (n 5 5). Values were normalized by 18S and fold changes to 4-week, chow-fed group were represented. (e) Egr-1 mRNA levels in adipose tissues from ob/ob and its control mice. Male, 12-week-old mice were sacrificed and RNA was isolated from adipose tissues as indicated. QPCR was performed to measure Egr-1 mRNA levels using the primers as shown in <ref type="table">Table S1</ref>. Data represent mean 6 SD, n 5 5.</p><p>diet feeding, which was closely associated with dietary-induced obesity and insulin resistance <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1d)</ref>. In contrast, no significant alteration in expression level of Egr-1 mRNA was observed in other tissues that also contribute to energy homeostasis including hypothalamus, liver, skeletal muscle, and adrenal upon high-fat feeding (data not shown). In ob/ob mice, Egr-1 mRNA level was significantly increased in visceral and subcutaneous WAT, but not in brown adipose, compared with control mice <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1e</ref>). Taken together, these results suggest that Egr-1 expression in WAT is highly associated with dietary-induced obesity and insulin resistance.</p><p>Loss of Egr-1 protects against diet-induced obesity. To define the functional relevance of dietary obesity-induced adipocyte Egr-1 upregulation in mice, we challenged 9-to 10-week-old wild-type and Egr-1 null mice with a high-fat (HF) diet (60% calories from fat) for 15 weeks. The Egr-1 2/2 mice showed blunted weight gain in response to this dietary challenge, which was evident after the first 5 weeks of feeding ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 2a</ref>). After 15 weeks, the wild-type mice showed 105 6 13% weight gain, but the Egr-1 null mice gained only one-third as much, 38 6 20%. The weight gain of the chow-fed Egr-1 2/2 (26%) mice was also lower than that of wild-type (38%) mice, but the difference was not significant. This phenotype was observed in both male and female mice and in both mid-term feeding (12 weeks) and long-term feeding (20 weeks) <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. S2</ref>). The body-weight difference was largely due to a decrease in fat mass. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis showed that the fat mass ratio in Egr-1 2/2 mice was 61% lower than that in wild-type mice under HF diet feeding <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 2b)</ref>. The fat ratio of chow-fed Egr-1 2/2 (13%) mice was also lower than that of wild-type (23%) mice, but the difference was not significant. Adipocytes were enlarged in the white fat of the HF fed wild-type mice but were smaller in Egr-1 null mice <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 2c)</ref>. In brown fat, HF diet induced more lipid accumulation in wild-type mice, but not in Egr-1 null mice. The HF diet also induced fatty liver in the wild-type mice, but the livers of the HF fed Egr-1 2/2 animals contained almost no visible lipid droplets, which were confirmed by marked differences in Oil Red O staining <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 2c</ref>). Consistent with this, hepatic triglyceride and cholesterol contents were significantly lower in Egr-1 2/2 mice <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 2d&amp;e</ref>). Loss of Egr-1 protects from diet-induced insulin resistance and hyperlipidemia. To further characterize the obesity resistant phenotype in Egr-1 2/2 mice fed a HF diet, carbohydrate and lipid metabolism were analyzed. As expected, the leaner Egr-1 2/2 mice showed greater insulin sensitivity. Their plasma glucose levels were not significantly different from those in wild-type mice on either chow or HF diet. However, plasma insulin levels were 9% lower in the chow-fed Egr-1 2/2 mice compared to the wild-type mice, and were markedly lower (65%) in the HF diet-fed Egr-1 2/2 mice than in HF-fed wild-type mice <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 3a)</ref>. As an indicator of body fat, consistent with their obesity, leptin level in wild-type mice was increased substantially (3-fold) by HF diet feeding. In comparison, basal level of leptin was lower in Egr-1 2/2 mice than in wild-type mice and was not increased significantly by HF diet feeding <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 3a)</ref>. We next performed glucose and insulin tolerance tests. On chowdiet, both wild-type and Egr-1 null mice showed normal response after glucose or insulin perfusion. However, the HF-fed Egr-1 2/2 mice showed relatively normal responses, while the HF-fed wildtype mice showed insulin intolerance ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 3b</ref>) and glucose intolerance ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 3c</ref>). As expected, HF diet feeding induced hyperlipidemia in wild-type mice, while this was much attenuated in HF-fed Egr-1 null mice. Lipoprotein analysis revealed that on HF diet, Egr-1 2/2 mice had substantially lower triglycerides and cholesterol in their VLDL and LDL/HDL fractions respectively compared with wild-type mice <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 3d</ref>). These differences were not seen in the mice on chow diet (data not shown). Total plasma triglyceride and free fatty acid levels were not different in the wildtype compared with Egr-1 null mice, indicating that the reduced fat weight was not secondary to decreased lipid availability. However, total plasma cholesterol levels were significantly decreased in Egr-1 2/2 mice compared with wild-type littermates <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 3e</ref>).</p><p>Loss of Egr-1 increases energy expenditure. To examine whether obesity resistance in Egr-1 2/2 mice was due to alterations in feeding behavior, food intake and fat absorption were measured. Despite of their inability to gain weight on HF diet, Egr-1 2/2 mice exhibited a food intake per body weight that was comparable to that of wild-type mice fed the same diet ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 4a)</ref>. When integrated into a formula that takes into consideration food intake, stool output, and lipid content, no significant changes in fat absorption were observed in Egr-1 2/2 mice compared to wild-type mice both on chow and HF diet <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. 4b</ref>). These results indicated that resistance to obesity of Egr-1 null mice was not due to decreased energy intake. Thus, their resistance to diet induced obesity should be a consequence of increased in energy expenditure. This was confirmed by both direct and indirect approaches, including analysis of oxygen consumption, CO2 generation and body temperature. The body temperature was higher in the HF fed Egr-1 null mice compared to that in HF fed wild-type mice <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. 4c</ref>). HF-fed Egr-1 2/2 mice showed significantly higher O2 consumption ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 4d and Fig. S3a)</ref>) and CO2 generation than control wild-type littermates over 24 h ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 4e and Fig. S3b</ref>). We also monitored the physical activity during a three-day period and did not observe any difference in the movement rate between Egr-1 2/2 and wild-type mice ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 4f and Fig. S3c)</ref>). Together, these results indicated that resistance to obesity of Egr-1 2/2 mice was due to increased energy expenditure by increasing metabolic rate.</p><p>Loss of Egr-1 increases FOXC2 expression in white adipose tissues. It was interestingly to note that the phenotype of Egr-1 2/2 mice resistant to obesity is very similar to that of aP2-FOXC2 transgenic mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20</ref> . Thus, we measured FOXC2 mRNA levels in liver, muscle, white and brown fats from wild-type and Egr-1 null mice. At first, we confirmed the Egr-1 expression in adipose from wild-type and Egr-1 null mice by Northern blot <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Fig. 5a</ref>). Interestingly, FOXC2 was increased by 2 folds in white fat of Egr-1 null mice on chow diet and further increased by 4 folds by HF diet feeding. FOXC2 was not expressed in liver, muscle and brown fat <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Fig. 5b)</ref>. To further confirm the expression changes of FOXC2 in Egr-1 2/2 white fat, we measured FOXC2 protein levels by Western blotting. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 5c</ref>, FOXC2 protein is expressed in white fat, but not in liver and muscle. Consistent with its mRNA changes, FOXC2 protein was also increased in the white fat of Egr-1 2/2 mice both on chow diet and HF diet feeding.</p><p>Loss of Egr-1 increases UCP1 expression in white adipose tissues. As reported, WAT in mice with an overexpression of FOXC2 acquired certain BAT-like properties with increased expression of PGC1, UCP1 and cAMP pathway proteins such as b1-adrenoceptor (b1-AR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20</ref> . So we have measured the expression of b1-AR, PGC-1a, PGC1b and UCP1 in WAT from both wild-type and Egr-1 null mice under chow and HF diet feeding by QPCR. As showed in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 6a</ref>, the expression of b1-AR was significantly increased in Egr-1 null WAT compared that in wild-type WAT under both chow and HF diet feeding. Though PGC1a and PGC1b were not changed in WAT under chow diet feeding, they were increased in Egr-1 null WAT under HF diet feeding. UCP1 was not expressed in WAT from both wild-type and Egr-1 null mice under chow diet, but UCP1 expression was higher in Egr-1 null WAT than that in wild-type WAT under HF diet feeding, which was further confirmed by Western blot <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 6b&amp;c)</ref>. These results suggest the WAT in Egr-1 null mice gains some BAT-like features under HF diet feeding.</p><p>Loss of Egr-1 decreases inflammatory cytokine production in white adipose tissues. It is well documented that obesity is an inflammatory condition leading to chronic activation of the innate immune system and Egr-1 is an inflammatory transcription factor controlling many cytokines expression including TNFa, PAI-1 etc <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22</ref> . Therefore, we measured the plasma levels of these cytokines as well as their mRNA levels. As expected, the production of TNFa was increased after HF diet feeding in wild-type mice, but not in Egr-1 2/2 mice <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Fig. 7a)</ref>. PAI-1 level was also increased in wild-type mice after HF diet feeding. The PAI-1 level was lower in HF diet-fed Egr-1 null mice, but no statistical significance. The production of adiponectin was not changed between two genotypes under both chow and HF diet feeding. Consistent with this, the TNFa mRNA level was also significantly increased in wild-type WAT after HF diet feeding, but not in Egr-1 2/2 WAT <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Fig. 7b)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Through the story of evolution, animals and humans have developed potent and redundant mechanisms that promote the accumulation of energy in fat tissue during periods of ''feast'', thus enabling survival during periods of ''famine'' <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">23</ref> . As a consequence, obesity has reached epidemic proportions in the current ''obesigenic'' environment of readily available high-energy foods and little need for physical activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">24</ref> . Understanding the regulatory pathways that govern energy storage (i.e., fat accumulation) versus energy expenditure (i.e., fat oxidation) is a key to understanding the diseases of obesity and its associated metabolic syndrome. Here we demonstrate a key role of dietary obesity-induced Egr-1 in adipocytes in the preservation and progression of obesity and obesity-associated pathologies, such as fatty liver, hyperlipidemia, and insulin resistance. Our findings support a model wherein nutrition overload leads to significant expansion of adipose tissue, which further induces Egr-1 expression probably by creating a stress and hypoxic environment. Egr-1 expression not only induces the synthesis and release of adipokines, such as TNFa, to promote insulin resistance, but also suppresses the FOXC2-cAMP-PKA metabolic regulatory system to facilitate energy storage and promote the development of obesity and obesity-associated pathologies <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">(Fig. 8)</ref>.</p><p>As an early response gene, Egr-1 is often rapidly and transiently activated by a variety of signals including stress, growth factors, cytokines and hormones. And as a transcription factor, Egr-1 is able to regulate many genes expression and thus is involved in the regulation of cell growth, differentiation and apoptosis. Here we found sustained expression of Egr-1 in WAT under obese and diabetic conditions both in mice and human. The sustained expression of Egr-1 may be caused by nutrition overload-created stress and hypoxic environment in WAT or by obesity-associated hyperinsulinemia. It was previously reported that Egr-1 remains insulin sensitive in insulin-resistant adipocytes <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">16</ref> . We further found that the sustained expression of Egr-1 in adipocytes facilitated energy storage and thus promoted the development of obesity and obesity-associated pathologies, so that loss of Egr-1 led to brown adipose-like change of WAT ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 6</ref>), leading to energy expenditure over energy storage and thus protected mice from nutrition overload-induced obesity and obesityassociated pathologies. It is interesting to note that dietary obesityinduced Hif1a in adipocytes also restricts fatty acid oxidation and energy expenditure via suppression of the Sirt2-NAD1 system <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">25</ref> , suggesting there are some redundant mechanisms to promote energy storage under nutrition overload status. To further examine the specific effect of Egr-1 overexpression in adipocytes, we have generated an adipocyte-specific Egr-1 transgenic mouse line by using aP2 promoter ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. S4)</ref>. Interestingly, forced expression of Egr-1 in adipocytes without nutrition overload did not cause the changes of weight gain and insulin sensitivity, suggesting that Egr-1 participates in the management of energy only under chronic nutrition overloadinduced stress.  Mechanistically, we found that the Egr-1-dependent effects on adipocyte lipid catabolism were mediated through regulation of the FOXC2-cAMP-PKA pathway. FOXC2 is a member of forkhead transcription factors and normally expressed only in adipose tissue. FOXC2 promoter polymorphism and abnormal expression had been shown associated with obesity and insulin resistance <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref> . Overexpression of FOXC2 in adipose tissue causes a profound gene expression change including b-adrenergic receptors, PPARs and PGC-1, and BAT-specific gene UCP1 in WAT depot, which drives WAT depot to acquire a brown fat-like histology and to dissipate energy rather than to store energy <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">31</ref> . To address the molecular mechanisms underlying the phenotype of Egr-1 2/2 mice resistant to diet-induced obesity, we found a significant increase in the expression of FOXC2 in WAT of Egr-1 2/2 mice on both chow diet and HF  diet. Consistently, Egr-1 null WAT expressed some BAT-specific genes such as UCP1 and PGC1 under HF diet feeding. These results suggest that Egr-1 may function as a repressor of FOXC2 gene expression and suppresse FOXC2-mediated energy expenditure program in WAT to facilitate energy storage in WAT under high caloric intake. Further investigation to uncover the mechanisms by which Egr-1 regulates FOXC2 expression will help to understand the regulatory networks underlying obesity and obesity-associated pathologies. A recent report showed that Egr-1 promotes insulin resistance under chronic high-insulin-induced stress by controlling PI3K/Akt and MAPK signal balance via direct induction of the gene expression of PTEN and GGPPS in adipocytes <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">18</ref> , suggesting that Egr-1 may regulate glucose and lipid metabolisms through multiple mechanisms.</p><p>As the body's largest endocrine organ and one of the most important insulin targeting tissues, adipose tissue has a critical role in insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">33</ref> . Although we cannot at present fully exclude a contribution of tissues beyond WAT to the metabolic alterations in Egr-1 2/2 mice, several arguments support the concept that WAT play a predominant role. First, thermogenic effectors such as PGC-1 and UCP-1 were increased in WAT but not in BAT and skeletal muscle. Second, the absence of major changes in non-adipose-derived endocrine modulators of adaptive thermogenesis and fat accumulation suggests that these metabolic alterations were not due to neuroendocrine defects. Finally, ingestion of a chronic high-fat diet induced changes in Egr-1 expression only in WAT, but not in other organs involved in metabolism (hypothalamus, adrenal and liver). A recent study also supported this concept <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">18</ref> . Yu et al. inhibited Egr-1 transcriptional activity in diabetic db/ db mice by injecting adenovirus carrying dominant-negative Egr-1 (dnEgr-1) into epididymal fat pads, which is the predominant fat tissue in mice intra-abdominal cavity. They found that expression of dnEgr-1 epididymal fat was able to significantly improve glucose tolerance and increase insulin sensitivity in db/db mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">18</ref> .</p><p>High-fat feeding causes adipose expansion not only by lipid accumulation but also by adipogenesis. As reported, Egr-2, another member in Egr family, is an important regulator of adipogenesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">34</ref> . Boyle et al. reported that Egr-1 and Egr-2 exert opposing influence on adipocyte differentiation <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">35</ref> . We found that Egr-1, -2 and -3 were all rapidly induced and transiently expressed at early stage during 3T3-L1 adipogenesis. The transient expression of Egr-1 was required for 3T3-L1 adipogenesis as loss of Egr-1 decreased adipogenesis <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Fig.  S5)</ref>. So the reduction of adipogenesis in Egr-1 null mice may also contribute to its lean phenotype.</p><p>In conclusion, our work identified Egr-1 as a central regulator of adipocyte energy storage. Egr-1 mediates these effects, at least in part, by interfering with the FOXC2-cAMP-PKA pathway, thereby creating a metabolic state permissive for the development of obesity in the face of nutrient overload. Since adipose Egr-1 accumulation in human obese subjects correlates with obesity and insulin resistance, intervention of Egr-1 activity may represent a therapeutic approach for obesity in humans.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p>Human study. Volunteers were recruited through public advertisement and were screened for hematological and blood chemistry abnormalities. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas. All subjects signed a written informed consent. Subjects with diabetes mellitus and other endocrine disorders, coronary heart disease, and liver function test abnormalities, and those receiving any form of therapies, were excluded from the study. At the time of enrollment, each volunteer was administered a health history questionnaire. Height, weight, and blood pressure measurements were taken on all of the subjects. Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps was performed as described previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">36</ref> . The rate of glucose disposal (Rd) was calculated by subtracting the urinary glucose excretion from the Ra and using space correction. The data on Rd were computed in mg/min/kg of lean body mass. Samples of subcutaneous adipose tissue are taken from both the abdomen and right buttock under local anesthesia using a biopsy needle. About 140 mg of subcutaneous adipose tissue is taken from each site and QPCR was performed as described below.</p><p>Animal experiments. The generation of the Egr-1 null mouse line has been described previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">15</ref> . Egr-1 1/2 breeding pairs was kindly provided by Dr. David Pinsky. Egr-1 null mice are on mixed C57BL/6/129/Sv backgrounds and have been backcrossed to C57BL/6J background more than 10 generations. Age-and sex-matched groups of 8to 9-week-old wild-type and Egr-1 2/2 siblings derived from heterozygous intercrosses of Egr-1 1/2 were used in the experiments. C57BL/6J mice used in the chronic high-fat feeding study were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, Maine, USA). All mice were housed in a temperature-controlled environment with 12 hr light/dark cycles. For high-fat diet experiments, one group of mice were fed a chow diet (D12450B, Research Diets, New Brunswick, NJ) containing 10 kcal% fat and the other group were fed a high-fat diet (D12492) containing 60 kcal% fat for 12 to 20 weeks. Body weight was recorded weekly, and food intake and fast blood glucose were measured biweekly. Total body fat mass was analyzed by NMR using the Minispec mq spectrometer (Bruker). Rectal temperature was measured using Thermalert (Physitemp, Clifton, NJ, USA). At the end of the feeding period, mice were anesthetized with halothane and exsanguinated via the ascending vena cava prior to organ harvest. Blood was kept on ice in heparin-coated tubes (Microvette 500 LH; Sarstedt, Inc.) and centrifuged (1500 3 g for 15 min at 4uC), and the plasma was stored at 220uC until analysis. Tissues were harvested for analyses as described below. All experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Research Advisory Committee at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center.</p><p>Lipid absorption. In week 10 of high-fat diet study, stools were collected from individually housed mice over 72 h. Lipid content of diets and stools was determined gravimetrically and used to calculate the fraction of consumed lipid that was absorbed as described in <ref type="figure">Figure 1B</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">37</ref> .</p><p>Liver triglycerides and cholesterol. Cholesterol was extracted from saponified liver (0.3 g) with petroleum ether and quantitated by gas chromatography using stigmasterol as an internal standard. Other lipids were extracted from liver (0.2 g) in chloroform:methanol (251, v/v). Extracts were then washed once in 50 mM NaCl and twice in 0.36 M CaCl 2 /methanol. The organic phase was separated and brought up to 5 ml with chloroform. Ten microliters of chloroform:Triton X-114 (151, v/v) were added to duplicate 100 ml aliquots of each extract and standards (Sigma Diagnostics), which were then air dried overnight. Colorimetric enzymatic assays were performed using 1 ml triglyceride reagent (ThermoTrace). After 20 min, optical densities of each sample were read at 520 nm and compared to prepared standards.</p><p>Plasma analyses and glucose and insulin tolerance. For glucose tolerance, mice were fasted overnight before receiving an intraperitoneal injection of 20% D-glucose (Sigma) (2 g/kg body weight). At 0, 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min after injection, 5-10 ml of blood was drawn from the tail and blood glucose levels assayed using an Elite XL Glucometer (Bayer). For insulin tolerance, mice were fasted for 6 h before receiving an intraperitoneal injection of insulin 10 U/ml (sigma) (0.75 U/kg body Nutrition overload leads to significant expansion of adipose tissue, which further induces Egr-1 expression probably by creating a stress and hypoxic environment. Egr-1 expression not only induces the synthesis and release of adipokines, such as TNFa, to promote insulin resistance, but also suppresses the FOXC2-cAMP-PKA metabolic regulatory system to facilitate energy storage and promote the development of obesity and obesity-associated pathologies. weight). Then the blood glucose levels were assayed following the procedures above. Different enzymatic assays were used for each analyte, including total cholesterol (Roche Diagnostics), plasma triglycerides (ThermoTrace), free fatty acids (Roche). Plasma lipoprotein levels were analyzed by fast protein liquid chromatography using two serial Superose HR6 columns, followed by enzymatic analysis of their cholesterol and triglyceride contents using the kits described above. Plasma leptin, insulin, adiponectin, tPAI-1 were determined by using Lincoplex Luminex kit (LINCO Research, St. Charles, Missouri, USA). TNFa level was determined using mouse TNFa ELISA Kit (eBioscience, Boston, MA, USA).</p><p>Metabolic rate and movement measurements. Metabolic monitoring was performed using a Comprehensive Lab Animal Monitoring System (CLAMS, Columbia Instruments) that simultaneously measures whole-body O 2 consumption and physical movements for 16 mice. Mice were acclimated in the monitoring chambers for 2 days before the experiment to minimize the changes in housing environments. Data was collected every 48 min for each mouse over a period of 3 days. Metabolic rate and physical activity were averaged for the whole study period with the exception of the first five data points that tend to be influenced by animal handling at the beginning of studies.</p><p>Real-time PCR analysis. Total RNA was extracted from tissues using RNA STAT-60 (Tel-Test, Inc.), treated with DNase I (RNase-free, Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and reversely transcribed into cDNA with random hexamers using the SuperScript II First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen). Primers for each mRNA were designed using Primer Express Software (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) based on sequence data from GenBankTM <ref type="table">(Table S1</ref> and ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">38</ref>) and were validated as described <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">39</ref> . Real-time PCR reactions contained 10-25 ng cDNA, 150 nM of each primer, and 5 ml 2X-Jump Start SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Sigma) in 10 ml total volume. PCR reactions were performed in triplicate using an Applied Biosystems Prism 7900 HT instrument. Relative mRNA levels were calculated using either the comparative C T or standard curve methods normalized to cyclophilin mRNA or 18S RNA, respectively.</p><p>Western blotting and northern blotting. Proteins were isolated by the kit from Perkin Elmar and resolved on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and electrotransferred to a PVDF membrane (Amersham). The membrane was then hybridized with rabbit anti-mouse FOXC2 (Chemicon, Temecula, CA), UCP-1 (Sigma) at a 151000 dilution, followed by secondary antibody incubation at a 151000 dilution. FOXC2 and UCP-1specific bands were detected by chemiluminescence (ECL kit, Amersham).
