			<abstract>
				<p>Network meta-analysis (NMA) has emerged as a useful analytical tool allowing comparison of multiple treatments based on direct and indirect evidence. Commonly, a hierarchical Bayesian NMA model is used, which allows rank probabilities (the probability that each treatment is best, second best, and so on) to be calculated for decision making. However, the statistical properties of rank probabilities are not well understood. This study investigates how rank probabilities are affected by various factors such as unequal number of studies per comparison in the network, the sample size of individual studies, the network configuration, and effect sizes between treatments. In order to explore these factors, a simulation study of four treatments (three equally effective treatments and one less effective reference) was conducted. The simulation illustrated that estimates of rank probabilities are highly sensitive to both the number of studies per comparison and the overall network configuration. An unequal number of studies per comparison resulted in biased estimates of treatment rank probabilities for every network considered. The rank probability for the treatment that was included in the fewest number of studies was biased upward. Conversely, the rank of the treatment included in the most number of studies was consistently underestimated. When the simulation was altered to include three equally effective treatments and one superior treatment, the hierarchical Bayesian NMA model correctly identified the most effective treatment, regardless of all factors varied. The results of this study offer important insight into the ability of NMA models to rank treatments accurately under several scenarios. The authors recommend that health researchers use rank probabilities cautiously in making important decisions.</p>

In particular, few simulations have explored the operating characteristics of rank probabilities obtained from an NMA. Some concern has been raised about the use of rank probabilities in decision making. Researchers argue that rank probability is sensitive to various factors and it is biased when there is a paucity of direct comparisons. Because of this fragility, researchers claim that decisions based on rank probabilities should not be trusted unless accompanied with effect sizes of pairwise comparisons, such as means and their credible intervals, as in some cases individual treatments may be disqualified on the basis of cost or clinical contraindication. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref> If there are few trials per comparison, as in the study by Haas et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">27</ref> for neonatal mortality outcome, it may lead to the problem of overestimating rates, suggesting extra caution should be exercised when interpreting the treatment rankings.

The simulation was conducted for a binary outcome.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Motivating example</head><p>A recently published article shared the results from pair-wise comparisons of four treatments in the reduction of heavy menstrual bleeding, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">28</ref> including analysis of individual patient data. The authors conducted a wide-range search for studies that compared hysterectomy (hyster), endometrial destruction (both first-generation hysteroscopic [1gen] and secondgeneration nonhysteroscopic [2gen] techniques), and the levonorgestrel releasing intrauterine system (Mirena) from the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL databases and reference lists. The authors found that the level of satisfaction with treatment was the most commonly measured outcome across all identified studies, with 21 out of 30 using this measure, and used it as their primary outcome measure. Direct and indirect comparisons among the four treatments were made without an NMA approach. The binary outcome data from 20 of these two-arm studies were available, and the resulting network is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>.</p><p>The network plot reveals an unequal number of studies per comparison and the absence of direct evidence between some of the pairs of treatments (eg, hyster and Mirena). An NMA synthesizing all evidence simultaneously was not conducted and rank probabilities were not estimated.</p><p>Using the available raw data (from the identified studies), a Bayesian NMA was performed for the purpose of yielding probabilistic conclusions. It was possible to determine estimates for both relative effect sizes and rank probabilities through Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation sampling using an R package called gemtc. The pairwise estimates are available in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>. Based on this table, hysterectomy is the treatment yielding the greatest reduction of patients' dissatisfaction regarding heavy menstrual bleeding, with the remaining three treatments relatively indistinguishable. These estimates are very similar to their findings despite the methods applied.</p><p>The rank probabilities of the four treatments are provided in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 2</ref>. This ranking supports the conclusion that hysterectomy is the most effective treatment. However, when working with real data, there is no way to know if any bias is present in the findings. This paper will consider what factors might influence these rank probabilities. The focus will be on the first rank probability (ie, the first column of <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 2</ref>). Using comprehensive simulations, possible sources of bias in networks similar to this one (eg, the effect of unequal studies per comparison) will be assessed.</p><p>The rest of this article is organized as follows. First, a brief description of the NMA method is provided. Next, the simulation approach is described, results are presented, and a discussion and limitations of the simulation are given. Finally, a conclusion is provided.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p>The NMA method relies on the fundamental assumptions of homogeneity, similarity, and consistency. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">29</ref> Homogeneity requires the effect of treatments to be similar across trials, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">30</ref> similarity (or transitivity) requires that relative treatment effects are assumed to be exchangeable, and consistency (or coherence) requires that evidence from both direct and indirect comparisons is in agreement. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32</ref> Assumptions can prove difficult to verify. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">33</ref> In NMA, a network's geometry uses nodes to represent interventions and edges to represent the direct comparisons between interventions. The amount of available information is often represented in network plots by varying the sizes of nodes and thickness of edges. The visual depiction of a network can reveal that some treatments are included in significantly more studies than others. This disparity may come from comparator preference bias, sponsorship bias, selective reporting bias, and time lag bias. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">4</ref> Network geometries range from simple (a network with only three treatments) to very complex (a network with multiple treatments). <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">34</ref> In this simulation study, graphical networks that often result from systematic reviews were considered: star, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">36</ref> loop, one closed loop, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">37</ref> and ladder (linear) <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">37</ref>  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Figure 2</ref>). All of the four network patterns also exist together in the paper published by Lu and Ades. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">23</ref> Each network comprises four nodes representing four interventions (treatments one to four labeled T 1 , T 2 , T 3 , and T 4 ). Except for the star pattern, each configuration has both direct and indirect evidence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>statistical details</head><p>In NMA, input data are summary statistics gathered from published literature. The aggregate input data might be available in two formats: arm-level summaries (eg, odds, absolute risk, hazard, mean) or contrast-level summaries (eg, odds ratio, risk ratio, hazard ratio, mean difference). Arm-level data, which is modeled with the exact likelihood rather than its normal approximation, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">6</ref> were adopted in this simulation study. Both frequentist and Bayesian frameworks can suitably fit models for either of the two data formats. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">38</ref> Although inference based on NMA can be made in both frequentist and Bayesian frameworks, Bayesian NMA is more common and provides two advantages. First, it allows researchers to incorporate prior knowledge for parameters of interest and a rich and flexible family of models can be fitted. Second, treatment rank probabilities can be calculated easily. Employing a Bayesian framework requires the calculation of posterior distributions using MCMC methods. Procedures are described in detail by Salanti et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">11</ref> Furthermore, Bayesian inferences are exact for finite samples when appropriate priors are used (unlike frequentist inference, which relies on a normality assumption) and, hence, are more appealing, especially with small samples.</p><p>The calculation of rank probabilities is also straightforward in the Bayesian framework. For every MCMC run, each treatment in the study is ranked based on the relative effect estimates. The proportion of MCMC cycles in which the treatment ranks first gives the probability that it is the best among all competing treatments in the study. Similarly, rank probabilities of being second best, third best, and so on are computed for every treatment.  The general linear model for NMA has been proposed by several researchers. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">39</ref> The model can be fitted for different types of data, including normal, binomial, Poisson, and multinomial. The following sections will review how the Bayesian NMA model can be fitted for arm-level study summaries of binary outcomes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fixed effects models in NMA</head><p>This section describes both fixed and random effects NMA models confined to binary outcomes. Suppose that there are N randomized controlled trials that compare K treatments. Let r ik be the number of events of the ith clinical trial in the arm representing treatment k. Let n ik represent the number of observations and p ik denote the corresponding success probability for treatment k in study i. Then the distribution of the number of events is given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">r Bin p n i N k K ik ik ik ( , ), , , ; , , = = 1 12 … … (1)</formula><p>where p ik represents the corresponding probability of a successful outcome for treatment k and is modeled on the logit scale as: </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Random effects models in NMA</head><p>In a random effects model, each study i provides an estimate of the study-specific log odds, δ i,1k which are assumed to be independent of the order in which they were carried out (exchangeable). Then, the random effects model is obtained by replacing d i,1k in the above fixed effects model by δ i,1k , ie, </p><formula xml:id="formula_1">log ( ) log ,<label>, , ; , , ; . ,</label></formula><p>With regard to choice of priors for hyperparameters, it is common to set weakly informative priors that let the data speak, usually µ</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">β i d N bk , ,<label>( , )</label></formula><p>∼ 0 10 4 . <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">39</ref> For the likelihood of binomial outcomes with logit link models, a uniform flat prior for the standard deviation (ie, σ ∼ Uniform ( , ) 0 5 ) 40 is usually used. A flat γ prior on the precision (ie, 1/σ γ 2 0 001 0 001 ∼ ( . , . )) is another alternative. It assigns small weights to a large standard deviation. This feature may be useful particularly when data are sparse to improve numerical stability and speed convergence of MCMC sampling.</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">A C D B T 1 T 1 T 1 T 2 T 2 T 2 T 2 T 1 T 3 T 3 T 3 T 3 T 4 T 4 T 4 T 4</formula><p>The dramatic increase of interest in the Bayesian analysis is primarily because of the emergence of MCMC methods. While the MCMC method provides a convenient way to draw inference from complicated statistical models, there are some problems associated with this method. One of these problems is that convergence in MCMC sampler is a complex issue. It usually needs a large number of iterations to reach convergence. In addition, early MCMC iterations are highly sensitive to starting values of parameters and do not provide good information about the target distribution and, hence, are required to be thinned. The basic idea is that although the chains look divergent at early iterations due to different starting points, when the MCMC algorithm is converged, the chains should mix together and become indistinguishable from each other as they converge to the same posterior distribution. In this study, the package gemtc (http://cran.r-proct.org/web/packages/gemtc/index.html) from the R library, was used to implement the Bayesian NMA through MCMC simulation nicely, and is compatible with other packages that can conduct convergence diagnostics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Simulation studies</head><p>In this section, the simulation design and results are provided. As outlined in the Background section, this simulation study addresses how an unequal number of studies per comparison affects the ranking of treatments and the influence of network configuration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>simulation design</head><p>In this study, four treatments were considered and twoarm level binary data were simulated. The treatments were denoted T 1 (placebo), T 2 , T 3 , and T 4 . The parameters varied during simulation are given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref>. Three scenarios were considered. The first two scenarios used the success probability conditions (0.1, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5) for (T 1 , T 2 , T 3 , T 4 ). In both scenarios, three equivalent treatments were compared with a reference treatment, T 1 . The difference between the two scenarios was the position of the reference treatment within the network configuration, ie, T 1 and T 3 were interchanged. The third scenario with success probabilities (0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.8) for (T 1 , T 2 , T 3 , T 4 ) compared a superior treatment with the remaining equally inferior treatments. Under each of the three scenarios, four different network patterns, seven different numbers of studies per comparison, and three different study-level sample sizes were used to simulate arm-level data.</p><p>For the ladder and star geometries, the unequal number of studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">15)</ref> denoted the number of studies for the comparisons between treatments (T 1 and T 2 , T 2 and T 3 , T 3 and T 4 ) and (T 1 and T 2 , T 1 and T 3 , T 1 and T 4 ), respectively.

Lastly, for the completely connected loop geometry, the number of studies between (T 1 and T 2 , T 1 and T 3 , T 1 and T 4 , T 2 and T 3 , T 2 and T 4 , T 3 and T 4 )</head><p>were set at (1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 15), respectively.</p><p>Using the parameters described above, binary data were generated from an appropriate binomial distribution. Then, the hierarchical Bayesian NMA model was fitted to perform statistical inference. In each MCMC simulation, the first 5,000 iterations were discarded as a burn-in to minimize the effect of initial values on the posterior distribution. Moreover, to minimize poor mixing (or slow convergence), chains were thinned by keeping every tenth simulated draw from each MCMC sequence. After burn-in and thinning, 2,000 iterations were used to estimate posterior distributions and make inferences about rank probabilities. For each simulation setting, this process was repeated 1,000 times. Convergence was assessed using the Brooks-Rubin diagnostic test where a potential scale reduction factor of 1.05 or lower was considered sufficient for convergence. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">41</ref> The first rank probability estimates yielded from the MCMC process were averaged over the 1,000 simulations for each setting to create mean first rank probabilities. Two measures of performance, the bias for estimates of first rank probabilities and the standard deviation of the estimates over 1,000 samples, were calculated. In this section, estimates of the mean, bias, and standard deviation of first rank probabilities for each simulation setting are given. For the first two sets of success probabilities, no difference between the average first rank probabilities of T 2 , T 3 , and T 4 were expected. <ref type="table">Table 4</ref> shows results for a star geometry. For an equal number of studies per comparison, the star geometry identified treatments as expected with minimal bias. However, with an unequal number of studies per comparison, the star geometry showed large bias and large standard deviation. The upward bias of the first rank probability corresponds to the treatment with the smallest number of studies in the network. All possible permutations of the unbalanced number of studies were checked and showed that the overestimation of the first rank probability always aligns with the treatment used in the fewest number of studies. <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 5</ref> shows results for the loop geometry. Here, T 3 was consistently underestimated, albeit slightly, though it was expected to be equivalent in efficacy with T 2 and T 4 .</p><p>In order to determine the impact of direct evidence, an additional simulation was conducted using a complete network. When direct evidence was available for all treatment comparisons, the model correctly estimated the ranks of treatments. These results are provided in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 6</ref>.</p><p>The results from the one closed loop geometry are provided in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 7</ref>. As with the loop geometry, the rank probability of T 3 was underestimated while those of T 2 and T 4 were overestimated. The underestimation by the one closed loop configuration was more extreme than with the loop configuration. This appears to be related to the additional direct evidence in the one closed loop configuration; T 3 was compared with T 1 , T 2 , and T 4 as opposed to only T 2 and T 4 in loop geometry. <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 8</ref> displays the results of when the position of the reference treatment for the one closed loop network geometry was changed. This result shows that T 4 , the treatment that was compared only with the placebo, was favored as compared to the other two equivalent treatments, which were compared to one another. <ref type="table">Table 9</ref> shows results for the ladder geometry. The first rank probability for T 3 was underestimated as with the loop geometry, with even stronger bias. <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 10</ref> shows results for the final scenario, when T 4 is superior in efficacy compared to three equally less effective treatments. Here, as expected, T 4 was identified by the model under each simulation setting as the most effective treatment with highest rank probability, regardless of the network geometry or placement of the superior treatment within it. The impact of the number of studies on the rank probability was negligible. In this scenario, bias and standard deviations were generally very small in all cases. The results were presented with a sample size of 50 for the star network pattern since the results were not markedly different for other network configurations or sample sizes, regardless of the position of the superior treatment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>NMA offers a set of methods to model, visualize, analyze, and interpret a comprehensive picture of the evidence involving multiple treatments and to understand the relative merits of each intervention.

The primary purpose of this article was to examine the effect of various factors on rank probabilities of treatments in NMA through simulation. For the treatments compared in loop, one closed loop, and ladder network structures with an equal number of studies per comparison, the model-estimated rank probabilities exhibited bias. The model favored the treatment that was directly compared with the fewest number of treatments in the network patterns.

Treatments that are compared directly with inferior treatments yield ranks that are overestimated, while treatments that are exclusively compared with equal or superior treatments yield ranks that are underestimated. When there is an unequal number of studies per comparison for a given network structure, the model overestimated the rank probability of the treatment associated with smaller number of studies. The first rank probability's overestimation when it is the least-studied treatment is an artifact of a larger estimated variance for that treatment. The rank probabilities obtained from Bayesian NMA for loop, one closed loop, and ladder geometry can be reliable only when there is direct evidence for every treatment involved in the analysis or when there is an obvious superiority in efficacy. In other words, rank estimates for treatments that have never been directly compared should not be trusted. The position of the reference treatment in the network may affect conclusions from rank probabilities. Increasing the sample size of individual studies did not help to adjust the over/underestimation of the rank probabilities. These findings validate the concerns of Mills et al 24 about using rank probabilities for decision making.</p><p>There are some limitations of this simulation that must be noted. Although the Bayesian NMA model can be used broadly, only a binary outcome was considered in this simulation study. This study was also confined to only two-arm studies. In practice, multi-arm studies in NMA are often encountered where correlation is induced among contrasts that involve a common comparator and must be modeled. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">42</ref> Furthermore, this study only focused on the rank probabilities that each treatment is best, but the authors might be interested in investigating all of the ranks of available treatments. <ref type="table">Table 9</ref> Ladder network pattern success probabilities (0.1, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5) and n=200 <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Bias  Standard deviation   T 1  T 2  T 3  T 4  T 1  T 2  T 3  T 4  T 1  T 2  T 3  T 4</ref> (   <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">3)</ref> 0.00 0.00 0.00 1.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">5)</ref> 0.00 0.00 0.00 1.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">10)</ref> 0.00 0.00 0.00 1.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">15)</ref> 0.00 0.00 0.00 1.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">15)</ref> 0.00 0.00 0.00 1.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.01 0.00 0.01 <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1)</ref> 0.00 0.00 0.00 1.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>This simulation study revealed several occasions of bias of rank probabilities obtained from a Bayesian NMA. For example, for an unequal number of studies per comparison, the rank probability of the treatment with more studies was underestimated. In addition, the rank probability of the treatment that was directly compared with the placebo and an equivalent treatment simultaneously (eg, T 2 and T 4 in loop, ladder, and one closed loop geometries) gained spurious rank probabilities, whereas the rank probability of a treatment that was compared with two equivalent treatments (eg, T 3 in loop, ladder, and one closed loop) was underestimated. In summary, decisions should not be made based on rank probabilities especially when treatments are not directly compared (ie, ladder, one closed loop, star) as they may be ill-informed. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>network configuration.</figDesc></figure>
