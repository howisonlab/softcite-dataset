			<abstract>
				<p>von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL) patients develop highly vascular tumors, including central nervous system hemangioblastomas. It has been hypothesized that the vascular nature of these tumors is the product of reactive angiogenesis. However, recent data indicate that VHL-associated hemangioblastoma neoplastic cells originate from embryologically-arrested hemangioblasts capable of blood and endothelial cell differentiation. To determine the origin of tumor vasculature in VHL-associated hemangioblastomas, we analyzed the vascular elements in tumors from VHL patients. We demonstrate that isolated vascular structures and blood vessels within VHL-associated hemangioblastomas are a result of tumor-derived vasculogenesis. Further, similar to hemangioblastomas, we demonstrate that other VHL-associated lesions possess vascular tissue of tumor origin and that tumor-derived endothelial cells emerge within implanted VHL deficient UMRC6 RCC murine xenografts. These findings further establish the embryologic, developmentally arrested, hemangioblast as the tumor cell of origin for VHL-associated hemangioblastomas and indicate that it is also the progenitor cell for other VHL-associated tumors. v on Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL) is a progressive multi-system familial tumor syndrome characterized by phenotypically similar vascular tumors in the central nervous system (CNS) and viscera 1. Characteristic VHL neoplasms include CNS hemangioblastomas, endolymphatic sac tumors, renal cell carcinomas (RCCs), pheochromocytomas and pancreatic cystadenomas 1. VHL is caused by a germline mutation in the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor gene (VHL) located on the short arm of chromosome 3 (3p25-26) 2. Tumor development occurs after loss of the wild-type allele (loss of heterozygosity [LOH]) 3-6. While this second-hit is somatic and varies between different tumors in VHL 7 , it takes place within a susceptible cell type in an at risk organ system during embryogenesis and results in a consistent tumor phenotype 8-10. Shared tumor characteristics in VHL can be attributed to a decrease in the production of functional VHL protein (pVHL) in affected tumor cells. pVHL is necessary for the degradation of hypoxia inducible factors ([HIF] HIF-1a and HIF-2a), which in response to tissue hypoxia play a significant role in cellular metabolism, growth and proliferation, as well as induction of angiogenesis and erythropoiesis through the production of downstream factors (e.g., vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF], platelet derived growth factor [PDGF], erythropoietin [EPO], and endothelin [EDN1]) 1,11-13. Data suggest that constitutively upregulated HIF activity drives the development and progression of the vascular tumors characteristically found in VHL patients 1,13. Recently, the hemangioblast cell has been identified as giving rise to VHL-associated CNS hemangioblastomas 8-10,14. Hemangioblast cells are identified by the co-expression of brachyury, Flk-1, and Scl/Tal1 15-17. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting by known hemangioblast markers (Tie2 hi c-Kit 1 CD41 2) in vitro yields both endothelial cells and erythrocytes 18,19. Moreover, VHL-associated tumor cells can evoke blood island formation and differentiate into erythrocytes in vitro and in vivo, as well as form endothelial cell progeny in vitro 8,10. These findings indicate that VHL-associated hemangioblastomas are not only capable of extramedullary hematopoiesis but potentially blood vessel development. It had been hypothesized that extensive blood vessel formation in VHL-associated tumors was exclusively the result of reactive angiogenesis within a pseudo-hypoxic (pVHL deficient) cellular environment, and secondary to HIF-induced downstream factor production (VEGF, PDGF, EPO, and END1) 1,13. However, the discovery of the multipotent hemangioblast as the neoplastic cell in hemangioblastomas suggested that de novo formation of new blood vessels directly through stem-like endothelial progenitor cells (hemangioblast cells) could play a role in</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>To define the vascular features of CNS hemangioblastomas, we systematically examined hemangioblastomas resected from 6 VHL patients and compared the features to normal cerebellum and spinal cord collected at autopsy from 5 patients with VHL and 3 non-VHL controls. CD31 expression, an endothelial specific cell surface marker, highlighted extensive vascular tissue within hemangioblastoma tumors (in contrast with normal cerebellum) ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1a,b</ref>). Hemangioblastoma precursors (defined by CA9 and HIF-2a expression in the absence of HIF-1a expression) <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> were identified within regions of normal cerebellar tissue in autopsy samples from patients with VHL ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1c,d,e</ref>). Both hemangioblastomas and precursor lesions demonstrated the presence of numerous small (10 to 50 micron diameter) unperfused CD31 expressing ring-like vascular structures, indicative of sprouting vessel development with lumen formation <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 1b,f)</ref>.</p><p>To better understand the anatomic relationship of the small unperfused intratumoral vascular structures and characterize the three-dimensional (3D) structure of vasculature in VHL-associated tumor, we performed serial-section 3D immunohistochemical analysis of vessels in tumor. Examination of 3D CD31 expression reconstruction in tumors demonstrated the formation of numerous small isolated islands of vascular tissue (10 to 50 microns) independent from the established vascular network ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1G</ref>). To further define potential differences within the vasculature of VHL-associated tumors, we analyzed hemangioblastoma-associated vessels according to size. Immunohistochemical analysis showed larger vessels (greater than 100 microns) expressed Factor VIII with or without CD31 expression, while small vascular structures almost exclusively expressed CD31. Consistent with previous studies, the absence of Factor VIII expression and pronounced CD31 expression in small vascular structures confirmed the presence of immature proliferative endothelial cells within hemangioblastoma tumors ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2a)</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> .</p><p>To definitively establish the origin of the small unperfused vascular structures, tissue micro-dissection and extraction was performed of CD31 staining endothelial cells from hemangioblastomas, as previously described <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 2b)</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> . Dissected vascular elements demonstrated marked allelic imbalance, confirming LOH <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 2b,c</ref>). Blood cell samples and large tumor feeding vessels did not exhibit LOH ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2c</ref>). To further confirm this result, FISH with concurrent CD31 immunofluorescence was carried out on hemangioblastoma sections to detect the presence or absence of VHL itself. Endothelial cell nuclei within larger vessels (100 microns) displayed retention of both copies of VHL <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 2d</ref>). Alternatively, small vascular elements (10 to 50 microns) showed one copy of VHL, indicating loss of the wild-type allele ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2e,f,g</ref>). Complementary LOH and FISH data served to verify that tumor-derived vasculogenesis was taking place within evaluated hemangioblastoma tumors. Large vascular structures also demonstrated some endothelial cells with loss of one copy of VHL, consistent with migrating endothelial cells that were recruited during angiogenesis combining with developing de novo endothelial cells during tumor blood vessel formation.</p><p>To determine if vessels in other VHL-associated tumors were tumor-derived, we examined vascular elements in other VHL-associated lesions collected at autopsy from 5 VHL patients. Micro-dissected endothelial cells from RCCs, kidney cysts, and pancreatic tumors demonstrated characteristic VHL LOH in comparison to non-tumor control vessels <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. 3a,b</ref>). To assess the process of VHL-associated tumor vessel formation in vivo, subcutaneous implanted UMRC6 (RCC cell-line with VHL deletion) xenografts in NOD. Cg-Prkdc scid Il2rg tm1Wjl /SzJ mice were surgically extracted at 2 weeks and intratumoral vasculogenesis was analyzed ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3c</ref>). UMRC6 xenografts presumably demonstrated characteristic VHLassociated tumor phenotype with extensive vascularity and clear-cell appearance ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3d,e</ref>). Small vascular structures developing within xenograft lesions were identified by CD31 staining and extracted by micro-dissection ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3f)</ref>. Micro-dissected structures demonstrated human genomic (DNA) marker after amplification with VHL-flanking chromosome 3 specific primers (D3S1038 and D3S1110), as opposed to control murine muscle tissue that did not amplify <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. 3g</ref>). Co-localization by immunofluorescence of human specific HLA markers and non-specific CD31 within the xenografts further established the presence of tumor-derived endothelial cells emerging within the tumor, and indicate that the hemangioblast is presumably the tumor cell of origin in VHL-associated tumors other than hemangioblastomas <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. 3h</ref>,i,j,k).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The hemangioblast cell has been identified as the embryologic progenitor cell for both endothelial cells and erythrocytes and proposed as the neoplastic progenitor cell in hemangioblastomas <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> . These data demonstrate that VHL-associated neoplastic cells maintain the potential to differentiate into endothelial cells, giving direct rise to some tumor blood vessel development. This result should not be confused with recently demonstrated trans-differentiation in glioblastoma and the development of tumor-derived endothelial cells and perictyes <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> . The intra-and extra-embryonic mesodermally derived hemangioblast is the origin of coupled vasculogenesis and primitive erythrocyte formation during embryogenesis within the yolk sac and dorsal root of the aorta respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> . Therefore, it is not difficult to conceive that tumors arising from the developmentally arrested hemangioblast are capable of endothelial differentiation.</p><p>Tumor progenitor hemangioblasts and RCC tumor cells, of which 90% of sporadic cases possess biallelic VHL inactivation, are unable to degrade HIF <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> . Overexpression of HIF and downstream gene activation plays an important role in tumor proliferation, invasion, and angiogenesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> . In line with previous reports, our findings indicate that the embryologically arrested pVHL-deficient hemangioblast is the neoplastic progenitor cell in VHL-associated hemangioblastomas and that it also serves as the progenitor cell for other VHL-associated tumors (RCC). Furthermore, based upon both previous and current data, we propose that pVHL-deficient tumor cells develop and progress secondary to constitutively produced proangiogenic factors (VEGF, PDGF, EPO, and EDN1) that stimulate endothelial cell and erythrocyte differentiation, while also inducing angiogenesis within the existent tumor vascular network <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 4a,b)</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> . In addition, de novo endothelial cells can combine with migrating endothelial cells recruited during angiogenesis during tumor blood vessel formation <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 4c)</ref>. However, at this time we cannot separate integrated tumor-derived endothelial cells from those derived during angiogenesis in terms of function. An in-depth understanding of   Immunohistochemistry staining. Tissues were fixed in Histochoice (Amresco) with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Research Products International). Detection of antibody was performed using the Vectastain ABC reagent (1550) and DAB (Vector Laboratories). Sections were counterstained with Mayer's hematoxylin (Sigma-Aldrich). Primary antibodies were as follows: anti-CD31 (15200, Dako).</p><p>Immunofluorescence staining and flourescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Slides were fixed with Histochoice (Amresco) and labeled overnight with primary antibodies. Nuclei of cells were counterstained with DAPI (Sigma-Aldrich). Staining was visualized with a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss). Primary antibodies were as follows: anti-factor VIII (15200, Sigma-Aldrich), anti-CD31 (15200, Dako), and anti-HLA Class I ABC (15200, MBL International). For interphase FISH analysis, BAC clone RP11-438J1 (210 kb) including the entire VHL gene from the 3p25.3 region was used. The VHL BAC DNA probe labeled by SpectrumOrange was purchased from Empire Genomics. Centromere enumeration probe for chromosome 3 (CEP3) labeled with SpectrumGreen was purchased from Abbott Molecular. FISH assays were performed on 5 micron Formalin-Fixed-Paraffin-Embedded (FFPE) tumor sections using laboratory standardized protocol with slight modification <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> . Denaturation of target DNA on slides was carried out by co-denaturation of the probe and target DNA at 73uC in HYBrite (Abbott Molecular) for 5 min followed by overnight hybridization at 37uC. The next day, slides were washed at 72uC in 0.43 SSC/0.3% Tween-20 for 2 min and then in 23 SSC/0.1% Tween-20 at room temperature for 1 min. Slides were counterstained, mounted with DAPI/Antifade (Vector Laboratories) and analyzed on the BioView Duet-3 fluorescent scanning station using 633 oil objective and DAPI/FITC/Rhodamine single band filters (Semrock).</p><p>Three-dimensional immunohistochemistry. Serial sections were cut at 8.0-mm thickness. After staining (anti-CD31), individual micrographs were collected and stacked. Images were captured using a Yokogawa spinning-disk confocal on a Nikon TE2000U inverted microscope with a 1003 Plan Apo NA 1.4 objective lens, a Hamamatsu ORCA ER-cooled CCD camera, and MetaMorph software. Image stacks were aligned, analyzed, and visualized using freeware Reconstruct software (SynapseWeb).</p><p>DNA extraction and loss of heterozygosity testing. Tissue dissection was performed as previously described <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> .

Human renal cell carcinoma cell line UMRC6 was maintained in Dulbecco's modified essential medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and Insulin-Transferrin-Selenium-Ethanolamine (Gibco). Animal experiments were approved for use and care of animals under the protocol guidelines of the National Institutes of Health Animal Care and Use Committee. NOD. Cg-Prkdc scid Il2rg tm1Wjl /SzJ mice (aged 6 to 8-wk, male) were purchased from Jackson Laboratories. 10 7 UMRC6 cells in 200 mL PBS were injected subcutaneously. Tumors were excised and processed for morphological study two weeks after initial implantation. (hemangioblasts) in VHL-associated hemangioblastoma, unable to degrade HIF, produce downstream factors vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet derived growth factor, erythropoietin, and endothelin secondary to pseudo-hypoxic cellular environment (A). HIF-dependent factor release stimulates hemangioblastoma tumor cells to differentiate into erythrocytes or endothelial cells, while also inducing angiogenesis within the existent tumor vascular network (B). De novo endothelial cells (V, vasculogenesis) can combine with migrating endothelial cells (A, angiogenesis), recruited during angiogenesis, during tumor blood vessel formation (C).</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 |</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Characterization of VHL-associated CNS hemangioblastoma tumor vasculature.
