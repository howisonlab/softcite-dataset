			<abstract>
				<p>Transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) can be a challenging procedure for an inexperienced surgeon. We suggest an easy technique for TURBT, which we have named the &quot;grasp and bite&quot; technique. We describe this technique and compare its effectiveness and safety with that of conventional TURBT. Materials and Methods: Monopolar TURBT (24-Fr Karl Storz) was performed in 35 patients who had superficial bladder tumors. After defining the tumor margin, the tumor and surrounding mucosa were grasped by use of a loop electrode and resectoscope sheath. With tight grasping, linear moving resection was performed. The patients&apos; demographic, intraoperative, and postoperative data were analyzed between the conventional and grasp and bite TURBT groups. Results: Of 35 patients, 16 patients underwent conventional TURBT (group 1), and the other 19 patients underwent grasp and bite TURBT (group 2). Both groups were similar in age, tumor multiplicity, size, anesthesia method, and location. Grasp and bite TURBT could be performed as safely and effectively as conventional TURBT. There were no significant differences in irrigation duration, urethral catheterization, postoperative hemoglobin drop, or length of hospital stay. No significant side effects such as bladder perforation, severe obturator reflex, or persistent bleeding occurred. There were no significant pathological differences between specimens according to the type of resection technique. Conclusions: The grasp and bite TURBT technique was feasible for superficial bladder tumors. It may be a good tool for inexperienced surgeons owing to its convenient and easy manner.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Patients</head><p>This was a retrospective study in the Department of Urology of Chonnam National University Hospital (Gwangju, Korea) between January 2012 and April 2013. This study included a total of 29 men and 6 women who had bladder tumors with superficial lesions and who underwent TURBT. Patients with a huge unresectable mass, an invasive tumor shown during preoperative imaging, or an irradiated bladder were excluded.

Group 1 patients were treated by use of the conventional TURBT technique, and group 2 patients underwent the grasp and bite technique. We applied each technique during a distinct time period. Conventional TURBT was performed in 2012 and grasp and bite TURBT was performed in 2013. All procedures were performed by a single experienced operator. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Chonnam National University Hospital (IRB No. CNUH-2014-025).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">TURBT technique</head><p>Transurethral resection was performed with a monopolar resectoscope system (24-Fr Karl Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany). For the grasp and bite technique, the operator initially defined the tumor morphology and safe margin. In small and f lat lesions, the tumor and surrounding mucosal lesions were positioned between the resection loop and the end portion of the resectoscope sheath. The resectoscope sheath was then moved backward carefully. The tumor could be held tightly with the loop electrode and sheath. We call this the "grasp" step ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>; Video clip, Supplementary material). Using the grasping technique, the tumor lesions were lifted up. In the "bite" step, the surgeon maintained a tight hold and resected the tumor while grasping. A cystoscopic view and schematic illustrations are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>. For resection during the bite step, the movement of the electrode loop was straight backward in a linear direction. Resection was performed carefully so as not to cause bladder perforation without excessive bladder wall distention. Poorly located tumors were accessed by suprapubic pressure and nearly emptying the bladder. When necessary, cold cup biopsy was done at the tumor base and edges. The resection site was carefully inspected for bleeding and coagulation. In bulky or pedunculated tumors, the protruding mass was resected rapidly with the grasp and bite technique. After removal of the bulging mass, the base lesion and surrounding mucosa were resected carefully by using grasp and bite TURBT as mentioned earlier. Also, the tumor margin could be resected in the same manner repeatedly.</p><p>Resected specimens were reviewed by a pathologist to Values are presented as number (%) unless otherwise indicated.

From January to April 2013, the grasp and bite technique was applied to 19 patients with superficial bladder tumors. Tumors ranged in size from 0.5 to 5 cm. The two groups had comparable demographic and intraoperative data, including patient age, tumor size, patient gender, multiplicity, tumor mor phology, and tumor location ( <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1)</ref>.</p><p>The mean operative time was similar in the conventional and grasp and bite groups (35 minutes vs. 35 minutes, <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>.

(B) Muscularis mucosae bundles stained intensely with smoothelin (×40). Novel TURBT technique respectively). The mean duration of irrigation, duration of catheterization, and hospital stay were not significantly different between the groups. Hemoglobin change and complication rates were also comparable between the two groups. There were no cases of bladder perforation, excessive obturator reflex, or persistent hematuria in either group. The tumor stages and grades were similar in the two groups. Specimens were adequate for accurate pathological staging of the muscularis mucosae. H&amp;E staining and smoothelin immunohistochemistry positivity identified the muscularis mucosae in the grasp and bite group <ref type="figure">(Fig. 2</ref>). There was no significant difference in recurrence rates between the conventional and grasp and bite TURBT groups during the 14-month follow-up (43.8% vs. 31.6%, p=0.458). The detailed postoperative outcomes are given in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>The purpose of TURBT is complete removal of all visible tumors for curative intent and acquisition of adequate tissue for pathologic evaluation. Achievement of the above purposes is not so easy for an inexperienced surgeon. Also, tumor recurrence after TURBT is relatively high. For non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer, the probability of recurrence after 1 year ranges from 15% to 70% <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>. Many obstacles can arise during the procedure, such as bladder perforation, bleeding, obturator reflex, and damage to the ureteral orifices. To overcome these difficulties, many surgical techniques and innovative devices have been developed. For example, endoscopic snare resection of a bladder tumor can be used to remove pedunculated tumors <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Although the snare method offers the advantage of en block resection, smaller and sessile tumors are not suitable for this technique. New devices such as water jet hydrodissection and the thulium:yttrium aluminium garnet laser may be applicable for en block resection of superf icial tumors <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>. However, further studies and development of these techniques are necessary to determine efficacy and oncologic outcomes.</p><p>Variable methods of tumor resection have been devel op ed and used in association with tumor size and location. These also are determined by a surgeon's preference and surgical experience. Modifications of TURBT equipment and techniques also have the possibility of improving surgical out comes. Accurate surgical technique is mandatory for dealing with safety and efficacy issues. Innovative re secto scope modifications have also been developed. The sideto-side bidirectional lateral rotating handgrip and loop allows excellent precision and control over the loop under direct vision <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Loop modification, the so-called "runner," can push the bladder wall away during resection, thereby widening the view and decreasing the risk of perforation <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. We developed an easy and safe technique for an inexperienced operator. We wanted a technique in which we could use a conventional resectoscope and loop without accessory equipment.</p><p>When using a wire-loop resectoscope, the tumor must be resected thoroughly to obtain adequate muscle tissue. The movement of the loop is somewhat fast and deep to avoid charring of the surrounding mucosa and bladder perforation <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. These are key technique of TURBT, but not so easy to perform. Our technique has the merit of acquiring adequate tissue. Direct pressure to the bladder wall may allow deeper tissue to protrude into the bladder wall and then be easily removed by use of the resectoscope. Instead of the curvilinear movement of the resectoscope end according to the curved bladder surface, the easy linear motion can make a curved resection with grasping. Using our "grasp and bite" technique, beginners can easily perform TURBT safely. Often, small and sessile tumors are missed and severely damaged during resection and cauterization. The grasp and bite technique can effectively be applied to small, flat, sessile lesions. For larger tumors, the protruding tumor can be removed f irst by the conventional method, and then the stalk and base lesion can be removed by the grasp and bite technique. Poorly accessible tumors are difficult for complete resection. In theory, the grasp and bite technique could have difficulties in a posterior or posterolateral located tumor because of its moving mechanism. In our series, two posterior and four posterolateral tumors were successfully accessed by use of suprapubic pressure and nearly emptying the bladder. Similar to conventional TURBT, it was also difficult to access posterior tumors with the grasp and bite method.</p><p>In our consecutive cases, obturator reflex was not problematic. There were no cases of excessive obturator reflex or bladder perforation in either group. General anesthesia was preferred in the conventional and grasp and bite groups (81.3% vs 57.3%, p=0.138). Also, tumor locations did not differ significantly between the two groups (p=0.253). We postulated that the grasping method, which lifts the tissue away from the obturator nerve and tightly holds the grasped tissue, may eventually weaken the reflex. Considering this small population, however, we cannot make conclusions and need to f urther study a larger population.</p><p>This study had some limitations that may have limited the conclusions. First, the two groups were classif ied by the date of operation. Thus, there could have been a selection bias. Also, the study population was small, and thus we were unable to perform statistical analysis of the oncologic outcome as recurrence-free survival. This was a preliminary study to develop a surgical technique performed by an experienced surgeon. Larger prospective studies with a long f ollow-up period will be necessary to show the oncologic advantage of this technique. To determine the feasibility of the technique for inexperienced surgeons, future study will address a teaching protocol comparing the conventional and grasp and bite methods. Owing to the nature of retrospective research, histologic information was not fully acquired.</p><p>Investigation of tissue adequacy of proper muscle and effect of coagulation will be our next subject of study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSIONS</head><p>Our study demonstrated that grasp and bite TURBT is a safe and effective method for removing superficial bladder tumors. This technique has merit for flat tumors and can also be used for pedunculated and poorly accessible tumors. The grasp and bite method may be a shortcut for overcoming the difficulties of TURBT.</p></div>
