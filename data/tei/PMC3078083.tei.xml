				<p>Fusion of mononucleated myoblasts to form multinucleated myofibers is an essential phase of skeletal myogenesis, which occurs during muscle development as well as during postnatal life for muscle growth, turnover, and regeneration. Many cell adhesion proteins, including integrins, have been shown to be important for myoblast fusion in vertebrates, and recently focal adhesion kinase (FAK), has been proposed as a key mediator of myoblast fusion. Here we focused on the possible role of PKCθ, the PKC isoform predominantly expressed in skeletal muscle, in myoblast fusion. We found that the expression of PKCθ is strongly up-regulated following freeze injury-induced muscle regeneration, as well as during in vitro differentiation of satellite cells (SCs; the muscle stem cells). Using both PKCθ knockout and muscle-specific PKCθ dominant-negative mutant mouse models, we observed delayed body and muscle fiber growth during the first weeks of postnatal life, when compared with wild-type (WT) mice. We also found that myofiber formation, during muscle regeneration after freeze injury, was markedly impaired in PKCθ mutant mice, as compared with WT. This phenotype was associated with reduced expression of the myogenic differentiation program executor, myogenin, but not with that of the SC marker Pax7. Indeed in vitro differentiation of primary muscle-derived SCs from PKCθ mutants resulted in the formation of thinner myotubes with reduced numbers of myonuclei and reduced fusion rate, when compared with WT cells. These effects were associated to reduced expression of the profusion genes caveolin-3 and β1D integrin and to reduced activation/phosphorylation of their upstream regulator FAK. Indeed the exogenous expression of a constitutively active mutant form of PKCθ in muscle cells induced FAK phosphorylation. Moreover pharmacologically mediated full inhibition of FAK activity led to similar fusion defects in both WT and PKCθ-null myoblasts. We thus propose that PKCθ signaling regulates myoblast fusion by regulating, at least in part, FAK activity, essential for profusion gene expression.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>PKCθ signaling is required for myoblast fusion by regulating the expression of caveolin-3 and β1D integrin upstream focal adhesion kinase INTRODUCTION During muscle development, myoblasts (the muscle-committed cell population) fuse together to form muscle fibers. When the muscle is built, postnatal muscle growth and regeneration are guaranteed by satellite cells (SCs), the muscle stem cells, recognized as located between the basal lamina and the sarcolemma, and expressing the SC marker Pax7; these cells are able to recapitulate myogenesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Holterman and Rudnicki, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Le and Rudnicki, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Kuang and Rudnicki, 2008)</ref>. A large number of factors regulate muscle precursor differentiation. Pax7-positive cells must escape from their stem cell program through the activation of myogenin and MRF4, which regulate the expression of muscle-specific protein to build the contractile apparatus. An initial phase of myoblast fusion (primary fusion) is required to form nascent myofibers. A secondary fusion cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Sun et al., 2000)</ref> and the mPKCθK/R transgenic model, in which a dominant-negative mutant form of PKCθ is expressed under the control of a muscle-specific promoter <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Serra et al., 2003)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Lack of PKCθ delays mouse growth</head><p>We initially observed that juvenile mice lacking PKCθ appeared smaller than age-and sex-matched WT mice. We thus systematically measured body weight of PKCθ −/at different ages during postnatal growth, as compared with that of age-and sex-matched WT mice. As shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 1A</ref>, during the first 4-5 wk of age, the body weight of PKCθ −/mice was significantly lower than that of WT mice, raising the level of WT body weight only by 5-8 wk. Because skeletal muscle is the tissue that contributes most to body weight, we aimed to verify whether the observed decrease in body weight was due to reduction in skeletal muscle mass. As first, lack of PKCθ expression in skeletal muscles (tibialis anterior <ref type="bibr">[TA]</ref> and extensor digitorum longus <ref type="bibr">[EDL]</ref>) of the mutant mice was confirmed by Western blot analysis ( <ref type="figure">Figure 1A)</ref>. Indeed muscle mass, as well as muscle fiber size, of 2-mo-old PKCθ −/hind limb was apparently reduced, as compared with that of WT ( <ref type="figure">Figure 1B)</ref>. In fact, morphometric analysis of TA muscle showed that muscle fiber cross-sectional area (CSA) was reduced in PKCθ −/with respect to WT during the first weeks of postnatal life ( <ref type="figure">Figure 1B</ref>), whereas no significant differences were observed in the total number of fibers (unpublished data). By 3 mo, however, muscle fiber CSA in PKCθ −/was similar to that of WT mice ( <ref type="figure">Figure 1B</ref>), suggesting that lack of PKCθ −/delayed postnatal mouse growth, mostly by delaying postnatal skeletal muscle fiber growth.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Lack of PKCθ impairs muscle regeneration in vivo</head><p>It is well known that postnatal muscle growth is due to SC (muscle stem cell) differentiation and fusion to preexisting muscle fibers, as well as to each other, to form new fibers. Thus the reduction in muscle mass and myofiber CSA observed during the first weeks of postnatal growth in PKCθ −/mice suggests that PKCθ may indeed be required for these processes. To verify this possibility, we first analyzed whether the expression and activation/phosphorylation of PKCθ was modulated in WT mice during muscle regeneration, a process which recapitulates muscle formation and growth. Muscle regeneration was induced by freeze injury in TA, and protein extracts from TA muscles, dissected at different periods of time (2, 4, and 7 d) after injury, were analyzed by Western blot. As shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 2A</ref>, PKCθ expression and phosphorylation peaked in regenerating muscle 4-7 d after injury, thus during the period of major fusion and growth of regenerating fibers. Muscle regeneration was then induced in age-and sex-matched PKCθ −/-. Muscle reorganization was analyzed at morphological level, 4 d after injury when new myofibers started to form (unpublished data), and 7 d after injury, when most regenerating myofibers had formed but were still immature, and compared with WT regenerating muscle ( <ref type="figure">Figure 2B</ref>). Analysis of muscle sections revealed that muscle from mice in which PKCθ was deleted displayed, at both period of times, the characteristics of delayed regeneration, such as smaller regenerating centronucleated myofibers, heterogeneity in myofiber size, increased number of interstitial cells, and increased interstitial space between myofibers, as compared with time-matched regenerating WT muscle ( <ref type="figure">Figure 2B</ref>, a and b). In keeping with these observations at day 7, although the number of embryonic myosin heavy chain (eMyHC; used as a marker of regenerating myofibers) expressing myofibers in PKCθ −/mice was similar to that in WT mice ( <ref type="figure">Figure 2B</ref>, c and d), their median CSA was significantly smaller ( <ref type="figure">Figure 2B</ref>, e). As a result, wave (secondary fusion), involving recruitment of mononucleated cells to the nascent myofibers, then completes myofiber growth. Several molecules contribute to myoblast fusion, such as M-cadherin, neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM), β1D integrin, and caveolin 3. Among them, β1D integrin and caveolin 3 expression has been recently shown to be required for "secondary" myoblast fusion, because reduction of any of them dramatically impairs myoblast fusion; their expression appears to be regulated by focal adhesion kinase (FAK) signaling, which has thus been proposed as a key player in the fusion process <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Quach et al., 2009)</ref>.</p><p>Many studies suggested that PKC is one of the key intermediates in integrin-mediated signaling in many cell types <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Disatnik and Rando, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Mostafavi-Pour et al., 2003)</ref>. Indeed inhibition of PKC activity results in the inhibition of cell attachment and spreading as well as of FAK phosphorylation. PKCs may also directly phosphorylate focal adhesion proteins like talin and filamin <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Tigges et al., 2003)</ref>, allowing the interactions of integrins with the actin cytoskeleton. Moreover activation of PKC can promote the cellular changes mediated by integrin/matrix interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Disatnik and Rando, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Disatnik et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Connors et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Tulla et al., 2008)</ref>. These observations together demonstrate that PKC plays a specific role in integrin-mediated signal transduction. Because the PKC family of serine/threonine protein kinases comprises at least 12 isoforms, it is still unclear whether different PKC isoforms may play distinct and specific role. PKCs can be subdivided in three subgroups, according to their structure and enzymatic activity: the "conventional" PKCs (PKCα, β1, β2, and γ), the enzymatic activity of which is calcium and phospholipid dependent, the "novel" PKCs (δ, ε, η, θ, and μ/PKD), the activity of which is calcium independent but phospholipid dependent, and the "atypical" PKCs (ζ, ι/λ, and τ), the activity of which is calcium and phospholipidindependent. In skeletal muscle, PKCθ is the PKC isoform predominantly expressed <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Osada et al., 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Zappelli et al., 1996)</ref>. In lymphocytes, it acts as a key regulator in their activation and proliferation <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Pfeifhofer et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Manicassamy et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Boschelli, 2009)</ref>. We recently showed that it is also required for cardiomyocyte survival and cardiac remodeling <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Paoletti et al., 2010)</ref>. Its role in skeletal muscle is not as clear yet, however. We and others have shown that PKCθ expression in skeletal muscle is developmentally and nerve regulated, and that it mediates various cellular responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Hilgenberg et al., 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Zappelli et al., 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Serra et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">D'Andrea et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Gao et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Tokugawa et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Messina et al., 2010)</ref>. It is noteworthy that PKCθ starts to be expressed during the fetal period of development, when muscle mass is built, and it peaks during the first few weeks of postnatal life, when muscle mass needs to grow extensively <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Hilgenberg et al., 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Zappelli et al., 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Messina et al., 2010)</ref>, suggesting that PKCθ may be involved in skeletal muscle growth and remodeling. To test this hypothesis, experimentally induced muscle regeneration, which recapitulates most developmental and histogenetic events, may represent a reliable approach. Earlier studies have suggested that multiple PKC isoforms are implicated in muscle-regenerative process, acting differently in times and location and suggesting that individual isoform may fulfill distinct functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Moraczewski et al., 2002)</ref>. Indeed during regeneration, an earlier expression of PKCθ than of the other members of PKC was observed in rats <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Moraczewski et al., 2002)</ref>. More recently, restriction of PKCθ immunoreactivity in SCs was described in regenerating rat TA, suggesting a role in SC maintenance and/or activation <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Tokugawa et al., 2009)</ref>. We here aimed to investigate the role of PKCθ in muscle regeneration in vivo and SC differentiation in vitro, using two different models of PKCθ-null mice: a PKCθ knockout model, in which the PKCθ gene was inactivated in all after injury, muscle morphology seemed similar in control and PKCθ −/muscles, in terms of muscle fiber CSA and muscle organization (unpublished data), showing that there clearly are compensatory mechanisms that ultimately result in effective regeneration even if significantly delayed compared with control muscle.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Lack of PKCθ impairs in vitro myogenesis</head><p>To test whether PKCθ may regulate myoblast fusion, the expression and activation of PKCθ were analyzed in in vitro differentiating primary myoblasts derived from WT mice. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 3A</ref>, PKCθ expression was strongly up-regulated within 8 h in differentiation medium (DM), and most of the protein was associated to the particulate fraction, as a feature of PKC activation. In vitro differentiation of primary myoblasts derived from PKCθ mutant mice was then compared with that of WT myoblasts. The cells were fixed after 48 h in DM and were either stained with Wright's solution or immunostained with the anti-sarcomeric myosin heavy chain MF20 antibody. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 3B</ref>, by 48 h in DM, WT myoblasts had formed elongated myotubes containing a large number of nuclei; in contrast, PKCθ −/myoblasts exhibited minimal fusion. To quantify these observations, fusion rate was evaluated by counting the number of nuclei included in myosin-positive myotubes (containing ≥ 3 nuclei) divided by the total number of nuclei. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 3B</ref>, the fusion rate in PKCθ −/muscle cell cultures was almost 50% with respect to WT cells. To verify whether "secondary" myogenesis (addition of nuclei to already formed myotubes) was actually impaired, the number of nuclei per myotube was evaluated; as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 3B</ref>, the mean number of nuclei per myotube was significantly lower in PKCθnull cultures, as compared with WT. After culturing the cells for longer periods of time, the number of myotubes was approximately the same, as both cultures already reached the plateau stage by 48 h in DM. Fusion continued in both genotypes, but the fusion rate differences were still maintained (unpublished data). To verify whether similar defects may account for the reduced myofiber CSA observed in vivo, isolated myofibers were prepared from EDL muscle of 2-mo-old mice, and nuclei were counted by means of TO-PRO-3 staining. Nuclei included in myofiber-associated SCs were identified as located outside the sarcolemma. Indeed the number of nuclei in freshly isolated PKCθ −/myofibers was significantly lower than that in WT ones, whereas the number of SCs per myofiber was not altered (Figures 3C and Supplemental <ref type="figure">Figure S1</ref>).</p><p>To verify whether the in vitro observed defects might depend on different cell populations obtained from the two genotypes, the expression of alternative markers of muscle-specific resident precursors, such as PW1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Mitchell et al., 2010)</ref>, as well as markers of early or middle stages of myogenesis, such as MyoD and desmin, was the amount of eMyHC content in PKCθ −/regenerating muscle was significantly lower than that in WT. In fact, Western blot analysis revealed that, whereas in WT muscle eMyHC expression was increasing by the time of regeneration, in PKCθ −/its expression increased at 4 d after injury, but then it did not further increase ( <ref type="figure">Figure 2C</ref>). To verify whether the observed alterations in muscle regeneration were due to impairment of SCs activation and/or differentiation, the expression of the SC marker Pax7 and of the myogenic differentiation executor myogenin was analyzed by Western blot. As shown in <ref type="figure">Figure</ref> 2C, Pax7 expression was highly increased in both mutant and WT mice at day 4 after injury, at a similar extent, and then decreased by day 7 similarly in both mutant and WT mice. In contrast, the strong up-regulation of myogenin expression in WT mice at day 4 after injury was prevented in PKCθ −/mice; moreover the following down-regulation observed in WT mice 7 d after injury, as an indicator of the resolution of the differentiation process, was not observed in PKCθ −/-, where the level of expression of myogenin was only slightly lower than that observed at day 4 after injury.

Most of the clones derived from WT myoblasts, however, had formed elongated myotubes containing a large number of nuclei; in contrast, clones derived from PKCθ-null cells exhibited minimal fusion, similar to the nonclonally derived primary cultures ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 4B</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Lack of PKCθ prevents β1D integrin and caveolin-3 up-regulation during myoblast differentiation</head><p>On the basis of these results, we thus analyzed the expression of factors regulating myogenesis, during in vitro differentiation of PKCθ-null myoblasts, as compared with WT. Similar to what was observed during regeneration in vivo, Western blot analysis revealed that the expression of Pax7 was high in both PKCθ −/and WT cells cultured in GM, as well as after 1 d in DM; after 2 d in DM, the expression of Pax7 was almost undetectable in both PKCθ −/and WT cells ( <ref type="figure">Figure 5A</ref>). In contrast, the expression of myogenin, following similar time-course kinetics in both genotypes, was lower in mutant cells with respect to WT cells, at all the time points considered ( <ref type="figure">Figure 5A)</ref>. Surprisingly, the expression level of muscle-specific genes, such as sarcomeric myosin, was similar in PKCθ −/and WT differentiated cells ( <ref type="figure">Figure 5A</ref>). In contrast, the expected up-regulation of both β1D integrin and caveolin-3 expression, recently shown to be essential for myoblast fusion <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Quach et al., 2009)</ref>, observed in WT myoblasts after 1 d in DM, was significantly reduced in PKCθ −/myoblasts To confirm the requirement of PKCθ for myoblast fusion using a different approach, primary myoblasts were prepared from a different mouse model, the mPKCθK/R mouse <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Serra et al., 2003)</ref>, in which the expression of a kinase dead mutant form of PKCθ cDNA is driven by the muscle-specific enhancer of the desmin promoter; thus the activity of PKCθ is selectively inhibited in differentiating myoblasts. mPKCθK/R myoblasts behaved similarly to the PKCθ −/ones at the morphological level, giving rise to thin, oligonucleated myotubes in culture (unpublished data). Accordingly, the expression of β1D integrin and caveolin-3 was prevented at day 1 in DM, as compared with WT myoblasts <ref type="figure">(Figure 5B</ref>). At day 2 in DM, the expression level of β1D integrin and caveolin-3 in both PKCθ mutant cells was still reduced, although to a lesser extent, with respect to WT cells. Hoechst; bar = 100 μm.

As shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 6A</ref>, Western blot and immunofluorescence analyses revealed that lack of expression/activity of PKCθ significantly prevented FAK activation/phosphorylation during myoblast differentiation in vitro, as compared with WT myoblasts.

Parallel cultures were mock transfected. The ability of the exogenously expressed PKCθ mutant form to drive FAK phosphorylation was evaluated 16 h after transfection, by double immunofluorescence using the anti-phospho-FAK and the anti-PKCθ antibodies. As shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 6B</ref>, a-d, whereas no p-FAK-positive or PKCθ-positive cells were detectable in mock-transfected cells, all the PKCθ-expressing cells, in PKCθA/Etransfected cultures, coexpressed p-FAK. In parallel, another group of plates was processed for immunoprecipitation using the anti-FAK antibody. The immunoprecipitate was then analyzed by Western blot for p-FAK and for total FAK content. As shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 6B</ref>, increased FAK phosphorylation was observed in PKCθA/E-transfected cultures compared with mock-transfected cultures. To verify whether the observed decrease in FAK phosphorylation is the main event driving the phenotype, WT and PKCθ −/primary muscle cells were cultured in the presence of the FAK inhibitor 14 <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Beierle et al., 2010)</ref>, and both fusion rate and the number of nuclei per myotube were evaluated. As shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 6C</ref>, full FAK inhibition, by means of the inhibitor, strongly reduced fusion rate and number of nuclei per myotube in both WT and PKCθ −/cultures to a similar extent. Moreover upregulation of both β1D integrin and caveolin-3 was similarly prevented in both WT and PKCθ −/treated cells ( <ref type="figure">Figure 6D</ref>).</p></div>

(A) Western blot analysis of WT and PKCθ −/muscle-derived SCs, cultured in GM, or for different periods of time in DM, as indicated. Representative experiment is shown of three independent experiments. The blot was incubated with the α-Pax7, α-myogenin, α-sarcomeric myosin heavy chain, α-caveolin-3, and α-β1D integrin antibodies.

(B) Western blot analysis of WT and mPKCθK/R muscle-derived cells, cultured in GM, or for different periods of time in DM, as indicated. The blot was incubated with the α-caveolin-3 and α-β1D integrin antibodies. Densitometric analysis is shown at the bottom, WT (♦) and mPKCθK/R (), using the α-GAPDH antibody for normalization as in A ( ** p &lt; 0.01, *p &lt; 0.05 vs. WT). When significant, reduction of expression in PKCθ −/or in mPKCθK/R cells, expressed as percentage vs. WT (assumed as 100%) is also shown, resulting from at least three independent experiments. differentiation events. As first, lack of PKCθ in vivo resulted in reduced mice weight during the first weeks of postnatal life. The observed reduction was associated with reduction in both muscle mass and myofiber CSA. By 8-12 wk of postnatal life, both body weight and myofiber CSA in PKCθ −/mice were similar to those in WT mice, suggesting that lack of PKCθ delays the initial growth and building of the muscle mass. Indeed a reduction in lean muscle has previously been reported in PKCθ −/mice with respect to WT <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Gao et al., 2007)</ref>. The fact that PKCθ is required for muscle growth is further supported by the observed delay in muscle regeneration. Experimentally induced muscle regeneration is a valuable model to recapitulate myofiber differentiation and growth. We show in this article that PKCθ expression was strongly up-regulated 4 d after injury, just during the phase of muscle rebuilding. This observation is consistent with a previously published study that showed that PKCθ activity increased significantly during the final phases of muscle regeneration in rat <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Moraczewski et al., 2002)</ref>. Indeed we show that lack of PKCθ delayed muscle rebuilding after injury. The observed delay can be accounted for by impairment of the late phases of the growth/regeneration process. In fact, whereas no alteration in the expression of early markers of activated SCs, such as Pax7, was observed, full up-regulation of myogenin expression, an "executor" of myogenesis, was prevented, as well as the expression of the terminal differentiation marker of regenerating myofibers, eMyHC. More important, the size of regenerating myofibers, identified as eMyHC-positive myofibers, was significantly smaller in PKC −/regenerating muscle than in time-matching regenerating WT muscle. Taken together, these observations demonstrate that, FIGURE 6: PKCθ expression/activity is required for FAK phosphorylation. (A) Western blot analysis of WT, PKCθ −/-, and mPKCθK/R muscle-derived SCs, cultured in GM or for different periods of time in DM, as indicated. The blot was incubated with the α-FAK or with the α-phospho FAK antibodies. Representative experiment is shown of three independent experiments. Level of activation, determined by densitometric analysis as the phospho/total FAK ratio, is shown at the right. Representative immunofluorescence analysis of WT (a) or PKCθ −/-(b) muscle-derived cells cultured for 24 h in DM and incubated with the α-phospho FAK antibody is shown at the bottom.

As we show here, PKCθ is poorly expressed in proliferating myoblasts, but its expression is strongly up-regulated upon differentiation. Altogether, these observations suggest that, although FAK activation is a common feature, different PKC isoforms can be involved in cell to extracellular matrix and in cell-to-cell interactions, where different integrins are involved, and we show in the present study that activation of the θ isoform is indeed involved in FAK-mediated signaling leading to myoblast fusion. The fact that pharmacologically mediated full inhibition of FAK activity leads to similar fusion defects in both WT and PKCθ-null myoblasts further supports the hypothesis that the decreased FAK activation observed in PKCθ-null cells is sufficient to cause the phenotype. However, since no full FAK inhibition is observed in PKCθ-null myoblasts, other pathways might also contribute to FAK activation.</p><p>Different from what was observed when FAK activity was inhibited <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Quach et al., 2009)</ref>, lack of PKCθ also prevented the full activation of myogenin. Indeed other pathways have been shown to be involved in "secondary fusion," such as calcineurin-dependent NFATc2 activation, leading to the production of IL-4 <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Pavlath and Horsley, 2003)</ref>, proposed as a profusion cytokine. It is worth noting that we and others have shown that PKCθ is involved in many calcineurin-dependent signaling pathways, in both lymphocytes and myoblasts <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Villunger et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Pfeifhofer et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">D'Andrea et al., 2006)</ref>, suggesting that it may be involved in multiple signaling pathways which ultimately lead to complete differentiation/fusion events.</p><p>In conclusion, although the involvement of PKCθ in other pathways in regulating myoblast differentiation/fusion cannot be ruled out, we show in this article that it is indeed required for myoblast fusion, regulating FAK activation and, in turn, the expression of the profusion genes caveolin-3 and β1D integrin.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Antibodies and reagents</head><p>The following primary antibodies were used: anti-PKCθ and antiphospho Thr538 PKCθ rabbit polyclonal antibodies, anti-caveolin-3 and anti-MyoD mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAbs; BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA); anti-desmin mouse mAb (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark); anti-myosin heavy chain MF20, anti-eMyHC F1.652, anti-Pax7, and anti-myogenin F5D mouse mAbs (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, Iowa City, IA); rabbit polyclonal anti-PW1 (provided by D.A. Sassoon; <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Mitchell et al., 2010)</ref>; anti-β1D integrin (provided by G. Tarone; <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Belkin et al., 1996)</ref>; and anti-FAK and anti-phospho Tyr397 FAK antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa although SC activation and differentiation are not altered in PKCq −/-, further addition of fusing cells to regenerating myofibers (a process known as "secondary fusion") is, instead, prevented. Thus PKCθ expression/activity is required for the "resolution" of the SCs differentiation program during the late phases of regeneration, when myoblast fusion is required.</p><p>Accordingly, we show that PKCθ expression and activity were strongly induced in cultured muscle-derived cells within a few hours in DM, and inhibition of its expression (in PKCθ −/muscle-derived cells) or activity (in mPKCθK/R muscle-derived cells) significantly reduced fusion index and myonuclei content, as compared with WT cells. This defect was actually dependent on a defect in the fusion process itself, because no differences in the nature of the cell populations obtained from the different genotypes were observed, and, when cells were clonally cultured, no differences in cell proliferation or in cell death were observed. Indeed single clones from PKCθ −/muscle-derived cells still gave rise to thinner, oligonucleated myotubes, as compared with clones derived from WT cells. Taken together, these results demonstrate that PKCθ plays a critical role in myoblast fusion and myofiber growth, which can be referred to as "secondary fusion." This conclusion is further strengthened by the observation that the number of nuclei in PKCθ −/freshly isolated myofibers was lower than that in WT ones, suggesting that similar alterations are occurring in vivo as well. Many factors have been shown to be implicated in myoblast fusion, including components of the extracellular matrix remodeling, such as matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Lluri and Jaworski, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Lluri et al., 2008)</ref>; cell surface molecules, such as NCAM, N-and M-cadherins, a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 12, β1 integrins, and caveolin-3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Galbiati et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Abmayr et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Gullberg, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Horsley and Pavlath, 2004)</ref>; or even cytokines, such as interleukin 4 (IL-4; <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Horsley et al., 2003)</ref>. Whereas the activity of MMP-2 and -9 was not altered by ablation of PKCθ expression/activity (our unpublished observations), we show in this article that the up-regulation of β1D integrin and of caveolin-3 upon differentiation was significantly prevented. Thus PKCθ activity appears to be involved in signaling pathways regulating the expression of molecules involved in myoblast fusion. To date, a clear picture of these pathways is not depicted yet; however, full activation of caveolin-3 and β1D integrin expression has been recently shown to be required for "secondary fusion" and dependent on FAK activation <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Quach et al., 2009)</ref>. Indeed full FAK phosphorylation was prevented when PKCθ expression/activity was ablated in differentiating myoblasts, by either knocking the gene out or by expressing a dominant-negative mutant form. Accordingly, when a constitutively active PKCθ mutant form was exogenously expressed in cultured muscle cells, FAK phosphorylation was induced, demonstrating that PKCθ, either directly or indirectly, is involved in FAK activation. Several studies have indicated that PKC activation is required for FAK phosphorylation in cell-to-extracellular-matrix adhesion events and that they colocalize at focal adhesion sites <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Vuori and Ruoslahti, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Haimovich et al., 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Disatnik and Rando, 1999)</ref>. The precise functional relationship between these two kinases, however, is not completely understood yet. It has been previously shown that, during muscle cell adhesion and spreading, integrin engagement leads to FAK phosphorylation via a PKC-dependent signaling pathway <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Disatnik and Rando, 1999)</ref>; among the PKC isoforms analyzed, sequential activation of PKCε, -α, and -δ has been shown to be necessary to promote muscle cell spreading <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Disatnik et al., 2002)</ref>. It is worth noting that in those studies no PKCθ expression was detected; thus its involvement in those events was ruled out. Indeed those studies were carried out using proliferating muscle cells, because cell adhesion and spreading</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>FIGURE 3 :</head><label>3</label><figDesc>Lack of PKCθ inhibits myotube growth in vitro.
