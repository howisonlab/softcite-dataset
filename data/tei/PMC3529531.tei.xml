<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Relative changes in the dimensions of apical, lateral, and basal membranes control various morphogenesis processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(St Johnston and Sanson, 2011)</ref>. For example, the constriction of the apical membrane in a group of epithelial cells leads to their invagination, a mechanism that is used in diverse developmental programs, such as Drosophila melanogaster gastrulation or neural tube formation in vertebrates. Although we are beginning to understand the molecular machinery controlling apical constriction <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Harris, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Levayer and Lecuit, 2012)</ref>, it remains unclear how the formation of squamous and columnar epithelia is regulated.</p><p>Morphogenesis of a columnar epithelium from cuboidal precursors involves the expansion of the lateral membrane. In contrast, formation of squamous epithelia requires shrinking of the lateral membrane and expansion of the apical and basal membranes. It is unclear how these changes in membrane size and cell shape are regulated. Previous studies suggest roles for cell junctions and the cytoskeleton. It has been shown that the reorganization of the microtubule cytoskeleton is involved in the stretching of the Drosophila amnioserosa <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Pope and Harris, 2008)</ref>. A potential role of actin-Myosin-based contractility in preventing cell stretching can be deduced from data in the Drosophila follicular epithelium, where cells lacking Myosin function undergo a transition from a cuboidal to squamous cell shape <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Wang and Riechmann, 2007)</ref>. The same phenotype was observed when the function of adherens junctions is disturbed <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Müller, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Tanentzapf et al., 2000)</ref>. The finding that compromised cell adhesion results in cell flattening suggests that squamous cell morphogenesis can be induced by reducing adhesion between cells. This raises the possibility that epithelial cells control the size of their lateral membrane by regulating the abundance or localization of cell adhesion molecules. An increase in the number of adhesion molecules could lead to an expansion of the lateral membrane, whereas their reduction allows membrane shrinking.</p><p>Two important protein families mediating cell adhesion are cadherins and immunoglobulin superfamily of cell adhesion molecules. A prominent member of the latter family is N-CAM (neural cell adhesion molecule) and its insect homologue Fas2 (Fasciclin 2), which mediate homophilic interactions in the R egulation of epithelial cell shape, for example, changes in relative sizes of apical, basal, and lateral membranes, is a key mechanism driving morphogenesis. However, it is unclear how epithelial cells control the size of their membranes. In the epithelium of the Drosophila melanogaster ovary, cuboidal precursor cells transform into a squamous epithelium through a process that involves lateral membrane shortening coupled to apical membrane extension. In this paper, we report a mutation in the gene Tao, which resulted in the loss of this cuboidal to squamous transition. We show that the inability of Tao mutant cells to shorten their membranes was caused by the accumulation of the cell adhesion molecule Fasciclin 2, the Drosophila N-CAM (neural cell adhesion molecule) homologue. Fasciclin 2 accumulation at the lateral membrane of Tao mutant cells prevented membrane shrinking and thereby inhibited morphogenesis. In wild-type cells, Tao initiated morphogenesis by promoting Fasciclin 2 endocytosis at the lateral membrane. Thus, we identify here a mechanism controlling the morphogenesis of a squamous epithelium.</p><p>cell polarity <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Timm et al., 2003)</ref>. Analysis of Tao in Drosophila revealed functions in controlling microtubule plus-end growth in cultured cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Liu et al., 2010)</ref>, in regulating apoptosis of germ cells in the embryo <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Sato et al., 2007)</ref>, and in the development of the adult brain <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(King et al., 2011)</ref>. Two recent studies show that Tao is also involved in growth regulation of imaginal discs, in which Tao activates the Salvador-Warts-Hippo (SWH) pathway by phosphorylating Hippo kinase <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Boggiano et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Poon et al., 2011)</ref>. Here, we report the generation of a Tao allele lacking kinase activity, which allowed us to study a new function of Tao in regulating morphogenesis of the follicular epithelium. Tao reduces lateral adhesion between epithelial cells by promoting Fas2 endocytosis. Decreased cell adhesion permits shrinking of the lateral membrane and initiates the morphogenesis of the squamous epithelium.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Tao is required for follicle cell morphogenesis</head><p>We have identified Tao protein in a biochemical screen for proteins that are phosphorylated by Par-1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Riechmann and Ephrussi, 2004)</ref>. To identify a possible function of Tao during Drosophila oogenesis, we performed an ethane methyl sulfonate (EMS) screen, in which we generated one chromosome with a point mutation in the second exon of the Tao gene (Tao eta ), resulting in a premature stop codon at aa 64. The predicted protein harbors only a 37-aa fragment of the kinase domain lacking its active site. As homozygous Tao eta mutants are lethal, we recombined the mutation onto a FLP recombination target (FRT) chromosome to generate genetic mosaics with the FRT/FLP technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Xu and Rubin, 1993)</ref>. Par-1 controls the establishment of the anterior-posterior axis of the oocyte by polarizing the microtubule cytoskeleton, which is necessary for the localization of Oskar to the posterior pole of the oocyte <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Shulman et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Tomancak et al., 2000)</ref>. Surprisingly, neither Oskar localization nor microtubule polarity is affected in Tao mutant oocytes, indicating that Tao is not necessary for establishment of anterior-posterior polarity <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. S2 A)</ref>.</p><p>Closer inspection of egg chambers with Tao eta mutant cells revealed morphological defects in the follicular epithelium, which become apparent during stage 8/9 when a monolayer of cuboidal precursors is transformed into a squamous anterior and a columnar posterior epithelium. Tao mutant cell clones in the anterior part of the epithelium fail to stretch and stay cuboidal ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref> A, left clone). Posterior clones show milder morphological defects, which are reflected by an increase in the length of the lateral membrane compared with wild-type cells ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1 A, right clone)</ref>. To test whether Tao eta behaves as a lossof-function allele, we generated a chromosome with a small deletion that uncovers the entire open reading frame of Tao and two neighboring genes (see Materials and methods). Cell clones generated with this deletion show the same epithelial defects as Tao eta clones, indicating that Tao eta is indeed a loss-of-function allele <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 1 B)</ref>.</p><p>To confirm that the morphogenesis defect is caused by loss of Tao function, we performed rescue experiments with extracellular space. E-cadherin is a central component of the adherens junctions, the site of apicolateral cell contacts. The extracellular part of E-cadherin connects neighboring cells, whereas its intracellular part serves as an anchoring point for the actin cytoskeleton and several other proteins, including -Catenin <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Harris and Tepass, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Baum and Georgiou, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Epithelial morphogenesis can be studied in the follicular epithelium of the Drosophila ovary. This organ is composed of follicles of different ages, which are subdivided into 14 different developmental stages <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Horne-Badovinac and Bilder, 2005)</ref>. Follicles or egg chambers consist of an inner cyst of germline cells (made of 15 nurse cells and one oocyte) surrounded by a monolayered follicular epithelium with initially cuboidal-shaped cells <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. S1 A)</ref>. During early oogenesis, the germline cyst grows in size, leading to a volume increase that is accommodated by cell divisions in the epithelium. This changes after stage 6 when cell divisions cease because of the expression of Delta in the germline activating Notch signaling in the epithelium <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Deng et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">López-Schier and St Johnston, 2001)</ref>. Although the germline cyst continues to increase its volume after stage 6, the epithelium undergoes morphogenesis and subdivides into an anterior squamous and a posterior columnar part ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. S1 B)</ref>. As a result, egg chambers develop with a posterior columnar epithelium covering the oocyte and an anterior squamous epithelium consisting of large and flat cells covering the nurse cells.</p><p>Morphometric analysis and mechanical modeling suggest that the growth of the inner cyst is a critical force for the morphogenesis of the squamous epithelium. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Kolahi et al. (2009)</ref> propose a model in which the volume increase of the inner cyst exerts a tensile force on the outer epithelium inducing flattening of cells specifically in anterior epithelium. In the posterior epithelium, this force is counteracted by the apical actin cytoskeleton, which is organized by -Spectrin and contracted by Myosin <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Zarnescu and Thomas, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Wang and Riechmann, 2007)</ref>. Anterior cells are unable to counteract cyst pressure and flatten. A possible reason for their inability to resist pressure is the locally restricted disassembly of their adherens junctions at positions where three or four cells meet <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Grammont, 2007)</ref>. As the adherens junctions anchor the actin cytoskeleton, their local breakdown could destabilize the apical actin network and trigger cell flattening <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Kolahi et al., 2009)</ref>. Adherens junction disassembly proceeds from anterior to the middle region of the follicle concomitant with stretching, suggesting a critical role for squamous cell morphogenesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Grammont, 2007)</ref>. It has been shown that Notch signaling is required for adherens junction breakdown during stretching <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Grammont, 2007)</ref>, but other genes contributing to epithelial stretching are unknown. Here, we identify the gene Tao as a critical regulator for squamous cell morphogenesis.</p><p>The Ser/Thr kinase Tao has been shown to activate the stress-responsive MAPK pathway in mammalian cell lines <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Hutchison et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Raman et al., 2007)</ref>. Tao uses the same pathway in cultured hippocampal neurons to trigger endocytosis of N-cadherin in dendritic spines <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Yasuda et al., 2007)</ref>. A biochemical study isolated Tao because of its ability to phosphorylate Par-1, a kinase regulating microtubule dynamics and no cell proliferation after stage 6 as detected by phospho-Histone H3 stainings (n = 51; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. S2</ref>, B-E). We therefore conclude that Tao is not acting via the SWH pathway in the follicular epithelium. We also ruled out that the morphogenesis defects in Tao mutant cells results from patterning defects in the follicular epithelium by analyzing the localization of the cell fate specification markers Eya and phospho-Mad <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. S2</ref>, F-I).</p><p>In mammalian cell lines, Tao activates the p38 signaling cascade in response to cellular stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Hutchison et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Raman et al., 2007)</ref>. To test whether this signaling module is activated by Tao in the follicular epithelium, we analyzed the function of five kinases that were shown to act downstream of Tao. Neither cell clones for Mpk2D/p38a and Dsor nor double mutant clones for licorne and hemipterous showed defects in follicle cell morphology <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. S2</ref>, J-L). Moreover, expression of a dominant-negative form of p38b in the follicular epithelium did not produce defects in the follicular epithelium (unpublished data). These data suggest that Tao is unlikely to regulate morphogenesis by activating the p38 cascade.</p><p>As Tao regulates microtubule dynamics in mammalian and Drosophila cell lines <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Timm et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Liu et al., 2010)</ref>, we examined whether Tao controls epithelial cell shape by acting on the cytoskeleton. Careful analysis of the microtubule cytoskeleton showed no differences in the organization of an upstream activation sequence (UAS)-Tao transgene, which rescues lethality of homozygous Tao eta mutants when induced by the ubiquitous Tubulin-Gal4 driver line. The same transgene is able to fully rescue the stretching process in the anterior epithelial cells with a follicle cell-specific driver (GR1-Gal4; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1 C)</ref>. We analyzed the subcellular localization of Tao by expressing a HA fusion protein, which also rescues morphogenesis ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1 D)</ref>. HA-Tao protein accumulates in the basolateral cytoplasm and at the lateral membrane of the follicular epithelium ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1 I)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Tao regulates accumulation of polarity proteins at the plasma membrane</head><p>We tested whether Tao controls epithelial morphogenesis by one of its known mechanism or pathways. It has been shown that Tao regulates the SWH pathway in imaginal discs <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Meignin et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Polesello and Tapon, 2007)</ref>. In the follicular epithelium, SWH signaling is involved in ceasing cell proliferation after stage 6 of oogenesis, and cell clones with loss of SWH activity show prolonged proliferation as well as aberrant localization and delayed down-regulation of Notch. Moreover, SWH mutant clones express Fasciclin 3 and Eyes absent (Eya) ectopically after stage 6. Homozygous Tao eta clones, however, reveal a normal localization of Notch, Fasciclin 3, and Eya and show knockdown and providing an explanation why the rescue is not fully penetrant ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2 H, inset)</ref>.</p><p>To quantify the results of the interaction screen, we measured the length of the apicobasal axis of anterior epithelial cells to calculate a mean apicobasal length proportion (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. S4</ref>). The mean value for wild-type versus Tao mutant cells is 1.8, meaning that the mean apicobasal axis of anterior Tao mutant cells is almost twice as long. This is in contrast to the mean value of 1.2 measured in egg chambers, in which Tao mutant clones and Fas2 knockdown have been induced. Thus, a reduction of Fas2 protein levels suppresses the morphogenetic defects of Tao mutant cells. Interestingly, Fas2 knockdown in Tao mutant cells suppresses not only the morphological defects but also the overaccumulation of Arm at the membrane <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 2 D)</ref>. As no other gene knockdown in our candidate approach was able to suppress Tao defects, we conclude that the overaccumulation of Fas2 protein in Tao cells is a major reason for their inability to undergo morphogenesis.</p><p>To further support that Fas2 accumulation is causing Tao morphogenesis defects, we generated Fas2 Tao double mutants by recombining a null allele (Fas2 eb1112 ) with Tao eta . Larger homozygous mutant cell clones in the follicular epithelium are lethal, suggesting an interaction of the two genes in cell viability during early oogenesis. However, we could recover small clones in stage 8/9 egg chambers, which all stretch normally (n = 8; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2</ref>, I and J). Moreover, double mutant clones accumulate normal Arm protein levels at their membranes, indicating a complete rescue of the Tao phenotype. Thus, Fas2 Tao double mutant clones strongly support that the morphogenesis defects in Tao mutant cells are caused by Fas2 accumulation. We therefore hypothesized that Tao acts through Fas2 during epithelial morphogenesis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Timely controlled down-regulation of Fas2 is critical for epithelial stretching</head><p>The transmembrane protein Fas2 harbors five immunoglobulin domains, which mediate homophilic cell adhesion between the lateral membranes of follicle cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Szafranski and Goode, 2004)</ref>. The homophilic adhesion properties of Fas2 suggest a simple explanation for the stretching failure of Tao mutant cells: the increased accumulation of Fas2 at the lateral membrane results in increased cell-cell adhesion, which prevents membrane shrinking and hence morphogenesis. As this hypothesis implies that Fas2 is lost from the lateral membrane before stretching, we reexamined Fas2 localization during morphogenesis. It has been reported that the Fas2 protein is absent from anterior follicle cells at stage 8 <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Szafranski and Goode, 2004)</ref>. Our analysis of the temporal changes in Fas2 localization showed that anterior epithelial cells loose Fas2 when they are still cuboidal, indicating that down-regulation precedes stretching <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. 3 B)</ref>. This supports the idea that Fas2 has to be removed from the lateral membrane to allow stretching. Fas2 is no longer detectable in stretching follicle cells <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. 3</ref>, C-D), whereas DE-cadherin forms a zonula adherens ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3 D, red channel)</ref>. This suggests that cell adhesion in stretching cells is mainly mediated by DE-cadherin. In contrast to the anterior cells, posterior cells maintain Fas2 at their microtubules between wild-type and Tao mutant cells. Neither the density of -Tubulin-stained microtubules nor microtubule polarity revealed by the localization of -Tubulin, Nod-lacZ, and Kinesin-lacZ is affected in Tao mutant cells ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. S3</ref>, A-D). Moreover, Tao mutant cells do not show significant differences in the distribution of F-actin, -Spectrin, and Myosin activity, indicating that Tao does not act on the actin cytoskeleton <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. S3</ref>, E and F). We therefore conclude that Tao does not regulate morphogenesis via the cytoskeleton.</p><p>To examine a possible role of Tao in cell polarity, we analyzed epithelial membrane domains, which are established by polarity proteins localizing to the apical or lateral membrane. Crumbs (Crb), Par-6, and atypical PKC (aPKC) localize to the apical membrane, whereas Discs large (Dlg), Coracle, and Fas2 distribute laterally <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Laprise and Tepass, 2011)</ref>. Tao mutant follicle cells localize all aforementioned proteins correctly, indicating that the overall apicobasal polarity of the follicular epithelium is not affected <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 1</ref>, E-H). Analysis of the adherens junction components DE-cadherin and -Catenin/Armadillo (Arm) revealed that they are present in the apicolateral region of the epithelium but accumulate at higher levels compared with neighboring wild-type cells (Figs. 1 A and 2 A). Moreover, their localization is not restricted to the apicolateral region but spreads into the apical membrane domain of Tao mutant cells. The apical marker Crb, Par-6, and aPKC also accumulate at higher levels but are still restricted to their domain <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 1</ref>, E and F). Among the lateral markers, only Fas2 shows an increased membrane accumulation, whereas we detected no obvious difference in Dlg and Coracle levels ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>, E, G, and H). Thus, although Tao is not essential for the establishment of membrane polarity, it regulates the accumulation proteins at the plasma membrane.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fas2 suppresses epithelial morphogenesis defects in Tao mutant cells</head><p>To assess whether the increased accumulation of membrane proteins causes the morphogenesis defects in Tao mutant cells, we tested whether a reduction of this accumulation by RNAi rescues Tao defects. To identify possible mediators of the defects, we performed a candidate in vivo RNAi interaction screen. We generated Tao mutant cell clones, in which candidate proteins are knocked down by inducing UAS-RNAi and UAS-Flippase transgenes with the same Gal4 driver line (see Materials and methods). In this screen, we included not only proteins that accumulate in Tao mutant cells but also other possible Taointeracting genes, such as par-1 and Eb1 (encoding a microtubule plus end-binding protein), and genes encoding members of the SWH pathway <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">(Table S1)</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2</ref> compares the results for the interaction of Tao with genes encoding the transmembrane proteins Crb, DE-cadherin, and Fas2 as examples. Among the 10 genes tested in this approach, only Fas2 RNAi rescues Tao morphogenesis defects. In approximately half of the analyzed stage 9 egg chambers, the stretching defects of Tao mutant cell clones (n = 16) were clearly suppressed when Fas2 function was simultaneously reduced by RNAi. Analysis of Fas2 expression in this experiment revealed residual protein after RNAi, indicating an incomplete shrinking. Thus, timely controlled removal of Fas2 is critical for stretching of the anterior follicle cells.</p><p>The critical role for Fas2 in epithelial morphogenesis raised the question whether the adhesion molecule is required for cell shape maintenance before stretching starts. Analysis of Fas2 mutant cell clones showed that they stay cuboidal until stage 7 and then undergo normal morphogenesis <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. 3, F and G)</ref>. Thus, although the down-regulation of Fas2 is critical for stretching, the protein is not essential for maintaining epithelial cell shape before morphogenesis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fas2 removal from the lateral membrane is mediated by endocytosis</head><p>Fas2 down-regulation in the follicular epithelium is controlled at the transcriptional level <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Szafranski and Goode, 2004)</ref>. We confirmed this by analyzing three enhancer trap lines, which reflect the transcriptional activity of the Fas2 locus <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. S5</ref>, A-C; membranes, where it is now confined to the apicolateral region ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3 C, arrowheads)</ref>.</p><p>To test the hypothesis that Fas2 interferes with stretching of anterior cells, we overexpressed a UAS-Fas2-YFP construct using traffic jam-Gal4, a driver line providing high expression levels in all follicle cells. Fas2 overexpression delays stretching and results in the formation of elongated egg chambers, in which anterior follicle cells retain a cuboidal cell shape at stage 9 ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3 E)</ref>. Interestingly, these cell shape defects are accompanied by increased levels of the adherens junction component Arm at the apical membrane closely resembling Tao mutant cells (Figs. 3 E and 2 A, compare insets). Thus, Fas2 overexpression mimics the Tao phenotype, strongly supporting the hypothesis that increased Fas2 levels cause the defects of Tao mutant cells. In summary, our data show that Fas2 is lost from anterior follicle cells before they undergo stretching and that prolonged Fas2 expression interferes with lateral membrane shows an optical confocal section at the level of the zonula adherens, revealing the onset of stretching in the anterior-most cells. Arm overaccumulation is suppressed. Eight double mutant clones were obtained in total, two of them were in an asymmetric position (not depicted), allowing the calculation of the apical-basal length proportion with a value of 1.1. Blue dotted lines mark the border of the Tao mutant clones. Processing of the images involved adjustment of  settings. Bars: (white) 50 µm; (black) 12.5 µm.</p><p>with a Fas2-specific antibody and overexpressed GFP-tagged Rab5 protein <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Fig. 4 A)</ref>.</p><p>To examine whether vesicle trafficking contributes to Fas2 removal from the lateral membrane, we counted the total number of Fas2 puncta and puncta that colocalize either with Rab5 or Rab11 vesicles. We distinguished between egg chambers of three different stages: early follicles that were still round (stage 5/6), oval follicles with no signs of anterior Fas2 disappearance (stage 7), and follicles with cuboidal anterior cells, in which the anterior Fas2 signal starts to disappear (stage 8; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 4 D, pictures)</ref>. This analysis revealed a continuous increase in the number of Fas2 vesicles between stages 6 and 8 <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Fig. 4 D)</ref>. Moreover, the total number of Fas2-Rab5-positive vesicles per cell increases strongly during this period <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Fig. 4 E)</ref>. Similarly, the proportion of Fas2-Rab5 vesicles in relation to the total number of Rab5 vesicles rises from 3 to 13%, suggesting that an increasing part of the endocytic machinery is engaged in the internalization of Fas2 before stretching occurs <ref type="table">(Table S3</ref>). We therefore conclude that Fas2 removal from the lateral membrane is mediated by endocytosis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fas2 endocytosis is impaired in Tao mutant cells</head><p>Tao mutant clones exhibit Fas2-positive tubular structures associated with the plasma membrane ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 5 A, arrowheads)</ref>. These structures are reminiscent of tubules that have been and not depicted). To examine whether Tao is involved in Fas2 repression, we recombined the enhancer trap insertions with the Tao eta mutation and induced mutant cell clones. A comparison of reporter signal intensities between mutant and heterozygous cells provided no evidence for a function of Tao in repressing Fas2 transcription <ref type="table">(Table S2</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. S5, D and E)</ref>. Thus, Tao does not appear to regulate Fas2 gene expression and might mediate down-regulation of Fas2 at a posttranscriptional level.</p><p>A possible level of control is the removal of existing protein from the lateral membrane, which is most commonly achieved by packaging the protein into vesicles that are destined for degradation. To investigate the role of vesicle trafficking, we analyzed Fas2 distribution in optical sections perpendicular to the apicobasal axis of the epithelium and identified cytoplasmic Fas2-positive puncta <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Figs. 4 A and 3 D)</ref>. We characterized these puncta using an exon trap line, which tags endogenously expressed Fas2 protein with GFP <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Silies and Klämbt, 2010)</ref> and which shows the puncta in the same pattern as the Fas2 antibody <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Fig. 4, B and C)</ref>. Using this line, we performed triple stainings with antibodies detecting Fas2 (GFP), endosomes (Rab5), and recycling vesicles (Rab11), which identify only endogenously expressed proteins. This analysis showed many Fas2 puncta that colocalize with one of the two Rab proteins, indicating that Fas2 is endocytosed and recycled at the membrane <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Fig. 4</ref>, B and C). Fas2 endocytosis was further supported by stainings  indicating that Tao is required for efficient Fas2 endocytosis in the follicular epithelium <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 5 C)</ref>.</p><p>To further characterize the endocytosis defect in Tao mutants, we quantified the formation of Rab5-positive Fas2 vesicles in homozygous mutant and heterozygous cells. To this end, we recombined the Fas2 exon trap GFP insertion with the Tao eta mutation. To mark cell clones independently of GFP, we generated a P(neoFRT)19A chromosome with a follicle cell-specific enhancer trap, enabling us to detect follicle cell nuclei that are wild type for Tao with -Galactosidase <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Müller, 2000)</ref>. Using these chromosomes, we generated cell clones colabeled for Fas2-GFP and Rab5 and quantified confocal pictures by counting the number of Rab5 vesicles, vesicular Fas2 structures, and their colocalization. Moreover, we determined the subcellular localization of vesicular Fas2-Rab5 structures described for mutants that affect vesicle scission and endocytosis in the epithelium of the Drosophila notum <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Georgiou et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Leibfried et al., 2008)</ref>. To test whether Tao is required for endocytosis, we performed uptake experiments, in which we incubated mosaic egg chambers with fluorescently labeled dextran. Quantification of dextran vesicle numbers in confocal pictures revealed that dextran internalization is significantly reduced in Tao mutant cells compared with neighboring heterozygous cells <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 5 B)</ref>. We also tested whether this approach monitors Fas2 endocytosis by staining ovaries after dextran incubation with an anti-Fas2 antibody. Notably, many dextran vesicles were Fas2 positive in wild-type cells, indicating that dextran was included in Fas2 endocytotic vesicles ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 5 D, arrowheads)</ref>. In Tao mutant cells, the number of dextran vesicles colocalizing with Fas2 is strongly reduced, by distinguishing between cytoplasmic puncta <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 5 E, arrowheads)</ref> and semicircular or tubular structures associated with the plasma membrane ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 5 E, arrows)</ref>. This analysis revealed that in Tao mutant cells, plasma membrane-associated Fas2-Rab5 structures were increased, whereas Fas2-Rab5 vesicles in the cytoplasm were reduced ( <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>). The increased accumulation of Fas2-Rab5 structures at the plasma membrane suggests that formation or scission of endocytic Fas2 vesicles is impaired in Tao mutant cells. Moreover, it is possible that Tao predominantly affects the formation of endocytotic Fas2 vesicles, as the spatial distribution of other (Fas2 negative) Rab5 vesicles was not affected in Tao mutant cells. Collectively, these results suggest that Tao activates Fas2 endocytosis by promoting the formation of Rab5 vesicles.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Here, we report a novel mechanism regulating the morphogenesis of a squamous epithelium. Our data show that timely controlled removal of the adhesion molecule Fas2 from the lateral membrane is critical for the stretching of cuboidal precursor cells. In this process, Tao initiates morphogenesis by promoting Fas2 endocytosis from the lateral membrane, which reduces adhesive forces and thereby provides plasticity for the cuboidal to squamous cell shape change. Our results are consistent with a model in which homophilic Fas2 interactions act as a glue preventing shortening of the membrane.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A role for Tao in promoting endocytosis</head><p>Tao function is essential for the process of stretching of epithelial cells. However, our data indicate that Tao uses none of its known pathways to control morphogenesis. Similarly, we found no evidence that Tao regulates cell stretching via the cytoskeleton. Moreover, our results argue against a role for Tao in transcriptional repression of Fas2, indicating a function in posttranslational regulation. Indeed, our quantitative analysis of Fas2 vesicles in wild-type follicles indicates that membrane shrinking is initiated by enhanced endocytosis. Tao mutant cells have a reduced ability to internalize Fas2 vesicles, contain tubular Fas2 structures typical for endocytosis defects, and show fewer endocytotic Fas2 vesicles in the cytoplasm. This indicates that the overaccumulation of Fas2 at the lateral membrane is caused by defective Fas2 internalization, suggesting a role for Tao in promoting endocytosis at the lateral membrane. A similar function of Tao in triggering endocytosis of homophilic adhesion proteins has been identified in cultured hippocampal neurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Yasuda et al., 2007)</ref>. In contrast to the follicular epithelium, however, Tao is acting via the p38 MAP signaling pathway in this cell type.</p><p>Tao promotes Fas2 endocytosis not only in the anterior squamous epithelium but acts also in the posterior epithelium, whose cells become columnar by elongating their lateral membrane <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 1, A and H)</ref>. Although it is surprising that these cells down-regulate a protein that is able to induce cell elongation, it appears that during stage 7/8, all epithelial cells clear their lateral membrane from Fas2 to allow morphogenesis. This suggests that other proteins than Fas2 are responsible for cell elongation in the posterior epithelium.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Is Tao an endocytosis promoter specific for the lateral membrane?</head><p>Endocytosis is only impaired but not blocked in Tao mutant cells, as they are still able to internalize reduced levels of dextran and Fas2. Consistent with this, the Tao phenotype differs from mutants affecting endocytosis in general. Although cell clones mutant for Rab5, the syntaxin family member Avalanche, and Dynamin/Shibire show severe polarity defects and massive overproliferation in the follicular epithelium (unpublished data; <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Lu and Bilder, 2005)</ref>, the Tao phenotype is restricted to overaccumulation of membrane proteins and cell shape defects. We therefore conclude that Tao is not a general endocytosis factor but enhances endocytosis at a critical developmental stage to allow epithelial morphogenesis.</p><p>This timely controlled requirement of Tao function raises the question whether Tao expression starts just before the onset of morphogenesis or whether the protein is present also in early stages and only activated when Fas2 has to be removed from the lateral membrane. We were unable to detect endogenous Tao protein, as antibodies generated by us and others showed no specific signal in the follicular epithelium. Moreover, analysis of Tao mRNA expression does not allow unambiguous conclusions about the onset of Tao transcription in the follicular epithelium as a strong signal from the germline cyst covers the signal in the surrounding epithelium. Confocal pictures of seven stage 8/9 genetic mosaic egg chambers were analyzed, which were stained with GFP to highlight Fas2, Rab5 to mark endosomes, and -Galactosidase to identify wild-type cells. Total counts of Fas2 puncta per cell reflect only cytoplasmic puncta and do not include plasma membrane-associated structures. Rab5 vesicles are distinguished between vesicles that overlap with the center of the plasma membrane (within membrane), vesicles whose signal overlaps with the plasma membrane but does not touch its center (membrane associated), and vesicles that do not overlap with the plasma membrane (cytoplasmic).</p><p>Membrane-associated Rab5 vesicles are further distinguished between vesicles that reveal Fas2-positive semicircular or tubular membrane protrusions (+Fas2) and vesicles without such protrusions (Fas2). t test (two-tailed equal variance;  = 0.05) was performed to describe the statistical significance of the difference between the values obtained for vesicle numbers in homozygous versus homozygous cell clones.</p><p>proteins, which then concentrate within a restricted area. We therefore propose that the accumulation of Arm, DE-cadherin, and apical proteins in Tao mutant cells is not caused by impaired endocytosis but a result of the inability of these cells to increase their surface area. Consistent with this, we found that cells whose stretching is prevented by Fas2 overexpression (and which are wild type for Tao function) also concentrate Arm within their restricted apical surface <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. 3 E)</ref>. A membrane domain-specific endocytosis function for Tao is also supported by experiments, which deplete Fas2 in Tao mutant cells. If Tao would act all along the plasma membrane, Fas2 removal from the lateral membrane should selectively rescue the lateral defect (i.e., Fas2 accumulation) but should not suppress the accumulation of apical and apicolateral proteins (e.g., Arm). However, Fas2 Tao double mutant cells do suppress Arm accumulation <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 2 J)</ref>. Thus, the primary defect of Tao mutants is Fas2 accumulation, which prevents stretching and expansion of the apical surface. The concentration of Arm is only a secondary effect of the cell shape defect.</p><p>In conclusion, our data favor a model in which Tao promotes endocytosis specifically at the lateral membrane to relieve Fas2mediated cell adhesion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The role of Tao in squamous cell morphogenesis</head><p>The identification of a mechanism initiating epithelial morphogenesis in the follicular epithelium allows us to update the current model of squamous cell morphogenesis in the follicular epithelium. Before morphogenesis, all epithelial cells are cuboidal and adhere apicolaterally via DE-cadherin and more basolaterally via Fas2 interactions. In this period, Fas2 is endocytosed and recycled back to the membrane <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Fig. 6, stage 6)</ref>. Morphogenesis is primed by the Tao kinase, which promotes the endocytosis of Fas2 vesicles. We assume that a large proportion of the Fas2 vesicles enter the lysosomal pathway, leading to Fas2 degradation <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Fig. 6, stage 8)</ref>. The removal of Fas2 from the lateral membrane is a critical first step, which allows morphogenesis to occur. Once Fas2 has disappeared, the cuboidal shape of the epithelial cells is solely stabilized by the zonula adherens. Cell flattening requires a tensile force, and morphometric analysis indicates that this force originates from the continuously growing germline cyst, which stretches cells in the anterior epithelium <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Fig. 6, stage 9</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Kolahi et al., 2009)</ref>. Flattening correlates well with the local breakdown of the zonula adherens, suggesting an important role for adherens junctions remodeling in cell stretching <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Grammont, 2007)</ref>. Although the exact molecular mechanism controlling remodeling has still to be elucidated, our data indicate that before cell stretching, lateral cell adhesion has to be reduced to provide morphogenetic plasticity to the lateral membrane.</p><p>Given the critical role of Fas2 down-regulation for epithelial stretching, it is counterintuitive that Fas2 mutant cells undergo normal morphogenesis. However, a similar scenario has been shown for the morphogenesis of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) in Drosophila. Here, Fas2 has to be endocytosed in axons to allow glia cell migration. Despite this important function for Fas2 down-regulation, Fas2 mutants Using a HA fusion protein, we detected Tao protein at the lateral membrane and in the basolateral cytoplasm of the follicular epithelium. Interestingly, Tao protein accumulation appears as a gradient with the lowest levels in the apical and the highest levels in the basal region of the follicular epithelium <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 1 I)</ref>. As our rescue experiments demonstrate the functionality of the fusion protein, a gradient of endogenous Tao activity might also exist. This raises the possibility that Tao promotes endocytosis more strongly in basal regions of the lateral membrane. We speculate that there is a switch in Tao activity at the border between the lateral and the basal membrane and that the basal membrane domain is protected from Tao function. A spatial restriction of Tao function to the lateral membrane could be achieved by the localization of a yet unidentified target of Tao kinase. Such a Tao mediator could exclusively localize to the lateral membrane.</p><p>The finding that not only Fas2 but also apical and apicolateral proteins, such as DE-cadherin and Crb, overaccumulate in Tao mutants might argue against a restriction of Tao function to the lateral membrane. However, in the light of the dramatic change in the geometry of stretching cells, an alternative explanation for the accumulation of these proteins seems more likely. Squamous cell morphogenesis involves a 15-fold surface expansion, which is accompanied by a strong increase in the amounts of proteins determining the apical membrane and forming the adherens junctions. Interestingly, also, posterior cells expand their surface, albeit in less dramatic manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Kolahi et al., 2009)</ref>. Tao mutant cells are unable to increase their surface area, but they nevertheless produce the same amount of apical and apicolateral bath for 1 h for a consecutive 3 d. After eclosion, females were kept at 27°C for 2-3 d and dissected. Alternatively, a UAS-FLP was induced in follicular epithelium using the GR1-Gal4 driver. To this end, flies were raised at 27°C and, after eclosion, shifted to 29°C for 28-48 h and dissected.</p><p>Overexpression of the UAS-Fas2-YFP was performed using the traffic jam-Gal4 driver.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Quantification of genetic interaction experiments</head><p>The quantification of the interaction between the Tao eta allele and knockdown of candidate genes was conducted in stage 9 egg chambers carrying asymmetric clones with respect to the anterior-posterior axis (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. S4</ref>). To assess the interaction, the apical-basal cell length of both Tao eta + RNAi and RNAi only (or wild-type control) cells was measured at the level of the nuclei using the confocal microscope (LSM 700) software or ImageJ (National Institutes of Health). The apical-basal length proportion show no gross morphological defects in the PNS <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Silies and Klämbt, 2010)</ref>. Thus, although Fas2 down-regulation is critical for epithelial and PNS morphogenesis, both tissues can compensate for the complete loss of the protein. We propose that Fas2 helps to stabilize a morphological state and allows development to proceed only after its timely controlled endocytosis. This mechanism guarantees the correct timing of morphogenesis and thereby helps to coordinate the development of different cell types and tissues. In the follicular epithelium, Fas2 might collaborate with the zonula adherens in counteracting the pressure from the growing germline cyst. As a result, the cuboidal cell shape is stabilized and premature, and uncontrolled stretching is prevented. Subsequently, Fas2 internalization overcomes this control mechanism, and epithelial morphogenesis proceeds.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Generation of Tao mutants</head><p>To generate EMS-induced Tao mutants, we made use of an EP element that is inserted into the first, untranslated exon of the Tao locus (EP1455). This transposon neither affects viability nor fertility of the mutant flies. EP elements integrate UAS sequences into the genome, allowing the overexpression of adjacent genes by a Gal4 driver line. Induction of Tao expression by combining EP1455 with the ubiquitous driver Tubulin-Gal4 results in lethality. We used this lethal combination of chromosomes to screen for suppressor mutations. To this end, we fed males harboring the EP element with EMS and crossed them to females expressing the Tubulin-Gal4 driver. After screening of more than 10,000 crosses, we obtained 13 suppressors of lethality, which are good candidates to carry mutations in the Tao locus. Among those, one suppressor mutation was lethal by itself, which we named Tao eta .

Levels of Dlg protein at the lateral membrane show no obvious increase (left insets). Tao mutant cells (top insets) have an elongated apical-basal axis. (F) Tao mutant cell clones showing overaccumulation of Crb and Par-6 proteins at the apical membrane. (G) Tao mutant cell clones showing an elongated apical-basal axis and expressing normal levels of the lateral membrane marker Coracle. (H) Tao mutant cells show a strong increase of Fas2 at the lateral membrane. (I) Expression of the UAS-HA-Tao transgene in an otherwise wild-type background showing the localization of Tao protein at the lateral membrane and in the basolateral cytoplasm. Processing of the images involved adjustment of  settings. Bars: (white) 50 µm; (black) 12.5 µm.</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Morphogenesis defects in Tao mutant cells are mediated by Fas2 overaccumulation. (A-I) Stage 9 egg chambers. Insets show enlarged areas of the region marked by the white frames. (A-H) Egg chambers with Tao mutant clones marked by the absence of GFP and stained for Arm (A-D) or Fas2 (E-H). The indicated apical-basal length proportions (a-b prop.; see also Fig. S4) is the mean value obtained in at least three different asymmetric clones. A and E show Tao clones in a wild-type background, and B, C, and F-H show clones in follicles in which crb, DE-cadherin (DE-Cad), and Fas2 are knocked down using GR1-Gal4-driven UAS-inverted repeat transgenes. (B and F) crb knockdown neither suppresses the stretching defects nor the overaccumulation of Arm and Fas2 in Tao clones. (C and G) DE-cadherin knockdown results in defects in egg chamber morphology and mislocalization of Arm, which are explained by defects in zonula adherens formation. Fas2 accumulates at the lateral membrane of Tao mutant cells, which fail to stretch. (D and H) Fas2 knockdown suppresses the stretching defects in Tao mutant cells, and Arm accumulation reverts to normal levels. Note that the residual Fas2 protein is detectable, indicating that the knockdown is not complete (inset in H). (I and J) Follicles with cell clones doubly mutant for Tao and Fas2 stained for Arm protein. Images to the right of I and J show the Arm channel alone. Mutant cells are marked by red asterisks and reveal no stretching defects. J (left)</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_2"><head>Figure 3 .</head><label>3</label><figDesc>The role of Fas2 during morphogenesis of the squamous epithelium. (A-D) Localization of Fas2 and DE-cadherin (DE-Cad) in stage 7 (A), stage 8 (B), and stage 9 (C and D) follicles. Insets show the Fas2 signal in the framed regions at a higher magnification. Fas2 is down-regulated in anterior follicle cells between stages 7 and 8. (B) Note the disappearance of the Fas2 signal when the cells are still cuboidal. (C) Arrowheads show Fas2 signal in the apicolateral region of the posterior epithelium. (D) Surface view of the anterior epithelium during stretching. DE-cadherin highlights the zonula adherens, which is continuous at two cell borders (yellow arrow) and which disassembles at the four cell border (white arrow). White arrowhead marks a Fas2 puncta in the cytoplasm. D shows the Fas2 channel alone. Fas2 is no longer detectable at the membrane of the anterior follicle cells (arrow) and appears in puncta in more posterior cells. (E) Stage 9 egg chamber in which a UAS-Fas2-YFP transgene is overexpressed. Only the anterior-most follicle cells flatten, whereas the remaining anterior cells retain a cuboidal shape. Egg chamber morphology is affected as revealed by the elongated shape of the follicle (compare with stage 9 follicles in C and F). The inset shows the accumulation of Arm at the apical membrane. (F and G) Follicle cell clones mutant for the null allele Fas2 eb1112 marked by the absence of GFP. Mutant cells show no shape defects before (G) and during (F) morphogenesis. Processing of the images involved adjustment of  settings. Bars: (white) 50 µm; (black) 12.5 µm.</figDesc></figure>

(A) Double staining with an anti-Fas2 and an anti-GFP antibody detecting GR1-Gal4-driven UAS-Rab5-GFP. (B and C) Triple staining for Fas2-GFP, Rab5, and Rab11. B shows the Fas2 overlap with Rab5, and C shows the Fas2 overlap with Rab11. Examples of Fas2 vesicles that costain with one of the Rab proteins are marked by arrowheads. (D) Diagram showing Fas2-GFP vesicle numbers at different stages of oogenesis. Bars show the number of Fas2 vesicles counted in optical confocal sections divided by the number of analyzed cells. Below the graph, three follicles are depicted showing examples for the corresponding stages. Error bars indicate standard error. (E) Bars show the number Fas2-GFP vesicles that colocalize with Rab5 and Rab11 during different oogenesis stages. Fas2 vesicles that colocalize with both Rab5 and Rab11 were not included in the diagram. The data shown in D and E summarize the analysis of 15 egg chambers (five for each developmental stage). Processing of the images involved adjustment of  settings. Error bars indicate standard error. St, stage. Bars, 10 µm.</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_4"><head>Figure 5 .</head><label>5</label><figDesc>Fas2 endocytosis is impaired in Tao mutant cells. A, B, D, and E show optical confocal sections perpendicular to the apical-basal axis of the follicular epithelium. (A) Tao mutant cell clone (left) stained with an anti-Fas2 antibody showing increased Fas2 levels at the lateral membrane. In addition, tubular Fas2 extensions sprout from the lateral membrane (arrowheads). (B) Tao mutant clone in a follicle that has been incubated with fluorescently labeled dextran. Dextran signal is shown in black, and dotted line marks the clone border. Homozygous mutant cells are to the left. Dextran particles that were internalized into follicle cells vary in size. Right arrowhead shows an example for the minimal particle size counted in these experiments. Left arrowhead marks a bigger dextran particle. Analysis of four cell clones generated in three independent uptake experiments revealed a mean reduction of internalized dextran vesicles by 54%. (C) Diagram summarizing the results of three dextran uptake experiments (five clones) in which follicles were subsequently stained forFas2. Left bars show the total number of dextran vesicles per cell, and right bars show the numbers of cytoplasmic dextran vesicles that colocalize with Fas2. Error bars indicate standard error. A statistical test (t two-tailed paired test) was performed to analyze dextran internalization between wild-type (WT) and Tao mutant cells (P = 0.001) and dextran-Fas2 colocalization (P = 0.0171). (D) Follicle with a Tao clone incubated in dextran and subsequently stained with an anti-Fas2 antibody. Tao mutant cells are left, and wild-type cells are right of the white dotted line. Arrowheads indicate dextran vesicles that colocalize with Fas2. (E) Tao mutant cell clone stained for Fas2-GFP and Rab5. Tao mutant cells are to the left of the white dotted line. Fas2 and Rab5 channels alone are shown in the right two images. Examples for cytoplasmic Fas2-Rab5 vesicles are marked by arrowheads, whereas membrane-associated vesicular structures are marked by arrows.
