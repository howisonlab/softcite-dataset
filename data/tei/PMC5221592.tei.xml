			<abstract>
				<p>Photobleaching event counting is a single-molecule fluorescence technique that is increasingly being used to determine the stoichiometry of protein and RNA complexes composed of many subunits in vivo as well as in vitro. By tagging protein or RNA subunits with fluorophores, activating them, and subsequently observing as the fluorophores photobleach, one obtains information on the number of subunits in a complex. The noise properties in a photobleaching time trace depend on the number of active fluorescent subunits. Thus, as fluorophores stochastically photobleach, noise properties of the time trace change stochastically, and these varying noise properties have created a challenge in identifying photobleaching steps in a time trace. Although photobleaching steps are often detected by eye, this method only works for high individual fluorophore emission signal-to-noise ratios and small numbers of fluorophores. With filtering methods or currently available algorithms, it is possible to reliably identify photobleaching steps for up to 20-30 fluorophores and signal-tonoise ratios down to ∼1. Here we present a new Bayesian method of counting steps in photobleaching time traces that takes into account stochastic noise variation in addition to complications such as overlapping photobleaching events that may arise from fluorophore interactions, as well as on-off blinking. Our method is capable of detecting ≥50 photobleaching steps even for signal-to-noise ratios as low as 0.1, can find up to ≥500 steps for more favorable noise profiles, and is computationally inexpensive.</p>

That is, they irreversibly photochemically transition to a state no longer detectable by fluorescence <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(White and Stelzer, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Lippincott-Schwartz et al., 2003)</ref>. Although photobleaching can be a nuisance in single-particle tracking experiments, it is critical to other experimental approaches, such as fluorescence recovery after photobleaching <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Lippincott-Schwartz et al., 2003)</ref>, photoactivated localization microscopy (PALM), and photobleaching event counting <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Lippincott-Schwartz et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Leake et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Ulbrich and Isacoff, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Coffman and Wu, 2012)</ref>. As its name implies, photobleaching event counting is used to enumerate molecules by monitoring how the light intensity in some region decreases by quanta as individual fluorophores photobleach <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Shu et al., 2007)</ref>. This can be very useful in quantifying the stoichiometry of biological complexes in live cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Leake et al., 2006)</ref>.</p><p>Briefly, photobleaching event counting works by tagging biomolecule subunits-often genetically <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Durisic et al., 2014)</ref>-with fluorophores. Fluorophores within an illuminated region of interest (ROI) are then all simultaneously activated and monitored as they subsequently photobleach. As each fluorophore photobleaches, the fluorescence intensity over a ROI drops in a step-like pattern. Each step-like Brute-force application of many methods, including our own, that rank-order models by evaluating and comparing model posteriors for all possible models (i.e., all possible numbers of steps with any possible step location) is computationally prohibitive. Instead, our method is efficient in its implementation because it uses a precursor algorithm to eliminate from consideration a large number of unlikely models. It then considers and compares only probable models.</p><p>This two-step approach reduces the computational complexity and makes it possible for us to apply our method to photobleaching traces with as many as 100+ fluorophores, depending on the level of noise. In fact, using our method, we show that even for low SNR, we can count up to 50+ fluorophores and locate photobleaching events in a time trace with an accuracy surpassing that of methods currently available. We also show that we can extract biological conclusions by applying our method to sample experimental data sets.</p><p>We previously proposed a solution to the single-molecule counting problem using PALM <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Rollins et al., 2015)</ref>, in which we inferred the (stochastic) blinking properties of fluorophores "on the fly" in order to avoid overcounting fluorophores-and thus protein subunits-in an ROI. Although PALM provides greater spatial resolution than photobleaching event counting, allowing us to characterize complexes localized down to the tens of nanometers <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Watanabe et al., 2011)</ref>, PALM analysis is computationally intensive. The advantage of photobleaching, and the reason we focus on this here, is that photobleaching event counting has the potential to reveal the stoichiometry of complexes involving hundreds of proteins. Unfortunately, current analysis methods have limited its applicability to complexes with only a handful of subunits. As we show, complicated fluorophore photophysics can be accommodated in our approach. Thus our work even suggests that future experiments may want to focus on biological problems, such as characterizing larger protein complexes, rather than engineering photophysical properties of fluorophores used in photobleaching event counting to reduce blinking, which may now be treated theoretically in postprocessing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>METHODOLOGY A brief sketch of our approach</head><p>A photobleaching time trace is a data set consisting of fluorescence intensity measurements taken at constant time intervals ∆t and decrease corresponds to a single or possibly multiple overlapping photobleaching events. The total number of photobleaching events can then be used, in principle, to determine the total number of fluorophore-tagged molecules present within the ROI <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Das et al., 2007)</ref>.</p><p>For instance, photobleaching event counting has been used to quantify the stoichiometry of a number of complexes involved in the bacterial flagellar switch (FliM; <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Delalez et al., 2010)</ref>, eukaryotic flagella <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Engel et al., 2009)</ref>, and the point centromere <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Lawrimore et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Coffman et al., 2011)</ref>.

One key challenge is that the magnitude of the noise changes stochastically along with the number of active fluorophores. Thus a detection algorithm assuming constant noise properties is inappropriate for photobleaching.</p><p>In addition, noise also arises from background fluorescence <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Ulbrich and Isacoff, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Coffman and Wu, 2012)</ref>, variable fluorophore emission <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Ulbrich and Isacoff, 2007)</ref>, and fluorophore blinking <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bagshaw and Cherny, 2006)</ref> driven by core fluorophore instabilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Drobizhev et al., 2012)</ref>. For this reason, photobleaching event counting is typically used only in systems with few fluorophores (&lt;10), for which signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is high. Here SNR is defined as μ f /σ f , where μ f and σ f are the mean and SD of the emission intensity of the single fluorophore, respectively. For instance, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Ulbrich and Isacoff (2007)</ref>, five subunits was the limit past which detection of discrete steps, done by eye, became difficult. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> shows an example of a photobleaching trace along with its increasing noise level as more fluorophores become active.</p><p>Earlier counting methods used filters-such as the median filter or the Chung-Kennedy filter <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Leake et al., 2006)</ref>-as well as binning and constructing pairwise distance distributions <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Svoboda et al., 1993)</ref> and other techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Coffman and Wu, 2012)</ref> and were able to count ∼10 steps.

Although SIC and Student's t-test algorithms improve how many steps may be detected, visual inspection, supplemented by filtering methods, is still often used <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Engel et al., 2009)</ref>.</p><p>One shortcoming of these previous methods is that they do not directly account for on-off blinking or stochastically varying noise. Here we present a Bayesian approach to counting that directly addresses the foregoing challenges. Conceptually, our method uses a likelihood function that is adapted to treat the physics of the noise properties expected in photobleaching and introduces a prior that corrects for systematic biases that would otherwise arise from simple likelihood maximization.</p><p>FIGURE 1: Synthetic photobleaching time trace for 50 fluorophores, with μ f /σ f = 10 for the single fluorophore, illustrating how noise obscures steps when many fluorophores are active at the start of the trace. Although it is easy to resolve individual steps late in the trace when fluorophore numbers are low, for &gt;10 or so fluorophores, the steps are strongly obscured by additive noise. Here μ f = 2.0, σ f = 0.2, μ b = 20.0, and σ b = 0 (quantities defined in the text). Both time and fluorescence intensity are in arbitrary units.</p><p>state (number of active fluorophores) i and not the number of times j that state is visited, and so we can drop j for notational simplicity. The quantities μ f , σ f , μ b , and σ b (where the subscript f designates single-fluorophore values and the subscript b designates background) are relatively easy to determine experimentally from the end of the photobleaching time trace. For these reasons, we will assume that these quantities are known (or, equivalently, that priors over their values are sharply peaked). Finally, the prime on the first product in Eq. 1 denotes a restricted product, meaning that i does not necessarily run through all the states from 0 to I. This is because some states may not be visited at all (if two photobleaching events happen simultaneously), and thus J i may be 0 for some i's. For a concise explanation of all notation, see <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>.</p><p>Our likelihood describes the probability that each data point in each ϕ ij interval is drawn from a normal distribution of mean μ i and variance σ i 2 . However, we cannot simply maximize our likelihood, since, as is well known, likelihood maximization would overfit the data by favoring too many steps in the photobleaching time trace <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Kalafut and Visscher, 2008)</ref>. Typically, to prevent overfitting, model selection criteria-including the SIC <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Schwarz, 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Cavanaugh and Neath, 1999)</ref>, the Akaike information criterion (AIC; <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Akaike, 1974)</ref>, and others <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Kadane and Lazar, 2004</ref>; reviewed most recently in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Tavakoli et al., 2016)</ref>-compare different models on the basis of 1) their fit to the data and 2) the number of parameters (i.e., the complexity) of the model <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Claeskens and Hjort, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Tavakoli et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Our Bayesian approach uses model averaging-a method that also inspired the SIC-to penalize complex models. The idea behind model averaging is simple: the likelihood function depends on a number of parameters (models), and, by averaging over these models, we account for models that are both good and bad fits to the data. Fundamentally, this process penalizes complexity by weighing into consideration models that are poor fits to the data <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Schwarz, 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Tavakoli et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>More concretely, we define a posterior probability for the model with parameters θ,</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">D D D D P P P ( | ) ( | ) θ θ θ θ θ θ ( ) ∝<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where P(θ ) is a prior, P(D|θ ) is a likelihood, and the proportionality arises because we dropped the normalization, P(D).</p><p>We then split the parameter vector θ into two groups, θ 0 and θ ′, where θ 0 are parameters that we integrate over, as their values are unknown and irrelevant. In other words, we take a weighted sum of the posterior over every possible value that these parameters could take:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">D D D D P P P d ( | ) | ,<label>, ( ) ( )</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">′ ∝ ′ ′<label>(3)</label></formula><p>For discrete parameters, the integral is understood as a sum. The marginal posterior now only depends on the remaining parameters, θ ′, that we want to determine and thus not integrate over.</p><p>The marginal posterior obtained from Eq. 3 is our starting point. Our goal is to find the model that maximizes this marginal posterior, where the likelihood appearing in Eq. 3 is given by Eq. 1 and the prior, which we now describe in more detail, depends on the parameters θ = (s, <ref type="bibr">K, m, arr, μ, σ, γ )</ref>.</p><p>Here s are the event locations, K is the number of steps (i.e., discrete jumps in the data), m is the total number of events (defined as single-fluorophore intensity changes; from now on, when we refer to events, we exclusively mean these single-fluorophore intensity changes), arr is the number of possible arrangements of single-level events m (which we later ascribe to fluorescence intensity changes ordered in sequence by ascending acquisition time. Traces are typically obtained when fluorophore-tagged molecules of interest are illuminated at some time, say t = 0, and then monitored until all fluorophores have photobleached.

The maximum number of fluorophores that can ever be active at the same time is three.

We also dropped the hyperparameter, γ, dependence from all conditionals except P(m|K, γ ) because γ couples only m to K. The factor P(s|arr, K, m) in Eq. 4 refers to the locations of the steps given the arrangements, number of steps, and number of events. Because we have no prior expectation on how step locations are affected by arr, K, and m, we always assume a flat (constant) prior P <ref type="bibr">(s|arr, K, m)</ref>. The form of the remaining prior terms depends on the conditions of our problem, which we motivate in the next two subsections.</p><p>Illustrative example: a model selection criterion assuming no event blinking or overlap. Here, as an illustrative example, we derive a simpler model selection criterion using the steps highlighted earlier in the absence of blinking and overlap. Although this will not be useful in finding the model for a real photobleaching trace in of magnitude μ = μ f ) on K steps <ref type="figure">(Figure 3</ref>), μ and σ are the mean and SD, respectively, and γ is a hyperparameter discussed in the Appendix.</p><p>Taking all of the above into consideration, we write the prior as FIGURE 3: Two models can have the same number of steps and even have those steps occur at identical locations, and yet different m's and arr's may fit the data very differently. (A) m refers to the total number of single fluorophore intensity level changes. In both cases, K = 3 (three steps), but on the left, these are made up of a single, a double, and again a single event for a total m = 4, whereas on the right, the three steps are made up of a triple, a double, and a single event, and so m = 6. (B) arr refers to the different ways in which m events can be arranged in K steps. In both cases, K = 4 and m = 7 but arr is different. On the left, the first three steps are double-event ones and the fourth is single, whereas on the right, we have in succession a triple, a double, and two single events. Note that neither m nor arr is location dependent.  Typically, if a fit to the data is bad, the likelihood function and, by extension, the marginal posterior are small. However, if we were to overestimate the number of active fluorophores at some point in the time trace, the expected variance would also grow (if we assume that both means and variances grow with i, as we did in Eq. 7). As uncertainty grows, poor fits to the data do not penalize the likelihood function as heavily as if the SD were small.</p><p>Concretely, what this means is that if we introduce the possibility of overlapping events, then our marginal posterior, as shown in Eq. 7, will 1) tend to overestimate the number of active fluorophores and 2) be consistently biased toward maximizing event overlap.</p><p>To address these problems, we need to incorporate the appropriate combinatorial factors that will inform the prior on how improbable it is for events to overlap. For example, we should be able to quantify, given no data, what the a priori odds are that the only two steps in a time trace containing 100 data points, say, overlap.</p><p>The next section treats blinking and overlap and deals with this key issue.</p></div>

Some states may be visited more than once (when blinking occurs).</p><p>3. Some states may not be visited at all. For example, if overlapping photobleaching events force the system to go directly from having i + 1 to having i − 1 active fluorophores without ever visiting state i.</p><p>Under these conditions, our likelihood is given by Eq. 1. Our full prior is given in Eq. 4. We assume the same priors over μ and σ assumed in the last subsection.</p><p>However, to correct for the bias we mentioned in the previous section on overlapping events, we introduce a combinatorial prior on P(arr|m, K):</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">P arr m K K d m m K | , ! ! 1 1 y m K y 1 ∏ ( )= − −       = − (9)</formula><p>where m − K is the maximum number of events that can overlap, and dy are the degeneracies of steps with y-level "occupancy." Further details are in the Appendix. Intuitively, this quantifies how unlikely it is to have many steps with multiple overlapping events. In addition, we specify priors on P(K), P(m|K, γ), and P(γ) as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">P K e K P mK e P ! , | , ,and c onstant K m K / λ γ γ ( ) ( ) ( ) = = ∝ λ γ − −<label>(10)</label></formula><p>Here the prior over K is a Poisson distribution, which depends on the hyperparameter λ, the rate. In theory, our a priori assumption should have been that we have an inhomogeneous Poisson process with a higher rate expected at the start of the time trace (when many fluorophores are a priori expected to be active) and a lower rate expected at the end of time trace (when many fluorophores are a priori expected to have photobleached). Under these assumptions, we can estimate the precise form of λ and how it depends on another hyperparameter (the number of a priori expected active fluorophores at the start of the trace). In practice, in data analysis, an average-fixed value-for λ suffices.</p><p>which these complications are present, it serves a pedagogical purpose by illustrating how we reach a marginal posterior starting from a likelihood and set of assumptions that are built into a prior. More explicitly, our assumptions for this subsection are as follows. 1) Events do not overlap with each other (i.e., no two fluorophores photobleach at the same time, i.e., within the same data acquisition interval; <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Ulbrich and Isacoff, 2007)</ref>. Simultaneous photobleaching is of particular concern for high fluorophore numbers and, as a consequence of the stochasticity of photobleaching and the finite sampling rate of instrumentation, cannot in practice be completely avoided. 2) Blinking <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Annibale et al., 2011)</ref>, due to either triplet states or long-lived dark states <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Ha and Tinnefeld, 2012)</ref> arising from fluorophore conformational changes or interactions with the environment-where a fluorophore turns off reversibly and then reactivates-does not arise. In other words, at t = 0, all fluorophores are in the active state and, subsequently, may only irreversibly photobleach.</p><p>Because we have no blinking or overlapping events, the total number of events, m, in the trace is equal to the number of steps, K, and also equal to the total number of identical fluorophores, I, in an ROI, which is also the total number of states. The quantity arr has no meaning here and need not be considered (only one arrangement with one event per step is possible).</p><p>For this simple example, the likelihood of the model is</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">D D s s P K x | , 1 2 exp 2 i K l n i l i i 0 1 2 2 i ∏∏ σ π µ σ ( ) ( ) = − −       = = (5)</formula><p>Next, for our prior given by Eq. 4, because m = K and the quantity arr has no meaning, we set the prior terms as follows: P(arr|m, K) and P(K) to constants; P(m|K, γ ) ∝ d(m−K), and, thus, P(γ ) to a constant.</p><p>In our prior, however, we do assume that the photophysics of our problem properly informs μ and σ.

We then insert this likelihood and prior into our expression for our marginal posterior, Eq. 3, and subsequently marginalize the resulting posterior over all quantities except those that we want to use to discriminate between models, namely {s, K}. The resulting marginal posterior is simply</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">∏∏ π σ σ µ µ σ σ ( ) ∝ + − − − +       = = s s D D P K i x i i i ( , | ) 1 2 ( ) exp 2( ) i K l n f b l f b f b 0 1 2 2 2 2 2 i (6)</formula><p>where s are the step locations, a subset of K (out of a total N) data points.

In <ref type="figure">Figure  4B</ref>, we show that the model maximizing the marginal posterior that accounts for the photophysics in μ and σ via the appropriate prior but otherwise ignores blinking or overlapping events, Eq. 7, has two problems: 1) it overestimates the number of active fluorophores, and 2) it stacks events. Both problems arise for the reason we describe at the end of Illustrative example: a model selection criterion assuming no event blinking or overlap. In <ref type="figure">Figure 4C</ref>, we add explicit priors over P <ref type="bibr">(K)</ref> and P(arr|m, K), which improve the model fit to the data primarily by reducing the number of events stacked. However, the number of active fluorophores is still overestimated without a prior on P(m|K, γ). Finally, in <ref type="figure">Figure 4D</ref>, we show that the model criterion given by Eq. 11 improves the fit for these low-noise data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Algorithm description</head><p>In practice, computing and comparing the marginal posterior, or equivalently Eq. 11, for all conceivable models is not computationally feasible. To reduce the computational cost, nested (also called greedy) approaches are used <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Chen et al., 2014)</ref>, in which, for instance, a single trial step is placed at a point in time and a selection criterion, such as the SIC or AIC, is calculated. If a single step provides a value for the criterion that is lower than the criterion with no step, then this step is retained, and the process is repeated (holding the first step fixed) to find the possible location of a second step. More steps are subsequently found in this way until any single additional step only increases the value of the criterion. Although this approximate treatment is relatively efficient, it still requires roughly O(NK) calculations, where N is the total number of data points and K, as before, is the total number of steps.</p><p>Instead of this classic nested approach, to improve computational efficiency and accuracy (defined later), we employ the following three-step method.</p><p>Step 1: We find the mean and SD of the single fluorophore and background from the data, if not already known experimentally. In other words, assuming μ f , σ f , μ b , and σ b are a priori unknown, we determine these quantities by employing a version of a greedy algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Kalafut and Visscher, 2008)</ref> to locate the last steps in the trace-that is, where the noise level is lowest -that provide us with an estimate for μ f , σ f , μ b , and σ b .</p><p>Step 2: Eliminate unlikely models. We propose a principled method to eliminate a vast number of improbable models (e.g., such as the extreme example of having all fluorophores simultaneously photobleach), leaving our criterion, Eq. 11, to evaluate the relative merit of a comparatively smaller number of candidate models. To do so, we first subdivide our time trace into G windows of n c data points each. The first window is defined as the window at the very end of the time trace. Now, knowing μ f , σ f , μ b , and σ b from Step 1, we have an estimate for how many fluorophores are active in the first window. As we begin moving in reverse time order-eventually toward the start of the trace (Gth window)-we may estimate how many fluorophores must be active in each window.</p><p>Next our prior over γ penalizes deviations of m away from K. Because the strength of the penalty γ is unknown, we integrate this hyperparameter starting from some minimal acceptable value γ 0 to infinity. Further details are provided in the Appendix. As a final note, because we set λ to a fixed value that we do not integrate over in our prior over K, for notational simplicity, we do not introduce a prior over λ.</p><p>Inserting our priors for μ and σ and Eqs. 9 and 10 into Eq. 4 returns our full prior.</p><p>Next, inserting this full prior and the likelihood into Eq. 3 and following the appropriate marginalization over γ detailed in the Appendix and all integrations over d-functions, we recover our marginal posterior:</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">∑ ∑ ∑ θ θ σ σ µ µ σ σ λ γ ( ) ( ) (<label>) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_17">− = + + − − +       + − − − − + − +       + − + + − + + − + −     ϕ ϕ = = = − ϕ D D P n i x i i i K m K K m d m K K m K m K A 2 ln '| l n 2 ln ln ! ln ! ln 1! l n ! 2 1 ln 2 ln 1 ln K f b l n l f b f b y m K y 0 2 2 1 2 2 2 0 0<label>(11)</label></formula><p>where we dropped all constants that do not depend on model variables and defined A m K m K e 2 ( 1) -/K 0 = − + − − + γ . Equation 11 is the criterion we use in model selection. As a simple sanity check, we note that Eq. 11 reduces to Eq. 7 when m = K with the exception of the single term -K ln λ, which arises out of the prior for P(K), which we had taken as constant in deriving Eq. 7.</p><p>An example illustrating the key role of the prior is shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>. In <ref type="figure">Figure 4A</ref>, we first show a model that maximizes the marginal posterior but does not consider blinking or overlapping FIGURE 4: Our method's accuracy increases as more prior terms are specified explicitly. We used low-noise experimental data from the Peterman and Wuite groups to test the effects of our prior. (A) No blinking or overlapping events are considered, and we integrate over all unknown means and variance to obtain the marginal posterior. Although some steps are found accurately, others are not, and both the double-step and the reactivation events are predictably missed. (B) Here we use the marginal posterior given in Eq. 7, which, as expected, shows event stacking and overestimation of the number of active fluorophores for the reasons described in Illustrative example: a model selection criterion assuming no event blinking or overlap. (C) Here we add the explicit form of the priors for P(K) and P(arr|m, K). The overestimation of fluorophore numbers problem is resolved, although the algorithm still gets the event stacking wrong, causing a step to be missed. (D) Our full posterior, Eq. 11. Results are excellent compared with A-C.</p><p>windows introduce error due to small number statistics and should be avoided.</p><p>Step 3: Precisely determine step location and numbers. We now use the information from Step 2 to determine the most likely event locations. Scanning in reverse the window segmented data, we compute the numerical value of Eq. 11 for all possible event locations within a window, knowing, from the previous step, that the most likely number of events occurring within the window is α − β. Assuming some error in our Step 2 estimate of α − β events, we compute the value for all possible events in the range <ref type="bibr">[</ref></p><formula xml:id="formula_18">(α − β) − w, (α − β ) + w].</formula><p>If the value of Eq. 11 at one of the limits of the search range (say, (α − β) + w ) proves to be the smallest, we recenter our search on that value and calculate values for our criterion with ±w again (continuing the example, in</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">[(α − β ), (α − β ) + 2w]).</formula><p>Comparing these values, we assign the one with the minimum value as the most probable local model. Like i max and n c , the range of events to be considered, w, is set by the user on the basis of computational efficiency. Benchmarking on synthetic data reveals that small w's decrease accuracy and computational cost, whereas large ones do the reverse. Note that w and i max are the same concept, in that both designate the range of our search for the most likely number of active fluorophores, doing so in Steps 1 and 2, respectively. However, we denote them differently because the much heavier computational demands of Step 3 necessitate that w be much smaller than i max . Simply put, Step 2 is so much simpler computationally that imax can easily be in the hundreds, whereas a w &gt;10 or 20 becomes computationally prohibitive.</p><p>To summarize, after determining μ f , σ f , μ b , and σ b in Step 1, in Step 2, all windows are scanned in reverse order, and an estimate of the number of steps in each window is made. We then move to</p><p>Step 3 and calculate the most likely model. A schematic of our algorithm appears in <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>. For a total number of G windows of size n c with α − β events per window, we must compute the criterion value a number of times that is roughly of the order Gn c (α − β ). If we set N = 100,000, I = 50, G = 1000, n c = 100, and α − β = 5, we get that a nested algorithm requires NI = 5 × 10 6 calculations, whereas our method requires Gn c (α − β ) = 5 × 10 5 calculations. In other words, our approach reduces computational requirements by an order of magnitude. In reality, because photobleaching is an exponential process, the vast majority of windows especially toward the end of the trace will have few or no events. Therefore Step 3 will either not need to be used or will have to discriminate between very few candidate models for those windows, so our approach is even faster than this upper bound. For typical photobleaching time traces with up to 10 3 data points, our algorithm works in seconds. For data sets that have between 1000 and 10,000 data points our algorithm runs in seconds to a few minutes. For very large data sets, our algorithm works faster than other methods we have tested. For example, in a test of a very large data set that was specifically designed to be hard to fit, performed on an ordinary MacBook Pro 2.5 GHz laptop, the Tdetector2 algorithm, which is based on Student's twosample t test as implemented in MATLAB by <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Chen et al. (2014)</ref>, required ∼7 d to run the 5 × 10 4 -data point data set with 50 steps; our method needed 17 h.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Applicability of our approach: theoretical and computational limitations</head><p>There are two major constraints to our method's applicability:</p><p>1. We assume that each individual fluorophore is independent and has identical properties μ f and σ f that do not change in time. This</p><p>To estimate the fluorophore number in each window, we note that any data point along a photobleaching time trace must ultimately be sampled from a normal probability distribution, p i , of mean iμ f + μ b and variance iσ f</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">2 + σ b 2 .</formula><p>For each sequence of n c data points, we can quantify the likelihood that all n c data points were sampled from p i . This is the likelihood that all points in that window were sampled during a time when i fluorophores were active, given the data in the window. The most likely number of fluorophores active in each window is the specific value of i for which this likelihood is maximum.</p><p>We assume that in the first window (which is the last timewise, since we are moving through the data in reverse), all data points are sampled from p 0 . We then move to the next window, where we compare the values of the likelihoods for a certain range of i values based on the number of fluorophores that were active in the previous window we examined. For example, if in the previous window the most likely number of active fluorophores was k (so that the data were drawn from p k ), we search the distributions {p k−i max , p k+1−i max ,…, p k−1+i max , p k+i max }, where i max is set to some arbitrary but reasonable value depending on k. If k − i max &lt; 0, we stop searching at p 0 since there can never be a negative number of active fluorophores.</p><p>Any time two neighboring windows are found to have different numbers of most likely active fluorophores, say p α and p β , where we take α &gt; β, then α − β events have probably occurred. Moving in reverse through the trace in this manner, we estimate the most likely number of events that occurred in any window ( <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>). Note that dividing up the data set into small windows increases both accuracy and computational time. However, very small FIGURE 5: How Step 2 of our algorithm works: The synthetic data (blue) are divided into G = 6 windows (black squares). For each window, we calculate i likelihoods. Each of these is the likelihood that all data points within the window were taken when i fluorophores were active. Once we have all i likelihoods, we compare them and assign the window the number of fluorophores for which the likelihood is maximized. In this example, Step 2 has determined that the data points in windows 0 and 1 most likely belong to the p 0 distribution (no fluorophores active, only background), the data points in windows 2 and 3 most likely belong to the p 1 distribution (one fluorophore active), and the data points in windows 4 and 5 most likely belong to the p 2 and p 4 distributions, respectively, which means that two fluorophores are active in window 4 and four in 5. When Step 3 of our algorithm treats this trace, it will use the results from Step 2 to focus on reasonable preselected models. For example, it will focus primarily on models that have two to four active fluorophores in windows 4 and 5. yields correct results. Still, if both aSNR and number of data points between steps decrease, confidence in our algorithm's results should decrease as well. For most systems, the number of data points acquired between possible steps is a matter of experimental design. Whereas fluorophore photobleaching is a random process and events with separation &lt;50 data points are bound to occur, by tuning, for instance, laser intensity, an experiment can be designed to ensure that the majority of events have a separation of &gt;50 data points on average.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Benchmarking on synthetic data</head><p>To test our algorithm's performance, we first test our method on synthetic data sets in which the actual step locations are known. We start by discussing qualitative comparisons and subsequently define metrics that will allow us to make quantitative comparisons.</p><p>All data sets were created using the Gillespie algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Gillespie, 1977)</ref> by starting with N fluorophores each with prespecified kinetics (photobleaching and blinking-on/ off rates). We then created a trace, which we call the noiseless or denoised time trace, by plotting the total number of active fluorophores multiplied by μ f and then added noise.</p><p>Once we generated these data, we ask whether we can determine the number of steps, K, and their locations, s. We tested various choices of hyperparameters and user-input parameters (n, i max , w, etc., as defined in our algorithm) for the best results as quantified by the metrics defined later. To measure our algorithm's performance and compare it to alternate tools, we tested various methods (including our own) on our synthetic data sets.</p><p>The performance metrics we use are based on the number and location of events-which, we recall, are single-fluorophore intensity level changes-because a step may be made up of more than one single event when considering overlapping events. Our metrics are defined as follows:</p><p>1. Precision (PR): the ratio of the number of true events found (exact or displaced; see later discussion) to the total number of events found.</p><p>2. Sensitivity (SE): the ratio of the number of true events found (exact or displaced) to the total number of true events.</p><p>3. Offset (OF): the average distance (in terms of data points) between the location of a true event and the location of the found event. This is a metric that can capture the cases in which an event is identified close to, but not quite on, its true location, in which case we call it a displaced true event.</p><p>We identify an event as a displaced true event only if the event found is within a distance d (in terms of data points) from the true event. We set d to be the minimum of 50 data points or 0.1%N, where N is the total number of data points in an entire trace. If more than one event is found within d of the true event, we take the closest one as the displaced event. If both are equally distant assumes that the fluorophore maturation process is complete for all fluorophores; that, following a blinking event, the fluorophore fluoresces just as it did earlier; that all fluorophores are imaged on nearby z-planes; and that the orientation of fluorophores that are not freely rotating does not affect their fluorescence properties <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Backlund et al., 2014)</ref>. For example, for a large complex, one can imagine that the observed fluorescence intensity of a particular fluorophore within that complex might depend on the fluorophore's orientation and location within the complex, so that not all photobleaching events give rise to an equal μ f <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Backlund et al., 2014)</ref>, or, if a fluorophore is not freely rotating, the number of detected photons emitted by the fluorophore might depend on the angle between their orientation and the detector, which could change over time. We might deal with this challenge by ascribing a prior over the μ f 's informed by the physics of the problem and integrating over a range of acceptable μ f 's in our posterior.</p><p>2. Our method is only as good as the data. With insufficient data, step locations can no longer be reliably determined. Thus we assume that the data resolution is high enough that even at the start of the trace, the number of data points between fluorescence level changes is at least 50. This number of data points between steps is sufficient for adjusted SNR (aSNR), where aSNR = 2(μ ϕ +1 − μ ϕ )/(σ ϕ +1 + σ ϕ ), and ϕ is an interval (for the full definition of aSNR, see Results) down to 0.25. If the aSNR is larger, we need fewer data points between steps to be accurate. On the contrary, if the aSNR is smaller, we need larger numbers of data points between steps for our algorithm to accurately locate them.</p><p>Having few data points between events runs the risk of introducing small-number statistics errors in our method, primarily in the form of having close-by real steps confused for double steps. However, it is often the case that, even when the aSNR is low (&lt;0.25) and the data points between steps &lt;50, our algorithm FIGURE 6: The three steps of our algorithm can be broken down into a step-by-step chart. In this schematic, n c is the window size, i max is the maximum number of fluorophores simultaneously considered in a window, w is the maximum number of single-level fluorescence change events the code will consider (essentially setting m = w, but only within one window), and γ 0 is a hyperparameter cutoff. These four quantities are the user-defined parameters that our approach requires. Note that since the trace has been reversed, the "first" window and the "first" two steps of the algorithm discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Kalafut and Visscher (2008)</ref> are timewise the last window and the latest two steps in the trace.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis of the experimental data sets</head><p>We present the analysis on five data sets:</p><p>1. Data set I (published data): We used green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged mitotic centromere-associated kinase (MCAK) protein provided by the <ref type="bibr">Walczak group (Ems-McClung et al., 2013)</ref>. MCAK proteins-members of the kinesin-13 protein family-are involved in spindle assembly during mitosis, chromosome segregation, and error correction <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Walczak et al., 2013)</ref>. MCAK is also unique among kinesins because it can bind to microtubule ends directly from solution and rapidly diffuse along the microtubule; once attached to the microtubule's end, it causes a conformational change that results in microtubule depolymerization and its own detachment. It is known <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Walczak et al., 2013)</ref> that when Aurora B kinase phosphorylates MCAK, the latter's depolymerization activity is inhibited. To discover the mechanism of inhibition, MCAK proteins were tagged with GFP, and photobleaching event counting was used to see how quickly they detached from a microtubule.</p><p>2. Data set II (published data): We used Alexa Fluor 55-tagged RAD51 proteins provided by the Peterman and Wuite groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(van Mameren et al., 2009)</ref>. RAD51 is a recombinase protein. It catalyzes strand exchange between homologous DNA segments <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Sung et al., 2003)</ref>, a key meiotic event that assures genetic diversity <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(van Mameren et al., 2009)</ref>. RAD51 forms a helical filament around single-stranded DNA; this filament then locates the homologous double-stranded DNA, invades it, and catalyzes the strand exchange needed to create a joint molecule, following which the RAD51 filament disassembles to enable other proteins to conclude the process. The disassembly from the filament requires hydrolysis of ATP bound at the interface between adjacent RAD51 monomers. To determine the precise disassembly mechanism, RAD51 monomers were labeled with Alexa Fluor 555 and photobleaching time traces taken to determine the number of monomers per filament and their detachment rate from the filament.</p><p>3. Data sets III-V (new data): Here we used our method on data sets acquired during experiments intended to investigate how drug delivery systems (DDS) work at the cellular level. A challenge in the optimization of DDS is the ability to accurately quantify from the true event, we conservatively accept neither as a displaced event and consider the true event as missed. If a step found is not of size (number of single-level events) equal to the corresponding true step, we only consider correct the number of events up to overlap size. For example, if there is a triple step in the trace but we only find a double step, we consider two events found and one event missed. Similarly, if there is, say, a reactivation event and we find a double step, we consider three events missed.</p><p>4. Adjusted signal-to-noise ratio (aSNR): defined as 2(μ ϕ + 1 − μ ϕ )/ (σ ϕ + 1 + σ ϕ ), where μ ϕ and σ ϕ are the mean and SD of the ϕ th interval (recall that an interval is the stretch of data points between two identified steps). This is a step-specific measure of the noise that, contrary to the simpler μ f /σ f metric, captures the increasing difficulty of identifying a step when there are many active fluorophores (i.e., at the start of a trace). aSNR is given as a range from its value at the trace end to its value at the trace start.</p><p>Under these metrics, optimal performance implies unity precision and sensitivity (all true events found and no false events found) and zero offset (all events found at their precise locations), whereas the range of aSNR is a measure of how hard a data set is to fit. These metrics can be used to compare algorithm performance on synthetic data sets but cannot be used on real experimental data, where the true steps are unknown. <ref type="figure">Figure 7A</ref> shows the example of a time trace with many fluorophores initially active (the black line is the theoretical noiseless trace). <ref type="figure">Figure 7B</ref> shows the data from <ref type="figure">Figure 7A</ref> with the results from</p><p>Step 2 of our algorithm offset in red and the results of our full algorithm offset in blue. Both blue and red show a spurious blinking event at the start of the trace, where the noise level is highest. Otherwise, blue matches the ground truth (black) almost exactly, whereas red is only an approximation. This shows how Step 2 of our algorithm successfully approximates the real denoised model, thus greatly reducing the number of alternate models our Step 3 needs to consider. The net effect of producing a good approximation such as this is that computational resources and time are substantially reduced. In <ref type="figure">Figure 7C</ref>, we overlap the ground truth (black) with the results (green) from our full algorithm to further illustrate how precise our results are. FIGURE 7: Example of our method applied to a data set with high numbers of fluorophores and correspondingly high noise levels. (A) Large numbers of fluorophores produce a very noisy trace (synthetic data). This is an example of a noisy signal (blue) around the denoised trace (black) for synthetic data. We show the first 104 data points from a 2 × 10 5 data point trace in which 50 fluorophores photobleached. For this data set, μ f = 2.0, σ f = 0.2, μ b = 20.0, and σ b = 0.0.

We find all steps with (in some cases) minor offsets only, so our sensitivity is optimal (SE = 1), and offset is very good (OF = 0.84). At very high fluorophore numbers, our algorithm detects one spurious blinking event, but that is the only error, and so that precision is near perfect (PR = 0.99). aSNR = 10-0.2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data set analysis results</head><p>Having benchmarked our method on synthetic data, we now summarize our method's analysis of all experimental data sets in <ref type="figure">Figures  8-12</ref>. For data set I <ref type="figure">(Figure 8</ref>), our algorithm identifies four fluorescence levels (including the background-only level). For data set II <ref type="figure">(Figure 9</ref>), our method finds two steps and determines that the very first data points in the trace arise from noise and not a third fluorophore. Considering that both traces have high SNR (∼2 and ∼4, respectively), we can verify our algorithm's findings by eye.</p><p>For data sets III in <ref type="figure">Figure 10</ref> and IV in <ref type="figure">Figure 11</ref>, our method's results respectively conflict and agree with the results of the original analysis method, which was a combination of noise filtering and estimation of fluorescence levels identifiable by eye (a fuller description of the original analysis method can be found in later subsections on Trace extraction and Data analysis). Whereas this original analysis method concluded that there are three steps in <ref type="figure">Figure 10</ref>, our method finds seven steps because it identified a blinking event. On the contrary, for <ref type="figure">Figure 11</ref>, our and the original analysis method agree on four steps. We note that errors due to small-number statistics when processing data set IV are more likely than when processing data set III. We therefore have more confidence in our analysis of data set III, despite the fact that our method's results disagree with the original data analysis method. For data set V in <ref type="figure">Figure 12</ref>, our method finds &gt;30 steps, including multiple reactivation and overlapping events. The latter are particularly prevalent early in the trace, which is expected if there are many fluorophores active to begin with and the data acquisition rate is relatively low. This is because photobleaching events are more frequent early in a trace, and if more than one event occurs between successive measurements, they will register as an overlapping event. It is worth noting that the original filtering-and-eye analysis method found this data set intractable and could not resolve any steps.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Comparison to other methods</head><p>Our method treats blinking, stochastic noise variations, and overlapping events that may arise from interacting fluorophores or slower time acquisition. Our method can be generalized to treat a range of μ f 's and σ f 's, although in this work, we assume these are fixed to some determinable value. In this section, we compare our approach to existing methods.</p><p>The first approach is based on hidden Markov models (HMMs; <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Messina et al., 2006)</ref>. These methods are generally very reliable and have been used to great effect in other problems; however, for photobleaching event counting, HMMs are hampered because their computational cost quickly becomes prohibitive unless one limits the number of fluorescence intensity states that can be considered. For example, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Messina et al. (2006)</ref>, working on multichromophore photobleaching, to make the model computationally tractable, it was necessary to postulate that only single-level jumps occur, thus eliminating the possibility to treat overlapping events; even so, the method is limited to counting 30-40 fluorophores.</p><p>Another common approach relies on using some test or criterion to determine the number and location of photobleaching when, where, and how much drug release occurs inside the targeted cell. Recently ensemble fluorescence microscopy-based techniques have begun to be used to simultaneously answer these questions in a semiquantitative manner. Although these experiments sufficiently guide scientists to determine when large release events occur from endosomal compartments, they are insufficient to analyze slow-release events, low DDS concentrations, and events that occur outside of the endocytotic transport pathway (e.g., directly into the cytoplasm). By contrast, photobleaching event counting holds the promise to quantify release of DDS cargo more accurately <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Pitchiaya et al., 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Pitchiaya et al., , 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Pitchiaya et al., , 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Shankar et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>FIGURE 8: Our analysis of a trace obtained on GFP-tagged MCAK protein. These data are expected to show a large reactivation event and two or three steps, as the GFP-tagged proteins that have attached to a microtubule are first activated and then detach from the microtubule. Our method identifies the initial triple activation (a large initial activation event is expected when the fluorophores are first illuminated) and then finds two more steps (one double and one single). Given the small number of fluorophores and the low noise level, our findings are consistent with steps identifiable by eye.</p><p>FIGURE 9: Our analysis of a trace obtained on Alexa Fluor 555-tagged RAD51 proteins. In keeping with our expectation for how noise should change as more fluorophores are active, we identify two steps and determine that the small rise at the very start of the trace arises from noise, contrary to the analysis in van <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Mameren et al. (2009)</ref>. At low noise, our findings are again consistent with steps identifiable by eye. method performs better than the fixed-noise model because it avoids the excessive overfitting exhibited by the fixed-noise model at the high-noise, high-fluorophore start of the trace. We also outperform the Tdetector2 algorithm because 1) it does not explicitly consider blinking and overlapping events, and 2) it overestimates the number of active fluorophores, a problem that we also encountered but resolved through our prior, which is discussed in more detail in the Appendix. We also note that the data set we used to test our algorithm against the Tdetector2 algorithm purposefully violates our desideratum of minimally having 50 data points between successive steps. Nevertheless, our algorithm still outperforms the alternatives; see legends to <ref type="figure">Figures 13 and 14</ref> for details. As a final note, we stress that our algorithm does not involve smoothing or filtering, which removes information on fast-time scale kinetics.</p><p>Finally, there are many miscellaneous methods, from simple ones such as measuring the fluorescence "step" size from the late trace where steps can be detected by eye and using it to determine the number of fluorophores initially active, to more elaborate ones, such as using a Γ-distribution and dividing starting intensity by the result <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Coffman and Wu, 2012)</ref>, to using a binomial distribution with many traces to determine the most probable maximum fluorophore number <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Das et al., 2007)</ref>, to using the propagation of information with feedback algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(McGuire et al., 2012)</ref>. Such methods have faced problems when dealing with a large number (20-30) of fluorophores and low SNR.</p><p>A recent method, spot number intensity correlation (SONIC; <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Liesche et al., 2015)</ref>, is an innovative method that determines the total number of fluorophore-tagged subunits based on a statistical analysis of measurements of the time to total bleaching of all fluorophores in a complex. Because complexes with more fluorophoretagged subunits take longer to decay to background fluorescence, the statistical analysis can yield an estimate for the total fluorophore number without determining exact step locations. SONIC seems to be very accurate when determining the number of fluorophores, but it has a major drawback, in that it cannot locate photobleaching steps in time and therefore cannot address problems for which kinetic measurements are needed, such as when MCAK proteins move in and out of the spindle assembly during mitosis. steps. Such methods include the KV algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Kalafut and Visscher, 2008)</ref>, which assumes fixed noise and is captured by Eq. 8 and Student's two-sample t test <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Chen et al., 2014)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Chen et al. (2014)</ref> tested four different algorithms-two based on the SIC (with constant and variable variance) and two based on the two-sample t-tests-and concluded that the second of the twosample t-test-based algorithms (called Tdetector2) was the best for photobleaching event counting. We compared our method to both the fixed-noise model, Eq. 8, and the Tdetector2 algorithm ( <ref type="figure">Figures  13 and 14)</ref>. We tabulate the comparison results in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2</ref>. Our FIGURE 10: Our analysis of a trace obtained from HeLa cells transfected with Alexa Fluor 647-tagged microRNA-7. Our method locates seven steps in this data set, including two steps ascribed to blinking-on/off events. By contrast, the original analysis method found only three steps. The difference may be due to the fact that the original analysis method used filtering and averaging, which smooths out features of short duration, such as blinking.</p><p>FIGURE 11: Our analysis of a trace obtained from HeLa cells transfected with Alexa Fluor 647-tagged microRNA-7 with drift. Our method marks four steps in this data set, in agreement with the original analysis method, despite the fact that early in the data set, the intervals between steps have &lt;20 data points, making our method susceptible to error due to small-number statistics. Also note that this trace exhibits a slow, gradual decline in fluorescence that we believe is due to background autofluorescent endogenous material <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Monici, 2005)</ref> colocalized with our fluorescent microRNA. These background particles typically photobleach slowly and show very small step sizes, leading to the visualization of a slow, steady decrease in fluorescent signal and making step detection difficult by eye. Our algorithm, which relies on specific anticipated noise changes for photobleaching event, does not misinterpret drift as photobleaching events, as can be seen toward the end of the time trace. In principle, however, in order to become more robust to drift, our likelihood function would need to incorporate those effects.</p><p>FIGURE 12: Long time trace also obtained from HeLa cells transfected with Alexa Fluor 647-tagged microRNA-7. Our method marks ∼30 steps in this data set. The original analysis method found this data set intractable even after filtering. Our method finds not only many steps but also multiple blinking and overlapping events. Photobleaching events that are very close in time register as overlapping events if the data acquisition rate is longer than the interval between successive photobleachings.</p><p>data sets involving 50+ fluorophores, <ref type="figure">(Figure 7)</ref>, as suggested by our analysis of data set IV provided in <ref type="figure">Figure 12</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preparation of fluorescent microRNA duplexes</head><p>MicroRNA-7 (miR-7) guide and passenger oligonucleotides were synthesized with a 5′ phosphate and, in the case of the labeled guide strand, a 3′ NHS-ester-linked Alexa Fluor 647 (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA). Guide and passenger strands were HPLC purified by Integrated DNA Technologies, and their size and purity were verified by denaturing, 8 M urea, 20% PAGE. For the guide strand, 90% of the RNA was found to be singly labeled, as determined by quantifying the molar ratio of fluorophore to RNA through ultraviolet-visible absorbance measurements. Guide and passenger strands were heat annealed at a 1:1.5 ratio in 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 70011; Life Technologies, Delhi, India) to a final concentration of 10 μM. The extent of duplex formation was assessed using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay on a nondenaturing 20% polyacrylamide gel. The miR-7 passenger and guide strand sequences were as follows: miR-7 guide: 5′-p-UGGAAGACUAGUGAUUUUGUUGU-3′, miR-7 passenger: 5′-p-CAACAAAUCACAGUCUGCCAUA-3′.</p></div>

On reaching ∼80% confluency, cells were split and seeded onto DeltaT (Bioptechs, Butler, PA) dishes to a density of 1 × 10 5 cells/ dish. After 24 h, each dish of cells had half of its medium removed and was supplemented with 500 μl of transfection mixture <ref type="bibr">(Lipofectamine 2000 [11668019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA]</ref> and 40 pmol of miR-7 duplex in OptiMEM [31985070; Invitrogen]). To prevent overloading the cell with excessive fluorescently labeled miR-7, only 1% of the total duplexed guide strand contained Alexa Fluor 647. After a 4-h incubation period, the transfection mixture was replaced with fresh medium. At 6 h after transfection, the cells were washed thrice with 1× PBS, followed by a 20-min incubation with a 4% (wt/vol) paraformaldehyde and 1× PBS mixture for fixation. The cells were then washed thrice with 1× PBS, immersed in oxygen scavenger system (OSS; 5 mM protocatechuic acid, protocatechuate-3,4-dioxygenase, and 2 mM Trolox [6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchroman-2-carboxylic acid]), covered, and sealed using Valap sealant.</p></div>

Spatial resolution in itself is important because it may distinguish, for instance, between true colocalization of protein species and random spatial patterning below the diffraction limit <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Xia et al., 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Despite its advantages, counting from superresolution data may become computationally expensive <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Rollins et al., 2015)</ref> except when realized via very sparse activations-but in that case, the experiments are difficult-and may be complicated by photophysical artifacts such as incomplete maturation of the fluorophore <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Durisic et al., 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Although photobleaching event counting does not provide subdiffraction-limited information, it is computationally inexpensive and, for this reason, more complicated effects (such as blinking) can more feasibly be incorporated into the analysis of larger data sets. Here we argue that the key to successfully analyzing large photobleach data sets is to use the expected physics of the fluorophores to inform the step-finding process. This strategy reduces the number of errors arising from stochastically varying noise, blinking, and event overlap that arise in the methods to which we have compared ours.</p><p>For simple cases with few (&lt;20) fluorophores or high aSNR (&gt;1), our method does better than or just as well as coarser algorithms that ignore variance changes or blinking and overlap. However, our method does remarkably better on more challenging synthetic data sets and, presumably, would perform equally well in experimental FIGURE 13: Our method greatly improves on the results of methods that treat noise as fixed. To compare the performance of Eq. 8 to Eq. 11, we use a 20,000-data point set of just 10 fluorophores (μ f = 2.0 and σ f = 0.2) photobleaching to background with aSNR = 10.0-1.0. We show the theoretical signal (thick black line) around which we added noise (light blue), our estimate (yellow line), and the result of Eq. 8 (red line). At the end of the trace, both methods do very well. However, at the start of the trace, where cumulative noise is highest, our method has only minor offset (OF = 2.4), whereas a fixed-noise model grossly overfits, finding &gt;100 spurious steps. This is expected because the higher noise at the start of the trace is now interpreted as signal by algorithms that assume that noise is fixed. Note that both methods find all true steps (SE = 1 for both), but the overfit by the fixed-noise model leads to great disparity for precision (PR = 1 for our approach; PR ≈ 0.125 for Eq. 8). Inset, detail of the trace's first 1000 data points, where the bulk of overfitting by the fixed-noise model occurs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Trace extraction</head><p>Original trace analysis (done and then compared with the method described here) was performed using a custom-written Lab-View (National Instruments, Austin, TX) software code similar to previously described procedures <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Pitchiaya et al., 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Pitchiaya et al., , 2013</ref>. In short, the LabView code uses noise-filtering and photon-counting histogram algorithms to identify particles of interest and removes nonuniform background from all selected traces. The data were filtered further by a nonlinear Chung-Kennedy noise filter to preserve fast and sudden signal transitions while averaging out random noise. The filtered data were then assessed by eye, with each sudden decrease in signal classified as a photobleaching event. For each trace, the number of photobleaching events corresponds to the total fluorescent miR-7 molecules within a focus since &gt;90% of dye molecules are found to be fluorescent <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Pitchiaya et al., 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Pitchiaya et al., , 2013</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data analysis: fixed-cell photobleaching analysis of transfected fluorescent miR-7 duplex</head><p>To test the photobleaching event counting method described here in a biological context, we conducted a single-molecule photobleaching analysis to test the oligomerization state of transfected fluorescent miR-7 duplex in fixed HeLa cells. Six hours after transfection, our cells were fixed in a 4% paraformaldehyde solution, immersed in OSS, and illuminated using HILO fluorescence microscopy. Videos of single cells were acquired until all cellular fluorescent particles were photobleached into a permanent dark state. The original analysis was performed as described; via our custom LabView software, fluorescent particles were identified and background subtracted. Then noise was filtered to help identify by eye intensity transitions relevant to the photobleaching process. The results of this original analysis method were then compared with the results we acquired by first using the Lab View code just to select areas of interest and then processing the traces with our full Bayesian code.</p><p>Appendix: explicit form of the priors over m, K, and arr and the prior we use to constrain m to K Here we derive the explicit terms that go into the prior that informed our marginal posterior, Eq. 11, by detailing the form of the terms given in Eq. 4: P(arr|m, K), P(K), P(γ), and P(m|K, γ).</p></div>

When determining how m events are distributed in a set number of K steps, we have, from the number of combinations of m with repetition on K sites, the following total number of arrangements:</p><p>(Physik Instrumente, Karlsruhe, Germany), iXon 897 (Andor, Belfast, United Kingdom) electron-multiplying charge-coupled device camera, and a Cell-TIRF module (Olympus). Cells were illuminated using solid-state lasers with wavelengths of 405 nm (0.8 mW at the objective) and 640 nm (8 mW at the objective). Highly inclined laminar optical sheet (HILO) microscopy was used to achieve sufficient illumination depth while minimizing background. A quadband dichroic (Chroma) 405/488/532/647 was used to detect miR-7 fluorescent particles and cell boundaries. All videos were acquired at a 100-ms camera exposure time for 400 or 600 frames. FIGURE 14: Our algorithm offers an improvement over a recent Tdetector2 algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Chen et al., 2014)</ref>. In this 10,000-data point data set, 50 fluorophores photobleach to background with μ f = 2.0, σ f = 0.2, μ b = 20.0, and σ b = 0.0001. As before, we show the theoretical signal (thick black line) around which we added noise (light blue), the results of the Tdetector2 algorithm (red), and results of our approach (dark blue). The dark blue and red curves are displaced by ±15 fluorescence units, respectively, to facilitate comparison. Both algorithms do very well late in the trace, when noise is relatively low; however, as noise increases, both encounter problems. In particular, both algorithms underfit. For our method, such underfitting is expected due to small-number statistics (see later discussion). However, the Tdetector2 algorithm performs considerably worse. Inset, detail of the first 1000 data points of the trace. Underfitting for both algorithms is obvious, as is the fact that the Tdetector2 algorithm performs significantly worse than ours. We have aSNR = 10-0.1, PR B = 0.92, PR T = 0.81, SE B = 0.34, SE T = 0.31, OF B = 22.0, and OF T = 39.1, where the subscripts B and T denote our Bayesian method and the Tdetector2 algorithm results, respectively. Note that this particular synthetic data set was purposefully constructed to be "hard" for our algorithm to process: there are numerous cases in which neighboring fluorescence change events are separated by &lt;50 data points. For aSNR ≤ 0.25, 50 points is the minimum number of data points between steps that permits our algorithm to perform relatively reliably. If the number of data points between steps is smaller, small-number statistics introduces error into our algorithm.   where we set P(γ ), P <ref type="bibr">(s|arr, K, m)</ref>, and, implicitly, P(λ) to constants that we dropped.</p></div>
