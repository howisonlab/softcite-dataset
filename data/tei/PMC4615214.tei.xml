<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>P rotein-coding and non-coding RNA transcripts perform a wide variety of cellular functions in diverse organisms. Several of their functional roles are expressed and modulated via RNA structure. A given transcript, however, can have more than a single functional RNA structure throughout its life, a fact which has been previously overlooked. Transient RNA structures, for example, are only present during specific time intervals and cellular conditions. We here introduce four RNA families with transient RNA structures that play distinct and diverse functional roles. Moreover, we show that these transient RNA structures are structurally well-defined and evolutionarily conserved. Since RFAM annotates one structure for each family, there is either no annotation for these transient structures or no such family. Thus, our alignments either significantly update and extend the existing RFAM families or introduce a new RNA family to RFAM. For each of the four RNA families, we compile a multiplesequence alignment based on experimentally verified transient and dominant (dominant in terms of either the thermodynamic stability and/or attention received so far) RNA secondary structures using a combination of automated search via covariance model and manual curation. The first alignment is the Trp operon leader which regulates the operon transcription in response to tryptophan abundance through alternative structures. The second alignment is the HDV ribozyme which we extend to the 5 0 flanking sequence. This flanking sequence is involved in the regulation of the transcript's self-cleavage activity. The third alignment is the 5 0 UTR of the maturation protein from Levivirus</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Living organisms either have genomes that express RNA sequences as their primary products or genomes made of RNA. Understanding how RNA molecules convey a multitude of functional roles is thus key to understanding life. RNA molecules have the remarkable ability to form RNA structures which is one key mechanism for assigning a functional role to an RNA. These RNA structures and the functional roles they play, for example in regulating the transcription and translation of eukaryotic genes, have been the subject of intense study for several decades. Databases such as RFAM <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">1</ref> provide a catalogue of RNA families and the corresponding key RNA secondary-structure features across a range of evolutionarily related organisms. This has, for example, helped to automatically search newly sequenced genomes for members of known RNA families.</p><p>The need to go beyond the onesequence-one-structure dogma</p><p>As the sequencing of entire transcriptomes continues using increasingly powerful high-throughput sequencing techniques, it transpires that the transcriptomes of many organisms, including the human, are much more complex than initially thought. Several studies have discovered RNA molecules with multiple structures which each plays a distinct functional role at different times of the molecule's life. One early example of sequences with more than one functional RNA structure is so-called riboswitch <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4]</ref> which consists of two distinct, mutually exclusive RNA structures each with a distinct functional role. We thus need to start looking beyond the one-sequence-onestructure dogma to appreciate that one RNA sequence can have more than one functional structure throughout its cellular life and to understand the mechanisms underlying their regulation.</p><p>We know by now that RNA structure formation in vivo involves transient RNA structure elements which can not only help to define co-transcriptional folding pathways, but can also play distinct functional roles of their own. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">5</ref> These transient structures can, for example, aid the correct formation of long range interaction (LRI), as seen in Bacterial RNase P Type A RNA and Bacterial SRP 4.5S RNA where the transient structures are formed preceding a transcriptional pausing site to sequester the 5' portion of a LRI until the cognate 3' portion is synthesised. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">6</ref> Moreover, such transient structures can be employed to regulate gene expression either via translational control as exemplified in Levivirus <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">8</ref> or via a transcriptional mechanism as exhibited by Tryptophan operon leader <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">10</ref> and SAM riboswitch. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">11</ref> Last but not the least, transient structures incorporating the 5' flanking sequence are involved in adjusting the self-cleavage activity of HDV ribozyme, CPEB3 ribozyme and group I intron. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">13</ref> Recent statistical evidence suggests that some transient structures are evolutionarily conserved across homologous sequences thus confirming their potential functional importance. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">14</ref> It is thus possible to provide entries in RFAM with a more complete structural annotation which should in turn allow us to gain a better understanding of the underlying regulatory mechanisms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Purpose</head><p>For each of the four alignments introduced in this study, evidence from previous studies (as cited in each individual section below) shows that the formation of the experimentally confirmed transient/ alternative structures is critical to confer to the RNA molecule the ability to modulate gene expression or regulate ribozyme activity. Moreover, our previous research <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">14</ref> shows that the computationally predicted co-transcriptional folding pathways for homologous RNA sequences go through similar transient structural configurations, thus supporting our hypothesis that evolutionarily related RNA sequences co-transcriptionally fold in similar ways whose features have been partly conserved. Overall, the functional and structural annotation of any RNA family should thus naturally include any conserved transient and alternative strutures with functional roles. Right now, however, RFAM 1 only specifies a single functional structure for each RNA family. The RFAM database of RNA families 1 features three of them -Trp operon leader (RF00513), HDV ribozyme (RF00094), SAM riboswitch (RF00162) -but lacks the annotation and alignment for the alternative structures. More specifically, RFAM features the terminator structure of Trp operon leader, but misses the anti-terminator structure; for HDV ribozyme, the active self-cleavage structure is included, but the repressive and permissive structures involving the 5' flanking sequence of the cleavage site are missing; for the SAM riboswitch, though most of the SAM-bound structure is included, the corresponding alignment and annotation for the terminator hairpin and the SAM-unbound structure are absent. The Levivirus family is completely new and not yet part of RFAM. In order to provide more complete structural annotations including conserved transient and alternative structures, we set up a pipeline involving INFERNAL program <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">92</ref> to structurally align sequences for multiple structures. We here show that it is possible to go beyond the one-sequence-one-structure dogma by providing carefully curated alignment annotated by both transient/ alternative and dominant structures for the four RNA alignments (section 1 of Supplementary Material contains the alignments, CM files and initial structures/sequence identified from literature).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transcriptional control of the tryptophan operon</head><p>Layout of the functional domains in trp operon</p><p>The E.coli trp operon spans approximately 7000 nucleotides (nt) which consecutively encode the promoter containing an operator, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">16</ref> the transcribed leader region, and structural genes essential for the biosynthesis of tryptophan(trp), i.e. E, D, C, B, A. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">17</ref> The leader transcript refers to the 162 nt long untranslated region (UTR) preceding the structural genes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">10</ref> Along this leader transcript, the ribosomal binding site resides at the 5' end, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">18</ref> and an internal transcription termination signal is located distally before the first structural gene E. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">19</ref> This termination signal, lying within the attenuator, can be recognised by RNA polymerase to produce a transcript of about 140 nt (137-141) length. <ref type="bibr">9.20</ref> This shorter transcript generates a leader peptide consisting of 14 residues whose distal end has a tandem of trp residues. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">10</ref> This leader peptide is involved in the attenuation regulatory strategy where the Trp operon leader is utilised for adaptation to the metabolic condition concerning the biosynthesis of trp. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9</ref> Attenuation in Tryptophan operon leader The trp-activated repressor protein (trpR) is stimulated upon trp binding to compete against RNA polymerase, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21</ref> and consequently switches off the initiation of trp operon transcription. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22</ref> An additional repression mechanism is postulated to operate directly on the progressing transcription along the starting segment of the operon. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">24</ref> Further deletion mutagenesis studies narrow down the regulatory region onto the leader region of the trp operon <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">26</ref> wherein transcription stops at a distal transcription termination site. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">27</ref> The transcription and translation of this short leader transcript have been demonstrated in vivo and in vitro. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">29</ref> The corresponding leader peptide is the byproduct of the attenuation mechanism which is essentially an internal transcription termination signal that is modulated in response to the abundance of metabolites relevant to the products of this operon. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">25</ref> Consequently, the ongoing transcription of the downstream operon genes could be regulated accordingly and promptly in an "economical" way. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">25</ref> The attenuation mechanism requires the translation of the leader peptide as shown by the altered termination frequency observed in mutants with deficient components or targets of the translation machinery, e.g., tRNA, tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase and start codon. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">31</ref> Whether the ribosome stalls during translation and where this occurs is likely to influence this regulatory attenuation mechanism because it depends on the abundance of the corresponding loaded tRNA; given the trailing trp tandem observed in this trp operon, the trp codon is found to be the codon responsible for this. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32</ref> Where the ribosome stalls dictates which alternative RNA structure the leader transcript forms: either the transcription termination hairpin forms or it is disrupted to permit transcriptional read-through. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">30</ref> In essence, the choice between terminator and anti-terminator structures bridges the communication between the translation of the leader peptide and the transcription of operon genes in exchanging the message for the abundance of trp. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">33</ref> Dual regulatory systems for the operon expression</p><p>When trp is abundant, the cell uses a repressive system to promote the synthesis of other amino acids in starvation; here, the trpR repressor operates on the transcription initiation whereas the attenuation operates on the progressing transcription. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">10</ref> The repression system targets the intracellular trp concentration which depends on the influx trp, the newly synthesised trp, and finally the consumption of trp for protein synthesis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">10</ref> In contrast, the attenuation measures the concentration of charged tRNA Trp , which is contributed by cellular capability of protein synthesis, trp concentration, tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase, and tRNA Trp . <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">10</ref> The intracellular trp concentration does not always correlate with the concentration of charged tRNA Trp . <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9</ref> This dual system thus acts in concert to tune the biosynthesis level of trp on a wide spectrum. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">34</ref> Terminator Structure The terminator structure consists of two hairpins</p><p>The 5' portion of the first hairpin encompasses the region encoding the trailing residues of the leader peptide: Trp, Trp, Arg, Thr, Ser 10 ( <ref type="figure">Figure 1)</ref>. Other than the trp tandem required for sensing trp deficiency, base pairs embedded in this region also impose constraints on the sequence composition; indeed, <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. Schematic drawing for Tryptophan operon leader. The Trp codon (W) tandem is highlighted in green color in both the gene structure (the leader peptide sequence is shown) and the RNA secondary structures. The stem of the termination hairpin is colored in red in both terminator and anti-terminator structures. In the anti-terminator structure, the ribosome, stalling on the Trp tandem, impedes the formation of the first hairpin. The 5' portion (red) of the termination hairpin is then sequestered in an anti-terminator hairpin. The RNA secondary structures in <ref type="figure">Figures 1-4</ref> are drawn via VARNA <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">[98]</ref>.</p><p>conservation is observed in these five successive codons and mutating the upstream codons does not alter the operon expression. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[36]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37]</ref> The second hairpin, enriched in G/C and immediately followed by several uracil residues, comprises the termination signal that attenuates the operon transcription. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20</ref> The terminator structure forms when no ribosome stalls in the vicinity of the Trp tandem (i.e., Trp or Arg codon); that is, either the leader peptide is not translated or the translation proceeds smoothly along the 5 0 portion of the first hairpin with abundant charged tRNA Trp . <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">10</ref> More specifically, the ribosome is proposed to sterically mask about 10 nts downstream, thus ribosome stalling in either the upstream Gly or further downstream Thr does not disrupt the formation of the termination hairpin. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">10</ref> Thereafter, co-transcriptional folding only allows the two hairpins to form sequentially; the first hairpin forms right after its pairing portions are transcribed, rendering the 3 0 portion of the first hairpin unavailable to pair with the newly synthesised 5 0 half of the second termination hairpin. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">10</ref> Experimental evidence. In the past, the terminator structure responsible for producing the 140 nt-long attenuated leader transcript has been investigated via experimental approaches. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Lee and Yanofsky (1977)</ref> concluded that the termination efficiency at the attenuator is correlated with the stability of an embedded secondary structure which is conserved between E. coli and Salmonnella typhimurium; the proposed structures agree with results of a partial RNase T1 digestion that exhibit digestion resistance in the distal portion of this transcript, i.e., where the structural features are located. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32</ref> Thereafter, Oxender et al. (1979) conducted structural probing with RNase T1 partial digestion followed by isolation of the comigrating pairing regions in a non-denaturing gel electrophoresis; the base-pairing regions were subsequently identified via denaturing gel electrophoresis and fingerprinting, based on which the two hairpins comprising the terminator structure were drawn. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">33</ref> Later on, the secondary structure of DNA template was ruled out as a contributor for this termination signal so the RNA structural features are the one causing the termination. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">39</ref> Indeed, the functional importance of the second hairpin for the transcriptional termination is illustrated by the reduced transcription termination frequency observed in experiments destabilising the central GCC pairing of this hairpin, such as by in vivo mutational analysis or in vitro substitution of G-C bond by I-C bond. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[40]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[41]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[42]</ref> Moreover, mutational analysis progressively disrupting the first hairpin still preserves the production of the attenuated transcript, suggesting that the second hairpin itself is sufficient for the termination. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">42</ref> Anti-terminator structure Anti-terminator structure disrupts the two terminator hairpins</p><p>The anti-terminator hairpin is formed by the pairing between the 3 0 portion of the first hairpin and the 5 0 portion of the second hairpin from the terminator structure. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">10</ref> This structure occurs when charged tRNA Trp (or tRNA Arg ) is starving, and the ribosome is impeded around the tandem Trp codon where the 5 0 portion of the first terminator hairpin resides. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">10</ref> This stalling ribosome spans approximately 10 nucleotides downstream and thereby prevents the formation of the first terminator hairpin. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">10</ref> Instead, it promotes the base-pairing between the 3 0 half of the first terminator hairpin and the 5 0 half of the second terminator hairpin once they are transcribed. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">10</ref> Co-transcriptionally, this removes the pairing option held by the 3 0 of the second terminator hairpin, rendering it single-stranded. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">10</ref> Since the transcriptional termination hairpin is sequestered under this circumstance, the progressing RNA polymerase no longer dissociates at the attenuation site, and the mRNA encoding the trp operon poly-peptides gets fully transcribed. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">10</ref> Nonetheless, the anti-terminator hairpin is speculated to still form occasionally after the ribosome dissociates from the leader transcript even in the absence of ribosome stalling. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9</ref> Experimental evidence Both the translation of the leader peptide and ribosomal stalling are necessary for inhibiting the transcription termination. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">31</ref> Moreover, mutational analysis destabilising or disrupting the base-pairing of the anti-terminator hairpin, e.g., trpL75 mutant, demonstrates increased termination of several folds; consistent with the attenuation model, this mutation prevents the relief of attenuation even with Trp starvation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">31</ref> In contrast, complementary oligonucleotides targeting the 5 0 portion of the first terminator hairpin increase the operon expression, presumably promoting the antiterminator formation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">43</ref> However, there is no direct experimental evidence confirming the base-pairing of the anti-terminator hairpin (i.e., structural probing) due to the co-transcriptional nature, i.e. the other two terminator hairpins render the anti-terminator formation infeasible. 9</p><p>Half-life of the structures The formation of the alternative structures is determined by whether or not the translating ribosome is impeded, which must be concomitantly captured by the transcribing polymerase. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9</ref> The time scale of the structural modulation must thus be comparable to that of the transcribing polymerase. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">10</ref> Evidence supporting this requirement is a transcriptional pausing site located at the end of the first terminator hairpin which allows time to put the ribosome in sync with the RNA polymerase along the same transcript. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">10</ref> The amount of trp abundance can thus be measured in a timely manner via the proper formation of the alternative structure.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Alignments</head><p>We summarize the key features of our alignments in <ref type="table">Tables 1 and 2</ref>. A small multiple sequence alignment (MSA) from a previous project published by us <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">14</ref> was used to build a primary covariance model (CM) using the INFERNAL program <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">92</ref> to search the full alignments in RFAM 1 and the NCBI TAXONOMY BROWSER. <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">93</ref> In our previous research, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">14</ref> these small MSA were compiled using evolutionarily related sequences for these four RNA families, respectively. These small MSAs are of a high-quality with positive covariation and few gaps, making them convenient starting points to build the corresponding primary CMs. For each of our four alignments, we aligned the sequences of the seed alignment in RFAM with the primary CM first and then curated this against all experimentally verified structures which were first mapped to a reference sequence. We then build a secondary CM incorporating sequences from the RFAM seed alignment which we used to align the hits returned by the search <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>. Arc-plot for the HDV ribozyme. The alignment and arcs at the top show the permissive alternative structure 2 and the active structure. The alternative structure 2, P(-1), is the 13-bp hairpin on the left side on top of the arc diagram. The bottom arcs correspond to the inhibitory alternative structure 1.

These hits were clustered to reduce primary sequence redundancy, choosing a representative sequence for each cluster based on structural fit and covariation. Hits passing this selection strategy were retained only if they contained all alternative structures. We then calculated quality measures for the resulting hits to determine which ones to add to the existing small MSA. The resulting alignment was then curated recursively according to the aligning results returned by INFERNAL using the secondary CM for each of the alternative structures.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mapping structures</head><p>Each of the alternative structures is mapped to the curated alignments via the respective reference sequence, see <ref type="table">Tables 1  and 2</ref> for the structure-specific quality measures. All quality measures for all new alignments show an improvement with respect to the corresponding RFAM alignments, if they exist, see <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. As the numbers in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> show, the evolutionary evidence supporting the alternative structures is strong and comparable to those supporting the nominal structural features, see <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. This is also illustrated in the arc-plots shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figures 5-8</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>We introduce four RNA families, the Trp operon leader, the Levivirus 5 0 UTR, the HDV ribozyme, and the Sam riboswitch, with transient structures that convey important functions critical to the regulation of their gene expression. The functional roles of these transient structures are diverse and comprise transcription regulation (Trp operon and SAM riboswitch), self-cleavage (HDV ribozyme) and translation regulation (Levivirus 5 0 UTR). Moreover, we show for all four alignments that both the dominant and transient structures are evolutionarily conserved. Our four alignments and structural annotations either significantly update and extend the existing RFAM family or introduce a new RNA family.</p><p>Overall, we hope to make that the case that the structural annotation of any RNA family ought to naturally also comprise functional transient RNA structures. This will not only require further experimental research regarding their structure determination and the study of their functional roles, but also some adjustments in RFAM. It should be fairly easy to provide a dedicated structural annotation for each functional role for a given RNA family. It will be more difficult to extend seed alignments in RFAM into full alignments using the current computational analysis pipeline of RFAM as more than one covariance model may be required to capture both the dominant and transient RNA structures of a given RNA family. Finally, translating experimental evidence into a structural annotation of an RNA family, as shown here for four families, is not always a straightforward task for transient structures and may require more manual curation and expertise. Ribonuclease probing, for example, of regions embedded in alternative structures may display only minor hits, rendering the interpretation ambiguous. <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">72</ref> A concerted effort using a variety of experimental techniques as well as more sophisticated computational analysis tools will thus be required to arrive at complete structural annotations that also comprise functional transient structures.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials and Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Primary covariation model: Initial Small Alignment</head><p>A primary covariation model (cm) is constructed using a small good-quality alignment assembled previously by our group; 14 repeat the CM compilation (i.e., build and calibrate in INFERNAL-1.1RC2) for each of the alternative structures. If the structure contains pseudo-knots, it must be split into non-pseudo-knotted substructures in order to process it in INFER-NAL; if possible, compatible helices of such non-pseudo-knotted substructures and the remaining alternative structures are combined into one structure so as to simplify the subsequent curation (e.g., in HDV, a non-pseudo-knotted substructure of the active conformation is added to the alt2 structure). The aforementioned preassembled alignments of Trp operon leader, Levivirus, HDV and SAM riboswitch have 10, 7, 10 and 15 sequences, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Secondary covariation model: preassembled alignment + unique RFAM seed alignment sequences</head><p>Firstly, the primary CM is used to align the sequences from the RFAM seed alignment (or only part of it, e.g., the alternative structures of HDV are only valid for the genomic sequences, so only genomic sequences are aligned here). This aligning procedure is repeated for the primary CM built from each of the alternative structures. Secondly, redundant sequences are removed from this expanded alignment (i.e., sequence from pre-assembled alignment + RFAM seed alignment), which is subsequently manually curated to optimise the covariation for all alternative structures. Curation is initiated on the alignment generated by the CM with the structure with the largest number of base pairs, and the other alternative structural features are mapped onto the same alignment. During curation, RALEE <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">94</ref> is used to visually compare the resultant alignments generated by the covariation models pertaining to each alternative structure, and structural overlapping regions are identified and then manually curated (section 4.1 (iv) of Supplementary Material). Thirdly, a secondary CM is thus built and calibrated based on this expanded alignment.</p><p>Expanded Alignment: select sequences to add into the original small MSA</p><p>Overlapped hits Firstly, the primary CM for each alternative structure is used to search the RFAM full alignment via INFERNAL (alternatively, for Levivirus, NCBI TAXONOMY BROWSER is used by downloading the branch of the tree of life in which this non-coding RNA resides; for SAM riboswitch, we start our curation from an alignment provided by <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Winkler et al. (2003)</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">11</ref> and the SAMbound structure is also annotated by them). A sequence is retained only if the searches using the CM of each individual alternative structure all return this sequence as a hit, and if this sequence spans the full length of all the CM without truncated ends. A hit is defined as a candidate sequence that yields log-odds score greater than 0 in the search result. Secondly, the secondary CM is used to align the overlapped hits; repeat the aligning step for all secondary CM corresponding to each of the alternative structures. Since the alignment constructing the secondary CM is optimised for all alternative structures, aligning the hits using the secondary CM facilitates the following curation among all alternative structures.</p><p>The search for homologs to add is only conducted on the RFAM full alignment rather than searching the NCBI from scratch, which is due to the fact that the qualified sequence to add must satisfy the requirement for all alternative structures. Thus, it would be more efficient but without loss of generality to start from the candidates fitting well with at least one of the alternative structures, i.e., the RFAM full alignment.</p><p>Cluster the aligned overlapped hits In order to reduce the sequence redundancy and increase the diversity, the alignment sequences comprised of the overlapped hits are clustered based on primary sequence conservation via USEARCH; <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">95</ref> different percentage identity cutoffs are tested to obtain around 50 to 100 clusters. For each alternative structure, a best-fit sequence is chosen for each cluster using home-made scripts scoring the covariation. Best-fit sequences overlapped among all of the structures are identified as common hits. These common hits are then ranked and filtered based on the fit of the sequence to a structure and the extent of insertions relative to the reference sequence, which gives rise to a MSA for each structure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Criteria for selecting sequences to add</head><p>The structural measures (e.g., covariation, gappiness) of these ranked common hit sequences in the alignment are then incrementally calculated starting from the top sequence for each alternative structure, respectively. Thus, a set of sequences could be chosen systematically to be added to the original small alignment to enhance the alignment quality. Sequences added should maintain the positive overall covariation score of this alignemnt, have few invalid base-pairs, the least number of insertions introducing gaps, and no significant redundancy in terms of primary sequence identity among them.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Curation</head><p>Visual inspection and manual comparison are finally conducted to improve the alignment quality in terms of structural fitting. Homologous regions must be aligned based on their primary sequence: they cannot be shuffled around merely to satisfy the reference structure if they are obvious to be homologous to a neighbouring region and not to the reference helix region. Ensure any region (including nonstructural) with known binding site, or other knowledge concerning the conservation in primary sequence is properly aligned. The detailed curation steps are described in section 4 of Supplementary Material.</p><p>Reference sequence and structure The calculation of covariation and structure mapping involved in the aforementioned work-flow use the following reference sequence: (1) Trp operon leader: AE005174.2/2263095-2263188, from E.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 3 .</head><label>3</label><figDesc>Schematic drawing for HDV ribozyme.
