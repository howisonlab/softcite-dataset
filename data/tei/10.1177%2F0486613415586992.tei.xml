				<p>The anticommons in knowledge is distinct from the anticommons in physical objects. The former is always tragic, the latter not necessarily so. For society at large, the tragedy of the anticommons is more serious when it involves knowledge than when it involves physical resources. Buchanan and Yoon&apos;s (2000) formal model of the anticommons is incorrect even within the neoclassical context, and their neoliberal suggestion that single ownership is the socially optimal solution to the tragedy of the knowledge anticommons is misleading. This article argues that the only, epistemically and socially beneficial solution to the tragedy of the knowledge anticommons is to create, expand, and protect the knowledge commons. The article also constructs a simple formal model based on Bessen and Maskin&apos;s (2006) sequential model, as a metaphor for how the comedy of the knowledge commons works. The analysis supports the worldwide movement for free knowledge, and dissents from the evolving political and academic consensus in China in favor of more restrictive intellectual property regimes.</p>

Meanwhile each fancies that no harm will come of his neglect, that it is the business of somebody else to look after this or that for him; and so, by the same notion being entertained by all separately, the common cause imperceptibly decays" <ref type="bibr">(Thucydides n.d.: book 1, chapter 5;</ref><ref type="bibr">Heller 2008: 208)</ref>. Aristotle, in his Politics, noted that "that which is common to the greatest number has the least care bestowed upon it.

In 1968, the ecologist Garrett James Hardin popularized concerns about the misuse of common property resources with a widely referenced article entitled "The Tragedy of the Commons" in the journal Science <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Hardin 1968;</ref><ref type="bibr">RSAS 2009)</ref>.</p><p>Dual to the concept "commons" 3 is the concept "anticommons." The idea was popularized in a 1998 article by Michael Heller published in the Harvard Law Review entitled "The Tragedy of the Anticommons: Property in the Transition from Marx to Markets." According to the article, Frank Michelman appeared to have coined the term "anticommons" by introducing the equivalent of an anticommons through his speculative definition of a "regulatory regime" in his 1982 article challenging the presumptive efficiency of private property, 4 where he defined a "regulatory regime" to be a type of property "in which everyone always has rights respecting the objects in the regime, and no one, consequently, is ever privileged to use any of them except as particularly authorized by the others." This definition is based upon a kind of logical duality: "[i]f a regime exists in which all are privileged to use whatever objects they wish and in which no one holds exclusionary rights (that is, a commons), then, as a matter of logic, an anticommons also could exist where no one is privileged to use objects and everyone has the right to exclude" <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Heller 1998)</ref>.</p><p>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Heller (1998)</ref> there are only a few hypothetical examples for which an anticommons under Michelman's definition, which precludes use of the property by anyone, is the most efficient property regime. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Heller (1998)</ref> finds that "for most resources that people care about, some level of use is preferable to non-use, and an anticommons regime is a threat to, rather than the epitome of, optimal use." He concludes that "[a]nticommons property is prone to the tragedy of underuse." It is Heller who coined the term "tragedy of the anticommons" <ref type="bibr">(Heller 2008: 18, 21)</ref>.</p><p>As a practical matter <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Epstein (2009)</ref> noted that the holdout problem, one of the potential outcomes in an anticommons, has long been a concern of public policy makers. <ref type="bibr">5</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Epstein (2009)</ref> also noted that "the ability to link this problem up with the issue of overconsumption of shared resources-or commons-opens up previously unappreciated avenues for research." <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Buchanan and Yoon (2000)</ref> tried to unite the concepts of a commons and anticommons mathematically. Some reviewers may have been attracted to the mathematical beauty in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Buchanan and Yoon's (2000)</ref> formal model, in which the anticommons and commons problems are shown to be <ref type="bibr">2</ref> As cited by <ref type="bibr">RSAS (2009)</ref>, the article is Jens Warming <ref type="bibr">(1911)</ref>.

They (2006) also noted that for the general term commons there is differentiation between a commons as a shared resource or resource system which is called common-pool resources and independent of particular property rights, and a commons as a property-rights regime which is called common property and is a legal regime, a jointly owned legal set of rights. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> As cited by <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Heller (1998</ref><ref type="bibr">), Michelman's 1982</ref><ref type="bibr">article is Frank I.

However, on the one hand, their formulation is incorrect even within the neoclassical context, because they mistook some basic concepts that are at least as old as what was considered by Jules Dupuit <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Coloma 2003)</ref>  <ref type="bibr">6</ref> ; on the other hand, even if it were correct within the neoclassical context, their formal model should be still ideological rather than universally true, as is the case with most other neoclassical economic models. For example, the model ignores several dimensions of intellectual property issues explored in heterodox economics. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> This article discusses the tragedy of the anticommons with respect to a special category, "knowledge," which is distinct from physical objects. While <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Heller and Eisenberg (1998)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Heller (2008: 76-78)</ref> warned that the privatization of biomedical research "risks creating a tragedy of the anticommons through a proliferation of fragmented and overlapping intellectual property rights," they did not generalize their criticism of intellectual property rights. Instead they claimed that the tragedy of underuse arising out of the biomedical anticommons "is distinct from the routine underuse inherent in any well-functioning patent system." This article challenges that delimitation, and argues that intellectual property per se is the very source of the tragedy of the anticommons in knowledge and that the tragedy is unavoidable so long as an intellectual property regime exists.</p><p>The rest of this article is organized as follows. The second section analyzes both the anticommons in knowledge, which is distinct from the anticommons in physical objects, and the tragedy of the anticommons in knowledge. This is followed by a third section that refutes the neoliberal argument that single ownership is the socially optimal solution to the tragedy of the knowledge anticommons. The fourth section argues that the only epistemically and socially beneficial solution to the tragedy of the knowledge anticommons is to create, expand, and protect the knowledge commons. In the fifth section, a simple model based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bessen and Maskin's (2006)</ref> sequential model is constructed as a metaphor for how the comedy of the knowledge commons works. The last section is the conclusion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">The Anticommons Tragedy in Knowledge</head><p>The concept of the anticommons can be traced back to at least as early as 1838. In that year Antoine Augustin Cournot published his Researches into the Mathematical Principles of the Theory of Wealth, which included his "complementary monopoly" theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Sonnenschein 1968;</ref><ref type="bibr">Heller 2008: 42)</ref>. Hugo Sonnenschein in a 1968 article demonstrated a formal duality between Cournot's theory of duopoly and his theory of complementary monopoly <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Sonnenschein 1968;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Feinberg and Kamien 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Gardner, Gaston, and Masson 2002)</ref>. Nirvikar Singh and Xavier Vives in a 1984 article provided a general treatment of the duality between Cournot competition and Bertrand competition, showing that oligopolists selling complementary products will choose to compete over price rather than output <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Singh and Vives 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Gardner, Gaston, and Masson 2002)</ref>. The methodology these and other researches provided has been adopted by some scholars for investigating the regime of anticommons and for economic modeling of the anticommons.</p><p>These formal economic models for analyzing anticommons and the tragedy of the anticommons in physical objects may also give clues about anticommons and the tragedy of the anticommons in knowledge. For example, the simultaneous anticommons problem illustrated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Coloma's (2003)</ref> model, which corrected and reformulated <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Buchanan and Yoon's (2000)</ref> formal model within the neoclassical context, may be also used as a metaphor for one of the two mechanisms by which an anticommons might be created in biomedical research-by creating too many concurrent fragments of intellectual property rights in potential future products (e.g. the existence of separate patents on complementary gene fragments) <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Heller and Eisenberg 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr">Landes and Posner 2003: 316)</ref>, and the sequential anticommons problem illustrated in the model in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Parisi, Schulz, and Depoorter (2004)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Schulz, Parisi, and Depoorter (2002)</ref> may be also used as a metaphor for the other mechanism-by permitting too many upstream patent owners to stack licenses on top of the future discoveries of downstream users <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Heller and Eisenberg 1998)</ref>.</p><p>Despite some insights, the existing formal economic models for analyzing the anticommons have limited explanatory power. They fail to address the full scope of anticommons problems in physical objects. Furthermore, the models are basically designed for explaining an anticommons in physical objects and therefore miss some of the distinctive problems related to an anticommons in knowledge.</p><p>First, the tragedy of the anticommons in knowledge is much more severe than in physical objects, because of the idiosyncratic nature of knowledge: the existence of substantial, widespread, and even ubiquitous positive knowledge externalities, which will be significantly inhibited by the regime of anticommons.</p><p>The essence of knowledge creation is a course of systematic, indivisible, continuous, and dynamic development. An intellectual property regime, however, tries to break up such a course into fragments of intellectual monopolies. In the words of Michael Polanyi, "[i]t tries to parcel up a stream of creative thought into a series of distinct claims, each of which is to constitute the basis of a separately owned monopoly," and tries to divide up "the growth of human knowledge. . .into such sharply circumscribed phases" <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Polanyi 1944;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Machlup 1958)</ref>. In that case, each owner, i.e. the monopolist of each fragment of "knowledge," has the right to exclude others from using that fragment, and thus no one will have the freedom to use the whole stream of that "knowledge." The anticommons in knowledge so created poses a dire threat to the growth of human knowledge. For example, as <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Heller and Eisenberg (1998)</ref> mentioned, "[p]rivatization of upstream biomedical research in the United States may create anticommons property that is less visible than empty storefronts but even more economically and socially costly." Second, when there are significant pervasive negative externalities of use of physical resources, an anticommons in physical objects may be a better regime for social welfare because of less use of the resources, whereas with an anticommons in knowledge that is not the case. The loss of positive externalities from an anticommons in knowledge creation is unlikely to be offset by reductions in the negative externalities accompanying knowledge creation.</p><p>As neoliberals always ignore or downplay externalities, <ref type="bibr">8</ref> Buchanan and Yoon (2000) did not consider externalities in their model for commons and anticommons. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Coloma (2003)</ref> corrected and improved <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Buchanan and Yoon's (2000)</ref> model within the neoclassical context, taking externalities into account for the problem of the commons by introducing a specific cost function. But his model only considered a so-called reciprocal externality, which is a localized negative externality. He did not consider negative externalities on environments outside the commons property, which are pervasive negative externalities. For the problem of the anticommons, his model considered neither the localized negative externalities nor the pervasive negative externalities. When negative externalities are pervasive and significant, as is often the case, less use of the resources as a result of the anticommons regime than the "efficient" quantity determined in either <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Buchanan and Yoon's (2000)</ref> or <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Coloma's (2003)</ref> model may be better for social welfare. In some circumstances, even no use of resources as a result of an anticommons regime under Michelman's definition 9 may be the best use. Two examples of the latter are Robert Ellickson's hypothetical wilderness preserve, which "'any person' has standing to enforce," and James Krier's hypothetical nuclear-waste dump, which is so dangerous that everyone "has standing to exclude" <ref type="bibr">(Heller 1998: 667, 668</ref>, note 214, note 215, and note 216).</p><p>For "knowledge," however, there are never any of the above-mentioned pervasive negative externalities. For an anticommons in physical objects, "less use" is not necessarily "underuse" and in some circumstances even no use may be the best use, which may be called "the comedy of the anticommons" <ref type="bibr">(Heller 2008: 46, 47)</ref>. For an anticommons in knowledge, "less use" is necessarily the "underuse," thus becoming tragic.</p><p>Finally, when pervasive negative externalities of use of physical resources are minor, possible coordination and cooperation between multiple owners (excluders) in an anticommons in physical objects may reduce the extent of underuse, but the underuse will not be eliminated; for an anticommons in knowledge, on the other hand, not only is there the underuse that such coordination and cooperation will not be able to eliminate, but much more importantly, such "cooperation" will inhibit the positive knowledge externalities to a greater extent.</p><p>Both <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Buchanan and Yoon's (2000)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Coloma's (2003)</ref> model only applied non-cooperative games in analyzing the commons and anticommons problems, without considering the cases of cooperative games. In reality, however, there exists the potential for coordination and cooperation between multiple owners (excluders) in an anticommons, "with success more likely within close-knit communities than among hostile strangers" <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Heller and Eisenberg 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Heller 1998</ref>: 625, and note 17). 10 When pervasive negative externalities are minor, such cooperation, if successful, will improve social welfare by reducing the extent of underuse. The result of the successful cooperation may be an equilibrium where these owners' (excluders') total surplus is maximized, the same as the equilibrium under the single ownership, where the single owner's total surplus is maximized, as shown by <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Buchanan and Yoon (2000)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Buchanan and Yoon's (2000)</ref> analysis suggested that the equilibrium under either the single ownership or efficient collective management is socially optimal, but the suggestion is incorrect even according to neoclassical standards. The equilibrium point, with less quantity supplied and higher price, actually deviates from the "true," socially optimal point, where the average revenue given by the demand function is equal to the social marginal cost, as shown in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Coloma's (2003)</ref> model, which corrected and reformulated <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Buchanan and Yoon's (2000)</ref> model within the neoclassical context. <ref type="bibr">11</ref> The deviation derives from the market power that the single owner has or the multiple owners <ref type="bibr">9</ref> Heller (1998) defined anticommons property as "a property regime in which multiple owners hold effective rights of exclusion in a scarce resource." The distinction between Michelman's and <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Heller's (1998)</ref> definition is important. The former can be understood as an open-access anticommons, which Robert C. Ellickson argued may be rare and for which a threshold requirement of "near simultaneous unanimous consent," which will be nearly impossible to achieve, ensures that the property will not be used by anyone <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Heller 1998)</ref>. The latter can be understood as a limited-access anticommons, in which a limited group of owners have rights of exclusion and which Ellickson argued appears more often (See Heller 1998: 667, 668, 669, and note 218). In the commons/anticommons duality, it is obvious that an open-access anticommons and a limited-access anticommons correspond to an open-access commons and a limited-access commons respectively. RSAS (2009), for example, mentioned the cases of "open access" and "a fixed number of users" for a commons. <ref type="bibr">10</ref> Obviously, an anticommons in a close-knit community is a limited-access anticommons. 11 <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Coloma (2003)</ref> pointed out that in fact the tragedy of the commons does not exist in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Buchanan and Yoon's (2000)</ref> model aimed at illustrating both the commons tragedy and the anticommons tragedy, because their model does not include any cost function. Instead, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Coloma's (2003)</ref> model introduces a cost function for each owner (user) such that each owner's (user's) private marginal cost is lower than the social marginal cost, which represents the reciprocal externality among the owners (users) that creates the tragedy of the commons.</p><p>(excluders) under the cooperation in the anticommons collectively have by virtue of monopolizing the physical resources. That is to say, when the pervasive negative externalities are modest, cooperation between the multiple owners (excluders) in the anticommons in physical objects, even if successful, will not eliminate the tragedy of underuse. <ref type="bibr">12</ref> This point is also true of the anticommons in knowledge. For example, when patents are blocking, efficiency would be improved by their joint use, which "could be brought about either by the sale of all the patents to a single firm (whether one of the patentees or a different firm altogether) or by a cross-licensing agreement that would permit each of the firms to use all the patents" <ref type="bibr">(Landes and Posner 2003: 383)</ref>. Such joint use, however, would not be socially optimal, because the single firm would have very strong market power or the result of the cross-licensing agreement "may be to disguise a cartel as a lawful patent monopoly" <ref type="bibr">(Landes and Posner 2003: 383)</ref>. This is the reason why patent pooling and cross-licensing on the patent side or the blanket licensing on the copyright side have been targets of careful antitrust scrutiny <ref type="bibr">(Landes and Posner 2003: 382, 383;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Heller and Eisenberg 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr">Heller 2008: 72, 73, 196)</ref>. Furthermore, it is particularly noteworthy that the result of the insiders' cooperation through these voluntary agreements is that access to and the free use and distribution of the "knowledge" by outside competitors and society at large will be restricted or blocked to a greater extent and therefore the positive knowledge externalities will be inhibited more significantly.</p><p>To sum up, the anticommons in knowledge is always tragic, while the anticommons in physical objects is not necessarily so. For society at large, the tragedy of the anticommons in knowledge will be much more tragic than that in physical objects. <ref type="bibr">Heller (2008: 21, 41, 42)</ref> notes that after he (1998) proposed the possibility of an anticommons tragedy, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Buchanan and Yoon (2000)</ref> "demonstrated my anticommons hypothesis mathematically" and "[a]ccording to their model, society gets the highest total value from a resource . . . when a single decision maker controls its use." Actually, however, Buchanan and Yoon's mathematical model fails to address the full range of anticommons problems identified in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Heller (1998)</ref>, and the authors' suggestion that the equilibrium under either the single ownership or efficient collective management is socially optimal is misleading.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Single Ownership Is Not the Way Out</head><p>As mentioned in the second section of this article, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Buchanan and Yoon (2000)</ref> considered neither localized negative externalities nor pervasive negative externalities in their model for commons and anticommons. Even when pervasive externalities are minor, their suggestion is still wrong, because the single owner has the market power, " <ref type="bibr">[u]</ref>nderuse can also arise in the monopoly context, when a single owner blocks access to a resource," and this situation will also be tragic <ref type="bibr">(Heller 2008: 45;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Coloma 2003)</ref>. The problem of underuse may disappear when there is perfect price discrimination <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Coloma 2003)</ref>, but "[i]n practice, perfect first-degree price discrimination is almost never possible" <ref type="bibr">(Pindyck and Rubinfeld 2001: 373, 407)</ref>. Even if perfect price discrimination is possible in practice, all of the consumer surplus will be captured by the monopolist as a result and it will most likely do much harm to social welfare in the long run, which is generally considered undesirable.</p><p>It seems that although in the commons/anticommons context there is still underuse under single ownership when pervasive externalities are minor, in the anticommons context alone collecting rights into single ownership may eliminate the tragedy of the anticommons and therefore improve the situation if pervasive externalities are minor. However, even if concerns about the adequacy of collecting rights into single ownership as a response to the underuse problems caused by an anticommons could be overcome, other problems remain. In practice "it is easier to fragment than to reconvene fragmented property" <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Parisi, Schulz, and Depoorter 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr">Heller 2008: 213)</ref>. As Heller pointed out, collecting rights from an anticommons into usable private property bundles is often brutal and slow, and both markets and governments may fail to do so <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Heller 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Heller and Eisenberg 1998)</ref>. For example, "[l]and is much easier to break up than to put back together."

Both markets and governments may find it difficult to dissolve barriers to knowledge production assembled under privatization. For example, one program can infringe many different software patents at once. Linux, the kernel of the GNU/Linux operating system, may have infringed as many as 283 different U.S. software patents <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Stallman 2005)</ref>.

A final point to remember is that in this emerging new era of technocapitalism, 15 even if these formidable obstacles to consolidation can be overcome, the intellectual monopoly created will likely be detrimental to the diversity and dynamics of knowledge development, replacing the "tragedy" of the anticommons with the "Sargasso Sea" of monopoly.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">How to Solve the Anticommons Tragedy in Knowledge</head><p>Intellectual property rights are the source of the tragedy of the anticommons in knowledge. It is impossible to find a socially beneficial way to overcome the tragedy within the legal framework of intellectual property. As discussed above, neither "cooperation" between multiple right holders (excluders) nor collecting rights into single ownership, if possible, is a socially beneficial way to overcome the anticommons tragedy in knowledge. On the contrary, these partial "solutions" risk blocking the free use and distribution of knowledge to an even greater extent. This is because of the negative meta-externalities of a well-established intellectual property regime.</p><p>13 <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>.2 in Heller's 2008 book, which comprises two pictures showing "[a] lone holdout in a Chinese project, March 2007" and "[t]he holdout, bulldozed, April 2007" respectively, is missing in the Chinese edition of the book <ref type="bibr">(Heller 2008: 113, 234, 235;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Heller 2009</ref>: 98-100). The holdout story in Chongqing, China behind the pictures was in the media spotlight in 2007. 14 In the commons context, on the one hand, single ownership will not eliminate underuse, if pervasive externalities are minor; on the other hand, even to the extent that in some circumstances single ownership may mitigate overuse of resources, the problem is that "most common property resources are vast" and it is not practical to privatize them <ref type="bibr">(Pindyck and Rubinfeld 2001: 643)</ref>. It may be practical to privatize the parking lot discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Buchanan and Yoon's (2000)</ref> model and assign usage and exclusion rights to a single owner, but "the air and waters surrounding us cannot readily be fenced" and therefore single ownership is by no means a way of solving such commons tragedies as a massive extinction of species in the oceans of the world, water and air pollution, and overpopulation (or what Hardin called the tragedy of "the commons in breeding") <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Hardin 1968</ref>). 15 I thank two of the reviewers of this article for their suggestion that I pay attention to this new version of capitalism. Douglas Kellner appeared to have coined the term "technocapitalism" in 1989 <ref type="bibr">(Kellner 2003: 31;</ref><ref type="bibr">Shaw 2008: 26)</ref>. According to Luis Suarez-Villa, technocapitalism is "a new form of capitalism that is heavily grounded on corporate power and its exploitation of technological creativity" <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Suarez-Villa 2001</ref>. "Meta-externalities" refer to the unintended consequences of legal and economic activities that can affect the broad contours of society and culture. Heterodox economists attend to them, while neoclassical economists usually ignore them <ref type="bibr">(Cohn 2007: 17, 49, 335)</ref>. Many heterodox economists are uneasy about the cultural and social implications of inhibiting free access to knowledge and information by society at large. Many philosophers find that privatizing and commercializing the results of scientific research-particularly patenting the results of research-is both epistemically and socially detrimental due to similar concerns <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Biddle 2012)</ref>.</p><p>The only epistemically and socially beneficial solution to the tragedy of the anticommons in knowledge lies in a return to a tradition of the commons. Historically in the United States the "commons has most often referred to shared spaces that allow for free speech and the democratic process, most notably the New England town commons" <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Hess and Ostrom 2006)</ref>.

The mainstream argues that the term, when used within the intellectual arena to frequently refer to the knowledge environment for free speech, universal open access, and self-governance, is only a battle cry <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Hess and Ostrom 2006)</ref>. Research on how to create and nurture a knowledge commons, however, is well underway in the United States. <ref type="bibr">16</ref> Regretfully, in China almost no attention has been paid to the "knowledge-commons" movement in the United States. As I pointed out in <ref type="bibr">Zhou (2011)</ref>, " <ref type="bibr">[v]</ref> ery few people in China have the courage to doubt or oppose the accepted doctrine of intellectual property rights and the legal system of intellectual property rights as a whole from the philosophical, political, economic, and jurisprudence angles." Unfortunately, the dogma of intellectual property rights prevalent in the United States is now in an even more dominant position within the intellectual arena in China than in the United States.</p><p>In this article, I use the term "knowledge commons" to refer to a knowledge environment of freedom in knowledge development and universal open access, and argue that development of the knowledge commons thus defined is the epistemically and socially beneficial solution to the tragedy of the knowledge anticommons. The knowledge commons is essentially distinct from naturalresource commons in that, as many scholars mentioned, knowledge in the knowledge commons, as a universal public good, is both nonexclusionary and nonrivalrous, while resources in naturalresource commons are more or less nonexclusionary but rivalrous <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Hess and Ostrom 2006)</ref>.</p><p>It is both nonexcludability and rivalrousness that together cause a natural-resource commons to be prone to the tragedy of overuse.

For an unmanaged commons, "[a]s overuse of resources reduces carrying capacity, ruin is inevitable." For a managed commons, it "describes either socialism or the privatism of free enterprise. Either one may work; either one may fail: 'The devil is in the details.'" Actually, however, "the privatism of free enterprise" will almost never "work."

The 'information-commons" movement emerged with striking suddenness. Before 1995, few thinkers saw the connection. It was around that time that we began to see a new usage of the concept of the 'commons.  also wrote that "[i]n the mid-1990s, articles suddenly started appearing in various disciplines addressing some aspect of this new knowledge commons" and that "[t]he largest wave of 'new-commons' exploration appeared in the legal reviews." multiple rational, self-interested owners (users) in a commons, will almost always deviate from the efficient point, as shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> (without considering the pervasive externalities) in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Coloma (2003)</ref>.</p><p>As for "socialism," Hardin may be right: it may work; it may fail.

Free access to knowledge will not be a disincentive to the creation of inventions and literary and artistic works. The real incentives for human knowledge creation are not financial as assumed in an intellectual property regime. The quest for knowledge is rooted in human nature. Ultimately, people produce knowledge "for the same reason that a silk worm produces silk" (Marx 1862-1863: addenda to part I). Natural incentives and passions for knowledge creation exist among pure (basic) researchers, artists, and numerous others conducting applied research in academic communities and elsewhere.

To solve this problem, establishment of alternative and competitive platforms, such as the free software platforms in the free software/open source movements, may be needed <ref type="bibr">(Zhou 2010</ref><ref type="bibr">(Zhou , 2011</ref> 31 Benkler wrote that "production is 'commons-based' when no one uses exclusive rights to organize effort or capture its value, and when cooperation is achieved through social mechanisms other than price signals or managerial directions," that "[l]arge-scale instances of such cooperation are 'peer production,'" and that "[f]ree software is the paradigm of commons-based production, as is the Linux kernel for peer production" <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Benkler 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr">Hess and Ostrom 2006: note 12)</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">‚àÇ ‚àÇ = + ‚àí + ‚àí ‚àí F s a bc p q p p s p p ‚àí2 [ ( )] ( ) 1 2 2 1 2 2 1 (10) 28 ‚àÇ ‚àÇ = ‚àí + ‚àí ‚àí &lt;

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusion</head><p>The anticommons in knowledge is distinct from the anticommons in physical objects. The former is always tragic, while the latter is not necessarily so. For society at large, the tragedy of the former will be much more tragic than the tragedy of the latter.</p><p>The neoliberal argument that single ownership is the socially optimal solution to the tragedy of the knowledge anticommons is misleading. Actually, intellectual property per se is the very source of the tragedy of the knowledge anticommons, and the tragedy is unavoidable so long as the intellectual property regime exists. The only epistemically and socially beneficial solution to the tragedy of the knowledge anticommons is to create, expand, and protect the knowledge commons. The comedy of the knowledge commons comes from the positive meta-externalities of performance of the knowledge commons. Some heterodox formal models can be constructed as metaphors for how the comedy works.</p><p>Hopefully, this article with heterodox results would be a piece of writing in support of the worldwide movement for free knowledge, a new wave of which includes the Academic Spring movement starting in 2012, the Cost of Knowledge project, and the Access2Research initiative, <ref type="bibr">32</ref> and it would also be a dissenting voice in China.</p></div>
