				<p>We identify the effect of confirmation-reports on dishonesty using data from an experiment where subjects are asked to roll a die and report its outcome using either a self-report or confirmation-report mechanism. We find that relative to self-reports, confirmation-reports have a positive effect on the share of subjects who report honestly. The effect on the magnitude of lies told depends greatly on the accuracy of the prefilled information on the confirmationreport. We argue that these results are driven by changes in the intrinsic costs of lying induced by the confirmation report.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>People often choose to misreport their private information in order to improve their own monetary payoffs. Common examples include used-car markets, auto-insurance, and tax returns. This behavior often occurs in response to one of two types of request for information. An individual may be asked to provide a self-report (e.g., what is your taxable income?) or a confirmationreport (e.g., is your taxable income $50,000?). Because both requests ask for the same information-the persons taxable income-we would expect a persons response to be independent of the form of the request. However, to the extent that intrinsic lying costs are affected by the form of information request, we speculate that dishonesty will be different between self-reports and confirmation-reports. 1 Confirmation-reports may affect several sources of intrinsic lying costs including moral-lying costs (how I see myself), social-lying costs related to changes in perception of the requesters information set (how others see me), and lying costs related to the mental burden of devising a lie.</p><p>Despite a very extensive literature on lying, there is very little empirical evidence on the relative effect of these two types of reports on dishonesty (see discussion below). We contribute to the literature by identifying the effect of confirmation-reports on dishonesty. We answer the following specific research questions; are people more likely to respond honestly to confirmation-reports than self-reports? Also, do confirmation-reports affect the magnitude of lies told? Because it is difficult to observe lying in historical data, we answer our research questions with data collected from an artefactual field-experiment. We follow the traditional dishonesty literature in that we ask subjects to report the outcome of a six-sided die roll <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Fischbacher and F€ ollmi-Heusi 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Jiang 2013</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Ruffle and Tobol 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Hao and Houser 2017)</ref>. Both the roll and reporting are done in private with no opportunity for either action to be observed by the experimenter. Subjects are paid according to their reported outcome, and their pay-offs are increasing in the reported die roll; with the exception of six, which receives a pay-off of zero. Therefore, subjects have an incentive to lie. Over 1400 subjects are recruited from Amazons mechanical turk, and are randomly assigned to one of seven groups. Subjects in group one are asked to make a self-report, while subjects in the remaining groups are asked to respond to a confirmation-report. The confirmation-reports are prefilled with a number between one and six, depending on the group, and subjects can either accept the report or reject it. Those who reject the report are given the opportunity to report any other number between one and six.</p><p>Our analysis reveals some important findings. First, the share of subjects who report rolling zero in the confirmation-report treatments is always greater than in the self-report treatment. This suggests, if anything, that confirmation-reports have a positive extrinsic-margin effect on honesty. Second, we find that the effect on the magnitude of lies told depends on the accuracy of the prefilled number. At one extreme, asking subjects to confirm rolling a six, which has a pay-off of zero, increases the share of zeroes by approximately eight percentage points and reduces the share of threes and fours by three percentage points each; there is no effect on the share of fives. At the other extreme, asking subjects to confirm rolling a five, which has the highest pay-off, increases the share of subjects who lie maximally by approximately seven percentage points, while reducing the shares of ones and fours by four percentage points, respectively. We suspect that these effects are being driven by some combination of intrinsic and extrinsic responses. Last, we find that females are more honest than males, and that females are less likely to lie maximally under the confirmation report while there is no effect on maximal lying among males.</p><p>Given the design of our experiment, we argue that these results are driven by intrinsic costs broadly defined to include moral lying-costs and lying costs related to the mental burden of whether or not and how much to lie. First, we argue that an accurately prefilled confirmationreport increases moral lying-costs and thus reduces dishonesty since subjects who face an accurate confirmation-report must reject the true report and then file a false report. Concurrently, a favorably inaccurate prefilled confirmation-report reduces moral lying-costs and thus increases dishonesty since subjects can "shift" the burden of lying onto the person who prepared the form. Second, the decision to lie is mentally burdensome since it generally involves two steps; the person must decide (i) whether or not to lie and (ii) the magnitude of the lie she wants to tell. The mental burden associated with these decisions is likely to be especially high given that liars generally want to maintain the perception of honesty <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Greenberg, Smeets, and Zhrakhovska 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Hao and Houser 2017)</ref>. In cases like these, people often turn to rules-of-thumb, which makes them susceptible to decision-making biases. Therefore, a subject might more readily accept an accurate or favorably inaccurate confirmation-report because it is easier than having to make the lying decision herself.</p><p>The presence of prefilled information on confirmation-reports might also change respondents beliefs about the requesters information set. 2 Therefore, it is also possible that our results are partly driven by another type of intrinsic cost related to the shame of being identified as a liar. However, the experiment is conducted in the field, and while subjects know they are participating in an academic study, they do not know that the die-rolling exercise is part of an experiment. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> Furthermore, we emphasize the fact that we have no way of observing their die roll. This suggests that our results are not being driven by such social costs related to changes in perception about the experimenters information set.</p><p>Our article makes several contributions to the academic literature and policy discussions. First, to our knowledge, we are the first to identify the effect of confirmation-reports on dishonesty in an environment where extrinsic costs do not matter. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Fonseca and Grimshaw (2017)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Kotakorpi and Laamanen (2015)</ref> estimate the compliance effect of administering an income tax with prepopulated tax forms rather than blank tax forms using data from a field experiment and a natural experiment, respectively. 4 Both studies find that a favorably inaccurate prefilled tax form increases noncompliance on the nonprefilled items. This finding is similar to our result where overstating the outcome of the die roll increases the share of subjects who confirm that die roll. Because these studies focus on tax evasion, the observed responses are driven by both extrinsic (audit and fine) and intrinsic costs. Unlike these two articles, we are able to show that confirmation-reports affect dishonesty even in the absence of extrinsic costs.</p><p>We also add to the extensive literature on lying. Existing studies have explored several important aspects of dishonesty including the role of shame <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Greenberg, Smeets, and Zhrakhovska 2015)</ref>, guilt <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Charness and Dufwenberg 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Battigalli, Charness, and Dufwenberg 2013)</ref>, perceived unfairness <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Houser, Vetter, and Winter 2012)</ref>, gender <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Dreber and Johannesson 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Muehlheusser, Roider, and Wallmeier 2015)</ref>, magnitude of pay-off <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Suri et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Fischbacher and F€ ollmi-Heusi 2013)</ref>, time preference (Ruffle and Tobol 2014), education (Ruffle and Tobol 2016), morality <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Shu et al. 2012)</ref>, and lying costs more broadly <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Gneezy 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Abeler, Becker, and Falk 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Kajackaite and Gneezy 2017)</ref>. A common feature of all of these studies is that they ask subjects to make self-reports using blank forms. We add to this literature by showing that the form of the request matters. Requesting information via confirmation-reports influences lying costs and thus increases or decreases dishonesty depending on the accuracy of the prefilled information on the reports. This finding is similar to studies that show that dishonesty can be influenced by changing lying costs either by having people commit to telling the truth <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Shu et al. 2012)</ref>, delegating the reporting responsibility <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Erat 2013)</ref>, or team incentives <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Conrads et al. 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Understanding the effect of self and confirmation reports on dishonesty is important for everyday life. It is particularly relevant in instances where people are hoping to obtain correct information but the provider of the information faces little or no extrinsic costs. For example, used-car markets and students giving excuses for missing exams or assignments. Other 2 On the one hand, a correctly prefilled report might cause people to believe that their private information is known to the requester. In this case, the social cost of lying increases because the person believes her decision to be dishonest will be observed by the requester; that is, she will be a known liar. On the other hand, an inaccurate confirmation-report might confirm the respondents belief that the requester does not know the respondents true information. In this case, the social cost of lying decreases because the decision to lie remains unknown to the requester. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> The dishonesty experiment was conducted after the subjects had completed a survey about public opinion toward road user-charges. See implementation subsection for details. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> Prepopulated tax forms require taxpayers to complete their annual tax reconciliation by filing a form that is prefilled with information available to the tax administrator, and is therefore comparable to a confirmation-report. applications include state-provided services for which there are no penalties for lying. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> There is also an obvious application to tax administration. 6 However, we are careful in extrapolating our results to this context because cheating on taxes is a risky decision that includes extrinsic costs. Still, our results suggest that the type of form used in the reconciliation process matters for compliance, and that the effect of the form will depend crucially on the accuracy of the information available to the administrator. Policymakers who wish to prefill tax returns for taxpayers for whom true income is uncertain should prefill forms with a higher rather than lower numbers to reduce noncompliance. However, as a matter of practical policy making, it might not be ethical for the government to submit prefilled forms with information that is known to be inaccurate. Therefore, policymakers who implement prepopulated forms often limit them to taxpayers with known information, and our results also support this strategy. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> The remainder of the article is organized as follows. First, we describe the experimental design. This is followed by a description of our results, discussion and conclusion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Design and Implementation</head><p>Our primary objective is to determine if, relative to self-reports, confirmation-reports lead to more liars and larger lies in a context where extrinsic costs do not matter. This section describes the experimental design used to answer our research question.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental Design</head><p>The experiment is completed in two steps. First, we instruct subjects to roll a six-sided die and make a note of the number thrown on their first attempt. Subjects are told that they can throw the die as many times as they want, but only the first throw counts. Second, subjects are asked to report the outcome of their die roll. The subjects are told that we have no way of knowing the outcome of the die roll, and that their payment will be based solely on the number they report following the schedule in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>. <ref type="bibr">8</ref> The information in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> is shown to the subjects twice; when they read the instructions for the experiment and again when they make their reporting decisions.</p><p>Park in Indianapolis, Indiana charges a lower fee for residence of Marion county. However, there is no process in place to verify patrons county of residence. 6 While most tax administrators implement tax reconciliations with blank-tax forms, others use prepopulated forms.</p><p>Prepopulated tax forms are used in Finland, Denmark, Sweden, Norway. The United Kingdom is currently considering the adoption of prepopulated tax forms. Although there has been discussions about the merits of a prepopulated tax form in the United States, the State of California is the only U.S. government to have implemented them under their ready-return initiative. ReadyReturn has since been cancelled, but its primary feature-prepopulating tax forms with pre-existing information-is still available with CalFile. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> Of course, this strategy does not preclude the possibility of increased noncompliance among taxpayers who have only verifiable income in the current period, but earn income from nonverifiable sources in the future. Confirmation-reports could also increase noncompliance by inducing taxpayers to reduce their verifiable income and increase their nonverifiable income. 8 Notice that the payment for rolling a six is zero as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Fischbacher and F€ ollmi-Heusi (2013)</ref>. Because the pay-off for rolling a six is zero, we recode the outcome six to be zero. This adjustment is made to the data for all tables and figures reported in the article. This design conforms with the previous literature; for example, Fischbacher and F€ ollmi-Heusi (2013); <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Ruffle and Tobol (2014)</ref>. The main difference between our design and that of the existing literature is in the way subjects are asked to report the outcome of the die roll. The previous literature simply asked subjects to self-report the outcome of the die roll. We add to this by also asking some subjects to provide confirmation-reports. Subjects are randomly assigned to one of seven groups; one self-report treatment and six confirmation-report treatments. The only difference between the self-report treatment and the confirmation-report treatment is in step two where subjects are asked to report the die roll outcome.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Self-Report Treatment</head><p>Subjects in the Self Report Treatment (SRT) are shown an empty text box and are asked to report the outcome of their first die roll (see <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>). We again show subjects Table 1 so that the relationship between the reported number and the bonus payment remains salient. We also remind them that we have no way of knowing the number that they actually rolled on the die. The session ends when a subject submits the reported die roll.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Confirmation-Report Treatment</head><p>Subjects in the Confirmation Report Treatments (CRT) are randomly assigned to one of six subgroups. Subjects in each group are shown a text box that is prefilled with a fixed number; either 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 depending on their assigned group (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref>). In other words, every subject assigned to CRT0 is shown a text box that is prefilled with the number 6. Similarly, every subject assigned to CRT5 is shown a text box that is prefilled with the number 5, and so on. Subjects are asked to confirm whether the prefilled number is the number on the face of their first die roll. The prefilled number is reported and the session ends if they respond "yes." Subjects who respond "no" are given an opportunity to self-report a different number.</p><p>We use a between-subject design, where each subject only participates in one of the seven treatments, and makes her rolling and reporting decisions once.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Implementation</head><p>Because the design is simple and can be completed in only a few minutes, we implement the experiment online with the aid of Amazons Mechanical Turk (Mturk). 9 Mturk is an online labor market where job offers are posted and workers choose jobs for payment. It has numerous benefits for running experiments, including access to a large stable subject pool, diverse subject background, and low costs <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Horton and Chilton 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Paolacci, Chandler, and Ipeirotis 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Mason and Suri 2012)</ref>. Furthermore, the behavior of online workers has been shown to be comparable to those of subjects in laboratory studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Paolacci, Chandler, and Ipeirotis 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Buhrmester, Kwang, and Gosling 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Horton, Rand, and Zeckhauser 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Suri et al. 2011)</ref>.</p><p>We create a survey-based human intelligence task (HIT) on Mturk (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref>) and provide a link to our own website where subjects are able to complete the survey and a bonus task. 10 Following the survey, subjects are asked to complete a bonus task, which involves rolling a six-sided die and reporting the outcome. Subjects receive task instructions shown in Figures 4 and 5. They are told that the amount of the bonus payment is determined by the reported die roll according to <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>. A link to the website random.org, which allows people to roll virtual die, is embedded into our website. Subjects are instructed to click on the link in order to roll the die, and to return to our website to report the outcome of the die roll. We make it explicitly clear that our website is not affiliated with random.org, so the Subjects took an average of nine minutes to complete both stages of the experiment, and 50% of subjects completed the experiment in less than 5 minutes and 20 seconds. <ref type="bibr">10</ref> We created the external website for the sole purpose of hosting the survey and bonus task. The survey includes questions about road mileage user-fees, number of miles driven, age, gender, race, and education. Subjects are paid a flat participation fee for completing the survey. The experiment was done in December 2015 and January of 2016. actual outcome of the die roll is not known to us. Subjects are told that we can only observe the number that they report on our website. Subjects are shown an ID code after submitting their reported die roll, and are told to report this code on the Mturk website in order for us to process their bonus payment.</p><p>Mturk is especially advantageous for our study because subjects can be assured that we have no way of telling whether they are lying or not. Subjects complete the tasks in their own environment immune to the influence from other participants or the experimenters. Therefore, the design does not involve any social interactions. Additionally, the experiment does not include a compliance mechanism; that is, no audit, no penalty, and no opportunity  for the experimenter to observe a subjects actions. This implies that the actual and expected extrinsic costs of lying are zero. We argue that these two characteristics of the experimental design implies that the decision to be dishonest in our experiment depends only on a tradeoff between the external monetary benefits and the internal costs of the dishonest act.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Results</head><p>This section begins with a description of our data. We then describe dishonesty in the self-report treatment, which serves as our baseline. Next, we describe dishonesty in the confirmation-report treatments followed by additional analyses that account for gender effects as well as dishonesty among subjects whom we know rolled the virtual die versus those who probably did not roll a die.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Summary Statistics</head><p>A total of 1475 subjects participated in the experiment, which translates into approximately 200 subjects per treatment. Subjects took an average of nine minutes to complete the survey and bonus task, and were paid an average of $0.81; this is equivalent to an hourly wage of approximately $5.40. Our hourly wage is comparable to that of other surveys conducted on Mturk (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Kuziemko et al. 2015 paid $6</ref>.00 per hour), and much higher than the estimated reservation wage of Mturk workers; $1.38 <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Horton and Chilton 2010)</ref>. <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> shows that CRT treatments CRT0, CRT3, CRT4, and CRT5 are balanced with respect to age, gender, race, and education, relative to the control group (SRT). CRT1 is also well balanced compared to SRT except that CRT1 has slightly less females. The treatment group CRT2 has fewer females and whites and more college educated subjects.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Uniformity of Random.org</head><p>Since subjects rolled a virtual die through random.org, it is important to establish that the virtual die on this website is fair. Because each group has 203-225 observations, we provide evidence that the virtual die is fair by collecting the outcome of approximately 210 die rolls from random.org and present the resulting distribution in <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>. The evidence presented in <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> shows that the virtual die is fair. We cannot reject the null that the distribution obtained from random.org is uniform: p value from Kolmogorov-Smirnov two-sample test is 0.97 and p values from  <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>. Distribution of Virtual Die Roll Outcomes. Notes: Reported is the distribution of die outcomes from the website Random.org. Because the pay-off for rolling a 6 is zero, we recode the outcome 6 as 0. The horizontal line indicates 16.67%. [Color figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com] two-sided binomial tests that the share of each reported number is equal to 16.67% are all greater than 0.2. We take this as evidence that each of the observed distributions from our experiment should be uniform if subjects report honestly.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Self-Report Treatment Results</head><p>Result 1. We Find Strong Evidence for an Overall Pattern of Dishonesty Among Subjects The distribution of reported die rolls in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 7</ref> indicates the presence of lying in SRT. Subjects report low-paying numbers at frequencies below 16.67% and report high-paying numbers at frequencies above 16.67%, which is indicative of dishonesty. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov two-sample test confirms that the observed distribution is statistically different from a uniform distribution (pvalue &lt; 1%). This is further supported by a two-sided binomial test that the share of subjects reporting each number is equal to 16.67%; we can reject the null that the share of reported 0, 2 and 5 is 16.67% at the 1% level. However, we cannot reject that the share of 1, 3, and 4 is 16.67%. This finding implies that some subjects lied about their die roll and reported higher numbers than what they actually rolled.</p><p>Since there is no incentive for people to lie for lower payoffs, it is reasonable to assume that subjects who report a zero payoff are honest. In our experiment, 7.4% of subjects in SRT report a die roll of 6, which results in a zero payoff. Following Fischbacher and F€ ollmi-Heusi (2013), we use this information to estimate the percentage of unconditionally honest subjects to be approximately 44% (57:4% Ã 6). 11 In other words, we find that 44% of subjects are honest despite the fact that lying is both unobservable and profitable. The SRT results also provide evidence of maximal lying. We find that 32% of the subjects in SRT report a payoff of 5, which is statistically greater than the expected probability of 1/6. This implies that some subjects lied to maximize their payoffs. Since there is no incentive for subjects who rolled 5 to report a lower payoff, we estimate the percentage of maximal liars to be 18% (5ð32216:7Þ Ã ð6=5Þ).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Confirmation-Report Treatment</head><p>Recall that the confirmation treatment is divided into six subgroups where every subject in a given subgroup is asked to confirm the same prefilled number. We therefore are able to disaggregate the CRT results into its component groups and compare each subgroup to SRT.</p><p>Result 2. The Disaggregated CRT Data Show that Dishonesty Persists Regardless of the Prefilled Number <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 8</ref> presents the distribution of reported payoffs for each CRT subgroup. 12 A Kolmogorov-Smirnov two-sample test confirms that the observed distributions in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 8</ref> are statistically different from a uniform distribution (pvalues &lt; 5%), which suggests the presence of lying across all groups. Visual inspection suggests that dishonesty is influenced by the prefilled number. For example, the share of maximal liars is highest in Panels A, B, and F, where subjects are asked to confirm zero, one, and five, respectively. We also observe that the share of partial liars (based solely on the share of reported fours) is highest in Panels C, D, and E where subjects are asked to confirm two, three, and four, respectively. Additionally, the observed distribution that most closely resembles a uniform distribution is Panel A where subjects were asked to confirm rolling a 6. Only the reported share of twos and fives in Panel A of Figure 8 can be distinguished from 16.67% according to a two-sided binomial test, while at least four of the six bars in the remaining panels of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 8</ref> can be distinguished from 16.67%.</p><p>Result 3. The Share of Subjects Confirming a Prefilled Number Increases in the Pay-off Associated with That Number <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 8</ref> also shows that the share of subjects confirming a given prefilled number is increasing in the prefilled number, and almost always greater than the expected share of 16.67%. To see this more clearly, we present-in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 9</ref>-the share of subjects in each group who confirm the number they are shown on their prefilled report. We refer to these subjects as confirmers. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 9</ref> shows clearly that subjects are more likely to confirm a one than a zero, and more likely to confirm a two than a one, and so on. Notice that this finding is inconsistent with honest reporting. In other words, the share of confirmers should be equal to 16.67% if subjects are reporting honestly. Relative to SRT (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 7)</ref>, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 9</ref> shows that the share of subjects confirming a given prefilled number is greater than the share of subjects who self-report that same number. To illustrate this treatment effect more clearly, we compare each CRT sub-group in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 8</ref> to SRT in  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 7</ref>. For example, we identify the treatment effect of CRT0 by subtracting the share of subjects who self-report each number in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 7</ref> from the share of subjects who report the respective number in Panel A of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 8</ref>. We repeat this for each panel in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 8</ref> in order to identify the treatment effect of the other prefilled numbers. The results from this exercise are reported in <ref type="bibr">Figure 10</ref>; each panel reports the treatment effect for a different CRT subgroup. <ref type="figure">Figure 10</ref> shows that relative to SRT, confirmation reports increase the share of subjects who report a given prefilled number by 6.5-11.8 percentage points across all groups. These effects are both economically meaningful and statistically different from zero, and is further evidence that confirmation reports influence reporting behavior.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Result 5. The Extensive and Intensive Margin Lying Responses Vary Across Subgroups</head><p>An interesting question to ask at this point is whether or not confirmation-reports affect the share of honest subjects, and the share of partial and maximal liars. The results in <ref type="figure">Figure 10</ref> shed some light on this question. First, we find evidence of a positive extensive-margin effect; the confirmation-reports caused an increase in the share of honest subjects. The treatment effects in Panel A of <ref type="figure">Figure 10</ref> show that the share of zeroes increases, the share of threes and fours decreases, and there is no economically significant effect on any other number. Since no one has an incentive to report a smaller number than she actually rolled, this suggests that the Value Reported</p><p>Panel F: CRT5 <ref type="figure">Figure 10</ref>.

For each panel, each bar represents the share of subjects reporting that number in the respective CRT minus the share of subjects reporting that number in SRT. Because the pay-off for rolling a 6 is zero, we recode the outcome 6 as 0.</p><p>confirmation report in CRT0 reduces the share of partial liars, and increases the share of subjects who report honestly by 8 percentage points. <ref type="bibr">13</ref> The treatment effect in each of the remaining confirmation-report treatments reflect both extensive and intensive margin responses, and it is difficult to separate the two because we do not know the true outcome for each subject. For example, we observe a significant reduction in the share of reported threes and fours coupled with an increase in the share of reported ones in CRT1 (Panel B of <ref type="figure">Figure 10</ref>). This suggests that subjects who would have self-reported threes and fours report a one when presented with a CRT1. This behavior is consistent with two possible explanations related to extensive and intensive margin lying-responses. On the one hand, it is possible that subjects who rolled a one and would have lied by self-reporting a three now report honestly, thus reflecting an extensive margin response. On the other hand, CRT1 could also reflect an intensive margin response in the sense that subjects who rolled a six now lie less intensely by reporting one instead of a three. Our data do not allow us to distinguish between these two possible effects, but we suspect that some combination of the two is at play.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Rollers</head><p>Subjects who are committed to lying might find it pointless to roll the die since their reported outcome will be independent of the die roll. However, it is usually impossible to tell if subjects rolled the die because they make their die roll and reporting decisions in private. This information is important in our context since it is possible that subjects who are committed liars respond differently to the treatment than other subjects. Therefore, we designed the experiment such that we can identify subjects who clicked on the die-roll link. We refer to those subjects who clicked on the link as "rollers," and those who did not click on the link as "non-rollers." 14 This section describes how our results are affected when we cut the data by roller status. <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 4</ref> shows that approximately 36% of subjects in both SRT and CRT are nonrollers; that is, they did not click on the die-roll link before making their reporting decision. With the exception of CRT1 (30%) and CRT2 (40%), this share is fairly flat across CRT subgroups. Additionally, there is no difference in the likelihood of being a nonroller across gender or race. Younger subjects are more likely to be nonrollers, but the estimated effect is not economically meaningful. The only demographic characteristic that is strongly correlated with nonroller is education level; the likelihood of being a nonroller decreases with education level. 15 These differences are not worrisome since the treatment groups are balanced with respect to education level. However, given that each subjects is 7.4%, just as in SRT, (ii) the confirmation-report does not affect the propensity to report any of the other numbers honestly, and (iii) subjects who report a zero payoff are honest. The first assumption follows from randomization of subjects into groups. The fact that the share of zeroes in each panel of <ref type="figure">Figure 10</ref> is not statistically different from 7.4% is further evidence that the share of unconditionally honest subjects is at least 7.4% across all groups. The second assumption is supported by the treatment effects in Panel A of <ref type="figure">Figure 10.</ref> 14 We are only able to tell if the link was clicked; we cannot observe the outcome of the die roll. Also, we cannot rule out the possibility that nonrollers actually rolled a die. For example, it is possible that they simply bypassed our link to the virtual die, or that they rolled their own physical die. As mentioned before, our inability to observe the die outcome was made clear to subjects. <ref type="bibr">15</ref> The share of nonrollers among subjects with a graduate degree is 25%.

Subjects Who Clicked on the Die-Roll Link are More Honest than Subjects Who Did Not Click on the Link <ref type="figure">Figure 11</ref> presents the distribution of reported die rolls for SRT conditional on roller status. Although the observed distributions are all statistically different from a uniform distribution, the results clearly suggest that rollers are more honest than nonrollers. <ref type="bibr">16</ref> In particular, relative to nonrollers, rollers report a greater share of zeroes and a lower share of fives. The difference between rollers and nonrollers in the propensity to lie is also apparent in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figures 12 and 13</ref>, which report results for rollers and nonrollers in the CRT treatments, respectively. Again, while the observed distributions among rollers suggests the presence of lying, we find even stronger evidence of lying among nonrollers.</p></div>

We discuss the implications of this finding for our main results in section 4.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p>The empirical results described in results section show evidence of both honest and dishonest subjects. We also find that not all subjects lie maximally. Importantly, we estimate that the CRT has an economically meaningful effect on the share of subjects who report each number, but the magnitude depends greatly on the prefilled number in the CRT. This section places our findings to the context of the existing literature and offers possible explanations for the observed treatment effects.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Relation to Literature</head><p>Our baseline findings reported in self-report treatment results section are consistent with the existing literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Suri et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Fischbacher and F€ ollmi-Heusi 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Jiang 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Abeler, Becker, and Falk 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Ruffle and Tobol 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Hao and Houser 2017)</ref>. A particularly useful point of comparison is Fischbacher and F€ ollmi-Heusi (2013) whose baseline-experimental design is similar to our SRT treatment. They estimate that their sample includes 39% unconditionally honest subjects, 22% maximal liars, and a nontrivial amount of partial lying. Our results are largely comparable to theirs, which is reassuring on two levels. First, though use of the mTurk subject pool has grown significantly in recent years, there still remains some skepticism. Therefore, the fact that Fischbacher and F€ ollmi-Heusi (2013) baseline results are replicated in the mTurk sample ought to increase confidence in our results. Second, mTurkers generally complete HITs for very low wages and as such the stakes in our experiment are low relative to the existing literature. For example, ignoring exchange rate differences, the stakes in Fischbacher and F€ ollmi-Heusi (2013) are 10 times as high as in our experiment. Still, our baseline results are very similar to theirs, which suggests Notes: Reported is the effect gender on reporting behavior for the confirmation-report treatments. For each panel, each bar represents the share of females reporting that number minus the share of males reporting that number. Because the pay-off for rolling a 6 is zero, we recode the outcome 6 as 0.</p><p>that the size of the stake is not that important in matters of dishonesty (at least not in the context that we explore). <ref type="bibr">19</ref> We also note that our treatment effects are consistent with Fonseca and Grimshaw (2017) who find that correctly prepopulated tax returns have a small positive effect on compliance relative to a blank return. Like us, they also find that prepopulating a return with too low values for income (similar to overstating the die outcome in our case) increases dishonesty.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Channels</head><p>Again, the novelty of our experiment is that we test whether confirmation-reports cause subjects to become more or less honest in an environment where there are no extrinsic lying costs. Our results suggest that, overall, confirmation reports increase honesty. However, we also observe that the effect of CRT depends on the prefilled information and whether or not the subject clicked our roll-die link. We argue that this heterogenous effect is due to intrinsic costs broadly defined to include moral lying-costs and decision-making costs related to the mental burden of whether and how much to lie.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Moral Lying-Costs</head><p>Dishonesty is morally costly for individuals because they must violate their moral standards in order to engage in a dishonest act <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bandura 1990</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bandura , 1996</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Aquino and Reed II 2002)</ref>. We argue that confirmation-reports affect the moral cost of lying by changing the salience of subjects own moral standards. For example, a subject who faces an accurate confirmation-report has to engage in two distinct dishonest acts if she wishes to lie; she must reject the true statement, then report a false statement. These two decisions have a greater effect in activating her moral standards relative to a self-report, and thus increases the moral costs of lying. On the other hand, CRT reduces the moral-lying costs of subjects who are asked to confirm an advantageous false statement because they can shift the blame of lying to the person who prepared the confirmation report without necessarily activating her own moral standards. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Erat (2013)</ref> finds that people are more likely to lie if the burden of lying can be shifted to a delegate. We argue that these opposing effects on the moral cost of lying is a possible explanation for our results.</p><p>To illustrate, let us take to the two extreme pay-off numbers of zero (lowest pay-off) and five (highest pay-off). CRT subjects who roll a zero and are asked to confirm a zero face higher lying costs relative to subjects who rolled a zero in SRT. We would therefore expect an increase in the share of reported zeroes in CRT relative to SRT, and this is exactly what we find. Importantly, because there is no incentive to report a zero unless it is the truth, we can interpret the increase in the share of reported zeroes as an increase in honesty. Similarly, CRT subjects who rolled a number less than five, but are asked to confirm rolling a five, face lower lying costs relative to SRT subjects who rolled a number less than five. Therefore, we would expect an increase in the share of reported fives in CRT5 relative to SRT. Again, this is what we find. Because subjects do not have an incentive to report a number lower than their actual roll, we argue that the treatment effect for reported fives in CRT5 reflects an increase in dishonesty.</p><p>We can use the same logic to explain the responses for the intermediate numbers one to four. Consider, for example, the number three. We can classify subjects who are asked to confirm the number three into four bins: (i) those who roll a number lower than three, and would self-report a number lower than three, (ii) those who roll a number lower than three, but would self-report a number greater than or equal to three, (iii) those who roll the number three, and (iv) those who roll a number greater than three. Prefilling the confirmation report with the number three reduces the lying cost for subjects in the first two bins and increases the lying cost for those in the third bin. The impact on lying costs for those who roll a four is unclear. This suggests that the share of reported threes should increase, which is what we observe, and that this effect is driven by the response of subjects in the first three bins. The greater share of threes reflects an increase in lying among subjects in the first bin since they experience lower lying costs. It also possibly includes a reduction in the magnitude of the lie told by subjects in the second bin. In other words, subjects who roll a one and would have self-reported a five now report a three; they still lie, but the magnitude of the lie is smaller. Finally, the effect of prefilling the report with the number three includes increased honesty among subjects who actually roll a three because these subjects experience higher lying costs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Decision-Making Costs</head><p>Another possible explanation for our findings is that subjects simply accept the number that is prepopulated because it is the default setting of the confirmation report. Economists have highlighted in numerous areas, including health care plans <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Samuelson and Zeckhauser 1988)</ref>, automobile insurance <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Johnson et al. 1993)</ref>, retirement saving plans <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Madrian and Shea 2001)</ref>, and organ donor registration <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Johnson and Goldstein 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Li, Hawley, and Schnier 2013)</ref>, that people often choose the default option they are assigned in order to reduce decision-making costs. Because it is less mentally burdensome to accept the default number shown on the confirmation report than to decide on a number to report, we would expect subjects who roll a number x y to be more likely to confirm rolling y than self-reporting y. We argue that this channel is especially relevant among nonrollers. To the extent that nonrollers did not in fact roll a die, they need to decide which number to self-report in order to maximize their pay-off while maintaining a semblance of honesty. <ref type="bibr">20</ref> The default option presented in the confirmation-report simplifies this decisionmaking calculus by allowing the subject to simply accept the prepopulated number. Unlike rollers, nonrollers do not have an actual die outcome (x) with which to compare the prepopulated number (y). Therefore, it is not surprising that, relative to rollers, nonrollers are more likely to accept y, thus leading to much larger treatment effects among nonrollers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Shame</head><p>It is also possible that our result is driven by shame aversion induced by a change in subjects beliefs about the researchers information set. The argument goes as follows. Upon seeing a prefilled number, subjects update their beliefs of the accuracy of the researchers information set regarding the actual die outcome. Subjects who see a prefilled number equal to their actual die roll now believe that the researcher knows the actual outcome, and will therefore report accurately. Subjects who see a prefilled number that is different from their actual die roll will confirm their prior belief that the researchers do not know the actual outcome, and are therefore more likely to confirm a favorable false statement. Note that in both cases the effect of the updated beliefs on lying works through its effect on intrinsic costs only. <ref type="bibr">21</ref> In other words, subjects wish to lie, but would like to appear honest in order to avoid the shame of being known as a liar <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Greenberg, Smeets, and Zhrakhovska 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Hao and Houser 2017)</ref>. As a result, subjects who believe the researchers information set is correct are more likely to confirm an accurately prefilled confirmation report while those who believe the researchers information set is inaccurate are more likely to confirm a favorably inaccurate confirmation report.</p><p>We argue that this mechanism is an unlikely reason for our results given the design of the experiment. First, we make it explicitly clear to subjects that our website is not connected to random.org in anyway, and that we cannot observe their die rolls. Second, subjects know that we only observe their mTurk ID and therefore have no way of knowing any of them personally. Third, the actual reported outcomes appear to be inconsistent with this explanation. For example, if prefilling the form with say three, fours and fives lead subjects who roll a zero to believe we do not know their actual outcomes, then we would expect to observe a significant drop in the share of reported zeroes in treatments CRT3, CRT4, and CRT5 relative to SRT and relative to CRT0, CRT1 and CRT2. However, the share of reported zeroes is basically constant across all of these treatments.</p><p>Finally, we also rule out this alternate explanation based on the fact that subjects who did not click on the "die roll" link embedded in our website responded similarly to those who did click on the link. Subjects belief of the researchers information set should be unaffected by the prefilled number for subjects who did not click on the "die roll" link. This is because these subjects either rolled a physical die, rolled a virtual die on some other website, bypassed our weblink in order to roll the die on random.org, or did not roll a die at all. In either case, these subjects should be reassured that the researchers do not know the actual outcome of the die roll, and so, their beliefs of the researchers information set should be independent of the prefilled number. This suggests that the treatment effect of CRT0 on the share of subjects who confirm rolling zero should be lower among nonrollers relative to rollers. Similarly, the treatment effect of CRT5 on the share of subjects who confirm rolling five should be higher among nonrollers relative to rollers. However, this is not what we observe. In fact, the treatment effect of CRT0 on confirmed zeroes is much higher among nonrollers, while the treatment effect of CRT5 on confirmed fives is lower among nonrollers. This suggests that a change in beliefs about the probability of being observed is not the driving factor.</p><p>Of course we cannot rule out the possibility that different subjects are influenced by different factors. For example, it is possible that nonrollers are influenced by decision-making costs while rollers are mostly influenced by moral costs with some residual social (shame) costs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Policy Implications</head><p>Our findings are important for policy areas where information requests can reasonably take the form of either a self-report or a confirmation-report; for example, tax administration. Several countries have adopted prepopulated tax forms, and others are considering adoption. It is generally argued that a prepopulated tax system lowers compliance costs and thus increases tax compliance. However, there is very little empirical evidence on the compliance effects of prepopulated tax systems; <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Fonseca and Grimshaw (2017)</ref> provide experimental evidence for the UK and <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Kotakorpi and Laamanen (2015)</ref> evaluate the effect of Finlands switch to prepopulated returns.</p><p>While our experiment is not framed as a study of tax compliance, the results do provide some insights into the possible effects of prepopulation since prepopulated tax systems rely on confirmation-reports. <ref type="bibr">22</ref> For example, we show that the effect of confirmation-reports on honesty (and hence tax compliance) depends greatly on the accuracy of the prepopulated information. Consider taxpayers who have both third-party reported (e.g., wage income subject to W2 reporting in the US) and self-employment income (e.g., income reported on form 1099 in the US). These taxpayers may be of one of three types. The first type of taxpayer reports some of her W2 income and none of her self-employment income. Our results suggest that switching to prepopulated tax returns under these conditions would increase compliance for two reasons: (i) people are more likely to confirm prefilled information that is favorably inaccurate, and (ii) W2 income is easily verifiable. <ref type="bibr">23</ref> Of course, compliance with third-party income is already very high; for example, estimates put the compliance rate for W2 income at 99% in the United States <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Slemrod 2007)</ref>. Therefore, the positive effect on compliance from the introduction of prepopulated tax returns among this group of taxpayers is likely to be very small.</p><p>The second type of taxpayer fully reports W2 income and none of the self-employment income. The compliance rate among these taxpayers is likely to be unaffected by a switch to prefilled tax returns because the prefilled return reflects what the taxpayer would have self-reported. Finally, there are taxpayers who report all of their W2 income and some or all of their selfemployment income. Our results suggest that switching to prepopulated tax forms that are based solely on third-party reported information would increase noncompliance among these taxpayers. This follows from the fact that people are more likely to confirm favorably inaccurate information. Notice that in this case, the prepopulated information on total income is both inaccurate and lower than what the taxpayer would have self-reported. Another implication of our findings is that policymakers who wish to reduce noncompliance among these two types of taxpayers could prefill self-employment income on tax forms with high income values. 24 However, as a matter of practical policy making, it might be unethical for the government to knowingly provide taxpayers with inaccurate prefilled tax returns. Therefore, we recommend that policymakers who wish to implement prepopulated tax forms limit them to taxpayers whose income is easily verifiable.</p><p>Overall, the net effect of switching to prepopulated tax forms on compliance depends on the distribution of third-party and nonthird-party reported income. We would expect a small positive effect on compliance if all income is subject to third-party reporting. This is because compliance with third-party income is already very high. However, the net effect depends on the existing level of compliance if there is at least some income not subject to third-party reporting. <ref type="bibr">22</ref> Recall that our experiment does not include any extrinsic costs. Therefore, our findings/policy implications are based solely on the direct effect of the form, and excludes any indirect effects that might occur through perceived (or actual) changes in extrinsic costs. <ref type="bibr">23</ref> The taxpayer is unlikely to reduce the prefilled W2 income because she knows that the tax administrator has thirdparty information on her W2 income. This effect is also likely to hold for taxpayers who only have third-party reported income. <ref type="bibr">24</ref> The determination of self-employment status as well as realistic "high" values for self-employment income could be determined from tax returns of previous years.</p><p>Of course, the importance of accuracy is not a new finding. <ref type="bibr">25</ref> What is novel in our setting is that we show that this compliance effect exists even in the absence of extrinsic evasion costs; that is, costs related to being audited and fined. We argue that this effect is driven by changes in the intrinsic costs of lying that are induced by the confirmation-report; while accurate information increases intrinsic lying costs, inaccurate information reduces intrinsic lying costs.</p><p>Another application closely related to our field experiment context is the reporting of annual vehicle miles traveled (VMT) for auto-insurance policies. Auto insurers often ask policy holders to self-report their annual VMT and use this information in pricing insurance policies. Those who drive more tend to have a higher accident risk and are therefore charged higher insurance premiums. Therefore, policyholders have an incentive to underreport their VMT. <ref type="bibr">26</ref> Insurance companies can rely on several techniques to obtain accurate mileage information. 27 One suggested technique uses two steps. First, known information about customers is used to predict their annual mileage; for example, gender, age, education, employment commute times, vehicle type, and vehicle age. Second, customers are asked to confirm that the predicted mileage is correct using confirmation reports. The effect of this approach on underreporting depends on the accuracy of the predicted mileage. Assuming that the predicted mileage is fairly accurate, our findings suggest that this approach could significantly reduce the under-reporting problem.</p><p>A similar strategy might also prove useful if road mileage user-fees become widely adopted. Ideally, a road mileage user-fee would be implemented with the aid of advanced technology that accurately measures vehicle mileage. However, due to costs and privacy concerns, there has been some resistance to mileage user-fees and the use of advanced technology in particular <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Duncan et al. 2014</ref>). Because of these costs and privacy concerns, administration with odometer readings is generally included as an optional way of collecting mileage information. While odometer reading largely solves the privacy and cost problems, it raises concerns about evasion. Our results suggest that obtaining a fairly accurate estimate of vehicle miles traveled coupled with a confirmation report is likely to reduce noncompliance. This could serve to reduce the number of required audits and hence the cost of administration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusion</head><p>We implement a field experiment to study the effect of confirmation reports on dishonesty. Subjects are recruited from Amazons Mechanical Turk labor pool. Each subject is asked to roll a virtual die and report the outcome of the die roll either by completing a self-report or confirmation report. We find strong evidence of lying in both treatments. We also find that the effect of confirmation report is heterogenous across prefilled number, gender, and roller status. Overall, we find that people are more likely to confirm the truth than to self-report the truth, and more likely to confirm a lie than to tell a lie. We attribute our findings to intrinsic costs which are influenced through the impact of confirmation reports on moral-lying costs and decision-making costs. <ref type="bibr">25</ref> Almost all countries with a prepopulated tax system either limit to their system to (or began with) taxpayers with only wage income that is easily monitored for accuracy. <ref type="bibr">26</ref> According to a 2008 report by Quality Planning company, the car insurance industry missed out on $15.9 billion in revenues of which more than $3 billion is due to underreported vehicle mileage. <ref type="bibr">27</ref> These include asking the customer, asking the agent, historical odometer readings, mileage models, and telematics using an after-market device, smartphone OEM-based or smartphone odometer app <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Cantwell 2015)</ref>.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Die Reporting Screenshot for Confirmation-Report Treatments.
