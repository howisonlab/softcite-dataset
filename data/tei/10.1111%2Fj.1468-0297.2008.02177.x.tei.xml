			<abstract>
				<p>An earlier paper showed that an economy could be trapped in an equilibrium state in which the absence of the rule of law led to asset-stripping and the prevalence of asset-stripping led to the absence of a demand for the rule of law, highlighting a coordination failure. This article looks more carefully at the dynamics of transition from a non-rule-of-law state. The article identifies a commitment problem as the critical feature inhibiting the transition: the inability, under a rule of law, to forgive theft. This can lead to the perpetuation of the non-rule-of-law state, even when it might seem that the alternative is Pareto-improving. Why do dysfunctional institutions persist? It is now well understood that they persist if there are politically powerful losers from reform and no way to promise them compensation credibly. There are two possible lines of attack on this problem. The first investigates whether the problem of commitment can be solved dynamically. The second asks how a society evolves when such commitment is not possible. We are concerned with the second question. The presumption has been that if a reform is Ôgood enoughÕ, then once a society understands the magnitude of its benefits, sufficient demand for the reform will emerge that it will occur. Creating the rule of law is an example of such a reform. The rule of law stops the few from stealing from the many. In this view, one would expect the rule of law to emerge. 1 Even though we believe that the rule of law creates a vast majority of winners, we see that many societies are not moving towards the rule of law. In Russia and many other post-communist countries, little progress towards either forming a strong constituency for the rule of law, or establishing the rule of law, has been made since the privatisation of most state enterprises. 2 Figure 1 presents the distribution, for the earliest and latest years available, of World Bank scores of adherence to the rule of law for 27 postcommunist countries and the world as a whole. 3 In 1996, the post-communist countries * We thank Mayuresh Kshetramade for outstanding research assistance.

Between 1996 and 2005, a twin peaks pattern emerged for the post-communist countries and for the world: some post-communist countries achieved a good measure of rule of law, while for the majority, scores remained low or deteriorated. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Holmes (2002)</ref> reflects a widely shared view (see fn. 2) when he writes that in Russia the central obstacle to the emergence of the rule of law is the lack of demand:</p><p>No well-organised constituency for a rule-of-law system exists in Russia today. Putin may sincerely want to introduce the rule of law. He may repeatedly announce that he is going to create it. . . .These subjective intentions are irrelevant, however. The rule of law is going to emerge only if there are strong constituencies supporting it. (p. 87) One possible explanation for this puzzle is that the rule of law is not such a great thing. Perhaps we have overestimated its ability to increase income or underestimated its distributional consequences, in particular, those that cannot be undone by credible commitments to redistribute. For example, the traditional view of the enclosure of the commons in England was that it created large, dispersed benefits. Yet <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Weitzman (1974)</ref> showed that most people could be worse off under the efficient enclosure than under inefficient free access rights. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> The establishment of the rule of law in a lawless state is a more compelling example of a reform that should engender widespread support, since it is a movement from the jungle to order. Political philosophers from Hobbes to Nozick clearly viewed this kind of reform as an improvement. Economists have argued that although private, relation-based governance may suffice for a middle-income country, the rule of law is necessary to make the transition to a high-income country <ref type="bibr">(Rodrik, 2003, p. 17;</ref><ref type="bibr">Dixit, 2004, p. 82</ref>). Yet, as <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> illustrates, many societies do not seem to be moving towards the rule of law.</p><p>In this article we offer an alternative explanation. We assume that the rule of law is an institutional change that permits higher levels of welfare to everyone because of the greater incentives to production. We also assume that individuals are forward-looking, with expectations that are consistent with the properties of the underlying model. But we allow individuals who do not believe that a quick transition to the rule of law will occur to adapt their economic activities accordingly. Costs of exiting the lawless state arise endogenously from these adaptive behaviours and engender resistance to reform.</p><p>We show this in a simple, dynamic model that builds on our earlier static model of coordination. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> In the earlier model, agents with control rights over enterprises face two choices: one economic, whether to build the value of their assets or strip them; and one political, whether to adopt the rule of law or not. Given the static nature of that model, only those who choose to build value benefit from the rule of law. Thus, the probability distribution of the political outcome depends on the fraction of the population that chooses to build value, which itself depends on the probability distribution of the political outcome. We showed that self-fulfilling Pareto-inferior equilbria may exist in which few agents build value and thus few demand the rule of law. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> [ A U G U S T 2008 ] 1475 E X I T I N G A L A W L E S S S T A T E <ref type="bibr">4</ref> Subsequently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Allen (1982)</ref> challenged the view that the enclosure movement enhanced efficiency. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> See <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Hoff and Stiglitz (2004a)</ref>, which also provides a brief review of the transition from communism in Russia. For a diagrammatic exposition, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Hoff and Stiglitz (2004b)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> For another example of political-economic links with self-fulfilling equilibria, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Chang (2006)</ref>.</p><p>In the dynamic setting that we explore here, all individuals obtain a future benefit from the establishment of the rule of law. Therefore, individuals who strip assets in the current period may vote for creating the rule of law. Their choice depends on the tradeoff between the loss from the expected recapture of part of their stripping income in the transition to the rule of law and the gain with respect to future economic activities.</p><p>Asset stripping in our model is like getting Ôblood on one's handsÕ, in that it makes an individual vulnerable to a loss in the transition to the rule of law. We do not assume that the blood is never washed away. On the contrary, we make the minimalist assumption that only the current period's return from asset stripping is vulnerable to recapture. However, as long as the non-rule-of-law state persists, some agents may choose to strip assets, period after period. Thus the blood on their hands would be fresh when the rule of law state was created and so they would gain from the establishment of the rule of law only after they began to build value -that is, with a time lag. 7 This can that delay the establishment of the rule of law or even lock the society out of it. Our results highlight a coordination problem that an elected policy maker cannot solve because of a commitment problem inherent in the rule of law.</p><p>All that we require to generate the possibility of losers from institutional reform endogenously is that, under the rule of law, society cannot commit itself to zero recapture of income from asset stripping. 8 This commitment problem arises from what scholars take to be key features of any system that provides impartial third party enforcement of property rights and contracts:</p><p>(a) Such a legal system should be viewed as a self-enforcing equilibrium between political officials and citizens, and</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">0 -2 0 2</formula><p>Rule of law score (b) Only if the distribution of power is such that conflicting actors seek to resolve their conflicts by recourse to law does law rule.</p><p>Following from these two properties is a third, namely, (c) The contents of the rule of law are subject to interrogation and reform, rather than capable of being frozen at a moment in time. 9</p><p>In other words, one cannot simultaneously have the rule of law and fence it in so as to commit a society not to capture illegitimate gains obtained before some time t. In Section 4, we sketch a simple mechanism underlying the commitment problem in a rule-of-law governed democracy: Politicians have incentives to appropriate illegitimately obtained income and to redistribute it to their supporters, whereas they do not have such incentives with respect to legitimately obtained income.</p><p>As in our earlier static model, we have chosen to develop our points in a specific context -post-communist countries after the privatisation of many state enterprises. But the framework of our article illuminates a very general problem and thus may serve as a basis for integrating the literature. Starting with a society in which theft is allowed but allowing theft is not in anyone's self-interest, can we explain the creation of third party enforcement of property rights, which makes it costly for individuals to steal? 10 Our framework shows why it is difficult to create a demand for the rule of law from scratch, e.g. without norms that limit theft. Our framework is Markov; i.e. current and future outcomes are conditioned only on the current state. If, more realistically, we allow that outcomes also depend on history, then the difficulty of exiting the lawless state after asset-stripping will be greater than our model would suggest, as we show in Section 2. In the conclusion, we suggest additional applications of our framework.</p><p>Our article contributes to the rapidly growing literature on the positive economics of institutional change (see references in fn. 1). Our departure from the existing work on the problem of credible commitment to compensate losers from reform is that we treat individualsÕ economic interests as endogenous, whereas existing work 11 treats them as parametric. That modelling approach is appropriate when economic institutions are stable with regard to the political transitions that the model tries to explain, e.g. the case of the transitions from authoritarianism of Latin America and Southern Europe <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(O'Donnell et al., 1986)</ref>. What is historically distinct about the post-communist transitions is the possibility of simultaneous deep change in both the economy and the polity. These transitions have been compared to Ôrebuilding the ship the seaÕ: ÔHardly any of the institutional elements of the old order can be relied upon, i.e., is considered. . .worthy of preservation for more than a transitory period or recognised as a worthy legacyÕ <ref type="bibr">(Elster et al., 1998, p. 18</ref>, emphasis in original). In this context it is appropriate to treat economic interests as endogenous. Our article focuses on the costs of exiting a lawless state created by two kinds of problems: (1) the coordination of 9 See, e.g. on (a) <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Weingast (1997)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Basu (2000)</ref> and on (b,c), <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Maravall and Przeworski (2003)</ref>. Regarding point (c), it is worthwhile to quote from the Supreme Court decision in the case of Nebbia vs. New <ref type="bibr">York (1934)</ref>, where the Court declared that Ôthere is no closed case or category of business affected with the public interest. . . <ref type="bibr">Õ (cited in North, 1981, p. 198)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">10 Basu (1997, p. 248)</ref> observes that ÔSince this exercise. . .has not been done thus far, we do not really know whether the model of the market, abstracted from its social and political moorings, can ever be realized.Õ</p><p>11 <ref type="bibr">As Acemoglu and Robinson (2006, p. 316)</ref> emphasise. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Acemoglu et al.

Our article also contributes to the literature on privatisation. Studies of privatisation all over the world have concluded that privatisation is unlikely to improve performance when corporate governance institutions are weak. <ref type="bibr">12</ref> While noting in that case the absence of any benefit from privatisation, these studies overlook a cost that we emphasise here: by widening the scope for asset stripping, privatisation may create political forces opposed to establishing the rule of law. Not surprisingly, scholars have enjoined developing countries before privatising firms to Ôembrace a corporate governance perspective. . .that can constrain the grabbing hands of public and private actorsÕ <ref type="bibr">(Dyck, 2001, p. 59)</ref>. In Section 3, we extend our model to consider two policies that affect the demand for the rule of law -the sequencing and pacing of the post-communist transition and macroeconomic policy.</p><p>Our framework of binary choices in the economy and the polity is too simple to capture the institutional path of any real post-communist country.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.">The Agents</head><p>There is a continuum one of forward-looking agents with control rights over enterprises. Time is divided into an infinite number of periods. In every period, each agent has a choice between two economic actions:</p><p>Building value: Making an irreversible investment to increase the enterprise's value, or Stripping assets: Stripping the assets of the enterprise by appropriating corporate value for themselves and expropriating minority investors, sometimes also referred to as ÔtunnellingÕ.</p><p>The assumption behind this setup is that agents are not constrained by norms, other informal institutions or corporate institutions such as boards. <ref type="bibr">13</ref> In choosing their strategies, agents look at the entire future stream of returns, where d 2 (0,1) is the discount factor.</p><p>Agents differ in their ability to strip assets. h denotes an agent's type, and a higher value of h corresponds to a greater ability to strip assets. h has a continuous distribution H(h) and density function h(AE).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2.">The Political Environment</head><p>There are two possible political institutions. Initially the polity is a Ônon-rule-of-law stateÕ. 14 The alternative political institution is Ôthe rule of lawÕ, by which we mean well-12 See <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Dyck (2001)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Djankov and Murrell (2002)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Megginson (2005)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">13</ref> For an interesting case study of the institutional vacuum in one Russian firm, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Gray and Hendley (1997)</ref>.</p><p>14 A typical characterisation of the institutional environment in which the first wave of Russian privatisation occurred was a Ôsystemic vacuum. . .[without] effective regulations and controlsÕ <ref type="bibr">(Kolodko, 2000, p. 196)</ref>, permitting Ôa sort of Hobbesian capitalismÕ <ref type="bibr">(Freeland 2000, p. 21)</ref>.</p><p>defined and enforced property rights, broad access to those rights and predictable rules for resolving rights disputes. The gain from the rule of law is that it makes property rights effective. We assume that for every agent, this is a gain: the profit incentives of a private firm under the rule of law are stronger than the rent-seeking incentives in the non-rule-of-law state (see inequality (4)). The question we address in this article is whether this assumption is sufficient to ensure a demand for establishing the rule of law.</p><p>In each period, individuals have to express a political preference, e.g. by voting over policies that would create the rule of law. Voting is a metaphor for the myriad ways, such as lobbying an elected policy maker, that individuals influence the collective choice over institutions. We assume that the probability p t of transition to the rule of law in period t is a decreasing function of the fraction of agents, denoted x t , who vote against the establishment of the rule of law:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">15 p t ¼ pðx t Þ; p 0 ðÁÞ &lt; 0 for x 2 ð0; 1Þ; 0 ¼ pð1Þ &lt; pð0Þ ¼ 1:<label>ð1Þ</label></formula><p>Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">1</ref>means that the probability that the rule of law will be established rises from zero to one as the proportion of agents opposed to its establishment falls from 100% to zero.</p><p>We also assume that the rule of law is an absorbing state: once it is established, the society continues in that state forever. Similar results would hold if there were a small probability of reversion to the non-rule-of-law state. 16</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3.">The Payoffs</head><p>For simplicity, we model the process of building the value of an asset as requiring a given level of investment. An individual who builds value in a period obtains an income flow f per unit asset and makes an investment I j &lt; f per unit asset, where j is the state of the world (N or L) at the end of the period, and I N &gt; I L . 17 One way to motivate this is to suppose that if N is the end-of-period state, then the firm must invest in the private enforcement of property rights to obtain a return on its investment.</p><p>Let b j denote the net flow from building value:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">b j ¼ f À I j for j ¼ N ; L:<label>ð2Þ</label></formula><p>Building value increases the asset to a proportiong &gt; 1 of its former size. We assume dg &lt; 1 so that asset values are finite.</p><p>The model makes an important simplification that leads to an underestimation of the value of the rule of law -the model abstracts from direct externalities across firms. In the real world, if a large fraction of the economy is engaged in asset stripping, then (as in Russia in the 1990s) overall production suffers. We abstract from these externalities in order to focus on externalities mediated by the political environment.</p><p>Consider next the payoff to stripping assets. An agent who strips will increase the flow of income per unit asset at the cost of reducing the asset to a proportionz &lt; 1 of its former size. Let s j denote the payoff per unit asset to an agent of type h, where j is the state of the world at the end of the period:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">s N ðhÞ ¼ h; s L ðh; kÞ ¼ ð1 À kÞh with k &gt; 0:<label>ð3Þ</label></formula><p>In this expression, k represents the diminution in the ability to strip after the imposition of the rule of law, which circumscribes certain actions used by strippers. k also measures the expected recapture of current income from stripping if the transition to the rule of law occurs in a given period. Thus, an agent of type h who is stripping assets suffers a loss hk in expected value in the transition period. This is his cost of exiting the lawless state.</p><p>As discussed above, we assume that for all agents, building value under the rule of law yields a higher lifetime utility than stripping assets under non-rule-of-law, i.e.</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">b L 1 À g ! h 1 À z<label>ð4Þ</label></formula><p>for all h and with strict inequality for some h, where g dg and z dz. One way to view the rule of law is that it suppresses the inferior, stripping technology -analogous to pulling a ship apart at sea -in favour of the superior, value-creating technologyrebuilding the ship. Below, we consider agentsÕ choice of economic strategy in the initial state N -that is, in the wreckage of the central planned economy.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.6.">The Stripping Ability Curve</head><p>To analyse the equilibrium demand (x) for the rule of law, one additional curve is needed that reflects the distribution of types in the population. We denote by the stripping ability curve the function x(h) ¼ 1 À H(h). For each value of h, the stripping ability curve gives the fraction of agents whose ability to strip is greater than or equal to that value. If the distribution of h is approximately normal, then the stripping ability curve will have the shape of the dotted line in <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>; another example is in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure  5</ref>(a).</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">1 0 III I x θ p (x;0) θ max θ a (x;0)</formula></div>

Since both curves are downward sloping, they can have more than one intersection. <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> depicts the case of two stable values of x Ã (at 0 and x 00 ). <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> also depicts an unstable equilibrium, at x 0 . At that point, the political switch line is steeper than the stripping ability curve. This means that the response along the political switch line to a perturbation in x will be greater than the perturbation itself. So if there is a perturbation at x 0 , the ÔswitchedÕ agents do not wish to switch back. The perturbation changes the way agents believe the system will evolve, which lowers h a by so much that some agents change their economic strategy and, having done that, face sufficiently high exit costs that their preference ordering over political institutions changes. Thus the path along which a fraction x 0 opposes the establishment of a rule of law in each period is unstable.</p><p>The model could have two corner solutions: x Ã ¼ 0 is always an equilibrium (though it need not be stable), since at x ¼ 0 the political switch line lies above, or is coincident with, the stripping ability curve. x Ã ¼ 1 is also an equilibrium if the political switch line lies 1 0</p><p>x' x'' below the stripping ability curve at x ¼ 1. If this point is an equilibrium, then the society is trapped in the non-rule-of-law state. <ref type="bibr">20</ref> The model clarifies the effect of changes in the expected recapture fraction, k. 21 A decrease in k makes asset stripping more attractive (the economic switch line shifts down) but also increases the demand for rule of law by asset strippers (the political switch line shifts up). The net effect on support for the establishment of the rule of law thus depends on the nature of the original equilibrium. Starting from a stable equilibrium in which the marginal ÔvoterÕ is a wealth-creator, 22 a reduction in k increases the opposition to the establishment of the rule of law, since it increases the fraction of agents who strip assets. However, starting from a stable equilibrium in which the marginal ÔvoterÕ is an asset stripper, the effect is the opposite: a reduction in k increases the demand for the rule of law, since it lowers exit costs from a lawless state.</p></div>

In our model, in contrast, the victims of the dysfunctional institutions include those who choose them. To illustrate this, we present a numerical example. In the example, we assume: (a) a transition probability equal to the squared demand for the rule of law: Figure 5(a) shows that the stable equilibria of x* are 0 and 0.75. In the first case, no one opposes the establishment of the rule of law, and reform occurs in period 1. In the second case, three-fourths of the agents oppose the rule of law, and reform is delayed on average for 16 periods. <ref type="bibr">24</ref>  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5</ref>(b) depicts the growth paths of agentsÕ expected aggregate lifetime income in these two cases. 25 Expected aggregate income is 20% lower along the path of delayed reform.

Consider a set of societies with initially similar distributions of types among which, for some reason, one subset began with an initially high level of asset stripping and another subset with an initially low level. If stripping assets was characterised by learning-by-doing, then behaviour would be self-reinforcing. The distribution of types would diverge over time, as would the degree of support for the rule of law. As <ref type="bibr">Holmes (2003, pp. 20-1)</ref> states,</p><p>Bullies and plunderers -who could never flourish if the rules of the game were crystal clear and reliably enforced -cannot be expected to promote or enforce a system that will radically devalue the rude skills of acquisition and domination they have perfected in the state of nature.</p><p>Efficiency in stripping may also increase as it becomes more institutionalised (and similarly, the ability to engage in growth-enhancing investments may increase with use, or atrophy without it). An offsetting factor would be that as the stock of assets goes down, the returns from further stripping decline. When assets to strip run out, everyone would support the rule of law. However, in natural resource-rich economies, such as Russia's, this would not happen quickly.</p><p>A further source of history dependence are labour adjustment costs if hired labour is specialised to either stripping assets or building value, e.g. mobsters vs. engineers.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">The Sequencing and Pacing of Reform</head><p>The model in Section 1 analysed how, after privatisation, asset-stripping affects the demand for the rule of law. Here we develop a very simple model that links what happens before and during formal privatisation -and what happens after. The extended model captures aspects of the debate in the 1990s between advocates of Ôgradualist policiesÕ and proponents of a ÔBig BangÕ approach to privatisation. (In the end, only Russia and the Czech Republic followed the latter approach.) A gradualist approach postpones privatisation until corporate governance institutions are in place, whereas a Big Bang, sometimes called Ôshock therapyÕ, privatises as rapidly as possible. <ref type="bibr">28</ref> At the outset of the transition from communism, a central rationale for rapid privatisation was to avoid the diminution of wealth within the state from asset stripping and inefficiency. Let Y G denote output per period from the initial stock of assets in the public sector. If wastage reduces the assets each period to a proportion l of their former size, and if the assets are privatised at time T, then the assets will have diminished by a factor l T .</p><p>Gradualism entails creating corporate governance mechanisms that reduce the ability of an agent to strip assets after privatisation. Such mechanisms shift down the stripping ability curve. <ref type="bibr">29</ref> We parameterise the shift by a function x(AE). The faster the privatisation, the weaker is corporate governance. <ref type="bibr">26</ref> The assassination in of V. Golovlyov, a member of the Duma, is one of a long list of assassinations, nearly all unsolved, of Russian public officials. It was believed that ÔMr. Golovlyov was killed by former cronies because he had jumped [from a criminal past] to the side of the law helping the investigators.Õ (Michael Wines, New York Times, August 24, 2002).</p><p>27 On the uses of political-economic models for posing normative questions with regard to aspects of policy that are treated as exogenous, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Rodrik (1993)</ref>. Besides the two policies considered in this Section, another key influence on the demand for rule of law are controls on international capital flows; see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Qian (1999)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Hoff and Stiglitz (2004a)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Braguinsky and Myerson (2007)</ref>.</p><p>28 This policy choice also has implications, which we do not discuss here, for the manner of privatisation (its perceived legality and the ability to transfer state enterprises to outsider, not insider, owners, with large consequences for privatisation's success) and also for employment losses and fiscal costs; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Roland (1994)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Dewatripont and Roland (1995)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Frydman et al.

First, delay means greater dissipation of value while assets remain in the public sector. But transferring property to the private sector does not eliminate agency problems. <ref type="bibr">30</ref> Strengthening corporate governance institutions increases the value of the assets in the hands of the private sector. A third set of effects relates to the political dynamics. Creating better corporate governance institutions before privatising large state enterprises reduces the incentives and scope for asset stripping and so influences the constituency for reform. Thus, if one plots social welfare in (19) as a function of the speed of privatisation, it may be that some delay in official privatisation trades off optimally the agency costs of state ownership with the agency costs and political risks (given weak corporate governance) of private ownership. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 6</ref> depicts this case.</p><p>But whether a comparison of gradualism and the Big Bang is a relevant comparison for Russia is contentious. In one view, no reform-minded government existed to ÔengineerÕ the transition. As the Russia historian Stephen <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Kotkin (2001)</ref> writes:</p><p>The idea that the collapse suddenly ended in December 1991 and that a handful of new ÔdemocratsÕ or Ôradical reformersÕ had come to power, was silly.

(p. 116, emphasis in original)</p><p>A second perspective is that Yeltsin enjoyed enormous authority in the autumn and winter of 1991-2. That authority gave him the opportunity to change the political forces in place before implementing privatisation. Had he made those changes, he could have <ref type="bibr">30</ref> In both the public and the private sectors, deadweight losses arise because information is asymmetric, incentives are not aligned and controllers take distortionary actions to divert assets and income from the ÔtrueÕ owner (the state or the corporation) to themselves <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Stiglitz, 2000)</ref>. Two recent developments shed light on the importance of agency costs in privatised firms in Russia: (a) A study finds that oligarchs who controlled state enterprises reported twice as much income as those who controlled private enterprises, Ôpresumably because it was more difficult to hide incomes in those businessesÕ <ref type="bibr">(Braguinsky, forthcoming)</ref>. The less income that is hidden, the less income that is likely diverted, with consequent deadweight losses. (b) One can interpret actions of Putin to limit the ability of privatised Russian firms to sell reserves of natural resources as reflecting his belief that this will reduce the diversion of assets (see The Russia Journal, ÔKremlin eyes Russia's natural resources,Õ Aug. <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr">2002</ref> repr. in Johnson's Russia List).</p><p>implemented gradualism. He chose not to do this and to focus instead on economic reforms first. <ref type="bibr">31</ref> A third view is that while gradualism was not politically feasible in Russia because it would have expropriated powerful stakeholders, Big Bang privatisation was both feasible and also favourable to the progress of Russia towards a free market economy because it would change the interests of the key political players. Fast privatisation, moreover, would constrain the policy options of future governments that might oppose capitalism <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Boycko et al., 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Shleifer and Treisman, 2000)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">32</ref> History cannot readily resolve counterfactual questions. However, Poland provides an example where advocates of Big Bang privatisation had argued that gradualism was not politically feasible but privatisation was delayed and wealth within the state was preserved (the rate of wastage l was low). Given Poland's success in preserving wealth and in moving towards the rule of law, 33 there is a strong presumption that Big Bang privatisation would have been inferior to the gradual privatisation strategy that Poland adopted. It is also plausible that Russia could have preserved a large fraction of its principal assets, natural resources, within the public sector: In extractive industries, one can at worst steal the flow. If the right to sell assets does not exist, no one can steal the capital value.</p></div>

We relax our assumption in (1) about the probability p(AE) of transition to the rule of law. We assume here that a particular typeĥ is decisive, as in the case of a median voter model, 34 so that we can direct attention at how policy affects him. We also assume thatĥ is sufficiently high that if an individual of typeĥ strips, he will oppose the establishment of the rule of law in the current period, i.e.ĥ &gt; h p . Thus, if he strips, p ¼ 0 and his utility is S N ðĥ; r Þ ¼ s N ðĥ; r Þ þ zS N ðĥ; r Þ, where r denotes the interest rate. If he builds value, then p ¼ 1 and his utility is V L (r) ¼ b L (r) þ gV L (r). Under plausible circumstances, raising r lowers the relative return to building value: at a higher value of r, the cost of capital is higher, the likelihood of credit rationing is greater and future profits obtained from current investments are more heavily discounted. <ref type="bibr">35</ref> Government chooses a level of public spending, G, and through monetary policy influences the level of the interest rate. <ref type="bibr">36</ref> The rule of law will be established if</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">s N ðĥ; r Þ 1 À z b L ðr Þ 1 À g : Rule-of -Law constraint<label>ð20Þ</label></formula><p>Equating the two sides of (20) implicitly defines a critical valuer .

In this Section, we explain why it may be neither desirable, nor feasible, to provide such a guarantee. It may actually be functional for society that some recapture of past theft is expected. A key limit on the extent of opportunistic behaviour in a lawless state is that such behaviours are punished under a future regime. If self-interested individuals perceived k to be zero, then, until the moment of the establishment of the rule of law, each would be trying to steal as much as he could. On such grounds, Adam <ref type="bibr">Smith (1759, Part II, ii, 3.</ref>3) argued that justice was necessary to the existence of society.</p><p>The sina qua non of the rule of law or any rule-governed state is the effective restriction on arbitrary power. Our article focuses on a limited range of theft -that of corporate assets. It is difficult to see how a society could commit itself to totally forgiving corporate theft (if its costs were viewed as high), while not doing so for other forms of theft. And the latter, both theory and history suggest a rule-governed state cannot do. 37 Instead of reviewing this vast literature, we suggest one mechanism that would make such a commitment impossible in a democracy.</p><p>The consequences of the state's seizing illegitimately taken property are markedly different from the consequences of the state's taking or redistributing legitimately obtained wealth. It is rational for politicians seeking to increase their share of the electorate to argue for the first and not the second and for redistributing the illegitimately obtained wealth to voters. Nationalising stolen wealth does not harm investment incentives. On the contrary, it improves them.  37 See fn. 9 and <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Elster (2004)</ref>, who finds that attempts to design institutions to protect once politically powerful groups from justice under successor regimes have never succeeded.

At the beginning of the transition, not everyone believed that privatisation and the creation of a market economy would, at least by themselves, improve the well-being of most citizens. Support for the Coasian position that, in the absence of transaction costs, any distribution of property rights under a rule of law is efficient and therefore should be respected, depends on the fact that it actually does lead to efficient outcomes. There is an equilibrium in which this is not believed and justifiably so, because it does not produce the promised results if it is not believed. Distrust in this proposition undermines the legitimacy of rights directly and, indirectly, weakens property rights through the mechanism outlined in our model, by undermining the demand for the rule of law. Our article has investigated this type of coordination failure and the Ôexit costsÕ from a non-rule-of-law state to which the coordination failure gives rise.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Avenues for Future Research</head><p>Our model leaves open a wide range of problems for future work:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">The Evolution of Inequality</head><p>As is well known, in Russia many of the asset-strippers evolved into oligarchs and the loans-for-shares programme in 1995-7 consolidated the oligarchic structure of power. The dysfunctional institutions in Russia led to a vast increase in inequality of wealth and power; an interesting discussion is <ref type="bibr">Colloudon (2002)</ref>. This development lies completely outside our model. Moreover, as economic historians have established, high inequality is itself a key factor in the creation and persistence of dysfunctional institutions; see e.g. <ref type="bibr">Sokoloff (1997, 2003)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Acemoglu et al. (2002)</ref>. An important problem for future research is thus to incorporate the modelling of changes in inequality with that of changes in institutions. This should shed further light on why attempts to jumpstart capitalist institutions are hazardous.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Bayesian Dynamics</head><p>Not only do we see that the distribution of power coevolves with institutions. A similar process occurs with respect to beliefs. In the post-communist countries, individuals update their beliefs about whether privatisation leads to efficiency on the basis of the economic outcomes of the privatisation and also the incentives of the advocates of particular positions. The fact that short-run outcomes were so poor in many of the postcommunist economies and that those advocating rapid privatisation enriched themselves by it so greatly, 39 would increase doubts about the validity of the view that a market economy is broadly beneficial <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Denisova et al., 2007)</ref>. An analysis of the Bayesian dynamics, in which agents update their beliefs about the truth of the Coasian view, might help to explain differences across countries in the paths of institutional development.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.">International Policy as a Coordination Device</head><p>We have explored the role of national policies (e.g. macroeconomic policy) in limiting the economic behaviour that can reinforce bad institutions. What role can international organisations, such as the World Trade Organisation, play in facilitating coordination? In the case of the Eastern European countries, the opportunity to join the European Union made a particular set of rules focal and led individuals to anticipate large rewards from coordinating on them, which helps to explain the successful transitions in those economies; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Elster et al. (1998)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Roland and Verdier (2003)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4.">Other Applications of the Model</head><p>We have focused on the transition from communism but our analysis has three other applications. Without change, the model can be applied to the problem of post-conflict states in which economic and political structures have collapsed. A second application is to post-colonial countries in which the legitimacy of inherited law is contested. To those currently in possession of assets, there is a risk that another claimant to the property will appear and have the backing of law. This lowers the relative return to investing (relative to asset stripping). Stripping affects the political dynamics. It creates an additional obstacle to the movement towards the rule of law based on any conceivable criteria of legitimacy of property rights.</p><p>A third application is to oil field unitisation. Imagine that a number of individuals own an oil reservoir in common; that is, none has the right to exclude any of the others. Overexploitation makes extraction inefficient for each individual by prematurely depleting subsurface pressure. But because no one pays for the use of the field, no one takes this cost fully into account in deciding how to exploit the field. The problem disappears if one individual owns the whole field and charges each individual for his use <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Libecap 1989)</ref>. However, anticipation of delay in unitisation leads to individual drilling. Imagine that every period of individual drilling gives a leaseholder private information about the value of his lease. Then he may gain from a delay in unitisation if his private information is favourable. Delay, by making the information public and so increasing his rental share under unitisation, offsets the impact on him</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Distribution of World Bank Rule of Law Scores for Post-communist Countries and AllCountries, 1996 and Note.

A premise of the analysis is that those who do are the decisive ÔvotersÕ over whether to create impartial third-party enforcement of property rights and contracts.16 It would be easy to model such a reversion within our Markovian framework, and it is clear from Figure 1 that reversion occurs. Our assumption of no reversion increases the gains from transition to the rule of law and, thus, makes it more surprising that a strong demand for rule of law may not emerge.17 Alternatively, as in<ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Hoff and Stiglitz (2004a)</ref>, we could model the rule of law as entailing an increased return from the same level of investment -e.g. because it reduces the costs of distribution.
