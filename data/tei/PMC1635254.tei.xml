			<abstract>
				<p>We describe an optimized microarray method for identifying genome-wide CpG island methylation called microarray-based methylation assessment of single samples (MMASS) which directly compares methylated to unmethylated sequences within a single sample. To improve previous methods we used bioinformatic analysis to predict an optimized combination of methylation-sensitive enzymes that had the highest utility for CpG-island probes and different methods to produce unmethylated representations of test DNA for more sensitive detection of differential methylation by hybridization. Subtraction or methylation-dependent digestion with McrBC was used with optimized (MMASS-v2) or previously described (MMASS-v1, MMASS-sub) methylationsensitive enzyme combinations and compared with a published McrBC method. Comparison was performed using DNA from the cell line HCT116. We show that the distribution of methylation microarray data is inherently skewed and requires exogenous spiked controls for normalization and that analysis of digestion of methylated and unmethylated control sequences together with linear fit models of replicate data showed superior statistical power for the MMASS-v2 method. Comparison with previous methylation data for HCT116 and validation of CpG islands from PXMP4, SFRP2, DCC, RARB and TSEN2 confirmed the accuracy of MMASS-v2 results. The MMASS-v2 method offers improved sensitivity and statistical power for high-throughput microarray identification of differential methylation.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>Epigenetic changes are heritable changes that include reversible covalent modifications of histone proteins and methylation of DNA. The vast majority of mammalian DNA methylation is located at the cytosine of CpG dinucleotides which are particularly frequent within CpG islands. The definition of a CpG island continues to evolve but the following criteria are currently accepted (1): a length &gt;500 bp, G + C content &gt;50% and CpG dinucleotides at an observedto-expected ratio &gt;0.60. Approximately 70% of mammalian genomic CpG dinucleotides are methylated and commonly occur within repetitive elements <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref>. In contrast, most unmethylated CpG islands span the promoter regions of house-keeping genes and tumour suppressor genes and are critical in gene expression regulation and cell differentiation <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref>.</p><p>The number of cancer-related genes inactivated by epigenetic modifications may equal or exceed the number inactivated by genetic mutations or allele loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>. Therefore, the development of high-throughput methods to characterize methylated and unmethylated CpG islands in normal and neoplastic tissues is vital to enable discovery of methylation markers for cancer predisposition as well as understanding the role of DNA methylation in neoplastic progression and drug resistance <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>.</p><p>Differential methylation hybridization (DMH) is an arraybased method for comparing the methylation status of CpG islands between test samples and a common reference <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>. The two DNAs are first digested with MseI to reduce the size of genomic fragments followed by a combination of methylation-sensitive enzymes that only restrict unmethylated recognition sequences. The MseI recognition sequence (TTAA) is found frequently within bulk DNA, but is rarely found within CpG islands which remain intact after digestion <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref>. Subsequent linker-mediated PCR results in amplicons that are enriched for methylated sequences. The labelled amplicons are competitively hybridized and the ratio of test to reference signal intensities at each probe on the array reflects methylation differences between the two samples. Nouzova et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref> modified this method by using digestion with a methylation-dependent enzyme, the homing endonuclease McrBC. This enzyme has a degenerate methylation recognition sequence that only cleaves methylated DNA and is very frequent in CpG islands. Amplicons from digested DNA therefore represent unmethylated sequences, and competitive hybridization of amplicons from McrBC digested and undigested DNA from the same sample was used to identify methylated sequences by within-sample comparison. This avoided the need for a common reference design which is advantageous for profiling clinical samples where no appropriate reference tissue may be available or where the available reference sample may not have a 'normal' methylation pattern. However, a potential disadvantage of the Nouzova et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref> method is that there is unequal representation of methylated and unmethylated sequences in a single hybridization and this may reduce sensitivity to detect differential methylation.</p><p>Previous DMH profiling studies used microarrays for which the full sequences of the probes, and consequently their restriction map sites, were unknown <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>. This prevented rational design of the digestion steps and rigorous analysis of probe performance to exclude artefactual errors <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref>. For example, if a probe sequence lacks the restriction site for a methylation-sensitive enzyme that digests unmethylated target, the signal from this probe will be falsely assigned as methylated. In this work, we used bioinformatic tools to provide detailed annotation of all probes on a publicly available CpG island array and used this information to develop and validate a high-throughput method called microarray methylation assessment of a single sample (MMASS). We show that MMASS offers improved sensitivity to profile methylated as well as unmethylated CpG islands from single samples.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cell line</head><p>HCT116 colon cancer cells were cultured in McCoy's 5A modified medium supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. High-molecular weight DNA was isolated using standard proteinase K and phenol extraction methods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Derivation of probe sequences and preparation of spike control DNA</head><p>Human CpG island arrays containing 13 056 features (HCGI12K) were obtained from the Microarray Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Canada (http:// www.microarrays.ca/products/types.html#HCGI12K). End sequences for the CpG island probes were obtained from the Sanger Centre (available from http://www.sanger.ac.uk/ HGP/cgi.shtml) and aligned by BLAST <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref> against the NCBI v.35 human genome assembly. Each probe sequence was predicted from contiguous sequence tag alignments containing two MseI recognition sites as MseI digestion was used to create the CpG island library <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref>. Sequences were further annotated with PERL scripts using BioPerl libraries <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref> together with data and libraries from Ensemble (22) (Supplementary <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> and Supplementary Perl scripts 1-3). Repetitive sequences were identified using repeatmasker (http://www.repeatmasker.org).</p><p>Spike control amplicons were prepared by PCR from DNA extracted from normal blood. Methylated spikes were methylated in vitro using SssI (New England Biolabs) following the manufacturer's instructions and methylation was confirmed by digestion with appropriate methylation-sensitive enzymes and gel electrophoresis. Methylated and unmethylated spikes were added to the samples before MseI digestion at concentrations corresponding to 1-1000 copies (Supplementary <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preparation of genomic DNA</head><p>Genomic representation of methylated and unmethylated sequences by enzyme digestion. The MMASS-v1 and MMASS-v2 methods used methylation-sensitive and methylation-dependent enzyme digestion for within-sample comparison ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>). Genomic DNA (2 mg for MMASS-v1 and 1.2 mg for MMASS-v2 methods) was digested overnight in a 30 ml volume using 20 U MseI at 37 C. Digested DNA was then ligated to the linkers H-14 5 0 -tactccctcggata-3 0 and H-24 5 0 -aggcaactgtgctatccgagggag-3 0 which prevented reconstitution of the MseI site. Ligation was carried out in a mixture comprising 30 ml MseI digested DNA, 16 mM annealed linkers, 10• ligase buffer, 1.5 ml of 10 mM ATP, 6 ml PEG 6000, 400 U T4 DNA ligase and 10 U MseI in a total volume of 60 ml at 20 C for 4 h. The ligated DNA fragments were purified using the Qiaquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen), eluted in 100 ml water and vacuum dried. For representation of unmethylated sequences, half the sample was restricted with McrBC, after resuspension in 40 ml water with 10• NEB buffer 2, 10• GTP, 10• BSA and 20 U McrBC at 37 C for 4 h. For representation of methylated sequences, the other half of the sample was restricted by either the combination of BstUI, HhaI and HpaII (MMASS-v1) in a volume of 30 ml (17) or the combination of AciI, HinP1I, HpyCH4IV and HpaII (MMASS-v2) in a volume of 70 ml with 10• NEB buffer 1, 10• BSA and 20 U of each of the enzymes. A further 10 U of each enzyme was added after 4 h for the MMASS-v2 method and the reaction was allowed to continue for a further 2 h.</p><p>Genomic representation of unmethylated sequences by subtraction. The MMASS-sub method used subtractive hybridization to obtain the unmethylated representation from the starting DNA ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>). Amplicons representing methylated CpG islands were prepared using the MMASS-v1 method as above by digesting 2 mg of DNA and using both halves for methylation-sensitive enzyme digestion. One amplicon was then used as the subtractor DNA from an additional 1 mg of the test DNA digested with MseI. Subtraction was performed using biotin-labelling (BioNick Labeling System; Invitrogen) of the subtracter DNA and recovery with streptavidin-coated magnetic particles (Streptavidin Magnetic Particles; Roche Diagnostics) following the manufacturer's recommendations and as described previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref>. The resulting subtracted DNA (unmethylated representation) was then amplified as below before being hybridized against the remaining methylated amplicon.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Representation using Nouzova method</head><p>The Nouzova et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref> method was carried using both indirect labelling (see below) and as described previously using direct incorporation of Cy3-or Cy5-labelled dCTP and cohybridization with Cot-1 DNA.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PCR amplification</head><p>Each restricted DNA sample was purified using a Qiaquick PCR purification column (Qiagen) and eluted in 100 ml water. PCR amplification was performed in a 300 ml volume comprising 100 ml digested DNA, 10• thermo-start buffer (Applied Biosystems), 100 mM MgCl, 25% DMSO, 200 mM Betaine (Sigma), 0.5 mM H-24 primer, 0.1 mM dNTP mixture and 6 U Deep Vent R (exo À ) DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs). The thermocycling conditions were 5 min at 72 C to fill in the overhanging ends of the ligated DNA fragments, followed by 21 cycles (25 cycles for the MMASS-v2 method) of 1 min at 94 C, 1 min at 65 C and 3 min at 72 C, with a final extension for 10 min at 72 C. Five microlitres of the PCR product was electrophoresed on a 1.5% agarose gel and a diffuse smear pattern between 0.2 and 2kb was taken to indicate successful PCR amplification as described previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Labelling and hybridization</head><p>For each methylated and unmethylated amplicon 300 ng of PCR product was vacuum dried and resuspended in 33 ml of water with 2.5• random primer buffer (BioPrime Labeling Kit; Invitrogen) together with 0.5 ng of control Arabidopsis thaliana cDNA (synthesized from pARAB obtained from the Microarray Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Canada) and denatured at 95 C for 5 min. Each denatured sample was placed on ice with 7.5 ml of 10• dNTP mixture (2 mM each of dATP, dCTP and dGTP, and 0.35 mM dTTP), 1.8 ml of 10 mM aminoallyl-dUTP together with 80 U Klenow Fragment and incubated at 37 C for 2 h then stopped with 5 ml of stop buffer (BioPrime Kit). The total volume was increased to 425 ml with water and unincorporated aminoallyl-dUTP was removed by two centrifugations at 10 000 r.p.m. using a Microcon YM30 concentrator (Millipore). Purified sample was collected by centrifuging the inverted column at 4500 r.p.m. for 5 min and then vacuum dried. Each sample was reconstituted in 4.5 ml of water together with 4.5 ml Cy dye (Amersham-Pharmacia Biotech)  in 0.1M sodium bicarbonate titrated with sodium hydroxide to pH 9.0. The mixture was held at room temperature in the dark for 1.5 h and the coupling reaction was stopped by adding 4.5 ml of 4M hydroxylamine and 35 ml of 100 mM sodium acetate (pH 5.2). Labelled DNA was purified using a Qiaquick PCR purification column and then vacuum dried. Both dye-coupled DNAs were then resuspended together in 85 ml of DIG Easy Hyb solution (Roche Diagnostics) together with 5 ml of salmon sperm DNA (10 mg/ml) and denatured at 95 C for 5 min. The hybridization mixture was allowed to cool briefly and 5 ml of yeast tRNA (10 mg/ml) was added and the mixture was held at 65 C for 2 min and allowed to cool to room temperature. Hybridization to the microarray was carried out under a cover slip in a humidified chamber at 37 C for 8 h. The cover slip was floated off in 1• SSC and each slide was washed three times in 1• SSC and 0.1% SDS at 50 C for 15 min followed by removal of SDS at room temperature in 1• SSC and 0.1• SSC for 5 min each. The slides were dried by centrifugation at 500 r.p.m. for 5 min and scanned immediately using the GenePix 4000A scanner (Axon). The settings for PMT gain were adjusted during the initial rapid scan to achieve a balance between the two channels and these settings were used for the high resolution scan. GenePix version 4.1 was used to perform image analysis and feature segmentation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>COBRA</head><p>Sodium bisulphite conversion of HCT116 DNA was performed as described previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25)</ref>. PCR was then performed on bisulphite-modified DNA samples using primers designed to amplify both methylated and unmethylated DNA (Supplementary <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>). This was followed by restriction digestion using appropriate enzymes that contain CpG within their recognition sequence as these will change in the DNA samples if the original cytosine bases were unmethylated and followed by quantification using electrophoresis on a 2.5% agarose gel.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Microarray analysis</head><p>The limma (26) package within the R environment (27) was used to background-correct, normalize and analyse the data. Where the background exceeded the foreground intensity, the minimum background value for the array was subtracted rather than the local background measurement of the spot. We combined replicate dye-swap arrays for each method using the linear model and empirical Bayes smoothing procedures available in the limma package. A full transcript of all statistical code and the results of computations are provided in the Supplementary Sweave document which allows the analysis to be examined and repeated exactly <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref>. The raw data from the array experiments is available from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO; www.ncbi.nlm.nih. gov/geo) under the series accession number GSE5326.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Calculation of spike statistics</head><p>For each spiked probe we obtained the spike, digestion and non-digestion effect statistics which represented the spike amount (compared to background level) and the amount of the spike that was digested and undigested, respectively. The spike effect was estimated from the difference in log-intensities between the spiked and unspiked experiments.</p><p>For the comparisons between labelling methods, intensities were obtained from the channel in which the spike was not expected to be digested and averaged between arrays. The digestion effect was defined as the difference in log-ratios between the spiked (M 0 ) and non-spiked (M) arrays for methylated (</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">D m i ¼ M M 0 i À M M i ) and unmethylated (D u i ¼ M M i À M M 0 i ) spiked probes (i), respectively.</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis of probe sequences</head><p>We first used bioinformatic methods to predict the complete sequence for all probes on the CpG island arrays, as at the start of the project only end-sequence tags were available <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref>.  <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>). From these analyses, we found that 4160 out of 5435 (76.5%) of the probes on the CpG array would be informative when using the previously described combination of BstUI, HpaII and HhaI enzymes to generated representations of methylated target DNA <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>. We predicted that using a novel combination of four enzymes (AciI, HpaII, HinP1I and HpyCH4IV) would utilize 4403 out of 5435 (81%) of the array probes and therefore improve utility. In addition this combination of enzymes was more convenient as all four enzymes could digest efficiently in the same buffer. In contrast, digestion with BstUI, HpaII and HhaI required a two-step digestion protocol with an additional purification step.</p><p>We hypothesized that the sensitivity of array-based methylation detection could be improved if greater contrast could be achieved between methylated and unmethylated signal. We therefore evaluated two different methods for generating representations of unmethylated sequences. First, we used McrBC to digest methylated DNA in one-half of the sample for comparison against digestion with the combinations of methylation-sensitive enzymes above (MMASS-v1 and MMASS-v2; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>). Second, we used subtractive hybridization using a subtractor DNA digested with BstUI, HpaII and HhaI (MMASS-sub; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Exploratory data analysis</head><p>For each of the methods we obtained four microarray hybridizations, using replicate biological preparations in a balanced dye-swap design and compared the results to the method of Nouzova et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref>. DNA from the colorectal cancer cell line HCT116 was used for all experiments as methylation patterns have been well characterized in this cell line <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32)</ref>.</p><p>The overall quality of individual hybridizations was assessed by inspection of MA and spatial plots (33) for each of the arrays <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 2</ref> and Supplementary Sweave document). Unsatisfactory array experiments were repeated and 16 high-quality hybridizations were obtained from a total of 19 experiments.</p><p>Log ratios (M) for control A.thaliana probes showed little variation around M ¼ 0 indicating high reproducibility ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>). Inspection of blank spots showed uniform low intensities as expected <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 2)</ref>. In contrast to MA plots from expression array and array CGH experiments, the distribution of log-ratios from MMASS and Nouzova experiments was not symmetrical. It is important to note that for the Nouzova et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref> method the log-ratios should theoretically all be positive, as a mixture of methylated and unmethylated sequences was directly compared to unmethylated sequences. Comparison between arrays showed that each method had a characteristic distribution of data points on the MA plot that was highly consistent between replicate experiments. For the MMASS-v2 and the MMASS-sub methods there was a bimodal distribution of log-ratios at higher probe intensities <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figures 2 and 3)</ref> indicating increased separation between methylated and unmethylated sequences.</p><p>We evaluated different strategies for optimum normalization of each method and these are discussed in detail in the Supplementary Sweave document. The A.thaliana probes proved unreliable for location normalization except for the MMASS-v2 method where pipetting error was well controlled, allowing the use of median correction (Supplementary <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure S1</ref>). Replicate arrays for the MMASS-v1 and Nouzova methods were sufficiently comparable after global loess normalization. For the MMASS-sub method, normalization was performed using a subset of high-intensity methylated clones that demonstrated consistent log-ratios between replicate arrays (Supplementary <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure S2)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Identification of differentially methylated probes</head><p>For each of the methods we fitted a linear model followed by empirical Bayes smoothing to obtain B statistics <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34)</ref> so that probes could be ranked by the likelihood of differential methylation. Volcano plots summarizing the results showed striking differences in the B statistics obtained from each method <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Figure 3</ref>). Most notably, the Nouzova method gave a very low and limited range of B statistics demonstrating a lack of power to assess methylation. In contrast, the MMASS-v2 and MMASS-sub methods resulted in much higher B values indicating better assessment of methylation. However, compared to the MMASS-v2 method, the MMASS-sub method was more variable as shown by the wide spread of points with low B values in the MMASSsub method volcano plot <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Figure 3)</ref>. The MMASS-v2 method resulted in markedly higher B values than the MMASS-v1 method. The poor discrimination of the Nouzova data was surprising. To exclude artefact caused by our use of indirect labelling or different hybridization conditions, we repeated the original protocol exactly as described for four additional arrays. No significant increase in performance was obtained by using the unmodified protocol (Supplementary Sweave document).</p><p>We next examined results for mitochondrial DNA and repetitive element probes as these are known to be substantially unmethylated and methylated, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(36)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(37)</ref>. The MA plots showed the mitochondrial DNA to be consistently unmethylated in data from the MMASS methods ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>). However the Nouzova et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref> method had poor sensitivity for distinguishing unmethylated mitochondrial genes. Ranking by B statistics showed that the top unmethylated probes were mitochondrial DNA sequences and that the most methylated probes were repeat elements <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Figure 4</ref>). It is important to note that as mitochondrial and repetitive sequences are present in high copy number in the genome <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(36)</ref> and over-represented on the HCG12K arrays (see earlier), more consistent probe measurements would be expected, making it easier to detect differential methylation for these probes as compared to single copy genes.</p><p>We then assessed the effect of spiking in vitro methylated and unmethylated target DNAs into the hybridization samples as positive and negative controls for the detection of methylated and unmethylated sequences. We first labelled 32 candidate spikes and hybridized them to two HCGI12K arrays to test the stringency of hybridization (Supplementary <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure  S3)</ref>. Eight spikes which showed correct hybridization and had the largest spike effects (Supplementary <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure S4)</ref> were selected for further analysis. Adequacy of in vitro methylation was confirmed with BstUI digestion (Supplementary <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure S5</ref>) and spikes that were poorly methylated or that had inconsistencies between predicted and actual DNA sequence were excluded from analysis. The spikes were added to two hybridizations for each method leaving the remaining two unspiked so that background measurements for spiked probes could be established.</p><p>To quantify the amount by which the spikes were digested, we calculated the spike effect at each of the four methylated and unmethylated spiked probes and compared this to the spike remaining after digestion ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5</ref> and Supplementary <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure S4</ref>). For unmethylated spikes, the largest spike effect was seen for probes shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5g</ref> and h where almost complete digestion by the MMASS-v1 and MMASS-v2 methods was observed. As expected there was minimal digestion by the Nouzova et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref> method as McrBC does not restrict unmethylated sequences. The spike effect at probes shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5</ref> e and f was too small to allow meaningful interpretation. For methylated spikes <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Figure 5a-d</ref>) the largest digestion effect was observed for the MMASS-sub  <ref type="table">Supplementary Table 3.</ref> and MMASS-v2 method. However the subtraction process could also have attenuated the spiked sequences, increasing the apparent effect. There was little digestion effect seen for the Nouzova <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref> and MMASS-v1 methods.</p><p>To validate the results for single copy genes, we selected 14 probes randomly within low, medium and high average probe intensity (A) ranges and compared results from array hybridizations from each MMASS method with independent assessment by COBRA <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Figure 3, Supplementary Figure S6</ref> and <ref type="table">Supplementary Table 3</ref>). Although COBRA only surveys two to four CpGs in an amplicon, our experience in cancer samples is that this gives a good indication of the methylation status of the locus. Results from probes with A values higher than the median intensity of the A.thaliana control spots were more consistent with the COBRA results and these higher intensity probes were also more consistent across all MMASS methods <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Figure 3</ref> and <ref type="table">Supplementary  Table 3</ref>).</p><p>The MMASS-sub method resulted in greatest separation between the methylated and unmethylated COBRA validated clones <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Figure 3)</ref>. The ranking of the MMASS probes by degree of methylation was consistent with full and partial methylation results detected by COBRA <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Figure 3</ref> and <ref type="table">Supplementary Table 3</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Validation of methylation of cancer-related genes</head><p>We then examined 325 single copy probes identified by the MMASS-v2 method with values of B &gt; À3 as this cutoff was consistent with the COBRA validation experiments  (Supplementary <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>). From these, 22 were selected that were proximal to genes reported previously as having cancerrelated functions ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 6</ref>), including DNA replication and repair (PMS2L4, MCM7 and BRCA1) and tumour suppressor function in colorectal cancer (SFRP2) <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(38)</ref>. Validation of the methylation status of five CpG islands (PXMP4, SFRP2, DCC, RARB and the unmethylated housekeeping gene TSEN2) confirmed correct array results using COBRA or MSP (Supplementary <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure S7)</ref>. Our array result for HNRPA2B1 ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 6</ref>) was not in agreement with previous data that has shown it to be unmethylated in HCT116 (39) but we were unable to obtain a satisfactory MSP result to confirm this (data not shown). The reproducibility of the MMASS-v2 method was also demonstrated by the finding of very similar B values for several duplicate probes from single copy genes, including MCM7 ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 6</ref> and Supplementary <ref type="figure">Figure S8</ref>). We also examined array data from 23 probes representing 9 genes (SYK, ZFP37, DIRAS3, RARB, LMX1A, DAPK1, SFRP2, FAT and RASSF1) that have been reported previously to be methylated in HCT116 <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40)</ref>. Inspection of MA and volcano plots for each of the four methods ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 7)</ref> showed that the MMASS-v2 results were most consistent with previous data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>Genomic profiling of methylated and unmethylated sequences using methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme digestion and hybridization to microarrays is a potentially powerful and convenient technique. However, in contrast to work carried out on expression microarray data, no detailed assessment of the effects of different protocols or analysis methods has been performed <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42)</ref>. We have developed and optimized new restriction enzyme methods to profile both methylated and unmethylated sequences within a single sample.</p><p>The three MMASS methods resulted in very consistent data representation between replicate experiments but there were marked differences in sensitivity. The MMASS-sub method increased the power to resolve methylation differences as compared to the previously published Nouzova et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref> method, but also increased noise <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Figure 3</ref>). The subtraction steps were time consuming, and there remains a theoretical disadvantage that the subtraction may compound errors caused by partial digestion. For example, an excess of the partially digested sequences in the subtracter DNA amplicon could result in disproportionate removal of target DNA and a skewed representation of methylation. The MMASS-v2 method resulted in better representation of the methylation status of the target DNA ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 7</ref>) and had less noise, and therefore increased power, as compared to other methods <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Figures 3 and 7)</ref>. This may be in part because of better digestion of unmethylated sequences ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5</ref>). As additional fresh enzymes were added in the MMASS-v2 method and digestion was carried out in a single step using one buffer-enzyme combination, minimizing potential loss of sample.</p><p>The poor performance of the Nouzova et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref> method was surprising and cannot be explained simply by technical reasons, such as failure of McrBC digestion, as all experiments were carried out using the same conditions, batch of enzyme and in vitro methylated spikes. In addition, the dynamic range for probe data was very similar between our Nouzova experiments and the original publication. It is possible that other effects such as array quality or the higher genomic complexity of the amplicon from the undigested DNA (containing unmethylated and methylated sequences) may have altered spike-probe hybridization results. However in contrast to MMASS, the Nouzova method has very poor sensitivity for detecting hypomethylation <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 2</ref>) such as mitochondrial spots. The mixtures being compared by hybridization may have had strong effects on sensitivity. The direct comparison of methylated to unmethylated representations appears more sensitive (larger M values) than comparisons to a mixture of methylated and unmethylated sequences as in the Nouzova et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref> method. The MMASS methods resolved with high precision the methylation status for repetitive and mitochondrial target DNAs as these are represented in high copy number in the genome <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Figure 4)</ref>. They also were able to resolve single copy CpG methylation and identify correctly the methylation status of a number of CpG islands which have been described previously to be methylated or unmethylated in HCT116 <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">(Figures 6 and 7)</ref>.</p><p>The bioinformatic analysis of methylation array data is very different to that of expression data in which symmetrical distribution of log-ratios is assumed and the main aim of normalization is to remove dye bias. We show here that data distributions from different methods are inherently skewed and may be bi-modal at high intensities. It is not possible to estimate how much asymmetry to expect since this will depend upon the method used and global levels of methylation in the samples. We have carefully investigated and applied appropriate methods for these analyses. From these data it is clear that proper normalization is fundamentally reliant on exogenous controls including the spiked A.thaliana cDNA used here, but better reagents are needed. Significant collaborative efforts are now underway for designing reproducible control spikes for expression studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(43)</ref>. It is important to note that use of simplistic locationbased normalization in other datasets is likely to have prevented detection of real effects and combining probe-level data between different datasets that have used different methods and comparator DNAs may be impossible to achieve.</p><p>We were able to optimize our methods by using bioinformatic tools to identify and annotate the predicted probe sequences on the HCGI12K array and to identify the optimum set of restriction enzyme sites to maximize probe utilization. Optimization of this enzyme set was based on analysis of 5435 CpG island sequences and therefore likely to be of high utility to other CpG island platforms. This may also have contributed to the improved effects seen with the MMASS-v2 method. However, our analysis was limited by the low number of informative probes caused by inclusion of repeat and nonsense sequences from the original library. Improved array platforms with better representation of all CpG islands across the genome, as well as fine mapping within individual CpG islands, are now needed for detailed studies.</p><p>MMASS has several advantages over current highthroughput methods; e.g. MMASS in common with DMH employs a universal primer complementary to the ligated adaptor rather than a complex sequence-specific primer <ref type="table">TSEN2  FOXD4L1  PCDH11X  PMS2L4  MCM7  MCM7  HECA  BRIP1  HSPA2  PXMP4  IKIP  HNRPA2B1  BRCA1  CACYBP  SFRP2  TUSC4  TES  PGD  DCC  RARB  GATA4  MMP2  CTMP  ING4</ref>  design such as in methylation-specific oligonucleotide microarray <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(44)</ref> and MALDI mass spectrometry <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(45)</ref>. Methylation analysis using BAC microarrays requires the use of rare cutting methylation-sensitive enzymes which limits resolution to a single BAC probe, or only provides an average estimate of methylation across a large genomic region <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47)</ref>. Other methods that have used within-sample comparison methylation analysis have either used non-optimized enzyme combinations <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(48)</ref> or complex specific linker/enzyme pairings that have not been shown to improve sensitivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(49)</ref>. MMASS is able to resolve the overall methylation status of a single copy CpG island probe on a spectrum from mostly unmethylated to mostly methylated. Our results also show that in contrast to DMH and the Nouzova et al. (19) method, we were able to detect unmethylated sequences such as housekeeping genes ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 6</ref>). This will be particularly important in the context of the human epigenome project and for cancer studies where comparison is needed for both methylated and unmethylated sequences (50). </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>MMASS method.
