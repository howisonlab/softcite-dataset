			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="2">One recruiting chair confi dentially admitted that in 2005 by the time the fi rst half of the applications had been read, his committee found enough acceptable applicants to fi ll all the school's January interview slots. The remaining applications, of which there were several hundred, went unread.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="3">For a theoretical exploration of the gains from signaling in a job matching context, useful starting points are<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Coles, Kushnir, and Niederle (2009)</ref>, Stack (2007), Avery and Levin (forthcoming), and Haque (2009).<ref type="bibr" target="#b14">4</ref> When candidates fall through the cracks, the result is an unstable matching because after the fact the candidate and a potential employer would both prefer to be matched with each other than with their eventual partner (for background, seeGale and Shapley, 1962;<ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Roth and Sotomayor, 1990)</ref>. Note that the relevant matching models for interviews are many-to-many matching because both employers and candidates can participate in multiple interviews.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="6">How signals affect the chances of receiving fl y-outs or job offers is also of interest, but data for these outcomes are too sparse to draw conclusions.<ref type="bibr" target="#b17">7</ref> In a similar spirit, Lee, Niederle, Kim, and Kim (2009) performed an experiment on a Korean dating site in which participants were allowed different numbers of signals. They observed that participants allowed more signals were more successful in fi nding matches.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="8">We investigated the possibility of nonresponse bias by comparing the characteristics of those who responded to our survey about job market outcomes to those of all signalers. These characteristics include indicator variables for current graduate student, economics as primary fi eld, degree from a U.S. institution, tier of degree-granting institution (as defi ned inTable 2), and tier of employers signaled. Ratios for these variables in the survey sample and population were virtually identical.<ref type="bibr" target="#b19">9</ref> In the reported regression results, we use the applicant as the panel variable to address unobserved applicant quality. We also ran each regression using the employer as the panel variable and using a two-way clustered standard errors ordinary least squares model, fi nding similar results. Using applicant fi xed effects instead of random effects, and logit specifi cations rather than ordinary least squares, again produces similar results.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="10">In the sample used for these regressions, 10 percent of job postings received seven or more signals (and these accounted for 36 percent of signals in the sample). For comparison, within our entire dataset, 12 percent of postings in 2007 and 2008 received seven or more signals (accounting for 37 percent of signals).</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="12">The visible employers in 2009 consisted of 20 universities with graduate programs, 18 four-year colleges, 10 consulting or research fi rms, seven federal government agencies, four banking or fi nance fi rms, and two "other." The employers who chose to remain invisible consisted of eight universities with graduate programs, three four-year colleges, three federal government agencies, two consulting or research fi rms, and one banking or fi nance fi rm.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="13">However, university-specifi c application protocols may partly serve to impose a small cost on applicants who may be deterred from making the most marginal applications.<ref type="bibr" target="#b24">14</ref> John Rust writes: "[Y]ou can get a sense of the rate of growth from the date the account applications were approved: 39 by end of 2007 (EJM's fi rst year of operation), 139 by end of 2008, and 172 as of today [Sept. 23, 2009]" (personal communication). He further writes (2/28/10): "EJM is starting to see increasing "secondary market trading" for tenured professorships and other positions that are not connected with the North American new Ph.D. hiring cycle."</note>
