				<p>In this study, we sought evidence for alpha-synuclein (ASYN) expression in oligodendrocytes, as a possible endogenous source of ASYN to explain its presence in glial inclusions found in multiple system atrophy (MSA) and Parkinson&apos;s disease (PD). We identified ASYN in oligodendrocyte lineage progenitors isolated from the rodent brain, in oligodendrocytes generated from embryonic stem cells, and in induced pluripotent stem cells produced from fibroblasts of a healthy individual and patients diagnosed with MSA or PD, in cultures in vitro. Notably, we observed a significant decrease in ASYN during oligodendrocyte maturation. Additionally, we show the presence of transcripts in PDGFRA/CD140a + cells and SOX10 + oligodendrocyte lineage nuclei isolated by FACS from rodent and human healthy and diseased brains, respectively. Our work identifies ASYN in oligodendrocyte lineage cells, and it offers additional in vitro cellular models that should provide significant insights of the functional implication of ASYN during oligodendrocyte development and disease.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>Multiple system atrophy (MSA) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are adult-onset progressive neurodegenerative diseases that are hallmarked at the cellular level by the presence of alpha-synuclein (ASYN) protein containing inclusions. Interestingly, the inclusions are found in neurons in PD, where the SNCA gene encoding for ASYN protein is expressed, whereas they are prominent in oligodendrocytes as glial cytoplasmic inclusions (GCIs) in MSA <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Papp et al., 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Stefanova et al., 2009)</ref>. Because strong evidence showing that oligodendrocytes in the adult brain are capable of expressing SNCA is lacking, recent studies inspired from parkinsonian experimental models have proposed the interesting hypothesis that ASYN present in GCIs in MSA could be of neuronal origin and transfer to oligodendrocytes <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Kisos et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Reyes et al., 2014)</ref>, where it would accumulate and potentially lead to oligodendrocyte dysfunction. However, more than a decade ago, Richter-Landsberg and coworkers reported on the transient expression of Snca in cultures enriched in oligodendrocytes, prepared by mechanical shaking of mixed rat glial primary brain cultures <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Richter-Landsberg et al., 2000)</ref>. This finding, however, was neither confirmed nor further explored, and in vivo evidences of ASYN expression during oligodendrocyte maturation are still missing. Consequently, follow-up studies mainly focused on understanding the functional consequences of wild-type or mutant human ASYN targeted expression in oligodendrocytes in experimental models in vivo and in vitro <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Kragh et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Yazawa et al., 2005)</ref>.</p><p>To date, the origin of ASYN in GCIs in oligodendrocytes in MSA is still elusive, as is that of the few inclusions found in glial cells in the substantia nigra of people with PD <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Wakabayashi et al., 2000)</ref>. For these reasons, ASYN expression in oligodendrocytes remains to be firmly established, especially since investigations using patient material are still controversial <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Asi et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Miller et al., 2005)</ref>. One way to explore ASYN expression in human oligodendrocytes is through the generation of human cellular models such as induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), since patient oligodendrocytes are not always accessible postmortem.</p><p>Here using several murine and human cellular models, we present compelling evidence for ASYN expression during oligodendrocyte lineage cell development. Moreover, we identified both ASYN protein and transcripts in purified PDGFRA/CD140a + oligodendrocyte progenitors and oligodendrocyte lineage SOX10 + nuclei, isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) from the rodent wild-type brain and human healthy and diseased brains, respectively, therefore substantiating a functional role for ASYN in oligodendrocytes.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ASYN Protein and Transcripts Identified in O4 + Oligodendrocytes in Mouse Brain Primary Cultures</head><p>Oligodendrocytes are abundantly produced during development and at neonatal age <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Kessaris et al., 2006)</ref>. The postnatal forebrain, therefore, should provide a rapid source of oligodendrocytes at different stages of maturation for experimental investigations in vitro.</p><p>We performed immunocytochemistry (ICC) on dissociated cell cultures from mouse neonates, grown for 3 weeks in vitro ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1A</ref>). These cultures were composed of beta-III-tubulin (B-III-TUB)-expressing neurons (z2%), glial-fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-expressing astrocytes (z75%), IBA1-expressing microglia (z15%), and oligodendrocyte lineage-specific glycolipid antigen (O4)-positive oligodendrocytes (z8%) ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figures  1B-1D</ref>; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure S1A</ref>). Importantly, ICC for each of these cell-type-specific markers and ASYN showed specific localization of ASYN in B-III-TUB + neurons and in O4 + oligodendrocytes ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figures 1B-1D</ref>; Figures S1A and S1B). (E) Quantitative real-time PCR analysis shows the abundance (&gt;10-fold) of Snca transcripts in FACS-purified O4 + oligodendrocyte samples compared to whole primary culture sample. Oligodendrocyte enrichment is assessed by the quantification of oligodendrocyte-specific marker transcripts and the absence of astrocytic Gfap transcripts (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures). Mean ± SEM; n = 3-4 independent experiments; t test, *p &lt; 0.05, **p &lt; 0.01. (F) The set of primers we designed to assess mouse Snca expression by quantitative realtime PCR recognizes a unique product of 271 bp and was tested on two independent cultures. (G) Quantitative real-time PCR analysis shows significant enrichment in Cyclin-D1 transcripts in purified O4 + oligodendrocyte sample compared to whole primary culture sample. Mean ± SEM; n = 3 independent experiments; t test, *p &lt; 0.05. (H) Identification of KI67 + /O4 + /ASYN + oligodendrocyte in rodent postnatal primary forebrain culture. Nuclei are counterstained with DAPI. Insets show higher magnification of the region indicated with straight lines. The scale bar represents 50 mm.</p><p>We isolated O4 + oligodendrocytes by FACS from the rest of the cells present in our primary cultures, and we measured the abundance of total Snca transcripts by quantitative realtime PCR. Consistent over multiple rounds of experiments, our quantitative real-time PCR data clearly showed the presence of Snca transcripts (&gt;10-fold increase relative to the whole culture) in the O4 + -purified samples ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figures 1E and  1F)</ref>, therefore suggesting that O4 + oligodendrocytes indeed do express the Snca gene encoding for ASYN.</p><p>Interestingly, we identified ASYN protein and Snca transcripts in cycling oligodendrocytes, probably oligodendrocyte progenitors ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figures 1G and 1H</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Decreased ASYN Expression during Oligodendrocyte Maturation</head><p>To become mature and capable of myelinating axons, oligodendrocytes undergo different stages of maturation, each characterized by temporal expression of specific markers <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Zhang, 2001)</ref>.</p><p>Interestingly, while we previously found that &gt;90% of O4 + immature oligodendrocytes present in mice primary postnatal forebrain cultures co-expressed ASYN, we observed a strong reduction (up to 70% less compared to O4 + oligodendrocytes) in co-expression of ASYN and the mature oligodendrocyte markers 2 0 ,3 0 -cyclic nucleotide 3 0 -phosphodiesterase (CNPASE, &lt;40%), galactocerebroside (GAL-C, &lt;35%), and myelin basic protein (MBP, &lt;25%), clearly identifiable by confocal microscopy <ref type="bibr">(Figures 2A and 2B;</ref><ref type="bibr">Figure S2)</ref>. In marked contrast, ASYN expression was high in immature platelet-derived growth factor receptor alphapositive (PDGFRA) oligodendrocyte progenitors, measured by ICC and quantitative real-time PCR (Figures 2C and 2D). Our data, therefore, suggest that ASYN expression decreases during oligodendrocyte maturation and is present as early as PDGFRA + oligodendrocyte progenitor stage.</p><p>To ascertain that ASYN expression was specific to oligodendrocyte development and not the result of a transient expression due to the passage of cells isolated from the brain to an in vitro culture system, we investigated ASYN expression during the generation of oligodendrocytes from mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2E</ref>). We derived ESC from wild-type mice, which we differentiated into oligodendrocytes using a previously published protocol <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Czepiel et al., 2011)</ref>. We first ascertained the downregulation and upregulation of pluripotent marker Oct4 and oligodendrocyte lineage-specific markers SRY (sexdetermining region Y)-box 10 (SOX10), PDGFRA, CNPASE, and MBP, respectively, by quantitative real-time PCR, western blot, and ICC (Figures 2F-2H; data not shown), during mESC differentiation. We next confirmed the abundance of Snca transcripts and ASYN protein in our cultures, by quantitative real-time PCR, western blot, and ICC ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figures  2F-2H</ref>). Importantly, we found that the majority of O4 + oligodendrocytes expressed Snca ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2H</ref>), and that, yet again, ASYN decreases during oligodendrocyte maturation ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2H</ref>).</p><p>Oligodendrocytes Generated from iPSCs from a Healthy Individual and Patients with PD or MSA Also Express SNCA Because ASYN expression in oligodendrocytes from MSA patients is debated and that in oligodendrocytes of people (B) Rodent postnatal primary forebrain cultures contain O4 + immature oligodendrocytes (z70% of total oligodendrocyte markers) and CNPASE + , GAL-C + , and MBP + (&lt;20% for all three markers) mature oligodendrocytes. Mean ± SEM; n = 2-3 independent experiments. There is decreased coexpression between ASYN and CNPASE, GAL-C, or MBP compared to O4 + oligodendrocytes. Mean ± SEM; n = 2-3 independent experiments. (C) Rodent postnatal primary forebrain cultures contain PDGFRA + oligodendrocyte progenitors expressing ASYN. Nuclei are counterstained with DAPI. White arrowhead pinpoints an O4 À /ASYN + /PDGFRA + oligodendrocyte progenitor. The scale bar represents 50 mm. (D) Quantitative real-time PCR analysis shows the abundance (&gt;10-fold) of Snca transcripts in FACS-purified PDGFRA + oligodendrocyte progenitor samples compared to PDGFRA + oligodendrocyte progenitor-depleted samples. Enrichment in oligodendrocyte progenitors is assessed by the quantification of Pdgfra transcripts and the absence of astrocytic Gfap and mature oligodendrocytic Mbp transcripts. Mean ± SEM; n = 2-3 independent experiments. (E) Experimental approach used for assessing ASYN expression during rodent oligodendrocyte development. The mESCs were derived from a blastocyste aged E3.5 and subsequently differentiated into oligodendrocytes for a period of 4-5 weeks in vitro. with PD is still elusive, we generated iPSCs from fibroblasts ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3A)</ref> of MSA patients diagnosed with cerebellar ataxia (MSA-C, patient 4) or parkinsonism (MSA-C, patient 6), a patient diagnosed with a familial form of PD (patient 3), and a healthy individual (patient 9), and assessed ASYN expression in oligodendrocyte lineage cells <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Figure 3A)</ref>. All iPSC clones selected were expanded and cryopreserved. Random clones were selected and processed for further analysis. Thus, clones CSC-3A, B, G, and S; CSC-4A and B; CSC-6A; and CSC-9A and B underwent rigorous characterization through a battery of tests (summarized in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure S3</ref>), which indicated that we had effectively generated iPSCs.</p><p>We attempted to generate oligodendrocytes from our iPSC lines. To rule out the possibility of chromosomal abnormalities influencing ASYN expression in iPSC-derived oligodendrocytes, we selected one clone per patientspecific iPSC line presenting a normal karyotype to carry out most of our investigations. We devised a protocol, modified from that of Stacpoole and coworkers <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Stacpoole et al., 2013)</ref>, where we employed dual inhibition of SMAD signaling by small molecules LDN and SB to neutralize our cultures, sonic hedgehog-mediated ventral patterning, and PDGF-AA/IGF1/NT3/T3/HGF-mediated terminal differentiation. This modified protocol, proven efficient when applied to the human ESC lines H13 and H3 ( <ref type="figure">Figure S4</ref>; data not shown), successfully produced oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) and mature oligodendrocytes from iPSCs. Thus, by 60 days in vitro (DIV), nearly all SOX10 + cells co-expressed NKX2.2 and OLIG2, NG2, and PDGFRA and O4 ( <ref type="figure">Figures S5A-S5C</ref> and S6A), and those cells exhibited in majority an immature-bipolar morphology where ASYN could clearly be identified by confocal microscopy, quantitative real-time PCR, and western blot <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Figures 3B and 3C</ref>; <ref type="figure">Figures S5  and S6</ref>). Additionally, ASYN could be detected in neurons ( <ref type="figure">Figure S5D</ref>), whereas it was absent in astrocytes <ref type="figure">(Fig-ure S5E)</ref>. Interestingly, from 65 DIV onward, O4 + oligodendrocytes displayed a perinuclear localization of ASYN ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figures 3D and 3E)</ref>, as we observed for mouse O4 + oligodendrocytes <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figures 1 and 2)</ref>. In cultures aged 110 DIV, ASYN expression could still be detected in a few CNPASE + and MBP + mature oligodendrocytes ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3D</ref>), sometimes as a perinuclear dot ( <ref type="figure">Figure S6C</ref>; data not shown). Interestingly, the disease lines CSC-4A, CSC-4B, and CSC-3G gave rise to an accelerated high-yield generation of O4 + oligodendrocytes (up to 70% of live single cells) in 70 DIV ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3E</ref>). Finally, we confirmed the decrease in ASYN in O4 + oligodendrocytes over time ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3F</ref>) and the presence of SNCA transcripts in FACS-purified O4 + oligodendrocytes from the line CSC-3S aged 80 DIV ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3G</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ASYN Protein and Transcripts Identified in Oligodendrocytes from Mouse and Human Brains</head><p>We identified Snca transcripts in PDGFRA/CD140a + oligodendrocyte progenitors freshly isolated by FACS from embryonic day (E)18 mouse brains ( <ref type="figure">Figures 4A-4C</ref>). Importantly, we detected ASYN by ICC in nearly all oligodendrocytes present in homogenous cultures resulting from the isolation of E17.5 and E18 PDGFRA/CD140a + oligodendrocyte progenitors ( <ref type="figure">Figure 4D</ref>), ruling out the unlikely possibility that ASYN may have been transferred from neurons to oligodendrocytes in primary cultures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 1)</ref>. When these progenitors matured into O4 + oligodendrocytes <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Sim et al., 2011)</ref>, ASYN was still present, with the exception of a few oligodendrocytes having a more complex morphology ( <ref type="figure">Figure 4D</ref>).</p><p>Finally, we took advantage of a previously developed technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Ernst et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Yeung et al., 2014)</ref>, to isolate human oligodendrocyte lineage nuclei by FACS, to assess the presence of SNCA transcripts ( <ref type="figure">Figures 4E-4I)</ref>. We prepared nuclei samples from the pons of snap-frozen postmortem tissue from the following six patients: three healthy and three diagnosed with MSA with confirmed GCIs in oligodendrocytes ( <ref type="figure">Figure S7A</ref>). We isolated from each sample the oligodendrocyte lineage SOX10 + nuclei and quantified neuronal NEUN + nuclei by FACS <ref type="figure">(Figure 4G; Figure S7B</ref>). We detected a lower proportion of neurons in the pons region of the MSA patients <ref type="figure">(Figure 4H)</ref>, confirming the MSA diagnosis; we also found a lower percentage of SOX10 + nuclei in the diseased samples, although not significant ( <ref type="figure">Figure 4H</ref>). Importantly, we could detect the presence of SNCA transcripts in oligodendrocyte lineage nuclei of two samples isolated from the brain of a healthy and an MSA patient ( <ref type="figure">Figures  4H and 4I)</ref>, as described by <ref type="bibr">Asi and coworkers (Asi et al., 2014)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>The absence of SNCA transcripts in oligodendrocytes in the adult brain of healthy and MSA patients has been reported repeatedly <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Iwai et al., 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Miller et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Solano et al., 2000)</ref>, but recent studies have challenged these results. Because MSA has been identified as a nongenetic disorder, it is difficult to propose an explanation for the origin of ASYN in GCIs present in oligodendrocytes under pathological condition. This has led to the emergence of a hypothesis advocating a mechanism of cell-to-cell transfer of exogenous ASYN to oligodendrocytes, similar to that experimentally established from neuron-to-neuron in PD models <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Hansen et al., 2011)</ref>. However, the recent use of more advanced techniques, such as laser-capture micro-dissection, has allowed for the isolation of adult white matter glia from human postmortem tissue, resulting in the detection of SNCA tran-scripts from MSA, idiopathic PD, and control cases <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Asi et al., 2014)</ref>.</p><p>We clearly identified ASYN protein by ICC and western blotting and we detected transcripts by quantitative realtime PCR in oligodendrocyte lineage cells from rodent and human origins (summarized in <ref type="figure">Figure 4J</ref>). We could not detect ASYN expression in astrocytes and microglia, which are cell types known to take up exogenous ASYN <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Boza-Serrano et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Lee et al., 2010)</ref>. Moreover, the few neurons present in cultures combined with the multitude of media changes applied during the culture period, and the discovery of Snca/SNCA transcripts in freshly isolated oligodendrocytes and ASYN protein in homogenous cultures of freshly isolated, maturing PDGFRA/CD140a + oligodendrocyte progenitors, together allow us to rule out the possibility that healthy or dying neurons, even contaminating neurons, may have released large quantities of ASYN, which would accumulate, not being sufficiently degraded, in the oligodendrocytes only. Moreover, we showed relocation of ASYN during oligodendrocyte differentiation from the processes to the perinuclear space, where the protein appears as a single dot-like structure suggesting it is finally degraded.</p><p>We identified SNCA transcripts in human SOX10 + oligodendrocyte lineage nuclei samples isolated from healthy and MSA patients <ref type="figure">(Figure 4</ref>). This result is in line with recent observations <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Asi et al., 2014)</ref>. Whether ASYN expression identified in these two studies is reminiscent of a basal expression in quiescent OPCs, and the difference although not significant identified in oligodendrocytes from MSA and control samples is the result of a greater oligodendrogenesis probably triggered by neuronal injury <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ahmed et al., 2013)</ref> remain to be determined.</p><p>We found a decrease of ASYN associated with oligodendrocyte maturation characterized by complex cellular <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>. ASYN in Oligodendrocytes In Vivo (A) Schematic representation shows the experimental approach used for assessing ASYN in the mouse embryonic brain. (B) Quantification of PDGFRA/CD140a + oligodendrocyte progenitors and O4 + oligodendrocytes from the rodent brain at embryonic and postnatal stages, measured by FACS, is shown. (C) Loading of quantitative real-time PCR product confirms the presence of Snca transcripts in E18 PDGFRA/CD140a + oligodendrocyte progenitors, freshly isolated by FACS, from the mouse embryonic brain. (D) Detection of ASYN in homogenous cultures from mouse embryonic PDGFRA/CD140a + oligodendrocyte progenitors isolated by FACS at E17.5.

(F) FACS plots represent the gating strategy employed for isolating SOX10 + oligodendrocyte lineage nuclei from the samples.

Mean ± SEM; t test, *p &lt; 0.05. (H) Quantitative real-time PCR shows SNCA transcripts in SOX10 + oligodendrocyte lineage nuclei samples purified by FACS from patients T172 and T4640. (I) Loading of quantitative real-time PCR product confirms the presence of SNCA transcripts. The set of primers used to assess human SNCA expression by quantitative real-time PCR recognizes a unique product of 163 bp (from <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Asi et al., 2014)</ref>. (J) A summary of our findings is shown.</p><p>processes and expression of the mature marker MBP. Interestingly, overexpression of ASYN in OPCs delays their maturation into MBP + oligodendrocytes <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Ettle et al., 2014)</ref>. Additionally, we found that ASYN is decreased in pre-myelinating oligodendrocytes, regardless of the genetic background of the iPSC (diseased or healthy). This observation, although made in vitro, may allow us to rule out that the origin of ASYN in GCIs in MSA, and glial inclusions in PD, may result from the accumulation of a lifetime production of ASYN throughout glial lineages.</p><p>Successful generation of patient-specific iPSCs, and their subsequent differentiation into brain cell types, has opened up unlimited access of patient brain cells to a growing number of investigators interested in studying neurodegenerative diseases. Here we have pioneered the generation of oligodendrocytes from MSA and familial PD iPSC lines. Our protocol for generating oligodendrocytes from human iPSCs, therefore, adds on to those recently developed for studying demyelination diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Douvaras et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Numasawa-Kuroiwa et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Piao et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Stacpoole et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Wang et al., 2013)</ref>.
