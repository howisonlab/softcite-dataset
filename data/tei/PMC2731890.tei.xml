				<p>Potential promoters in the genome of Escherichia coli were searched by pattern recognition software PlatProm and classified on the basis of positions relative to gene borders. Beside the expected promoters located in front of the coding sequences we found a considerable amount of intragenic promoter-like signals with a putative ability to drive either antisense or alternative transcription and revealed unusual genomic regions with extremely high density of predicted transcription start points (promoter &apos;islands&apos;), some of which are located in coding sequences. PlatProm scores converted into probability of RNA polymerase binding demonstrated certain correlation with the enzyme retention registered by ChIP-on-chip technique; however, in &apos;dense&apos; regions the value of correlation coefficient is lower than throughout the entire genome. Experimental verification confirmed the ability of RNA polymerase to interact and form multiple open complexes within promoter &apos;island&apos; associated with appY, yet transcription efficiency was lower than might be expected. Analysis of expression data revealed the same tendency for other promoter &apos;islands&apos;, thus assuming functional relevance of non-productive RNA polymerase binding. Our data indicate that genomic DNA of E. coli is enriched by numerous unusual promoter-like sites with biological role yet to be understood.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>Even though expression data are now available for many organisms, a possibility to use them for tracking cell transcriptional output upon varying conditions requires a comprehensive map of genome regulatory elements. Currently there are two approaches opening a way to depict this map: computational search of promoter regions [most recent algorithms: (1-10)], and ChIP-on-chip spotting of RNA polymerase (RNAPol)-binding sites <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>. In this study we tried to understand how predictable the data obtained in silico are and to what extent they correlate with the data obtained in vivo.</p><p>The genome-scale mapping of promoter sites has been performed by our pattern recognition software PlatProm <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7)</ref>. The same as other protocols operating with position-specific weight matrices, PlatProm has an advantage of predicting transcription start points (TSP) (the main promoter attribute, which is determined experimentally), rather than to define promoter regions as extensive genomic loci <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16)</ref>. Upon scanning PlatProm considers any nucleotide as a probable point of transcription initiation and scores this probability by searching for promoter-specific elements in proper positions. Rather high precision and low rate of false positives made our software suitable for genome scanning, providing a possibility to compare in silico and in vivo data. In the present work, we describe an overall map of TSPs predicted by PlatProm; evaluate the degree of correlation between PlatProm scores and RNAPol-binding efficiency registered by two independent research groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13)</ref>; focus attention on intragenic TSPs and promoter 'islands' having high density of transcription signals over long distance; and verify capacity of one 'island' to bind RNAPol and initiate RNA synthesis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MATERIALS AND METHODS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>An essence of computational approach</head><p>Our scoring system was designed as originally suggested by <ref type="bibr">Hertz and Stormo (17)</ref>. Sensitivity of this algorithm tested on our sets was the same as reported ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1B)</ref>. To increase the performance of this approach, we took into account sequence-dependent structural features in the genomic environment of promoter sites <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7)</ref>. The final version of PlatProm <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> was refined on 271 experimentally identified non-homologous and non-overlapping s 70 -promoters with a single TSP precisely pointed out by the previous version of our software <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>. All sequences were 411-bp long (À255/+155 according to the start point nominated as 0). Allowed variations of the spacer, and the distance between the TSP and the element -10 were 14-21 and 2-9 bp, respectively. Variable length of the spacer was accounted by the matrix penalizing deviations from the optimal 17 bp in accordance with their frequencies in the training promoter set. The varying distance between element À10 and the TSP, ignored by previously published protocols, was taken into account the same way. Weight matrices corresponding to consensus elements À35 and À10 evaluated hexanucleotides, rather than 25 and 19 bp sequences, accounted by Hertz and Stormo ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1A and B</ref>). They contain 6 Â 4 scores equal to natural logarithms of normalized occurrence frequencies for each nucleotide at each position in preliminarily aligned promoters. Percentage of particular nucleotides in the genome was used for normalization. Sequence preference nearby the TSP previously accounted by a 12 Â 4 weight matrix <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref> was scored by the matrix precisely reflecting the distribution of dinucleotides in À1/0. Dinucleotides forming the 'extended À10 element' were accounted the same way. Since frequency coefficients depend on promoter alignment, optimal matrices were generated by the procedure of expectation-maximization.</p><p>Additional sequence motifs were scored by the set of 34 cascade matrices exemplified in ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>. They include di-, tri-and tetranucleotides having occurrence frequencies at least 5 SD higher than the background level in the particular positions of 34 promoter subregions ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1B</ref>). These matrices represent:</p><p>(i) Sequence motifs potentially interacting with RNA polymerase a-subunits, including (A) n -tracts as perfect targets <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref>. (ii) (T) n -and (A) n (T) n -tracts able to promote additional protein-protein or DNA-protein contacts by inducing proper bending of the DNA helix <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref>. (iii) Elements containing flexible YR steps (Y = T = C, R = A = G) favoring adaptive isomerization of the promoter DNA <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref>. (iv) Other motifs previously revealed by cluster analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref>.</p><p>Cascade matrices consider all sequence elements dominant in a particular promoter subregion, but only the most significant one found in a certain promoter is taken into account. Thus, for instance, there are 30 motifs dominating in the region À48/À41. The most frequent of them, hence the most significant one, is ATAA if located in position À44. It gives 0.91 to the overall score. Slightly less significant (contribution 0.82) is TATA if located in À45. Thus, for promoter containing TATAT in À45/À41 the overall score increases by 0.82, while for promoter, containing TATAA -by 0.91, rather than by 0.91+0.82. Lack of accounted motifs in a particular subregion of a promoter was penalized based on probability of their absence in this place in the training set.</p><p>Ten cascade matrices were used to formalize the presence of mixed w-tracts (w = A = T), highly typical for promoter DNA. They are regularly distributed with 1 or 1.5 helix turns periodicity ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1B</ref>) and may participate in polymerase sliding along DNA <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref>. To focus attention on the observed regularity we search for www(n) 7,8 www and www(n) 13,14 www thus minimizing overlap with (A) n -and (T) n -specific matrices.</p><p>PlatProm also takes into account perfect direct and inverted repeats (5-11 bp long separated by 5 or 6 bp) as potential targets for interaction with regulatory proteins. They are scored as natural logarithms of lengths if centered in subregions of their frequent occurrence ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1B)</ref>.</p><p>The contributions of both types of repeats and elements accounted by cascade matrices were reduced by coefficients estimated as a ratio of the average information content [quantified as described in ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref>] in the particular subregion to the information content in the sixth position of the aligned element -35 (the least significant among conservative base pairs). This reduction was aimed to balance the endowment of additional elements with that of conservative base pairs. Inputs of all elements were summarized, giving the total score (S), which reflects the probability for any nucleotide to be a TSP and therefore the probability of its upstream region to bind RNAPol and fulfill promoter function.</p><p>Performance of the program was tested on a set of 290 known promoters and two control sets (CSs). All sequences were 411 bp long (À255/+155 according to real or virtual TSPs). The testing compilation was composed of experimentally characterized s 70 promoters not included in the training set. To increase the size of this set we allowed the presence of promoters ($30%) with multiple TSPs (for instance discussed below dcuA), while homologous or overlapping promoters were excluded. CS1 was composed of 273 coding sequences taken from the fixed position of all convergent genes longer than 700 bp, separated by 50-bp intergenic space, which are not associated with promoter 'islands' (see below) and have 5 0 -ends similarly annotated in U00096 and U00096.2 E. coli gene maps. Sequences were taken so as virtual TSPs were 250 bp far from initiating codon (fall in position 254 inside the gene). This strategy minimizes the probability to pick out functional promoter for alternative transcription or for yet unidentified genes in intergenic regions. Having AT-content (48.3%) very close to that of the whole genome (49.2%) CS1 roughly represents natural sequences, which RNAPol has to bypass. CS2 was composed of 400 random sequences with the same AT-content as in chromosomal DNA. (All compilations are available by request.) Promoters were considered as recognized by PlatProm if experimentally mapped TSP(s) or a neighboring nucleotide (AE2) had score higher than threshold level. Using this criteria and the last version of PlatProm we identified 85.5% of promoters from the test compilation at zero level of false positives (level 1, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref>) in both CSs (S max = 3.4). Thus, at this level the combination of sensitivity (percentage of recognized promoters = 85.5%) and specificity (percentage of unrecognized non-promoter sequences = 100%) of PlatProm was better than that of previously suggested algorithms (68.7-82% and 82.2-99.1%, respectively) [ <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24)</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1C</ref>]. Approximately 80% of recognized promoters possess experimentally mapped TSPs coinciding (in the range of AE 2 bp) with positions of local S maxima, i.e. nearly 70% of natural TSPs are accurately predicted by our software, which is also better than previously reported (&lt;50%) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental procedures</head><p>The E. coli K12 strain was used as a source of genomic DNA and total RNA. DNA was isolated by phenolchloroform extraction. Total RNA was purified as described in ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>.</p><p>Three DNA fragments containing part of promoter 'island' associated with appY were obtained by PCR. A 406-bp fragment spanning over the region À260/+146 relative to the initiating codon of appY was amplified using the primers 5 0 -GCAAGAGGTTTCAGGTGCGTT GTAGTGAG-3 0 (F1) and 5 0 -CTTAGTTTAGAGGGGC AT-3 0 (R1). Shortened (378 bp) and elongated (471 bp) templates were obtained with F1 + 5 0 -CCCTTCTAGAT TTGTCGCTTACAATAAA-3 0 (R2) (À260/+118) and 5 0 -GATAAGATCTGCAAGTAAAAATGATACTC-3 0 (F2) + R1 (À325/+146), respectively.</p><p>RNAPol-s 70 -binding ability was tested by gelretardation and potassium permanganate footprinting. Complexes were formed at 378C in buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM DTT, 10 mM MgCl 2 , 50 mM NaCl, 250 mkg/ml BSA, 1 pm of 406-bp DNA-fragment and 2-8 pm of RNAPol. Templates for permanganate footprinting were 32 Plabeled. Interaction was allowed for 30 min. In gel-shift experiments, 20 mkg/ml of heparin was added before loading the sample on 4% polyacrylamide gel pre-warmed to 378C. Gels were run at the same temperature and stained by ethydium bromide. Footprinting assays were performed according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref>. Unpaired thymines in open transcription complexes were modified by potassium permanganate and revealed after piperidine treatment. The products of chemical hydrolysis were separated in 8% polyacrylamide gel in the presence of 8 M urea and visualized by radioautography.</p><p>Primer extension was carried out using RevertAid TM M-MulV reverse transcriptase (Fermentas), 4 pm of 32 P-labeled primer and variable amounts of total RNA (1-6 mkg) purified from E. coli cells grown either in LB or M9 media and harvested at logarithmic or stationary phases. Before the reaction the mixture of RNA and primer was heated at 728C for 10 min; cooled down to 588C, and primer annealing was allowed for 3 min. Then the probe was chilled on ice, mixed with the buffer provided by manufacturer and incubated with the enzyme at 428C for 45 min. Reverse transcription was terminated by heating. cDNA was precipitated by N-butanol and analyzed the same way as the products of permanganate footprinting.</p><p>Single round transcription was carried out as described previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1B</ref>) and increased sensitivity of the program ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1C</ref> and D) for the whole testing compilation and positively regulated promoters. All additional elements improve the resolution but the largest contribution is given by w-tracts increasing sensitivity for 27.6% ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1B</ref>). This high significance of additional elements provides a chance to detect regulatory regions in newly sequenced genomes if information about their own promoters is insufficient. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref> exemplifies promoters accurately recognized (fadB) and unrecognized (dcuA) by PlatProm. The start point of fadB-transcription exactly fits the experimentally mapped TSP ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2B</ref>), while the original program <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref> suggests intragenic P1 as a dominant transcription signal ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2A</ref> Unrecognized promoter P dcuA ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2D</ref>-F) has four TSPs, experimentally mapped 69-72 bp upstream of the initiating codon <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref>. S values at these positions vary in the range À2.1/À5.7, i.e. far below the level required for recognition. All promoter-specific elements in P dcuA are weakly pronounced, thus no refinement of the current scoring system can compensate for these negative values. Although it can not be excluded that P dcuA has some important determinants, which are not formalized by PlatProm, limitations of experimental mapping performed by primer extension (28) also may result in some difference between apparent and actual TSPs. Reverse transcriptase, for example, can stop at sites with stable hairpins in mRNA structure. In this case, the registered site of transcription initiation would be pointed out downstream from the real one. PlatProm predicts a good candidate (P2) perfectly fitting the RNAPol-binding site registered by ChIP-on-chip assay ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2F</ref>). Thus, comparing in silico and in vivo data one should take into account finite sensitivity and selectivity of computer model as well as limited accuracy of experimental approaches. Even though PlatProm may be further improved on the basis of additional features, current version predicts TSPs with rather high accuracy and was used to depict the genome-wide distribution of potentially transcribed regions.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Genome scanning revealed unexpected intragenic promoters</head><p>The genome sequence of E. coli K12 (NCBI, GenBank entry U00096.2) was used for large-scale promoter prediction (see <ref type="table">Supplementary Table 1</ref> for all PlatProm scores on both strands). Only signals with S &gt;7.44 (level 2 in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1D</ref>) were considered reliable. This cut-off level provides a possibility to identify only 51.0% of known promoters ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1D</ref>) but ensures p &lt; 0.000043 (Student's T-test statistics) if average S (À5.0) and SD (3.1) were estimated using scores of CS1. Artificially generated sequences of CS2 showed the same variability of S (SD = 3.1) but average score was higher (À4.2), thus assuming $2.5-fold higher p-value (p &lt; 0.00011). A total of 30 188 individual or clustered TSPs ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref>) forming $5000 promoter-like regions were found. Since only half of known promoters have TSPs with S &gt;7.44, the data obtained presume existence of more than 9000 of separate promoter-like sites, which is twice greater than the number of annotated genes in the genome of E. coli. To what extent this excess could be explained by the presence of false positives?</p><p>Relying on p-values only 399-928 of 30 188 predicted TSPs (1-3%) may be false signals (4 639 675 bp Â 2 Â p). However, intragenic and artificial sequences of CS1 and CS2 may be deficient in some promoter-specific features. That is why PlatProm performance was further tested in intergenic regions separating convergent genes, even though each of them may contain yet unidentified genes. Predicted TSPs were searched in the central part of intergenic space (!250 bp from the ends of flanking genes) so as to ensure that only non-coding sequences undergo scoring. Only 15 regions between convergent genes are longer than 500 bp but two of them overlap with promoter 'islands' (see below) and were eliminated. The total length of the remaining ones is 10 226 bp (both strands). As expected, AT-content of these regions is slightly higher (49.2%) than that of CS1 (48.3%). Altogether they contain four predicted TSPs (one per $2500 bp). If all of them are spurious, the probability to come across a false positive is 0.00039, i.e. higher than p-values mentioned above. However, two predicted TSPs are perfectly suitable for small regulatory RNAs HB_48 and HB_139 predicted by Carter et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29)</ref> and one is located in front of IS yi21_6. Supposing that they belong to real promoters, false positive rate given by statistic analysis and scanning procedure correspond to each other. Even if p = 0.00039 is taken as a real frequency of false signals, still $90% of TSPs predicted by PlatProm should be considered as promoter-like signals deserving more detailed analysis.</p><p>An important question is how to perceive PlatProm signals forming clusters near real and accurately recognized by PlatProm TSPs (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2B</ref> for example). Should they be considered as false positives or not? To address this question we compared distribution of scores in positions surrounding real (test compilation) and virtual (CS1) transcription starts ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1E-G</ref>). An average S quantified for CS1 remains almost constant if the size of analyzed area increases. The number of signals exceeding 'level 1' in AE 2 and AE 5 bp area (11 and 24, respectively) corresponds to the expected values (11 and 26, respectively) if CS2 statistic is used but is twice larger than expected from p-value (&lt;0.0038) calculated on the basis of CS1 scores (6 and 12). The rate of false positives given by CS2 statistic is, therefore, quite realistic. It assumes 0.63 probability for the presence of highly scoring position in the AE 10 area around virtual TSPs of CS1 (total number of positions is 5733). One signal with S &gt;7.44 ('level 2') was really registered in this region ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1G</ref>).</p><p>Portion of positions with S exceeding 'level 2' and the average S decrease upon widening of the analyzed area around real promoters, however, distribution of their scores does not reveal expected maxima typical for CS1 ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1E</ref> and F). Only in AE10 region S-values show noticeable divergence. That means that PlatProm scores around real TSPs are higher than background values. Thus, the total number of positions with S &gt;3.4 for AE2 bp area (1681 points) is significantly larger (852) than the total number of experimentally mapped starts including multiple ones (480). Detailed examination showed that $92% of additional signals are generated by PlatProm using the same frame for À35 and À10 hexanucleotides as position with maximal S. Remaining ones correspond to alternative À10 element (4.4%) or À10 and À35 elements (3.6%), suggesting the presence of overlapping promoter. Promoters with multiple TSPs tend to have additional signals corresponding to alternative pair of core elements. Thus, in all cases PlatProm signals proximal to known TSPs denote the presence of either the same or alternative promoter and should not be considered as false positives.</p><p>Predicted TSPs were classified in respect to the borders of mapped genes considering 750 bp as the allowed distance between the predicted transcription starts and the coding sequences of downstream genes [$10% of known promoters are 250-700 bp far from the coding sequences <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>]. Most predicted TSPs were ranked by this strategy as 'expected' promoters ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 3</ref>), although some of them fall into upstream genes (see, for instance P2 in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2E</ref>).</p><p>Approximately 19% of the remaining TSPs were found on the opposite strand of coding sequences <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Figure 3</ref>). Antisense RNAs, if initiated therein, may block translation by base pairing with mRNAs, regulate their stability or interfere in other molecular processes. Such RNAs control expression of many plasmid and transposon genes, but until now they were not considered typical for bacterial regulatory networks. Nonetheless several lines of evidence support our predictions: Thus, the first amusing outcome obtained from the genome scanning was a large amount of genes containing promoters with antisense orientation. Unexpected intragenic promoters of another group have sense orientation <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Figure 3</ref>). About 23% of corresponding TSPs lie &lt;50 bp downstream from the initiating codon. They were not considered as candidates for independent transcription initiation, since corresponding promoter-like regions may participate in polymerase trapping near real promoters <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>. Some intragenic promoters may intensify transcription of properly oriented downstream genes. If they are also ignored, there are still $400 potential TSPs with a less comprehensible destination. Some of them may produce RNAs antisense to mRNAs of the convergently oriented downstream genes. Synthesis of shortened mRNAs seems to be the most exotic assumption to date. At the same time, ORF Finder (NCBI) reveals alternative ORFs supplied with a suitable Shine-Dalgarno sequence downstream of $50% of intragenic co-directed promoters.</p><p>The genome of E. coli has promoter 'islands' with high density of promoter-like signals</p><p>In silico promoter mapping revealed 78 unusual genomic regions spanning for at least 300 bp and containing eight or more potential TSPs on any strand in the running window of 100 bp. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 4B</ref> exemplifies this phenomenon. We call these regions 'promoter islands' (PI) so as to distinguish them from clustered 'promoter-like signals' ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2B</ref>) found in front of almost all (92%) genes of E. coli <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36)</ref>. ChIP-on-chip assays registered complexes with RNAPol for all three PIs in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 4</ref> (D and E). However, transcription efficiency from appY-associated PI1 seemed to be much weaker than that from PI3, containing promoters for ompT and pauD and PI2 carrying out antisense transcription from ompT ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 4F</ref>). This curious observation prompted us to verify promoter activity within the appY genomic locus.</p><p>In perfect conformity with ChIP-on-chip data ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 4D and E)</ref>, the 406-bp DNA fragment, containing both the expected intergenic promoters and unusual intragenic promoter-like sites within appY, formed two major heparin-resistant complexes with RNAPol ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 5A</ref>). Their relative abundance depended on enzyme:DNA ratio, supposing two or more sites for simultaneous interaction with the enzyme. Permanganate footprinting  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 5B</ref>). Three of them lie $190 (I), $155 (II) and $90 bp (III) upstream from the appY ATG codon, and are suitable candidates for appY promoters, while the fourth one is located within the coding sequence ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 5C</ref>). Single round transcription assay performed with the same DNA fragment ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 5D</ref>, lane 2) testified synthesis of two major RNA-products: $305 and $237 nt. Two additional templates were used to ascribe them to particular transcription bubbles. The longer product may be initiated at either PII, or PIV ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 5C</ref>).</p><p>It remains unchanged when template shortened in the coding region was used (lane 3), while becomes $65 nt longer when DNA fragment elongated in opposite direction was taken for transcription assay (lane 1). Thus we conclude that $305 nt-RNA is initiated at PIV and is transcribed in antisense direction. Since the $237 nt-product, vice versa, remains unchanged when the longer DNA fragment is used but becomes shorter in the case of the shortened template, it can be transcribed only from PIII towards the coding sequence of appY and, therefore, may represent appY-mRNA. However, reverse transcription from total RNA failed to reveal the expected cDNAs in any of five experiments performed in different conditions ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 5E</ref>).</p><p>Low-transcription efficiency of appY in vivo is consistent with the expression data [ <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 4F</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>] and the data obtained by Isalan et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(37)</ref>, who tested nearly 600 cross-combinations of genes encoding transcription regulators or s-factors and their promoters. Reporter gene expression [ <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Supplementary 1_GFP</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(37)</ref>] indicated increased transcription in 17 out of 22 constructions when cognate promoters were replaced by appY regulatory region, thus assuming very high activity of appY promoter. The effect, however, was quite opposite if the appY coding sequence was fused to different promoters. Transcription efficiency of the reporter gene significantly decreased practically for all promoters. Thus, it appears to be that strong interaction with RNAPol and even ability to form open complexes do not necessarily result in efficient RNA synthesis. In the case of appY transcription depends on impediments buried in its coding sequence. Intragenic promoter-like sites certainly may play such a role. Genomic DNA of E. coli, therefore, contains several types of promoter-like sites with poorly understood function. ChIP-on-chip data were used to evaluate the ability of predicted promoters to bind RNAPol in the genomewide scale.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Coordinates of predicted promoters overlap with RNAPol-binding sites found in vivo</head><p>Three questions were addressed to compare in silico and in vivo data: To answer the first question, we used the whole set of 30 188 predicted TSPs. They form 4810 clusters or single promoter-like sites separated from each other by at least 100 bp (overlapping clusters on opposite DNA strands were combined). Predicted TSPs or TSP clusters were considered as confirmed by in vivo data, if at least one positive chip probe was found by <ref type="bibr">Reppas et al. [(13)</ref>; experiment B] within a AE 100 bp surrounding region ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2B</ref> and C illustrate scrutinized area). Ninety-four percent of individual TSPs (or 77% of promoter clusters) fall into genomic loci interacting with RNAPol in vivo or are located within the allowed distance. Thus, most predicted promoters of all types perform at least one promoter function.</p><p>To address the second question, we used the set of microarray probes efficiently hybridized with enzymetrapped DNAs. A total of 51 922 probes show fluorescent signal at least 2-fold higher if RNAPol-DNA complexes were extracted using specific antibodies ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2F</ref>). They represent 1209 continuous genomic regions. RNAPol residence sites observed in vivo were considered related to potential promoters if at least one TSP with S &gt; 7.44 was found within region covered by oligonucleotide probes or in AE100 bp surrounding area. Ninety-three percent of individual probes (86.8% of continuous regions) appeared to be associated with predicted promoter sites.</p><p>All 78 promoter 'islands' form extensive complexes with RNAPol <ref type="table">(Supplementary Table 2</ref>). This coincident disposition of TSPs found in silico and polymerase-binding sites registered in vivo allows considering coordinates of predicted TSPs as a valid map of transcription signals.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Scores of predicted promoters correlate with efficiency of RNA polymerase binding</head><p>At the last step we estimated the degree of correlation between the values of PlatProm scores, and efficiencies of RNAPol binding. Since S reflects probability of any single nucleotide in the genome to be a TSP, while ChIP-on-chip method estimates efficiency of RNAPol binding to a particular genomic region represented by 50 nt probes on high-density tiled microarrays, the pattern of S should be converted into a comparable mode. Converting procedure should take into account that the geometrical center of RNAPol-binding site does not coincide with the TSP. Moreover, as RNAPol in vivo interacts with double-stranded DNA, samples prepared for chiphybridization contained both strands of enzyme-trapped fragments. Thus, fluorescent signal registered for a particular probe may result from two types of complexes differing in enzyme orientation ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 4A</ref>). Supposing each 50 nt probe as a target for interaction with polymerase we thus considered the sum of S corresponding to the virtual TSPs on both strands as a probability of enzyme binding (P):</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">P ¼ AESðtÞ þ AESðbÞ: 1</formula><p>As the spacer length and the distance between the TSP and À10 element differ in real promoters, AE8 nt variation in +1 positioning has been allowed. Location of these regions relative to 5 0 -ends was selected experimentally as position giving maximal correlation coefficient (R) between P and hybridization signals. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 4C</ref> shows the predicted TSPs of the <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 4B</ref> converted in such a way. X-axis is shifted 1.96 SD (1 SD = 55.2) above the background level of P (average value of all negative P), providing p &lt; 0.05 for positive values.  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 4D</ref> and E), their profiles resemble each other and the pattern of P ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 4C)</ref>. Quantified values of R are 0.51 (R H ) and 0.38 (R R ), respectively ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 6</ref>). R H is comparable with R values estimated for three replicates performed in similar conditions by the same research group (R = 0.46; 0.48 and 0.52) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>.</p><p>Are these R H and R R values high or not? Although the data obtained in silico and in vivo reflect the same phenomena: anticipated and registered interaction with RNAPol, there are some peculiarities decreasing evaluated correlation. PlatProm, for instance, accounts putative modules for interaction with regulatory proteins as positive elements, though repressors decrease polymerase binding. Many weak RNAPol-binding sites are not detected in vivo due to low signal-to-noise ratio <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> but PlatProm discriminates them. Intensity of ChIP signals from some promoters may disproportionately decrease due to possibility of epitope occlusion by other interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>. Finally, PlatProm is currently attuned to s 70 -specific promoters, while s 70 -specific antibodies precipitate s 28 as well <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>. Usage of b 0 -specific antibodies in combination with rifampicin-chase selection allows promoters of all types to be extracted. Considering all these realities, we conclude that both values of R are rather high.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Promoter 'islands' have unusual functional features</head><p>The shape of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 6A</ref> reveals 2106 outliers with lower than expected hybridization signals (red symbols), which can not be attributed to experimental or technical errors, since oligonucleotide probes to the same genomic regions in the other ChIP-on-chip data set also tend to weaker hybridization ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 6B</ref>). This phenomenon can not be also explained by repressor functioning since the percentage of probes representing genes with inhibited transcription (22%) among these outlying probes approximately equals the percentage (25%) of such genes in the genome [RegulonDB 5.5 <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(38)</ref>]. Further analysis showed that almost all out-of-ordered probes correspond to regions with multiple promoter-like sites and every one of 78 promoter 'islands' turned out to be represented in the prominent part of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 6A</ref>. They comprise 32% of all the deviating probes, rather than 0.7% expected by chance. R H and R R for promoter 'islands' are low: 0.09 and 0.17, respectively. Thus, it appears that polymerase recognizes any single promoter-like site within the region of multiple competing promoters with less predictable efficiency than across the whole genome. High density of promoter-like sites tends to weaken rather than strengthen RNAPol binding.</p><p>To explore further this phenomenon a set of 181 known promoters accurately recognized in silico and possessing no more than two additional PlatProm signal(s) on either strand in a AE50 bp area was compiled (Supplementary <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>). Amid others it contains promoters P fadB , P cusC , and P cusR <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Figures 2 and 4</ref>). Only 21 promoters from this set contribute to the population of 2106 outlying probes by 42 representatives, which is exactly as much as expected by chance ($2%). The set of 'normal' promoters was compared with 78 PIs in terms of RNAPol binding and transcription efficiency calculated as described in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 6</ref> legend <ref type="table">(Supplementary Tables 2 and 3</ref>, and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 6C</ref>). All PIs and 87% of 'normal' promoters <ref type="table">(Supplementary  Tables 2 and 3</ref>) form complexes with RNAPol. At the same time RNA synthesis has been detected for 107 'normal' promoters (59%) but only for 20 out of 156 (78 Â 2) genomic loci flanking promoter 'islands' (13%).  Since blue outliers in the second data set tend to fit better to the expected range of log 2 ratios, this slight deviation was not considered as regular and was not further analyzed. Points representing promoter 'islands' 1-3 ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 4B)</ref> are shown in green. The indicated values of R were quantified for the whole set of microarray probes using (log 2 ) B and P averaged within running window 3. (C) Correlation between RNAPol binding (log 2 ) B and expression (log 2 ) E efficiencies plotted for 78 PIs (red symbols) and 181 single promoters (blue symbols).

(Log 2 ) E was first quantified as an average log 2 ratio of chip signals obtained upon cDNA hybridization with 10 probes representing the 250-bp region downstream from the last predicted TSP on each strand.

Other variants of (log 2 ) E calculation see in <ref type="table">Supplementary Table 2</ref>. (Log 2 ) B and (log 2 ) E for 'normal' promoters were quantified within 250 bp region upstream and downstream from the position +1, respectively (Supplementary <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>Comprehensive annotation of newly sequenced genomes implying mapping of genes along with their regulatory elements is currently becoming a long-term strategy appealing for effective promoter-finders. In the case of genes encoding proteins, rRNAs and tRNAs, which by itself are accurately identified by almost perfectly attuned computer programs, promoter-finders may assist in localization of regulatory regions. In the case of genes encoding small untranslated RNAs they are used to point out positions where sRNAs may be initiated <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39)</ref>, whereas other programs classify potential products as putative sRNAs based on their thermodynamic features and folding propensity. In the case of aRNAs promoter-finders may provide unique indicators of potential antisense transcription. So far only two dozens of aRNAs at least partly synthesized from the antisense strands of other genes have been found in E. coli. This rather small number apparently does not reflect their multiplicity, as genome-wide expression studies registered a huge amount of RNAs generated from antisense strands <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref>; PlatProm predicted many potential promoters for antisense transcription, while ChIP-on-chip technique detected suitable intragenic RNAPol-binding sites <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13)</ref>. Even though many signals registered by microarrays may result from run-through transcripts unterminated at 3 0 -ends of neighboring genes, some promoters predicted in silico may be false positives while intragenic RNAPol-binding sites may represent paused elongation complexes, combined data vote for antisense transcription in bacteria.</p><p>Along with potential TSPs for antisense transcription our screen revealed a large number of intragenic promoters with sense orientation and preferred location near the initiating codon. Though expediency of alternative transcription remains vague, very similar phenomenon has been recently registered in eukaryotic genomes [see, e.g. ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(40)</ref>]. In the chromosome of E. coli, there are several pairs of extensively overlapping genes encoding two proteins or a protein and an untranslated RNA. Many of them may be transcribed from common promoters. However genes hokC, tpr and ygeN with 5 0 -ends mapped within mokC, rttR and ygeO, respectively, as well as 46 transcripts partly matching sense strand and detected in the fraction of short RNAs by Vogel et al. (31) may be also initiated from their own promoters predicted by PlatProm. Internal promoters with sense orientation may, thus, mark candidates for alternative transcription.</p><p>The data obtained drew attention to 78 regions with high density of TSPs over long distance. Fifty-five of them at least partly overlap with intergenic loci presumed to contain active promoters, nine of which are mapped experimentally. They initiate RNA synthesis from single or several (up to eight) positions. Multiplicity of the TSPs might, therefore, be exploited by transcription machinery. Four promoter-rich clusters lie between convergently transcribed genes like in the case of appY/ompT ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 4B</ref>). Their transcription activity, if detected, assumes either presence of yet unidentified genes in intergenic regions or antisense transcription in one or both directions. Putative sRNA IS021 <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(39)</ref>, for instance, may be synthesized between appY and ompT, while gene for sRNA HB_171 is predicted between ygcE and ygcF <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29)</ref>. The most interesting are the remaining 19 PIs either immersed into one coding sequence or covering the junction point between two operonic genes, where promoter activity is not required.</p><p>Even though all 78 promoter 'islands' bind RNAPol in vivo, transcription has been detected for only 13 genomic loci ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 6C)</ref>. In all but one case (PI submerged into the wbbK coding sequence) they occupy intergenic regions. PI1 ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 4B</ref>) exemplifies cluster with weak expression observed in only one experiment (Supplementary <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>). Our data show that RNAPol can interact with PI1 and initiate RNA synthesis in both directions in vitro but primer extension ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 5E</ref>) failed to reveal the presence of appY-mRNA among RNAs produced in vivo. This transcriptional silence makes the value of R between promoter scores within PIs and corresponding (log 2 ) E statistically insignificant, whereas faint correlation between these parameters was registered for the subset of 'normal' promoters (0.16) and even the whole set of predicted promoter-like regions (0.075). That means that the overall transcription from multiple TSPs does not represent the sum of expected outputs from individual ones. Some sites seem to bind RNAPol without initiating productive synthesis, thus performing only part of functions commonly ascribed to promoter regions. If so, they may be considered as a kind of suppressor elements.</p><p>Currently it is not clear whether promoter 'islands' found in this study and 'clusters with high density of promoter-like signals' (1,36) reflect one and the same phenomenon. Previously discovered clusters are defined as accessories of intergenic loci, surrounding functional promoters and participating in their proper regulation, while 23 PIs ($30%) are located far from expected promoters. Ninety-two percent of E. coli genes have promoters surrounded by other promoter-like signals <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(36)</ref>. This clustering, thus, should be considered as a feature typical for E. coli genes, while 'single' promoters should be ranked as a peculiarity. At the same time only 78 regions have extremely high density of potential TSPs assuming their special role in genome organization and function. Since DNA of all but three PIs has high potentiality to undergo stress-induced deformations [(10); http://www .genomecenter.ucdavis.edu/benham/sidd_database/], there is a reason to suggest a possibility that PIs participate in structural remodeling of bacterial chromosome.</p><p>Our conclusions were drawn on the basis of comparative analysis of data sets obtained in silico and in vivo. Although both methods have certain limitations if used separately, together they provide valid information on the genome positioning of RNAPol-binding sites and allow spotting a larger set of potential promoters. Thus, even weak binding signals associated with a predicted TSP may indicate the presence of an active promoter, whereas complex formation with the enzyme nearby low scoring promoters supports their functionality. Moreover, the combined use of two approaches allows mapping of all types of transcribed regions including those encoding untranslated RNA species, hardly identifiable by other computational screens.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>) and algorithm developed by Huerta and Collado-Vides (1) predicts fadB promoter $150 bp upstream of the real TSP [see Figure 4 in (1)].</figDesc></figure>
