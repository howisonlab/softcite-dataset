				<p>The evolution and outcomes of conflicts in Europe, including the current one in Ukraine, have been influenced by the dynamics of economic, technological and military balances, which in turn are affected by the economic warfare and sanctions that have been used to alter them. This article reviews defence economic concepts of relevance to the Ukraine conflict and then draws out lessons for the present concerning power balances, military capabilities, conventional deterrence, economic warfare and countermeasures against sanctions from experiences in Europe in the twentieth century. An evaluation is made of the impacts of economic sanctions on Russia and Ukraine in 2014-2016.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Over the past century European security has been strongly influenced by the dynamics of economic and military power, as well as by the use of economic warfare and sanctions to alter the balances between adversaries. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> The evolution of the Ukraine conflict and its outcomes during 2014-2016 are consistent with this rule, in that they have been affected by the performances of the Russia and Ukraine economies, resource-driven changes in Russia-NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organisation) conventional forces, imbalances between Russia and Ukraine in military capabilities, and energetic efforts to use economic sanctions to influence opponents. However, the defence economic dimension of the Ukraine crisis has been relatively neglected.</p><p>The objectives of this article are to draw lessons from the defence economic history of Europe over the past century in order to address the following questions: what levels of resource commitments were required of NATO countries and the USSR to generate the military power that ensured nuclear and conventional deterrence in Europe in the Cold War period? What have been the unique defence economic institutions and policies that have enabled the USSR and Russia to produce military capabilities that have appeared to be more substantial than warranted by their economic power? Did the policies of national governments in Europe to achieve financial 'peace dividends' in the post-Cold War period adversely affect NATO's conventional military capabilities and thereby its deterrence of Russian actions related to Ukraine? Have the dynamics of economic, technological and military balances influenced the general developments in security in Europe and the genesis of the Ukraine conflict? Did Western economic warfare and sanctions directed at the USSR/ Russia over the period 1917-2013 achieve established goals concerning the alteration of economic and military power balances? What have been the economic and military impacts on Russia of Ukraine-related economic sanctions during 2014-2016?</p><p>The analysis is divided into two inter-related components, both covering the period 1917-2016. The first is concerned with the assessment of: the organisation and performance of the defence sectors in the economies of the USSR and Russia; trends in defence capabilities, economic and military balances, and conventional deterrence in Europe; the adequacy of resources allocated to support NATO, including its expansion in the 2000s; and comparison of the economic power and military capabilities of Russia and Ukraine in 2013-2016. The second section evaluates the causes and features of Western economic warfare directed at the USSR/Russia, as well as Russian responses and economic results in the periods <ref type="bibr">1917-1945, 1945-1991 and 1992-2013</ref>. it then describes Western economic sanctions imposed on Russia in connection with the Ukraine conflict and assesses their economic, military and political impacts. The remainder of this introduction reviews concepts related to these main sections.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Generation of military power by the economy, military balances in Europe, and conventional deterrence</head><p>The concept of economic power of relevance to national security concerns what <ref type="bibr">Knorr (1957, p. 8)</ref> called 'economic defense potential' , which is determined by the volume and rate of growth of GDP, the structure and flexibility of output at the sector level, and capabilities in science and technology. Economic power is produced by an economic system that is governed by economic policies and functions in a multi-dimensional economic environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Gregory &amp; Stuart, 1999)</ref>. OECD/NATO countries have had competitive and open market economies, which over time have performed well at macro and micro levels in the generation of economic power. in contrast, the USSR/CMEA countries had centralised, state-owned, planned and closed economies. These developed the characteristics of a 'shortage economy' , which generated rapid extensive economic growth but inhibited efficiency and technological progress <ref type="bibr">(Davis &amp; Charemza, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Kornai, 1980</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Kornai, , 1992</ref>. Following the collapse of the communist/ command systems in Europe, all countries engaged in the processes of economic transition. Those in East Europe and the Baltic region made rapid progress to market economies and joined the EU. But Russia, Ukraine and other states that emerged from the USSR developed hybrid economic systems (part market, part state) that performed poorly in the 1990s.</p><p>The Soviet economy had obvious formal features (planning, price controls, state monopoly of foreign trade), but also had six important 'Hidden Processes' (HP) that influenced economic performance and have been carried over into the contemporary market economies of Russia and Ukraine: HP 1, indirect bureaucratic control <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Kornai, 1992)</ref>; HP 2, pervasive second economies with related corruption networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Davis, 1988)</ref>; HP 3, negative value added in industry (e.g. obsolete factories in East Ukraine) <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(McKinnon, 1991)</ref>; HP 4, a 'Rent Management System' (RMS) that involves the state redistributing the value obtained from energy exports through formal and informal channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Gaddy &amp; ickes, 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Gaddy &amp; ickes, , 2010</ref>; HP 5, 'implicit' subsidisation of allied East European states (e.g. low oil prices in trade with CMEA countries) <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Marrese &amp; vanous, 1983)</ref>; and HP 6, illegal acquisition of restricted foreign technologies (CiA (US Central intelligence Agency), 1985). 2 in this article references will be made to the HP numbers as these processes are discussed.</p><p>The inter-relationships between economic power and military developments in Europe have been studied thoroughly over the centuries <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Goodwin, 1991)</ref>. in his 1878 publication Anti-Dühring <ref type="bibr">Engels (1970, pp. 184-185 cited in</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Davis, 1991a)</ref> wrote: … the triumph of force is based on the production of arms, and this in turn on production in general -therefore on 'economic power' , on the 'economic order' , on the material means which force has at its disposal … Nothing is more dependent on economic pre-conditions than precisely the army and navy.</p><p>Similar points were made by Lenin and early Soviet defence economists <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Davis, 1991a)</ref>. During World War ii all major countries not only studied the problem of how to convert economic power into military capabilities, but also implemented policies in their war economies to accomplish this, with varying degrees of success. in the post-war period <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Knorr (1957</ref><ref type="bibr">Knorr ( , p. 7, 1973</ref> argued that 'defense potential' was dependent not only on economic power, but also on the efficiency of the utilisation of resources devoted to defence (organisational ability) and on the 'will to provide for military power' (e.g. share of GDP devoted to defence). Studies of economic power and security have been continued up to the present <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Fels, Kremer, &amp; Kronenberg, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Military capabilities are determined not only by the general conversion of economic power to defence potential, but also by the performance of the defence sector, which is made up of six economic institutions (armed forces, defence industry, defence supply (logistics), military R&amp;D, military foreign trade, and the central defence bureaucracy) that function in specific economic systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Davis, 1990b</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Davis, , 2002</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Pozharov (1981, pp. 116-117)</ref> describes the interconnection as follows:</p><p>in order for economic power to be converted into military strength, it is necessary to provide for the production of armaments, combat technology and other items of a military nature, the correct distribution and timely delivery of them to the troops, and the creation of all the conditions for their effective utilization. A special social organism serves these goals -the military economy. The scale and effectiveness of the military economy characterizes the military-economic power of the state, that is, its actual capability to provide its armed forces and to support the necessary defensive capacity of the country.</p><p>in the case of the USSR, the defence sector was given a high priority status within the planned economy, which meant that it benefited from the preferential allocation of scarce resources and from the establishment of special organisations (e.g. the Military-industrial Commission) to ensure the accomplishment of the national security objectives of the state. Aspects of Soviet defence organisation have been maintained in the Russian Federation <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Davis, 2002)</ref>.</p><p>Government policy makers take into account external and domestic threats (military, economic, political) when developing a national security strategy that includes both threat reduction programmes (diplomatic, propaganda, arms control, espionage) and the military capabilities generated by the defence sector <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Davis, 1986a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Davis, , 1986b</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Davis, , 1992</ref>. in the case of the USSR, the strategy of the Brezhnev regime placed heavy emphasis on military power, whereas the Gorbachev government shifted it to threat reduction (see quotation on p. 6). in the Russian Federation, the government of Yeltsin placed less emphasis on military power than has that of Putin.</p><p>A final concept used in this study concerns the impacts on nations of the relative dynamics of economic, technological and military balances. <ref type="bibr">3</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Kennedy (1988)</ref> argued that the rises and declines of major countries, empires and alliances in Europe in the twentieth century were strongly influenced by shifts in these balances and that an important skill in statecraft in the economic sphere is the maintenance of an appropriate distribution of national income between consumption, investment and defence. The adverse impacts of a sustained heavy defence burden on the USSR are evaluated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Davis (1990a)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Goals and features of economic warfare and sanctions</head><p>Economic warfare (including specific economic sanctions) is intended primarily to influence economic, technology and military power balances to the advantage of the country/alliance conducting it. Punitive measures can relate to trade in commodities (embargo, denial of 'Most-Favoured Nation' (MFN) status, refusal of export licences, preclusive buying) and finance (freezing of assets, restrictions on lending, expropriation of property) <ref type="bibr">(Baldwin, 1985, p. 41)</ref>. Even in periods with no overt economic warfare, countries that are leaders in technology maintain controls on exports that concern both the features of technologies (e.g. advanced encryption) and potential recipient countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Joyner, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kabrt &amp; Jung, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">MacDaniel, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr">Rode &amp; Jacobsen, 1985)</ref>.</p><p>in this article economic warfare (including sanctions) is interpreted as a politico-economic process with a beginning, an end, and the following features in between: EWF (Economic Warfare Feature) 1, trigger (cause); EWF 2, establishment of objectives <ref type="bibr">(economic, military, political)</ref>; EWF 3, agreement on conditions for termination; EWF 4, decisions on specific measures (e.g. restrictions on trade and finance); EWF 5, comprehensiveness of participation; EWF 6, commitment to implementation (e.g. rigorous or symbolic); EWF 7, effectiveness of counter-measures; EWF 8, evaluation of impacts; and EWF 9, removal of restrictions/sanctions. These nine features are discussed throughout the historical periods examined in the second section of this article, including the one related to the Ukraine conflict. Elements of this process (trigger, measures, counter-measures, economic impacts) are summarised in three historical tables covering Western economic warfare (sanctions) directed against the USSR/Russia during 1917-1945 <ref type="table">(Table 6)</ref>,   <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">(Table 7)</ref> and 1992-2016 <ref type="table">(Table  8)</ref>.

Following the victory Lenin recognised the economic weakness of the revolutionary nation and introduced the New Economic Policy in the 1920s to stimulate an economic recovery and ease domestic political tensions. Although the large Red Army was demobilised and much of the defence industry was converted to civilian production, the government understood the importance of providing a strong economic foundation for the military power of the socialist state in a threatening world <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Davis, 1991a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Erickson, 1962;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Pozharov, 1981)</ref>. The adoption of the Stalinist economic programme, including the high priority status of defence, generated rapid industrialisation in the 1930s <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Davis, 1996)</ref>. This enabled the USSR to shift economic and military balances in its favour in peacetime and to convert quickly to a militarised economy during World War ii <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Harrison, 1985)</ref>.</p><p>The Soviet Union emerged victorious from World War ii, but its economy was severely damaged and its structure was distorted in favour of the military sector.

The index of USSR industrial production (1970=100.0) increased from 22.2 in 1950 to a peak of 189.1 in 1988 ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref>). Despite Western economic warfare, the Soviet Union became the dominant economic power in Europe. Although the USSR introduced numerous economic reforms, it retained an inefficient shortage economy that was characterised by decelerating GDP growth and sluggish technological innovation <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Ellman &amp; Kontorovich, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Gregory &amp; Stuart, 2001)</ref>.</p><p>Soviet hard-currency trade through its state monopoly expanded dramatically in the 1970s because of increases in world market prices for energy and in exports of oil and gas: energy earnings rose from $388 million in 1970 to $18,865 million in 1984. The government made use of its evolving 'Rent Management System' (RMS) (HP 4) to redistribute the growing energy 'rent' (value) to finance imports, to support the defence effort, and to subsidise inefficient enterprises (HP 3) and East European countries (HP 5) <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Davis, 2014a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Gaddy &amp; ickes, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Marrese &amp; vanous, 1983)</ref>.    <ref type="bibr">1950</ref><ref type="bibr">. source: Davis (1999</ref>.</p><p>OECD economies grew at healthy rates <ref type="bibr">during 1950-1973, experienced 'stagflation' in 1974-1980</ref> due to oil price shocks, and then entered a period of sustained growth.

The allocation of resources to the defence sector rose substantially and by the 1980s the defence burden was around 15% of GDP. The increases in the armed forces and deployed weapons are shown in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>.

This required substantial commitments of resources to defence: USA 6% of GDP, UK 5%, France 4% and Germany 3%. Although there were tensions in Europe during 1945-1989, there were no armed conflicts or changes in international borders. The USA did not recognise the 1940 annexations of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, but it treated this as a side-issue in order to manage its relations with the USSR for the sake of global stability. 5 <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Declines in the economic and military power of Russia and Ukraine in the 1990s</head><p>Russia and Ukraine emerged as independent states in 1991 with similar inheritances of a malfunctioning shortage economy with newly revealed negative value-added components (HP 3) and the common challenge of establishing a market system in difficult politico-economic circumstances. Due to the weakness of the state in Russia there was a break-down in the priority protection system and in central control of the RMS (HP 4), which had less rent (value) to distribute because of low energy prices ($22 per barrel). initial macroeconomic stabilisation efforts failed in both countries, which resulted in 40% declines in GDP and high inflation (EBRD (European Bank for Reconstruction and Development), 1994 … 1999). Microeconomic processes were dominated by barter between firms, build-ups of informal inter-enterprise debt, pervasive second economy activity and corruption (HP 2), ineffective privatisation, limited industrial restructuring, and little FDi (see Note 10). By the mid-1990s Russia had a 'virtual economy' in which the state pretended to promote market-oriented reform while using the RMS to transfer value from the energy sector to negative value-added industries (HP 1, HP 3) in order to avoid mass bankruptcies and political unrest <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Gaddy &amp; ickes, 1998</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Gaddy &amp; ickes, , 2005</ref>. 7 in 1998 Russia experienced a new financial crisis due to its large budget deficits and debt (GKO) levels and a 50% drop in the price of oil to $11 per barrel.</p><p>Macroeconomic developments in Ukraine in the 1990s mirrored those in Russia. in the main industrialised region in East Ukraine the large Soviet-era firms were mostly unprofitable (HP 3), closely integrated with Russian ones, and supported by subsidies from Russia in the forms of low energy and raw material prices and guaranteed orders for products that were uncompetitive internationally (HP 5) <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Gaddy &amp; ickes, 2014a)</ref>. in contrast, OECD economies experienced healthy growth, and technological progress accelerated. The East Europe and Baltic countries engaged successfully with necessary reforms and their economies recovered quickly. So the gaps in economic power widened between Russia/Ukraine and important countries in the world.</p><p>Russia and Ukraine lowered the priorities of their military-industrial complexes and drastically reduced defence expenditures <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Davis, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr"></ref> international institute for Strategic Studies (iiSS), 1992 … 2000).

Negligible progress was achieved in defence-related reforms. in 1993 Ukraine agreed to give up its nuclear weapons and to lease military bases in Crimea to Russia in return for energy subsidies and guarantees of its territorial integrity. Although Russia and Ukraine moved apart in the political sphere, they remained closely integrated in defence industry and military R&amp;D <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Cooper, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>The effectiveness of NATO armies remained high and new military technologies were introduced (stealth design, smart bombs, drones). However, due to the widespread perception that there were no longer serious security threats in Europe, the NATO countries decided to obtain an economic 'peace dividend' by reducing defence expenditures, military personnel and weapon systems (see <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>). <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>.

Despite these cutbacks, NATO engaged in bombing campaigns in 1995 in Bosnia-Herzogovina (against Bosnian Serb forces in the civil war) and in 1999 in Serbia (related to Kosovo). These actions were strongly opposed by Russia. in 1999 the membership of NATO was expanded to include Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland.</p><p>in the post-Cold War period through 2013 there was significant instability of the borders of countries in Europe with a total of 30 alterations.

Three states achieved independence following wars: Serbia-Montenegro, Bosnia-Herzogovina and Croatia. in five other cases regions of a state with an aggrieved ethnic minority achieved autonomy through armed conflict with the support of a foreign power, and thereafter entered the category of 'frozen conflict <ref type="bibr">': Transdniestria (1992)</ref>, South Ossetia (1992), Abkhazia (1993), <ref type="bibr">Nagorno-Karabakh (1994)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Kosovo (1999)</ref>.

But it increased in real ($2011) terms from a low $2.4 billion to $4.4 billion. The number of troops was reduced from 303,800 to 130,000 and MB tanks from 3895 to 1110 <ref type="table">(Table 2</ref>). The malfunctioning of the Ukraine economy and the disregard of the military by successive governments meant that in 2013 the armed forces suffered from low pay and poor conditions for officers and men, obsolete weapons, and inadequate training.</p><p>in the 2000s NATO continued to withdraw conventional forces from forward-operating bases.

From 1993 to 2013 the number of combat aircraft in France was cut from 630 to 290. NATO defence spending rose after 11 September 2001, but most of the increment was devoted to War on Terror operations outside of Europe (iraq, Afghanistan).

NATO also proceeded with the development of a missile defence system in Europe. This was strongly opposed by Russia, which withdrew from the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty in 2007 in retaliation. Overall, the sustained reductions in military expenditure and armed forces by NATO countries during 1991-2013 undermined conventional deterrence in Europe. <ref type="bibr">11</ref> Over this period NATO countries also significantly scaled back intelligence efforts focussed on Russia (CiA/DiA in the USA and Mi6/Ministry of Defence in the UK), and redeployed experienced analysts with Russia/Ukraine area knowledge and language capabilities to the War on Terror in the Middle East and South Asia. in 2011-2012 the USA announced that it would be making a major shift in its strategic focus away from peaceful Europe to the Asia-Pacific region to deal with new threats.</p><p>During 2000-2013 the USA augmented its poor record of supplying weapons to weak armed forces that either allowed weapons to be stolen on a large scale or were defeated and surrendered supplies to US opponents: Afghanistan army 2001 ongoing (to the Taleban); iraq army 2003-2010 (to Shia and Sunni insurgents); Georgia army 2008 (to Russia); iraq army 2014 (to iSiS); Syria democratic forces 2015 (US anti-tank weapons to al-Nusra Front); and Yemen army 2015 (much of the $500 million in US military aid to al-Houthi and al-Qaeda rebels) <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(Whitlock, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>With respect to the military balance in Europe in 2013, both NATO and Russia had reduced numbers of personnel and weapons compared to 2000.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Defence-economic aspects of the conflict in Ukraine 2013-2015</head><p>The evolution, features and consequences of the Ukraine conflict have been fully documented elsewhere (e.g. UK House of Lords, 2015) and are only briefly reviewed below. This section focuses on the interconnections between economic and military developments in Ukraine and Russia. The crisis grew out of the need by Ukraine to obtain external support for its faltering economy either from the EU/iMF (requiring wide-ranging reforms and a Greece-style austerity programme) or from Russia as a reward for participating in the new EEU. The decision by President Yanukovich in Autumn 2013 to pursue the latter course provoked the Maidan protest movement <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Gaddy &amp; ickes, 2014a)</ref>. The government found that it had to rely primarily upon the highly-paid riot police (Berkut) in controlling the increasingly violent political dispute because the ordinary police had divided loyalties and the underfunded armed forces made it clear that they would not get involved in an armed conflict involving Ukrainian citizens. Following the overthrow of the President in February 2014, the interim government reversed foreign economic policies to favour the EU and expressed an interest in joining NATO <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Gaddy &amp; ickes, 2014c)</ref>. in response to these political changes and the growing problems in the economy, the iMF (international Monetary Fund), EC (European Commission) and USA have been providing Ukraine with substantial financial assistance, which is linked to economic reform and austerity programmes. <ref type="bibr">12</ref> Russia disapproved of the revolutionary changes in Ukraine and perceived a risk that it would lose its important military bases in Crimea, which give it access through the Black Sea to the Mediterranean Sea (e.g. for naval transport of weapons systems and ammunition to Syria). Since the bilateral economic and military balances were in Russia's favour <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">(Table 5)</ref> and conventional deterrence of NATO had degraded <ref type="table">(Table 2)</ref>, it implemented a covert operation to take control of Crimea that was effective because competent non-violent actions by pro-Russia units and Russian special forces were backed by the implicit threat of decisive military intervention by Russia.</p><p>During Spring 2014 the insurrections by pro-Russian forces in East Ukraine (Luhansk, Donetsk) received hidden assistance from Russia <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Allison, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">iiSS, 2014</ref><ref type="bibr">iiSS, , 2015</ref>. in June the Ukraine government attempted to re-establish control in East Ukraine by sending in its armed forces (supplemented by nationalist militias), despite the weaknesses of the army (e.g. poor training and equipment, limited counter-insurgency skills), lack of international military support, superior Russian military capabilities, and the demonstration in Crimea that Russia was prepared to intervene militarily. The attempted re-occupation of East Ukraine was resisted successfully by the pro-Russian insurgents during two phases of war, but the conflict resulted in heavy civilian casualties because both sides used artillery, tanks, mortars and rockets in fighting in villages and cities. The armed combat was ended in February 2015 by the Minsk ii Agreement and a relatively stable truce existed throughout the remainder of the year and into early 2016.</p><p>in response to the annexation of Crimea, the war in the eastern regions and the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, economic sanctions were imposed on Russia by foreign countries, which are discussed in the next section. NATO has supplemented these sanctions with military ones. in recognition of the erosion over the past two decades of the conventional deterrence provided by NATO in Europe, the USA and UK have redeployed troops, tanks and aircraft to 'front-line states' (notably the Baltic countries) for military exercises and border patrols. Several NATO countries have provided the Ukrainian armed forces with military trainers and non-lethal military supplies. A couple of NATO European countries have made commitments to raise defence spending to the agreed low level of 2% of GDP.</p><p>A controversial issue debated during 2014-2015 was whether or not NATO should directly provide weapons and military equipment to Ukraine. The poor performances of the Ukraine armed forces in the two active phases of the war reflected the sustained neglect of them by successive governments. Some pro-Ukraine politicians and security analysts in the West argued in favour of such supplies in order to turn the tide of battle. However, the prevailing opinion was that the current imbalance of military power in Ukraine in favour of the insurgents in the eastern regions and Russia could not be changed in the short-term by foreign powers providing more sophisticated weapons to Ukraine. Evidence was provided earlier in this article concerning the record of the repeated failures of the USA in supplying weapons to weak governments with poorly performing armies (see pp. 7 and 12). it has been clear that the armed forces of Ukraine would require extended intensive training before they could handle some of the systems (e.g. the AN/TPQ-53 mobile anti-artillery radar system) being proposed by supporters of arms supplies. Other drawbacks to this interventionist policy were the comprehensive penetration of Ukraine government organisations by Russian intelligence and Russian escalation dominance in conventional weapons <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Allison &amp; Simes, 2015)</ref>. Taking these factors into account, NATO probably was correct in deciding to not provide weapons directly to Ukraine during 2014-2015 <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Monaghan, 2015)</ref>.</p></div>

All important industrialised countries participated in these restrictions on trade and finance (EWF 5), which remained in effect to a diminishing degree until the end of the Cold War. Supplemental sanctions were introduced in response to unacceptable actions by the USSR (e.g. 1956 suppression of the uprising in Hungary, 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia).</p><p>Three cases of Cold War anti-Soviet economic sanctions have relevance to the current Ukraine crisis.

Some categories of technologies were not approved for export to Russia in the 1990s. Although the justification for the 1974 Jackson-Vanik Amendment had disappeared completely, the US Congress would not agree to its repeal due to anti-Russia sentiments, which meant that the Executive Branch (US President) had to grant Russia an annual waiver for it to obtain MFN status (EWF 3 End Conditions).</p><p>As in the past, Russia attempted to circumvent foreign controls on technologies of relevance to its defence efforts using a re-organised Spetsinformatsiya system (HP 6). The main agencies involved were the Ministry of Defence GRU and the successor to the foreign arm of the KGB, the SVR (Sluzhba Vneshnei Razvedki), notably its Directorate X: Scientific and Technical Intelligence. However, technological acquisition operations were adversely affected in the 1990s by political changes in Russia (the shift to a democratic political system and an initial pro-West foreign policy) and tight budget constraints due to the collapse of the economy.</p><p>The USA intensified its controls on exports of military and dual-use technologies post-'9/11' <ref type="table">(Table 8)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">15</ref> Due to the military build-up by Russia in the 2000s and the worsening of bilateral relations, these controls increasingly inhibited high-technology trade between the two countries. The Jackson-Vanik Amendment was repealed in 2012 (this was necessary for legal reasons because of Russia's entry to the WTO), but it was replaced by the Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act of 2012, which imposed sanctions (visa bans, freezing of assets) on Russian government officials who had been involved in the maltreatment of the Russian anti-corruption lawyer (this relates to EWF 3 on the difficulty in establishing End Conditions).</p><p>Russia imposed restrictions on its own exports and imports from the West, such as its fivemonth ban in 2010 on the import of poultry products from the USA (with a value of $760 million in 2009), ostensibly because of health risks (EWF 7 Counter-measures). Throughout the 2000s Russian intelligence agencies (GRU, SVR) made efforts to obtain controlled military and dual-use technologies in the OECD countries and achieved some successes (HP 6).</p><p>in sum, the West continued to control high-technology trade with Russia in the post-communist period and to maintain various outmoded sanctions (notably Jackson-Vanik). But these measures were fragmented and unevenly enforced across the Western alliance, and offset to some extent by Russian counter-measures. As a result, the impacts of Western economic warfare/sanctions on the economic and military power of the Russian Federation during 1992-2013 were rather minor compared to those of other determinants (e.g. world market price of oil).</p></div>

Two features of anti-Russia economic sanctions have undermined their effectiveness: participation and outsourcing. The sanctions have had the support of important countries with a collective GDP of US$42.5 trillion. However, <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">Table 9</ref> shows that seven major industrial countries (Brazil, China, india, indonesia, iran, South Korea and Turkey) with collective GDP of US$31.5 trillion declined to participate. This indicates that there is a major problem with EWF 5 (Comprehensiveness) in that current sanctions are much leakier than the marginally effective ones of the Cold War CoCom period. <ref type="bibr">17</ref> The second problem is that NATO countries have transferred much of their electronic and high-technology production to lower wage non-participating countries, unlike in the more controlled Cold War period. <ref type="bibr">18</ref> This globalisation of defence production and procurement has facilitated Russian trade diversion and covert acquisition of technology (EWF 7, HP 6).</p><p>A global development that amplified the effects of anti-Russia sanctions was the coincidental drop in the world market price of oil (OPEC crude oil basket) from $115 per barrel in June 2014 to $50 in January 2015 and around $31 in January 2016. This external shock lowered Russia's dollar earnings from energy exports, which weakened the financial positions of its banks, businesses and government. Russia has been able to use its RMS (HP 4) and substantial stabilisation funds (the Reserve Fund and Sovereign Wealth Fund), that were developed from past high taxation on energy exports, to buffer the adverse impacts of sanctions on the population, corporations and the financial sector. But the lower oil price has reduced revenue flows through the RMS and prevented the replenishment of the stabilisation funds.</p><p>The Russian government has responded to sanctions by adopting numerous counter-measures (EWF 7). With respect to Ukraine, it imposed restrictions on exports of agricultural and industrial goods to Russia, cut energy subsidies and demanded pre-payment of gas supplies. <ref type="bibr">19</ref> it banned imports of food from the countries imposing sanctions and made efforts to find alternative suppliers in non-participating nations. in March 2015 Russia prohibited Western iT firms based in Russia from bidding for state contracts (about 70% of their in-country revenue) if they are observing Western restrictions on doing business in Crimea. in November 2015 the Russian government required all state agencies to purchase Russian-sourced software (e.g. for spreadsheets) instead of foreign products (e.g. Excel) from the start of 2016. in an unrelated action, but one relevant to this article, Russia imposed economic sanctions on Turkey (restrictions of charter flights for tourists, removal of visa-free travel, suspension of investment projects, a ban on hiring Turkish citizens) in late November 2015 in response to the Turkish air force using a US-supplied F-16 to shoot down a Russian bomber engaged in ground attacks against Turkomen insurgents in north Syria (BBC, 2015). Several Russian government import-substitution policies have been supported by large budget allocations. Russia proceeded with the formation of the EEU in January 2015 with the other member states of Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. Russian institutions have explored options for obtaining substitute finance in alternative financial centres in Asia (Singapore, Hong Kong, Shanghai). However, according to Connolly (2015b) Asia was the source of only 10% of loans to Russian businesses in 2015. in light of the Western embargo on exports of military equipment (e.g. helicopter carriers from France), Russia has been moving back toward self-sufficiency in defence. it has revived aspects of the priority protection system in the economy, as indicated by President Putin becoming Head of the State Commission for Military-Industrial Issues in September 2014 (see <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>). Russia has re-energised its Spetsinformatsiya system and relevant institutions are engaged in trade diversion and in the covert acquisition of banned technologies and finance (EWF 7).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Economic and military impacts of Western and Russian economic sanctions related to the Ukraine conflict, 2014-2016</head><p>Developments in the economy of Russia in 2014-2015 were mainly negative <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">(Table 3)</ref>: deceleration of GDP growth to -3.8%; acceleration of inflation to 15.5%; increase in the budget deficit; wide-ranging budget cuts (usually 10%); rises in interest rates to a peak of 17%; a 40% year-on-year depreciation of the ruble-dollar exchange rate; large outflows of capital; higher risk premiums on bonds; and increases in unemployment and poverty (EBRD, 2015; iMF, 2015a, 2015c; RF MER (Russian Federation, Ministerstvo Ekonomicheskogo Razvitiya), 2015; World Bank, 2015b, 2015c). 20 in the positive category were the substantial surplus in the current account (7% of GDP), increases of import substitution production in Russian industry and agriculture, and a sharp reduction in the external debt (to 29% of GDP). Forecasts of economic growth in 2016 were revised downward by the World Bank (to -0.7%) in December 2015 and the RF Ministry for Economic Development (to -0.8%) in January 2016, primarily due to lower than anticipated world oil prices <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Prokopenko, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">World Bank, 2015d)</ref>.</p><p>Numerous publications have claimed that the worsening economic situation in Russia has provided proof that the sanctions have been achieving their objectives. However, it is almost impossible to measure the economic impacts of sanctions because of the disruption caused by the drop in oil prices and lack of information of the effectiveness of Russian counter-measures. The World <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Bank (2015b)</ref> presented an interesting analysis of this topic, but it had weaknesses concerning sources and methods, and almost every tentative conclusion had several qualifications following it. 21 in assessing the macroeconomic impacts of sanctions on Russia, the counter-factual of the oil price not falling should be considered. if Russia had continued to receive payments of $115 per barrel from June 2014, then it is likely that many of the negative phenomena in the Russian economy (capital outflows, exchange rate depreciation, low FDi, negative growth, diminished stabilisation funds) would not have developed, even with sanctions. in reality the oil price did drop, so sanctions must be assessed in conjunction with the decline in Russia's hard-currency energy earnings. <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">Table 10</ref> summarises the impacts of sanctions on economic, military and political processes in Russia.</p><p>The sanctions imposed on individuals in Crimea, Eastern Ukraine and Russia deny them visas and freeze their overseas assets. But many of these people come from modest socio-economic backgrounds and would not have had external passports, foreign banks accounts or plans to travel abroad. Bans on Russian state officials are largely irrelevant because their own government has prohibited them (and close family members for security services employees) from having foreign bank accounts and has restricted their travel abroad in order to fight corruption and counteract the subversive efforts of foreign espionage agencies. However, the restrictions on business transactions with firms of wealthy Russians have caused some serious local complications. Overall, the targeted individual sanctions have had negligible macroeconomic, military or political impacts.</p><p>Strict controls have been imposed on transactions involving Crimea (exports, imports, investment, loans, business operations). These have had significant direct and indirect negative local effects, in that companies have withdrawn from Crimea (e.g. McDonalds of Ukraine), avoided investment there, and have suspended services (e.g. licences for computer games and software). However, the experienced and pervasive Russian/Ukrainian 'second economy' (HP 2) has provided substitutes ('pirate' copies) for some withdrawn goods and services that cannot be measured by international organisations or US government analysts in Washington, DC. Furthermore, countries not participating in sanctions, such as Turkey up to November 2015, have been active in capital investment projects in Crimea. However, the Russian government has been forced to make investments in Crimea or related to it (e.g. infrastructure, tourist facilities) that might have been financed externally in the absence of sanctions. <ref type="bibr">22</ref> The embargo on exports to Russia of weapons and military equipment has been effective in the official sphere. This has reduced Russia's spending on imports (e.g. warships from France), but has increased its investment in import substitution. Russia probably has acquired some smaller items of banned military equipment through trade diversion and military technologies (e.g. blueprints for reverse engineering) through economic espionage (EWF 7, HP 6). The sanctions have disrupted supply and production plans in the defence sector. The main political impact of these sanctions has been to encourage Russia to return to self-sufficiency in the defence field. Several assessments suggest that these compensatory efforts (e.g. substitution of defence-related imports from Ukraine) will meet with limited success in the short-term, but could pay off in the medium/long-term.</p><p>The bans on exports to Russia of dual-use and energy-related technologies have been partially successful in curtailing official trade in the specified commodities and services. But the economic impacts have been mitigated by stock-piling of the technologies in advance of the crisis and informal acquisition of them through trade diversion and technological espionage (HP 6). <ref type="bibr">23</ref> The Russian government, like other investors in the world, has delayed numerous capital investment projects (e.g. deep-sea drilling for oil) because of the low oil price, which has lowered the demand for the banned technologies. <ref type="bibr">24</ref> These sanctions have impelled the Russian government to promote self-sufficiency in energy technologies and to search for alternative trading partners in China, india and South Korea. By 2015 there was some evidence that economic sanctions were disrupting general scientific R&amp;D in Russia (e.g. Western firms refusing to export scientific equipment out of concern that it might be used in the military sphere), although most of the problems were caused by the depreciation of the ruble and international organisations responding of new Russian legislation restricting the activities of NGOs <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Dezhina, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>The financial sanctions have had negative impacts on the specifically targeted banks and firms (difficulties in obtaining new loans and rolling over existing ones) and indirect adverse consequences for other Russian firms because of uncertainty in markets. These restrictions have generated capital outflows because Russian firms have needed to convert ruble funds to cover foreign obligations and have reduced FDi in Russia (see Note 10). Some defence-related firms have found it impossible to pursue planned projects with foreign partners. However, the Russian government has assisted targets of sanctions and, in any event, much of Russian external debt obligations are with Russian entities (about one-half of repayments in 2015-2016) and can therefore be easily re-scheduled <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Connolly, 2015b)</ref>. Furthermore, informal channels (the well-documented Russian second economy) (HP 2) have been used to obtain financing in the complicated global financial system that has demonstrated clearly over the past five years that it cannot be regulated effectively by USA/ UK government agencies (e.g. uncontrolled sub-prime lending, tolerance of incompetent borrowing strategies of banks, fraudulent derivatives, cheating on LiBOR, swindling the population through unnecessary loan insurance, money laundering for drug cartels). it will be challenging for the hastily organised EU/USA compliance teams to ensure that financial sanctions are not comprehensively subverted by talented Russians working in the global financial sector and intelligence agencies. The most important impact of these Western financial sanctions probably has been to make the most market-oriented of Russian firms and banks become more dependent on the Russian state <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Gaddy &amp; ickes, 2014b)</ref>.</p><p>A final category of sanctions relates to exclusions of Russia from membership in international bodies (e.g. G8), as well as boycotts of events in Russia (e.g. vE Day celebrations). These symbolic gestures have not achieved the declared economic, military or political impacts. The Russian government initially responded by developing compensatory relationships with other major countries (e.g. the BRiCS). However, by the end of 2015 the terrorist actions of iSiS directed against France and Russia resulted in these two countries forming a tentative military alliance to combat the common terrorist threats.</p><p>The economy of Ukraine has performed poorly during 2014-2015 <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">(Table 3)</ref>, but Russian sanctions have made only minor contributions to this. Adverse macroeconomic developments have been caused primarily by the intensification of long-standing performance problems (low productivity, large budget deficits and external debts), weak economic institutions, deeply ingrained corruption (HP 2), the direct economic effects of the crisis (disruption of industrial production and tax collection in East Ukraine by war) and reactions of foreign investors to geopolitical risk (currency depreciation). The loss of Russian subsidies (HP 5) has been offset by the iMF/EU/USA, which have taken on long-term financial responsibility for propping up the malfunctioning economy of Ukraine on the condition of adherence to a package of deep reforms and restructuring and financial austerity similar to the one developed to deal with the debt crisis in Greece. it is possible, though, that a new round of bilateral sanctions in late 2015-early 2016 could cause greater problems for Ukraine in the future. These include Ukraine cutting off electricity supplies to Crimea, banning Russian airlines from flying through its airspace and restricting exports to Russia. in response Russia has banned additional Ukrainian imports, reduced deliveries of coal and natural gas, and refused to re-schedule bond repayments.</p><p>Russian counter-sanctions have had negligible macroeconomic effects on EU countries because the affected commodities (food products) comprise only small shares of exports. However, there have been some negative microeconomic impacts (e.g. the bans on the exports to Russia of fruit from Greece and cheese from Lithuania).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions concerning defence-economic influences on the Ukraine conflict and the impacts of economic sanctions</head><p>This concluding section focuses on developing answers to the questions posed in the introduction concerning defence economics and economic warfare. There is no elaboration of points previously made concerning the wisdom of EU and NATO expansion eastward, causation in the Ukraine political and military conflict, and the merits of supplying arms to Ukraine.</p><p>The first question concerns the commitments of resources made by both the USSR and NATO countries to achieve their security objectives and establish a military balance in Europe. Due to the traumatic experiences of World War ii, NATO countries and the USSR were committed to converting economic power into military capabilities and to maintaining combat readiness. These policies resulted in the USSR devoting around 15% of GDP to defence in the mid-1980s and in the leading NATO countries accepting relatively heavy defence burdens for democracies in peacetime: USA 6%, UK 5%, France 4% and Germany 3%. Although these military efforts strained economies (especially that of the USSR) and entailed significant opportunity costs, they contributed to peace in Europe, stability of borders, and nuclear and conventional deterrence.</p><p>The USSR economy was significantly smaller than those of its NATO adversaries and its technological level was lower. However, the Soviet Union developed a unique, insulated military economic system (central planning and rationing, high priority, technological espionage) that enabled it to mobilise its limited resources to become the dominant European industrial and military power <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 1, Table 2</ref>). However, the exceptionally heavy defence burden and well-known flaws in the general economic and political systems contributed to the collapse of the USSR. Most institutional features of the Soviet defence sector were carried over to the Russian Federation <ref type="figure">(Figure 2</ref>). However, in the 1990s the priority of the military-industrial complex declined and the armed forces, defence industry and military R&amp;D experienced severe economic difficulties. The situation changed for the better in the 2000s as a result of economic recovery and the raised priority of national security programmes. As in the past, the top leadership is closely involved in managing the military-industrial complex (e.g. President Putin is head of both the Security Council and the State Commission for Military-Industrial Issues). The conflicts during 2013-2016 in Ukraine and Syria demonstrate that the Russian economy can generate necessary military capabilities and that the leadership has the will to employ them.</p><p>The answer to the third question concerning the consequences of the sustained drive by national governments in Europe to achieve financial 'peace dividends' in the post-Cold War period is clear. The drastic cuts in defence spending, down to an average of 1.6% of GDP in NATO Europe, adversely affected NATO's conventional military capabilities and deterrence. This meant that Russia did not need to take NATO into account when it was formulating its military strategy to deal with the Ukraine crisis. The efforts by NATO to move troops and military equipment closer to Eastern borders have been justified on the basis that they will deter Russia from future aggressive actions against NATO members. During 2014-2016 only the UK and Poland were meeting the agreed NATO defence burdens target of 2%, although several other countries (e.g. Estonia) made commitments to reach that target by 2020 <ref type="bibr">(iiSS, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Over the past century the dynamics of economic, technological and military balances have helped to explain the rise and fall of nations and alliances. This was evident in the case of World War ii. in the Cold War period the NATO countries had greater economic power and a higher average technological level than the USSR, but for several decades the latter was able to achieve military balance through its defence economic arrangements. in the post-communist period the NATO countries have maintained their economic power and technological superiority. However, as a result of continued NATO cuts in defence spending and the increased Russian defence effort the balance of deployed conventional military capabilities in Europe shifted in favour of Russia. <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 5</ref> demonstrates that by 2013 Russia had overwhelming advantages over Ukraine in the local balance of economic and military power. These military imbalances contributed to Russia's annexation of Crimea and support for insurgents in eastern Ukraine.</p><p>The USA, Japan and European countries conducted economic warfare (supplemented by sanctions) against the USSR throughout 1917-1991 <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">(Tables 6 and 7)</ref>. However, there were recurrent disagreements between participants with respect to perceptions of triggers, objectives, termination conditions, and specific measures that limited the comprehensiveness of and commitments to economic warfare. The wide-ranging trade controls of CoCom achieved some successes. But the robust counter-measure Spetsinformatsiya system enabled the USSR to obtain controlled goods and secrets through trade diversion and technological espionage. <ref type="table">Table 8</ref> indicates that in the period 1992-2013 lower key and fragmented efforts were made by the West to control the flows of technology to Russia and to impose economic sanctions. These achieved some goals concerning specific products or sectors. Overall, the answer to question five is that Western economic warfare and sanctions directed at the USSR/Russia over the period 1917-2013 did not achieve intended ambitious objectives concerning the alteration of economic and military power balances, but did slow the development of the USSR into a superpower.</p><p>The final question concerns Ukraine-related economic sanctions during 2014-2016. The assessments in <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">Table 10</ref> suggest that the sanctions imposed on Russia (bans on individuals, prohibitions of transactions in Crimea, embargoes on exports of military goods and some energy-related technologies, and restrictions on the availability of finance) have had relatively minor impacts. The effectiveness of economic sanctions has been undermined by the limited participation by major economies <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">(Table 9)</ref>, restraints on the rigour of measures in order to maintain the USA-EU alliance, and the usual covert counter-measures by Russia. if world market prices of oil had not dropped by over 60% during 2014-2016, it is likely that anti-Russia sanctions would have had negligible macroeconomic impacts. But given actual economic developments, it is reasonable to conclude both that economic sanctions have imposed marginal microeconomic and macroeconomic costs on Russia and that they have not influenced in a pro-Western manner either public opinion or the national security decision making of the elite in that country. Notes 1. The close relationships between economic power and national security are recognised both in the academic literature (see below) and by contemporary European leaders. When introducing the Strategic Defence and Security Review in November 2015, UK Prime Minister David Cameron wrote: 'Economic security and national security go hand in hand. So at the heart of our strategy is our decision to see through our long-term economic plan and use our renewed economic strength to invest further in our security' <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Cameron, 2015)</ref>. in April 2015 German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble stated that 'in the long term, the conflict with Putin's Russia will be decided only on the basis of economic strength … European sanctions are definitely having an impact on Putin's Russia. But we can afford these sanctions only because -and as long as -we have a strong economy' (Brookings institution, 2015). 2. These hidden processes are described in more detail and evaluated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Davis (2014a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Davis ( , 2016</ref>.</p><p>The latter paper shows the structural similarities in the mathematical equations representing the processes of Negative Value Added, Rent Extraction and Implicit Subsidisation of East Europe. 3. <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Kennedy (1988)</ref> evaluates the general dynamics of the Russian Empire and the USSR, as well as specific issues related to Ukraine, such as Russia's annexation of Crimea in 1783 and its relations with Ukraine and Poland (see map on p. 109). 4. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Davis (1999)</ref> contains a comparative economic systems analysis of industrialisation and industrial policy in Russia/USSR, with sections on the Russian Empire, New Economic Policy, Stalin economy, Brezhnev period and the Russian Federation in the 1990s. 5. The low-key USA treatment of the annexation of the Baltic States by the USSR in 1940 contrasts with its more robust current policies toward Russia in connection with the annexation of Crimea in 2014. 6. The assessments of the ineffectiveness of arms transfers to weak governments by superpowers provides background evidence related to the debate over NATO arms supplies to Ukraine discussed on p.14. 7. Connolly (2015a) correctly points out that the Russian economy possessed not only the two sectors identified in the virtual economy model of negative value-added heavy industry (A) and the rent-generating energy sector (B), but also a growing competitive private sector (services and industries) (C) with hard budget constraints and profit orientation. 8. <ref type="bibr">Huntington (1996, p. 165)</ref> claimed that Ukraine is a 'cleft country' that contains a 'civilizational fault line' between areas with backgrounds in Western empires and those rooted in Russian Orthodoxy and suggested that this could lead to the fragmentation of the country. See related maps on pp. 159 and 166. 9. Russian energy-related subsidies of Armenia, Belarus and Ukraine were continuations into the transition period of the Soviet practice of implicitly subsidising East European countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Marrese &amp; vanous, 1983)</ref> discussed above. 10. Cumulative FDi inflows per capita over 1989-2008 were $4492 for Central Europe and the Baltic States, but only $899 for Ukraine and $304 for Russia <ref type="bibr">(EBRD, 2009, p. 27)</ref>, so foreign finance was of limited significance to Russia. 11. Although in the period before the Ukraine crisis NATO would not accept the argument that the actions of its European member countries in reducing defence expenditures and military capabilities were undermining conventional deterrence, it is noticeable that since 2014 NATO has justified its redeployments of troops and weapon systems to East Europe and the Baltic states and calls for increased defence spending by claiming that these measures will help to deter future aggressive military moves by Russia. 12. iMF (2014) announced a $17 billion support package in April 2014, and subsequently dispersed $4.5 billion of it. in February 2015 a new $17.5 billion conditional loan was approved to replace the initial one (iMF, 2015b). The EC provided Ukraine with Macro-Financial Assistance loans of (in millions) €100 (May 2014), €500 (June 2014), €260 (November 2014), €500 (December 2014) and €250 (April 2015). it has approved an additional €1.5 billion in assistance for Ukraine <ref type="bibr">(EC, 2015)</ref>. 13. President Putin has a historical perspective on economic sanctions that has similarities with the one presented in this paper. in his 2014 State of the Nation speech he stated: 'Speaking of the sanctions, they are not just a knee-jerk reaction on behalf of the United States or its allies to our position regarding the events and the coup in Ukraine, or even the so-called Crimean Spring. i'm sure that if these events had never happened … they would have come up with some other excuse to try to contain Russia's growing capabilities, affect our country in some way, or even take advantage of it. The policy of containment was not invented yesterday. it has been carried out against our country for many years, always, for decades, if not centuries. in short, whenever someone thinks that Russia has become too strong or independent, these tools are quickly put into use' <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Putin, 2014)</ref>. 14. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Davis (2005)</ref>  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="16.">Although the legal adjudication of the responsibility for the shooting down of Malaysian Airlines</head><p>Flight 17 has not been completed, the case of the more obvious shooting down of KAL 007 by a Soviet fighter jet in 1981 (see p. 16) suggests that any additional sanctions related to this action are likely to be diluted by Big Power compromises over foreign policy issues in the years ahead. 17. Economic relations between Russia and Turkey deteriorated in November 2015 due to the latter shooting down a Sukhoi 24 bomber belonging to the former in Syrian airspace in November 2015. in response to this incident Russia imposed wide-ranging economic sanctions on Turkey, which shifted the latter country into the anti-Russia sanctions category identified in <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">Table 9</ref>. 18. vernon and Kapstein (1991) edited a special issue of Daedalus that examined the break-down of the Cold War practice of maintaining national capabilities in defence industries as a result of the seemingly inexorable trend toward globalisation. Over the past 25 years no NATO defence sector has been able to sustain autonomous military R&amp;D and production capabilities. instead, many critical components of weapons/sensor production have been out-sourced to low-cost high-tech countries, such as the People's Republic of China. Russia and China have established close links in the technological espionage and weapons production spheres. 19. Gaddy and ickes (2014a) point out that Russia is the sole market for many Ukrainian industrial goods because of historically-determined technological compatibilities and their uncompetitive characteristics. So Ukraine's embargo on exports of industrial products to Russia is likely to mean that its firms will not find alternative customers. Some Russian industrial firms face similar difficulties due to Ukrainian restrictions on imports. 20. All statistics for Russia and Ukraine for 2015-2016 are the best estimates as of January 2016. 21. in World Bank (2015b) Part 3. The Economic Impact of Sanctions the authors mention several quantitative methodologies that could be applied to study Russia sanctions, but are not used in the actual analysis. They attempt to draw out lessons for the current situation in Russia from the history of economic sanctions against South Africa in the 1980s. No references are made to the history of Western sanctions directed against the USSR and Russia or counter-measures <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">(Tables 6, 7</ref> and 8 of this article). No Russian language secondary or archive sources are cited in this study, which is typical for a product of an international organisation. 22. in March 2015 former Russia Finance Minister Kudrin estimated the direct costs to Russia to that date of the support of Crimea to be about $7 billion and that the combination of direct and indirect costs (some generated by sanctions) over three years would amount to around $150 billion (TASS, 2015). 23. <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Reuters (2015)</ref> reported that Gazprom Neft expects to double the production of oil in the Arctic Prirazlomnoe field in 2015 to 600,000 tons using offshore drilling technology, which is supposed to be restricted by sanctions. The Human Intelligence-bereft CiA has negligible capabilities to monitor visits to restricted remote territories in Russia by well-paid and suitably cautious Western energy engineers and technicians. 24.
