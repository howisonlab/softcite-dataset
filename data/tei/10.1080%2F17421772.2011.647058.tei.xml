				<p>Spatial heterogeneity, spatial dependence and spatial scale constitute key features of spatial analysis of housing markets. However, the common practice of modelling spatial dependence as being generated by spatial interactions through a known spatial weights matrix is often not satisfactory. While existing estimators of spatial weights matrices are based on repeat sales or panel data, this paper takes the approach to a cross-section setting. Specifically, based on an a priori definition of housing submarkets and the assumption of a multifactor model, we develop maximum likelihood methodology to estimate hedonic models that facilitate understanding of both spatial heterogeneity and spatial interactions. The methodology, based on statistical orthogonal factor analysis, applied to the urban housing market of Aveiro (Portugal) at two different spatial scales, provides exciting inferences on the spatial structure of the housing market.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>This paper examines the role of space in housing markets within the context of a spatial hedonic pricing model applied to the city of Aveiro, Portugal. The above application is based on a methodological contribution, namely maximum likelihood inference for an unknown spatial weights matrix in a pure cross-section setting, for a given a priori characterization of housing submarkets. Specifically, the paper modifies the methodology developed in Bhattacharjee &amp; Jensen-Butler (2011) for estimation of a symmetric spatial weights matrix in a panel data setting, to the current context of cross-section data, admitting a factor structure and structural spatial dependence arising from a spatial error model. The estimated spatial weights matrix is not constrained by restrictive assumptions relating to drivers of spatial diffusion, and offers unique opportunities to understand the nature of interactions in urban space.</p><p>Our framework and applications pay special attention to three related but distinct aspects of spatial analyses relating to housing markets*spatial heterogeneity, spatial dependence and spatial scale. The former two spatial aspects have been extensively discussed in the spatial econometrics literature (see, for example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Anselin, 1988a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Anselin, , 1988b</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Anselin, , 1999</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Anselin, , 2002</ref>. To quote: 'Spatial dependence may be caused by different kinds of spatial spill-over effects, while heteroscedasticity could easily result from the heterogeneity inherent in the delineation of spatial units and from contextual variation over space' <ref type="bibr">(Anselin, 1988b, p. 1)</ref>. Spatial scale is not so much an econometric, but an important empirical issue, and has been discussed widely in the housing economics literature, for example in <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Malpezzi (2003)</ref>. Whether an urban scale is the most suitable, or whether the appropriate scale for analysis should be peri-urban (including an urban centre, adjoining suburbs and the countryside), regional or national, depends on both the spatial phenomenon under analysis and the specific spatial context.</p><p>In our framework, analysis proceeds as follows. First, a suitable spatial scale is fixed. Next, at the above chosen scale, we begin by segmenting the housing market into submarkets, based on a combination of several criteria: administrative boundaries, hedonic substitutability and socio-cultural segmentation. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> Given the above segmentation into submarkets, spatial dependence relates to inferences on spatial weights representing spillovers across different submarkets, and those between houses within the same submarket. For the former, the methodology in Bhattacharjee &amp; Jensen-Butler (2011) can be adapted, provided we can estimate the cross-submarket spatial autocovariance matrix of the errors; for this purpose, we use a methodology based on the cross-section factor model. For the second, we develop maximum likelihood methodology, where we assume for simplicity that the within-submarket spatial weights are the same across all submarkets.</p><p>Following the spatial econometrics literature (see, for example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Anselin, 1988b</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Anselin, , 1999</ref>, spatial heterogeneity is used to inform spatially varying coefficients, spatial structural change and heteroscedasticity. In our framework, this is achieved by allowing for heterogeneity across submarkets in intercepts and slopes of the factorbased hedonic housing price model, as well as the error variance. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> As mentioned above, the proposed methodology is based on statistical factor analysis on housing and location characteristics. Applied to the housing market of Aveiro segmented into submarkets at two different spatial scales, the method provides a description of urban spatial structure based on spatial heterogeneity, spatial interactions and spatial scale. The resulting spatial model is useful for understanding relative importance of various elements*housing characteristics and access to central and local amenities, as well as interactions within and between housing submarkets* and provides useful inferences on residential location, urban planning and policy. Substantial gains are also obtained with regard to house price prediction.</p><p>In several ways, the proposed framework offers improved understanding of space in housing markets. First, we represent spatial heterogeneity through a factorbased hedonic pricing model estimated at the submarket level. In the process, we follow the literature, beginning with <ref type="bibr">Archer &amp; Williamson (1973)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Davies (1974)</ref>, on the use of statistical factor analysis to aggregate hedonic characteristics into interpretable behavioural categories. These orthogonal factors are then used as explanatory variables in a hedonic pricing regression model in log-linear form. The model allows for spatial heterogeneity in the form of different preferences for housing and access characteristics in different submarkets and submarket-specific fixed effects. Substantial spatial heterogeneity is observed, providing useful interpretation for urban spatial structure.</p><p>Second, following the emerging econometric literature on unknown spatial weight matrices <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Bhattacharjee &amp; Holly, 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Bhattacharjee &amp; Jensen-Butler, 2011)</ref>, we develop methodology to estimate spatial interactions within and across housing submarkets under the structural assumption of symmetry. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">As Anselin &amp; Lozano-Gracia (2008)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Anselin et al. (2010)</ref> demonstrate, it is important in hedonic models to allow for interactions modelled by a spatial econometric model. At the same time, there is explicit acknowledgement in the literature of considerable uncertainty regarding real drivers of spatial diffusion, and that assuming spatial weights based on geographic distances or contiguity is far too simplistic <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Giacomini &amp; Granger, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Bhattacharjee &amp; Jensen-Butler, 2011)</ref>. Our work extends the literature on estimation of the spatial weights matrix to a pure cross-section setting under the structural assumption of symmetry; for a critical review of some recent methods in the panel data setting, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Bhattacharjee &amp; Holly (2011)</ref>.</p><p>Third, in conducting analyses and obtaining inferences on heterogeneity and interactions at two different spatial scales, our work emphasizes the importance of spatial scale. In our view, studying spatial structure of housing markets from all the above dimensions is important not only for understanding residential location but also for urban planning and housing policy; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Maclennan (2010)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Bhattacharjee et al. (2010)</ref> for further discussion.</p><p>Finally, our conceptual framework, combining unknown spatial interactions with unrestricted spatial heterogeneity, has important connections to philosophical views in geography and urban studies. Spatial heterogeneity relates to the idea of distinctive identity of spatial units or 'unique spaces' <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Hartshorne, 1939)</ref> and emphasizes neighbourhood effects. Further, our representation of spatial dependence in terms of an unknown spatial weights matrix is closely wed to the idea of abstract and endogenously produced space in <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Lefebvre (1974</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Lefebvre ( [1991</ref>). At the same time, our spatial weights matrices acknowledge the notion of distance decay inherent in logical positivism <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Schaefer, 1953)</ref>, while abstracting from the Cartesian characterization of space emphasized in exogenous and given spatial weights matrices based on distance or contiguity.</p><p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we discuss our methodology and place it within the context of the emerging literature on inferences relating to unknown spatial interactions. Following this, in Section 3, we apply our methods to a spatial hedonic price model for the city of Aveiro, using a small but very rich dataset on hedonic characteristics of properties sold through the leading real estate agency in 2007. Next, we extend the analysis to the peri-urban spatial scale including neighbouring parishes with potentially substantial spillovers with Aveiro, based on data for all properties put on the market between 2000 and 2010 (Section 4). With both datasets, we find important evidences on spatial heterogeneity and dependence that inform our understanding of the urban spatial structure of the housing markets in Aveiro, as well as the importance of spatial scale. Section 5 concludes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Methodology</head><p>Our proposed methodology combines spatial hedonic analysis based on orthogonal factors with a method for inferences on unknown spatial weights matrices under the structural constraint of symmetric spatial weights. Below, we discuss our methodology in further detail.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Hedonic Pricing Model</head><p>Building on the early work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Lancaster (1966)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Rosen (1974)</ref>, hedonic pricing models continue to be actively used in housing studies. In particular, valuation of access to central and local services and other housing attributes, and construction of price indices based on single sales data, have been addressed through hedonic specifications; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Maclennan (1977)</ref> for a classic and critical discussion, and Chattopadhya (1999), <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Malpezzi (2003)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Palmquist (2005)</ref> for recent reviews.</p><p>In hedonic pricing models, dwelling unit values (or proxies such as prices or rents) are regressed on a bundle of characteristics of the unit that determine the value:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">P ¼ f S; N ; L; C; T ð Þ</formula><p>where P denotes the value of the house (price, or price per unit area), and S, N, L, C and T denote, respectively, structural characteristics of the dwelling (living space, type of construction, tenure, etc.); neighbourhood characteristics (and local amenities); location within the market (or access to employment/business centre); other characteristics (access to utilities and public services, such as clean water supply, electricity, central heating, etc.); and the time (date, month) when the value is observed. Estimating the hedonic price function using a collection of observed housing values and dwelling unit characteristics yields a set of implicit prices for housing characteristics that are essentially willingness-to-pay estimates. This allows analysis of various upgrading scenarios, targeted to specific subgroups, defined either by socio-economic characteristics or by location. Thus, the model facilitates understanding of residential location, and therefore urban structure, and provides valuable input towards urban planning and housing policy.</p><p>Theory provides no guidance for the functional form appropriate for hedonic regression. However, a nonlinear hedonic function is useful for recovering the underlying structural demand curve from estimates of the hedonic relationship (the reduced form). This and several other important advantages motivated <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Follain &amp; Malpezzi (1980)</ref> to recommend the semi-log form; for further discussion, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Follain &amp; Malpezzi (1980)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Malpezzi (2003)</ref>.</p><p>In this paper, we estimate the hedonic model with a small modification to the semi-log form, where logarithm of price per square meter of living space is regressed on logarithm of house area, conditioning on several other hedonic housing characteristics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Factor Structure and Multivariate Dimension Reduction 3</head><p>There are literally hundreds of potential housing characteristics that could be included on the right hand side of a hedonic regression model. Unfortunately, coefficient estimates are not robust to the omitted variables problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Butler, 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Ozanne &amp; Malpezzi, 1985)</ref>. However, the same correlation between omitted and included variables that biases individual coefficient estimates often aids better prediction from a 'sparse' model <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Malpezzi, 2003)</ref>.</p><p>This feature of the hedonic pricing model enhances the possibility of exploiting the factor structure to obtain parsimonious estimates and improved predictions. Several studies, beginning with <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Kain &amp; Quigley (1970)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Archer &amp; Wilkinson (1973)</ref>, have taken this approach, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Davies (1974)</ref> combined factor analysis with the regression approach. In a critical review, <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Maclennan (1977)</ref> suggests that the researcher needs to make sure that the extracted factors do not reflect solely statistical properties but behavioural collections of housing characteristics.</p><p>In this paper, we employ a hybrid approach, combining factor analysis with regression. Initially, we identify a small collection of leading factors from a large number of potentially important hedonic characteristics, using factor analysis with varimax orthogonal rotations. For both the datasets used in this paper, these (orthogonal) factors are clearly identified with interpretable collections of housing characteristics, such as structural dimensions, access to utilities, centrality and access to local services. At the second stage, we predict factor values for all properties, including those for which some hedonic characteristics are missing, and use these predicted factors to estimate the hedonic regression model in semi-log form.</p><p>In this way, we address the <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Davies (1974)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Maclennan (1977)</ref> critiques. Further, the assumed factor model is absolutely crucial for our proposed inference methods for the spatial weights matrix; we will discuss this issue in Section 2.4. In addition, the factor-based hedonic housing price model offers three potential advantages.</p><p>First, in building a hedonic model based on a small number of factors, rather than a large collection of housing characteristics, we build a parsimonious model with more precise estimation that offers better interpretation of the regression coefficients (implicit prices). More importantly, in including all potential economic factors affecting prices, the factor-based regression model is less susceptible to the omitted variables problem. Second, hedonic regression based on factors allows a unique opportunity to reduce missing value problems, where factors can be predicted (imputed) using the information available on only a selection of included characteristics, under the assumption that the missing data are allocated randomly across the properties conditional on the values of observed features. This leads to considerably larger sample sizes for estimation of the hedonic model, with benefits of improved precision in the estimates. Third, the approach based on orthogonal factors is not subject to multicollinearity, and could therefore contribute to higher efficiency, which in turn can lead to better prediction of housing prices; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Malpezzi (2003)</ref> for further discussion. Besides, the orthogonality of factors is also important for estimating the spatial weights, which we discuss later in Section 2.4.</p><p>Finally, and most importantly, the factor-based approach is absolutely crucial for our methodology for estimating spatial weights. Thus, it is very useful for studying spatial dependence in urban housing markets driven by an unknown spatial weights matrix.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Spatial Issues in Hedonic Pricing Estimates</head><p>The recent literature has discussed the potential bias and loss of efficiency that can result when spatial effects are ignored in the estimation of hedonic models; see, for example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Pace &amp; LeSage (2004)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Anselin &amp; Lozano-Gracia (2008)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Anselin et al. (2010)</ref>. Spatial patterns in the housing markets arise from a combination of spatial heterogeneity and spatial dependence <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Anselin, 1988a)</ref>. Additionally, as discussed before, choice of an appropriate spatial scale is important <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Malpezzi, 2003)</ref>. We now turn to a discussion of spatial issues in the construction of our hedonic pricing models, including all of the three above aspects of space.</p><p>2.3.1. Spatial scale and housing submarkets. Definition of submarkets is important at both conceptual and empirical levels. Housing markets are local and diverse, and hedonic price estimation requires careful delineation of these markets <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Malpezzi, 2003)</ref>. The definition of submarkets in practice ranges from the national or regional scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Linneman, 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Mills &amp; Simenauer, 1996)</ref>, through metropolitan areas <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Follain &amp; Malpezzi, 1980)</ref>, to below the metropolitan level <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Straszheim, 1975;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Gabriel, 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Grigsby et al., 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Rothenberg et al., 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Maclennan &amp; Tu, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Bourassa et al., 1999)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Malpezzi (2003)</ref> argues that one reason why the metropolitan area is appealing as the unit of analysis is that these areas are usually thought of as labour markets, which may therefore be approximately coincident with housing markets. On the other hand, submarkets below the metropolitan level can be segmented by location (central city/suburb), or by housing quality, or even by race or income levels. Such segmentation facilitates both understanding of residential neighbourhood choice and devising appropriate urban housing policy. However, the empirical literature does not suggest an unambiguous definition of a unique spatial scale.</p><p>In this paper, we conduct our analysis at two different spatial scales, both disaggregated to a relatively fine spatial level. In the first, we consider administrative regions (parishes) within the city of Aveiro as submarkets, and pool the suburban area together into a single submarket. This definition aids understanding of spatial heterogeneity and interactions within the urban area, but does not provide satisfactory analysis in terms of spillovers between the city and the suburban area. Second, we extend our analysis to a finer spatial scale within the suburban area, constructing submarkets with careful consideration to the principles of segmentation discussed above. Our analysis reflects some advantages of using a flexible spatial scale, since processes of agglomeration and dispersion operate differently at different scales <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Arbia et al., 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Arbia et al., , 2012</ref>.</p><p>2.3.2. Spatial heterogeneity and neighbourhood effects. The conceptual notion behind spatial submarkets discussed above implies that the price determining (hedonic) mechanism can be heterogeneous over space. This spatial heterogeneity can originate from demand and supply factors, institutional barriers or discrimination, each of which can cause differentials across neighbourhoods in the way housing attributes are valued by consumers and house prices determined <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Anselin et al., 2010)</ref>. However, if spatial heterogeneity is present and ignored, an average price across all submarkets is estimated that ignores submarket heterogeneity. Worse still, the error term of the regression can then be correlated with the included regressors and ordinary least squares (OLS) will produce biased estimates. The standard urban model in the AlonsoÁMuthÁMills tradition predicts a generally declining pattern of prices with distance from the centre of the city, though there may be spatial variation in relative preference for centrality. Other models based on localized amenities or multiple centres imply a stronger impact of access to local amenities. Like distances, the implicit prices for dwelling characteristics and size may also vary spatially, reflecting either supply constraints or residential sorting. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Follain &amp; Malpezzi (1980)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Mozolin (1994)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Adair et al. (2000)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Soderberg &amp; Janssen (2001)</ref>, among others, have examined intra-urban variation in the price of housing using hedonic models. We follow the above line of literature in allowing coefficients in our hedonic pricing model to vary across submarkets, and use the estimated variation to infer on residential neighbourhood choice and urban spatial structure.</p><p>2.3.3. Spatial dependence and spatial weights matrix. In contrast to spatial heterogeneity, spatial dependence leads to spatial autocorrelation, implying that prices of nearby houses tend to be more similar than those of houses that are farther apart. Likewise, average price of houses in nearby or related submarkets may be correlated more strongly. A common explanation for spatial autocorrelation is spatial spillovers or other forms of contagion effects. However, incorrectly modelled spatial heterogeneity, measurement problems in explanatory variables, omitted variables, and unmodelled features having a spatial pattern can also lead to spatial autocorrelation <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Anselin &amp; Griffith, 1988)</ref>. Recent empirical literature has addressed issues of bias and loss of efficiency that can result when spatial effects are ignored in the estimation of hedonic models (see, for example <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Pace &amp; LeSage, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr">Anselin &amp; Lozano-Garcia, 2008)</ref> and the use of spatial econometric models to address spatial autocorrelation is becoming increasingly standard. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> The usual approach to the representation of spatial interactions is to define a spatial weights matrix, denoted W, which typically represents a theoretical and a priori characterization of the nature and strength of spatial interactions between different submarkets or dwellings. 5 These spatial weights represent patterns of diffusion of prices and unobservables over space, and thereby provide a meaningful and easily interpretable representation of spatial interaction (spatial autocorrelation). The spatial weights are typically modelled as functions of geographic or economic distance. The distance between two spatial units reflects their proximity with respect to prices or unobservables, so that the spatial interaction between a set of units (dwellings) can be represented as a function of the economic distances between them.</p><p>Given a particular choice of the spatial weights matrix, there are two important and distinct ways in which spatial dependence is modelled in spatial regression analysis*the spatial lag model and the spatial error model. In the former, the hedonic regression includes, as an additional regressor, the spatial lag of the dependent variable y (which in our case is price), represented by Wy, and the regression errors (o) are completely idiosyncratic. By contrast, in the spatial error model, the regression errors are spatially dependent on their spatial lag, Wo.</p><p>The implications of spatial interaction on estimation of these two models are different. In the spatial lag model, the endogenous spatial lag implies that OLS estimates not accounting for spatial interaction would be biased, while in the spatial error model, they will be unbiased but inefficient. However, though different in interpretation, the above two models are very difficult to distinguish empirically <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Anselin, 1999</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Anselin, , 2002</ref>. In line with current practice in the area of spatial econometrics, we first estimate the hedonic pricing model under the spatial error assumption. Next, to judge whether endogenous spatial lags are relevant, we perform a test for spatial lag dependence by nesting the spatial error model within a hybrid model incorporating both spatial lag and spatial error dependence; for more discussion on sequential model selection in the spatial context, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Born &amp; Breitung (2011)</ref>.</p><p>The choice of appropriate spatial weights is a central component of spatial models as it imposes a priori a structure of spatial dependence, which may or may not closely correspond to reality. Further, the accuracy of these measures affects severely the estimation of spatial dependence models <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Anselin, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Fingleton, 2003)</ref>. Spatial contiguity or suitable functions of geographic distances are frequent choices. However, spatial data may be anisotropic, where spatial autocorrelation is a function of both distance and the direction separating points in space <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Simon, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Gillen et al., 2001)</ref>. Further, spatial interactions may be driven by other factors, such as trade weights, transport cost, travel time and socio-cultural distances. The choice typically differs widely across applications, depending not only on the specific economic context but also on availability of data. The problem of choosing spatial weights is a key issue in many applications.</p><p>Given the above ambiguities regarding measurement of spatial weights, and in line with the notion that factors different from geographic distance or contiguity may potentially drive spatial interactions, we consider the spatial weights matrix (W) as an unknown symmetric matrix with zero diagonal elements. We allow spatial interactions to be potentially negative, often implying segmented housing markets or asynchronous housing cycles. 6 Based on a given definition of urban submarkets (or a fixed set of spatial locations) and panel data on these spatial units, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Bhattacharjee &amp; Holly (2009</ref> and Bhattacharjee &amp; Jensen-Butler <ref type="formula">2011</ref>developed several methods to estimate the spatial weights matrix between the submarkets. 7 Here, we extend the panel estimation methodology in Bhattacharjee &amp; Jensen-Butler (2011) under the structural assumption of symmetric spatial weights to a purely cross-section setting.</p><p>Specifically, we consider a cross-section Gaussian factor regression model <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Liu &amp; Rubin, 1998)</ref> where each housing property i (01, . . ., n) belongs to a single submarket M j , where M j is one of J mutually exclusive and exhaustive submarkets M 1 , M 2 , . . ., M J . The price of the dwelling y i depends on a (q )1) vector of unobserved orthonormal Gaussian factors F i of housing and locational hedonic characteristics (the (p )1) vector x i , q Bp), where the effects of the factors potentially vary across the submarkets. The corresponding regression error o i is uncorrelated with the factors, but may be spatially related to the errors for other houses through an unknown spatial weights matrix, W. In other words, we consider a spatial error model with a cross-section heterogeneous factor structure across the submarkets, where the effects of the factors are potentially different across submarkets and there may be submarket-specific fixed effects:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">X i F i ; c; W ð ÞÂ indep N P aþc 0 F i ; W À Á ; i ¼ 1; 2;:::; n; W ¼ diag w 2 1 ; :::; w 2 p ; F i Â iid N q 0; I ð Þ; y i ¼ b 0j þ b 0 j F i þ e i ; e ¼ kW e þ t; i 2 M j t i Â N 0; r 2 j independent; Cov t i ; F i ð Þ ¼ 0:<label>(1)</label></formula><p>Here e ¼ e i ; e 2 ; . . . ; e n ð Þ 0 , the vector of the random errors, has a spatial error structure with an unknown spatial weights matrix W (n)n) having zero diagonal elements, and the zero mean Gaussian idiosyncratic errors (y i s) are potentially heteroscedastic across submarkets but independent over the cross-section and uncorrelated with the random factors F i . Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">1</ref>describes a simplified version of the cross-section factor model with heterogeneous group effects discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Andrews (2005)</ref>, with additional Gaussian assumptions. These distributional assumptions are useful in our case for drawing inferences by maximum likelihood on the intra-submarket spatial weights.</p><p>The spatial weights matrix W is the row-standardized version of W 0 nÂn ð Þ , which is assumed to be symmetric and have a block-structure as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">W 0 ij ¼ 0 if i ¼ j x o if i; j 2 M k ; k ¼ 1; :::; J x kl if i 2 M k ; j 2 M l ; M k \ M l ¼ /: 8 &lt; :</formula><p>( <ref type="formula">2)</ref>The above weights matrix is unknown and quite general, allowing for unknown but fixed spatial weights between properties in the same submarket, and similarly unknown spatial weights between properties in any pair of submarkets. 8 For identification in the reduced form, it is required that (IÁlW) is nonsingular. Further structural assumptions are required for identification. Following Bhattacharjee &amp; Jensen-Butler <ref type="formula">2011</ref>, we assume symmetric spatial weights within and between submarkets 9 *a standard assumption in the spatial econometrics literature. However, spatial weights are allowed to be negative. In this paper, we assume a spatial error model. Because of endogeneity, estimating the spatial weights matrix under the spatial lag model is a more difficult problem. However, we can perform specification tests against the spatial lag model under the assumption that the same spatial weights matrix W describes both spatial lag dependence and error dependence. For this purpose, we nest the above spatial error model within the following model that includes both spatial lag and spatial error, with different autoregressive coefficients:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">y ¼ qW y þ b 0 j F i þ e i ; i ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; n; i 2 M j ; e ¼ kW e þ t; t i Â N 0; r 2 j independent; Cov t i ; F i ð Þ ¼ 0:<label>(3)</label></formula><p>Born &amp; Breitung (2011) propose a regression-based test, where at the first stage, the spatial error model (1) is estimated. At the second stage, the test evaluates whether there is any residual spatial dependence that can be explained by spatial lag effect. We use this test to verify whether the spatial error model is adequate for our empirical applications. The test is simple to apply and has several advantages over standard LM tests; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Born &amp; Breitung (2011)</ref> for further details.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Estimation of Symmetric Spatial Weights Matrix</head><p>As discussed before, our main methodological contribution is to estimate unknown spatial weights within a factor-based cross-section spatial error model. Next, we describe our estimation methodology in three steps: first, the cross-market spatial interaction matrix W + (defined in Equation (4) below); second, the crosssubmarket spatial autocovariance matrix G; and finally, the within-submarket spatial weight v 0 .</p><p>2.4.1. Estimation of cross-market spatial interaction matrix. In the panel data setting, the methodology in Bhattacharjee &amp; Jensen-Butler (2011) is based on a given consistent estimator for the underlying hedonic regression model with spatial errors as in Equation (1). Based on residuals from the above estimation, a consistent estimatorĈ (with asymptotically normally distributed elements) is first obtained for the J)J cross-submarket spatial autocovariance matrix</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">C ¼ I À W Ã ð Þ À1 R I À W Ã ð Þ; W Ã ¼ k 0 x 12 . . . x 1J x 12 0 . . . x 2J . . . . . . . . . . . .</formula><p>x 1J x 2J . . . 0 2 6 6 6 6 6 4 3 7 7 7 7 7 5</p><p>;</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">and R ¼ diag r 2 1 ; r 2 2 ; . . . ; r 2 J Â Ã :<label>(4)</label></formula><p>Let us assume that such an estimatorĈ has been obtained. Bhattacharjee &amp; Jensen-Butler <ref type="formula">2011</ref>show how this estimatorĈ can then be used to estimate the unknown cross-submarket spatial weights matrix W + . Without any structural constraints on the weights matrix, the estimation problem is only partially identified, up to an orthogonal transformation of interactions. Specifically, they show that the matrix</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">V ¼ I À W Ã ð Þ:diag 1 r 1 ; 1 r 2 ; . . . ; 1 r J h i</formula><p>is consistently estimated, up to an arbitrary orthogonal transformation, bŷ</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">C À1=2 ¼Ê:K À1=2 :Ê 0 ;</formula><p>whereÊ: andK contain the eigenvectors and eigenvalues, respectively, of the estimated spatial autocovariance matrixĈ. <ref type="bibr">10</ref> In other words,Ĉ (1/2 is a consistent estimator of VT for some unknown square orthogonal matrix T. Since T is an arbitrary orthogonal matrix, it has precisely J( JÁ1)/2 free elements. Hence, the spatial weights matrix W + can be precisely estimated only under additional structural constraints. Symmetry of the spatial weights matrix constitutes one set of valid identifying restrictions, 11 which is the structural assumption we make here. Under the symmetry assumption, Bhattacharjee &amp; Jensen-Butler (2011) describe inference methods and an algorithm for estimating the unknown spatial weights matrix. Estimation requires application of the 'gradient projection' algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Jennrich, 2001)</ref> which optimizes an objective function over the group of orthogonal transformations of a given matrix; standard errors are obtained using the bootstrap.</p><p>This method can be readily applied to our spatial hedonic pricing model provided an initial consistent estimator can be found for the cross-submarket spatial autocovariance matrix G. In this paper, we propose a maximum likelihood method to estimate this autocovariance matrix.</p><p>2.4.2. Estimation of cross-submarket spatial autocovariance matrix. In the panel data setting, Bhattacharjee &amp; Jensen-Butler (2011) estimated the underlying regression model and obtained residuals, and then estimatedĈ as the sample covariance matrix of the cross-market residuals. This step was relatively simple because, for each time period, there was a residual uniquely identified with each submarket.</p><p>In the current pure cross-section setting, the situation is more complex because a priori there is no natural way to associate a house in any one submarket with a corresponding house in any other submarket. For this matching problem, we use an analogy of the current cross-section factor model <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Andrews, 2005)</ref> with the multifactor error structure of cross-sectionally dependent panel data inherent in the common correlated effects methodology of <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Pesaran (2006)</ref>.</p><p>In the common correlated effects approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Pesaran, 2006)</ref>, linear combinations of unobserved common factors are approximated by cross-section averages of the dependent and explanatory variables, which are then included in the panel regression model in addition to the other regressors. The cross-section averages vary over time and not over the cross-section, and represent omitted time-specific common factors. Clearly, an alternative to these cross-section averages would be including a full set of time fixed effects. Bhattacharjee &amp; Jensen-Butler (2011) use residuals across spatial units for the same time period to estimate the spatial error autocovariance matrix. The multifactor spatial error model provides a clear justification for this approach. Residuals for the same period are matched because the corresponding observations on different spatial units align perfectly along the dimension of the unobserved latent factors*in the panel data setting, the time-specific common shocks. Taking this intuition to the pure cross-section setting, it is therefore natural to match housing property i in submarket M j with the dwelling j in another submarket M j that bears the closest correspondence in the vector of latent factors; in our case F i and F j . Thus, the proposed methodology proceeds as follows.</p><p>In the first stage, we estimate a suitable set of orthogonal factors based on hedonic characteristics. Using these estimated factors, we consistently estimate the hedonic regression model in Equation (1) separately for each submarket. This estimation allows for full spatial heterogeneity, but ignores the spatial error structure. Based on these submarket-specific regression estimates, we obtain residuals for each property.</p><p>We match properties across submarkets in the second stage. Specifically, to the residual for an index dwelling i in submarket M i , we match the residual for that house j in submarket M j that has the closest match in the vector of estimated factors; in other words,</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">j ¼ arg min j Ã 2M j F i À F j Ã 0 F i À F j Ã</formula><p>In the third stage, based on matched residuals across the different submarkets, the cross-submarket spatial autovariance matrix is estimated simply by the sample covariance matrixĈ. Finally, estimation of W + follows using the Bhattacharjee &amp; Jensen-Butler (2011) methodology outlined in the previous subsection.</p><p>The assumption of the multifactor model is crucial for this estimation procedure. 12 First, residuals from an estimated hedonic pricing model would be extremely susceptible to the potential omitted variables problem. In practical terms, it is very difficult to avoid this problem, even if a large number of hedonic characteristics are included in the estimation. By contrast, in estimating the factor model, it is simpler to minimize this problem by including factors corresponding to all notional features that theory and past studies have identified as determinants of house prices. One can then make the reasonable assumption that what remains in the error is uncorrelated with the included factors.</p><p>Second, and as discussed above, the factor model is conceptually very closely related to the critical distinction between spatial strong and weak dependence <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Pesaran &amp; Tosetti, 2011)</ref>, and therefore to the common correlated effects approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Pesaran, 2006)</ref>. Specifically, in the panel data setting, the theoretical justification for matching residuals corresponding to different spatial units for the same time period is that they match on the strong spatial dependence (or, unobserved factor) dimension. Matching against estimated factors provides an exact conceptual counterpart to this argument in our cross-section factor model setting. <ref type="bibr">13</ref> Third, since our estimated factors are orthogonal by construction, it is straightforward to match two properties in different submarkets by the inner product (sum of squares) of the vector of difference of their corresponding estimated factors.</p><p>Finally, under the assumptions of the factor model (1),Ĉ estimated as above is the maximum likelihood estimator of the spatial autocovariance matrix (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Andrews, 2005)</ref> under the maintained factor model and Gaussian error assumption. Since there is a unique relation between G and the corresponding W + , the corresponding cross-submarket symmetric spatial weights matrix is a maximum likelihood estimate as well.</p><p>2.4.3. Estimation of within-submarket spatial weight. What remains now is to estimate the within-submarket spatial weight v 0 . Since dwellings within a submarket are in general located closer to each other than those across different submarkets, it is expected that v 0 will be large compared to the cross-submarket spatial weights. We propose maximum likelihood to conduct this estimation. Specifically, for any candidate value of v 0 , we construct the corresponding row-standardized spatial weights matrix W, estimate the spatial error model using maximum likelihood, and evaluate the value of the maximized likelihood. In this way, we construct spatial weights matrices using various candidate values for v 0 , estimate the corresponding spatial error models by maximum likelihood using Geoda <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Anselin, 2005)</ref>, and maximize the likelihood over all such candidate values. Standard errors are estimated by numerical approximation to compute the Fisher information at this maximized value for v 0 . 14 Finally, as discussed earlier, we use the Born &amp; Breitung (2011) regression test to examine the validity of spatial error dependence against a hybrid model including a spatial lag.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Data</head><p>The proposed methodology is applied to the housing market of Aveiro, a city located in the Centro Region of Portugal. The urban agglomeration of Aveiro includes the municipality with the same name and the neighbouring municipality of Ílhavo and it had a population of 114,000 inhabitants in 2006. Our first empirical analysis refers only to the city, which corresponds to six of the 14 parishes of the municipality of Aveiro <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">(Table 1)</ref>. The dataset includes 166 properties sold through one of the leading real estate agencies in Aveiro in 2007. <ref type="bibr">15</ref> The spatial distribution of the properties is presented in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, where each house is indicated by a dot.</p><p>This dataset is quite different from the one analysed in the following section. One potential limitation is the reduced number of available observations, covering only the urban and suburban areas of Aveiro municipality. However, this is compensated by availability of data at a finer detail, including specific location of each house (so that exact distances can be computed) and greater detail of hedonic characteristics recorded for each house, but especially the availability of true transaction prices (rather than listing prices as in the second dataset). Most importantly, the small sample size enables us to obtain ML estimates of spatial econometric models using alternate definitions of spatial weights and thereby compare the adequacy of different specifications.</p><p>The data cover single unit housing (12.3%) and flats (87.7%), both newly built (11.8%) and used (88.2%), located in different urban and suburban areas. Data on several physical and location attributes of each house were collected, as well as exact location of each house. Location attributes were defined by geographic distances from each property to several amenities and services available within the city, constructed using Geographic Information System (GIS). These represent the desirability of each neighbourhood.  <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. Location of housing sample.</p><p>The dependent variable used in hedonic price models is usually the transaction price. We use a more scale neutral normalized measure*logarithm of price per square meter (p/m 2 ). Housing prices are explained by a wide set of variables (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>). Some location attributes are defined as minimum distances to services such as high schools or pharmacies; the others are defined as gravity type measures of potential, generated by distances to services like restaurants, sport centres or public administration offices. For this purpose, we define the potential (P i ) generated by a given set of services of type S (S 1 ,S 2 ,. . .,S n ) at a given location (i) by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">P i S ð Þ ¼ X n j¼1 S j d ij ;</formula><p>where S j denotes the service located at the point j and d ij the distance between locations i and j (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Stewart, 1947)</ref>. Descriptive statistics presented in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> reflect large variation in the physical and location attributes across the sample as well as missing value problems. Missing values for total area were imputed, under the standard assumption of conditionally missing at random, using the method of conditional mean imputation based on values of x and y; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Little (1992)</ref> for further discussion.</p><p>The dependent variable in our hedonic regression is price per square meter. All other physical and location attributes (including total area) are treated as explanatory variables. Observations with missing values in the other physical characteristics were omitted from the factor analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Factor Analysis</head><p>The explanatory variables were subjected to factor analysis followed by varimax rotations to extract orthogonal factors with maximum explanatory power. The leading factors were identified by maximum likelihood factor analysis on the original housing attributes. The scree plot suggested five leading factors, which were then optimally rotated by a orthogonal varimax procedure. Taken together, the five factors explain 63.4% of the variance of all the data. The extracted orthogonal factor loadings are reported in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref>; for visual clarity, we exclude from the table estimated loadings below the cut-off of 0.35. Based on these loadings, predicted factor scores were computed for use in subsequent analysis.</p><p>The five factors provide a clear interpretation in terms of behavioural collections of housing characteristics. Factor 1 corresponds to several indicators of centrality related to the city centre*the loadings being higher for amenities that are closer to the CBD. The loadings are positive on characteristics measured in minimum distances, and negative on those measured in gravitational potential. Factor 2 also describes centrality, in this case negatively related to access to local amenities such as shopping malls, railway stations, supermarkets or motorway connections.</p><p>By contrast, factors 3, 4 and 5 represent the internal characteristics of dwellings. Factor 3 is related to a combination of attributes which, in the case of Aveiro, are strongly correlated: being a flat or a single unit housing, having a gas connection and cable TV infrastructure <ref type="bibr">16</ref> (high values of the factor correspond to flats with gas and cable TV). Factor 4 represents housing space, combining house size with the number of rooms, while factor 5 refers to additional desirable characteristics such as living room and kitchen area and the provision for a garage.</p><p>Thus, the extracted factors represent behavioural collections of housing characteristics rather than statistical quantities with ambiguous interpretations <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Maclennan, 1977)</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Spatial Heterogeneity</head><p>Next, ordinary least squares (OLS) regression was used to estimate hedonic pricing models allowing for spatial heterogeneity across the urban submarkets of Aveiro. Predicted orthogonal factors obtained above, including imputations for missing values, were used as explanatory variables. Of the 166 housing properties in the dataset, there were complete data for only 118 houses. The possibility of imputation for missing values in the factors marks one of the advantages of the factor-based approach taken in this paper. The total area of the house was also included as a regressor. Since the dependent variable is logarithm of price per unit area, the coefficient on this regressor (b s ) is expected to lie between zero and negative unity (0 and (1), with the interpretation that 1'b s is the price elasticity of house area.</p><p>These regression models were estimated for the full sample as well as for each of the four submarkets defined by boundaries of administrative areas (parishes): Submarket 1 (Suburban: São Bernardo, Aradas and Santa Joana); Submarket 2 (Esgueira); Submarket 3 (Glória); and Submarket 4 (Vera Cruz). The final two are the most central areas encompassing the CBD of Aveiro, Glória being mostly residential while Vera Cruz caters to both the residential and service sector. Esgueira is partly urban and partly suburban. The estimated hedonic models reported in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 4</ref> are parsimonious and offer good scope for interpretation, both in terms of individual coefficients and their variation across the submarkets. The variation in price elasticity of housing space and shadow prices of the factors capture our notion of spatial heterogeneity.</p><p>In the aggregate model, the explained variation (in terms of adjusted R 2 ) is quite high and all the regressors are highly significant, with the exception of factor 2. The signs of the coefficients agree with a priori expectations. The price per square meter decreases with distance to CBD (factor 1) and increases with factor 4 (housing space) and factor 5 (size of living room and kitchen and provision for garage). The negative coefficient on factor 3 implies a single unit housing is preferable even if it implies absence of cable TV or gas infrastructure; the relatively low shadow price of this factor conceals heterogeneity across submarkets.</p><p>Substantial spatial heterogeneity is observed across the four submarkets in terms of shadow prices for different factors related to physical and location characteristics, as well as the price elasticity of total area. Analysis by submarkets shows important differences in the explanatory factors across the different parts of the city. Importantly, there is a substantial contrast between Vera Cruz and the other areas, showing that the traditional core of the city has a distinctive housing market. The estimates indicate that the elasticity of housing space is strongest in Glória and Esgueira, and weaker in Vera Cruz and the suburban area. While they are not statistically significant in any submarket, 17 access to both the centre and to local amenities is valued relatively highly in Vera Cruz. The significant negative coefficient for factor 3 for the suburban area and Esgueira implies that detached houses are more valued even if they lack infrastructures facilities (like cable TV or gas); for the more central Vera Cruz and Glória such an effect is not observed. The effect of factor 4 is the most heterogeneous across the submarkets, indicating that the importance ascribed to the number of rooms differs from area to area. The additional desirable features (factor 5, representing living room and kitchen area and the provision for a garage) attracts similar premium in all four submarkets.</p><p>We evaluated forecast performance of the various models by cross-validation analysis, that is, by comparing each observation against the predicted value based on leave-one-out sample estimates omitting the index dwelling. In line with arguments in <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Malpezzi (2003)</ref>, our factor-based model generated better predictions compared to a model with a full set of hedonic characteristics. Based on the 118 houses with full data, the estimated factor hedonic model without imputed factors has a cross-validation mean squared error (MSE) that is 16% lower than that of a model with full hedonics included. The cross-validation MSE using predicted factors is 30% higher, but based on a substantially larger sample of 166 observations. On the whole, the factor-based hedonic model has good predictive performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Spatial Interaction * Distance and Contiguity Based Spatial Weights</head><p>We now turn to an examination of spatial interaction between submarkets. First, we take the standard approach in spatial econometrics by constructing spatial weights based on distances and contiguity. Before estimating the hedonic price models with spatial effects, we explore whether properties with similar square meter prices were more spatially clustered than normally expected, using Moran's I test. This test statistic for the presence of spatial dependence is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">I ¼ n S P i P j w ij ðx i À lÞðx j À lÞ P i ðx i À lÞ 2 ;<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where n is the number of observations; x i and x j denote the observed prices (t/m 2 ) at locations i and j, respectively; m denotes the mean price; w ij the (i, j)-th element of the spatial weights matrix W, and S denotes the sum of all spatial weights:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">S ¼ P i P j w ij :</formula><p>The above statistic is often used to analyse global spatial autocorrelation and is known to depend strongly on the assumed specification of the spatial weights matrix <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Anselin, 1995)</ref>. However, as discussed above, the choice of spatial weights in applications is often arbitrary and determined subjectively by the researcher, and there is usually very little formal evidence supporting such choice <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Anselin, 2002)</ref>.</p><p>To ensure robustness with regard to choice of the spatial weights matrix, we explored several specifications: binary weights based on distances between houses ranging from within 100, 500, 1,000, 1,500, 3,000 and 5,000 meters, as well as rook and queen contiguity. <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 5</ref> reports the estimated Moran's I statistic 18 for these seven different specifications. Results for contiguity are visually illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. The four quadrants in the figure provide a classification of different types of spatial autocorrelation: highÁhigh (upper right) or lowÁlow (lower left) for positive spatial autocorrelation; and highÁlow (lower right) or lowÁhigh (upper left), for negative spatial autocorrelation. Positive spatial autocorrelation implies that a high (low) value in the current location is surrounded by high (low) values in neighbouring observations. The slope of the best-fitting regression line is Moran's I statistic <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Anselin, 2005)</ref>. While Moran's I index is useful for detecting the presence of spatial autocorrelation, it does not indicate the precise structure of spatial interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Anselin, 2005)</ref>.</p><p>Based on the above measures of contiguity or distance, Moran's statistics tend to be positive but are not significant, showing little evidence of spatial autocorrelation in housing prices. Taking this evidence on face value, we would be tempted to conclude that geographically adjacent observations have little or no influence on house prices*a rather unsatisfactory observation.</p><p>Next, we used the GEODA software <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Anselin, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Anselin et al., 2006)</ref> to perform a series of Lagrange Multipliers (LM) tests <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Anselin, 2005)</ref> for both spatial lag dependence and spatial error dependence. Specifically, in addition to OLS, we estimated by maximum likelihood (ML) alternative spatial regression models and investigated whether a spatial error or a spatial lag model, or indeed a model  <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. Moran scatter plot for residuals (contiguity weight matrix). Source: Results were produced using GEODA software <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Anselin, 2005)</ref>.</p><p>without spatial effects, best fit the data. We report the results for a spatial weights matrix based on rook and queen contiguity in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 6</ref>; results for other specifications of spatial weights are similar. Like Moran's I statistics, we find no evidence of spatial dependence. This is despite the fact that we have not accounted for spatial heterogeneity in these estimates*a feature that can contribute to spatial dependence. The Lagrange Multiplier (LM) test statistics are significant neither for the spatial error (p-value 0.41) nor the spatial lag (p-value 0.77) models. The null hypothesis of both tests, which is the lack of spatial dependence, cannot be rejected at the 5% significance level.</p><p>Therefore, spatial dependence is either absent or not related to the geographical notions of distances and contiguity considered in the above seven specifications. This highlights an important limitation of spatial econometric methods for studying hedonic pricing models, arising from the treatment of spatial dependence as the outcome of spillover processes which are dependent on previously fixed and arbitrary spatial weights matrices (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Giacomini &amp; Granger, 2004)</ref>. In other words, such evidence may have generated from ill-specified definitions of spatial weights, which is an issue we will investigate further in this paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.">Estimated Spatial Weights Matrix</head><p>As discussed before, this paper extends an emerging area of research that takes a more general view of the nature and strength of spatial diffusion and cross-section interaction. Moving away from the usual practice of ex ante definition of spatial interactions, we estimate the unknown spatial weights matrix that is consistent with an observed pattern of spatial dependence and is therefore suitable for interpretation. Specifically, as proposed in Section 2, we use an extension of the Bhattacharjee &amp; Jensen-Butler (2011) estimator to the pure cross-section setting Notes: t-/z-statistics in parentheses; +++ significant at the 1% level, ++ significant at the 5% level, + significant at the 10% level.</p><p>and obtain estimates of a symmetric spatial weights matrix under a spatial error model. The symmetry assumption adopted in this work is in line with the traditional practice in housing studies, and is a natural consequence of defining spatial weights based on distances. The first step is to estimate the spatial autocovariance matrix of residuals across the four submarkets. As discussed in Section 2, we use residuals across the four submarkets, matched by factors, to construct the cross-submarket error spatial autocovariance and autocorrelation matrix <ref type="table">(Table 7)</ref>. In contrast to the results above based on a priori fixed spatial weights, significant spatial autocorrelation can be observed between some submarkets. <ref type="table">Table 8</ref> reports the corresponding estimated symmetric spatial weights matrix for cross-submarket interactions. Results are consistent with the spatial structure of Aveiro, showing that Vera Cruz has a highly significant negative interaction with the suburban area, while Glória has a highly significant positive interaction with both the suburban area and Esgueira.</p><p>These observations can be explained by the urban geography of Aveiro. Vera Cruz represents a distinct housing market in the CBD of Aveiro and draws its housing demand from a population quite different from the inhabitants in large detached houses in the suburban area. Such segmented markets imply that negative spatial interactions are likely between these two submarkets. On the other hand, Glória and Esgueira are largely residential submarkets close to the centre and are likely to offer positive spillovers; the same is true for Glória and the suburban area which are contiguous submarkets.</p><p>However, the best test for how these spatial weights relate to the urban housing market in Aveiro would come from spatial econometric models based on these, to which we turn next.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6.">Spatial Models with Estimated Spatial Weights Matrix</head><p>Finally, we estimate the within-submarket spatial weight v 0 and test the validity of the spatial error model with the spatial weights matrix estimated as above. The <ref type="table">Table 7</ref>. Cross-submarket spatial error autocovariance and autocorrelation matrix (variances reported on the diagonal, autocorrelations below diagonal) Notes: +++ Significant at the 1% level, ++ significant at the 5% level, + significant at the 10% level.</p><p>estimates for the factor-based hedonic model <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">(Table 9)</ref> and for a corresponding model based on selected hedonic characteristics <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">(Table 10)</ref> are reported below.</p><p>The factor-based model provides inferences on spatial heterogeneity that fall along the lines of the results discussed above. As expected, the estimated withinsubmarket spatial weight,x 0 00.345, is much larger than any of the estimated cross-submarket spatial weights. With the corresponding estimated spatial weights matrixŴ , the data support spatial dependence through the spatial error model, but evidence in favour of the spatial lag model is not statistically significant. This inference is markedly different from the previous case where contiguity and distance based spatial weights were used. Notes: z-statistics in parentheses; +++ significant at the 1% level, ++ significant at the 5% level, + significant at the 10% level.</p><p>Furthermore, once spatial interaction through the spatial error model is accounted for, the <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Born &amp; Breitung (2011)</ref> regression test fails to reject the null hypothesis of no spatial lag. Thus, the spatial error model is appropriate for this application. This observation has important implications for inference and interpretation of spatial dependence in this application.</p><p>In particular, it would appear that the cost of not accounting for spatial dependence lies mainly in efficiency. Predictions using the spatial model provide a cross-validation MSE that is 11% lower than the OLS hedonic factor-based model with full spatial heterogeneity. This suggests substantial efficiency gains in terms of prediction. Notes: z-statistics in parentheses; +++ significant at the 1% level, ++ significant at the 5% level, + significant at the 10% level.</p><p>Inferences were largely similar when selected hedonic characteristics were used. In this case, both the spatial error model and the spatial lag model were individually supported by the data. However, the <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Born &amp; Breitung (2011)</ref> regression test fails to reject the null hypothesis that there is no spatial lag evidence after spatial error dependence is accounted for.</p><p>Overall, our analysis points to important benefits in terms of understanding the spatial structure of the housing market in Aveiro at a finer urban scale. Both issues relating to spatial heterogeneity and spatial interactions are prominent in the urban submarkets defined by administrative boundaries. The empirical analysis provides an illustration of the proposed framework and methods for understanding spatial heterogeneity and dependence. In particular, whereas traditional measures of spatial weights based on distance or contiguity support the counterintuitive impression of insignificant spatial dependence, the estimated spatial weights matrix is useful for modelling interactions and spillovers more appropriately. The sample size was somewhat limited, but provided the opportunity for ML estimation of spatial econometric models.</p><p>However, some inferences from our analysis are weak, particularly those related to factors representing access and centrality. On the one hand, coefficients are not significant in most cases (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Tables 4 and 9)</ref>; on the other hand, the restriction of the analysis to a limited number of parishes does not provide a general understanding of the housing market of Aveiro and its connection with the spatially heterogeneous social and economic conditions.</p><p>The consideration of the urban agglomeration corresponding to the municipalities of Aveiro and Ílhavo is more in line with the concept of metropolitan area discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Malpezzi (2003)</ref>. Hence, following arguments in <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Maclennan &amp; Tu (1996)</ref>, we extend our analysis to a broader spatial scale, using submarkets segregated by location, housing quality and income levels.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Analysis at the Peri-urban Scale</head><p>Now, we extend our analysis to the housing market of the peri-urban area combining the municipalities of Aveiro and Ílhavo and the surrounding areas, using data for several years. This dataset covers a more heterogeneous area with more submarkets which, in addition to providing inferences on spatial dependence, enables a richer interpretation of the interaction pattern and of its underlying drivers.</p><p>Seven submarkets were selected, using a combination of criteria in line with <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Maclennan &amp; Tu (1996)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Malpezzi (2003)</ref>: administrative boundaries, urban structure, demographic features and history of urban development. Spatial contiguity of submarkets was generally preserved, but not always. <ref type="bibr">19</ref> A short description of the selected submarkets is as follows (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3)</ref>.</p><p>. Aveiro inner city: the core of Aveiro city, including the administrative and service centre, as well as high density housing. This area has a higher concentration of more affluent residents. . City of I´lhavo: the administrative centre of a separate municipality, corresponding to the second centre of the urban agglomeration of Aveiro. . Gafanhas: a mixture of residential and industrial areas, including the most important port of Centro Region; the residential market combines older and consolidated settlements with detached houses spread in semi-urban areas,</p><p>with a marked predominance of working class and lower middle class residents. . Beaches: an area with a high population density, corresponding to a strip of land stretching between the sea and the lagoon; most houses are either second residences or used for rent in the high season. . Suburban Type A: a group of small areas not very far away from Aveiro inner city. New planned residential areas dominate, being either blocks of flats or clusters of detached houses; these areas attract people from the Aveiro inner city looking for more affordable housing. Traditional social groups of people owning a small agricultural property and working either in manufacturing or in low skill service jobs have been gradually substituted by the above urban inhabitants. . Suburban Type B: a combination of isolated new houses or blocks, typical of Suburban Type A, with old rural settlements; the proportion of urban incomers, relative to traditional social groups, is lower than in Suburban Type A. . Suburban Type C: similar to Suburban Type B but with a higher proportion of old rural settlements and traditional social groups.</p><p>The database used was provided by the biggest real estate agency of Portugal (Casa Sapo/Janela Digital) and includes a set of hedonic and location characteristics similar to, but less detailed than, those presented in Section 3. However it covers all the municipalities of Aveiro and Ílhavo and includes a much larger number of cases (12,467 dwellings) sold over a time span of about 10 years <ref type="bibr">(October 2000ÁMarch 2010</ref>.  An important difference relative to Section 3 is that the price data here refer to listing prices, rather than selling prices. We compensate for the wedge between listing and selling prices by including in our regressions the logarithm of time on the market (in days). In addition, we include time (yearly) fixed effects to control for aggregate cyclical and political factors.</p><p>Similar to the analysis presented in Section 3, GIS tools were used to compute the proximity of each house to a number of central and local amenities. The variables and descriptive statistics are reported in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 11</ref>.</p><p>Following an identical methodology, we use maximum likelihood factor analysis with orthogonal varimax rotation. Following the arguments in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Davies (1974)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Maclennan (1977)</ref>, we verify that the resulting five leading factors align well with housing characteristics related to behavioural patterns <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">(Table 12</ref>). The factors are as follows:</p><p>. Factor 1: access to the centre or to central amenities. . Factor 2: access to local services and amenities (health centres, parks/gardens, etc.), also implying proximity to the traditional local centres within the area under study. 20 . Factor 3: access to beaches, schools and local commerce. . Factor 4: housing space. . Factor 5: additional facilities <ref type="bibr">(garage, balcony, central heating, etc.)</ref>. The estimated hedonic model with spatial heterogeneity based on factors is reported in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 13</ref>. The results show substantial heterogeneity across the submarkets. Several important observations follow.</p><p>First, Beaches is quite a distinct housing market from the others, in terms of estimated factor prices that are very different from the rest of the submarkets. Second, and in particular, the price elasticity of house area is the least for Beaches (0.129) and highest for the inner city of Aveiro (0.429). This implies that the size of houses designed for holidays and weekend purposes is not particularly valued, while the demand in the most affluent area (CBD of Aveiro) is considerably more sensitive to size.</p><p>Third, while the general model shows that prices increase with access to the city centre, there is large variation across the different submarkets. In the CBD of Aveiro or suburban areas close to the city, the negative value attached to poor access to the city centre is highly significant, while access is most valuable in Beaches, which is the submarket located farthest from the centre. The same does not apply for the more remote Suburban Type C or submarkets such as Ílhavo or Gafanhas. This is explained by the different social profiles of inhabitants in these areas.</p><p>Fourth, access to local facilities has a heterogeneous effect on prices. However, by contrast to access to the centre, it is valued significantly, with the expected signs, only in Suburban Type A, B and C submarkets. This means that proximity to local centres is valued in the suburban areas, but not in CBD Aveiro, and even negatively valued in Ílhavo and Gafanhas. This is because local centres in the more urbanized locations tend to produce negative externalities such as noise or lack of parking space, while in the suburban areas they tend to be associated with better urban layouts and access to local amenities, different from that of unqualified suburban sprawl.</p><p>Fifth, additional facilities such as garage, balcony and central heating are positively valued with high significance everywhere, except in Beaches, where such attributes do not matter. Finally, living space is positively valued, and in largely equal measure, across all seven submarkets.</p><p>In general, spatial heterogeneity is in line with the urban geography of Aveiro and reflects the dynamics of urban development, and its analysis is important for understanding the spatial nature of the urban housing market and to provide guidelines for urban planning and housing policy. The unique character of the housing submarket in Beaches is related to its evolution as the destination for second homes and rental properties for holiday makers. Likewise, the high price elasticity for house area in the centre of Aveiro reflects scarcity rents. In turn, this shortage of housing space in the centre has led to migration from the city to the suburban areas, which have a larger price sensitivity to access. It would thus appear Notes: t-statistics in parentheses; +++ significant at the 1% level, ++ significant at the 5% level, + significant at the 10% level.</p><p>that further development of quality housing and good local amenities and access to the centre would make the suburban areas both affordable and desirable for the urban population. The spatial structure of the urban agglomeration of Aveiro is also prominent in the analysis of spatial interaction based on the estimated cross-submarket symmetric spatial weights matrix <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">(Table 14)</ref>. The first striking conclusion is that spatial interaction is significant for 17 out of 21 cells of the matrix. The main drivers of spatial interactions are common patterns of response to stochastic shocks; if for example, houses with particular characteristics become preferable for given social groups, we expect to obtain positive interactions between places with similar social structures and negative interactions for places where contrasted social groups dominate. Positive interactions between submarkets are also related to spillovers between these areas in unobservable housing characteristics, which in turn are prominent for areas contiguous in geographical location. Further, housing preferences similar across all submarkets are expected to generate an overall pattern of positive interaction.</p><p>As expected, contiguity or distance explains a number of the significant positive spatial weights across submarkets in Aveiro. These include: spatial weights between Beaches, Gafanhas and Suburban Type C; and between Suburban Type A and Suburban Type C on the one hand and CBD Aveiro, CBD Ílhavo and Suburban Type B on the other.</p><p>However, the spatial weights between some pairs of contiguous regions are not statistically significant or even negative (for example, between CBD Aveiro and Suburban Type B), and some other significant weights relate to non-contiguous regions. In other words, many significant spatial weights appear to be driven by reasons other than geographic distance or contiguity. Specifically, for some of these submarkets positive spillovers appear to be related to a combination of the coreÁ periphery relationship and socio-cultural factors. Examples include: CBD Aveiro and CBD Ílhavo; Beaches and CBD Aveiro; and CBD Ílhavo and Gafanhas.</p><p>Finally, <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 14</ref> indicates significant negative spatial interactions between CBD Aveiro and Suburban Type B, and between Suburban Type A and Suburban Type C. Apparently, both of these are related to market segmentation, where each submarket is attractive to different population groups. Admittedly, some of the above explanations are tentative, and would require further research to confirm and interpret. These developments are beyond the scope of the paper. However, what we clearly show is that the spatial weights matrix, estimated using our methodology, combined with the analysis of spatial heterogeneity, provides a very rich set of information which can be the basis for detailed analysis and for the disclosing of the causes underlying the observed spatial patterns. <ref type="bibr">21</ref> Finally, the above analysis at a larger spatial scale, in combination with previous analysis (based on central parishes), provides some insights about the importance of spatial scale. Largely focusing at the urban scale, our previous analyses provided useful inferences with regard to spatial heterogeneity and interactions across parishes. However, understanding of spillovers between the urban and suburban parishes was somewhat limited by the fact that the suburban area contained a heterogeneous mix of neighbourhoods. This issue was addressed in the current analysis by dividing the suburban area into various notional submarkets that segregate the varieties of living space <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Lefebvre, 1974</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Lefebvre, [1991</ref>) in a more useful way. In this larger spatial scale too, very interesting inferences are drawn relating to spatial heterogeneity and interactions. This highlights the fact that, with regard to study housing submarkets, a single scale may not always be adequate <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Whitehead, 2003)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusion</head><p>In summary, our work here puts the connection between urban spaces and housing markets in a new framework and develops methodology for understanding urban housing markets in terms of three distinct but interconnected features of space* spatial heterogeneity, spatial dependence and spatial scale. Our methodology relies on factor-based hedonic pricing analysis and offers many advantages in terms of interpretation, improved prediction and the facility to develop understanding of spatial interactions in more general terms.</p><p>Applied to the study of housing submarkets in the city of Aveiro, Portugal, the methodology offers a unique understanding of spatial aspects of the housing market. This is important for understanding neighbourhood choice, housing preferences, and the evolution of urban spatial structure. The implications of such studies on place-based urban planning and housing policy that is informed by a clear understanding of the links between space and housing is a subject of ongoing and further studies (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Maclennan, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Bhattacharjee et al., 2010)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Notes</head><p>1. There is considerable debate in the literature as to which of these alternatives constitute an appropriate criterion, and even whether submarkets are truly spatial entities (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Rothenberg et al., 1991)</ref>. Here, we abstract from these issues somewhat and assume that our submarkets, at the given spatial scale, have a spatial context which we examine in terms of spatial heterogeneity and spatial dependence. 2. Inference on cross-submarket heteroscedasticity is a by-product of our methodology. However, we do not focus on this issue in the paper. 3. We are grateful to an anonymous referee for valuable suggestions that helped us understand better the role of the factor model in our setting. 4. For representative applications using hedonic models in a spatial econometric setting, see <ref type="bibr">Can (1992)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Pace &amp; Gilley (1997)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Basu &amp; Thibodeau (1998)</ref> and Anselin et al. (2010).</p><p>5. For a setting with n spatial units under study, W is an n )n matrix with zero diagonal elements. The offdiagonal elements are typically either dummy variables for contiguity or inversely proportional to the distance between a pair of units, so that spillover between a pair of units that are farther apart is lower. 6. An analogy with well-researched urban areas in the USA is illuminative. A city like Chicago, where house prices have risen in the CBD but grown even faster in the suburbs, would imply positive spatial interaction between the centre and the periphery. By contrast, in Detroit, where prices in the centre have declined at the same time as suburban housing prices have continued to rise, suggests negative spatial interaction. We are grateful to Steve Malpezzi for pointing out this connection with urban structure. 7. See Bhattacharjee &amp; Holly (2011) for a review and discussion, as well as an application to network interactions within a committee. 8. Note that, since the spatial weights matrix is unknown in our setting, it is necessary to row-standardize W to enable identification of both W and the autoregressive parameter (l) in Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">1</ref>The assumption that the intra-submarket spatial weight is the same across all submarkets is not necessary, but retained here for computational simplicity. 9. That is, W 0 is symmetric, which holds if v kl 0v lk for all l "k. W is the row-standardized version of W 0 , and therefore will not be symmetric in general. 10. Here, A 1/2 denotes the symmetric square root of a positive definite matrix A, and A (1/2 denotes its inverse.</p><p>In other words, A (1/2 has the same eigenvectors as A, but with the eigenvalues replaced by the reciprocal of the square root of the corresponding eigenvalues of A. 11. See <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Bhattacharjee &amp; Holly (2011)</ref> for further discussion on partial identification and structural constraints in this context. 12. We thank an anonymous referee whose comments encouraged us to examine the special features of the factor model in the cross-section context, thereby improving upon the methodology and its discussion substantially. 13. See <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Bhattacharjee &amp; Holly (2011)</ref> for further discussion of the conceptual distinction between strong and weak dependence and their connection to the spatial weights matrix. 14. In principle, one can allow the within-submarket spatial weights to vary across submarkets. In our empirical exercise, we abstract from this issue for the sake of computational simplicity. 15. The name of the agency is withheld because of a confidentiality agreement. 16. Flats tend to be located in areas with high residential density, which in turn generate scale economies for the provision of these infrastructure facilities. 17. Given the small sample sizes in each submarket, it is not surprising that many regression coefficients are not statistically significant. The estimates indicate that, despite small sample sizes, it is important to allow for spatial heterogeneity. Further, the limitation of sample size is counterbalanced by the benefits of estimating spatial econometric models (spatial error and spatial lag models) by maximum likelihood, which is computationally difficult on large datasets. 18. The value of the Moran's I statistic ranges from 1 (perfectly positive spatial autocorrelation) to (1 (perfectly negative spatial autocorrelation), a value near zero indicating no spatial autocorrelation. 19. <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Rothenberg et al. (1991)</ref> define submarkets in terms of bundle 'quality' (that is, close hedonic substitutability), and these sets of close substitute units may or may not have any spatial content. 20. The consolidation of a single urban area corresponding to the municipalities of Aveiro and Ílhavo was built on a territory previously organized as a set of small urban and rural clusters, each with its own provision of small scale services. Factor 2 reflects the proximity to such local centres. 21. Paradoxically, the main reason mitigating against more formal analysis of spatial structure using the estimated spatial weights matrix is large sample size. It is computationally very difficult to conduct ML-based inferences in spatial econometric models when sample size is large. Suitable ML computation for large sample applications, based perhaps on regularization or subsampling, is planned for the future.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 3 .</head><label>3</label><figDesc>Housing submarkets for AveiroÁÍlhavo at the peri-urban spatial scale.</figDesc></figure>
