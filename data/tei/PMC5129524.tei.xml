				<p>Background: Head or anterior body part regeneration is commonly associated with protostome, but not deuterostome invertebrates. However, it has been shown that the solitary hemichordate Ptychodera flava possesses the remarkable capacity to regenerate their entire nervous system, including their dorsal neural tube and their anterior head-like structure, or proboscis. Hemichordates, also known as acorn worms, are marine invertebrate deuterostomes that have retained chordate traits that were likely present in the deuterostome ancestor, placing these animals in a vital position to study regeneration and chordate evolution. All acorn worms have a tripartite body plan, with an anterior proboscis, middle collar region, and a posterior trunk. The collar houses a hollow, dorsal neural tube in ptychoderid hemichordates and numerous chordate genes involved in brain and spinal cord development are expressed in a similar anterior-posterior spatial arrangement along the body axis. Results: We have examined anterior regeneration in the hemichordate Ptychodera flava and report the spatial and temporal morphological changes that occur. Additionally, we have sequenced, assembled, and analyzed the transcriptome for eight stages of regenerating P. flava, revealing significant differential gene expression between regenerating and control animals. Conclusions: Importantly, we have uncovered developmental steps that are regeneration-specific and do not strictly follow the embryonic program.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Regeneration has captured the interest and imagination of people for centuries. Popularized in myths, science fiction, and even horror movies, regeneration of missing and damaged tissue is a common reality in the animal kingdom. Nearly every animal phyla contains at least some species that consistently regenerate all or certain tissues and structures <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bely and Nyberg, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Somorjai et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Giangrande and Licciano, 2014)</ref>. All deuterostome groups, with the possible exception of Xenoturbella, have at least some species with the capacity to regenerate <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(S anchez Alvarado, 2000)</ref>. Numerous chordates, including lancelets, tunicates, frogs, fish, salamanders, and even humans are able to regenerate to some degree <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Brown et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bely and Nyberg, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Somorjai et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Giangrande and Licciano, 2014)</ref>. Every extant class of echinoderms have been reported to regenerate <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Candia Carnevali et al., 2009)</ref>, while some species of hemichordates, which are a sister group to the echinoderms, undergo asexual reproduction and regenerate all anterior and posterior body parts when amputated <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Willey 1899;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Dawydoff 1902;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Rao 1954;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Rychel and Swalla, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Humphreys et al., 2010;</ref>.</p><p>When and in what animal lineage did the ability to regenerate first evolve? Was regeneration a stem metazoan trait that was subsequently lost or reduced in numerous taxa or has regeneration evolved independently several times across the metazoans? Porifera <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bely and Nyberg, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Giangrande and Licciano, 2014)</ref>, Cnidaria <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bosch, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Dubuc et al., 2014)</ref>, Ctenophora <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Ryan et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Moroz et al., 2014)</ref>, and Placozoa <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bely and Nyberg, 2010)</ref> have extensive regenerative abilities and, as basal metazoans, these lineages suggest an ancient and ancestral mechanism of regeneration. Comparing gene regulatory networks used during regeneration across various animal phyla will help to elucidate common molecular mechanisms of regeneration.</p><p>Understanding the morphological and genetic basis of regeneration may yield clues to unlocking regeneration in animals with limited or no regenerative abilities, like humans. Millions of people suffer from neurodegenerative diseases, spinal cord injuries, and limb amputations <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Brown et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Ziegler-Graham et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Mahabaleshwarkar and Khanna, 2014)</ref>. Furthermore, aging and age-related diseases will eventually affect everyone. Regeneration may slow the aging process and stem cells present one feasible way to combat a multitude of diseases and injuries <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Rando and Wyss-Coray, 2014)</ref>. If regeneration is a stem deuterostome trait, it is likely that humans possess many, if not all, of the genetic switches controlling regeneration, but those switches have been modified or inactivated in some way over evolutionary time. It may, therefore, be possible to re-activate those pathways in humans using information gained from studying genetic models made from animals with extensive regenerative capabilities.</p><p>We are seeking to identify the morphological and genetic underpinnings controlling regeneration in the solitary hemichordate, Ptychodera flava <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Eschscholtz, 1825)</ref>, which is a basal deuterostome and capable of regenerating all anterior and posterior structures when bisected <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Rychel and Swalla, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Humphreys et al., 2010)</ref>. It is critical to know when internal structures regenerate to use genetic knock downs and knock outs, as well as overexpression, to characterize the function of genes directing the regeneration process. Moreover, hemichordates are the only deuterostome known to be able to regenerate an anterior head-like structure and entire central nervous system <ref type="bibr">(CNS)</ref>. Ptychodera flava progresses from a fertilized embryo to a planktonic, feeding larva that can remain in the water column for up to 300 days <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Hadfield, 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Lin et al., 2016)</ref>. Upon metamorphosis, the larva develops into a juvenile worm that settles to the ocean floor to begin a benthic lifestyle. Solitary hemichordates are exclusively marine and adult animals have a tripartite body plan with an anterior proboscis that is used for digging and burrowing in the sand and mud, a middle collar region with a hollow, dorsal neural tube in ptychoderid hemichordates, a ventral mouth between the proboscis and collar, and a long posterior trunk with pharyngeal gill slits and gonads in the anterior trunk, a hepatic region in the mid-trunk and a terminal anus <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Balser and Ruppert, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr">Brown et el., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Luttrell and Swalla, 2014)</ref>. The hemichordate nervous system is quite interesting. Upon embryogenesis in direct developing hemichordates and metamorphosis in indirect developers, dorsal and ventral nerve cords develop along the full length of the trunk and nerve rings form around the base of the collar and the base of the proboscis <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Balser and Ruppert, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Kaul and Stach, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Miyamoto and Wada, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Kaul-Strehlow et al., 2015)</ref>. Adult echinoderms also develop nerve cords throughout each arm and a circumferential nerve ring around the central disc; however, it still remains to be determined whether echinoderm and hemichordate nerve cords are homologous structures <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Sly et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Holland et al., 2013)</ref>. In addition to nerve cords, P. flava also develops a hollow, neural tube that is positioned dorsally in the collar region. Our lab has shown this structure forms from ectoderm that invaginates and rolls up forming a hollow tube, similar to chordate neurulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Morgan, 1894;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Luttrell et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Miyamoto and Wada, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Luttrell and Swalla, 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Lastly, hemichordates have a diffuse nerve net throughout the ectoderm, similar to the adult tunicate, Ciona intestinalis <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Balser and Ruppert, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Lowe et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Dahlberg et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Kaul-Strehlow et al., 2015)</ref>. The adult acorn worm, in light of these similarities, has aspects of the different types of nervous systems that are present in the deuterostomes. Remarkably, P. flava is able to regenerate all of these structures, making hemichordates a model system to study nervous system evolution and regeneration in this clade of animals. Furthermore, as invertebrates, hemichordates lack the numerous genome duplications events present in the vertebrates <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Dehal and Boore, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Hughes and Liberles, 2008)</ref>, thereby making functional studies of the regeneration genes more tractable in this animal.</p><p>Here, we report the spatial and temporal regeneration of internal body structures to complement the previously published external morphology regeneration data <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Willey, 1899;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Rao, 1954;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Nishikawa, 1977;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Rychel and Swalla, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Humphreys et al., 2010)</ref>. We also include analyses of the transcriptome from regenerating P. flava animals. In total, eight different stages of regeneration were sequenced, assembled, and annotated to track changes in early gene expression that direct regeneration of anterior structures. We document expression profiles and gene ontologies of hundreds of putative genes associated with anterior head regeneration. These data build a foundation for future experiments that may show what genes are sufficient and necessary to start the regeneration program in P. flava. Our morphological data shows the regenerative response to these early changes in gene expression and we document complete anterior regeneration of the proboscis, collar, and anterior trunk. Furthermore, we uncovered morphological differences between early development and regeneration of anterior structures, including the neural tube. The assembled transcriptomes reported here not only complement recent P. flava developmental transcriptomes <ref type="bibr">(Shu-Hwa et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Tagawa et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Simakov et al., 2015)</ref>, but also open the door to systematic comparisons of embryonic processes to regenerative events in hemichordates specifically, and deuterostomes in general.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Regeneration of External and Internal Anterior Features in P. flava</head><p>Intact, healthy, adult worms ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1A)</ref> were bisected in the trunk between the branchial region and the hepatic sacs ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1B</ref>) and the posterior piece was monitored for regeneration signs at the cut site <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 1C)</ref>. The first observable change in tissue composition in Ptychodera flava is wound healing. This process is relatively rapid and takes place within the first 2 days following amputation at 26 C. Wound healing culminates in ectoderm covering and sealing the open cut site <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 1D-F)</ref>. Over the next 3 days, a regeneration blastema forms at the anterior end <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 1G,H)</ref>. Cells accumulate and proliferate in the blastema to yield a new, rudimentary anterior head, or proboscis ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1I</ref>). Between days 4 and 5 post bisection, the mouth has opened on the ventral side <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figs. 1J, 3D1-3)</ref>.</p><p>Over the next several days, cells continue to proliferate enlarging the proboscis and the collar begins to wrap around the base of the proboscis <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 1K-T)</ref>. The collar regenerates in the ventral and lateral positions first ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1K-P)</ref>. Gill slits and gill bars start to form in the anterior most region of the trunk after 10 to 12 days, before the collar ectoderm completely regenerates and closes on the dorsal side ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1Q-T)</ref>. At 13 days post bisection, the ventral and lateral collar ectoderm has fully regenerated <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig.  2)</ref>. The dorsal most region of the collar has not yet formed, but will continue to regenerate and finally close forming a continuous ring around the neck region after approximately 2 weeks of regeneration. The epibranchial nerve ring that that wraps around the posterior collar is visible in the newly regenerated tissue and forms as the collar regrows and not after the collar has fully shaped <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 2)</ref>.</p><p>The internal regeneration morphology of P. flava is striking after the first day the animal is bisected. Both ectoderm and endoderm of the trunk region come together at the cut site and form a near continuous layer <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 3A1</ref>). The folds of pre-existing endoderm are still present and the neural net is maintained below the ectoderm <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 3A1</ref>). Existing muscle fibers of the trunk are still obvious at the anterior end where the wound has sealed <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig.  3A1</ref>). Hepatic collagen is visible below the ectoderm at the cut site, denoting endoderm of the existing hepatic sacculations are taking part in wound healing <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 3A1</ref>). On day 2 of regeneration, the wound has completely healed and the ectoderm epithelium is smooth and continuous <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 3B1,B2</ref>). Dorsal and ventral blood vessels run the length of the animal, allowing blood cells to circulate. Blood is visible in the dorsal and ventral endoderm of the cut site, indicating that both blood vessels are likely supplying blood to this region ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 3B2)</ref>.</p><p>Hepatic collagen is still visible in the dorsal endoderm, suggesting that at least parts of this tissue have not undergone apoptosis or have been remodeled at this stage. By day 3 of regeneration, the blastema has formed a rudimentary proboscis ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 3C1-4)</ref>. A nerve net is present below the ectoderm in this region, at least partially originating from the existing trunk tissue and not wholly regenerated de novo ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 3C1-4)</ref>. At this stage, a structure resembling the presumptive stomochord appears posterior to the rudimentary proboscis and also appears to be derived from endodermal tissue <ref type="figure">(Fig. 3C3,C4</ref>). The hepatic sacculations are clearly visible in the existing trunk denoting the dorsal side and a thick nerve net is still present on the ventral side below the ectoderm posterior to the cut site ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 3C1-C4</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DEVELOPMENTAL DYNAMICS</head><p>As the proboscis grows, anterior internal tissues continue to be elaborated. Hemichordates are tricoelomates, having separate coeloms in the proboscis, collar, and trunk regions. The proboscis coelom is fully formed after 4 days of regeneration ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 3D1-3</ref>). The dorsal blood vessel flows anteriorly from the trunk, through the collar, ultimately forming the heart in the posterior proboscis <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Benito and Pardos, 1997)</ref>. The dorsal vessel has regenerated into the proboscis, filling the coelom with blood at 4 days postamputation ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 3D1-3</ref>). The mouth, which was visible in the external morphology at day 5, is clearly open in sagittal sections at day 4 ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 3D1-3</ref>). The stomochord is a stiff, rod-like structure in the posterior proboscis and provides structural support for the superimposing heart/kidney complex <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Balser and Ruppert, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Rychel and Swalla, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Miyamoto and Wada, 2013)</ref>. The stomochord is apparent in sections after 5 days of regeneration . At this stage, the stomochord forms between the boundary where ectoderm and endoderm meet. At this time, the heartkidney complex regenerates in the lateral and dorsal positions around the stomochord ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 3E1-4</ref>). The dorsal blood vessel is obvious at this stage, flowing into the proboscis just above the stomochord where the heart/kidney complex is regenerating ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig.  3E1-4</ref>). The ventral blood vessel is supplying blood and cells to the presumptive ventral collar coelom as well ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 3E1-4</ref>). One day later, the regenerated collar coeloms can be seen in the dorsal and ventral regions ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 3F1-4</ref>). The proboscis skeleton provides structure and support for the collar and overlying dorsal blood vessel and neural tube <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Luttrell et al., 2012)</ref>. The proboscis skeleton regenerates from endoderm in the collar region and is visible in endodermal inpocketing at 13 days postamputation <ref type="figure">(Fig. 4P</ref>). The hollow, dorsal neural tube, which is found only in the collar region in ptychoderid hemichordates, begins to form in the posterior collar as the ectoderm closes on the dorsal side at 13 days postbisection ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 4T</ref>). These morphological regenerative events are summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dynamic and Discrete Cohorts of Gene Expression Patterns Are Observed During Early Stages of Head Regeneration</head><p>Regeneration of these morphological structures is driven by a significant change in gene expression as evidenced by the transcriptome data. A line graph was constructed to show clusters of upregulated, putative genes showing similar expression profiles along all time points sampled ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 5A</ref>). Nearly all genes in cluster A are significantly up-regulated 2 hr after the animal is bisected; however, the expression level of these genes steadily and drastically declines beginning 6 hr into the regeneration process. A heatmap of cluster A identifies the individual, putative genes and their expression profile across all time points <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. 5B)</ref>. Heatmaps of the genes in cluster B shows overall expression is near baseline values at the 2-hr time point, but then expression increases significantly after 6 hr and is elevated approximately 8-fold higher than control animals after 4 days of regeneration ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 5C</ref>). Heatmaps of the cluster C and cluster D genes show similar expression profiles, both being only slightly elevated after 2 hr of regeneration and then progressively increasing until the 24-hr time point, at which time both clusters begin to show decreased expression levels, with cluster C displaying the most dramatic decrease <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. 5D,E</ref>). However, expression of putative genes in both clusters still remain over two log fold change higher than controls after 4 days of regeneration. Down-regulated, putative genes were also identified and grouped into clusters of similar expression domains. A line graph shows four clusters of predicted genes with very different expression profiles <ref type="figure">(Fig. 6A</ref>). Heatmaps of cluster A show overall expression levels slightly below baseline values between 2 and 6 hr of regeneration and then expression gradually decreases with a steep decline between 3 and 4 days of regeneration. A detailed listing of these putative genes is included in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 7</ref>. Cluster B genes also start off at near baseline values and expression steadily decreases; however, this group of genes reverses at the 48-hr time point and expression levels begin to increase, although overall expression of this cluster remains significantly down-regulated at the 96-hr time point compared with control animals <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 8)</ref>.</p></div>

Expression levels then steadily elevate again over the next 18 hr, at which point expression sharply declines again between 24 and 48 hr of regeneration, with expression values greater than 8-fold lower than control animals. Expression then rebounds over the next 48 hr and returns to around the same levels measured at the 2-hr time point, which is still nearly four log fold lower than expression in control animals ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 6B</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>External Regeneration Morphology</head><p>Ptychoderid hemichordate regeneration is a remarkable process that results in external structures regenerating in an anterior to posterior manner patterned off the existing body axis. This is similar to juvenile worm development in P. flava and another ptychoderid hemichordate, Balanoglossus simodensis, when the proboscis forms first during metamorphosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Lin et al., 2016)</ref>. The collar and trunk then differentiate and the trunk elongates. One difference between development and regeneration, however, is that gill slits start to regenerate before the collar has fully formed, unlike early development in direct developing hemichordates when gill slits form after the collar and trunk have delineated from one another <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Kaul-Strehlow and Stach, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Kaul-Strehlow et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Furthermore, during direct development, the neural tube also starts to invaginate from dorsal, collar ectoderm in the posterior region of the collar before the first gill slit formation <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Kaul-Strehlow and Stach, 2013)</ref>; however, we show in this study that the first gill slit regenerates at least 2 days before the neural tube begins to form in the indirect developing P. flava. Few studies directly compare development or regeneration of the neural tube and gill slits in ptychoderid worms, but two studies state that the collar develops or regenerates before the branchial region <ref type="bibr">Hay-Schmidt, 2007: Humphreys et al., 2010)</ref>. This is not evidence that the neural tube specifically has developed at this point and future studies will need to confirm the timing of development of the neural tube compared with development of the branchial region in P. flava. These differences, however, do show a potential temporal plasticity during regeneration of anterior structures in P. flava.</p><p>During regeneration, cells proliferate and accumulate to form a blastema at the cut site, which then differentiate to replace DEVELOPMENTAL DYNAMICS  <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Rychel &amp; Swalla, 2008</ref></p><formula xml:id="formula_0">) X X X X Nerve net X X Blastema X Proboscis X X X Proboscis coelom X Dorsal vessel X Mouth X X Stomochord X X Collar coelom X Ventral and lateral collar X X X X Heart/kidney complex X X X Proboscis skeleton X X Gill slits X X Dorsal collar X Neural tube X</formula><p>PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen.</p><p>missing or damaged tissue. The question remains whether these proliferating cells are bona fide stem cells occupying an unknown niche that are recruited to the cut site or are these somatic cells that have undergone de-differentiation and returned to a progenitor cell state and then assigned new fates in the regenerating tissue? Numerous genes in P. flava are both up-and downregulated beginning just 2 hr after the animal is bisected. Differential gene expression increases rapidly during the early time DEVELOPMENTAL DYNAMICS points sampled in this study resulting in wound healing and may drive regeneration through the recruitment of stem cells to the cut site forming the regeneration blastema within 3 to 4 days postamputation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Rychel and Swalla (2008)</ref> showed that proliferating cell nuclear antigen positive cells are found in scattered mesenchyme cells throughout the tissue near the cut site by day 2 of regeneration at 28 C in P. flava. There is some slight variation in wound healing and blastema growth times between the results reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Rychel and Swalla (2008)</ref> and here, but the overall results are consistent. Our lab is currently working to determine the origin and molecular profile of these proliferating cells to verify whether these are stem cells or de-differentiated somatic cells. We are using stem cell markers in regenerating and nonregenerating animals to detect molecular signatures consistent with known stem cell lines.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Internal Regeneration Morphology</head><p>While epidermal tissue regenerates anterior to posterior, internal structures appear to regenerate based on need and function. The mouth, which is critical to feeding and thereby supports the high metabolic cost of regeneration, forms and opens after just 4 days. The worm does not burrow and ingest sand to deposit feed at this point; however, they are likely taking in organic nutrients suspended in the water column. Regenerating worms start to burrow in sand around 10 days postbisection. Blood vessels and mechanical support elements for vital organs and tissues also seem to be essential as these are among the first internal structures in the new tissue. The stomochord in the posterior proboscis is vacuolated and acts as a hydrostatic skeleton, providing support for the heartkidney complex <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Miyamoto and Wada, 2013)</ref>. Several studies have shown that, in both direct and indirect developing acorn worms, the stomochord is elaborated from endoderm during juvenile worm development <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Kaul-Strehlow and Stach, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Miyamoto and Wada, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Satoh et al., 2014)</ref>. At 3 days postbisection, we show what may be the presumptive stomochord regenerating from endoderm; however, the identity of this structure is not clear. At this stage, it is not positioned directly below the future heart/kidney complex in the proboscis as the stomochord should be, but rather it is more internal in the presumptive collar region. This structure could also be the hydropore, which is a rounded tube, but that is also not in the correct position, as the hydropore is in the dorsal proboscis/collar ectoderm region and expels circulating waste from the proboscis coelom to the environment (R€ ottinger and Martindale, 2011). It may be that the angle of the sections is not exactly sagittal, at which point internal structures may appear skewed. It may also be that regenerating structures look out of place during the early stages. Future studies will be needed using molecular markers to confirm the identity of this structure.</p><p>This study does clearly show, however, that the stomochord is elaborated from tissue at the ectoderm/endoderm boundary at 5 days postbisection. Tracing the anterior proboscis ectoderm to the anterior stomochord shows that ectoderm is definitely connected to this structure. Conversely, tracing the endodermal tissue to the posterior stomochord also shows that it is definitely connected to this tissue. So the question remains; at what point does endoderm become ectoderm? Our lab is using endodermal and ectodermal molecular markers to answer this provocative question and determine from what tissue type the stomochord regenerates.</p><p>The proboscis skeleton is cartilaginous and provides a rigid framework to protect the collar and overlying dorsal blood vessel and neural tube. The proboscis skeleton regenerates from DEVELOPMENTAL DYNAMICS <ref type="figure">Fig. 6</ref>. Down-regulated gene cluster expression patterns in regenerating Ptycodera flava.

A key difference is that the proboscis skeleton and dorsal vessel regenerate before neural tube regeneration. During normal development this process is reversed and the dorsal vessel and neural tube develop before the proboscis skeleton <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Luttrell et al., 2012)</ref>. Another major difference is the way the neural tube regenerates. During normal development, dorsal collar ectoderm invaginates, rolls up forming a hollow tube. During regeneration, the neural tube begins to form at day 13 as the collar ectoderm nears closure on the dorsal side. It is the closure of this ectoderm that actually forms the tube and not from invaginating ectoderm after the collar fully regenerates and closes.</p><p>This study shows that regeneration in P. flava does not strictly follow the developmental program and there are morphological steps that are regeneration specific. Furthermore, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Arimoto and Tagawa (2015)</ref> showed that the hedgehog gene, which is highly conserved in the metazoans <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Adamska et al., 2007)</ref> and involved with both morphogenesis and regeneration <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Huangfu and Anderson, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Rink et al., 2009)</ref>, is expressed in both the pharyngeal endoderm and anterior tip of P. flava larvae, however, it is only expressed in the pharyngeal region during regeneration in P. flava. The regenerating proboscis tip does not express hedgehog and this evidence suggests there are different gene expression patterns that are regeneration specific in P. flava as well.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DEVELOPMENTAL DYNAMICS</head><p>In the vertebrates, the notochord and dorsal vessel secrete signaling molecules to partially pattern the neural tube and peripheral nervous system, respectively. The notochord secretes sonic hedgehog, signaling the overlying ectoderm to become neural, invaginate and roll up forming the neural tube, while the dorsal blood vessel secretes bone morphogenetic protein molecules that signal neural crest cells to become peripheral neurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Rickmann et al., 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Altaba et al., 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Briscoe et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Schneider et al. 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Young et al., 2004)</ref>. Hemichordates lack a notochord; therefore, the dorsal vessel may play a pivotal role in guiding CNS formation in the collar region during early development. The dorsal vessel may still be directing this process during regeneration as this structure is formed and has regenerated into the proboscis by day 4. The tissue directly above the dorsal vessel in the collar region is thickened with a rich nerve net by 9 days postbisection and this tissue will become the ventral part of the neural tube. It is likely that signals directing a DEVELOPMENTAL DYNAMICS <ref type="figure">Fig. 9</ref>. Differential gene expression of putative transcription factors in regenerating P. flava.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DEVELOPMENTAL DYNAMICS</head><p>neural tube fate are coming on early during collar regeneration, before the dorsal, collar ectoderm being present, and these signals may be emanating from the dorsal vessel.</p><p>Regeneration of the branchial region starts to occur before the collar closes dorsally and the neural tube forms. Between days 10 and 12, the first gill slit appears directly between the regenerating collar and the existing hepatic sacs. The regenerating branchial region in P. flava contains both pigmented and unpigmented cells. The anterior most branchial region closest to the collar is clear to white, while the posterior regenerating branchial region closest to the original cut site contains pigmented cells. <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Rychel and Swalla (2008)</ref> used a TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridinetriphosphate nick end-labeling) assay to show numerous apoptotic cells in the endoderm of the hepatic sacs near the cut site 8 days after amputation. This suggests that, while the anterior most branchial tissue is likely elaborated from newly generated, unpigmented proliferating cells, the cells in the tissue closest to the cut site undergo apoptosis and the tissue is remodeled from the existing cells in the hepatic region. This hypothesis remains to be confirmed, but it will be exciting if internal structures regenerate using both stem cells and somatic cells in P. flava because it will provide a model to study two different modes of regenerating tissue in a stem deuterostome.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Expression of Putative Vertebrate Anterior Head Genes</head><p>Understanding the genetic and morphological basis of regeneration in hemichordates is vital to unlocking more extensive neural regeneration in humans. No vertebrate has been shown to be able to regenerate an anterior head or an entire CNS. Vertebrates that are capable of regenerating a small part of their CNS, like fish and amphibians <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Slack et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Sîrbulescu and Zupanc, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Kroehne et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Lau et al., 2013)</ref>, possess numerous copies of single genes due to whole genome duplication events <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Dehal and Boore, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Hughes and Liberles, 2008)</ref>. This genetic redundancy complicates functional studies of key genes controlling the regeneration process. Hemichordates not only lack whole genome duplications, but consistently regenerate their anterior head and complete CNS and, therefore, present a remarkable model system to study and uncover key genetic switches directing regeneration of anterior structures in the deuterostomes.</p><p>Several studies have detailed expression of genes involved with chordate brain and spinal cord development in the direct developing hemichordate, Saccoglossus kowalevskii <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Lowe et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr">Pani et al., 2012: R€ ottinger and</ref>. These orthologous genes show a similar spatial distribution of chordate patterning along the anterior-posterior body axis in S. kowalevskii. Numerous chordate forebrain genes are expressed in the developing hemichordate proboscis region while chordate midbrain genes are expressed in the hemichordate collar region and chordate hindbrain and spinal cord genes are expressed in the hemichordate trunk region <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Lowe et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Pani et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">R€ ottinger and Lowe, 2012)</ref>. These overlapping similarities suggest that at least parts of the gene regulatory networks that pattern the chordate CNS were likely present in the common ancestor of the deuterostomes and the hemichordate proboscis and collar could be considered an early representation of the chordate head. No chordate has been shown to regenerate an anterior head or CNS after complete amputation and, therefore, hemichordates are vital to revealing gene networks regulating CNS regeneration in the deuterostomes.</p><p>We compared regeneration in P. flava and identified several putative orthologs of chordate CNS patterning genes that are upregulated after 3 and 4 days of regeneration. The regeneration blastema has formed at these time points, and cells continue to proliferate to generate a rudimentary proboscis at 3 to 4 days postbisection of the animal. Sine oculis homeobox 3 (six3), distal-less (dll), paired box homeobox 6 (pax6), and frizzled-5 are all significantly up-regulated at the 96-hr time point, which is just as the proboscis begins to form. Six3, Pax6, and dll are transcription factors that are involved with patterning the chordate forebrain <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Echevarria et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Wilson and Houart, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Paek et al., 2009)</ref>.

Of the 26 putative transcription factors identified as being differentially expressed in this study, 7 of them are known to be involved in head and neural development and they are all significantly up-regulated 3 and 4 days into regeneration as the rudimentary proboscis is beginning to form. It is likely that other chordate head genes are up-regulated during anterior regeneration in P. flava, but they are possibly expressed at later time points as the proboscis continues to regenerate and the collar begins to form. Future studies will be aimed at identifying these transcripts and their expression domains.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>We have shown that Ptychodera flava regeneration is not strictly a morphological recapitulation of development. There is extensive temporal plasticity during regeneration, as well as different modes of acquiring the same anterior structures. Putative orthologs of chordate head genes are also significantly up-regulated just before anterior proboscis regeneration. It will be interesting and informative to discover whether additional head genes are expressed as the proboscis and collar undergo regeneration and we will then use in situ hybridization to localize gene expression in regenerating tissues.</p><p>The origin of blastemal cells in P. flava still remains to be determined. Our lab is currently working to determine whether this animal uses genuine stem cells or dedifferentiated somatic cells to propagate missing tissue. In humans, when a cell differentiates into a particular cell type, the cell fate assignment normally cannot be reversed or transformed. If hemichordates are using dedifferentiated cells to elaborate new tissue, this may reveal cell signaling pathways necessary for the gain and loss of cell fates in the deuterostomes.</p></div>

During low tide, when the water level was approximately 3 feet deep, animals were removed from the coral beds by snorkeling. The light sand cover was fanned by hand to expose the underlying coral and hemichordates. Animals were collected into 50-ml tubes and carried back to the lab with the tubes immersed in a cooler with sea water. Animals were bisected at the level of the anterior hepatic sacs and allowed to regenerate for various time points <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figs. 1 and 2)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Gene Ontology Analysis</head><p>Gene Ontology (GO) (Gene Ontology, 2015) terms were assigned to each P. flava gene based upon homologous PFAM domains and significant Swissprot hits. These terms were used to impute functional categories of differentially expressed genes and calculate categorical enrichment. The GO slim terms used were from the generic GO slim terms list available at the Gene Ontology Web site. GO term enrichment was performed using the R package topGO (Alexa and Rahnenfuhrer, 2010). To examine higherlevel GO terms, significantly enriched (P &lt; 0.01) GO terms were mapped to select higher-level GO terms using GO.db. These select GO terms were then mapped to the significantly differentially expressed genes (P &lt; 1e-5) <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 10)</ref>.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Regenerating anterior structures on Ptychodera flava.
