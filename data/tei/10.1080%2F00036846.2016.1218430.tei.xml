				<p>This article presents analysis of households&apos; intentions to comply with government constraints on the use of urban water, or so-called water restrictions. The data are drawn from Australian cities and was collected during a severe drought. Structural equation modelling is employed to operationalize constructs taken from the theory of planned behaviour and to answer important policy questions related to compliance. The modelled data support the view that attitudes, social norms and perceived behavioural control (PBC) have a positive and significant influence on intentions to comply. PBC has the strongest influence on intentions, suggesting policy directed at assisting households to meet regulatory criteria might be at least as effective as advertising expenditures aimed at shaping attitudes and norms. Importantly, intentions to comply are also shown to have a positive and significant influence on reported compliance behaviour.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. Introduction</head><p>Applied economists have long been interested in the relative importance of different influences on behaviour. This extends beyond simply understanding the rational consumer's choice and encompasses a range of domains including the motivations for altruism (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Wintrobe 1981)</ref>, job selection <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Clark 1997)</ref>, voting (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Chari, Jones, and Marimon 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Barton, Castillo, and Petrie 2016)</ref>, risk taking (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Kanbur 1981)</ref> and compliance with authority (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Becker 1968</ref>). Understanding the motivations for compliance is particularly important for governments since poorly targeted interventions run the risk of weakening the impact of state intervention and can simultaneously generate extraordinary costs. These risks are particularly high when governments are inclined to defer to intervention as a matter of course, without due consideration to the possibility of government failure, as is often the case when water has to be allocated in times of scarcity.</p><p>An extended and severe drought in southern Australia early in the 2000s resulted in most state governments mandating restrictions on how water could be used in urban areas (locally referred to as 'water restrictions'). These constraints included limits on which households could apply water outdoors (e.g. odd numbered houses one day and even numbers others), what could be watered outdoors (e.g. lawns versus gardens versus filling swimming pools), the types of devices that could be used to irrigate outdoors (e.g. sprinklers versus hand-held hoses) and the times at which watering could occur (e.g. days of the week and/or number of hours per day). Similar policy responses are currently being witnessed in California, despite protestations from economists that prices are generally more efficient mechanisms for dealing with scarcity than rationing based on behavioural constraints (see, e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Crase and O'Keefe 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Grafton et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">PPIC 2015)</ref>. Setting aside the welfare losses that attend these types of restrictions, questions arise about why (and if) residents would comply with water restrictions imposed by the state.</p><p>There are several reasons why the Australian experience with water restrictions in the 2000s provides a useful context for considering these questions. First, the parallel with drought responses in other parts of the World offers useful contrasts, especially as similar restriction regimes are being encouraged in places like California (see, PPIC 2015). Second, despite the fact that the Australian drought eased in the late 2000s, legislation for water restrictions remain in place, with anecdotally strong support from the populace, regardless of estimated welfare losses (see, e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Cooper, Burton, and Crase 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Allen Consulting Group 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Harman, Lynch, and McEachern 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Edwards 2008)</ref>. Third, this context offers the opportunity to investigate the effectiveness of compliance regimes empirically and to shed light on the relative importance of psychometric and other exogenous variables. In that regard, it is worth noting that the legislation governing water restrictions and compliance is not uniform across Australian jurisdictions. For example, the frequency and severity with which financial punishment was meted out for recalcitrant behaviour differed between states, with Sydney having a history of employing substantially more water patrol inspectors and fining residents more often than Melbourne (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Cooper, Rose, and Crase 2012)</ref>. In contrast Melbourne residents were subjected to intense advertising campaigns aimed at shaping attitudes and norms about water conservation. This offers an opportunity to reflect on the relative strength of differing motivations to comply and matching this against the efficacy of alternative compliance regimes.</p><p>The theoretical foundation of this study is the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) pioneered by <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Ajzen and Fishbein (1970)</ref>. Accordingly, this article also adds to the applications of TPB, which has increasingly been shown to be useful in understanding complex economic behaviours (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Kautonen, van Gelderen, and Tornikoski 2013)</ref>. The article uses data on compliance behaviour based on a sample from the two most populous states of Australia -New South Wales and Victoria. The data set was designed to provide representation across a number of dimensionsincluding regional and metropolitan cities, water-rich and water-poor communities, and differing compliance legislationbut the focus here is on behavioural constructs from TPB that should be relatively consistent across those dimensions. The data are scrutinized using structural equation modelling (SEM), a technique shown to be particularly useful where complex behavioural relationships are of interest (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Kautonen, van Gelderen, and Tornikoski 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Powdthavee and Wooden 2015)</ref>.</p><p>The article itself is divided into five additional sections. Section II briefly introduces the TPB and summarizes several hypotheses based on related constructs. The background to the SEM is covered in Section III and the survey design and data collection processes described in Section IV. The results of the SEM are presented in Section V. Section VI reports on the core findings before offering some brief concluding remarks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. The conceptual framework -TPB</head><p>The TPB is attributed to <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Ajzen and Fishbein (1970)</ref> and represents a refinement of earlier models of rational decision-making, like the theory of propositional control <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Dunlany 1967)</ref> and the theory of reasoned action <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Ajzen and Fishbein 1970)</ref>. TPB posits that individuals behave rationally to the extent that they systematically consider the consequences of their actions <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Ajzen 1991)</ref>. The approach is particularly useful for exploring behaviour when individuals require skills and resources in addition to the will to act (d <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">'Astous, Colbert, and Montpetit 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Eagly and Chaiken 1993)</ref>. The model has been widely applied (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Ajzen and Fishbein 1977;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Bryan, Ruiz, and O'Neill 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Sheppard, Hartwick, and Warshaw 1988)</ref> and specifically employed to consider delinquent behaviour, like cheating and lying <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Beck and Ajzen 1991)</ref>, software piracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Peace, Galletta, and Thong 2003)</ref>, music piracy (d <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">'Astous, Colbert, and Montpetit 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Kwong and Lee 2002)</ref> and shoplifting <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Tonglet 2001)</ref>. Applications in the context of economics are also becoming more common (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Kautonen, van Gelderen, and Tornikoski 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Karppinen 2005)</ref>. The TPB is based on the presumption that three antecedents attend behavioural intentions: namely, the attitude towards the behaviour, social norms and perceived behavioural control (PBC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Ajzen and Fishbein 1970)</ref>.</p><p>Attitudes are broadly defined as 'an evaluative predisposition towards the behaviour as a function of its determinant personal consequences' (d <ref type="bibr">'Astous, Colbert, and Montpetit 2005, 292)</ref> implying that the relative benefits and costs of choosing a particular behaviour underlie attitudes; consequently, the process of attitude formation broadly mirrors neo-classical utility maximization <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Becker 1968)</ref>. The role of attitudes in the context of water use and conservation is somewhat contested with <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Aitken et al. (1994)</ref> finding that attitudes had a weak relationship with conservation behaviour whilst <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Moore, Murphy and Watson (1994)</ref> found significant correlations between water conservation behaviour, intentions and attitudes.</p><p>Subjective or social norms can be defined as 'the perceived social acceptability of behaviour' <ref type="bibr">(Kernsmith 2005, 758)</ref>, usually by those most significant to us, although wider society expectations also underpin norms. The positive relationship between social norms and compliance is well established in the literature (see, e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Sutinen and Kuperan 1999)</ref> and undoubtedly the intensive media campaigns used to rein in water use in some Australian cities in the 2000s sought to shift norms and even encourage community reporting of delinquent behaviour of individuals (see, e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Wells 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Worrall 2008)</ref>. The ongoing influence of these campaigns, witnessed by an enduring focus on conservation regardless of available water supplies, can arguably be attributed to the successful alignment of descriptive and injunctive norms, as predicted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Cialdini, Reno and Kallgren (1990)</ref>.</p><p>PBC relates to an individual's perception of their capacity (i.e. resources and opportunities) to achieve a behaviour (d <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">'Astous, Colbert, and Montpetit 2005)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Kernsmith (2005)</ref> contends that this antecedent comprises two partsgenerality and strength. The former deals with the range of situations over which the individual can exercise control and the latter relates to the confidence that attends the behaviour. PBC will also be shaped by past experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Ajzen 1991)</ref>.</p><p>Behavioural intention is thought to directly influence behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Ajzen and Fishbein 1970)</ref>. Numerous studies have employed valuation methods in an attempt to identify individuals' intentions to avoid the impacts of water restrictions (see, e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Brennan, Tapsuwan, and Ingram 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Cooper, Rose, and Crase 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Gordon, Chapman, and Blamey 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Griffin and Mjelde 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Hensher, Shore, and Train 2006)</ref>. However, the literature is silent regarding what actually drives individuals' intention to comply with urban water restrictions.</p><p>Given the wide acceptance of the TPB, four hypotheses follow in the context of water restrictions. First, it is hypothesized that there is a positive relationship between one's attitude towards water restrictions and the intention to comply with water restrictions. Second, a positive relationship between the positive perceptions of important others to water restrictions and the intention to comply with those restrictions is anticipated. Third, there should be a positive relationship between perceptions about the ability to comply with water restrictions and the intention to comply. Fourth, and importantly, there should be a positive relationship between intention to comply with water restrictions and actual compliance.</p><p>Previous studies also suggest that there is a correlation between each of the three antecedents to intentioni.e. correlation between attitudes and social norms, attitudes and PBC, and social norms and PBC (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Ajzen 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Swartz and Douglas 2009)</ref>. Accordingly, a fifth hypothesis is that an individual's attitude towards water restrictions, their perception that important others think that he/she should comply with water restrictions and one's perception that he/she possesses the necessary abilities to comply are all correlated.</p><p>The framework of these hypotheses is presented in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. Modelling strategy</head><p>The empirical aspects of this study are focused on creating the latent constructs that comprise the various elements of TPB. This is done using multiple observed variables (items or manifest variables) and <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. The conceptual framework. This figure illustrates the conceptual framework for this study. The framework shows the relationships between each of the factors included in the research hypotheses.</p><p>then investigating the causal relationships amongst the factors. SEM, also known as simultaneous equation modelling, is a multivariate (i.e. multi-equation) regression model that has the capacity to assist in testing the research hypotheses.</p><p>SEM has proven a robust tool for use in statistics, economics and the social sciences (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Kautonen, van Gelderen, and Tornikoski 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Bollen 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Castellanos-Ryan and Conrod 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Cunningham et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Pearl 2000)</ref>. SEMs facilitate efficient inferences from observations and allow researchers to answer questions regarding predictions, interventions and counterfactuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Harwood and Scheines 2002)</ref>.</p><p>Key seminal authors of SEM include <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Wright (1921)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Haavelmo (1943)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Koopmans (1953)</ref>. The technique has been described as a combination of factor analysis and path analysis (including multiple or multivariate regression) <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Ullman 2001)</ref>. SEM is usually deployed as a confirmatory technique, but can also be used for exploratory purposes <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Schreiber et al. 2006)</ref>. Basically, SEM allows for the testing of theoretical propositions about how constructs are related and the directionality of significant relationships (see, <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Ullman 2001)</ref>. It offers a straightforward method of addressing multiple relationships simultaneously while providing statistical efficiency <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Hair et al. 2006)</ref>.</p><p>SEM considers a series of dependence relationships simultaneously. The method is particularly valuable when one dependent variable becomes an independent variable in subsequent dependence relationships. This set of relationships, each with dependent and independent variables, is the basis of SEM <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Hair et al. 2006)</ref>. SEM techniques are characterized by two main elements. First, the technique provides estimation of multiple and interrelated dependence relationships. Second, SEM has the capacity to represent unobserved concepts in these relationships and account for measurement error in the estimation process <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Hair et al. 2006)</ref>. A rudimentary mathematical form of SEM is illustrated in equation (1).</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">x 1 ¼ α 1 þ Xβ 1 þ e Á x 1 x 2 ¼ α 2 þ Xβ 2 þ e Á x 2 x 3 ¼ α 3 þ Xβ 3 þ e Á x 3 x 4 ¼ α 4 þ Xβ 4 þ e Á x 4</formula><p>(1) Here, x i are observed variables, Xis a vector of observed and/or potentially unobserved (latent) variables and e j represents error terms. The power of the SEM approach is that a wide variety of model types can be represented within the same structure, depending on the definition of the observed variables and the structure of the relationships between them and the latents. Thus, the model can be presented as a measurement model, a measurement error model or even a regression model. SEM has a number of advantages over the more conventional regression and/or path analysis approaches (see, e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Schreiber et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Teo 2010)</ref>. Some of the more important benefits include the fact that SEM can (1) combine multiple observed measures of a latent construct (unobserved variables) and then model the causal relationships amongst these constructs rather than amongst single observed variables, which are simply proxies for the latent constructs; (2) use unique measurement errors associated with the measurement of each observed variable; (3) provide unequal weightings for the multiple indicators of a latent construct; (4) allow for correlations amongst the measurement errors <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Loxton 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Pearl 2000)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Determining model fit</head><p>There is contention within the literature regarding determination of model fit, which is one of the most important steps in SEM <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Barrett 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Hooper, Coughlan, and Mullen 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Mulaik 2007)</ref>. In recent years, fit indices have come under intense scrutiny with some authors even suggesting their complete abandonment <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Barrett 2007)</ref>. Others have taken a more nuanced perspective and recognize the merit in reporting a number of fit indices <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Crowley and Fan 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Hooper, Coughlan, and Mullen 2008)</ref> because different indices reflect a different aspect of model fit.</p><p>The Chi-square value is the traditional measure for evaluating overall model fit. The null hypothesis is that the fitted covariance matrix (based on the paths between variables implied by the fitted model) and mean vector of the observed variables are equal to the matrix and vector of the sample. A rejection of the model implies that there are significant paths between variables that have not been represented in the model. Whilst this test retains its popularity, there are several substantial limitations in its application. First, as the test is essentially a statistical significance test, it is sensitive to sample size, which means that the model Chi-square statistic frequently rejects the model when large or small samples are used <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Hooper, Coughlan, and Mullen 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Joreskog and Sorbom 1993)</ref>. Second, the Chi-Square test assumes multivariate normality and significant deviations from normality could result in model rejections, even when the model is accurately specified <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(McIntosh 2006)</ref>. The Bollen-Stine bootstrap <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Bollen and Stine 1992)</ref> is one approach that can be used to adjust for lack of multivariate normality. Basically, it is a bootstrap modification of model Chi-square and is used to test model fit. However, it is also affected by large sample size, thus making other fit indices relevant. Given the restrictiveness of the model Chi-square, researchers have pursued alternate indices to evaluate model fit (refer to Appendix for a review of these).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. Survey design and data collection</head><p>As emphasized earlier, social and psychological cognition models demonstrate that attitudes play an important predictive role in the individual's decision to comply with regulations (see, for instance, d <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">'Astous, Colbert, and Montpetit 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Peace, Galletta, and Thong 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Tonglet 2001)</ref>. Accordingly, in the first part of the survey, respondents were asked to rate their agreement with a series of attitude statements on a 5-point Likert scale, following the approach of <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Hayes and Darkenwald (1990)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Blunt and Yang (2002)</ref>.</p><p>Several topics were critical to this part of the survey: namely, the extent of PBC, the degree of influence from significant others, the individual's intention to comply, and general attitudes towards compliance with water restrictions (see, e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Ajzen and Fishbein 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr">d'Astous, Colbert, and Montpetit 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Giles et al. 2004)</ref>. The survey design process involved identification of existing attitude scales that stem from TPB, conducting focus groups and survey pretesting. Specific psychographic items were thus included on the basis of earlier published work and the interrogation of data from six focus groups, which were conducted in six cities across Victoria and New South Wales.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Development of construct measures</head><p>Perhaps predictably, the three antecedent constructs from TPB featured prominently in respondents' comments during the focus group phase. First, SOCIAL NORMS were voiced by one participant as 'I don't want to be seen as doing the "wrong" thing by others' and another: 'I don't want to be scorned by neighbours'. Second, respondents were generally keen to voice their opinion regarding ATTITUDE towards complying with water restrictions. For instance, one respondent stated that 'Water restrictions are necessary and they have become our "way of life"'. However, the attitudes towards compliance were not entirely positive with one participant claiming 'Water restrictions are "unfair" and "ridiculous"'. Similarly, participants articulated both positive and negative views in the context of PBC. For instance, a negative perspective of PBC was voiced by one participant as 'It is impossible for me to comply with water restrictions', although not all respondents held this view.</p><p>The final items chosen for this section of the survey were a composite of previously employed items (i.e. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Ajzen 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr">d'Astous, Colbert, and Montpetit 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Giles et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Lam 2006)</ref>, albeit with slightly different terminology to reflect the unique setting of this study, and responses emanating from the focus group discussions. Care was also taken to include both positively and negatively worded items in the hope of eliciting truthful and thoughtful responses.</p><p>The interview process also revealed the influence of respondents' lifestyle on their decision to comply with water restrictions, such as whether they had a garden, swimming pool or owned their own home. These types of variables (as well as demographics e.g. age and income) are prima facie related to some of the constructs, such as PBC. Thus, the final part of the survey presented questions that were framed to elicit socio-demographic information pertaining to residential location, age, education, gender, income, number of children in the household, whether the respondent had a lawn and/or garden, home ownership and ownership of an outdoor swimming pool or spa. Another section of the survey contained questions relating to a stated preference experiment, however, this is not used or reported here (see Cooper, Burton, and Crase 2011; Cooper, Rose, and Crase 2012; for a review of this part of the survey).</p><p>The survey was pretested in both paper-based and on-line formats. In the first instance, 52 paper surveys were completed by a random sample of participants, who resided in one of the cities selected across New South Wales and Victoria. The purpose was to trial the specific items and the response formats. Preliminary analyses were conducted on the attitude items with a focus on reliability of items. In this case, Cronbach's alpha was generated to examine if likely factors would load to form sub-scales. This allowed further refinement of item wording and as a result some minor changes were made to the instrument itself, mainly to improve clarity. Once the survey was modified from the initial pilot phase, a second pilot was conducted, where 27 online surveys were completed. This information was used to again refine the survey design resulting in the measurement of each construct as follows.</p><p>Attitude towards water restrictions: This concept was measured using six items (e.g. 'I think that it is a good idea to comply with water restrictions') where respondents had to indicate their level of agreement using a 5-point Likert scale anchored by totally disagree and totally agree. Some of these items were adapted from d <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">'Astous, Colbert and Montpetit (2005)</ref>.</p><p>Subjective norm: The subjective norm measure was adapted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Ajzen (2002)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Lam (2006)</ref>. It consisted of five items (e.g. 'Most members of my family think I should comply with water restrictions') and used a similar Likert scale format to that deployed for other constructs.</p><p>PBC: This concept was measured using five items (e.g. 'I find it easy to stick to water restrictions') adapted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Giles et al. (2004)</ref> and d <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">'Astous, Colbert and Montpetit (2005)</ref>.</p><p>Intention to comply with water restrictions: Five items were used to measure the behavioural intent concept (e.g. 'I intend to follow water restrictions in the future'). These items were adapted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Giles et al. (2004)</ref> and d <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">'Astous, Colbert and Montpetit (2005)</ref>. Respondents were required to specify their level of agreement on a 5-point Likert scale. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> In addition to the above items, the survey also presented a scale item to act as a proxy for actual compliance behaviour (i.e. 'How often would you say that you comply with water restrictions?').

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data collection and sample description</head><p>The main survey was distributed online to a sample of respondents from six cities across the Australian states of Victoria and New South Wales during April 2008. A total of 512 surveys were completed (Wodonga: 54; Albury: 94; Melbourne: 106; Sydney: 102; Goulburn: 51; Bendigo: 105), which represented a response rate of 59%. A Chi-squared (χ 2 ) test of representativeness against the Australian census data (Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) 2006) revealed significant differences in the age, highest education and income; with the sample being younger, more educated and enjoying higher educational attainment, as is common with on-line data collection. The gender profile of the sample was not significantly different to the general population.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. SEM results</head><p>The software package AMOS (Analysis of Moment Structures) by <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Arbuckle (2006)</ref> was used to analyse the data. Initially, a test of multivariate normality was conducted and, as a result, six observations were removed. These observations had Mahalanobis distance values that deviated significantly from the other observations 3their removal resulted in a sample size of 504.</p><p>The manifest variables were tested to evaluate if the correlations amongst measures validated them as indicators of the underlying constructs. Initially, each construct was developed and analysed separately. The squared multiple correlations and the standardized regression weights were used to assess the strength of the correlations between the constructs and the manifest variables. If the standardized regression weights exceed 0.3 they are generally considered to be adequate measures of the construct <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Loxton 2011)</ref>. In total, four items were removed from the models due to their lack of ability to provide a good measure of the constructs (one item was removed from each of the four latent constructs). The manifest variables with the ability to provide a good measure of the constructs appear in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SEM: model 1</head><p>The constructs that were individually developed where then modelled together to empirically estimate the conceptual framework presented in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. Thus, in this case, a confirmatory SEM analysis was conducted. A recursive SEM was estimated and the measurement and structural components are illustrated in the path diagram in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref>. Each of the observed variables in the model is illustrated using rectangles, and circles are used to reflect the unique measurement errors. The latent constructs are illustrated using oval shapes and the direct relationship between variables is portrayed using one-headed arrows (e.g. the latent variable ATTIUDES is determining the responses given to the observed manifest variables attq#). The theoretical relationship posited by the TPB between latents is represented by the three latents titled ATTITUDES, SOCIAL NORMS and PBC which in turn are determining the latent variable INTENTION to comply. A two-headed arrow is used to demonstrate covariance between variables.</p><p>The values that appear on the arrows in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref> are the standardized coefficients for the relationship between the variables (e.g. 0.77 between ATTITUDES and attq1). In the standardized model, identification is achieved by imposing a condition that all variances are equal to 1. The figures adjacent to the rectangle box (e.g. 0.59 for attq1) represent the squared multiple correlations. For example, it is estimated that the predictors of attq1 explain 59% of its variance. Put differently, the error variance of attq1 is approximately 41% of the variance of attq1 itself.  To ensure stable results, a criterion of five subjects per parameter is optimal <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Cunningham 2008)</ref>. The model comprises 41 parameter estimates, which provides a parameter ratio of 12.3:1, such that the observation to parameter ratio is easily met. Assessment of normality on the distribution of the data revealed Mardia's coefficient to have a value of 185.97 (z-value = 77.79), which suggests a relatively significant departure from multivariate normality. Accordingly, the Bollen-Stine bootstrap p became the statistical test for the model, in preference to model Chi-square. Estimation revealed the Bollen-Stine bootstrap p-value to be significant (p = 0.005). This suggests there is a significant difference between the sample data variance/covariance matrix and the model implied variance/covariance matrix. This could be a result of the large sample size used in this study (see Section III) 4 and analysis of the Standardized Residual Covariance Matrix appears to be warranted <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Joreskog and Sorbom 1993)</ref>. In this case, if the estimated model is a 'good fit', most of the residual covariances should be less than two in absolute value. Approximately 97% of the residual covariances are less than two in absolute value, thus this does not indicate serious misfit between the model and the data. (Refer to <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> for reporting of the Standardized Residual Covariance Matrix.)</p><p>This result was further confirmed by evaluating a number of fit statistics. More specifically, the root mean square error of approximation, comparative fit index, parsimony fit indices, goodness-of-fit statistic and adjusted goodness-of-fit statistic values of model fit all met the required thresholds. Moreover, the normed Chi-square ratio also falls within the acceptable range. <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref> presents model fit indices.</p><p>Examination of the regression coefficients for the structural paths revealed numerous positive and significant relationships at the 5% level. <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 4</ref> presents the unstandardized and standardized regression coefficients for the structural paths.</p><p>A reference variable has been assigned to each latent construct when estimating the un-standardized parameters that appear in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 4</ref> (i.e. the parameter is constrained to equal 1). This simply ensures that the latent variable will be measured on the same scale   <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 4</ref> reveal that all of the z-statistics for the unstandardized coefficients are greater than 1.96, thus all of the estimates (factor loadings) are significantly different from zero. These results offer strong support for the hypotheses derived from TPB. More specifically, this finding suggests that the three antecedent constructs (ATTITUDES, SOCIAL NORMS and PBC) had a positive and statistically significant impact on the intention to comply with water restrictions. Moreover, the endogenous construct (INTENTION) had a positive and significant impact on actual compliance with water restrictions, at least as specified in this survey.</p><p>The standardized coefficients presented in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 4</ref> suggest that in predicting INTENTION, PBC (0.389) is the strongest predictor of the three constructs. This estimate suggests that PBC has a relatively strong effect on INTENTION to comply with water restrictions. The standardized coefficient for the ATTITUDES/INTENTION (0.313) constructs implies that ATTITUDES is the second strongest predictor of INTENTION to comply. The SOCIAL NORMS construct is the lowest of the three constructs in terms of effecting INTENTIONS, where the standardized coefficient is (0.248). The results also show that the effect that INTENTION has on actual COMPLIANCE is very strong as the standardized coefficient for this effect exceeds 0.5 (0.507).</p><p>The R-squared value for the INTENTION construct is 0.847. This suggests that approximately 84% of the variation in INTENTION is explained by the three exogenous variables in the structural model (ATTITUDES, SOCIAL NORMS and PBC).</p><p>The covariances between three of the latent constructs and eight of the measurement errors were found to be significant, as shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 5</ref>. The estimated correlations that appear in the overall model are also presented in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 5</ref>.</p><p>The empirical correlation between the three antecedents to INTENTION to comply offers strong support for the final hypothesisi.e. that the three antecedents are interrelated. These correlations could be interpreted as a limitation of the model, insomuch as this could mean there is a common preceding variable to ATTITUDES, SOCIAL NORMS and PBC. In this context, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Ajzen (1991)</ref> suggests that an individual's beliefs about the behaviour are the underlying foundation of attitudes, subjective norms, and PBC. However, he also notes that the exact form of these relationships is uncertain. Of particular concern are studies displaying only modest correlations between belief-based measures of the TPB constructs relative to other, more global measure of these constructs <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Ajzen 1991)</ref>. Moreover, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Fulton, Manfredo and Lipscomb (1996)</ref>'s cognitive hierarchy model of human behaviour, which depicts the hierarchical relationship between cognitive variables, implies that beliefs fall   into a higher hierarchical level than attitudes and norms. This model also suggests that beliefs are slower and harder to change, compared to attitudes and norms <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Fulton, Manfredo, and Lipscomb 1996)</ref>. Thus, from a practical perspective, understanding and appealing to one's attitudes, social norms, and PBC is potentially going to be more appealing from a policy perspective, especially if change is needed sooner rather than later. The correlations between four pairs of measurement errors are consistent with each of the correlations lying within a particular latent construct. For instance, measurement errors e19 and e18 for two of the manifest items for PBC are correlated and this empirical correlation becomes cogent conceptually when we compare the scales for these two manifest items: (1) 'My lifestyle does not allow me to stick with the water restrictions times' and (2) 'It is impossible for me to comply with water restrictions'.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. Discussion and concluding remarks</head><p>The restriction policy surrounding urban water during scarcity does not consider individual preferences or behaviour and there has been only limited research into the drivers of compliance with water restrictions (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Cooper, Rose, and Crase 2012)</ref>. Against that background, there is much to be gained from the insight from these empirical data. Generally, these data offer evidence that the TPB is a useful framework for examining compliance intentions in the context of water restrictions. Notwithstanding the subjective nature of some of these data, key findings suggest that the decision to comply with water restrictions is founded on attitude towards water restrictions, a perception that important others value compliance, and the perceived capabilities to actually undertake compliance behaviour. More specifically, attitudes, social norms and PBC have a positive and significant influence on intentions to comply and intentions to comply has a positive and significant influence on the compliance behaviour associated with water restrictions.</p><p>In this case, PBC has the strongest effect on intentions to comply. Thus, the greater an individual's perception of his or her own capacities to successfully comply with water restrictions, the more likely they are to form intentions to comply. Accordingly, if individuals feel that they do not have the resources or capacity to conform to the required watering times or activities, they may make little effort to comply with water restrictions.</p><p>From a policy perspective, this highlights the importance of giving at least some consideration to individuals' perceptions and preferences when developing demand management responses. Moreover, stringent enforcement of water restrictions when PBC is low is likely to generate additional enforcement costs for only small gains in compliance. Failure to consider the resources available to facilitate compliance could also raise equity concerns and thus have a significant impact on the social welfare of groups with least capacity to respond. Water restrictions, as presently conceived, result in highincome earners being better positioned than lower income households to increase their PBC. For example, high-income households are likely to have the resources to put in place technical devices to assist with compliance (e.g. installing timing devices to switch garden sprinklers on and off at the requisite times). In contrast, poorer households may be forced to give up hours of work (or sleep) to undertake outdoor irrigation. Thus, one approach to increasing compliance could involve increasing the PBC of poorer households, say by offering subsidies for timing devices. Clearly, this is an empirical issue against which the relative costs and benefits should be compared, but the data provided by this study provide a vehicle for undertaking such an analysis.</p><p>In addition, consideration could be given to changing the way water restrictions are administered. Restricting outdoor water use by quota rather than by time and activity would be one possible solution, since this diminishes the specific resource requirements of households to deal with restrictions based on time/activity. Fortunately, this is evident is some parts of the Californian approach to drought restrictions, where quota of use is the focus rather than prescribing the time of watering or irrigation activity.</p><p>Respondents' attitude towards water restrictions was the second strongest predictor of intentions. This provides evidence that persuasive message campaigns that feature the benefits of water restrictions are likely to influence an individual's attitude and hence have an impact on their intentions to comply. Water-saving campaigns such as 'save every drop' have been highly successful in creating a positive attitude towards complying with water restrictions. However, promoting the universality of water 'saving' remains problematic (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Crase and O'Keefe 2009)</ref> and the gains in compliance versus the costs of such campaigns is an empirical question, and one which should be considered against the cost-effectiveness of alternatives.</p><p>Although social norms appeared as the weakest predictive construct of intention to comply, its impact was nonetheless positive and significant. This implies that the social pressures acting on the individual in this context effect intentions to comply, but not to the same extent as PBC and attitudes. As noted earlier, there have also been numerous media reports detailing instances where individuals took enforcement into their own hands (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Wells 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Worrall 2008)</ref>. However, the extent to which this can cost-effectively act as a substitute for formal enforcement (i.e. water patrol inspectors) and the wider social consequences of vigilantism is unclear. Nevertheless, it does highlight that the drivers of compliance go far beyond the calculative motivations associated with fines and that doing the 'right thing' by important others is one of the significant drivers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Acknowledgements</head><p>Thanks are owed to Dr Michael Burton for helpful comments on SEM and Professor Lin Crase for insights into water policy. This article presents analysis of households' intentions to comply with government constraints on the use of urban water, or so-called water restrictions. The data are drawn from Australian cities and was collected during a severe drought. SEM is employed to operationalize constructs taken from the TPB and to answer important policy questions related to compliance. The modelled data support the view that attitudes, social norms and PBC have a positive and significant influence on intentions to comply. Perceived behavioural control has the strongest influence on intentions, suggesting policy directed at assisting households to meet regulatory criteria might be at least as effective as advertising expenditures aimed at shaping attitudes and norms. Importantly, intentions to comply are also shown to have a positive and significant influence on reported compliance behaviour.</p></div>
