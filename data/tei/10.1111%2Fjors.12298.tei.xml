				<p>From 1940 to 1960 across 20 large U.S. cities, rental housing&apos;s price fell, renters&apos; incomes rose, rent&apos;s share in household budgets fell, and, as expected, renters&apos; real housing consumption increased. From 1970 to 2010, rental housing&apos;s price increased, renters&apos; incomes decreased, but, unexpectedly, renters&apos; real housing consumption increased. We find neither demographics nor housing supply factors account for the anomalous post-1970 increase in renters&apos; housing consumption. We conclude that after 1970 there was a nationwide increase in renters&apos; preferences for housing consumption. With incomes falling, renters increased housing consumption by decreasing consumption of other necessities including food, clothing, and transportation.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Virtually all Americans have been renters in the housing market at some point in their lives-as young adults starting out, during life transitions such as divorce or job change, or as senior citizens downsizing from the family home. For low-and moderateincome Americans, rental housing is often the only viable option available because their incomes and savings are insufficient to finance the purchase of a home and to pay the costs of upkeep over time. As the subprime mortgage crisis underscores, homeownership is not for everyone. According to the 2010 Census, just over a third of all U.S. households lived in rented dwellings.</p><p>For most renters, like most homeowners, the cost of housing absorbs a significant portion of household income. In this paper, we explore the changing circumstances of renters in 20 of the largest U.S. urban housing markets over the past seven decades, with special attention to the past four decades. We focus on providing a unique, long-term view of changes in the income of renters, the rents they pay, and the quantity of housing they consume. Decennial census data reveal that from 1930 to 1970, most renters' incomes rose while the price of rental housing services fell. In contrast, from 1970 to 2010, most renters' incomes fell and the price of rental housing services rose. We break down the post-1970 changing distribution of rents into changes in the price of rental housing services and changes in quantity of rental housing services consumed. Here we encounter a striking puzzle that has not been documented in the existing literature. Despite falling renter incomes and increasing prices of rental housing services, since 1970 renters have markedly increased their consumption of rental housing services, which leads us to ask whether demographic changes might have driven changes in consumption separately from changes in incomes and prices. The answer is mixed: an estimated demand function confirms that demographics do matter-most notable, renting baby-boomers and their successors consume markedly more housing than do people born prior to World War II-but there remain large increases over time in housing consumption that are not accounted for by incomes, prices, or demographics. Do supply factors account for the increased housing consumption of renters? Our evidence suggests that supply considerations do not provide an explanation.</p><p>The budget constraint implies that changes in rent's budget share must be accompanied by offsetting changes in other goods' budget shares. We turn in the last section of the paper to documenting these changes in other goods' budget shares over the past eight decades using the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CEX). Examining expenditure shares of renters from 1935 to 2011, we find that rent's budget share generally increases over the time span, peaking in 2011. From 1935 through the early 1970s the increases in rent's budget share are offset by declines in food's share. Since the 1970s, food's budget share has largely flattened. From the early 1970s through 2011, increases in rent's budget share and similar increases in "Other" spending are offset by decreases in the budget shares of food, transport, and clothing. Our evidence suggests that the usual suspects (demographics, supply factors) do not explain the increase in the housing consumption of renters. While there is certainly room for more research to explain the phenomenon, our analysis suggests that there has been a fundamental change in the tastes of renters; they have a stronger preference for housing consumption.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">TWO MODELS OF HOUSING</head><p>With our focus on the long-term changes in renter incomes, rents paid, and housing services consumed, this paper builds on the extensive housing affordability literature. In a widely cited paper, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Quigley and Raphael (2004)</ref> summarize the evidence that between 1960 and 2000, lower income renters sharply increased the fraction of their income spent on rent. 1 While some analysts bemoan rental housing's unaffordability, 2 some note that the increased spending has brought a reduction in the numbers of households living in <ref type="bibr">1</ref> The Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies reports that "the share of US households unable to find affordable rentals has been on the rise for a half-century, with an especially large jump in the last decade" and "affordability is likely to deteriorate further over the next few years" (Joint Center for Housing Studies, 2011). For many years there was much concern about the "adequacy" of rental housing; prior to 1960, many units lacked basic plumbing and heating or were markedly overcrowded. For example, in 1949 many large families lived in small quarters and more than 40 percent of units lacked complete indoor plumbing <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Gabriel, 1996)</ref>. In the mid-1980s, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development <ref type="bibr">(HUD)</ref> analysts began counting the number of very poor households with what came to be known as "worst case housing needs." HUD found that substandard and crowded housing had become very infrequent problems, while housing expenditures in excess of 50 percent of income was the most often-faced problem among these households. For example, by 1993 HUD found that 95 percent of worst housing needs cases were due to rents in excess of 50 percent of income, while substandard or overcrowded housing occurred in only 9 percent of the worst housing needs cases <ref type="bibr">(HUD, 1996, p. 13</ref>).</p><p>2 Among the many older papers in this vein: <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Clay (1987)</ref>, cited by <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Nelson (1994)</ref> as an early voice worrying about declines in the stock of affordable housing; <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Apgar et al. (1991)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bogdon et al. (1994)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Malpezzi and Green (1996)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Orr and Peach (1999)</ref>; and, more recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Vandenbroucke (2007)</ref>. substandard housing <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Weicher, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Malpezzi and Green, 1996)</ref>. Malpezzi and Green argue "America's poor are spending more to get better housing."</p><p>Our approach to measuring rents and housing consumption is based on an extensive literature. Urban economists rely on two primary models of housing: the housing services model and the hedonic price model. In the housing services model, housing is treated as a composite commodity in which attributes of housing are collapsed into a single homogeneous good. In the hedonic price model, housing is represented as a bundle of distinct attributes, each with its own pricing. Prices in the housing services model are generally measured by price indices. The quantity of housing services is then defined as rent divided by price. The best known rental housing price index is the contract rent index of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Prices in the hedonic price model are generally measured by regressions of rent (or house value) on a vector of housing units' characteristics. The American Housing Survey (AHS) has provided the richest source of attribute information for hedonic price estimation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Murray (1978)</ref> offers theoretical and empirical arguments that indicate that neither the housing services nor the hedonic price model is uniformly more general than the other. In this light, the choice of model depends largely on what question is being asked and what data are available. For example, if the question asked is about the benefits accruing to households from living in public housing, as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Murray (1975)</ref>, then the housing services model can suffice, while if the question asked is about changes in the quality of rental housing units over time, as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Gordon and vanGoethem (2007)</ref>, then the hedonic price model can prove especially powerful. In this analysis, we rely chiefly on the housing services model, though we do present some data from the AHS on specific housing attributes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">THE PRICE AND QUANTITY OF RENTAL HOUSING SERVICES</head><p>The BLS contract rent index is a central component of our analysis. The BLS provides rent indices for the nation, census regions, and large metropolitan areas dating back as early as 1915. This long, time series provides a rich source of information on rents and is the best source of rent and quantity information for our purposes. The BLS index is not perfect and many researchers have addressed biases in these indices (biases we address in our analysis of the BLS data). <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Crone et al. (2010)</ref> report that prior to 1977 the BLS omitted from its contract rent sample units that had a change of tenant or that were vacant. Their paper presents a national contract rent index that corrects for the consequent downward bias in the BLS. They find that rental housing's price rose considerably more between 1940 and 1985 than indicated by the BLS index. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Gordon and vanGoethem (2007)</ref> argue that unmeasured quality changes are a primary driver of the bias identified by Crone et al. Using a mix of data sources, Gordon and vanGoethem estimate for the period 1935-1985 a somewhat smaller bias than did Crone et al.</p><p>For the period 2000-2010, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Ambrose et al. (2015)</ref> provide another alternative to the BLS rent index. They restrict attention to new tenants in properties handled by property management companies. Ambrose et al. use their data to estimate city-specific rent indices from 2000 to 2010 for more cities than are covered by the BLS data; they find smaller rent increases and many more rent decreases than in the BLS contract rent data for that decade.</p><p>Gordon and vanGoethem caution against using national rent indices for subnational analyses. This poses a challenge for us because there are no bias-corrected, city-specific rent indices for most of the period of interest to us. Fortunately, our central results prove robust to choosing between the BLS city-specific indices and the national bias-corrected index of Crone et al.</p><p>The city-specific price indices of the BLS and of Ambrose et el. share a limitation of all city-specific Consumer Price Index (CPI) price indices: they do not allow comparison of price levels across cities. Instead, the index is arbitrarily set to 100 in all cities in a chosen base year. However, a BLS analysis, "Three Budgets for an Urban Family of Four" (U.S. <ref type="bibr">Bureau of Labor Statistics, 1972)</ref>, prices a fixed bundle of consumption goods, including rental housing, across some 40 cities in 1970. These fixed-bundle prices, coupled with the BLS rent indices and CPI price indices, reveal differences in price levels across cities over time.</p><p>Another problematic feature of the BLS rent indices has been their treatment of depreciation. For years prior to 1988, the BLS national and city-specific rent indices do not account for depreciation of housing units. Randolph notes that until 1988 the BLS indices' implied rates of change are consequently biased downward by the depreciation rate. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Lowry (1982)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Apgar et al. (1987)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Randolph (1988)</ref> report that the literature contains estimates from 0.3 to 0.9 percent per annum for rental housing's depreciation rate.</p><p>A further problem with the BLS rent index, shared with the other indices mentioned above, is their reliance on contract rent, i.e., on rents paid to landlords. Contract rents often include some utilities while excluding others; indeed, contract rents sometimes exclude utilities altogether. Which utilities are included in contract rent has varied considerably over time and across cities. Consequently, contract rents do not provide a measure of expenditure on a consistently defined mix of housing and utilities. The oil crises of the 1970s and early 1980s increased gross rents appreciably, but these increases are missed in contract rents for units in which utilities are not included in rent. Moreover, Integrated Public Use Microsamples (IPUMS) data reveal that in the 1970s and 1980s, many landlords responded to higher utility costs by excluding utilities from rent when renegotiating rents, exacerbating the downward bias in the BLS contract rent index as a gross rent index. The U.S. Census and the American Community Survey (ACS) collect data on both contract rent and expenditure on utilities not included in rent. These data do not suffice for separating housing and utility expenditures, but they do permit the construction of "gross rent," which is the sum of housing expenditure and total utility expenditure. Appendix 1 reports how we use city-specific contract rent indices, the cityspecific CPI utility price indices, the BLS 1970 budget data, and census and ACS data on contract rents and gross rents to construct city-specific "gross rent" price indices appropriate to measuring real gross rents. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> We then adopt the housing services model and define the quantity of rental housing services a household consumes to be the household's gross rent divided by the city-specific gross rent price index for that consumer's location. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> shows both the BLS rent index and our gross rent price index relative to the CPI price index for all goods less shelter. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> The BLS relative prices from 1935 to 2010 are indicated by the closely spaced symbols in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. Our relative gross rent prices for 1970-2010 are indicated by the widely spaced symbols. The bases for the two indices 3 When using the BLS contract rent index to construct an "equivalent rent" for homeowners for use in the CPI, the BLS makes an adjustment for utilities in the contract rent index. But it is the unadjusted contract rent index that is used for the renter shelter price index in the CPI <ref type="bibr">(Poole et al., 2005, pp. 20-22, 29)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> Since <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Gordon and vanGoethem (2007)</ref> caution against using national indices for subnational analyses, we rely on the BLS city-specific rent indices to construct our gross indices for most analyses here. However, in our regression analysis, we check for the robustness of our results to using a national gross rent index grounded in the national contract rent indices of <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Crone et al. (2010)</ref>.  are set so that the relative prices coincide in 1970. The sharpest difference in relative price changes between the two series are for the 1970s, when the contract-rent-based BLS measure fails to capture the sharp 1970s increases in utility expenditures and in the proportion of "utilities not included" rents among contract rents.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">TWO EPOCHS FOR RENTAL HOUSING</head><p>A glance at rent-to-income ratios across time reveals two epochs for rental <ref type="bibr">housing: 1940-1960 and 1970-2010</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> shows for each of five renter income quintiles, 5 using census and ACS data, the ratios of mean gross rent (i.e., rent inclusive of utilities) to household income for 1940-2010. Rent-to-income ratios fell for all income quintiles from 1940 to 1960, <ref type="bibr">6</ref> and, until 1970, continued to fall slightly for the wealthiest quintiles; the poorest quintiles began to see increases in their rent income ratios by 1970. Since 1970, rent income ratios have risen. Clearly, the post-1970 increases have been sharpest for renters in the poorest quintiles of the renter income distribution 7 ; but even the wealthiest renters have seen the share spent on rent rise from 12 percent in 1970 to 18 percent in 2010. <ref type="bibr">8</ref> What has driven the changes in rent-income ratios over time? We first consider the period of increasing affordability, 1940-1960. Then we examine the period of declining affordability, 1970-2010.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>1940-1960</head><p>The story from 1940 to 1960 is simple: renters' incomes rose dramatically and the price of rental housing services fell substantially. Census data reveals that renters' real incomes rose 110 percent between 1940 and 1960. Because housing is income inelastic, renters opted to reduce their rent to income ratios over this period. 9 Moreover, a BLS index of the price of rental services and the CPI reveal a dramatic 33 percent drop in the relative price of rental housing services from 1935 to 1950 that has only been partially undone subsequently. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> The 1950 Census did not collect data on rents. The ratios observed in 1940 are not simply a reflection of the end of the Depression or pre-World War II buildup conditions; the ratio of median rent to estimated median income was about the same when the Depression started as when it was ending. The 1930 Census did not gather income data, but U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) estimates imply that real per capita income in 1940 was 15.4 percent above that of 1930 (U.S. Bureau of the <ref type="bibr">Census, 1975, Series F-4, p. 224)</ref> and 1930 Census data and CPI data indicate that real rents were 6 percent lower in 1940 than in 1930. These changes indicate a ratio of median rent to median income, rent-income, of 0.27 in 1930; that ratio was 0.25 in 1940, which is equal to the ratio observed in 1990 and well above the 0.19 observed in both 1960 and 1970.</p><p>7 Our computations are based upon households' census and ACS data for 20 of the largest U.S. cities compiled by the IPUMS project <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Ruggles et al., 2010)</ref>. For 1930 and 1940 we use the IPUMS 1 percent samples; for 1970 we use the IPUMS form 1 and form 2 1 percent metro samples; for 1980 we use the IPUMS 5 percent state sample; for 1990 and 2000 we use the IPUMS 5 percent samples; and for 2005, 2008, and 2010 we use the IPUMS ACS samples. The 20 cities we study are: Atlanta, Baltimore, Boston, Cleveland, Chicago, Dallas, Detroit, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Phoenix, Riverside, San Diego, San Francisco, Seattle, Tampa, and Washington DC. Two constraints limited the sample of cities: first, it is for these 20 cities that we have consistently measured geographic boundaries for the metropolitan areas across time; second, for these cities we have needed city-specific price data. Individuals with negative incomes are excluded; for 1970-2000, individuals with rents at or above the IPUMS top codes are excluded from analyses of rents; for 2000-2010, individuals with the highest 1 percent of rents are excluded for comparability with the earlier top-coded samples. See appendix 1.1 of DiPasquale and <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Murray (2008)</ref> for the geographic definitions of these metropolitan areas. A complete list of household variables available from IPUMS by census year is provided at http://ipums.org/usa/hhold.html; the list of person variables available each year is provided at: http://ipums.org/usa/person.html. A bibliography of references to publications, presentations, and works in progress that use the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series projects is available at http://bibliography.ipums.org.</p><p>8 In contrast, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Quigley and Raphael (2004)</ref> report little change among renters in upper income quintiles. The difference in results stems from our use of income quintiles for the distribution of renters' incomes, while Quigley and Raphael relied on income quintiles for the entire population. There are relatively few renters in the uppermost national income quintiles because renters tend to have lower incomes than homeowners.</p><p>9 <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Mayo (1981)</ref> reviews an extensive literature that estimates the income and price elasticities of demand. There is considerable consensus that both income and price elasticities are less than one for both renters and owners, though there are dissenters, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Davis and Ortalo-Magne (2011)</ref>. The range of uncertainty is considerable, with a lack of consensus beyond saying both elasticities are in the range of 0.3-0.7.  Note: See footnotes 7 and 10 for data sources, quintile definitions, and index base.</p><p>As shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>, the decline in the price of rental housing services coincides with a dramatic increase (11.4 percentage points) in the homeownership rate between 1940 and 1950 and a 6.9 percentage point increase from 1950 to 1960. As the demand for new, owner-occupied, single-family homes in the suburbs increased, the price of inner city rental housing fell. Incomes for both renters and homeowners grew in the post-World War II economy.</p><p>Because housing demand is price inelastic, the lower price of housing services induced a further decline in the rent-to-income ratio. Higher incomes and a lower price of rental housing led to increased housing consumption; for example, the proportion of rental units without plumbing fell from nearly half in 1940 to about one in six by 1960.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>1970-2010</head><p>Renters' fortunes reversed following 1970. <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> provides by year and income quintile an index of mean real income for renters in the 20 cities for which we have consistent geographic boundaries and city-specific CPI price indices from 1970 to 2010; an index value of one indicates a household could just afford the bundle of goods described by the BLS in its 1970 budget for a renter family with four members. 10 Between 1970 and 2010, incomes fell appreciably for renters in all but the highest income quintile. That the decline in renters' incomes was a widespread phenomenon is evidenced by column 1 of <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref>, which reports the percentage change in median renter real income for each of our 20 cities. 11 Between 1970 and 2010, the relative price of rental housing services rose <ref type="bibr">10</ref> The data sources for <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> are those noted in footnote 7. The 1960 Census does not report metropolitan area identifiers, so we do not report statistics for 1960. The base (index = 1) for the index is the cost of the BLS low-income budget for an urban family of four in 1970 (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 1972) adjusted over time by the local CPI. <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> omits 2 of our 20 cities, Tampa and Phoenix, for these we lack local CPI data for some years.</p><p>11 Some care is needed in reading <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref>. The data are changes in medians, not means, though this makes only modest differences in the reported changes. Also, the price indices for real income changes 28.7 percent, on average, across the 16 cities for which we have such price data. <ref type="bibr">12</ref> The changes in the price of rental housing services varied considerably across the cities between 1970 and 2010, as evidenced by the percentage changes in that price reported in Column 2 of <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref>. <ref type="bibr">13</ref> Since renters' incomes fell and the price of housing services rose, it is natural to expect that real housing consumption fell between 1970 and 2010. But it did not. The median quantity of housing services renters consumed rose more than 20 percent between 1970 and 2010, and mean real housing consumption rose in every renter income quintile, as evidenced by <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 4</ref>, which reports the national level of real housing consumption for each quintile in each of our sample years. (A value of one in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 4</ref> corresponds to the are the local CPI, which include an owners' shelter component which is much more heavily weighted than the renters' shelter component. The real housing changes are created using our gross rent index. The real changes in nonhousing consumption are created using the CPI local nonshelter indices. Where owners' shelter costs rose more markedly than renters' shelter costs, the real income changes and real consumption changes can fail to match up as one might expect.</p><p>12 Baltimore, Phoenix, Tampa, and Washington DC lack some local all goods less shelter CPI data.</p><p>13 <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref>'s columns should be compared with care. First, the price indices used across the columns are not the same. Incomes (in column 1) are deflated by the local CPI, which includes both a shelter component driven largely by the cost of owned homes and a nonshelter component; nonhousing expenditure (in column 4) are deflated by the local nonshelter CPI; and rent expenditure is deflated by our gross rent index. Furthermore, the table reports medians, not means; some relationships that would of necessity hold among means need not hold among medians.

See footnote 7 for data sources.</p><p>housing services rendered by a specific rental housing unit that BLS deemed "suitable" for a low-income family of four in 1970 (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 1972).) <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 4</ref> also presents the regional rates of change in real housing consumption between 1970 and 2010. Clearly, the increase in real housing consumption is a nationwide phenomenon.</p><p>Such increases occurred even in the cities in which falling incomes were accompanied by the largest increases in the relative price of rental housing services. This is evidenced by the 18 14 city-specific percentage changes from 1970 to 2010 in median real housing consumption for renters in the local third income quintile that are reported in Column 3 of <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref>, The relative price changes and real housing consumption measures reported in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Tables 3 and 4</ref> are based on our gross price index and the local CPI for all goods less shelter. Had we relied solely on the BLS rent index, the real housing consumption changes would have appeared much larger than those we report.</p><p>Substantial increases in real housing consumption when incomes are falling and rental housing's price is rising are very surprising. Do we see evidence of such increases in data that do not require price indices for calculating quantity? We do. The AHS has tracked the size of rental units since 1985. <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 5</ref> reports the median square footage of rental units in 1985 and 2011. Nationally, renters occupied units 4.5 percent larger in 2011 than in 1985. The median size of rental units had grown steadily from 1985 until 2007; at that peak, units were 8 percent larger than in 1985. However, regions differed sharply in how the sizes of units changed. Rental units in the West grew steadily into 2011 (up 10.9 percent from 1985), and units in the South grew until 2008 or 2009 (and in 2011 were still up by 17.4 percent over 1985). But rental units in the Northeast and Midwest have never again been as large as they were in 1985, falling 14.1 percent and 10.6 percent, respectively, by 2011. Why do we not see in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 4</ref> declines in real housing consumption for renters in the Northeast and Midwest? The answer lies in housing's amenities.</p><p>The AHS has tracked numerous housing amenities since 1985, and a few since 1973. <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 5</ref> reports the frequencies of five housing amenities in 1985 and in 2011: having two or more bathrooms, having a clothes washer, having a clothes dryer, having a dishwasher, and having central air conditioning. The proportion of units with two or more baths more than doubled between 1985 and 2011, and such increases were ubiquitous across the country. Similarly, in every region the proportion of units with central air doubled or nearly doubled over the period. The proportions of units with various appliances grew comparably in number, but from higher initial bases. Renters in the South and West have been renting more and better housing; renters in the Northeast and Midwest have been renting smaller, but better units. These trends were already underway before 1985.</p><p>Between 1973 and 1985, the percentage of renters with two or more baths rose from 6.2 percent to 11.7 percent, and the percentage with central air rose from12.9 percent to 26.9 percent; the increases occurred in all regions. There is a vast literature spanning decades estimating hedonic prices of dwelling and location attributes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Sirmans et al. (2006)</ref> offer a meta-analysis of hedonic prices for numerous owner-occupied single-family dwelling characteristics. Using the models in 81 studies, coefficients on traits in semilog specifications with the log of house value as the dependent variables prove rather stable over time (with the exception of lot size) but vary somewhat with region. The meta-analysis indicates that apart from substantial changes in square footage and lot size, a change in any one specific characteristic has only a modest effect on value.</p><p>With this evidence before us how are we to account for renters consuming more housing despite lower incomes and more costly housing? Have other determinants of demand driven this result? Have supply constraints somehow forced greater consumption? We turn first to demand.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">THE DETERMINANTS OF HOUSING DEMAND</head><p>Prices and incomes are not the only determinants of housing demand. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Mankiw and Weil (1989)</ref> emphasize the potential impact of demographic trends on housing demand in the owner-occupied market. Demographics are equally likely to matter for rental housing markets. Moreover, the demographic composition of renter households changed markedly after 1970 (DiPasquale and <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Murray, 2008)</ref>. In 2010, more renter households were female headed, more were black, and more (almost three times as many) were Hispanic. Renter households were generally slightly smaller, though in some places, such as Los Angeles, they were larger. The changes in female headship and family size occurred chiefly in the 1970s; changes in racial and ethnic makeup have occurred more steadily over time.</p><p>Differences in ages of household heads across cities in any year are much sharper than the differences across time. For example, the mean ages of household heads in Dallas and New York differ by almost eight years, while the ages of all heads of households in 1970 and 2010 differ by only 1.3. However, there was an appreciable (two-year) drop in renter household heads' mean age in the 1970s that reflects both the first appearance of the very large baby-boom generation into cities' rental housing markets and the shrinking numbers of the late 19th century and early 20th century cohorts. Cohort effects might dramatically affect housing consumption. The baby-boomers grew up in the post-World War II housing boom; the generations born in the early 20th century grew up in housing far more modest than the stock built in the mid-20th century. People's early shelter experiences might shape their expectations about what constitutes adequate housing which would mean that boomers and their elders would always have very different ideas about what constitutes adequate housing.</p><p>To ascertain whether changes in income, prices, or demography can account for the rise in real housing consumption reported in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Tables 3 and 4</ref>, we estimate a log-log demand function for housing with detailed demographic variables, as well as prices and incomes. <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 6</ref>, column 1 reports the results from a 16 metropolitan area 15 fixed effects OLS regression with robust standard errors clustered by city-year. The dependent variable is the quantity of housing services consumed: gross rent in current dollars divided by the local current price of housing services. The housing price index used in column 1 is our gross rent index grounded in the BLS contract rent index (see appendix 1 for the steps required to turn a contract rent index into a gross rent index). Column 2 contains comparable regression results based on a gross rent index grounded in the national contract rent index of <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Crone et al. (2010)</ref>. The goods for which prices are included in the demand equations are housing, food, medical care, transportation, and apparel, plus a price for "all other goods." 16 Food is the numeraire good: income and the prices of nonfood goods are divided by the price of food. Since demand functions are homogeneous of degree zero in prices and income, we constrain the numeraire good's cross-price elasticity with housing to be minus the sum of the estimated coefficients on income and the other prices. <ref type="bibr">17</ref> The regression also <ref type="bibr">15</ref> Footnote 7 details the sources for our data in Tables 6-8. The OLS regressions are for only 16 of the 20 cities in our original sample. Baltimore, Phoenix, Tampa, and Washington DC lack some of the required price data for each year. Miami and Pittsburgh lack some required data for some years. While using a balanced panel would ensure that the year dummies cannot reflect year-to-year changes in the geographic composition of the sample, we include Miami and Pittsburgh in the OLS regressions because doing so changes almost all estimated coefficients, including the key parameters (year dummies and housing's income and own-price elasticities) only in the third decimal place-and changes no parameter appreciably. The larger sample is more nationally representative and the added observations increase efficiency. We exclude households reporting negative or zero incomes or rents. <ref type="bibr">16</ref> We rely on the metropolitan-specific CPI indices to construct our nonhousing price variables. The exceptions are two: (i) the food price in 1970, for which only a national index is available, and (ii) the price for "other goods," which we construct from the local CPI for all goods but shelter, local CPI's for food, medical care, transportation, and apparel, and the annual national relative importance of the CPI components reported by the Department of Labor. The local CPI's only track local rates of price change, not intercity price differences. To make cross-city comparisons, we relied on the BLS "Three Budgets for an Urban Family of Four Persons" U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (1972) which in 1970 tracked the prices of specific quantities of goods across 40 U.S. cities, thereby providing cross-city goods-price indices for 1970. One of the BLS budgets was specifically for renters and provides a base from which local prices then grew in accord with the local CPIs. Using city-specific fixed effects and the logs of prices absorbs the intercity differentials. <ref type="bibr">17</ref> We fail to reject this null hypothesis of homogeneity at a 5 percent significance level. includes variables for year, household size and composition, and the household head's ethnicity, race, age group, and birth cohort. The omitted category is two-parent households with a white head of prime working age born during the baby boom. The demographic variables' estimated coefficients and standard errors are reported in Appendix 1.1. The regression's R 2 is 0.28. The central message of <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 6</ref>, first seen in columns 1 and 2 and then repeated in columns 3 and 4, is found in the significance and magnitudes of the coefficients on the year dummies (collectively the coefficients are highly statistically significant in both the OLS and IV regressions, with P-values less than 0.00005): even allowing for taste differences among cohorts, prices, income, and demographics, rental housing demand has risen markedly between 1970 and 2010. (Had we used the lower contract rent index of <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Ambrose et al. (2015)</ref> for 2000-2010, we would have calculated even larger demand increases over that decade.)</p><p>The OLS price and income elasticity estimates, −0.34 and 0.18, reported in column 1 of <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 6</ref> are at the low end of estimates found in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Mayo, 1981)</ref>. The price elasticity estimated using the national Crone et al.-based gross rent index, reported in column 2 of <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 6</ref>, is considerably larger in magnitude, −1.0. Despite this difference in price elasticity estimates, the key year-dummies' estimated coefficients in columns 1 and 2 are quite similar-our central result about a shift in demand over time is robust to the choice of gross rent index.</p><p>The OLS estimated price elasticities might suffer from simultaneity bias, as housing demand and housing supply are jointly determined. The price elasticity might also suffer attenuation bias as the price is imperfectly measured. To shield our estimates from such biases we employ two instruments for the price of rental housing 18 : a year-and-city-specific building cost index and a year-and-city-specific construction cost index, both tracked by Engineering News Report and obtained from their website. <ref type="bibr">19</ref> Construction and building costs' correlations with the rental price index are 0.35 and 0.18, respectively. The national gross rent index grounded in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Crone et al. (2010)</ref> lacks the regional variation of the cityspecific measures and proves too weak for sensible instrumental variables estimation. We do not report those results.</p><p>Mayo notes that income elasticity estimates based on current income tend to be smaller than those based on permanent income. Our income elasticity may have a further downward bias due to measurement error inherent in the census asking people about current rent, but last year's income. <ref type="bibr">20</ref> We use the household head's education as an instrument for income; education is correlated with permanent income and, we assume, uncorrelated with transient income and errors from using lagged income. Column 4 of <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 6</ref> reports the results from a 2SLS IV estimation of the demand function of column 1. The IV-estimated price elasticity, −0.39, is only slightly larger than the OLS estimate, but the IV-estimated income elasticity, 0.53, is much higher than the OLS estimate. These estimates are more in line with past studies than were the OLS estimates. <ref type="bibr">21</ref> Because the <ref type="bibr">18</ref> The dependent variable in our demand equations is the natural log of reported rent less the natural log of price. In our log-log specification, subtracting the log of price from both sides alters only the coefficient on the log of price. In particular, it has no effect on the disturbances. Consequently, any instrument valid for estimating a rent regression is also valid for estimation when the dependent variable is the log of rent less the log of price. It is tempting to look for land price data to use as an instrument, given the importance of land's cost in supply. However, a valid instrument cannot be correlated with the part of an endogenous explanatory that is correlated with the disturbance term <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Murray, 2006)</ref>. Land values are largely locally driven, so shocks to local housing demand are likely to be reflected in local land prices. We would need an instrument with both temporal and cross-sectional variation that is uncorrelated with the endogenous component of land price. Such is hard to come by. <ref type="bibr">19</ref> The construction cost index (http://enr.construction.com/economics) is based on "200 hours of common labor at the 20-city average of common labor rates, plus 25 cwt of standard structural steel shapes at the mill price prior to 1996 and the fabricated 20-city price from 1996, plus 1.128 tons of Portland cement at the 20-city price, plus 1,088 board-ft of 2 × 4 lumber at the 20-city price." The building cost index is based on "68.38 hours of skilled labor at the 20-city average of bricklayers, carpenters and structural iron workers rates, plus 25 cwt of standard structural steel shapes at the mill price prior to 1996 and the fabricated 20-city price from 1996, plus 1.128 tons of Portland cement at the 20-city price, plus 1,088 board ft of 2 × 4 lumber at the 20-city price." Many of the components of the index are determined in regional markets, but labor's cost is determined more locally. Since rent is one determinant of local wages among many, there remains room for concern about the construction cost index as a valid instrument. <ref type="bibr">20</ref> The incomes in the regression have been adjusted for price differences between the census year and the preceding year, but not for any growth or fall in incomes. <ref type="bibr">21</ref> The P-values of the F-statistics for the relevance of the instruments in the rental-housing price and income reduced form equations are 0.053 and less than 0.0005, respectively. While the instruments appear relevant, we find that the instruments are weak for rental housing's price (using Finlay and Magnuson's 2009 riv test routine in STATA, which is robust to clustered disturbances, and conditioning on the IV estimate of the income elasticity). The instruments' weakness arises because fixed-effects for city and year in the model absorb much of the variation in both the cost indices and the price of rental housing, leaving IV estimates are only for a sample of 11 cities, <ref type="bibr">22</ref> we also report, in column 3 of <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 6</ref>, the results of an OLS regression for those 11 cities. Note that the 11-city income and price elasticities, −0.37 and 0.18, are very close to the full sample OLS estimates; the time dummies also have similar coefficients in the two regressions. The similar estimates in columns 1 and 3 encourage us to consider the IV estimates from the 11 cities as instructive for the 16 cities. <ref type="bibr">23</ref> The estimated demographic effects are unsurprising and almost all are statistically significant. Larger households consume more housing; single-parents living with no other adult consume more housing than households with two or more adults; non-Hispanic whites consume more housing than other groups; cross-price elasticities are generally small and often statistically insignificant, though the estimate of 0.18 for transportation strikes us as unduly large; the implicit OLS estimate of the cross-price elasticity of housing with respect to the price of food is −0.31 and statistically significant; and the baby-boomers and their successors consume more housing than earlier birth cohorts. This last result is consonant with the basic theme of this paper: tastes for housing change over time. Household heads born prior to World War II have a substantially different view of what constitutes suitable housing than do household heads from the baby-boom generation and their successors; prewar households consume about 10 percent less housing than babyboomers, ceteris paribus. (We experimented with several variants of the age variable specification. The estimated cohort effects were robust to these.)</p><p>Tables 4 and 5 indicate that the largest shifts in demand occurred in the South. Regression analyses confirm that finding. <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 7</ref> reports OLS and IV estimated coefficients for year dummies by region from regressions that again control for income, prices, demographics, and metropolitan area. The reported coefficients estimate how much the intercept term for a given decade and region differs from the 1970 intercept term for that same region. In both OLS and IV regressions, 23 of 24 estimated differences are positive. The largest estimated effects are for the southern region; the other three regions appear to have similarly smaller increases in demand. We reject at conventional significance levels the hypotheses that demand has been unchanging, either everywhere or in some one specific region. <ref type="bibr">24</ref> Implicit in the estimates reported in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Tables 6 and 7</ref> is a story about when the shifts in renters' demands for housing occurred. <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table 8</ref> makes this story explicit by reporting the changes in the estimated coefficients of <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 6</ref> from one time period to the next. little variation in either for estimating the price elasticity. In the model specified without city fixed-effects, we find the instruments for rental housing's price, as well as for income, are not weak. The resulting price and income elasticities are −0.55 and 0.53, respectively, very like estimates elsewhere. The IV estimates for the year dummies are little affected by dropping the city fixed-effects, though they become slightly larger after 2000 without fixed-effects. The weak instrument robustness of our estimation and inference about exogenous variables is consonant with the discussion of <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Andrews and Stock (2007)</ref> who report several alternative criteria for such robustness-one of which our data satisfy. Since our interest in these regressions is in exogenous variables-specifically whether controlling for demographics (in addition to prices and income) eliminates the seeming effects of time on renters' demands-the possible weakness of the price instruments is not a particular problem for us.</p><p>22 The IV regressions are for only 11 cities because, in addition to the four cities that lack needed price data, Houston, Miami, Pittsburgh, Riverside, and San Diego lack construction index data.</p><p>23 2SLS is generally not robust to weak instruments. It is therefore heartening that Fuller's approximately unbiased IV estimator <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Fuller, 1977)</ref>, which has been shown in numerous Monte Carlos to be weak instrument robust as a point estimator (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Hahn et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Andrews and Stock, 2007)</ref> yields essentially the same price and income elasticities as 2SLS does in our sample. For more about instrument weakness and our analysis, see footnote 22. <ref type="bibr">24</ref> The census and ACS surveys are drawn independently across the years. Consequently, each year's data offers independent information about changes in housing demand over time.  Qualitatively, the OLS and IV results are in accord that the largest shifts in renters' demand for housing occurred in the 1980s and between 2000 and 2005. The IV results expose statistically significant changes in every period but the 1970s and 1990s. <ref type="bibr">25</ref> A similar pattern is seen for each region using the results of <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 7</ref>, but the IV estimates are less precise for the year-by-region results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">CHANGING CHARACTERISTICS OF HOUSING SUPPLY</head><p>Since conventional demand analysis does not account for the increase in renters' housing consumption, we turn to supply considerations. If housing were a conventional good and unaffected by government policies, the price of housing services would suffice for capturing the effects of supply on people's consumption of housing. In that case, our instrumental variables estimates would properly account for the interactions of supply and demand. However, housing is not conventional good and housing markets are targets of government policy. <ref type="bibr">25</ref> The 1970s and 1990s were the only two periods of increased income equality (the 1970s) or lessened increasing income inequality (the 1990s) in our sample years <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Autor et al., 2008)</ref>. We, therefore, examined whether increased income inequality might spur renters' housing consumption by increasing the amount of housing the less wealthy renters would need to "keep up" with the wealthier, home-owning "Jones'." Including in our model one or another of various city-and-year-specific measures of income inequality had only small effects on the time dummy coefficients reported in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 6</ref>. Inequality's estimated coefficients were always small, generally insignificant, and of mixed signs. Keeping up with the Jones' is not the root of the observed shift in renters' housing demand.</p><p>Housing services' unconventional character is that they are delivered by discrete, long-lived but physically depreciating dwellings. As housing units depreciate, they tend to become occupied by less wealthy tenants. This filtering process is a centerpiece of the housing literature. Governments' intervention in housing markets comes in two primary forms: the provision of subsidies for housing supply or demand and land use and building regulations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Lowry (1960)</ref> provides a clear intuitive account of the filtering process. Sweeney (1974) provides a definitive theoretical framework for analyzing this filtering process. Empirical work on filtering is scarce, but <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Rosenthal (2014)</ref> provides evidence describing the connections among housing's depreciation rate, households' price and income elasticities of demand, changes in the market price of housing, and the path of dwellings through the income distribution. Unfortunately, Rosenthal's work, rooted in housing demand, does not reveal the empirical structure of the dynamic interaction between housing supply and housing demand that might ideally inform our work. At the core of Sweeney's model of filtering is the notion of hierarchies of dwellings. New dwellings tend to sit at the top of the hierarchy since they tend to be of above average quality. Suppliers of these new dwellings are responsive to the housing demands of wealthier households. Households a little lower on the wealth ladder tend to choose from the slightly depreciated dwellings now abandoned by the occupants of new dwellings.</p><p>Since housing quality is correlated with housing's age, housing markets with a larger share of younger units are apt to afford renters at each wealth level with better housing opportunities. In our data, when the proportion of units less than 10 and between 10 and 20 years of age and the proportion of the stock built before 1950 are added to the regression of column 1, <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 6</ref>, they prove collectively insignificant and the estimated coefficients on the year dummies are only modestly reduced. Besides recent new construction, another possibility for filtering raising renters' consumption is through increased homeownership. Often, becoming a homeowner means leaving an apartment to buy a house. Many rental units left behind by such (usually) higher income renters become available to lower income tenants. As seen in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>, homeownership rates were rising over much of our sample period. Did units newly available to the growing number of renters simply provide much more housing than the units occupied in 1970, leaving renters no choice but to occupy such units? The local homeownership rate, when added to the regressions in column 1 of <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 6</ref>, proves only marginally statistically significant, with an unexpectedly positive coefficient, while other coefficients are not much changed. Shifting homeownership rates do not account for the conundrum of increasing real housing consumption as renters' incomes fall and rental housing's price rises.</p><p>Filtering might deny some renters the lower quality units they would prefer, but it would not drain from the stock already existing lower quality units. In 1970, 33 percent of rental units in the 17 cities for which we have housing price data were of the quality that subsequently rented for $675 or less in 2010 Baltimore housing dollars. By 2010, the number of units of such quality had fallen by a fifth, despite falling incomes of renters and growing numbers of renters in all of these cities. The lost low-quality units may have been removed from the stock or they may have been upgraded to serve higher income households. While gentrification has replaced or upgraded low-end units in many neighborhoods in many cities, the scale of gentrification across 17 cities and across the four decade time span of our study seems too small to explain the changes we observe in the low-rent stock. <ref type="bibr">26</ref> If renters are pressed by limits on supply to consume more housing than they would like, why would the low-quality units leave the stock? 27 A filtering account of renters' increased housing consumption is inconsistent with the documented loss of low-end units.</p><p>One might also speculate that increases in the stock of subsidized housing might account for the increased housing consumption we observe at the lower end of the renter income distribution. This is not the case. We measure the "quantity" a dwelling provides as the ratio of the unit's gross rent paid to the price of housing. We underestimate the real housing services of units with subsidized rents below the units' market value. Since such units have grown over time as a proportion of the rental stock, correcting our measure to account for the actual services of subsidized units would result in even higher estimates of the growth in real housing consumption than we report.</p><p>Many authors have worried that government regulations have made the available supply of housing less affordable for both owners and renters (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Downs, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr">U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Glaeser and Gyourko, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Glaeser et al., 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Glaeser et al., , 2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Saks, 2008)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">28</ref>  <ref type="bibr">Quigley and Raphael (2004, p. 211)</ref> argue that the affordability problems facing renters could be eased by removing the regulatory barriers that impede the construction of affordable rental housing. However, Quigley and Raphael also note that there are no studies that explicitly measure the impact of land use regulations on the increases in rent burdens over time presented in their analysis <ref type="bibr">(2004, p. 208)</ref>. In fact, there is limited data measuring the extent of land use regulation by locality and there is no data on changes over time. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Saiz (2010)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Turner et al. (2014)</ref> provide compelling evidence that regulation, as well as local geographic constraints, impact housing supply and, further, that regulatory regimes are endogenous, changing with local housing market conditions. One question facing us, then, is whether the observed rise in rental housing's income share for renters is attributable to changing regulatory conditions between 1970 and the present. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Saiz (2010)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Turner et al. (2014)</ref> argue convincingly that housing regulation variation across cities has considerable effect on supply. If regulation varies as much over time as it does over space, then changing regulation might account for renters' increased housing consumption. Lacking an intertemporal measure of regulation, Saiz (2010) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Turner et al. (2014)</ref> between 2000 and 2010 with 20 percent of tracts with low incomes and low house values experiencing gentrification compared with just 9 percent in the 1990s. While some of our cities appear to have experienced gentrification in the study, there are no estimates of the impact on the size and quality of the housing stock. (Gentrification is measured by increases in house values, incomes, and share of the population 25 years and older with bachelor's degrees.) Nonetheless, gentrification might have contributed to renters' increased consumption in some cities. However, the increase in demand we observe is ubiquitous, while gentrification is not.</p><p>27 It is also possible that the rents on these units rose more than average. We know of no evidence on the correlation of housing quality and changes in rents over time. An assumption of the BLS price index, and hence of ours, is that the law of one price applies to housing services. <ref type="bibr">28</ref> In 1990, Congress mandated that HUD report annually the number of households facing worst case housing needs, including affordability problems (e.g., U.S. Department of <ref type="bibr">Housing and Urban Development, 2007)</ref>. HUD subsequently formed a commission to study regulatory barriers to affordable housing <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Downs, 1991)</ref>. More recently, DiPasquale and Murray (2008) document a sharp decline in the number of low-rent housing units available in American cities, despite growing numbers of renters. Numerous studies have focused on the dynamics of such changes, asking why, as time passes, do some units disappear from the affordable stock and others appear in it (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Nelson and Vandenbroucke, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Somerville and Holmes, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Somerville and Mayer, 2003)</ref>. These many studies rely chiefly on the AHS and most limit attention to a single decade or less. Some offer national numbers, others regional numbers, while still others report outcomes for a small number of cities. Only <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Nelson and Vandenbroucke (1996)</ref> report on a large number of cities (41), but they observe each of those cities for only four years. Where these studies' time periods overlap with DiPasquale and Murray's longer, census-based work, the results are in basic agreement.</p><p>implicitly assume regulation has not changed over time-they apply the 2005 city-specific regulation measure <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Gyourko et al., 2008)</ref> across several decades.</p><p>Without an intertemporal measure of regulation, it is difficult to assess the claim that it is increased regulation that accounts for renters' markedly increased real housing consumption since 1970. However, there is some suggestive evidence that points away from changing regulation as the cause. <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref> reveals that for all but the first income quintile, most of renters' increase in real housing consumption occurred between 1970 and 1990. (The increase in the lowest quintile has occurred more smoothly over time.) The 1970 and 1990 censuses identified households as "urban" or "rural," where "urban" denotes any city or incorporated place of more than 2,500 inhabitants. Rural households made up 11 percent of all renter households in 1970. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Anderson (2012)</ref> argues that county governments were very slow to adopt land use controls in rural areas and rural land remains less regulated than urban land. <ref type="bibr">29</ref> Because housing market regulation is markedly more extensive in urban areas and their surroundings than in truly rural areas, we expect that between 1970 and 1990 the renters designated as rural experienced less regulationdriven increased housing consumption than did urban renters. Did these rural renters increase their real housing consumption less than urban renters did?</p><p>Unfortunately, there is no rural analog to the BLS rent index data, so we cannot in the BLS data compare the real housing consumptions of rural and urban renters. What we can compare in the census data are rural and urban rent income ratios and how those changed between 1970 and 1990. If changes in regulation between 1970 and 1990 pressed urban renters, but not rural renters, to increase their rent income ratios, we would not, ceteris paribus, see rural rent-income ratios rise as urban rent-income ratios did. What do we observe? The median ratio of gross rent to income for rural renters in 1970 was 0.169; for urban renters it was 0.206. The corresponding ratios in 1990 were 0.241 and 0.283. <ref type="bibr">30</ref> The increases in housing expenditure as a fraction of income were much the same for rural and urban households.</p><p>But ceteris is not always paribus. Shifts in incomes and prices in rural areas relative to urban areas could account for rural rent-income ratios rising as urban ratios did without the pressure of sharply increased regulation. Between 1970 and 1990 rural renters' incomes fell by 3 percent relative to urban renters' incomes. Given the income inelasticity of housing demand, this relative shift would tend to make rural household's rent-income ratios rise relative to those for urban households by about 1.5 percent. Thus, differential urban-rural income changes are not sufficient to account for rural rent-income ratios keeping up with supposedly regulation-driven increases in urban areas.</p><p>Since we do not have a rental housing services price index for the rural sector, we cannot empirically assess such price changes. However, such differential price changes would have to have been quite substantial given housing's price inelasticity and the large increases in urban rent-income ratios induced by substantial quantity increases in urban areas. Moreover, such a marked differential change in prices would have to have involved rural housing services' price rising markedly from 1970 to 1990 relative to the urban price. <ref type="bibr">29</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Anderson (2012)</ref> argues that the lack of land use control at the urban fringe in unincorporated rural areas contributed to urban sprawl over time. While she acknowledges that data on rural land use regulation is scarce, she argues land use controls were largely adopted by urban municipalities not county governments from the 1930s through the late 1970s and 1980s. Regional planning efforts became more common in county government in the 1970s and 1980s which brought some land use controls but the fiscal needs of county government encouraged prodevelopment positions and weak land use controls <ref type="bibr">(Anderson, 2012, p. 377)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">30</ref> These ratios are for renters with strictly positive incomes and rents for real income and rent levels not top-coded in either 1970 or 1990. Such a large increase in the rural rental-housing services' price relative to the urban price strikes us as implausible. Thus, unless housing market regulation changed equally dramatically in both urban and rural areas between 1970 and 1990, the comparable rent-income ratio increases in rural and urban areas argue against changes in regulation being the cause of the observed increase in real housing consumption between 1970 and 1990.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">HOUSING AND NONHOUSING EXPENDITURE SHARES</head><p>The 21.4 percent increase in renters' median real housing consumption that occurred between 1970 and 2010, coupled with an accompanying 13.8 percent fall in renters' median income and a 28.7 percent increase in the relative price of rental housing, forced renters into difficult decisions. Real nonhousing consumption fell 21.8 percent. Changes in rent's budget share must be accompanied by offsetting changes in other goods' budget shares. Which goods would renters cut most, and which least? We employ the CEX to analyze the changing composition of renters' household budgets from 1935 to 2010. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref> reports the gross rent share of total household expenditures for 1935-2011 for each of the five total expenditure quintiles using the CEX. 31 While the patterns over time of the rentto-income ratios shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> and the rent-to-expenditure ratios in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref> are similar, there are some differences: (i) the spike in rent to expenditure ratio in 1973-1974; (ii) the much lower rent ratios for households in the lowest quintile; and (iii) the increase in that quintile's rent ratio from 1935 to 1960. 32 The spike might be due to sharply increased utility expenditures during the first oil shock of the 1970s. The higher rent-to-income ratios for the first quintile are probably due to substantial numbers of <ref type="bibr">31</ref> We obtained <ref type="bibr">the 1935, 1961, and 1973</ref> CEX data from ICPSR. We obtained the 2011 CEX data from the BLS CEX website. The other years' CEX data were obtained from NBER's CEX website. Those who wish to replicate our findings using our code will need first to obtain the raw data from ICPSR, NBER, and BLS. Combining the data from the several years required numerous small judgments about categories across the years; our code reflects those judgments. <ref type="bibr">32</ref> The CEX contains income data. The rent-to-income ratios using the CEX data look very much like <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> except that, as in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>  reported low incomes that stem from including substantial transitory financial losses in income, coupled with the high rents paid in accord with usually much higher incomes. <ref type="bibr">33</ref> With declines in renter income as housing's expenditure share is increasing, renters are decreasing their consumption of other things; column 4 of <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref> reports the percentage change from 1970 to 2010 in median real nonhousing consumption for the 16 cities for which we have a local all goods but shelter CPI. Real nonhousing consumption fell in 12 of the cities and by 21.9 percent overall. The CEX allows us to detail the distribution of this reduced spending across budget items. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref> shows the trends in mean budget shares by spending category from 1935 to 2011. The spending categories were chosen to indicate budget shares devoted to necessities. In 2011, the largest components of the "Other" category are insurance, pensions, and entertainment. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref>, rent's budget share increases over most of the time span, peaking in 2011. Food's budget share declines significantly until the early 1970s then flattens out through 2011. As shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 9</ref>, the total change in budget shares from 1935 through 2011 is dominated by increases in rent budget share (13.4 percentage point increase) that are largely offset by declines in the food budget share (12.5 percentage point decrease). However, since 1972-1973, the size of the rent share increase is two and a half times the size of the food share decrease. The rent share increase and similar increase in the "Other" spending share are offset by declines in budget shares for food, transport, and clothing. The rise in rent budget share between 2001 and 2011 is offset with decreases in shares for transport, clothing, and other spending.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.">CONCLUSION</head><p>In this paper, we document the changing fortunes of renter over eight decades with detailed attention to the past four decades. From 1940 to 1970, American renters shared in the growing prosperity of other Americans. Renters spent less of their incomes on housing while increasing the quantities of housing consumed. Since 1970, renter incomes fell, the price of rental housing services rose, but renters consumed more housing. With declining incomes, renters have faced tough choices. Their increase in housing consumption was accompanied by decreases in spending on clothing, food, and transport.</p><p>The increase in renters' housing consumption while incomes fell and rents rose is a confounding puzzle. Our results show that the increases in housing consumption are far from fully explained by demographic changes in the U.S. renter population. While lack of data limit our ability to provide definitive analysis of the impact of supply factors on the increase in renters' housing consumption, the evidence we do have indicate that the increases in housing consumption among renters are not due to commonly suggested supply factors. Filtering as measured by the age composition of the stock does not account for the increase in housing consumption. A lack of time series data on regulation by city precludes us from directly assessing the role of regulation in increased housing consumption, but indirect evidence suggests that regulation has not driven those increases. Our analysis supports the claim that in the years since 1970 there has been a fundamental change in the tastes of renters-they have a stronger preference for housing consumption. APPENDIX 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A Gross Price Index for Rental Housing Services</head><p>Because our analyses focus on the gross rents (that is, rents including utilities) reported in IPUMS, we need gross rent price indices to separate prices and quantities. The BLS rent index is not a gross rent price index; the BLS index is based on a sample of contract rents, some of which include utilities and some of which do not. From 1970 to 2010, the role of utilities has changed significantly. Utility costs have increased substantially and the portion of units where rents include utilities has decreased. We construct cityspecific gross rent indices from the BLS city-specific contract rent indices. The IPUMS census and ACS data allow us to estimate the fraction of rents in the BLS sample that are gross rents and the fraction where contract rents do not include utilities (using numbers of households with contract rents and the numbers of households with gross rents not equal to contract rent). The IPUMS data also allow us to estimate the ratio of utility expenditures to gross rent (using those households for which reported contract rent and reported gross rent differ to infer utilities expenditures).</p><p>We use the IPUMS data on the ratio of utilities to gross rent for those whose contract rents do not include utilities and on the fraction of renters whose utilities are not included in rent to convert the contract rents BLS observes into gross rents.</p><p>The standard practice in building price indices is to fix the quantities in a bundle and to then track the cost of that fixed quantity over time. We track the cost of a fixed bundle of utilities by identifying a bundle of utilities in 1970 (specifically, the utilities included by the BLS in determining 1970 gross rent for the low-income budget) and increasing that cost over time in accord with the local fuel CPI. So, in this second role of utilities in our work, real utility consumption is held fixed. (We would have preferred fixing quantities in the housing bundle at some midpoint of the period under study, but the last BLS cross-city budget study was done in 1970.)</p><p>We fix the quantity of rental housing whose cost we track over time by examining hypothetical renters with the BLS 1970 low-income budget. The gross rent for this unit in 1970, GR 70 , is provided by the BLS budget data. We assume that in 1970 contract rents that included utilities did so correctly, on average. Consequently, across units like the unit in the BLS budget, the mean contract rent observed by BLS would have been</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">CR 70 = GR 70 − f 70 U 70 ,</formula><p>where f 70 is the fraction of renters whose rent does not include utilities in 1970 and U 70 is the cost of utilities in the BLS 1970 budget. We use an estimate for U 70 :</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">U 70 = p 70 GR 70 ,</formula><p>where p 70 is the fraction of 1970 gross rent that is utilities for those households in the IPUMS for whom contract rent does not equal gross rent. (These estimates overlook the endogeneity of utilities' inclusion in rent that might result in utility costs differing between units including utilities in rent and units not including utilities in rent.)</p><p>The BLS rent index implies that contract rents changed between 1970 and 1980 at some rate g 80 , so that CR 80 = (1 + g 80 )CR 70 and GR 80 = CR 80 + f 80 U 80 = (1 + g 80 ) CR 70 + f 80 U 80 . (A1)</p><p>From the IPUMS, we estimate that</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">GR 80 = U 80 / p 80 . (A2)</formula><p>Solving <ref type="formula">1</ref>and <ref type="formula">2</ref> Iterating this procedure from year to year yields a series of gross rent estimates. However, these gross rent estimates do not hold the quantity of utilities fixed. The IPUMS ratios of utilities to gross rent reflect changes in the prices of utilities and changes in the quantities of utilities. A proper gross rent index would be based upon a fixed quantity of utilities. To obtain such a fixed quantity series of gross rents, we obtain the evolving cost of a fixed quantity of utilities,Ũ t , by inflating U 70 over time using the local CPI fuel price index. We then subtract (A3) from (A4) and addŨ t to obtain the time path of the gross rent of the housing service embodied in the 1970 BLS budget rental unit,R t .</p><p>In constructing its rent index, BLS began accounting for depreciation of the units in 1988. We account for depreciation from 1970 to 1987. For years prior to 1988, we adjust the quantity of housing absent utilities to reflect a 0.7 percent annual decline in the quantity of housing services provided by the BLS units. This rate of decline is in the mid-range of 0.5-0.9 percent per annum that <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Apgar et al. (1987)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">DiPasquale and Wheaton (1992)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Lowry (1982)</ref> report as estimates found in the literature for rental housing's annual depreciation rate. We have also computed gross rent price indices assuming depreciation rates of 0.5 and 0.9 percent; our qualitative results persist if these indices are used in lieu of the index based upon a 0.7 percent depreciation rate.
