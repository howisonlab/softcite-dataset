				<p>Purpose: Appropriate animal models of atherosclerotic plaque are crucial to investigating the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis, as well as for the evaluation of the efficacy and safety of vascular devices. We aimed to develop a novel animal model that would be suitable for the study of advanced atherosclerotic lesions in vivo. Materials and Methods: Atherosclerotic plaque was induced in 24 iliac arteries from 12 rabbits by combining a high cholesterol diet, endothelial denudation, and injection into the vessel wall with either saline (n=5), olive oil (n=6), or inflammatory proteins [n=13, high-mobility group protein B1 (HMGB1) n=8 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α n=5] using a Cricket TM Micro-infusion catheter. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) was performed to detect plaque characteristics after 4 weeks, and all tissues were harvested for histological evaluation. Results: Advanced plaque was more frequently observed in the group injected with inflammatory proteins. Macrophage infiltration was present to a higher degree in the HMGB1 and TNF-α groups, compared to the oil or saline group (82.1±5.1% and 94.6± 2.2% compared to 49.6±14.0% and 46.5±9.6%, p-value&lt;0.001), using RAM11 antibody staining. On OCT, lipid rich plaques were more frequently detected in the inflammatory protein group [saline group: 2/5 (40%), oil group: 3/5 (50%), HMGB1 group: 6/8 (75%), and TNF-α group: 5/5 (100%)]. Conclusion: These data indicate that this rabbit model of atherosclerotic lesion formation via direct injection of pro-inflammatory proteins into the vessel wall is useful for in vivo studies investigating atherosclerosis.</p>

To overcome these limitations, a reproducible porcine model of atherosclerosis, which utilized the direct injection of complex lipids into the vascular wall, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> was developed. Additionally, this approach resulted in focal lesions that were located in positively remodeled vessels that have increased neovascularization, as well as the release of pro-inflammatory chemokines. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> Atherosclerosis is a complex inflammatory and immune response disease, and plaque vulnerability is linked with increased levels of inflammation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> As such, the direct injection of pro-inflammatory proteins into the vessel wall may trigger a more potent inflammatory response and consistently augment the atherosclerotic process within a short period of time. To date, no study has investigated the effects of injecting pro-inflammatory proteins directly into the vascular wall on inflammation and atherosclerosis. In this study, we selected the pro-inflammatory proteins high-mobility group protein B1 (HMGB1) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, because both of these chemokines are well known to promote the inflammatory process and mediate atherosclerosis. This study was designed to investigate the effect of injecting pro-inflammatory proteins into the vessel wall on the development of advanced plaques and inflammation.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental animal model</head><p>A total of 16 male New Zealand white rabbits (12 months old, weighing 3.0-4.0 kg) were used in the study. Four rabbits did not complete the protocol. Finally, 12 rabbits were included in this study. The experimental protocol is shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>.</p><p>All rabbits were given a high cholesterol diet (2% cholesterol, Scientific Animal Food &amp; Engineering, Augy, France) 1 week prior to and 4 weeks after the balloon injury and intramuscular injection. After premedication with antibiotics and analgesics, anesthesia was induced by intramuscular injection with an appropriate mixture of tiletamine-zolazepam (10 mg/kg, Zoletil ® , Virvac, Fort Worth, TX, USA) and xylazine (0.5 mg/kg , Rompun ® , Bayer, Leverkusen, Germany), then maintained with 1-2% of isoflurane (Forane ® , JW Pharm, Seoul, Korea) and oxygen. Access to the iliac artery was obtained via the carotid artery, using a sterile surgical technique. Heparin (150 units/kg) was injected to maintain an activated clotting time &gt;250 s before catheterization. Based on quantitative angiography (QA), an oversized balloon inflation with a 1.3:1.0 (balloon:artery ratio) was applied two times for 30 seconds within both iliac arteries using a 15-mm-length balloon. Following balloon injury, oil, inflammatory proteins+oil, or saline was delivered to each iliac artery using a Cricket TM Micro-Infusion catheter (Mercator Medsystems, San Leandro, CA, USA) over a guidewire under fluoroscopic guidance. Following the compound delivery, angiography and OCT examination were performed. All animals received 40 mg aspirin (~10 mg/kg) and clopidogrel (75 mg/daily) after the procedure. The animals were euthanized 4-weeks post-procedure, and the iliac arteries were harvested.</p><p>The study protocol was approved by the local institutional animal care and use committee (Medi Kinetics, MK-IACUC: 111027-001 and Cardiovascular Production Evaluation Center, Yonsei University College of Medicine). All animals received humane care in compliance with the Animal Welfare Act and the "Principles of Laboratory Animal Care" formulated by the Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources (National Research Council, NIH Publication No. 85-23, revised 1996).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Intramural vascular injection</head><p>A total of 32 iliac arteries from 16 rabbits were randomly assigned into four groups: saline injection group (Daihan Pharm Co., Seoul, Korea, n=8), olive oil injection group (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA, n=8), HMGB1 (A&amp;RT, Daejeon, Korea)+oil injection (n=8), and the TNF-α (Prospec, Ness-Ziona, Israel)+oil group (n=8).

Upon arrival to the animal facility, rabbits were started on a daily high cholesterol diet for 5 weeks. One week later, balloon injury was induced, and inflammatory proteins were injected. Body weight and serums were assessed before the high cholesterol diet and before the sacrifice at 5 weeks. OCT was assessed at the beginning and end of the study. Animals were euthanized 4 weeks after the injection procedure, and iliac arteries were harvested at that time. OCT, optical coherence tomography. </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">v v v</formula><p>dovascular intramural injection using a Cricket TM Micro-Infusion catheter was performed. The infusion catheter is designed to deliver the material to the adventitia of the vessel wall via needle injection. The Cricket TM Micro-Infusion catheter was placed within the balloon-injured site, and the balloon was inflated. The vessel wall was penetrated by the needle. Complete occlusion after balloon inflation and shape of needle were confirmed by angiography. The infusion catheter system delivered 200 μL of saline, oil, HMGB1, or TNF-α (inflammatory proteins, 20 ug/200 uL dilution into saline) into the vessel wall. Each animal received two treatments within each iliac artery. The circumferential injection of solutions was repeated four times within the injured vessel segment to achieve a total of 1 cc of the target dose. Angiography and optical coherence tomography (OCT) were performed twice: immediately post-procedure and 4-weeks post-procedure. After the autopsy, 15 mm of vessel was dissected into three equal parts (5 mm each) and stored.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Blood analysis</head><p>Plasma levels of total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) were measured by DRI-CHEM 4000i (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan) (TCHO-P, TG-P, HDL-C-PD) in blood samples before, 1 week, and 5 weeks after the introduction of the high cholesterol diet. Blood samples were collected from the carotid arteries of the rabbits.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Histological analysis</head><p>Under anesthesia, all animals were euthanized immediately after the follow-up imaging was complete. Iliac vessels (5 mm in length) were fixed by continued perfusion with 10% normal buffered formalin. To assure the proper identification, right iliac arteries were marked at the distal end with a 4-0 silk suture, and then both arteries were carefully cut and immersion-fixed overnight before the histological processing. For paraffin embedding, 4 mm in length of vessel was placed intact into a single cassette, and processed through a graded series of alcohols and xylenes. After processing, the specimen was embedded as a single paraffin block. Paraffin sections were cut on a microtome at 4 microns, mounted on microscope slides (Superfrost Plus, Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining, Masson's trichrome staining, Movat's pentachrome staining, and Sirius red stain for collagens. Frozen sections were cut on a microtome at 10 microns, and mounted a 1 mm length of vessel for Oil red O lipid staining.</p><p>In addition, the induction of inflammation and the expression of HMGB1 and TNF-α were evaluated in arterial samples using a mouse monoclonal anti-rabbit macrophage antibody (RAM11, DAKO, Santa Clara, CA, USA), the anti-body for HMGB1 (NOVUS, Littleton, CO, USA), TNF-α (ABCAM, Cambridge, MA, USA), and the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE, LSBio, Seattle, WA, USA). Changes in smooth muscle acting (SMA) were also evaluated with the anti-SMA (AB-CAM, Cambridge, MA, USA), using a general immunohistochemistry (IHC) protocol (Supplementary Method 1, only online).</p><p>Atherosclerotic plaques types were classified into early (type II, fatty streak, and type III, pre-atheroma) and advanced (type IV, atheroma; type V, fibroatheroma) plaques according to the American Heart Association (AHA) criteria. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> All pathologic slides were reviewed by one pathologist (S.H.K.) to determine the histomorphometric analysis and AHA classification.</p><p>The cross-sectional areas [external elastic lamina (EEL), internal elastic lamina (IEL) stenosis and lumen] were measured on stained slides using digital morphological analysis.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reverse transcription-PCR analysis</head><p>Total RNA was isolated from the iliac vessels (5 mm length) using a tissue grinder motor (Bel-Art Products, Wayne, NJ, USA) and QIAzol lysis reagent (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). The concentration of RNA was measured by Nanodrop 2000/2000c (Thermo Scientific, Long Beach, NY, USA). Complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized using Quantitect Reverse Transcription (QIAGEN) and PCR using the AccuPower PCR Premix (Bioneer, Daejeon, Korea). All PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on 2% agarose gels diluted in TAE. Sizes were compared to an included 100 bp DNA ladder (DYNE Bio, Seongnam, Korea), and PCR products were visualized using Loading STAR (DYNE Bio, Seongnam, Korea). The rabbit gene primer sequences used for PCR were: RAGE, forward 5'-ATGGTCACCCTCAGATCA-3' and reverse 5'-CT GAAGAGAACCTGGGAG-3'; HMGB1, forward 5'-GTTCTGAG TATCGCCCCAAA-3' and reverse 5'-TCCTCCTCATCCTCTTC GTC-3'; TNF-α, forward 5'-ATGGTCACCCTCAGATCA-3' and reverse 5'-CTGAAGAGAACCTGGGAG-3'; GAPDH, forward 5'-AGGTCATCCACGACCACTTC-3' and reverse 5'-GTGAGTT TCCCGTTCAGCTC-3' . Relative mRNA levels were determined by comparison to the GAPDH mRNA.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Western blot analysis</head><p>Iliac vessels (5 mm length) were homogenized using Tissue Grinder Motor (Bel-Art Products, Wayne, NJ, USA) and lysed with RIPA buffer (Biosesang, Seongnam, Korea) containing a cOmplete Mini, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)-free protease inhibitor cocktail ® (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). The protein concentrations were measured by bicinchoninic acid protein assay. Iliac artery lysates were loaded and separated on 12% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred onto Immuno-Blot ® PVDF Membrane (BIO-RAD, Hercules, CA, USA). Membranes were blocked by a 5% skim milk (Noble Bio, Hwaseong, Korea) dilution in Tris-Buffered Saline and Tween 20 (TBS-T) at room temperature for 1 hour, and were subsequently washed three times in TBS-T. Membranes were incubated in TBS-T with primary antibodies against HMGB1, TNF-α, and RAGE (all 1:1000 in 5% BSA, Biosesang, Seongnam, Korea) overnight at 4°C.

Using the guiding catheter for magnification-calibration, the reference vessel diameter (RD) and minimum luminal diameter (MLD) were measured from diastolic frames in a single, matched view showing the smallest MLD. Percent diameter of stenosis was calculated according to the following formula: percent diameter stenosis=[(mean RD-MLD)/mean RD]×100, mean RD=(proximal RD+distal vessel diameter)/2.</p></div>

The OCT catheter was pulled back at 20 mm/s, and OCT images were generated at 100 frames/s. Contrast media were continuously flushed through a guiding catheter at a rate of 4-5 mL/s for 3-4 seconds. Images were continuously acquired and stored digitally for subsequent analyses. All OCT images were analyzed at a core laboratory (Cardiovascular Research Center, Seoul, Korea) by analysts who were blinded to procedural information. The histological images were compared to their corresponding OCT pullback lesion segments until the best and closest visual match was found <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 2)</ref>. This match was performed with the consideration to the anatomical features (luminal shape, neointimal thickness, presence of neovascularization, etc.), the proximity to side branches, and the length from the balloon injury edge to the location of the histology samples (provided by the histological laboratory). Plaques were classified as 1) fibrous (homogeneous, high backscattering region) or 2) lipid (low-signal region with diffuse border). <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> Macrophage infiltration within the lesion was characterized by increased signal intensity within the lesion accompanied by the heterogeneous backward shadows. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>There are two key findings from this study. First, our data suggest that the induction of inflammation via direct injection of pro-inflammatory proteins, such as HMGB1 or TNF-α, into the iliac artery increases macrophage infiltration and accelerates inflammation within the vessel wall. Second, advanced atheromatous plaques, including lipid rich plaques, were more frequently induced by the injection of pro-inflammatory proteins, compared to the controls. The current study may provide a useful in vivo modality for developing advanced atheromatous plaques by direct injection of pro-inflammatory proteins.</p><p>A rabbit model of atherosclerosis has been proposed to easily induce foam cell-rich plaques, because of its unique sensitivity to hypercholesterolemia. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> The iliac artery or aorta of the rabbit is frequently used as a model for preclinical cardiovascular research studies due to its similar morphology with the coronary artery of humans. 8 However, its use is limited by inter-individual variations in plasma cholesterol levels and lesion characteristics in response to a cholesterol diet.

In this study, in order to overcome this variability of developed atheromatous plaque, we modified the existing protocols in animal models. Previously, Granada, et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> proposed a method for inducing atherosclerotic plaques by combining balloon injury and the vascular wall injection of lipidic substances in a swine model. In their study, atherosclerotic lesions containing inflammatory cells, positive remodeling, and neovascularization all developed and resembled the early stages of human atherosclerosis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> Furthermore, the intramural injection of complex lipids into the coronary arteries induced an increased expression of vascular endothelial grow factor (VEGF) and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1). <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> However, to the best of our knowledge, no study has investigated the induction of an atherosclerotic plaque in a rabbit model by the direct injection of a lipidic substance or pro-inflammatory proteins into the vessel wall. We observed the de-veloped plaque area to be similar among the groups injected with either saline, lipid, or lipid+pro-inflammatory protein. However, macrophage accumulation was more prominent in the pro-inflammatory injected groups. Furthermore, the proinflammatory groups had an increased expression of TNF-α and HMGB1 within the intima and media of the vessel, compared with either the saline or oil injected groups. This finding suggests that direct tissue injection of pro-inflammatory proteins may induce potent inflammation and promote the development of an advanced atheromatous plaque.</p><p>We applied two pro-inflammatory proteins in this study, TNF-α and HMGB1. TNF-α is a well-known potent pro-inflammatory cytokine involved in the pathogenesis of arteriosclerosis. It promotes the inflammatory response, which causes many of the clinical problems associated with autoimmune disorders, such as inflammatory disease. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> HMGB1 is a potent proinflammatory protein ligand that mediates inflammation by activating innate immunity receptors, such as toll-like receptor (TLR) and RAGE. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> HMGB1 passively diffuses out of necrotic or apoptotic cells.

These data suggest that the HMBG1 injection may induce an upregulation of RAGE expression and activation, resulting in an increased recruitment of macrophages through the expression of cytokines and cell adhesion molecules. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> OCT is a well-established, accurate imaging modality with a high resolution, capable of evaluating the characteristics of atheromatous plaques in clinical situations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> Here, using OCT, we were able to show that HMGB1 and TNF-α groups had a higher incidence of lipid rich plaques, compared to both the oil or saline groups. This finding confirmed histological studies that showed HMGB1 and TNF-α groups have more ad-vanced plaques, compared to the saline and oil groups. OCT indicated that the diameter and area of the stenosis were not different between the four groups.</p><p>The main limitation of this study was its short duration, which did not allow for the development of an established necrotic core, intra-plaque hemorrhage, or calcified plaques. Furthermore, plaque rupture or thrombus, which is the main pathogenic mechanism of acute coronary syndrome, was not observed in this experimental model. However, these limitations do not detract from the central merit of this work, which shows that a consistent model of advanced atherosclerosis has been developed. Therefore, our study seems as a cost-effective and short-time method that induces atherosclerotic lesions in rabbit. The lack of adequate medium to large sized animal models for atherosclerosis has been a major limitation for animal research in the cardiovascular field. We believe this model may be useful for further study investigating the pathogenesis and treatment of atherosclerosis. Also, it could be useful E 100 50 0 V IV III II I</p></div>
