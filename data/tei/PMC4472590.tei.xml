			<abstract>
				<p>This study aimed to investigate the relationship between kyphosis and lordosis measured by using a flexible ruler and musculoskeletal pain in students of Hamadan University of Medical Sciences. Overview of Literature: The spine supports the body during different activities by maintaining appropriate body alignment and posture. Normal alignment of the spine depends on its structural, muscular, bony, and articular performance. Methods: Two hundred forty-one students participated in this study. A single examiner evaluated the angles of lumbar lordosis and thoracic kyphosis by using a flexible ruler. To determine the severity and frequency of pain in low-back and inter-scapular regions, a tailor-made questionnaire with visual analog scale was used. Finally, using the Kendall correlation coefficient, the data were statistically analyzed. Results: The mean value of lumbar lordosis was 34.46°±12.61° in female students and 22.46°±9.9° in male students. The mean value of lumbar lordosis significantly differed between female and male students (p&lt;0.001). However, there was no difference in the level of the thoracic curve (p=0.288). Relationship between kyphosis measured by using a flexible ruler and inter-scapular pain in male and female students was not significant (p=0.946). However, the relationship between lumbar lordosis and low back pain was statistically significant (p=0.006). Also, no significant relationship was observed between abnormal kyphosis and frequency of inter-scapular pain, and between lumbar lordosis and low back pain. Conclusions: Lumbar lordosis contributes to low back pain. The causes of musculoskeletal pain could be muscle imbalance and muscle and ligament strain.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Spine with a lateral S-shaped curve is an important com-ponent of the body skeleton. This structure supports the body during different activities by maintaining appropriate body alignment and posture <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>.</p><p>Normal alignment of the spine depends on its structural, muscular, bony, and articular performance; therefore, weakness of the spinal muscles can lead to static and dynamic imbalances of the body which are generally called positional abnormalities <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Skeletal abnormalities result from lack of motion and inappropriate movement patterns, which have undesirable effects on the psychological, social, and physiological function <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</p><p>Hyperkyphosis or postural round back is a common spinal deformity with a prevalence of 15.3% in Western societies <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> and 13.2% in Iranian high school students <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Congenital anomalies, neuro-muscular disorders, Scheuermann disease, and positional difficulties play an important role in causing thoracic kyphosis. Increasing the arch of the thoracic spine known as kyphosis along with the shortening of the thoracic muscles and weakness of the respiratory muscles affect the pulmonary system by decreasing the thoracic volume and lung volume <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p><p>Thoracic pain is one of the common conditions found in all of the societies and nowadays its prevalence is increasing following a decrease in mobility, an increase in weight of the trunk, inappropriate positioning of the spine during daily activities, and increasing use of computers <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6]</ref>. Physical activities, extensor exercises, and constant control of kyphosis by orthopedic surgeons are the examples of related treatments <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7]</ref>. If kyphosis is progressive, a brace needs to be applied <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref>. In that case, ongoing assessment of kyphosis is essential to control the thoracic curve and to evaluate the outcomes of the treatment.</p><p>Lumbar lordosis is the ventral curvature of the spine formed by wedging of the lumbar vertebrae and intervertebral discs <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref>. Several studies have indicated the clinical and functional importance of lumbar lordosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref>. Lumbar lordosis is a key component in maintaining the sagittal balance. According to some studies as lordosis increases, thoracic kyphosis also increases; however, some studies have indicated that an increase in lordosis is accompanied by a decrease in kyphosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">12]</ref>. The abnormal lumbar curvature can lead to imbalance in the standing position <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p><p>Medical examinations have shown that lumbar pain rarely has pathophysiological causes <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref>. Pain intensifies at night following muscular weakness and in the morning and decreases after daily activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref>.</p><p>Assessment of kyphosis is usually performed via lateral radiography of the spine imposed on an X-ray <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref>. Continuous radiography is expensive and also potentially life-threatening <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>; hence, researchers have attempted to perform this assessment via non-invasive techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref>.</p><p>The use of a flexible ruler as a means of non-invasive measurement of kyphosis and lordosis is cheap and accessible with a simple application <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>. Therefore, the goal of the present study was to evaluate the kyphosis and lordosis angles by using a flexible ruler and their relationship with pain severity and frequency in male and female students.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials and Methods</head><p>In this observational, cross-sectional, descriptive study, 241 (157 females and 84 males) students of Hamadan University of Medical Sciences were enrolled.</p><p>Sample size was calculated based on the number of newly entered students to the above mentioned university (650 female students, 350 male students) and the population ratio (p) of 68% from previous studies. The present study was ethically approved by the related committee of Hamadan University of medical sciences. All participants took part in the study with full awareness and voluntarily. Students who had experienced rheumatologic or neurological pain and orthopedic diseases such as idiopathic scoliosis and difference in leg length discrepancy were excluded <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. A pain questionnaire was used to examine the severity and frequency of the lumbar and inter-scapular pain. Pain severity was assessed via a visual numerical scale from 0 to 10.</p><p>Pain frequency was measured as follows: never or rarely (perceived pain, once a month or less), sometimes (perceived pain, twice or three times a month), and often (perceived pain, once to three times a week or more) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p><p>A flexible ruler was used to examine the thoracic and lumbar curvature. Validity and reliability studies for the flexible ruler and non-radiographic method have been performed previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref>.</p><p>The amount of lordosis and kyphosis was measured three times by a single examiner using a flexible ruler and the average value was reported. Also, the inter-observer correlation coefficient was 0.87 with a measurement error of 0.006.</p><p>To assess the curvatures by using a flexible ruler, participants were asked to stand in the normal anatomical position with the examiner standing at the back. First lumbar (L 1 ) and second sacral (S 2 ) vertebrae were considered as markers for evaluating the lumbar curvature. In order to identify S 2, the posterior superior iliac spine (PSIS) was marked. The midpoint between the two PSISs, according to Gray's Anatomy, was considered as the spinous process of the S 2 .</p><p>To identify L 1 , the examiner pressed the lower back above the iliac crest in order to move the soft tissue laterally where the two thumbs reach horizontally together on the L 4 spinous process. By counting up the vertebrae, the L 1 spinous process was identified. Then, the flexible ruler was placed on L 1 and S 2 while a hand pressed on it to eliminate the gap between the ruler and the skin. The ruler was put on a sheet and the lumbar curve was drawn afterwards <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>.</p><p>Measurement of the thoracic curvature was performed in a similar manner to that of the lumbar curvature. The only difference was that C7 and the junction of T12 and L1 were marked in order to measure the thoracic curvature <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref>. The thoracic curve was drawn by using a flexible ruler. Two ends of the curve reached together, and a L line was drawn whose midline vertically reached the middle of the curve through the h line. The lengths of h and L lines were calculated and the aforementioned angle was obtained. The line was drawn from the side of the ruler which touched the skin. θ=4 arc tan 2 h/L Using descriptive statistics, mean values of kyphotic and lordotic angles and their prevalence based on gender were reported.</p><p>Because of the misfit of the data to normal hypothesis, non-parametric tests such as the Mann-Whitney U test and non-parametric correlation tests of Gamma and Kendall were applied. Data processing was carried out via SPSS ver. 16 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Mean values of lordotic and kyphotic angles are shown in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. Mean value of the lumbar arch was 34.46°±12.61° and 22.46°±9.9° in female students and male students, respectively.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The goal of this study was to investigate the prevalence of kyphosis and lordosis by using a flexible ruler and also of musculoskeletal pain and their relationship with pain severity and frequency in male and female students of Hamadan University of Medical Sciences.</p><p>According to the results, the mean values of lordosis and kyphosis were 34.46°±12.61° and 22.57°±7.08° in female students and 22.46°±9.9° and 23.56°±6.57° in male students, respectively. Many studies have proved the validity and reliability of using flexicurve in comparison with radiographic data. A systematic review of validity and reliability of the nonradiographic method showed high to very high levels of reliability of the Flexicurve. This study suggested that flexicurve is an easy to use, hand-held tool, and it could replace radiography in evaluating lumbar lordosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref>. However, with respect to cervical lordosis, there are some studies that showed that the flexicurve sagittal skin contour measurement has poor concurrent validity compared to radiographic measurements <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref>. It seems that postural or X-ray positioning and radiographic analysis lead to appearance of confounding variables, which affects the results. Also, obesity, muscular development, previous trauma, and biomechanical complexities of the cervical spine could result in some differences in the measurement of surface contour compared to lateral radiographs <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref>. According to previous research, the flexicurve kyphosis angle provides strong validity and reliability. Furthermore, it is inexpensive and can be easily used by the entry-level research staff, requires short measurement time, and does not expose the patients to high radiation risk. It seems that the use of this measurement method for detection of spine abnormalities and examination of the posture in healthy subjects is quite beneficial <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref>.</p><p>On the other hand, postural age-related changes include a forward head, rounded shoulders, increased thoracic kyphosis, decreased lumbar lordosis, and flexed hips and knees <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref>. With age, a progressive change occurs in the kyphotic angle in both genders <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref>. However, there are limited evidences to illustrate the causes of age-related lumbar lordosis, and further research is required to determine the influence of age on lordosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref>. Therefore, in the present study, as all participants were young (aged between 19 to 21 years), we did not aim to evaluate the effect of age on the amount of kyphosis and lordosis. Lumbar lordosis showed a significant difference between both genders (p&lt;0.001); however, no difference was seen in the thoracic curve (p=0.288). In other words, the mean value of lordosis was higher in female students than in male students. The mean value of kyphosis was higher in male students than in female students, although this difference was not significant.</p><p>Altogether, the lumbar curve was greater in female students compared to male students in this study. Although some studies showed that lumbar lordosis is not different between females and males <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref>, results of the present study support the finding that lumbar curve is greater in females than in males <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref>.</p><p>The prevalence of abnormal kyphosis was 2.4% and 1.2% in male students and female students, respectively. Therefore, abnormal kyphosis was more common in male students compared with female students. Abnormal lordosis was more common in female students than in male students (12.7% in female students and 1.2% in male students).The prevalence of kyphosis and lordosis beyond the normal range in students of Hamadan University of Medical Sciences was 1.66% and 8.71%, respectively.</p><p>There was no significant relationship between kyphosis and inter-scapular pain in male students and female students and the whole study sample; while, they were significantly related in the study by Griegel-Morris et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. This difference in the result was most likely due to the different methods of measurement. In the present study, kyphosis was measured by using a flexible ruler which is more valid and subtle than observational assessment which could consider kyphosis of 20°-40° as an abnormality.</p><p>A significant relationship was observed between lumbar pain and lordosis in the whole study sample, although it was not significant according to gender. Therefore, it could be said that gender had no effect on the relationship between pain and severity of the abnormalities, which was probably due to the homogeneity of male and female students with respect to abnormality and pain. Several factors are involved in causing low back pain such as disc degeneration, muscle stretch, age, and occupation <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref>. Clinical observations indicate the role of postural anomalies in low back pain <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref>. In this study, lordosis in the students was significantly related to low back pain, and this finding corresponded with that in the study by McKenzie <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref> which showed that low back pain occurred as a result of long and inaccurate over-stretching of the soft tissue in an abnormal posture. That is, as the extensor muscles become overloaded during lordosis, low back pain may emerge.</p><p>There was no significant relationship between the abnormality and pain frequency, which corresponded with the results of the study carried out in younger and older adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p><p>Since cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spinal regions are biomechanically related, any change in each arch might be due to the postural alteration in other arches <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref>. In the present study, the relationship between lordosis and kyphosis was not significant. Perhaps, increasing the sample size could help in demonstrating a significant relationship between lordosis and kyphosis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>According to the results, lordosis may play a key role in low back pain, which might result from muscular imbalance and overstretching of the muscles and ligaments. Low back pain may also be caused by psychological factors, which usually cannot be controlled by the researcher in most studies. It could be concluded that through a simple examination of the spine, such abnormalities can be identified as well as chronic spinal pain can be prevented.</p><p>Findings of this study indicate the importance of postural evaluation in youth, in which chronic pain is rarely related to other diseases, and hence, the pain could be considered to occur as a result of inappropriate posture and can be managed by performing corrective exercises.</p><p>Involvement of a team of professionals in occupational therapy, physical therapy, ergonomics, and orthopedic surgery is recommended in order to provide information to individuals about the anatomy and biomechanics of the spine, risk factors that contribute to abnormalities, accurate positions for sitting, standing, lying, carrying objects, and using instruments, and performing exercises to strengthen the weak muscles and correct the abnormal posture, known as back school program for musculoskeletal pain.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0"><head>Table 1 .Table 2 .Table 3 .</head><label>123</label><figDesc>Comparison of the mean of lordotic and kyphotic angles in females and males Prevalence of the kyphosis according to the gender (°) Prevalence of the lordosis according to the gender (°)</figDesc><table><row><cell></cell><cell cols="2">Female (n=157)</cell><cell></cell><cell cols="2">Male (n=84)</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>p-value</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>Mean (SD)</cell><cell>Min</cell><cell>Max</cell><cell>Mean (SD)</cell><cell>Min</cell><cell>Max</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Measurement of lumbar curve (°)</cell><cell>34.46 (12.61)</cell><cell>5.73</cell><cell>73.74</cell><cell>22.46 (9.9)</cell><cell>5.91</cell><cell>50.12</cell><cell>&lt;0.001</cell></row><row><cell>Measurement of thoracic curve (°)</cell><cell>22.57 (7.08)</cell><cell>5.73</cell><cell>53.44</cell><cell>23.56 (6.57)</cell><cell>9.16</cell><cell>42.16</cell><cell>0.288</cell></row><row><cell cols="2">SD, standard deviation; Min, minimum; Max, maximum.</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell cols="2">Frequency (%)</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>Degree</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>Female</cell><cell>Male</cell><cell></cell><cell>Total</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>&lt;20</cell><cell>58 (36.9)</cell><cell cols="2">25 (29.8)</cell><cell>83 (34.43)</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>&gt;20 &amp; &lt;40</cell><cell>97 (61.8)</cell><cell cols="2">57 (67.9)</cell><cell>154 (63.9)</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>&gt;40</cell><cell>2 (1.3)</cell><cell>2 (2.4)</cell><cell></cell><cell>4 (1.66)</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell cols="2">Frequency (%)</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>Degree</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>Female</cell><cell>Male</cell><cell></cell><cell>Total</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>&lt;30</cell><cell>59 (37.6)</cell><cell cols="2">60 (71.4)</cell><cell>119 (49.83)</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>&gt;30 &amp; &lt;50</cell><cell>78 (49.7)</cell><cell cols="2">23 (27.4)</cell><cell>101 (41.9)</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>&gt;50</cell><cell>20 (12.7)</cell><cell>1 (1.2)</cell><cell></cell><cell>21 (8.71)</cell></row></table><note></note></figure>
