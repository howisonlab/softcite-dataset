				<p>Background: We explored correlations between the new International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer/American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society classification, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation status, and prognosis. Methods: Data from 293 patients with lung adenocarcinoma were classified according to the new classification. Fisher&apos;s exact, χ 2 , and log-rank tests and Cox regression analysis were used to analyze correlations between EGFR mutation status, lung cancer prognosis, and the new histologic subtype. Disease-free survival and progressionfree survival (PFS) were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Results: Lepidic and non-solid adenocarcinomas showed significantly elevated EGFR mutation rates (79.0% and 65.8%, respectively; P &lt; 0.05). EGFR mutation status was only associated with gender (P &lt; 0.001). EGFR mutation-positive patients who received targeted therapy had better median PFS than those who received chemotherapy as first-line treatment (P &lt; 0.001). The median PFS of patients with exon 19 and exon 21 mutations who received first-line targeted therapy were 12.5 and 9.5 months, respectively (P = 0.970). Patients with micropapillary predominant adenocarcinomas had the shortest disease-free survival (&lt;18 months) and PFS. Histologic subtype (P = 0.036), treatment type (P = 0.031), and EGFR mutation status (P = 0.019) might be good prognostic factors for lung adenocarcinoma. Conclusion: Patients with exon 19 mutations obtained greater benefits from targeted therapy. In the new classification, EGFR mutation rates are higher in lepidic cases and in cases without the solid subtype. The micropapillary subtype of adenocarcinoma has the worst prognosis, while the lepidic subtype has the best.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Lung cancer is currently one of the major causes of cancerrelated death worldwide. It is the leading cause of cancerrelated death in China, and often results in greater rates of morbidity and mortality than heart disease and cerebrovascular disorders. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> Pulmonary adenocarcinoma is the most common histological subtype of lung cancer. Its incidence has increased over the past decades, and it occurs in about 50% of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs). <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> In 2011, in light of improvements in our understanding of pulmonary adenocarcinoma, a joint working group of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC), the American Thoracic Society (ATS), and the European Respiratory Society (ERS) proposed a new histologic classification of lung adenocarcinoma. This classification method has been referred to as "the new IASLC/ATS/ERS lung adenocarcinoma classification" or "the new classification." <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> Using the new classification, it is possible to screen for early-stage NSCLC in patients at high risk. Furthermore, the new classification can favorably guide postoperative adjuvant treatment, although there are some limitations for advanced lung cancer. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> Epidermal growth factor receptortyrosine-kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) have significant survival benefits for advanced lung cancer. In NSCLC, EGFR mutations chiefly occur in adenocarcinomas, followed by adenosquamous cell, large-cell undifferentiated, and miscellaneous carcinomas, and are least common in squamous cell carcinomas (&lt;5%). <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> In clinical trials of patients with advanced pulmonary adenocarcinoma and EGFR mutations, chemotherapy was inferior to EGFR-TKIs, which prolonged median survival to 3.5 years. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> Therefore, pretreatment genetic testing is recommended by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) and the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) for cases of advanced lung cancer. In 2014 in China, however, the proportion of patients who received a genetic test was only 27% (although a higher testing rate of 51% was observed in the larger cities, Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou). <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> These relatively low proportions may be explained by the use of mainly exploratory techniques that are yet to be widely adopted, as well as by the presence of notable limitations to specimens. Several studies have attempted to explore the predictive value of the new classification in cases with EGFR mutation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> At present, we are unable to determine the larger clinical implications because some outcomes associated with the EGFR mutation rate are higher in micropapillary predominant adenocarcinomas than in invasive mucinous and solid predominant adenocarcinomas, both in China and internationally.</p><p>We reviewed data from patients diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma at Peking University Third Hospital between 1 November 2011 and 31 December 2014. Additionally, we analyzed the relationships between the new classification and outcomes during follow-up in order to clarify the implications of the new classification and EGFR mutation status for prognosis and therapeutic choices.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Patients</head><p>We analyzed medical records from a population of patients who were diagnosed with and treated for pulmonary adenocarcinoma between 2011 and 2014. The inclusion criteria were: (i) primary lung adenocarcinoma histopathologically confirmed after treatment in the hospital, (ii) stage I-II or stage III for clear resection types and stage IV for non-resected lesions, (iii) lung adenocarcinoma with determined subtypes, and (iv) Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) ≤2. The exclusion criteria were: (i) unclear classification, (ii) metastatic lung adenocarcinoma, and (iii) EGOG PS ≥2. The cases were selected on the basis of availability of archival slides and tissues. The patients' characteristics are summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>, including information on age, gender, clinical stage, EGFR mutation status, and treatment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p>The new classification includes adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS), minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA), invasive carcinoma (lepidic, acinar, papillary, solid, and micropapillary predominant), and variants of invasive adenocarcinomas (invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma [IMA], colloid, fetal, and enteric). <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> A large number of pathologists decided the different subtypes of the new classification by morphology. In the new classification, evidence of a subtype present in &gt;5% of the specimen confirms a diagnosis of that subtype, a subtype present in &gt;40% of the specimen was defined as predominant, and other subtypes were considered mixed. We used the American Joint Committee on Cancer tumor node metastasis (TNM) classification criteria. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> The resected tumor specimens were subjected to EGFR mutational analysis using DNA sequencing, as well as fluorescence PCR analyses of biopsy specimens. The results were regarded as reliable because biopsy specimens show only pathologic analysis and not variety. DNA sequencing was conducted as follows. DNA extraction: The specimens were cut serially into coronal and sagittal slices of 4 μm thickness using a microtome. The tumor cells were enriched to determine which cells contained ≥70% evidence of cancer. DNA from paraffinized tissues samples was isolated using a QIAamp DNA FFPE Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Nucleic acid protein concentrations were measured along with DNA purity and concentration using a Nanodrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). DNA concentration was adjusted to 20-30 ng/μL and stored at −20 C.</p><p>Epidermal growth factor receptor amplification and purification: EGFR gene PCR amplification and sequencing primers were tested and synthesized by Yingjun Life Technologies Co. Ltd. to directly target EGFR tyrosine coding region exon ranges from 18 to 21 in order to synthesize primers. The exon 18 upstream primer was 5 0 -AGCATGGTGAGGGCTGAGGTGAC-3 0 (23 bp) and the downstream primer was 5 0 -ATATACAGCTTGCAAG-GACTCTGG-3 0 (24 bp). The exon 19 upstream primer was 5 0 -CCAGATCACTGBGCAGCATGTGGCACC-3 0 (27 bp) and the downstream primer was 5 0 -AGCAGGGTCTAGAGCAGAGCAGCTGCC-3 0 (27 bp). The exon 20 upstream primer was 5 0 -GATCGCATT-CATGCGTCTYCACC-3 0 (23 bp), and the downstream primer was 5 0 -TrGcTATCCCAGGAGCGCAGACC-3 0 (23 bp). The exon 21 upstream primer was 5 0 -TCA-GAGCCTGGCATGAACATGACCCTG-3 0 (27 bp) and the downstream primer was 5 0 -GGTCCCTGGTGTCAG-GAAAATGCTGG-3 0 (26 bp). PCR products 262, 265, 362, and 297 bp were maintained with PCR amplification according to the clarification. Five microlitres of the PCR amplification product was run on 1% agarose gel to observe PCR production and was documented by absorption analysis.</p><p>Reaction, purification, and sequencing: 0.5 μL purified PCR products, 1 μL reagents of sequencing, 2 μL sequence primers, and 2.5-Ul ddH 2 O were maintained with sequencing. To purify the samples after the sequencing reaction was completed, 1 μL NaAc and 15 μL alcohol were added to each sample. Ten microlitres of Hi-Di was subsequently added to the samples to filter DNA alcohol volatilization. The samples were then degenerated by the PCR instrument, spotted in 96-well plates, and analyzed with ABI-3500 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), using chroma or alignment for analysis.</p><p>Fluorescence PCR: Procedures were performed using an EGFR mutation kit (Qiagen) comprised of 8-PCR tube reaction strips (reagents include E18, E19, E20, and E21 mutation sites), Taq enzymes, and EGFR-positive control material, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Analysis was performed for each sample, positive control material, and a negative control (purified water) during each PCR reaction. The samples were harvested from positive control material and Taq enzyme (EGFR) and centrifuged rapidly for 15 minutes. Subsequently, 2.7 μL Taq enzyme (EGFR) was added to the 42.3 μL tested DNA samples, the 42.3 μL positive control material samples, and 42.3 μL purified water samples to admix in 15 seconds on amalgamation. The samples were then centrifuged rapidly for 15 seconds. The manufacturer recommended adding 1.5-3 ng/μL DNA samples from paraffin sections (i.e. each reaction tube included additional DNA of 7.05-14.1 ng), which is different to adding DNA according to the sample duration of paraffin sections. It is recommended to be Analyis was performed directly after DNA extraction of blood plasma and serum, as per the manufacturer's recommendation. TE buffer (pH8.0) is recommended to dilute the DNA sample. Each 5 μL mixed DNA sample along the PCR tubal wall was added to an 8-PCR tube reaction strip. Lids were then placed and the samples were centrifuged before being added to 8-PCR tube reaction strips. Reactions were subject to placement of the 8-PCR tube reaction strips into PCR instruments, according to standard procedure.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cohort characteristics</head><p>We analyzed the medical records of patients who had been diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma at Peking University Third Hospital between 1 November 2011 and 31 December 2014. Of the 377 selected adenocarcinoma cases, 84 cases with unclear subtypes were excluded. In total, 293 patients were included in the study: 176 women and 117 men. The age range at diagnosis was 29-84 years (mean 62). Specimens were available from surgically resected adenocarcinomas (wedge or segmental resections) in 132 patients, needle or incisional biopsy in 112 patients, and pleural cytology in 49 patients. Patient details are summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> and <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>.</p></div>

The details of the patient cohort are summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>. There were three cases of AIS, three cases of MIA, and 287 cases of invasive adenocarcinoma; 126 were acinar predominant (43.9%), 66 were lepidic predominant (23.0%), 31 were papillary predominant (10.8%), 35 were solid predominant (12.2%), and 10 were micropapillary predominant (3.5%). Following the World Health Organization (WHO) lung adenocarcinoma classification, mixed subtypes (61.1%) and non-mixed subtypes (62.4%) were found in 173 and 120 patients, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation status</head><p>A total of 293 lung adenocarcinoma patients were included in this study. EGFR gene status was tested in 211 cases. EGFR mutation was found in 130 cases (130/211, 61.6%), while 81 cases showed wild-type EGFR (81/211, 38.4%). Among the cases of EGFR mutation, 54 cases were deletion mutations in exon 19 (41.3%) and 50 were L858R missense mutations in exon 21 (38.5%). EGFR mutation status was related to gender (P &lt; 0.001), but was unrelated to tumor stage, age, or histologic subtype.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Lepidic and non-solid adenocarcinoma and EGFR status</head><p>Epidermal growth factor receptor mutation genetic testing was not performed on the six patients with AIS or MIA as the sample size was inadequate. Correlation between the new classification and EGFR status was complicated. Patient details are summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 5</ref>. Lepidic adenocarcinomas and non-solid adenocarcinomas showed significantly elevated EGFR mutation rates (79.0% and 65.8%, respectively; P &lt; 0.05). The EGFR-mutation positive patients who received targeted therapy had better median PFS rates than those who received chemotherapy as first-line treatment (P &lt; 0.001). Lepidic containing and predominant were the most common and statistically significant (51.5%, P = 0.004 and 51.4%, P = 0.008, respectively). EGFR mutation rates were relatively unusual in acinar and papillary predominant and containing cases compared with lepidic adenocarcinoma, and no statistically significant differences were observed (50.0%, 51.4%, 45.2%, 53.2%; P = 0.694, 0.215, 0.726, 0.213, respectively). The mutation rate was lowest in solid containing cases (21.9%), and was statistically significant (P &lt; 0.001). Following the WHO lung adenocarcinoma classification, mixed subtypes and non-mixed subtypes did not show significantly different EGFR mutation rates (61.1% and 62.4%, respectively).</p><p>Fifty The median PFS in stage III-IV patients with exon 19 mutations was longer than in patients with exon 21 mutations when treated with targeted first-line therapy. These 79 patients with mutations were compared with 51 patients who received chemotherapy. The median PFS  was 13 months in the patients who received targeted therapy and 7.5 months in those who received chemotherapy (P &lt; 0.001). The results indicated that median PFS was significantly prolonged in patients with EGFR mutations who had been selected for targeted therapy. The details are summarized in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. Among the cases of EGFR mutation in metastatic tumors, 35 cases were deletion mutations in exon 19 and 32 cases were L858R missense mutations in exon 21. The median PFS rates of patients with exon 19 and exon 21 mutations who received first-line EGFR-targeted therapy were 12.5 and 9.5 months, respectively (P = 0.970).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>As has been discussed previously by many researchers, the 2004 WHO diagnostic criteria and disease classification improved lung adenocarcinoma classification as it considered heterogeneous clinical, pathological, radiologic, and molecular criteria for this disease. Histologic subtypes and molecular typing had gradually become more important following the discovery of the target EGFR in 2004. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> In response to our improved understanding of the histopathology of lung adenocarcinoma, in 2011, a joint working group of IASLC/ATS/ERS proposed a new histologic classification of this cancer. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> This classification includes AIS, MIA, and invasive adenocarcinoma, but discards mixed adenocarcinoma. It further includes acinar, lepidic, papillary, solid, and micropapillary predominant disease. In the new classification, a subtype with &gt;5% presence is considered contained, a subtype with &gt;40% presence is defined as predominant, and other percentages are defined as mixed. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> Studies from Europe and the United States reported a ratio of &lt;20% prevalence of lepidic predominant and papillary predominant cases, 10-40% prevalence of acinar predominant cases, 20-40% prevalence of solid predominant cases, <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> The relationship between epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation and the choice of first-line treatment in patients with stage III-IV adenocarcinomas.

No EGFR testing was performed for the AIS and MIA cases because of the small number of relevant patients in the study. Other conclusions are similar to relevant trials. There was a statistically significant relationship between EGFR mutation and solid adenocarcinomas (P &lt; 0.001).</p><p>In the IPASS study, the response and PFS rates in NSCLC with EGFR mutation were longer in the gefitinib than in the chemotherapy group (71.2% vs. 47.3%, P &lt; 0.001; 9.5 m vs. 6.3 m, P &lt; 0.001). <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> The median PFS rate was 3.5 years for patients with EGFR mutation who received treatment with EGFR-TKIs. The NCCN, ESMO, and ASCO recommend performing EGFR gene testing before the initiation of treatment; however, some patients received chemotherapy after receiving a diagnosis and gene testing results, after receiving unclear results, or because they refused to wait for results. In our study, the median PFS rate in patients with stage III-IV disease and EGFR mutations who received targeted therapy was significantly longer than that for patients who received chemotherapy. Furthermore, the difference in PFS was statistically significant (P &lt; 0.001), similar to the results of previous studies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> Thus, EGFR status is important for therapy selection. In 2015, ASCO noted that the median PFS in patients who received targeted therapy was longer in patients with exon 19 mutations than in patients with exon 21 mutations. In addition, patients with exon 19 mutations who received targeted therapy had longer PFS than patients with exon 21 mutations who received chemotherapy; however, the difference was not statistically significant in our study. This finding may prompt research into whether patients with exon 19 mutations can benefit from targeted therapy. No statistically significant results were observed for bone or cerebral metastases in the present study, as a result of the small sample sizes of EGFR mutation and wild-type EGFR cases; however, cerebral metastases are more common in patients with EGFR mutations. Sample sizes need to be increased in future research.

The follow-up period was one to two years, and the patients showed no evidence of metastasis or relapse. In previous studies of stage I-II invasive adenocarcinoma in Asia, the five-year DFS rates were 70-95%, 60-80%, 0-50%, 55-70%, and 40-60% for lepidic, acinar, micropapillary, papillary, and solid cases, respectively. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> These findings may have been a consequence of the high rates of EGFR mutations in lepidic cases. Furthermore, in patients with stage I-IV invasive adenocarcinomas, overall survival rates were 70, 60, 50, 55, and 45 months for lepidic, acinar, solid, papillary, and micropapillary predominant cases, respectively. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> In our study, the oneyear PFS rates were 11.3%, 70.7%, 49.2%, and 51.0% for micropapillary, lepidic, acinar, and papillary predominant cases. The difference between our rates and the findings of previous studies might be explained by the absence of sufficient preoperative staging, personalized therapy for surgical approaches, drugs, and duration of therapy.</p><p>The high EGFR mutation rates of lepidic and solid predominant cases in our study are informative for therapy selection. The findings generally support the idea that patients with exon 19 mutations can achieve greater benefits from targeted therapy; however, more clinical trials are needed on this topic. Micropapillary predominant cases had the shortest DFS and PFS and the highest degree of malignancy. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 3</head><label>3</label><figDesc>Correlations between treatment type and exon 19 and 21 mutations in patients with stage III-IV adenocarcinoma.
