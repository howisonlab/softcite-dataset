			<abstract>
				<p>Stress and coping in the families caring for their member with mental retardation has recently received worldwide research attention. There is no comprehensive instrument to study these issues in India. This study reports on development and standardization of a new instrument to fill this lacuna. Family Interview for Stress and Coping in Mental Retardation (FISC-MR), a semi-structured interview schedule, was developed as a part of two years prospective study of efficacy of brief family intervention for 157 children with mental retardation (funded by ICMR). The tool consists of 2 sections-one measuring stress (daily care, emotional, social and financial) and the other measuring mediators of stress or coping strategies (awareness, attitudes, expectations, rearing practices and social support). Results indicate moderate to high reliability (internal consistency, inter-rater reliability and test-retest reliability) and validity (factorial, criterion and construct) of the instrument. It is concluded that FISC-MR is a useful, reliable and valid instrument for both clinical and research purposes.</p>

The nature The consequences of this home cased care of stress has bean shown to span over several approach for the family has received a good deal aspects of family life such as daily care demands, of research attention from the professionals in the emotional distress (such as maternal depression), last two decades. One major concern of the interpersonal difficulties (such as parental researchers has been to study the processes of discord), financial problems and adverse social consequences (such as social isolation).</p><p>What are the variables which influence or determine the extent of stress experienced by the families? Studies indicate 3 sets of variables. These are (i) child specific variables such as age, sex and severity of retardation, (ii) socio-demographic variables such as social class, family income and domicile and (iii) family coping resources and strategies. It is interesting to note that studies have consistently shown that coping by the families has a more decisive effect on the stress experienced by them than the other 2 sets of variables <ref type="bibr">(Byrne &amp; Cunningham, 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr">Beresford,1994)</ref>. Though it is clear that coping plays a key role in family adaptation, it has been a difficult research question to study. Several theoretical models have been utilised for examining this intricate process of family stress, coping and adaptation, such as the stress and coping theory of <ref type="bibr">Folkman &amp; Lazarus (1984)</ref>, the ABCX model of <ref type="bibr">McCubbin (Orr et al.,1991)</ref> and eco-cultural model <ref type="bibr">(Gallimore et al.,1993)</ref>.</p><p>What are the coping strategies employed by the families to deal with the stress? Researchers have been able to identify many such coping strategies. For instance, in their review, <ref type="bibr">Gallagher and colleagues (1983)</ref> identified the following as important mediator variables (or coping strategies) which influence the stress felt by the families: expectations, attributions, parents' view of the causation of the handicap, nature and quality of daily interactions with the child, parents' notions about their own efficacy as 'change agents' in facilitating child's development, attitudes and social support. Other such mediating factors which have been identified include family beliefs and perceptions, religious and moral beliefs, overall philosophies and ideologies held by the families, family lifestyles and extent of harmony in the family <ref type="bibr">(Byrne &amp; Cunningham,1985;</ref><ref type="bibr">Beresford,1994)</ref>. The role of these issues in the family focussed intervention in mental retardation is evidently of crucial importance and has been reviewed elsewhere <ref type="bibr">(Cunningham, 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr">Davis &amp; Rushton, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr">Girimaji,1993;</ref><ref type="bibr">Beresford,1994)</ref>.</p><p>A variety of approaches have beon adapted by the researchers to study stress and coping in the families and include questionnaires <ref type="bibr">(Fiedrich et al.,1983;</ref><ref type="bibr">Knussen &amp; Cunningham, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr">Dyson et al.,1993</ref><ref type="bibr">), interviews (Frey et al.,1989</ref><ref type="bibr">Narayan et al.,1993)</ref>, rating scales <ref type="bibr">(Bhatti et al., 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr">Peterson,1984)</ref> and ethnographic methods <ref type="bibr">(Gallimore et al.,1993)</ref>. The focus of these methods has varied and included areas such as mothers' well-being, marital adjustment among parents, stress of parenting, parental attitudes, care-taking demands, perceptions and expectations. However, there is no one standardized instrument to study the variety of stresses experienced by the families and coping strategies available to them. Such an instrument is required not only for research purposes but also to facilitate family focussed intervention. Keeping this lacuna in mind, the authors developed a new instrument to evaluate stress and its mediators in the families of children with mental retardation. This work was carried out as a part of the initial preparation for two years prospective study funded by Indian Council of Medical Research, titled "a study of the evaluation of the effectiveness of brief inpatient family intervention versus outpatient intervention for mentally retarded children'. For this study, stress was defined as those aspects of the family's response to its member with mental retardation that are experienced as distressful. Mediators of stress, or coping strategies were defined as those aspects of family's beliefs, attributions, expectations, resources and practices that are likely to influence the stress experienced by the family. These definitions were adapted along the lines suggested by <ref type="bibr">Galfagheret al.(1983)</ref>.</p><p>This paper describes the development and standardization of this instrument, which has been named Family Interview for Stress and Coping in Mental Retardation (FISC -MR).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MATERIAL AND METHOD</head><p>Description of the main study: In the project funded by Indian Council of Medical Research and carried out at the child and adolescent psychiatry unit of the Department of Psychiatry of NIMHANS, two comprehensive models of brief, intensive, family-focused intervention in mental retardation were developed, crystallized and prospectively evaluated. One was the outpatient group and the other was the inpatient group. The components of intervention included (i) family orientation, (ii) medical measures, (iii) general parenting measures, and (iv) parent training. In all, 75 and 82 subjects were recruited for inpatient and outpatient group respectively.</p><p>Many instruments were used to collect data at intake and follow-up. These included Detailed Evaluation Schedule (DES), vlneland Social Maturity Scale (VSMS -Matin's Indian Adaptation), Gessel's Developmental Schedule (GDS), Problem Behaviour Rating Scale (PBRS), Questionnaire on Resources and Stress <ref type="bibr">(QRS-SF;</ref><ref type="bibr">Friedrich et al.,1983)</ref>, FISC-MR, Intervention Sheet (IS) and Follow-up Sheet. The efficacy of intervention was studied in terms of (a) impact on child variables (adaptive functioning and problem behaviours) and (b) impact on families (observer rated and self report of family stress and coping strategies).</p><p>The subjects and their families were prospectively followed up every three months for a period of two years. Instruments measuring outcome were repeatedly administered at the time of follow-up visits.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Development and description of the FISC-MR:</head><p>An in-depth survey of the all the available instruments were made. Authors also drew heavily from their clinical experience in the field. Following this, sections, areas and sub-scales were decided upon and questions were prepared to cover the sub-scales. This instrument has been developed not only for recording the perceived stress and its mediators (or coping strategies) in the family, but also to help in the formulation of family based intervention.</p><p>The final prepared version of the instrument is an observer rated, semi-structured interview schedule and attempts to systematically elicit and quantify (i) the stress experienced (perceived) by families caring for a child with mental retardation and (ii) certain key coping strategies specific to disability employed by the families that are likely to modify the perceived stress (mediators). Accordingly, FISC-MR has 2 major Sections : Section-I is meant for elicitation of perceived stress in different area and Section-ll for exploration of certain mediating factors or coping strategies. The structure of these two Section is laid out in table 1. In short, Section-I has 4 areas and a total of 11 sub-scales, whereas Section-ll has 5 areas and a total of 9 sub-scales. A four or five point rating scale with scoring instructions are provided for each sub-scale. The sub-scales on stress are rated on a 5 point scale (no or minimal stress to very high level) and those in the Section-ll are rated on a 4 point scale (most favourable to most unfavourable). <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2 and  3</ref> give details of the scoring patterns for Section I and II respectively. The approximate time required for the administration of the instrument was around 45 minutes.</p></div>

Training also consisted of practical demonstration, pilot administration and feedback. They were asked to rate the families for the study purpose following a satisfactory period of training. The families recruited for the study initially underwent a detailed evaluation by the research staff, who familiarized themselves with the nature of child's problems and the background of the families. Following a discussion with one of the authors, they went on to administer FISC-MR to the key family members (both parents in 93% of instances). They were blind to previous rating while administering the instrument during follow-ups.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample for standardization :</head><p>As noted, the sample consisted of families of 157 subjects with mental retardation attending the mental retardation clinic of NIMHANS who fulfilled the criteria for inclusion into the main study. Subjects were of a young age (around 50% under 3 years of age), from a lower socioeconomic background, both rural and urban and with moderate to profound degree of mental retardation (mean SQ was 24.9 in IP group and 37.3 in OP group) <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">(Table 4)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULT</head><p>The results of standardization of the instrument are reported below in terms of reliability and validity. The analyses were done using SPSS ver. 6.0. Reliability Measures : Three measures of reliability were calculated, as follows: Cronbach's Alpha, a measure of internal consistency, calculated for the whole sample (N=155, data for 2 cases missing) separately for Section-I and Section-ll, was 0.9 and 0.67 respectively. Interrater reliability of 3 raters for 9 families was computed. The intra-class correlation co-efficient (ICC) for any single rater was 0.81 and average reliability for all 3 raters was 0.93, indicating good inter-rater reliability. Test-retest reliability was calculated for a sub-sample of families who were evaluated at intake and again after a mean duration of 4.5 months (N=110). Pearson's Yfor Section-I was 0.71 (p&lt;.01) and for Section-ll was 0.36 (p&lt;.01), indicating moderate to high testretest reliability.</p><p>Measures of Validity: A factorial validation was attempted to find out whether the scale yields a small number of meaningful factors. A principal components analysis with varimax rotation followed by factor extraction with eigen values more than 1 was carried out separately for Section-I and Section-ll. All the sub-scales (11 for Section-I and 9 for Section-ll) were included for factor analysis. Section-I yielded two factors. On inspection of the loading, factor 1 has been labelled as socio-emotional stress and factor 2 as stress of daily care demand. Similarly, Se'ction-ll yielded 3 factors and have been named as awareness/expectations, attitudes/ rearing practices and social support respectively. The loading of sub-scales on these factors have been given in table 5. Criterion Validity : Since FISC MR is a newly developed instrument, it was decided to concurrently evaluate all the families with another well established instrument. For this purpose, Questionnaire on Resources and Stress -Short Form (QRS-SF) developed by Friedrich and his colleagues <ref type="bibr">(Friedrich et al.,1983</ref>) and widely used in USA was chosen. This is a self-report Questionnaire of family stress completed by a key family member and has 52 items. The criterion or concurrent validity, as measured as Pearson's Y between Section-I and QRS-SF score for 157 families at intake was 0.63 (p&lt;.01), indicating moderate criterion or concurrent validity. Construct Validity : It was hypothesized that measure of stress (total score on Section-I) should correlate with measure of mediators (total score on Section-ll), which was indeed so, Pearson's Y between-Section-I total score and Section-ll total score was found to be 0.51, (p&lt;.001), indicating a moderate degree of evidence for construct validity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>From the results, it is evident that the new instrument reasonably satisfies the requirements of standardisation in terms of reliability and validity. The coefficients of measures of reliability were between 0.36 to 0.9. Some loss of association may have occurred in test-retest reliability due to the possibility of intervention acting as a confounding variable. The coefficients of validity measures were between 0.51 and 0.63, indicating a reasonable degree of validity. In the factorial study, though there was some overlap of items between the factors, the overall factor loading of items revealed meaningful factors. The emergence of two factors in the Section-I viz., emotional/social and stress of care demand, is in keeping with the findings reported by others <ref type="bibr">(Crnic et al.,1983;</ref><ref type="bibr">Friedrich et al.,1983)</ref>. Section 2 yielded 3 factors as already mentioned, with sub-scales of awareness and expectations hanging together in the first factor, those of attitudes and rearing practices coming together in the second and social support and global adaptation in the third. These findings shed some light on the process of coping and adaptation in these families. It is also worthwhile to note that total score on Section-ll (signifying the extent of coping in the families), correlated significantly with total score on Section-I (signifying the extent of stress in the families), indicating the importance of coping as a determinant of perceived stress in the families. Further refinement of the instrument based on the results of the factor analysis was not attempted in this study. However, it is worth noting that all the sub-scales loaded significantly on one or other factor, indicating that none of the sub-scales were redundant.</p><p>During the use of this instrument in the project work, we found it to be of definite value in terms of getting a better understanding of the families, to develop good rapport with them to facilitate further work and in planning targeted intervention, be it in the form of improving their coping skills, relieving their personal distress, enhancing their rearing and training practices, or improving their social life. So, the instrument, to our mind, can not only serve for research purposes but also for planning management. The instrument has already been used, either in the original or modified form in 3 postgraduate dissertations and experience thereof lends additional support to usefulness of the instrument <ref type="bibr">(Gaekwad,1993;</ref><ref type="bibr">Anand,1996;</ref><ref type="bibr">Rathnasabapathy, 1996)</ref>. The training requirements for using this instrument would include (i) experience of having worked with several families of children with mental retardation, (ii) a reasonable understanding of the structure and rationale of the instrument, and (iii) few pilot administrations under an experienced supervisor.</p><p>One limitation of this instrument is that it has been developed primarily for families of children with severe forms of mental retardation and therefore best suited for use in this group. However, the utility with families of older subjects with milder forms of mental retardation is yet to be tested and perhaps some modifications might be needed for this purpose, as the worries and concerns of parents and care-givers in this population could be different, for instance issues concerning family life cycle, sexuality, marriage, guardianship and vocational habitation. Another limitation of the instrument is that it takes approximately 45 minutes to administer, further refinements may be warranted to prepare a shorter version for wider clinical use.</p><p>The recent socio-cultural changes in India appear to have had an adverse influence of increasing the stress faced by the families in caring for individuals with mental retardation, and hence calls for greater professional involvement and support. The availability of this instrument hopefully will be a small step in furthering the services and research in this area.</p></div>
