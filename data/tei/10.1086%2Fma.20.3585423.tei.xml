<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Eight years ago, two Macroeconomics Annual papers- <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Goodfriend and King (1997)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">Rotemberg and Woodford (1997)</ref>-played a central role in stimulating a burgeoning research program regarding the monetary policy implications of macroeconomic models with explicit microeconomic foundations.1 This research program incorporates two crucial elements compared with more traditional monetary policy analysis. First, reflecting the influence of the <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Lucas (1976)</ref> critique, the emphasis on explicit microeconomic foundations is intended to ensure that the resulting structural equations are reasonably invariant to the choice of monetary policy. Second, this research follows the standard public finance approach of determining the policy regime that maximizes household welfare and then evaluating the performance of alternative policies relative to this benchmark.</p><p>After initially focusing on small stylized models, this line of research has subsequently proceeded to analyze micro-founded macroeconometric models that incorporate an expanded set of nominal and real rigidities and hence can be matched more closely to observed aggregate data. For example,  (henceforth CEE) specified a dynamic general equilibrium model with a number of distinct structural features: staggered wage and price setting with partial indexation, habit persistence in consumption, endogenous capital accumulation with higher-order adjustment costs, and variable capacity utilization. <ref type="bibr">2 Smets and Wouters (2003a)</ref> (henceforth SW) later applied full-information Bayesian methods to estimate essentially the same specification (augmented by a larger set of structural disturbances) and found that the model is competitive with an unrestricted Bayesian vector autoregression (VAR) in terms of goodness-of-fit and out-of-sample forecasting performance. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> In this paper, we investigate the design of monetary policy when the central bank faces uncertainty regarding the true structure of the economy. Of course, a long-established literature has considered this topic using traditional structural macroeconomic models, building on the seminal work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Brainard (1967)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> Nevertheless, recent analysis of small stylized micro-founded models has demonstrated that the implications of uncertainty can be markedly different when the policymaker's goal is to maximize household welfare because the welfare function itself depends on the specification and parameter values of the model. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">5</ref> By using a micro-founded macroeconometric modeling framework, we can examine the policy implications of several aspects of uncertainty that may be more difficult to consider in a small stylized model. First, by applying Bayesian methods, we can use the posterior distribution of the model parameters to determine whether simple rules that perform well in the baseline economy are robust to parameter uncertainty, that is, to the range of parameter values that are reasonably consistent with the observed data. Second, we can gauge the degree of innovation uncertainty by evaluating the extent to which the policy conclusions are sensitive to alternative assumptions regarding the nature and incidence of the structural shocks to the model. Finally, we can explore the implications of specification uncertainty by changing specific features of the model such as the role of money balances or the structure of nominal contracts. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">6</ref> As the baseline specification for our analysis, we use a microfounded macroeconometric model similar to those studied by CEE and SW. Applying a Bayesian procedure to estimate this model with postwar U.S. data, we set the baseline values of the model parameters using the mean of the posterior distribution. We employ Lagrangian methods to determine the optimal policy under commitment in the baseline economy. Finally, we use second-order perturbation to solve the model and compute the level of welfare under the optimal policy as well as for alternative simple rules. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">7</ref> We find that a simple interest rate rule that responds solely to nominal wage inflation and the lagged interest rate yields a welfare out-come that nearly matches that under the fully optimal policy.8 Because this rule involves only observable variables and does not require a measure of the output gap, the natural rate of interest, or forecasts of variables, the rule can be implemented without assuming that the policymaker knows the correct specification of the model or the true values of the model parameters.</p><p>The near-optimality of the simple wage stabilization rule is directly attributable to the overriding importance of nominal wage inertia in determining the welfare costs of aggregate fluctuations in the baseline economy. This inertia reflects the relatively long duration of nominal wage contracts as well as the nearly uniform degree of indexation to lagged inflation. Furthermore, under our baseline specification of Calvo-style contracts with an exogenous probability of reoptimization, many wage contracts remain in effect much longer than the one-year average duration. Thus, as emphasized by <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Erceg, Henderson, and Levin (2000)</ref>, stabilizing aggregate wage inflation helps alleviate the degree of cross-sectional dispersion in real wages and thereby minimizes the associated inefficiencies in employment of differentiated labor services and in the allocation of leisure across households.</p><p>The simple wage stabilization rule is robust to parameter uncertainty and innovation uncertainty and to some modifications of the baseline model specification. For example, this rule yields near-optimal performance for variations of model parameters based on the estimated posterior distribution, a finding consistent with earlier work regarding the importance of parameter uncertainty.9 However, this rule is not robust across the full range of estimates of model parameters seen in the literature, which often lie in the extreme tails of our estimated posterior distribution. Thus, research that reduces this type of uncertainty regarding certain key parameter values could be used to design monetary policy that yields a significant increase in welfare. The performance of the wage stabilization rule is also relatively insensitive to various assumptions regarding the nature and incidence of the innovations and to augmenting the model to incorporate monetary frictions.</p><p>Nevertheless, this rule is not robust to alternative specifications of the wage-contracting mechanism. In particular, the welfare costs of nominal wage variability are much smaller when wages are determined by Taylor-style contracts with the same average duration as in our baseline specification of Calvo-style contracts.io Thus, the simple wage stabilization rule is no longer nearly optimal, and better welfare outcomes are provided by other simple rules that respond to price inflation and real economic variables. Of course, as <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Hall (2005)</ref> emphasizes, neither Calvo-style nor Taylor-style contracts provide the ideal microeconomic foundations for the determination of nominal wages and employment. Thus, our results should be interpreted as highlighting the extent to which additional research regarding the structure of labor markets is likely to have substantial benefits for the design of monetary stabilization policy.</p><p>The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of the baseline model specification. Section 3 briefly describes the estimation procedure and the posterior distribution of the model parameters. Section 4 characterizes the optimal policy in the baseline economy and compares the performance of alternative simple rules. Sections 5 and 6 analyze the implications of parameter uncertainty and innovation uncertainty, respectively. Section 7 considers several types of specification uncertainty. Section 8 concludes. The appendix contain some additional derivations and results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">The Model</head><p>As in CEE and SW, our baseline model incorporates a number of mechanisms that can induce intrinsic persistence in the propagation of shocks, including habit persistence in consumption, costs of adjustment for investment and capacity utilization, and staggered nominal wage and price contracts with partial indexation. The model also includes a number of exogenous disturbances (assumed to be mutually uncorrelated) that account for the stochastic variation in the observed data used in our estimation procedure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Household Preferences</head><p>The economy has a continuum of infinitely lived households. The conditional welfare of a given household h e [0, 1] at a given time t is defined as the discounted sum of expected period utility:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">00 Wt(h) = Et E8flj Vt+j(h),<label>(4.</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">1) j=0</formula><p>where the subjective discount factor is ft = /Ztb and we define +j = I=0o t+s. Thus, the steady-state subjective discount factor is given by the parameter 0 &lt; p &lt; 1, while stochastic variation in the rate of time preference is induced by the exogenous disturbance Zb; we assume that the logarithm of this disturbance follows an AR(1) process. The period utility function of a given household h at time t is specified as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">V(h) (Ct(h) -OCt-(h))1-" ZL(Lt(h))'+x zn(Mt(h))1-K Vt(h) = - +y 1 (4.2) 1-a 1+X 1-K</formula><p>where Ct(h) denotes the household's total consumption, Lt(h) denotes its labor hours, and Mt(h) denotes its real cash balances."1 The preference parameters, a, x, K, and o, are strictly positive, while 0 lies in the unit interval. The exogenous disturbance ZfL induces stochastic variation in household preferences for leisure relative to consumption, and Zn is an exogenous shock to money demand; the logarithm of each shock is assumed to follow an AR(1) process.</p><p>Habit persistence in consumption is an important but somewhat controversial feature of this specification. In particular, for positive values of 0, the household's lagged consumption effectively serves as a reference value in determining the period utility generated by current consumption.12 Recent empirical analysis of aggregate data has obtained substantial evidence of habit persistence; for example, CEE emphasize its role explaining the hump-shaped behavior of aggregate consumption in response to a monetary policy shock. Nevertheless, it should be noted that micro-level studies have occasionally obtained results that directly conflict with the macro evidence.13</p><p>Of course, the curvature parameters of the utility function also remain quite controversial. Some studies have argued that a is around unity, while others find much larger values.14 Furthermore, microeconometric studies have typically obtained estimates of x that are significantly greater than unity, whereas some macroeconomists have argued that the aggregate data are consistent with a near-zero value of X, corresponding to a very high intertemporal elasticity of leisure for the representative household. <ref type="bibr">'5</ref> Finally, while this specification allows real money balances to directly influence household utility, most of our analysis will focus on the cashless economy emphasized by  and others; this economy corresponds to the limiting case in which po becomes arbitrarily small. Later in the paper, however, we will revisit this issue and examine the policy implications of incorporating a nontrivial role for money into the model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Production and Prices</head><p>The final composite good-used for both consumption and investment-is obtained by bundling together a continuum of differentiated intermediate goods using a Dixit-Stiglitz aggregator function. As in SW, we allow the elasticity of substitution between different goods to exhibit exogenous temporal variation; that is, AP-= ZPp. The parameter AP &gt; 0 determines the steady-state markup rate, while the exogenous disturbance Z p (assumed to have an i.i.d. log-normal distribution) shifts the desired markup at each point in time. A given firm, indexed by i e [0, 1], as the sole producer of intermediate good i, faces a downward-sloping demand curve, and its elasticity of demand -(1 + ; P)/;ltp is invariant to the firm's level of production.16</p><p>Interestingly, the steady-state markup parameter AP does not influence the first-order dynamics of the model economy and hence cannot be estimated using the methods employed in this paper. Nevertheless, this parameter does affect the second-order properties of the model, including the welfare performance of monetary policy rules. In light of the available evidence from disaggregated data, we set AP = 0.20 in the baseline version of the model, and then consider alternative values from 0.1 to 0.5.17</p><p>Every intermediate-goods producer has an identical production function that determines the gross output of good i as a Cobb-Douglas function of the firm's employment of labor services Nt(i), its rental of capital services Kt(i), and the exogenous economy-wide productivity factor At:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">Yt(i) = AtKt (i) *Nt(i)1' -(D (4.3)</formula><p>where the parameter a represents the share of capital in gross output, and we assume that the logarithm of the productivity factor follows an AR(1) process. As in CEE and SW, every firm hires its capital and labor services on competitive economy-wide markets and hence has the same marginal cost of production. The firm's net output Yt(i) reflects the presence of the fixed overhead cost (. This fixed cost induces locally increasing returns to scale for each individual firm and generates procyclical total factor productivity at the aggregate level. Thus, inferences about the value of ( can be made using both micro-level and macro-level data.</p><p>In the baseline version of the model, we assume that prices are determined by Calvo-style nominal contracts with partial indexation.18 In particular, every firm faces a constant probability 1 -~p of reoptimizing its price contract in any given period, where ep e [0, 1]; thus, price contracts have an average duration 1/ <ref type="bibr">(1p)</ref>. Whenever the contract is not reoptimized, the firm's price is adjusted automatically by the lagged rate of inflation raised to the power yp ~ <ref type="bibr">[0,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1]</ref>. This specification of price-setting behavior provides formal underpinnings for the hybrid New Keynesian Phillips <ref type="bibr">curve.19</ref> In particular, the indexation parameter yp determines the relative weight on the backward-looking versus forward-looking terms in the hybrid Phillips curve. While the magnitude of these weights is subject to ongoing controversy, recent analysis of aggregate data seems to be largely consistent with the available microeconomic evidence indicating that indexation is not a typical characteristic of price adjustment. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">20</ref> Under the assumption that all firms have the same marginal cost, the responsiveness of inflation to current marginal cost is determined solely by the parameter ?p. Typically, as in SW, the estimated value of ?p tends to imply a relatively long average duration of price contracts that is inconsistent with recent microeconomic evidence.21 Several recent studies have shown that incorporating additional real rigiditiessuch as quasi-kinked demand and firm-specific capital-yields more plausible estimates of the degree of nominal rigidity.22 Nevertheless, analyzing the second-order implications of these mechanisms poses some technical challenges that remain to be addressed in the literature.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Investment and Capacity Utilization</head><p>Households own the entire stock of physical capital Kt. Capital accumulation is subject to adjustment costs that are assumed to be proportional to the squared growth rate of investment rather than the more traditional formulation involving the squared level of investment. As emphasized by CEE, this specification of adjustment costs can generate a hump-shaped response of aggregate investment to a monetary policy shock, consistent with the implications of an identified vector autoregression. While the formal microeconomic foundations of this mechanism were initially opaque, <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Basu and Kimball (2003)</ref> have subsequently shown that very similar implications can be obtained in a framework with planning delays in investment.</p><p>Thus, the capital stock owned by a given household h E [0, 1] evolves as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">Kt(h) = (1 -6)Kt-1(h) + [1 -1(z[It(h) 1)2] (h) (4.4)</formula><p>where Kt(h) denotes the household's beginning-of-period capital stock, and It(h) denotes the gross investment during period t. The depreciation rate is given by 6, and the parameter C gauges the magnitude of investment adjustment costs.23 Finally, the exogenous disturbance Z[ acts as an economy-wide shock to investment demand; its logarithm follows an AR(1) process. In each period, the aggregate flow of capital services Kt to the intermediate goods sector is defined as the capacity utilization rate Ut multiplied by the predetermined level of the physical capital stock, Kt-1. The capacity utilization rate can vary from its steady-state value of unity, but such variations are associated with a real resource cost. In particular, we specify the resource cost It(h) incurred by a given household h as a constant elasticity of substitution (CES) function of its capacity utilization Ut(h):</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">Ut (h)l+1 -1 Ut(h) = 1 + (4.5)</formula><p>1+where &gt; ? 0 and u &gt; 0.24 As emphasized by CEE, variable capacity utilization can effectively enhance the short-term flexibility of the economy in response to aggregate shocks. Nevertheless, the magnitude of the utilization cost parameter / is currently subject to a great deal of uncertainty due both to the scarcity of microeconomic evidence and to conflicting results from recent macroeconometric analysis. For example, CEE find that variations in capacity utilization play an important role in explaining the sluggish response of inflation to a monetary policy shock, whereas the results of  suggest that the aggregate effects of a technology shock are consistent only with relatively limited variations in capacity utilization.</p><p>Finally, following SW, we include an external finance premium shock Zq (assumed to have an i.i.d. log-normal distribution), which acts as a wedge between the risk-free real interest rate and the required expected rate of return on physical capital. Recent analysis of firm-level data has obtained precise estimates of the magnitude and cyclical behavior of the external finance premium (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Levin, Natalucci, and Zakrajsek 2004)</ref>. However, further theoretical and empirical research is clearly needed to elucidate the underpinnings and implications of this mechanism.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Employment and Wages</head><p>Households provide a continuum of differentiated labor services, which are bundled together using a Dixit-Stiglitz aggregator function and then rented to the intermediate sector. As in SW, we allow the elasticity of substitution between different types of labor services to exhibit exogenous temporal variation; that is, At-= ZIlw. The parameter i" &gt; 0 determines the steady-state markup of real wages over the marginal rate of substitution between consumption and leisure. The exogenous disturbance Zw' (assumed to have an i.i.d. log-normal distribution) shifts the desired wage markup at each point in time. Given this specification, a given household h e [0, 1], as the sole provider of the labor service of type h, faces a downward-sloping labor demand curve with elasticity -(1 + At )/t w.</p><p>In the baseline version of the model, we assume that wages are determined by Calvo-style nominal contracts with partial indexation.</p><p>In particular, each household faces a constant probability 1 -~, of reoptimizing its wage contract in any given period, where w, e [0, 1]. Whenever the contract is not reoptimized, the household's wage is automatically adjusted by the lagged rate of price inflation raised to the power yw e [0, 1]. The steady-state markup parameter ;w and the contract wage parameter r, cannot be identified independently from the log-linear dynamics of the model. Given the scarcity of disaggregated evidence on these two parameters, we proceed by calibrating AW = 0.20 (the same baseline value as for AP) and estimating the value of W,.25 We will then gauge the policy and welfare implications of alternative combinations of these two parameters that yield the same first-order behavior of the model. Because the wage-setting mechanism has crucial implications for the design of optimal monetary policy, we will also consider two modifications to the baseline specification, namely, indexation of wages to lagged wage inflation instead of lagged price inflation and the use of fixed-duration Taylor-style wage contracts instead of Calvo-style contracts. As we will see, these alternative specifications yield significantly different implications for monetary policy and welfare.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">Fiscal and Monetary Policy</head><p>We assume that government spending is exogenously determined and exhibits persistent variations; in particular, its logarithm follows an AR(1) process. As is evident from the previous discussion, government spending has no direct effects on either utility (through purchases of public goods) or production (perhaps via a stock of public capital); consideration of these channels, as well as automatic fiscal stabilizers, is deferred to future research.</p><p>Furthermore, we assume that the government offsets the steady-state effects of monopolistic distortions by enacting the appropriate magnitude of production and employment subsidies, which are financed via a constant level of lump-sum taxes. Thus, the deterministic steady state is Pareto-optimal in the baseline model with a zero inflation rate. Under these assumptions, we can focus our analysis on the stabilization task of monetary policy, abstracting from the complications that would arise if the central bank also played a role in trying to offset the effects of steady-state distortions.26</p><p>In estimating the model, we use a fairly simple monetary policy rule in which the short-term nominal interest rate responds to the lagged interest rate as well as to deviations of aggregate price inflation from target and of actual output from the level that would prevail in the absence of nominal inertia. This specification includes two additional exogenous shocks, namely, persistent AR(1) shifts in the inflation objective and transitory white-noise shocks to the current policy rate. In our normative analysis, of course, we consider the full Ramsey policy as well as alternative specifications of simple policy rules, and we assume that monetary policy does not exhibit any exogenous stochastic variation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Model Estimation</head><p>We employ Bayesian methods to estimate the log-linearized version of the model, using quarterly U.S. data over the period 1955:1 through 2001:4.27 In particular, we treat seven aggregate variables as directly observed: real consumption, real investment, real gross domestic product (GDP), real wages, total hours, GDP price inflation, and the federal funds rate.28 Because the rest of the model variables (such as the capital stock) are treated as unobserved, we use the Kalman filter in computing the likelihood function of the model.</p><p>As widely recognized in earlier work, certain structural parameters are not well-identified from the cyclical dynamics of the data. There-fore, we use long-term historical averages to specify the values of these parameters: the capital share parameter a = 0.36, the discount factor fl = 0.99 (corresponding to a steady-state real interest rate of about 4 percent), and the depreciation parameter = 0.025 (corresponding to an annual rate of about 10 percent). Similarly, we calibrate the output shares of consumption, investment, and government spending at cy = C/Y = 0.56, iy = 0.24, and gy = 0.20, respectively.29 Finally, we set the wage and price markup parameters 'w = AP = 0.2; in the following section, we will consider the implications of alternative values for these two parameters.</p><p>We formulate independent prior densities for each of the other thirty-one parameters of the model, namely, ten parameters related to preferences and technology, five coefficients of the empirical interest rate reaction function, and sixteen parameters of the data-generating processes for the disturbances. Overall, our prior is consistent with the previous literature and is relatively uninformative for most of the parameters; details are given in the appendix.30 Given these priors, we characterize the posterior distribution using a Metropolis-Hastings Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. Our estimation methodology is broadly similar to that of <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Lubik and Schorfheide (2005)</ref>; further details are provided in the appendix.31</p><p>In the remainder of this section, we focus on characterizing the posterior distribution of the key structural parameters. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 4</ref>.1 reports the posterior means and the 5 percent and 95 percent bounds for each of these parameters. Corresponding results for the parameters of the shock processes may be found in the appendix.</p><p>As depicted in figure 4.1, the macroeconomic data are quite informative regarding the parameters related to price and wage determination. In light of recent micro-based evidence obtained by <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Bils and Klenow (2004)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Golosov and Lucas (2003)</ref>, we specify a prior mean of 0.38 for the Calvo price-setting parameter cp, corresponding to an average contract duration of about 1.5 quarters; we employed the same prior mean for the Calvo wage parameter ,. In contrast, the posterior mean estimates for these two parameters imply an average contract duration of about five quarters, similar to the findings of CEE and SW.32 Furthermore, the posterior probability intervals of these estimates are relatively narrow, suggesting a fairly clear disconnect between the micro and macro evidence.</p><p>We impose relatively uninformative priors on the degree of price and wage indexation. The estimate of the degree of price indexation is near 0 and relatively precisely estimated; in contrast, the degree of wage indexation is found to be substantial but very imprecisely estimated. The lack of price indexation differs from SW but is consistent with the findings of <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Ireland (2001)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Edge, Laubach, and J. Williams (2003)</ref>. The macroeconomic data are somewhat less informative regarding other structural parameters. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">Figure 4</ref>.2 repeats the previous figure for the structural parameters not related to price and wage determination. Overall, the resulting estimates are consistent with estimates from the literature. Except for the parameters determining capacity utilization costs and habit persistence, the posteriors do not differ greatly from the respective priors. The finding of a relatively tight posterior distribution for the capacity utilization cost parameter occurs despite the imposition of a relatively loose prior and contrasts with the wide dispersion of estimates of this parameter in the literature.</p><p>One structural parameter that deserves further discussion is the returns to scale in production, 0. We chose a relatively tight prior centered on 1.08 for this parameter, based on the estimates of  and <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Basu and Fernald (1997)</ref>, who find fixed costs of between 3 and 10 percent. Our resulting mean estimate is 1.09. By comparison, when we imposed an uninformative prior, the mode estimate exceeded 2, a result consistent with the findings of SW but contrary to the micro evidence. Despite this difference in point estimates, in fact the data were not terribly informative about this parameter, as seen in the figure. Interestingly, imposing our prior on q resulted in a small estimate of  investment adjustment costs. Our estimate of investment adjustment costs are noticeably lower than SW but more in line with those reported by . For the monetary policy reaction function, we obtain the following estimation results:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">rt = 0.84rt-_ + 0.16[2.7(rt_1 -;t-1) + 0.10yt-1] (0.03) (0.3) (0.07) + 0.26Arrt + 0.51Ayt + r?

As for the monetary policy shocks, we find that the inflation target t7r has significant variation and exhibits very high persistence approaching that of a random walk, while the transitory disturbance rq/ has negligible variance. It should be noted that our modeling framework does not provide any rationale or potential benefits from a timevarying inflation target or from idiosyncratic disturbances to the policy rule. Thus, given our focus on policies that maximize social welfare, we henceforth eliminate these two shocks by setting their variances to 0.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Optimal Monetary Policy</head><p>In this section, we characterize the monetary policy implications of the baseline model at the posterior mean values of the estimated parameters, abstracting from uncertainty about the true structure of the economy. We start by considering the optimal policy under commitment that maximizes conditional expected welfare and then compare the performance of simple rules in which the short-term interest rate is adjusted in response to one or more observable variables.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">The Optimal Policy Problem</head><p>The optimal policy under commitment can be computed by formulating an infinite-horizon Lagrangian problem in which the central bank maximizes conditional expected social welfare subject to the full set of nonlinear constraints implied by the private sector's behavioral equations and the market-clearing conditions of the model economy.33 The first-order conditions of this problem are obtained by differentiating the Lagrangian with respect to each of the endogenous variables (including the policy instrument) and setting these derivatives to 0. Of course, performing these derivations by hand would be extremely tedious; thus, we utilize the symbolic Matlab procedures developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Levin and Lopez-Salido (2004)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">34</ref> We then proceed to analyze the behavior of the economy under optimal policy by combining the central bank's first-order conditions together with the private sector's behavioral equations and the marketclearing conditions. Thus, the size of the model is much larger under the optimal policy because these first-order conditions take the place of a single interest rate reaction function, while the set of Lagrange multipliers is added to the list of model variables. Nevertheless, it should be emphasized that no new parameters have been added to the model because the central bank's first-order conditions involve the same structural parameters as in the behavioral equations and marketclearing conditions.</p><p>Because this set of nonlinear equations involves rational expectations, numerical methods are required to characterize the equilibrium properties of the stochastic economy.35 Furthermore, while the first-order dynamics can be investigated by log-linearizing the model, higher-order methods are needed to evaluate conditional expected welfare.36 Therefore, we employ the Dynare software package of <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Juillard (2001)</ref> to compute the second-order approximation of the model economy.37</p><p>Finally, as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Levin and Lopez-Salido (2004)</ref>, our analysis is focused on evaluating the welfare cost of business cycles; that is, for each monetary policy regime, we measure how conditional expected welfare changes in response to the stochastic variation of the model economy.38 Throughout the paper, welfare costs are expressed in terms of the equivalent percentage decline in steady-state consumption.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Characteristics of Optimal Policy</head><p>The deterministic steady state of the baseline economy is characterized by a 0 inflation rate. In particular, as noted above, we assume that fiscal subsidies offset the steady-state monopolistic distortions to production and employment, while money is essentially absent from the baseline specification. Thus, in the absence of stochastic shocks, the central bank's sole task is to choose the constant inflation rate that minimizes the degree of cross-sectional dispersion in prices and wages; indeed, by maintaining a 0 inflation rate, monetary policy succeeds in implementing the Pareto-optimal equilibrium in steady state.</p><p>The first-order implications of the optimal policy are shown in figure 4.3, which depicts the response of selected macro variables to an exogenous rise in the productivity factor.39 The optimal policy (solid line) yields a path of short-term real interest rates that closely resembles that of the real business cycle (RBC) economy with flexible wages and prices (dotted line); in contrast, real interest rates are nearly constant under the empirical reaction function (dashed line). In the RBC economy, real wages initially rise about 0.75 percent; with a constant price level, this adjustment occurs solely through a surge in nominal wage inflation. In contrast, the optimal policy for the baseline economy is mainly oriented towards minimizing cross-sectional dispersion in wage rates and hence permits a noticeable decline in prices while nominal wage inflation remains close to 0. Under the optimal policy (as in the RBC economy), the positive shock to productivity induces a substantial decline in aggregate labor hours that is gradually reversed over the subsequent year. Under the empirical reaction function, labor hours decline only for a single quarter and then rise above baseline. These findings relate to the debate regarding the empirical evidence of the response of hours to productivity shocks and the sensitivity of these results to monetary policy. We now compare the welfare implications of these policies for the baseline economy with stochastic variation in all of the exogenous disturbances except the monetary policy shocks. For each policy, table 4.2 reports the welfare cost of business cycles in terms of the equivalent percentage point change in steady-state consumption; this table also indicates welfare outcomes for two simple rules that are discussed further below.</p><p>Under the empirical reaction function, the welfare cost of business cycles in the baseline model is equivalent to a permanent 2.6 percent reduction in household consumption. The optimal policy is associated with a markedly lower cost of business cycles, equivalent to about 2 percent of steady-state consumption. It should be noted that these welfare costs are an order of magnitude larger than in the results emphasized by <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">Lucas (2003)</ref> mainly because staggered contracts induce substantial cross-sectional dispersion in relative prices and wages.40</p><p>To gauge these welfare results more concretely, we note that U.S. personal consumption expenditures were about $28,000 per person in 2004; thus, switching from the empirical reaction function to the optimal policy would permanently raise welfare by about $160 per person, while eliminating all stochastic variation in the economy would generate a permanent welfare gain exceeding $700 per person. As we will see below, however, the magnitude of the welfare costs can be quite sensitive to the parameter values of the model as well as to the specification of the innovations and the determination of wages and prices.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Simple Policy Rules</head><p>We now consider the performance of simple policy rules with coefficients chosen to maximize welfare in the baseline model.41 In particular, we examine rules with the following form: rt = rirt-1 + r7rt + ro,cot <ref type="bibr">(4.6)</ref> where the nominal interest rate rt responds to the price inflation rate 7rt and the nominal wage inflation rate wt as well as to the lagged nominal interest rate. This type of rule is operational in the sense of <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">McCallum (1999)</ref>: the policy instrument is determined only by observable variables and not by model-specific constructed data such as the natural rates of interest and output, and forecasts of variables (which require knowledge of the economy).42 Furthermore, it is equivalent to targeting a deterministic path for the level of wages or prices; such policies have been shown to perform very well in the presence of the 0 lower bound on nominal interest rates.43 Given the role of wage dispersion in determining the welfare cost of business cycles, it is useful to consider policy rules that respond directly to nominal wage inflation, as suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Erceg, Henderson, and Levin (2000)</ref>.44 Therefore, we consider a hybrid rule that responds differentially to both price and wage inflation, as well as rules that respond to price inflation alone. Optimizing the coefficients of the hybrid rule to maximize welfare in the baseline model, we find that r,, = 3.2 while r,, = 0. Thus, given that the optimized rule does not actually respond to price inflation, we simply refer to this rule as the benchmark wage inflation rule. We then compare its performance to an alternative rule that does not respond to wages-henceforth referred to as the benchmark price inflation rule-for which welfare optimization yields r, = 2.1.</p><p>As indicated in table 4.2, the benchmark wage inflation rule yields a welfare outcome nearly identical to the optimal policy; indeed, following this simple wage inflation rule rather than the optimal policy would incur a welfare cost equivalent to less than $35 per person per year. In contrast, the benchmark price inflation rule yields a welfare loss that is roughly the same as under the empirical reaction function.</p><p>The impulse responses to the technology shock under the benchmark wage inflation rule mimics closely those of the optimal policy, as seen in figure 4.4. One difference is that the benchmark wage inflation rule initially tightens monetary policy, causing a slightly excessive fall in labor hours and consumption at the onset of the shock. After a few quarters, however, the benchmark wage inflation rule gets back on track, and the paths of labor hours, consumption, and price and wage inflation are virtually identical to those obtained under the optimal policy. In contrast, the benchmark price inflation rule is overly stimulative at the onset of the shock, keeping price inflation near baseline but generating excessive nominal wage inflation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Parameter Uncertainty</head><p>In this section, we explore the sensitivity of household welfare to variations in the parameters under the wage inflation policy rule optimized to the baseline parameters discussed in Section 3. We evaluate the performance of this rule in comparison with that of the optimal policy determined using the true values of the model parameters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Estimated Parameters</head><p>We start by considering the effect of uncertainty as measured by our estimated posterior distribution. We compute the welfare losses associated with joint parameter uncertainty of the ten structural parameters together.45 For this purpose, we randomly select 5,000 draws of the parameter vector from the posterior distribution described above. For each draw, we compute welfare under the optimal policy for the true set of parameters and under the benchmark wage inflation policy. Note that this method incorporates the covariance between the model parameters, allowing for the possibility that particular combinations of parameter realizations may have sizeable effects on outcomes. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">Figure  4</ref>.5 reports the results from this exercise; the upper panel shows the resulting distributions of welfare losses under the two policies, and the lower panel shows the distribution of the relative welfare loss equal to the difference in welfare between the optimal policy and the benchmark wage inflation rule. Uncertainty about the structural parameters implies a great deal of uncertainty regarding the welfare loss associated with fluctuations, but far less uncertainty regarding the performance of the benchmark wage inflation rule relative to the optimal policy. As seen in the upper panel of the figure, the distribution of welfare losses under either policy is wide with a relatively long left tail. Under the optimal policy, the median welfare loss is 2.1 percent, just 0.1 percentage point larger than for the posterior mean estimates, but the 90 percent confidence interval for the welfare loss ranges from 4.3 percent to 0.9 percent. The results under the benchmark wage inflation rule are comparable. Thus, parameter uncertainty can easily make the welfare costs of fluctuations more than double what we estimate, or half as large, for that matter. However, as the lower panel of the figure shows, the performance of the benchmark wage inflation rule relative to the optimal policy is remarkably robust to parameter uncertainty. Indeed, the mean relative welfare loss, evaluated over the posterior distribution, is 0.14 percent, compared to 0.12 percent assuming no uncertainty, and the 90 percent probability interval for the relative welfare loss is fairly narrow, ranging from 0.06 to 0.35 percent.</p><p>Because the benchmark rule performs so well across the posterior distribution, it is not surprising that taking account of parameter uncertainty as measured by the posterior distribution has almost no effect on the parameters or expected performance of the optimized wage inflation rule. We computed the coefficient of a wage inflation rule that  maximizes expected welfare integrating over the posterior distribution as above. The optimal coefficient equals 2.9, slightly lower than the value of 3.2 in the case of no uncertainty. But this rule yields an increase in expected welfare relative to the benchmark wage inflation rule of only 0.0004 percent. Thus, the existence of parameter uncertainty, as measured by the posterior distribution, is nearly irrelevant for designing policy in this model. Of course, a significant reduction in this uncertainty could have implications for the design of policy and welfare, as we examine next.</p><p>The degree of parameter uncertainty represented by the posterior distribution likely understates the true degree of uncertainty that policymakers face. As discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">Onatski and N. Williams (2003)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Lubik and Schorfheide (2005)</ref>, the mean and spread of the posterior distributions are highly sensitive to the assumed prior distributions. Point estimates and their standard errors are sensitive to estimation methodology, sample, and the values of calibrated parameters.46 This sensitivity is illustrated by the wide range of point estimates for various model parameters found in what are nearly identical models studied in CEE, SW, and this paper.</p><p>Given this concern that the degree of parameter uncertainty may exceed that implied by the posterior distribution, we now examine the robustness of the benchmark wage inflation rule to a much wider set of parameter values. A second goal of this analysis is to uncover which parameters entail costly consequences when an estimate is far from the true value. To facilitate our analysis, we vary specific parameters one at a time, holding all other parameters at their respective mean estimates. We focus our analysis on the difference in welfare between that found under the benchmark wage inflation rule and the optimal policy for the specified parameter. Again, we measure the potential loss in switching from the optimal policy (assuming that the true parameter value is known) to the benchmark wage inflation rule (optimized for the baseline parameters).</p><p>We start with the parameters describing price and wage determination. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">Figure 4</ref>.6 plots the differences in the consumption-equivalent welfare losses between the optimal policy and the benchmark wage inflation rule as the four parameters related to price-and wage-setting are varied. The results for the Calvo parameters are shown in the upper panels; the results for the indexation parameters are shown in the lower panels. The vertical lines indicate the 5 percent and 95 percent posterior bounds for the parameters calculated from the MCMC simulations. If the resulting plotted line is horizontal, estimation error for that parameter has no welfare costs, while a steeply sloped line indicates that parameter estimation error carries high costs and that better estimates could have a large social benefit.</p><p>Although uncertainty regarding the wage and price parameters based on the estimated probability intervals has very modest implications for the performance of the benchmark wage inflation rule, looked at from a broader or an explicitly min-max perspective, reducing uncertainty about price-and wage-setting parameters could yield moderate benefits in terms of monetary policy design and welfare. The relative performance of the benchmark wage inflation rule is sensitive to very high values of the Calvo wage parameter. For the other Calvo price and indexation parameters, the performance of the benchmark wage inflation policy drops off if prices are reoptimized very frequently or if a high share of contracts is indexed, neither of which is likely according to the posterior distribution. For example, consider the case that the true Calvo price parameter, cp, is as low as some of the micro evidence suggests. According to the posterior distribution, such a low value is extremely unlikely. But if true, knowledge of this parameter could be used to design a monetary policy that yields a moderate improvement in welfare. The same applies for the Calvo  wage and price indexation parameters. Although the degree of wage indexation is imprecisely estimated, the relative welfare loss is nearly invariant to the value of this parameter. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">Figure 4</ref>.7 plots the results for the parameters related to preferences and technology. Given the estimated precision of these parameter estimates, parameter uncertainty has trivial implications for welfare and therefore for policy. For example, although x, the parameter measuring the disutility of labor, is imprecisely estimated, it has only a modest effect on relative welfare.</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">Calvo Price (,p) Calvo Wage (w,) 0 0 -0.2 ' 0-0.2 -I -0.4 wo-0.4 -0.6 -0.6 -0.8 -0.8 -1 -1 0 0.5 1 0 0.5 1 Price Indexation (Yp) Wage Indexation (,w) 0 0' -0.2 -0.2 0 --0.4 -0.4 - -0.6 -0.6 -0.8 -0.8 -1 -1 0 0.5 1 0 0.5 Parameter Parameter</formula><p>It should be noted that the parameter 0, which measures the degree of increasing returns, does have a significant effect on relative welfare under the benchmark wage rule. With a loose prior, we would estimate a value for this parameter near 2. Assuming that the results of the literature indicating at most modest increasing returns are true, the resulting reduction in uncertainty has a large effect on welfare in this model, assuming policy is designed to be optimal at the baseline estimates. Moreover, our estimate of the habit persistence parameter is on the low side of recent estimates, which tend to find values in the 0.5-0.7 range. Once again, we find such values to be unlikely, but we find a significant drop in the performance of the benchmark wage inflation rule when the habit parameter increases past 0.5. Finally, knowledge of the true magnitude of investment adjustment costs would be valuable for policy design.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Steady-State Markups</head><p>As noted above, we cannot estimate the steady-state price and wage markups using the first-order dynamics of the model but instead calibrate both to be 20 percent. Given the uncertainty regarding the values of these parameters, we briefly explore the implications of alternative calibrations of the steady-state markups for monetary policy.</p><p>The magnitude of welfare losses depends on the steady-state price markup, but the performance of the benchmark wage inflation rule relative to the optimal policy is insensitive to this parameter. We evaluate the welfare losses under four representative monetary policies analyzed above as AP is varied from 0.1 to 0.5, holding all other parameters fixed. Recall that the steady-state price markup does not affect the firstorder properties of the system.47 The results are shown in the upper part of table 4.3. Welfare losses are larger when the steady-state price markup is smaller, reflecting the effect of greater dispersion when goods are more highly substitutable. The relative performance of the various policies is insensitive to the value of the steady-state price markup.</p><p>The welfare losses are highly sensitive to the value of the steadystate wage markup, and for very high values of this parameter, the performance of the benchmark price inflation policy rule approaches that of the benchmark wage inflation rule. In considering the effects of variations in 2", we vary the value of Calvo wage parameter, ?,, so that the first-order properties of the model are constant.48 We hold all other parameter values fixed at baseline values. Note that even with a high steady-state wage markup, the benchmark wage inflation policy rule performs well, although the difference between it and the rules that respond to price inflation is much smaller than in the baseline model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Innovation Uncertainty</head><p>We now consider alternative assumptions regarding the set of shocks in the model. In computing welfare, we have had to take a stand on each shock as to whether it reflects shifts in fundamentals, the effects of distortions, or measurement error. In particular, we have assumed that the wage and price shocks and the shocks to the external finance premium are distortionary, while the remaining shocks reflect shifts in fundamentals. We now revisit these assumptions and evaluate the performance of the various monetary policies under alternative assumptions regarding the nature of innovations. The baseline model is admittedly profligate in specifying shocks. In particular, the external finance premium has a large estimated variance and may be important for welfare according to the model but arguably lacks micro-foundations. It is important to note that we have assumed that this shock does not affect fundamentals but instead represents inefficient fluctuations in an external finance premium or a type of "animal spirits" that monetary policy should counteract. Therefore, we consider an alternative model specification in which these shocks do not exist; that is, Tobin's Q strictly follows fundamentals. We assume that these shocks represent measurement error evident in estimating the model but that they have no effects on the actual allocation of resources. We do not re-estimate the model, but rather we simply set the variance of the external finance premium shocks to 0.49 The second line of table 4.4 reports the results from this experiment. Eliminating the external finance premium shocks has little effect on welfare or on the relative performance of the various policy rules. We further examine how the policy rules perform under alternative assumptions regarding the nature of shocks to price and wage markups. In the baseline model, these shocks are viewed as being distortionary movements in markups. We now consider the possibility that these disturbances simply reflect measurement error that the econometrician faces in estimating the model. In implementing this idea, we do not reestimate the model, but instead simply zero out the markup innovations. We continue to assume that the policymaker is able to measure wage and price inflation accurately, that is, absent measurement error. (If the markup shocks in fact represented measurement error that the policymaker confronts, then the performance of the policy rules that we consider would deteriorate.) We consider each shock in isolation and the combined effect. The results are shown in the upper part of table 4.4.</p><p>Eliminating either markup shock reduces the welfare costs of fluctuations but does not alter the relative performance of the various policy rules. In either case, the welfare gap between the optimal policy and the benchmark wage inflation rule is reduced relative to that in the baseline specification. The price shocks have relatively little effect on welfare; the wage shocks, however, are an important source of welfare loss under both the optimal and the benchmark policies but nevertheless have little effect on the relative performance of the benchmark wage inflation policy rule.</p><p>Finally, we consider the nature of disturbances to preferences. In the baseline model, we have assumed that shocks to time preference and the disutility of labor reflect fundamental movements in the economy that monetary policy should accommodate. We consider two alternative assumptions. First, we assume that the shocks merely reflect measurement error and evaluate the four policies under the assumption that the preference shock does not exist. As before, we consider each shock in isolation. Eliminating either preference shock increases welfare under the various policies by about 0.25 percentage point; that is, stochastic shocks to preferences are welfare-enhancing in our baseline model.50 The performance of the benchmark wage inflation rule relative to the optimal policy is almost unchanged. Second, we consider the assumption that the preference shocks reflect nonfundamentals, such as changes in tax rates. The results are shown in the lower section of table 4.4. In this case, the welfare losses are significantly higher than in the baseline model, but again the performance of the benchmark wage inflation rule relative to the optimal policy does not deteriorate.</p><p>Regardless of the assumption about the nature of these shocks, the benchmark wage inflation rule is nearly optimal and outperforms the estimated and benchmark price inflation rules by a significant margin. In summary, although innovation uncertainty exacerbates the already significant uncertainty about the magnitude of the welfare costs of fluctuations, the benchmark wage inflation rule is remarkably robust to changes in assumptions regarding the nature of shocks hitting the economy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Specification Uncertainty</head><p>We now proceed to consider the broader problem of specification uncertainty in the sense of <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Leamer (1978)</ref>.51 In specifying the baseline model, we made numerous choices that affect the parameter estimates, the structure of the model, and the determinants of welfare. In this section, we analyze the sensitivity of optimal policies to alternate assumptions regarding the model specification and evaluate the marginal benefit of reducing uncertainty of each of the key specification issues in terms of social welfare. As in the preceding section, this analysis provides information on the value, from the perspective of monetary policy, of improving our knowledge of specification issues and suggests where the highest payoffs are for further research in this area. While the list of specifications we consider is far from exhaustive, it provides some examples of the type of specification uncertainty that may be important for policy analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1">Monetary Frictions and Working Capital</head><p>Our baseline model can be viewed as a cashless economy that completely abstracts from monetary frictions. We now investigate the policy implications of incorporating household demand for money as well as working-capital considerations for firms. First, we permit the scale parameter po to have a nontrivial value, so that real money balances have direct effects on household utility. Second, following CEE, we assume that firms must borrow from financial intermediaries to cover their wage bill and then repay the loan at the end of the period. Thus, assuming that these funds can be obtained at the gross risk-free nominal interest rate, firms' total labor costs are now given by RtWtLt.</p><p>Since we specify that policy is conducted via an interest rate rule, we do not need to concern ourselves with market clearing in the loan market. This would only serve to pin down the value of broad money. Instead, we simply append the portfolio allocation decision to determine the household's cash balances (which now affect welfare), and we incorporate the effects of working capital on firms' labor demand and marginal costs. We then re-estimate the model, using data on cash balances in addition to the seven variables noted above.52 The mode estimate of the preference parameter K is 11.4, while the mode estimates of all other model parameters are nearly the same as in the baseline specification.53</p><p>The modified model has two key implications for policy. First, owing to the effects of nominal interest rates on costs and money balances, the optimal inflation rate is no longer 0 but is instead slightly below 0. Second, there is a cost to highly variable nominal interest rates that is absent in the baseline model and a resultant benefit to smoothing interest rates. As a result, the optimal wage inflation policy rule responds less aggressively to wage inflation, with a coefficient of 1.5, compared to 3.2 in the baseline model.54 The benchmark wage inflation rule yields a welfare loss of 0.07 percentage points in terms of permanent consumption greater than a rule optimized for this alternative model with monetary frictions and working capital.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2">Alternative Models of Wage Setting</head><p>A key result in our analysis is the importance of stabilizing wages owing to the distortions associated with wage dispersion under Calvostyle contracts. Given the central role of this channel, we consider alternative specifications of wage setting that have significant effects on the welfare implications of sticky wages and on optimal policy. In particular, we consider two alternative specifications in which the effects of wage dispersion on welfare are muted relative to the Calvo-style model.55</p><p>We first consider a modest modification to the indexation of wages in the model and assume that nonoptimized wages are indexed to last period's wage inflation rate, as opposed to the rate of price inflation. This modification reduces the effects of fluctuations in wage inflation on wage dispersion and thereby on welfare.56 <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 4</ref>.4 reports the results from this specification for four specifications of monetary policy. Not surprisingly, the consumption-equivalent loss in conditional welfare under the optimal policy is somewhat smaller than in the baseline model.</p><p>The relative performance of the benchmark wage inflation rule is considerably worse, however, under this form of wage indexation and is dominated by the rule that responds only to price inflation. Under the benchmark wage inflation policy rule, the consumption-equivalent loss in conditional welfare is 0.6 percentage points larger than under the optimal policy and 0.3 percentage points higher than under the benchmark price inflation rule. In fact, with this specification of wage indexation, the benchmark wage inflation policy rule does slightly worse than the estimated policy rule. Evidently, the result that a simple policy rule designed to maximize welfare should respond exclusively to wage inflation is not robust to changes in the model of wage determination, even to this seemingly innocuous change in the model specification.</p><p>We now consider a more substantive change in the specification of wage and price determination, and assume that contracts have fixed duration as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b138">Taylor (1980)</ref>; see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Chari, Kehoe, and McGrattan (2000)</ref>.57 Compared with the baseline specification of Calvo-style contracts with random duration, this alternative specification limits the degree of price and wage dispersion-and the associated welfare costs-resulting from the presence of some prices and wages that have not been reoptimized for many periods. We suppose that nominal wages and prices are determined by staggered contracts that are reset every M periods. Thus, at t the distribution of wages is given by {Wt, j} where j <ref type="bibr">= 1,... ,M denotes</ref> the number of periods since the last reset. In particular, we assume that all price and wage contracts last for four quarters, implying mean contract durations somewhat shorter than implied by our posterior mean estimates of the Calvo update parameters, ?p and 5,. We do not change any other parameter estimates and revert to the baseline assumption that wages are indexed to past price inflation. The results are reported in table 4.5. As expected, replacing Calvo-style wage and price setting with Taylor-style contracts significantly reduces wage and price dispersion and hence the welfare costs associated with fluctuations.</p><p>With Taylor-style staggered wages and prices, the relative performance of the benchmark wage inflation rule falls dramatically, while the estimated policy rule is nearly optimal. The benchmark price inflation rule outperforms the benchmark wage inflation rule but falls behind the estimated rule. With Taylor price and wage contracts, the welfare costs associated with price and wage dispersion are relatively modest and therefore the optimal policy focuses on coming close to the real allocation in the flexible wage and price economy. The estimated rule accomplishes this balance very well, while the benchmark price inflation rule is somewhat less effective owing to a lack of response to the output gap. The performance of the benchmark wage inflation rule suffers more significantly because it implicitly puts far too much emphasis on stabilizing nominal wage inflation relative to achieving the flexible wage and price real allocation.58</p><p>Finally, it should be noted that the welfare cost of business cycles and the performance of alternative monetary policies are sensitive not only to the structure of nominal contracts but to the specification of household preferences. For example, as in CEE and SW, our analysis has followed <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Erceg, Henderson, and Levin (2000)</ref> in assuming that each individual household provides a distinct labor service, whereas Schmitt-Grohe and Uribe (2004) assume that each household has a continuum of members providing all types of labor services and that the household's utility depends only on its total hours of work. While such assumptions might seem to be merely technical details, in fact these differences have fairly dramatic consequences for the firstorder dynamics of wage inflation, the second-order effects of crosssectional wage dispersion, and the design of welfare-maximizing policy rules.59</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">Conclusion</head><p>Over the past decade, there has been remarkable progress in developing empirical micro-founded macroeconomic models for monetary policy analysis. In this paper, we have drawn on and extended this literature to consider the design of policy under uncertainty. By confronting a fully specified dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model with the data, we can directly gauge the uncertainty associated with the model parameters as well as the implications of alternative assumptions about the model specification.</p><p>Our analysis indicates that the welfare cost of business cycles is quite large-an order of magnitude larger than the findings emphasized by <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">Lucas (2003)</ref>-and arises mainly due to inefficiencies associated with cross-sectional dispersion in wages and employment. As a direct consequence, we find that the welfare outcome associated with optimal policy under commitment is closely matched by a very simple rule that responds solely to nominal wage inflation. Furthermore, the performance of this benchmark wage inflation rule is robust to uncertainty about the structural parameters and the particular shocks hitting the economy. The performance of this rule, however, is very sensitive to the specification of wage and price determination, suggesting that a hybrid rule involving both wage and price inflation might be more robust across a broader class of models.</p><p>These findings underscore the central importance of labor markets for analyzing the welfare costs of macroeconomic fluctuations and the design of monetary policy. Of course, the crucial role of wage setting and employment dynamics has long been recognized, and recent research has refocused interest on these issues; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Hall (2005)</ref>. Thus, further progress in formulating micro-founded specifications of labor market behavior and comparing the empirical performance of these specifications is likely to have substantial payoffs for the design of monetary policy.</p><p>Finally, while our analysis has emphasized the implications of policymaker uncertainty regarding the true structure of the economy, we have abstracted completely from the role of learning by policymakers or private agents. Nevertheless, we recognize that the learning mechanism is crucial for understanding the evolution of the economy in response to changes in the monetary policy regime-such as the Volcker disinflation-and to other aggregate disturbances.60 Thus, incorporating learning in micro-founded macroeconometric models and reconsidering the policy implications represents a natural direction for future research.61 9 Appendix 9.1 The Nonlinear Model 9.1.1 The Baseline Model The text describes the household side, and we now fill in some detail on the firm side.

The household's budget constraint is standard, and households trade in a complete market to allocate their consumption over time. Let MUCt denote the marginal utility associated with an incremental increase in consumption in period t, accounting for its effect on period utility in the period t + 1:</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">MUCt = Zb(ct -Ctl)-a flOEtZb+ Ct+- t)- (4.9)</formula><p>The consumption Euler equation summarizes the representative household's optimal saving behavior:</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">MUCt = Et[MUCt+lR tPt/Pt+1] (4.10)</formula><p>where Rt is the gross nominal interest rate and Pt is the price level. Households set wages subject to their individual labor demand curves, which arise from the firms' input demands.

Households own the capital stock, Kt, which they accumulate using the capital accumulation technology and rent to firms at rental rate Rt. This leads to three key relationships. First, we let Qt be the real share value per unit of capital, which is determined by an asset pricing Euler equation from equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">4.10</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">Qt -Et[l M (Qt+l(1 -6) + Ut+1l - T(Ut-+)) (4.13)</formula><p>where Zq is the i.i.d. external finance premium shock.

We specify policy in terms of a generalized Taylor-type rule, where the policy authority sets nominal rates in response to inflation and the output gap. To do this, we define a modelconsistent output gap as the difference between actual and potential output, where potential output is defined as what would prevail under flexible prices and wages and in the absence of the three cost-push shocks (Z,,,Z , Zq) that cause variations in wage and price markups and the external finance premium. Thus, the model is supplemented with flexible-price versions of the key equations <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">4.10) through (4.18</ref>, which determine potential output Yt*. Then the policy rule is assumed to take the following form: rt = rirt-1 + (1ri)(itt + r,(7t-1 -t7*1) + ry log(Yt-1/YW1)) + ra(7rt -7t-1) + ray{log(Yt/Yt*) log(Yt-1/Y 1)1 + t+ <ref type="bibr">(4.20)</ref> Here, rt = log Rt is the short-term interest rate, 7rt = A In(Pt/Pt_1) is the inflation rate, 7r* is an AR(1) shock to the inflation objective, and q R is an i.i.d. policy shock.</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">P , Pt-l+ +- (1 - p)Pt1i</formula></div>

The remaining four shocks, {,P, qW, i l[ ,}, are assumed to be i.i.d. with mean zero and variance a4. The innovations are assumed to have zero contemporaneous correlation. The full model also includes counterparts to equations (4.26) through (4.33) that describe the log-linearized equations for the flexible-price allocation. In these equations, the shocks ilp, lq, and q, are set to 0, as is the inflation rate. The nominal interest rate is replaced by the flexible-price real interest rate, r*. This yields nine equations and nine additional variables, {cl, i , y , w*, I, qt*, rt*, rt*, kt }, where the asterisk superscript denotes the flexible-price value of the variable.</p><p>We close the model by including the linearized counterpart to the policy rule: rt = rirt-1 + (1ri)(rt + r,(7rt-1 -7r1_) + ry(yt-1 -Yt-1)) + ran(rtt-1) + ray(yt -Yt* -(yt-1 -Ye-1)) + r[ <ref type="bibr">(4.36)</ref> 9.2.2 Model with Monetary Frictions Here, we note the modifications to the expressions above when we consider the model with monetary frictions.

For the standard deviations, we used gamma distributions with standard deviations equal to the means. We gauged the relative magnitudes of the shocks from Onatski and N.  and SW. For all but one persistence parameter, we used a wide beta distribution. The exception was the inflation objective shock. Since it and the interest rate shock enter additively in the policy rule of equation <ref type="bibr">(4.37)</ref>, a tighter prior is necessary to distinguish between them. For the structural parameters, we chose the parameters of the distributions to cover the range of estimates we found in the literature with reasonably high probability.</p><p>9.3.2 Computation of the Posterior As in SW, we first look for a parameter vector that maximizes the posterior mode, given our prior and the likelihood based on the data. We took great efforts to explore the  parameter space sufficiently to locate a global maximum. In particular, we sampled 200 values from the prior distribution and used these as starting values for Chris Sims's optimization algorithms designed to avoid common problems with likelihood functions (these algorithms are available on his web page, http://www.princeton.edu/~sims). We reran it in combination with a standard hill-climber algorithm until it settled on the maximal value. We used the resulting mode as the starting point for our MCMC sampling. We then sample from the posterior distribution using a Metropolis-Hastings Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm in order to make small sample inferences about the parameters. We sampled ten separate chains for 45,000 periods each, discarding the first 15,000   periods. Thus, we were left with 300,000 points from the posterior distribution. In order to assess convergence of the Markov chains, we use the potential scale reduction statistic described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Gelman, Carlin, Stem, and Rubin (2004)</ref>, which gave clear indications of convergence for all the parameters.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9.4">Optimal Policy</head><p>Here, we report the impulse responses to other shocks. In response to positive shocks to wages and Tobin's Q, the optimal policy calls for a  sharp increase in interest rates that causes a large decline in consumption. The contractionary policy response reduces the responses of wages. In contrast, the estimated policy rule accommodates the shocks to a greater degree and allows larger rises in wage inflation. The optimal policy response to a transitory shock to prices, however, is to do almost nothing. The estimated policy rule reacts to the rise in inflation, sending real rates higher and reducing consumption and aggregate labor. See figures 4.9 through 4.12.</p></div>

The real wage is constructed as nonfarm wage rate adjusted by the GDP price deflator, while total hours are measured for the nonfarm business sector.

In addition, the welfare costs of fluctuations are very sensitive to the assumed degree of substitutability across types of labor and of goods, parameters that we take as fixed in this analysis.</p><p>47. Note that we do not impose a relationship between the fixed cost parameter and the markup implied by a zero-profit condition.</p><p>48. Thus, we isolate the effects of changing the substitutability of different types of labor on welfare from those on the sensitivity of wages to movements in the marginal rate of substitution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>49</head><p>. In a previous version of this paper, we estimated an alternative model that included no external finance premium shocks. Estimates of most model parameters were nearly identical to the baseline estimates. Exceptions included the estimate of C, which fell, implying significantly higher costs of adjusting investment, and the investment adjustment cost shock became more variable and less persistent. The effects on welfare of this specification were modest.</p><p>50. Because a shock to preferences affects only welfare and not the production possibilities of the economy, with flexible wages and prices, welfare is nondecreasing to a meanpreserving spread to preferences.</p><p>51. For some early analysis of specification uncertainty in structural models, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Becker, Dwolatsky, Karakitsos, and Rustem (1986)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Frankel and Rockett (1988)</ref>.</p><p>52. The money data are available only from 1959 onward, so we shorten the sample by four years. Linearized expressions are given in the appendix.</p><p>53. Complete estimation results are reported in Section 9.3 of the appendix.</p><p>54. It is still the case that the optimal coefficient on price inflation is 0.</p><p>55. Although not considered here, another model of wage and price setting that does not yield dispersion effects on aggregate welfare is the quadratic adjustment costs model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">Rotemberg (1982)</ref>.</p><p>56. We estimated a version of the baseline model where wage indexation depends on a combination of past price and wage inflation. We found that the weight is primarily on past price inflation, providing support for the baseline model specification. Nonetheless, one may not be convinced by this finding and remain concerned about uncertainty regarding the form of wage indexation.</p><p>57. As explained below, we have not formally estimated this alternative specification. The empirical performance of the model may be sensitive to which type of nominal rigidity is assumed; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Chari, Kehoe, and McGrattan (2000)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Kiley (2002)</ref>; and <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Guerrieri (2001)</ref>.</p><p>58. We also examined a version of the model with Taylor wage contracts and Calvo prices. The results were very similar to those found when both wages and prices are set by Taylor contracts.</p><p>59. The specification of <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Erceg, Henderson, and Levin (2000)</ref> implies a much flatter nominal wage Phillips curve; that is, nominal wage inflation is much less sensitive to the marginal rate of substitution between consumption and leisure. Furthermore, cross-sectional wage dispersion induces differences in labor across households that have substantial effects on social welfare.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 4 . 1 Estimated</head><label>41</label><figDesc>Posterior Distributions (Solid Lines) and Prior Distributions (Dashed) for the Price and Wage Parameters</figDesc></figure>
