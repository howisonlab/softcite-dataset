				<p>Objective To compare the voice onset time (VOT) differences of Korean stops in the initial and intervocalic positions between the aphasic patients with peculiarities of aspiration and a control group. Method We examined 15 aphasic patients (nine males, six females) who had suff ered a stroke (average age 49.7 years) and 15 healthy controls (average age 47.4 years). An aphasia examination was made by an aphasia battery of three standard tests and VOT was analyzed instrumentally. Stop consonants in the initial and intervocalic position were measured to categorize them according to aphasia types, place of articulation, and manner of articulation. Results VOT of the aphasic patients with peculiarities of aspiration had a greater difference than that of the controls, indicating that the temporal non-coordination between the laryngeal adjustment and oral articulators of aphasic patients happens due to the VOT of stops in the initial and intervocalic positions (p&lt;0.05). Conclusion VOT of stop consonants in the initial position produced by aphasic patients tends to be proportional to their breathing. It can cause glottal width and make aphasic patients&apos; VOT duration longer. Lastly, the method to measure the VOT of aphasic patients is more significant for the types of phonation than for the places of articulation, and makes it possible to induce abnormal VOT.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>Aphasia is a partial or general disorder of recognition systems and other communication mechanisms, which are the basis of language patterns and language itself, and which is due to damage to the speech portion of the central nervous system, and it is often defined as the neurological disability to understand or form language. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> Also, the language disorder of aphasic patients can be categorized in two ways: typological, in which one or more aspects of language understanding, where the output of aphasia patients is invaded, and non-typolo gical, in which all other aspects of language underwww.e-arm.org standing and output have been damaged. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> How ever, there can be some cases where this defi nition might not be limited to language and the cognitive process or the domain of language. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> Generally, a language disorder from cerebral damage is termed 'aphasia' and a speech sound disorder is termed 'dysarthria' . For several decades, cerebral neurologists, psychologists, and linguists have studied mainly aphasia lan guage disorder. Recent advances phonology and sound analysis equipment have enabled the study of dysar thria, which occurs when aphasia patients speak. In the phonological field, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> phonological codes or damage to work memory have been intensively studied, while the voice onset time (VOT) of aphasic patients and the length of vowels and syllables have been studied and compared with a control group in the fi eld of acoustics. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> The study of temporal abnormalities, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> especially those related to VOT and the length of syllables of aphasic patients, has contributed to the study of damage to language or word exercise plans, or the apraxia func tion, and the evaluative study of time coordination 7 bet ween larynx and oral articulating organs. It also has emphasized the importance of articulation places and the output of the voiced and voiceless consonants of stop con sonants. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> Such studies make it possible to expand the range of interpretation for the speech evaluation of apha sia patients, and VOT studies can be understood as extensive, involving speech exercise plans and apraxia function. VOT has been used as a phonological clue or index for the study of interaction between articulating exercises and laryngeal adjustment. Th us, this study aimed to address the hypothesis that, in the Korean language, the phonological characteristics of consonants rather than those of vowels are more focused because the VOT shows the degree of aspiration better in the beginning of the speech when the stop sounds are articulated, and is used as a main measure in light of the fact that it can show phonological diff erence according to the places of consonants and the types of phonation. Also, to analyze whether there is any difference in phonetic processes according to articulation places phonologically, the output of voiced and voiceless consonants was analyzed according to the articulation sites, and the sound spectral time of the phonetic environment was compared and evaluated, to be used as the baseline data for the evaluation and diagnosis of aphasic patients.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study subjects</head><p>Subjects were 15 aphasic patients (nine males and six  <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">(Table 1)</ref>. When evaluated, they had no sensitivity problems and were right-handers before they were diagnosed. Subjects of the control group were similar to the patients in their age (47.4±8.24), sex, dialects, and right-handedness. Th ey had no problems with their hearing and language use, and did not have any anatomical drug problems either.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Evaluation of aphasia:</head><p>To evaluate their aphasia, the Chonbuk National University Aphasia Battery (CNUAB) was used. The battery is comprised of three test kits: Japanese Standard Language Test of Aphasia, 9 the Minnesota Test for Differential Diagnosis of Aphasia, 10 and the Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref>  <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> shows the test scores for the language evaluation of the experimental group.</p><p>Acoustic evaluation: Evaluation of the articulation disorder of the aphasia patients was done using the words of the VPI Articulation Differential Examination kit, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> with single-or multi-syllable words made up of CV (con sonant vowel) or CVC (C: stop sound) types, which have meaning <ref type="table">(Table 3)</ref>. As subjects of the experimental group could read colloquial language, they were asked to read the cards on which pictures and words were pro vided together. If they could not respond within 15 seconds, they were given oral stimulus. The voice files of the subjects were stored and analyzed using the Computerized Speech Lab Model 4500 KayPentax (Montvale, NJ, USA). The sampling rate of the voice files was 11,025 Hz, which operated at 100 points (161.50 Hz) </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">/p/ /pεc h u/ /p h / / p h oto/ /p'/ /p'ul/ /t/ /twεci/ /t h / / t h aco/ /t'/ /t'alki/ /k/ /kεkuli/ /k h / / k h ok'ili/ /k'/ /k'ac h i/ Aff ricatives /c/ /cepi/ /c h / / c h itsol/ /c'/ /c'akc'aki/</formula><p>VOT: Voice onset time</p><p>www.e-arm.org above the Nyquest Frequency. Th e VOT was analyzed on the broadband spectrum.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical analyses</head><p>For statistical analysis, SPSS version 14.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA) was used to discriminate the signifi cance using one-way ANOVA analysis independent samples, t-test mean comparison on the voiced and voiceless according to the places of articulation, types of phonation, and the places of articulation in the intervocalic VCV combinations. To verify the identity of the variance of the two groups, it was statistically analyzed by f value. Th e quantitative evaluation of the VOT category was done based on the previous research methods which used the comparison of mean diff erence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Comparison of VOT difference ac cording to types of aphasic patients</head><p>After testing the aphasic patients, differential and variance analyses of the results were done and compared with the results of the control group. In the differential analysis of the VOT length according to aphasia types, the length of the VOT was the shortest in ano mic aphasic patients (49.04 ms) and there was no significant difference with the control group, yet all the other patients revealed significant differences (p&lt;0.05).</p><p>In addition, the length of the VOT and vowels of the experimental group were longer compared with the results of the control group, which was consistent with the results of the previous study. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Comparison of VOT diff erences ac cording to the places of articulation and types of phonation</head><p>Based on the study results show that VOT closely related with aspiration degree and that this is related to the length of the VOT, we compared the VOT diff erence with aphasic patients who displayed aspiration according to the articulation places and phonation types. While the vocal cords remained distant during the lead time, aphasic patients revealed diff erences in phonation types <ref type="table">(Table 4</ref>) rather than in articulation sites ( <ref type="table">Table 5</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Phenomenon of voicing in the VCV (Vowel, Voiceless consonant) combination</head><p>To observe voicing phenomenon, the voicing errors and voice lead times of aphasic patients with pronounced aspiration were analyzed. When they were analyzed on the spectrogram with four voiced words (/kεkuli/, /p h oto/, /t h aco/, /cepi/) according to the articulation places, only the bilabial sounds showed significant differences (p&lt;0.05) and the lead time was long ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1-A , 1-B</ref>) in diff erential analysis with the control group <ref type="table">(Table 5</ref>). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>VOT comparison ac cording to the types of phonation VOT had a close relationship with the degrees of aspiration or glottal width, and all types of aphasic patients revealed significant differences in VOT compared with the control group <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">(Table 6)</ref>. Also, the length of VOT was related with the aspiration, as evidenced by significant diff erences articulating the aspirated normal sound and aspiration <ref type="table">(Table 4)</ref>. In other words, the noise interval can be understood as a voice lag until the vowel formant is observed after the vertical spike on the spectrogram, which is observed due to the opening of the stop sound that is located at the word-initial. In addition, the fi nding that the length of the VOT of aphasic patients was longer than that of the normal control group indicated that the sound timing could vary relating to the lead time between abnormal or vocal abduction and oral plosive, owing to non-coordination between larynx and oral articulating organs, due to the turbulence which is formed at larynx. 14 Th ese results are likely attributable to an inelastic stiff ness of the larynx and the loss of exercise due to the damage to the central nervous system and cranial nerves, 15 so the VOT differences arise according to the degree of damage to the interaction between the tongue, pharynx, and larynx, which are related with stop sounds.</p><p>As word-initial stop sounds come out as either white or short noise intervals on the spectrogram, owing to a lack of energy because of their articulating characteristics, there could not be any information found to notify the articulating places. However, according to the VOT length, types of phonation can be categorized into normal, aspirated, or fortis sounds. One thing that could be understood is that there was a difference according to the degrees of VOT aspiration at word-initial of aphasic patients <ref type="table">(Table 4</ref>, <ref type="figure">Fig. 2-A)</ref>, confi rming that the phonation type analysis of the VOT of aphasic patients with more degrees of aspiration is more signifi cant than that of the articulating sites.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Output of voiced • voiceless consonants</head><p>The experimental group was asked to speak normal Korean sounds that consisted of phonologically conso-  www.e-arm.org nants. When the 15 patients of the experimental group were asked to speak four VCV words, each to find out the articulating positions, 58% (35/60) of the words were uttered as consonants, and bilabial and velar sounds showed differences with the control group in lead time ( <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 7)</ref>.</p><p>According to a prior study <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> on the phonological aspects, some studies have indicated that words uttered as voiced or voiceless depend on the speaker's phonation speed or phonological environment, but in the case of aphasic patients they showed diff erent results from those of the control group in voicing errors and the lead time of intervocalic VCV. However, sometimes lead time and the vowel length before the consonant stop sound are often measured and compared because it is not always true that all aphasic patients make voicing errors. As seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1-A and 1-B</ref>, the c interval was long as the lead time in aphasic patients and the vowel length is also shown long, consistent with previous studies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> Some studies have assumed that the output diff erence of voiced • unvo iced consonants of aphasic patients are the interaction between the muscles of arytenoids cartilage and posterior cricoarytenoid cartilage, which are known to control the distinction of the voiced and voiceless consonants. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> Although the normal sound of VCV has a small amount of aspiration, the vocal cord's vibration interval (d) in aphasic patients turns out long, which means that there could be a temporal non-coordination between the larynx and the oral articulating organs, not only at the word-initial, but also at the intervocalic VCV. Th is should be examined more widely in more subjects.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Critical points</head><p>The critical points of this paper are as follows: the expe rimental group was not large enough, subjects were locally concentrated, and the evaluation tools for the aphasic patients used for this study have not yet been recognized offi cially as the standard.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSION</head><p>This study was performed to find out the temporal abnor malities of aphasic patients.
