<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</head><p>This study was performed for two months, from March 19, 2013, to May 29, 2013, at 13 general hospitals located in Seoul and Gyeonggi province, Republic of Korea. Patients over 20 year old and registered as having type 2 diabetes, excluding those with type 1 diabetes and those who were unfit on the day they were diagnosed, were invited to participate. Based on these criteria, there were 2,626 possible participants who had visited outpatient clinics and received medical care for 6 months. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of each participant's hospital. In this study, we surveyed the management of the 1,263 type 2 diabetic patients of 13 general hospitals in the Republic of Korea according to the American Diabetes Association (ADA) guidelines <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8)</ref> .</p><p>Using medical records, we investigated socio-economic data, disease-related data, blood sampling tests, prescription drugs, co-morbidities and complications. We developed and used a questionnaire based on previous study. BMI was calculated as weight (kg) divided by height (m) squared. To understand the management, we checked the results of angiography and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), serum lipid, fasting blood sugar, 2-hour postprandial glucose, and microalbuminuria test which are the indexes for blood sugar management. We also investigated behavioral treatment, oral hypoglycemic agents, insulin, insulin with an oral hypoglycemic agent and insulin pumps in the case of diabetes treatment. For comorbid medication, we investigated hypertension drugs, anticoagulation agents and anti-lipidemic agents. We investigated the 1 year results, and if there were no records or the records were one or more years old, the patient was considered to have had no check-up. For the appropriate metabolic control level, we checked the blood sugar level, blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) &lt; 100 mg/dL, high-density lipoprotein, and serum lipid level. We followed the target standards of the ADA which were the HbA1c &lt; 7.0%, blood pressure &lt; 130/80 mmHg, cholesterol (HDL-C) &gt; 40 mg/dL (male) or 55 mg/ dL (female), and triglyceride &lt; 150 mg/dL <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8)</ref> . Regarding complications, we included only those diagnosed based on the patients' medical records. For complications, we counted cases in which patients had related drug prescriptions even if there was no diagnosis and cases in which there were diseases diagnosed based on the patients' medical records. If the patients had received education at other institutions, the education was excluded because of lack of clear records and quality control. When patients were medicated with hypertension-and dyslipidemia-related drugs, we whether or not there were medical records. All cancers were included.</p><p>All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS for Windows (v. 12.0 K, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The results were expressed as the mean ± standard deviation (SD) and number (percent). The general and clinical characteristics of the patients in the exercise and non-exercise groups, including age, height, weight, and others results, were analyzed with the independent t-test. Differences were considered statistically significant when p &lt; 0.05. Pearson's correlation coefficients were used to assess the relation between metabolic regulation (blood pressure, glucose, HbA1c, total cholesterol, triglyceride, and HDL and LDL cholesterol) and exercise in patients with type 2 diabetes. Moreover, univariate logistic regression was used to assess the associations between achievement of goals for metabolic regulation of medical characteristics and complications and exercise in patients with type 2 diabetes. The odds ratios for each factor in each model were calculated with Wald-type 95% confidence intervals.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head><p>Characteristics of the study population were analyzed <ref type="table">(Table 1)</ref>. Among the 1,263 diabetic participants, 734 routinely performed exercise for management of diabetes. The baseline characteristics of the participants revealed an average age of 60.6 years with a slightly higher proportion of males (58.1%) than females (41.9%). There were no significant differences in height (163.5±8.6 cm vs. 162.5±9.7 cm), weight (66.6±11.0 kg vs. 67.6±11.9 kg), and duration of diabetes (10.4±8.0 years vs. 10.5±8.5 years) between the exercise and non-exercise groups. However, there was a significant difference in BMI (24.9±3.1 vs. 25.5±3.6) between the two groups. In the exercise group, 46.6% of the participants had hypertension, 14.9% of the participants had hyperlipidemia, 63.9% of the participants had received education concerning diabetes. In the non-exercise group, 53.5% of the participants had hypertension (53.5%), 18.3% of the participants had hyperlipidemia, and 57.5% of the participants had received education concerning diabetes.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>Type 2 diabetes mellitus is associated with changes in all organ systems involved in human health including the Odds ratios for exercise and achievement of goals for metabolic regulation in patients with type 2 diabetes were calculated by univariate logistic regression. Achievement of goals was decided based on the target standards of the ADA, which were the HbA1c &lt; 7.0%, blood pressure &lt; 130/80 mmHg, LDL-C &lt; 100 mg/dL, HDL-C &gt; 40 mg/dL (male) or 55 mg/dL (female), and triglyceride &lt; 150 mg/dL. Odds ratios for each factor in each model were calculated with Wald-type 95% confidence intervals. *p &lt; 0.05 Odds ratio for exercise and complication incidence in patients with type 2 diabetes were calculated. Univariate logistic regression was used to assess the associations between complications and exercise in type 2 diabetes. Odds ratios for each factor in each model were calculated with Wald-type 95% confidence intervals. *p &lt; 0.05 digestive, cardiovascular, renal, optic, and neural systems. For type 2 diabetes, the three major sources of therapy are adjustment of food intake, pharmacological therapy, and exercise. Among them, exercise makes up an important part of diabetes management and ameliorates the health of patients with type 2 diabetes. Therefore, the aim of present study was to investigate the current evidence for the effect of exercise on glycemic control, lipid profile, body composition, vascular health, and complications in a number of patients with type 2 diabetes to understand the apparent relations between exercise and health. Diabetes affects both body mass and muscle quality, due to poor vascular supply and peripheral neuropathy <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13)</ref> . Among the characteristics of the study population, there was a significant difference in only BMI between the exercise and non-exercise groups in the present results. The BMI value represents a highly important risk factor for type 2 diabetes, and exercise adjusts the BMI by reducing visceral fat and increasing the fat-free mass <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14)</ref> Our results showed an association between metabolic regulation variables and exercise management. Most metabolic regulation variables had associations with exercise. Exercise management was associated with a decrease in SBP, fasting glucose, postprandial glucose, HbA1c, total cholesterol, triglyceride, and LDL. Umpierre et al. demonstrated that aerobic exercise intervention improved HbA1c by 0.73% <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15)</ref> . Furthermore, it is well known that aerobic exercise enhances glycemic control, raising it to a moderate level <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5)</ref> . Endurance exercise helps to decrease LDL-C, however, it had no impact on HDL, total cholesterol, and triglycerides <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16)</ref> .</p><p>Moreover, in the present results concerning exercise and achievement of goals for metabolic regulation in patients with type 2 diabetes, significant odds ratios were observed for the effect of exercise treatment on blood pressure, fasting glucose, postprandial glucose, HbA1c, triglyceride, HDL in men, and BMI in the patients with type 2 diabetes. These results are related to the effect of exercise through the regulation of energy metabolism in type 2 diabetes. Exercise induces a change in fuel usage by working muscle from nonesterified fatty acids to a blend of nonesterified fatty acids, glucose, and muscle glycogen <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10)</ref> . During exercise, the neuroendocrine system would control fuel mobilization <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12)</ref> . These changes induce a decrease in insulin secretion and increase in glucagon, catecholamine, and cortisol secretion. Moreover, these neural and endocrine changes cause deficits in fuel availability, neural activity from the acting limb, visceral organs, and baroreceptor control of heart rate <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17)</ref> . The exercise-induced increase in glucagon evokes glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis as well as hepatic amino metabolism and fat oxidation. The decrease in insulin is essential to the full glycogenolytic response during exercise. The exercise-induced increase in endogenous glucose production is important in regulation of whole-body glucose homeostasis <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10)</ref> .</p><p>Meanwhile, in our results concerning exercise and complication incidence in patients with type 2 diabetes, exercise management was associated with decreased occurrence of cerebrovasculopathy. Previous studies reported that aerobic exercise had valuable effects on metabolic parameters such as glycemic control, fasting blood glucose level, and the lipid profile, and decreased the risk factors in type 2 diabetes <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2)</ref> . It also improved endothelial function and vascular complications by reducing arterial stiffness <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18)</ref> .</p><p>The present study demonstrated that exercise was associated with metabolic regulation of glycemic control, the lipid profile, and body composition, as well as vascular health and complications, in 1,263 Korean patients with type 2 diabetes. These results from this large-scale study could explain the apparent relations between exercise and diabetic health. Therefore, these facts imply that exercise leads to a more healthy life and reduces disorders and complications in patients with type 2 diabetes. More research related to the importance of exercise in terms of its various beneficial aspects is needed for people with type 2 diabetes in other countries.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0"><head>Table 1 .Table 3 .</head><label>13</label><figDesc>General and clinical characteristics of the patients in the exercise and non-exercise groups Odds ratio for exercise and achievement of goals for metabolic regulation in patients with type 2 diabetes</figDesc><table><row><cell>Variable</cell><cell>Total</cell><cell>Exercise</cell><cell>Non-exercise</cell><cell>Variable</cell><cell>Goal</cell><cell>Exercise</cell><cell>Non-exer-cise</cell><cell>Odds ratio</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>Mean±SD</cell><cell>Mean±SD</cell><cell>Mean±SD</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>Achieve-</cell><cell>Achieve-</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>N</cell><cell>1,263</cell><cell>734</cell><cell>529</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>ment (%)</cell><cell>ment (%)</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Age (yr)</cell><cell>60.6±11.6</cell><cell>60.4±11.0</cell><cell>60.9±12.5</cell><cell>Blood pressure</cell><cell cols="2">&lt;130/80 384 (52.3)</cell><cell>242 (45.7)</cell><cell>1.3*</cell></row><row><cell>Height (cm)</cell><cell>163.1±9.1</cell><cell>163.5±8.6</cell><cell>162.5±9.7</cell><cell>Fasting glucose</cell><cell>&lt;130</cell><cell>372 (53.1)</cell><cell>222 (42.0)</cell><cell>1.3*</cell></row><row><cell>Weight (kg)</cell><cell>67.0±11.4</cell><cell>66.6±11.0</cell><cell>67.6±11.9</cell><cell>Postprandial</cell><cell>&lt;180</cell><cell>299 (40.7)</cell><cell>158 (29.9)</cell><cell>1.5*</cell></row><row><cell>BMI (kg/m 2 )</cell><cell>25.1±3.3*</cell><cell>24.9±3.1</cell><cell>25.5±3.6</cell><cell>glucose</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Onset (yr)</cell><cell>50.1±11.1</cell><cell>50.0±10.6</cell><cell>50.4±11.9</cell><cell>HbA1c</cell><cell>&lt;7.0</cell><cell>371 (50.5)</cell><cell>214 (40.5)</cell><cell>1.5*</cell></row><row><cell>Duration of diabetes (yr)</cell><cell>10.5±8.3</cell><cell>10.4±8.0</cell><cell>10.5±8.5</cell><cell>Total cholesterol</cell><cell>&lt;6.5 &lt;200</cell><cell>199 (27.1) 597 (81.3)</cell><cell>114 (21.6) 394 (74.5)</cell><cell>1.3* 1.3</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>N (%)</cell><cell>N (%)</cell><cell>Triglyceride</cell><cell>&lt;150</cell><cell>518 (70.6)</cell><cell>288 (54.4)</cell><cell>2.0*</cell></row><row><cell>Gender</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>HDL</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Male</cell><cell>734 (58.1)</cell><cell>440 (59.9)</cell><cell>294 (55.6)</cell><cell>Men</cell><cell>&gt;40</cell><cell>295 (67.0)</cell><cell>163 (55.4)</cell><cell>1.3*</cell></row><row><cell>Female</cell><cell>529 (41.9)</cell><cell>294 (40.1)</cell><cell>235 (44.4)</cell><cell>Women</cell><cell>&gt;50</cell><cell>138 (46.9)</cell><cell>104 (44.3)</cell><cell>1.3</cell></row><row><cell>Hypertension</cell><cell cols="2">625 (49.5)* 342 (46.6)</cell><cell>283 (53.5)</cell><cell>LDL</cell><cell>&lt;100</cell><cell>399 (54.4)</cell><cell>274 (51.8)</cell><cell>1.2</cell></row><row><cell>Hyperlipidemia</cell><cell>206 (16.3)</cell><cell>109 (14.9)</cell><cell>97 (18.3)</cell><cell>BMI</cell><cell cols="2">18.5-24.9 383 (52.2)</cell><cell>241 (45.6)</cell><cell>1.3*</cell></row><row><cell>Therapy of diabetes</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Diet</cell><cell>48 (3.8)</cell><cell>24 (3.3)</cell><cell>24 (4.5)</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Oral agent</cell><cell>895 (70.9)</cell><cell>528 (71.9)</cell><cell>367 (69.4)</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Oral agent+inulin</cell><cell>236 (18.7)</cell><cell>137 (18.7)</cell><cell>99 (18.7)</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Insulin</cell><cell>78 (6.2)</cell><cell>43 (5.8)</cell><cell>35 (6.6)</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell cols="2">Education experience 773 (61.2)*</cell><cell>469 (63.9)</cell><cell>304 (57.5)</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell cols="4">Characteristics of the study population were investigated us-</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell cols="4">ing medical records including disease-related data and data for</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell cols="4">blood sampling tests, prescription drugs, comorbidities, and</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell cols="4">complications.
