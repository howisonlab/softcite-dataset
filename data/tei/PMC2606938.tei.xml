				<p>Epithelia transport solutes and water between body compartments and external surfaces, using both transcellular and paracellular routes. Paracellular ion transport is believed to occur through pores in the tight junction (for review see Reuss, 2001). These pores are now known to be formed by four-transmembrane domain proteins known as claudins (Tsukita and Furuse, 2000 ; Van Itallie and Anderson, 2006). In channels that mediate transcellular transport, ions move perpendicular to the plane of the cell membrane, traversing the low-dielectric environment at the interior of the lipid bilayer, with stabilization and selectivity conferred by the transmembrane domains of the pore protein. Paracellular ion permeation through claudins is likely to be quite different because ions move parallel to and extracellular to the plane of the lipid bilayer (Fig. 1). This pathway is potentially highly hydrated and lined predominantly by the extracellular domains of claudins. The permeability properties of the native paracellular pathway have been carefully characterized in leaky epithelia, such as rabbit gallbladder (Barry et al., 1971 ; Wright et al., 1971) and cultured kidney tubule cell lines (Cereijido et al., 1978). However, the degree to which claudin-based pores exhibit ion selectivity and the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. Attempts to measure claudin permeability quantitatively in an overexpression system have been hampered Correspondence to Alan S.L. Yu: a l a n y u @ u s c. e d u Abbreviations used in this paper: DMC, dynamic Monte Carlo; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; TM, triple mutant; WT, wild-type. by the fact that many claudins behave predominantly as barriers rather than pores. Those that do increase permeability mostly increase it modestly above background, and such results are confounded by the contribution of background permeability due to endogenous claudins that are present in all epithelial cells (</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In previous studies, we subtracted from the voltage measurements performed on cell monolayer voltages measured under identical conditions using blank fi lters, in an attempt to correct for liquid junction potentials at the pipette tips. This is a widely used technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">( Van Itallie et al., 2001 ;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Yu et al., 2003 ;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Hou et al., 2008 )</ref>. However, we now realize that this is inaccurate because there is also a liquid junction potential across the fi lter itself when it is blank, but not when cells are cultured on it. Therefore, to deduce the pipette potentials, we had to correct for this blank fi lter junction potential. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2</ref> A shows the Ussing chamber setup with a blank fi lter.

The osmolality was balanced using mannitol. For alkali metal biionic potentials, one hemichamber was switched to a solution containing 150 mM of the alkali metal cation chloride salt. For organic cation diffusion potentials, we used a solution containing 75 mM of the organic cation chloride salt and 75 mM NaCl. Ion permeability ratios were deduced from the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz voltage equation.

The activity coeffi cients used for NaCl at 150 and 75 mM were 0.752 and 0.797, respectively.

Viral supernatant was then used to infect MDCK I TetOff cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">( Angelow et al., 2007b )</ref> in the presence of polybrene, and stable clones were selected using cloning cylinders. High-throughput screening of clones was performed by seeding them into optical glass-bottomed 96-well culture plates (Thermo Fisher Scientifi c) in the presence (Dox+) or absence (Dox Ϫ ) of 20 ng/ml doxycycline, immunostaining them with claudin-2 antibody (Invitrogen), and identifying positive clones by fl uorescence microscopy. Double labeling with anti-ZO1 (Invitrogen) was used to confi rm correct localization of claudin-2 to the tight junction. Claudin-2 protein expression was confi rmed by immunoblotting. An infrared fl uorescence secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 680) was used so that blots could be scanned with an infrared detection system (Li-Cor Odyssey) and the bands digitally quantitated. The effect of claudin-2 on expression of endogenous tight junction proteins was assessed by immunoblotting with antibodies to claudins 1, 3, 4, and 7 (Invitrogen).</p><p>For freeze-fracture electron microscopy, confl uent monolayers were fi xed in 2% glutaraldehyde at 4 ° C for 30 min and processed as described previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">( Yu et al., 2003 )</ref>. To quantify the number of parallel strands in the tight junctions, electron micrographs were overlayed with a transparency marked with gridlines, and the number of strands crossing each line was counted. The difference in the median number of strands between Dox+ and Dox Ϫ cells was compared using the Wilcoxon ranked-sum test.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ussing Chamber Electrophysiological Studies</head><p>Our methods are identical to those described previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">( Yu et al., 2003 ;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Angelow et al., 2006 )</ref>, with the exception that we have modifi ed the way we correct for liquid junction potentials (vide infra). Cells were plated at confl uent density on Snapwell fi lters (Corning) and cultured for 8 d, which we fi nd is suffi cient to achieve steady-state transepithelial resistance and maximal induction of expression in the TetOff system. The fi lters were mounted in Ussing chambers stirred with gas lifts in 100% O 2 at 37 ° C, and voltage/ current clamped using Ag/AgCl electrodes bridged by 3 M KCl/3% agar pipettes. The standard Ringer solution used at baseline contained (in mM): 150 NaCl, 2 CaCl 2 , 1 MgCl 2 , 10 glucose, and 10 Tris-HEPES, pH 7.4. In general, data were acquired at 1-s intervals using Acquire and Analyze software (Physiological Instruments). Conductance and voltage measurements for each condition were derived by averaging 5 -10 s worth of data (depending on stability) and reported as a single measurement for each monolayer. Comparison of the different transepithelial transport routes. Transcellular/transmembrane channels (left) mediate ion transport (arrow) perpendicular to the plane of the lipid bilayer (gray), with the pore wall formed predominantly by intramembrane domains of the channel polypeptide (orange). Paracellular pores such as claudins (right) mediate transport parallel to and extracellular to the lipid bilayer, with the pore walls presumably constituted by the extracellular domains of claudin polypeptides.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conductance Scanning</head><p>The relative conductance of trans-and paracellular pathways in the claudin-2 -expressing cells was determined by high-resolution conductance scanning of cell monolayers in horizontal Ussing chambers, as described previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">( Gitter et al., 1997 )</ref>. An alternating current (24 Hz, 20 μ A) was passed across the epithelium, and the electric fi eld generated in the apical bath solution was measured with a pair of microelectrodes (vertical tip distance, 30 -80 μ m) held above the epithelial surface. With the electric fi eld measured and the specifi c resistivity of the solution, the local current density was calculated. This and the transepithelial voltage yielded the local conductance, which was measured in the center of the cell body and at the lateral border directly over the tight junction.</p></div>

In brief, cells were bathed in DMEM with 5% FBS (Ca 2+ concentration of 1.8 mM). Trace 45 CaCl was added to the apical compartment to achieve a specifi c activity of &gt; 50 Ci/mol. At 0.5-, 1-, and 2-h intervals (during which transport was linear), 100 μ l of solution was withdrawn from the basolateral compartment for scintillation counting.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical Analysis</head><p>Where permeability or conductance of claudin-2 is reported, we took measurements obtained in Dox+ cells and subtracted them from the values in Dox Ϫ cells studied in parallel. Values are reported as mean ± SE of measurements performed on three monolayers for each condition, unless otherwise specifi ed, and are representative of at least two independent experiments. Differences between the means of continuously distributed variables were assessed by the two-tailed unpaired t test, or one-way ANOVA with Tukey ' s correction for multiple comparisons, as appropriate.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Brownian Dynamics Simulation</head><p>Given the lack of structural detail available for this channel, we built our model of claudin-2 in rough analogy to cation-selective ligand-gated ion channels (e.g., nicotinic acetylcholine receptors), based on the following points of similarity: (1) minimum pore radius; (2) cation selectivity; and (3) channel pore constriction at the location of critical charged groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">( Imoto et al., 1988 )</ref>, which helps to confer cation selectivity, inter alia. The rationale for designing our model channel is to qualitatively support the experimental electrophysiology studies reported in this work.</p><p>For biionic potentials in which the basolateral chamber was exchanged from 150 mM NaCl to 150 mM M + Cl Ϫ (where M + is another inorganic or organic cation),</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">V</formula><formula xml:id="formula_8">RT F 1n , = + + ae è ç ö ø ÷ g b b 1<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where ␥ = P M /P Na .

For the sake of simplicity, the sole source of friction was assumed to be hydrodynamic drag, which, according to the Stokes-Einstein relationship, is proportional to d <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">( Dwyer et al., 1980 )</ref>. Thus, the apparent permeability of each organic cation, P , was fi t by nonlinear regression to the equation,</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">P A d d D , 2 = - ae è ç ö ø ÷ 1 (7)</formula><p>where A is a composite constant refl ecting both intrinsic pore properties and the number of pores. Organic cation diameters were derived from empirical data by Hille using Corey-Pauling-Koltum space-fi lling molecular models <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">( Dwyer et al., 1980 )</ref>. For studies of acidifi cation, concentrated HCl was added to one or both hemichambers (in most studies to achieve a fi nal pH of 4), and conductance was monitored at 1-s intervals. The rate of change of conductance was fi tted to a single exponential curve. The titration curve of conductance, G, at different pH was fi t to a Hill equation,</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">G G K H K H a n a n = + é ë ù û + é ë ù û ì í ï î ï ü ý ï þ ï + + max , a<label>(8)</label></formula><p>where G max is the maximum conductance, and ␣ is a proportionality constant. Values for the equilibrium constant, K a , and the Hill coeffi cient, n , were then estimated.</p><p>In studies of temperature dependence, the temperature in the Ussing chamber was directly monitored by immersion of a metal thermocouple probe, and the water bath was adjusted to achieve target solution temperatures in the range of 16 to 37 ° C. Data for each monolayer was then fi tted by nonlinear regression to the Arrhenius equation to obtain an individual best-fi t estimate of the activation energy <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">( Yu et al., 2003 ;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Angelow et al., 2006 )</ref>. Ussing chamber setup and method of correcting for junction potentials. The sign of the potential is indicated by the arrows, which show the potential of the arrow head with respect to the arrow tail. Liquid junction potentials in the agar bridge pipettes (V L a and V L b ) are calculated as the potential of the solution with respect to the pipette.

The second term represents the dielectric self-energy or the image potential due to the charged ion k . The third term calculates Coulombic interactions between pairs of ions in a dielectrically uniform environment characterized by the water dielectric constant w , and the fourth term corresponds to the image potential experienced by ion k due to the surface charge induced by ion j . These two terms account for the ion -ion interaction in a dielectric-inhomogeneous medium. The fi fth term corresponds to Coulombic interactions between residue D65 and the chosen ion k in a dielectrically uniform environment, and the sixth term contributes to the image potential experienced by ion k due to the surface charge induced by residue D65. These two terms together estimate the Coulombic interactions between ion and the charged residue D65. The effects of the dielectric inhomogeneity of the channel environment on the ion -ion and ion -D65 electrostatic interactions (the fourth and sixth terms in Eq. 10) were implemented using an effi cient empirical pair potential <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Cheng et al., 2007 )</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">f f f kj diel k k diel j j diel kj cr L = - ¬ ¬ 2 e x p ( / ) ,<label>(11)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">f k k diel ¬</formula><p>and f j j diel ¬ are the dielectric contribution to the self-energy (or the image potential) for ions k and j with a unit (proton) charge. f kD diel was also calculated using Eq. 11, with f D D diel ¬ taken to be the image potential near the pore surface. A detailed description for calculating f k k diel ¬ can be found in  . L is the length of the channel, and r kj is the distance between the ions k and j , and c = 2.0. Finally, the last term in Eq. 10 is included to account for the effect of the nonuniform ion diffusion constant profi le, which in the model considered in this study varies only along the channel direction. The diffusion constants and the associated ion displacements taken in one DMC step obeyed the relation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">h z D z h D k k k k ( ) / ( ) / , 2 0 2 0 =<label>(12)</label></formula><p>where h z k ( ) and h k 0 are the associated ion displacement at position z and bulk solution for ion k , respectively. To synchronize time between the mobile ions, the ion displacement in the bulk for different cations was related to that of chloride ion as follows:</p><p>In our Brownian dynamics simulations, claudin-2 was modeled as a cylindrical pore with a diameter of 6.5 Å , based on our experimental estimates <ref type="figure">( Fig. 7 B )</ref>. The pore was assumed to have a length of 10 Å , connected to two cone-like vestibules on either side, which represent the entrances to the pore and are in contact with the extracellular solution ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 11 A )</ref> (see Online Supplemental Material II for details of our simulations, including the channel geometry; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. S4</ref>; both are available at http://www.jgp .org/cgi/content/full/jgp.200810154/DC1). The widest part of these vestibules was assumed to be 7.6 Å in radius, and the entire length of the paracellular pore was assumed to be 32 Å . For simplicity, the dielectric constant inside the aqueous pore was assumed to be the same as that in the bulk solution <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">( Graf et al., 2000</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">( Graf et al., , 2004</ref>, with w = 80, and the cell/claudin-2 was characterized by a uniform effective dielectric constant, p = 20, which falls within the range of previously adopted protein dielectric constant <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">( Smith et al., 1993 ;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Simonson and Brooks, 1996 ;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Pitera et al., 2001</ref> ). For transmembrane ion channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">( Corry et al., 2001 ;</ref>, a comparatively smaller p (i.e., p = 2 -5) is usually used to account for the low dielectric constant in the interior of lipids (i.e., = 2) <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">( Pethig, 1979 )</ref>. For a paracellular pore, we anticipate a larger effective dielectric constant should be used for p because the pore is formed by the extracellular protein (i.e., p = 10 -40) and the dipole layer <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">( Andersen and Fuchs, 1975 )</ref> formed by the lipid head groups may contribute to an increase in the effective dielectric constant for the cell. D65 was treated explicitly as a negatively charged spherical particle to mimic the carboxylate moiety of this residue, which is characterized by its size R D , charge q D , and the distance between the channel centerline and the sphere center R C , and located in the middle of the pore. The particle description of D65 allowed us to preserve some molecular-level properties of the D65 residue. All other charged residues (E53, D76, R30, and K48) in the fi rst extracellular domain were treated as point charges, and the calculation of electrostatic potential due to these charges was performed by solving Poisson ' s equation. Claudins are multimeric and have been proposed to form hexamers <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">( Mitic et al., 2003 )</ref>; therefore, residue point charges and D65 particles were inserted six times, 60 ° apart. The effective charges were assumed to be 0.2 e and Ϫ 0.2 e for positive and negative point charges, respectively. For simplicity, the positive charges were assumed to face away from the channel and be separated from their neighboring negative charges by 2.5 Å in the radial direction (perpendicular to the channel axis; compare <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 11 A )</ref>.</p><p>We used a dynamic Monte Carlo (DMC) method to simulate ion permeation through the claudin-2 paracellular pore.

(Note that using an internal diffusion constant of roughly half the bulk diffusion constant of permeant Na + and Cl Ϫ ions in two independent Brownian dynamics simulations of ion fl ow through the glycine receptor, which has a pore diameter of approximately 6 Å , yielded conductance values in reasonable agreement with experiments <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[ O ' Mara et al., 2003 ;</ref>.

The apparently linear conductance -concentration relationship makes it unlikely that a surface charge effect is the cause of the Na + selectivity.</p><p>What is the basis for the cation selectivity of claudin-2? To investigate the interaction between permeating cations and the claudin-2 pore, we determined the permeability of claudin-2 to other alkali metal cations using biionic potentials ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 7 A and</ref>  <ref type="table">Table I</ref> ). The permeability sequence was found to be: K + &gt; Rb + &gt; Na + &gt; Li + &gt; &gt; Cs + . This sequence is quite different from the sequence of their free-solution mobilities and resembles Eisenman selectivity sequence V -VIII. This suggests that permeating cations have to dehydrate to enter the claudin-2 pore, and that there must be a moderately high fi eld strength, negatively charged interaction site within the pore that stabilizes the dehydrated cation <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">( Diamond and Wright, 1969 ;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Eisenman and Horn, 1983 )</ref>. This would also explain the high selectivity for cations over anions. However, the ratio between the permeabilities of the most permeable cation (K + ) and the least permeable (Cs + ) was 1.6, which is quite narrow and suggests that the interaction site is partially hydrated. To assess the size of the claudin-2 ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 6 )</ref>, consistent with the idea that the increase in conductance occurs through claudin-2 pores.</p><p>To determine the relative and absolute permeability to Na + and Cl Ϫ , NaCl dilution potentials were measured <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">( Fig. 4 B )</ref>. Dilution potentials determined at different apical/basolateral NaCl activity ratios fi t well to a Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">( Fig. 4 C )</ref>. We therefore used 150 mM NaCl/75 mM NaCl dilution potentials and the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation to derive relative permeabilities for Na + and Cl Ϫ . <ref type="table">Table I</ref> lists the raw data, which is summarized in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 4</ref> D . Induction of claudin-2 increased P Na by ‫ف‬ 10-fold compared with control Dox+ cells; P Cl was increased approximately fourfold. By subtracting the conductance and permeability in Dox+ cells from that in Dox Ϫ cells, we derived the increase in transepithelial conductance and permeability attributable to the introduction of claudin-2 -based paracellular pores <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">( Fig. 4 E )</ref>. We therefore have a quantitative measure of the macroscopic conductance and permeability of a claudin-based pore. By this method, the permeability of claudin-2 to Na + was determined to be 7.5 ± 0.9 times its permeability to Cl Ϫ . Thus, claudin-2 forms cation-selective pores. Furthermore, these pores appear to be nonrectifying and exhibit a fairly linear relationship between conductance and Na + concentrations The transepithelial diffusion potential, V TE , was determined at different NaCl activity ratios (apical activity/ basolateral activity) and plotted on a log-linear scale. Data were fi t by nonlinear regression to the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation with best-fi t values (95% CI) for P Na /P Cl of 1.5 (1.4 -1.6) for Dox+ and 6.3 (5.7 -6.8) for Dox Ϫ .

When the pH of the extracellular fl uid was lowered, claudin-2 conductance fell promptly, at a rate (time constant 8.2 ± 0.02 s) similar to that of solution mixing in our Ussing chambers, suggesting a diffusion-limited process <ref type="figure">( Fig. 7 C )</ref>. Moreover, pore, its permeability to three organic cations, methylamine, ethylamine, and tetramethylammonium, was determined and fi t to a Renkin equation ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 7 B</ref> and <ref type="table">Table II</ref> ). The pore diameter estimated by nonlinear regression was 6.5 ± 0.3 Å . This is smaller than the diameter of a hydrated Na + ion, 7.2 Å <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">( Nightingale, 1959 )</ref>, so that Na + would likely have to shed at least part of its hydration shell to permeate through the claudin-2  tivity to show convincingly that the fi rst extracellular domain of claudins lines the paracellular pore <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">( Colegio et al., 2002</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">( Colegio et al., , 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Van Itallie et al., 2003 )</ref>. However, it is unclear whether these mutants also inform on the location of the ion selectivity fi lter or merely refl ect artificially created electrostatic fi elds within the pore that affect ion permeation. Indeed, the fact that mutations of most charged residues in the fi rst extracellular domain have a similar effect would suggest the latter. There are three acidic residues in the fi rst extracellular loop of claudin-2: E53, D65, and D76. To test the hypothesis that one or more of these might be responsible for the negatively charged cation-interaction site in the claudin-2 pore, we mutated each of these to its neutral, polar counterpart (E53Q, D65N, and D76N), generated a triple mutant (TM) bearing all three mutations, and generated stable, inducible MDCK I TetOff cell lines expressing each mutant. By neutralizing instead of reversing the normal charge at each site, we expect to pinpoint only those residues that are part of the normal selectivity mechanism. Clones were selected that expressed similar levels of claudin-2 protein to WT and showed good induction and suppression. Mutant cell lines exhibited similar levels of expression and subcellular localization of claudin-2 protein to the WT claudin-2 clone, and similarly had little effect on expression of endogenous claudins <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">( Fig. 8 )</ref>.</p><p>When the conductance and Na + and Cl Ϫ permeability of the mutant claudin-2 proteins were measured, E53Q and D76N were found to be very similar to WT claudin-2 (WT). However, D65N exhibited threefold lower conductance and Na + permeability, with no change in Cl Ϫ permeability, and the TM was indistinguishable from D65N <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">( Fig. 9, A and B )</ref>. Thus, D65 is required for maximum cation permeability of claudin-2. The temperature dependence of conductance and Na + permeability was measured and fi t to the Arrhenius equation to determine the activation energy of permeation (E a ). Mutation of D65 to N increased the activation energy for conductance (41.8 ± 4.3 kJ/mol vs. 39.7 ± 1.9 kJ/mol for WT) and P Na (42.7 ± 2.0 kJ/mol vs. 39.0 ± 1.4 kJ/mol for WT) <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">( Fig. 9, C and D )</ref>. The observed changes of 2 -4 kJ/mol are the right order of magnitude to account for the permeability changes (an e -fold reduction in P Na would be expected with an increase in the height of the energy barrier of 1 RT = 2.6 kJ/mol) and suggest that D65N in some way impedes the kinetics of Na + permeation, rather than reducing the number of available pores. Furthermore, the permeability pattern of organic cations and estimated pore diameter (5.8 ± 0.3 Å ) of D65N was not signifi cantly different from that of WT claudin-2 ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 7 B )</ref>, excluding steric hindrance as the explanation. Thus, the most likely explanation is that D65 forms part of the electrostatic cation interaction site.</p><p>Three independent experiments suggest that D65 is part of the negatively charged interaction site. First, we the acidifi cation-induced reduction in conductance was due predominantly to a reduction in the Na + permeability of claudin-2 ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 7 D )</ref>, with no apparent change in Cl Ϫ permeability. This suggests that acidifi cation is titrating and neutralizing fi xed net negative charge(s) at the cation interaction site. Consistent with this, the relationship between pH and conductance could be fi t to a single-site model with a Hill coeffi cient of 1.0 and a pK a of 4.9 ± 0.1, which is well within the pK a range for the side chain carboxylate groups of acidic amino acid residues <ref type="figure">( Fig. 7 E )</ref>.</p></div>

The relative permeability to Li + , P Li /P Na , was ‫ف‬ 1 for WT, E53Q, and D76N. However, D65N and TM exhibited markedly lower P Li /P Na ; their curves were completely superimposable, and the predicted selectivity sequence was K + &gt; Rb + &gt; Na + &gt; Cs + &gt; &gt; Li + (Eisenman sequence V). Li + is the smallest and hence most strongly hydrated alkali metal. In order for Li + to permeate a narrow pore such as claudin-2, the huge energy cost of dehydration must be offset by an energetically favorable interaction with a site within the pore. Inspection of Eisenman ' s sequences shows that as the fi eld strength of an electrostatic interaction site decreases, the fi rst consequence is that the relative position of Li + is progressively demoted. Thus, the relative permeability of Li + is a highly sensitive marker of the fi eld strength of an intrapore electrostatic interaction site, and its reduction in D65N and TM strongly supports the notion that the side chain of D65 is part of such a site.</p><p>Third, we showed that acidifi cation to pH 4.0 markedly reduced the conductance of E53Q and D76N to the same extent as WT, whereas D65N and TM showed much less inhibition, suggesting loss of a titratable, negatively were able to demonstrate by radiotracer fl ux assay that Ca 2+ passes through WT claudin-2 pores with a permeability approximately fourfold lower than Na + . If D65 is an electrostatic interaction site for permeating cations, one would expect abolition of the net charge to have a disproportionately large effect on the permeability of polyvalent, compared with monovalent, cations. Indeed, whereas P Na (WT)/P Na (D65N) was 2.9 ± 0.1, P Ca (WT)/ P Ca (D65N) was 22.1 ± 0.8, indicating that loss of the carboxylate side chain of D65 disproportionately inhibits Ca 2+ permeation <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">( Fig. 10 A )</ref>.</p><p>Second, we determined the alkali metal cation permeability sequence for all the mutants. E53Q and D76N exhibited high permeabilities to all the alkali metal cations, and the selectivity was identical to WT. D65N and TM, however, both showed substantially lower permeabilities to all the alkali metal cations and, more importantly, a differently shaped selectivity profi le <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">( Fig. 10 C )</ref>. To control for the large differences in overall permeability, we normalized all the values for each mutant to its P Na and plotted the relative permeabilities of each cation, X + , as P X /P Na <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">( Fig. 10 D )</ref>.

Because claudins are likely multimeric and possibly hexameric, we assumed that D65 contributed six identical partial charges. The claudin-2 pore shows no obvious current rectifi cation, so we further assumed that D65 is located in the middle of the selectivity fi lter to avoid possible current rectifi cation arising from asymmetry of the channel geometry and fi xed charge location. Referring to the (symmetric) channel geometry presented in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 11</ref> A , placing D65 5 Å away from the channel center toward the left channel entrance induced a slight current rectifi cation characterized by ␥ +40mv / ␥ Ϫ 40mv = 1.25 because more cations were attracted into the channel entrance from the left side (at +40 mV) than from the right side (at Ϫ 40 mV).</p><p>As expected, this simple model was suffi cient to reproduce the high degree of cation selectivity of the pore. This model pore exhibited P Cl /P Na of 0.07 ± 0.03 charged site <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">( Fig. 10 B )</ref>. Examination of alkali metal selectivity revealed that acidifi cation of WT claudin-2 showed a trend to reduce relative Li + permeability, consistent with titration of the negative charge on the interaction site <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">( Fig. 10 E )</ref>. Finally, when D65 was mutated to N and acidifi ed to pH 4, the magnitude of the reduction in Li + permeability was the same as with either D65N or acidifi cation alone; in other words, there was no additive effect. This is consistent with the hypothesis that the functional consequence of acidifi cation was caused by titration of the side chain carboxylate of D65.</p></div>

Neutralizing the charge on D65 (equivalent to the D65N mutation) reduced Na permeability by ‫ف‬ 2/3.

Assuming the same ion diffusivity profi les for all cations (compare <ref type="table">Table S6</ref>, model 4), the relative permeability ratio among different cations is Li &gt; Na &gt; K &gt; Rb &gt; Cs. Our results show that relatively small differences in cation radius can result in detectable differences in selectivity when the geometric features of the channel, dielectric and diffusion constants for the ions, etc., are chosen appropriately. It should be noted, however, that our simple model is unsuccessful in one respect: when the negative charge on the D65 residue is abolished, the relative permeability plot remains qualitatively similar to that shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 11</ref> D for the anionic D65 case. That is, the relative permeability of Li + does not decrease in the Brownian dynamics simulations as it does experimentally (compare <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 10 D )</ref>. This failure may be due to the highly simplifi ed rendering of the D65 residue adopted here, as noted in Discussion below. our experiments <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">( Fig. 11 C )</ref>. The model also allows us to estimate the conductance of a single claudin-2 pore over a range of Na + concentrations.

However, we fi nd that claudin-2 is narrow ( ‫ف‬ 6.5 Å diameter), and cation selective (P Na /P Cl = 7.5). There are inherent limitations in any method to estimate pore diameter. We chose to use cations as size probes because we wished to know the effective size of the pore for cation permeation. However, there are only a few small nitrogenous organic cations. Moreover, the chemical characteristics, and particularly the availability of groups for hydrogen bonding, of different nitrogenous cations are quite different. To the extent that this may affect interactions with the pore wall, their permeability is not a pure function of size. Thus, it is reassuring to fi nd that our estimate is not dissimilar from that of Van <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Itallie et al.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D I S C U S S I O N</head><p>Here, we determine the transepithelial conductance and permeability of MDCK I cells induced to express claudin-2 and subtract it from measurements done in the control, uninduced state. We suggest that this yields a quantitative measure of the macroscopic conductance and cation permeability of claudin-2 -based pores. Our reasoning is supported by three observations. First, claudin-2 induction does not alter the number of tight junction strands. Thus, claudin-2 pores are presumably inserted into existing strands, and their conductance would be expected to be additive over the background conductance. Second, claudin-2 does not substantially alter the expression of other known endogenous tight junction membrane proteins (claudins 1, 3, 4, and 7, and occludin). Thus, changes in paracellular permeability are probably not confounded by changes in endogenous tight junction proteins, although we cannot exclude the possibility that other as yet unidentifi ed endogenous claudins could be affected. We currently do not have a structural explanation of how " extra " claudin molecules can insert into existing strands without displacing endogenous tight junction proteins. Third, the conductance of overexpressed claudin-2 is very high compared with the baseline transepithelial conductance of MDCK I cells, so that the signal to noise ratio is high. site, whereas the other acidic residues in the fi rst extracellular domain, E53 and D76, are not. The role of the fi rst extracellular domain in determining charge selectivity of claudins has already been fi rmly established <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">( Colegio et al., 2002</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">( Colegio et al., , 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Van Itallie et al., 2003</ref>. However, our fi ndings differ substantially from those of James Anderson ' s group. Van Itallie, Colegio, and colleagues used analysis of the number of charged residues in WT claudins, and the effect of charge-reversing mutations to indicate that charge selectivity depends on the additive effect of all the charged residues in the second half of the fi rst extracellular loop <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">( Colegio et al., 2002 ;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Van Itallie et al., 2003 )</ref>. This would suggest a mechanism in which the general electrostatic environment within the pore determines charge selectivity, and not a discrete binding site. However, charge-reversing mutations are potentially misleading because they introduce new charges that did not exist in the native protein and therefore may refl ect artifi cially created electrostatic effects, rather than inform on the location of the normal selectivity fi lter.</p><p>Our fi ndings also differ from those of <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Hou et al (2005)</ref> . They performed charge-neutralizing mutations in claudin-16 and found fi ve acidic residues in the fi rst extracellular loop that affected cation permeability and were interspersed with other acidic residues that had no effect. Mutation of each of the fi ve functionally important residues had only a modest effect (11 -33% reduction in claudin-2 <ref type="table">( Table II )</ref>. The identity of this larger permeation pathway remains unclear.</p><p>The mechanism for the remarkable cation selectivity of claudin-2 is likely to be the presence of a negatively charged electrostatic binding site that interacts with partially dehydrated permeating cations. This is based on the fi nding that the permeability of alkali metal cations follows a high-order Eisenman sequence, and that the cation selectivity is abrogated by extracellular acidifi cation. Acidifi cation could of course be acting allosterically at a distant site to alter claudin-2 conformation and hence permeability. However, the fi nding that acidifi cation reduces P Li /P Na and changes the alkali metal selectivity to a lower-order Eisenman sequence strongly suggests that it is titrating the negatively charged binding site. The suggestion that this is an intrapore site and not a surface charge is also supported by the fi nding of a linear conductance -concentration relationship. At low Na + concentrations and hence low ionic strength, screening of any surface charges by the bulk solution is minimized and the local Na + concentration at the pore entrance would be increased <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">( Green and Andersen, 1991 )</ref>. This would be expected to result in anomalously high conductance at low Na + concentrations. Instead, we observe a linear relationship, suggesting that the negatively charged site is within the pore.</p><p>Our charge-neutralizing mutations show convincingly that D65 is an important contributor to this binding <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 12</ref>. Alignment of the amino acid sequences of the predicted fi rst extracellular domain of the known mouse claudin isoforms using Clustal-W. Acidic residues are shaded pink, and basic residues are shaded blue. Residues that align at the homologous position to amino acids 65 and 66 of claudin-2 are indicated by arrows. served cation selectivity. Interestingly, our method of modeling the intrapore charge and the permeating ions as fi xed and mobile spheres, similar to the approach by <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Eisenman (1962)</ref> , has yielded the fi rst example of a Brownian dynamics model that can distinguish clearly between the permeabilities of the different alkali metal cations. In this model, consistent with experimental suggestion of dehydrated permeating cations, different alkali metal cations are assumed to be fully dehydrated (for simplifi cation) and distinguished by their bare ion sizes and diffusivities. Ions having a smaller radius can approach the charge on D65 more closely, as well as giving it access to a larger accessible volume (entropic effects, i.e., excluded volume effect) in the selectivity fi lter. This increases the ion occupancy of the selectivity fi lter for smaller ions, and thus increases the permeability for smaller ions (see further discussion in the online supplemental material).</p><p>There are limitations to our model. Because of its simplicity it cannot simulate all aspects of claudin-2 behavior. Abolition of the charge on D65 does reduce P Na . However, our computational model differs from our experimental fi ndings in predicting that P Cl would increase and that the alkali metal cation selectivity would not change appreciably (see online supplemental material). Further refi nement of our fi rst-pass model will be necessary to account for these observations, for example, by including more molecular detail in the modeling of the D65 residue (concerning both its geometric structure and the distribution of negative charge along this structure in the case of the anion form of the residue).</p><p>Not surprisingly, given that our model contains a discrete binding site, it predicts that the conductance -concentration relationship will be saturating at suffi ciently high Na + concentrations. This is a testable prediction that would presumably distinguish it from a model in which multiple pore charges contribute to a diffuse electrostatic environment. So far our attempts to test this have been unsuccessful because supraphysiologic Na + concentrations have osmotic effects on the cell that disrupt transepithelial conductance (unpublished data).</p><p>Our model also predicts a single-pore conductance of 70 pS at the physiological Na + concentrations in which we observe a macroscopic claudin-2 conductance of ‫ف‬ 10 mS/cm 2 . As discussed in the online supplemental material, the channel geometry and the choice of protein dielectric constant affect the predicted single-channel conductance. For example, while keeping all other parameters the same, a cylindrical channel with a uniform pore size of 3.25 and 32 Å in length gave a channel conductance almost 1.7 times smaller than the claudin-2 model with conical vestibules (same minimum pore size and channel length, but with a funnel-like channel entrance). However, despite some inevitable uncertainties regarding the claudin-2 model channel, our Brownian dynamics simulations together with the deduced P Na ), and combining the mutations appeared to be additive <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">( Hou et al., 2005 )</ref>. At fi rst sight, these results would seem to suggest that the fi rst extracellular domain of claudin-16 is folded in such a way as to bring together the side groups of multiple acidic residues that are arranged nonlinearly, thus forming the selectivity fi lter. However, it is important to remember that replacement of a charged residue, even with a neutral residue, can have multiple consequences, including steric effects and disruption of folding due to the abolition of salt bridges, all of which could abrogate permeability. Thus, without specifi c studies to prove that the mutation directly affects electrostatic interaction between the pore and the permeating ion (such as alkali metal selectivity sequences and pH titration), the composition of the selectivity fi lter in claudin-16 remains unproven.</p><p>When the amino acid sequences of the fi rst extracellular loop of all claudins are aligned <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">( Fig. 12 )</ref>, one can observe that the homologous position to D65 in claudin-2 has a basic residue in the majority (15/22) of the other isoforms. The only other isoform with an acidic residue at this position is claudin-16, which also acts as a cation-selective pore. Furthermore, the next position downstream, 66, is also occupied by an acidic residue in claudin-16; the only other claudins that have an acidic residue here are 10b and 15, the only other known cation-selective, pore-forming claudins , and 22 (whose function is unknown). Finally, position 64 is occupied by one of the two invariant cysteines found in the extracellular domain of all claudins, suggesting that it may have a structural role, perhaps in intramolecular disulfi de bonding. We therefore postulate that C64 anchors the two residues at positions 65 and 66 so that their side chains protrude into the lumen of the pore and can contribute to an electrostatic cation interaction site.</p><p>Our Brownian dynamics simulations show that our experimental results can be mimicked by a very simple pore model. The tertiary structure of the extracellular domains of claudin has not yet been solved, and so several somewhat arbitrary assumptions had to be made to construct this fi rst-pass model. Furthermore, we performed sensitivity analyses (see Online Supplemental Material II) to investigate the effect of the channel geometry, protein dielectric constants, and the effective charges and positions of D65 on ion permeation through the claudin-2 model pore. We found that over experimentally reasonable ranges of these parameters, the basic computational conclusions reached for the claudin-2 model pore developed herein did not change. The value of this model is that it clearly shows that two competing factors -the ion diffusivity and the ion size -can determine the relative permeability ratio of cations observed in the claudin-2. Additionally, it shows that the mere presence of D65 contributing the major intrapore charges could be suffi cient to explain the ob-maximum channel conductance (with respect to variations in concentration as well as the assumed effective charge on D65) suggest a maximum single-channel conductance on the order of ‫ف‬ 100 pS for claudin-2. MDCK cells are approximately hexagonal and have an average radius of 7 μ m <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">( Cereijido et al., 1983 )</ref>, and hence an area of 1.5 × 10 Ϫ 6 cm 2 and a cell perimeter of 42 μ m. From this, we estimate that the conductance of the intercellular junction must be 100 pS per 100 nm. We do not explicitly account for strand number in our model, but assuming there are four identical strands in a series, we would estimate that there is one claudin-2 pore every 25 nm along each tight junction strand, a fairly low pore density.</p><p>In conclusion, our data suggest that claudin-2 forms narrow, water-fi lled cation-selective paracellular pores. Cation selectivity is achieved by a negatively charged site within the pore with which partially dehydrated permeating cations interact, and which can be titrated by pH. Our studies further suggest that a signifi cant part of this interaction site is contributed by the carboxylate side chain of D65 and suggest that the homologous residues at positions 65 and 66 may play similar roles in other claudin family members. Thus, paracellular claudin-based pores use discrete intrapore electrostatic interactions to achieve high conductance together with charge selectivity.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.

We also wish to thank the reviewers, who played a collaborative role in revising aspects of this manuscript, particularly with regard to the method of correcting for liquid junction potentials. This turned out to be critical in arriving at quantitatively accurate data and changed our conclusions significantly, and has also led to a signifi cant change in the way we now perform diffusion potential experiments in our laboratories.</p><p>This work was supported by National Institutes of Health grants DK062283 (to A.S.L.
