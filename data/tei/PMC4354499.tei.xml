			<abstract>
				<p>Gene targeting refers to the precise modification of a genetic locus using homologous recombination. The generation of novel cell lines and transgenic mouse models using this method necessitates the construction of a &apos;targeting&apos; vector, which contains homologous DNA sequences to the target gene, and has for many years been a limiting step in the process. Vector construction can be performed in vivo in Escherichia coli cells using homologous recombination mediated by phage recombinases using a technique termed recombineering. Recombineering is the preferred technique to subclone the long homology sequences (&gt;4kb) and various targeting elements including selection markers that are required to mediate efficient allelic exchange between a targeting vector and its cognate genomic locus. Typical recombineering protocols follow an iterative scheme of step-wise integration of the targeting elements and require intermediate purification and transformation steps. Here, we present a novel recombineering methodology of vector assembly using a multiplex approach. Plasmid gap repair is performed by the simultaneous capture of genomic sequence from mouse Bacterial Artificial Chromosome libraries and the insertion of dual bacterial and mammalian selection markers. This subcloning plus insertion method is highly efficient and yields a majority of correct recombinants. We present data for the construction of different types of conditional gene knockout, or knock-in, vectors and BAC reporter vectors that have been constructed using this method. SPI vector construction greatly extends the repertoire of the recombineering toolbox and provides a simple, rapid and cost-effective method of constructing these highly complex vectors.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>The development of gene targeting technologies has enabled the construction of cell lines and mouse models to investigate different biological systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> . A key first stage in the modification of a genomic sequence is the design and construction of a gene targeting vector <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> .</p><p>Targeting vectors are plasmid constructs that carry the allele of interest containing the desired modifications(s) flanked by a selection marker (e.g., neomycin), and long genomic regions required for efficient homologous recombination in mammalian cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> . Precise gene modification is achieved by the introduction of the targeting vector into embryonic stem (ES) cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> or somatic cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> , whereby homologous recombination between identical stretches of DNA sequence on the targeting vector and the genomic locus results in the transfer of the intended modification to the genome by gene conversion <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> . Such modified ES cells can be injected into mouse blastocysts to produce offspring (chimaeras) that can then transmit these modified alleles via the germline <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> . An alternate route to produce transgenic mice involves the microinjection of a gene expression vector into single celled mouse zygotes, which leads to the random integration of the vector in the mouse genome <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> . Traditional methods of vector construction have relied on conventional 'cut and paste' cloning using restriction enzymes and DNA ligases to clone the different selection marker and genomic fragments into a vector backbone. However, an inherent limiting factor of traditional cloning is the positioning and choice of restriction sites, especially with longer DNA sequences. This often necessitates multiple subcloning steps and also introduces extraneous DNA sequences into the vector, which often leads to a lower efficiency of gene targeting.</p><p>Recombineering (recombinogenic engineering) is a DNA engineering technology that overcomes these limitations by using homologous recombination (HR) mediated by phage recombination proteins in E. coli cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> . Since any region of a homologous sequence can serve as a substrate of recombineering, the constraints of availability of restriction sites are removed. Large DNA sequences can be seamlessly modified directly in vivo, thus also preserving their structural integrity <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> . Recombineering is very efficient with short homologies (50 bp) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> and therefore homology arms (HA) can be conveniently incorporated into synthetic oligo sequences. In a typical recombineering experiment, an oligo or a double stranded DNA (dsDNA) fragment containing HA is electroporated into recombineering competent E. coli cells containing the target located either on the chromosome or on a plasmid</p><p>. The annealing of a long ssDNA or a short oligo to its complementary target sequence occurs on the lagging strand of the replication fork and leads to the incorporation of the sequence at the target site. Lagging strand ssDNA recombination is the basis of the high efficiency of recombineering and can be described by the 'beta' recombination model <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> .</p><p>A typical recombineering workflow to build a gene targeting vector involves either of the two following routes. One route involves subcloning the desired genomic region from a mouse BAC clone into a plasmid followed by the sequential insertion of LoxP recombination sites, a selection marker <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> etc., or the alternative route involves targeting the BAC genomic locus with the different targeting vector elements by multiple rounds of recombineering <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> and then subcloning the modified locus into a plasmid by gap repair cloning <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> .</p><p>Variations on this theme have been used in different high-throughput recombineering pipelines as part of large mouse production programs <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> . However, these procedures involve complicated and lengthy stages, require the use of specialized vectors and E. coli strains (e.g., Cre expressing cells) and utilize one or more intermediate steps of vector DNA purification and re-transformation ( <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 1)</ref>. Subcloning plus insertion (SPI) is a novel recombineering technique that combines beta recombination and gap repair cloning into a single process <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 1)</ref>. SPI vector assembly is simple, quick and flexible and offers significant improvement on standard recombineering approaches ( <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 1)</ref>. Here, we demonstrate the ease and utility of using SPI for different vector construction applications with a particular emphasis on constructing non-standard and challenging vector designs. Test cases included the construction of a fluorescent reporter knockin vector, a dual tagged protein expression knockin vector, a BAC fluorescent reporter vector and a conditional knockout vector. These examined variously the requirement to localize a cell surface receptor, purify a nuclear protein complex or conditionally ablate the expression of a gene.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Gene Targeting Design</head><p>1. Order an appropriate BAC clone covering the genomic region of interest. Ensure that this is isogenic to the type of ES cells to be modified e.g., RPCI-23 and RPCI-24 BAC clones for gene targeting with C57BL/6 ES cells. 2. Apply conventional gene targeting criteria when designing the targeting vector. Key parameters include whether the modification is required to be constitutive or conditional, defining critical exons (CE) for deletion in a gene knockout strategy and spacing and placement of intronic cassettes. NOTE: Each of these has been discussed in detail elsewhere 10 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Choose genomic regions each of 5-6 kb flanking the target modification site.</head><p>NOTE: The size of the subcloned insert is therefore typically 10-12 kb, although the upper limit can be as high as 80 kb with a low copy subcloning plasmid like p15A, pBR322 etc. and up to 200 kb with a BAC vector.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Multiplex Recombineering Oligos</head><p>1. Design oligos for the plasmid backbone (subcloning plasmid) and the selectable marker (insertion cassette). Design each oligo such that it contains 180 bp HA flanking the genomic target site and 20 bp of specific priming sequence of the insertion cassette or the subcloning plasmid ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2)</ref>. NOTE: Homology arms should not contain any repetitive elements, presence of repetitive elements will result in incorrect targeting and subcloning. Repetitive elements can be detected by using web based tools such as the ''Repeat Masker''. 2. Include a unique restriction enzyme (RE) site on one of the vector oligos to linearize the gene targeting vector for ES cell targeting <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 2</ref>). 3. Check oligo parameters using an oligo analyzer program. Take care to avoid secondary structures in the priming regions. 4. Shorter HA (50 bp) of the insertion cassette is tolerated and yields lower number of recombinants but ensure that the subcloning plasmid HA is always longer (180 bp). 5. Determine the orientation of the genomic DNA insert of the particular BAC clone using web based tools like ''cloneDB''. Establish the direction of replication from OriS by checking the map of the BAC plasmid backbone used in the BAC library construction. NOTE: OriS is usually opposite to the transcriptional direction of the Chloramphenicol (Chl) marker for all commonly used BAC plasmids. 6. Add two terminal phosphorothioate (PTO) bonds to the 5' end of the oligo that is opposite to the direction of replication on the BAC clone. Add a 5' phosphate modification to the reverse oligo ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2)</ref>. NOTE: The asymmetric phosphorothioated PCR cassette upon Red digestion generates an ssDNA intermediate that can prime the lagging strand of the replication fork. NOTE: Maximal multiplex recombination frequency is observed with the lagging strand protected cassettes. Leading strand protected or dual protected cassettes may not produce equivalent recombination efficiencies at some loci. 7. Order oligos with PAGE or HPLC purification. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Preparation of Insertion Cassettes and Subcloning Plasmids</head><p>1. To incorporate HA into the insertion cassette(s) and the subcloning plasmid, perform polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the long modified oligos as described below. 1. Optional: to prevent plasmid carryover into the recombineering reaction, use an R6K origin or similar narrow host range plasmid template to amplify the insertion cassette. 2. Alternatively, linearize the plasmid template using an RE digest ( <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2)</ref>. Choose a RE that cuts outside the PCR amplification region and is heat inactivated. Heat inactivate the RE as recommended by the manufacturer. 3. Set up polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using a high-fidelity hotstart DNA polymerase system. Prepare a PCR master mix as detailed ( <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 3)</ref>. Perform thermal cycling as shown ( <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 3</ref>).</p><p>2. Analyze PCR products by agarose gel electrophoresis. Load 1-5 μl of each PCR onto a 1% (w/v) agarose gel containing 0.5 mg ml -1 Ethidium Bromide (EtBR). NOTE: The presence of non-specific amplification products does not interfere in the recombineering reaction. In some cases however, primer-dimers may decrease recombineering efficiency. 3. Purify PCR products using a PCR purification kit.</p><p>1. Optional: remove the plasmid template from PCRs by treatment with DpnI followed by PCR clean-up. Elute DNA in a minimal volume of sterile deionized water (as recommended by the manufacturer). NOTE: Addition of DpnI to unpurified PCR reactions results in reduced efficiency of cleavage of the methylated plasmid DNA template.</p><p>4. Quantify PCR amplified DNA by agarose gel analysis against a known set of DNA standards e.g., λ HindIII digest or by using a nanodrop spectrophotometer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Subcloning Plus Insertion</head><p>1. Dilute the O/N BAC gbaA culture 50 fold by adding 200 μl in 10 ml LB+Chl+Tet. Grow at 30 °C shaking at 200 rpm for 1 hr 50 min. Include an sample to be used as negative control. 2. Chill all recombineering materials and equipment to 4 °C as described in step 3.1.2. 3. Pour LB agar pH 8 plates containing the correct concentration of the appropriate selective antibiotic(s) that will allow selection of the DNA fragment that is inserted as well as for the selection of the subcloning vector ( <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 4)</ref>. NOTE: Some antibiotics are pH sensitive. Use LB agar pH 8 as a rule. 4. Prepare a 10% (w/v) solution of L-Arabinose. Filter sterilize through a 0.2 μm syringe filter. NOTE: Arabinose induces the expression of the recombineering proteins from the gbaA plasmid. 5. Check the OD of the BAC gbaA culture using a spectrophotometer. Once an OD 600 of 0.25-0.3 is reached, induce the recombineering proteins as described in the following step. 6. Add 200 μl of the 10% Arabinose solution to 10 ml of the BAC culture to achieve a final concentration of Arabinose of 0.2%. Include an uninduced culture (without Arabinose) to be used as negative control. 7. Transfer the BAC culture to a 37 °C shaking incubator and induce Red expression for 45 min shaking at 230 rpm. NOTE: Expression of Red proteins is inefficient at 30 °C . 8. Spin down cells and wash with 10% glycerol 3 times as described in step 3.1.5. 9. Add 600-1,000 ng each of the subcloning plasmid and the insertion cassette(s) to the recombineering reaction. Include a vector only and vector plus single insert controls to check the recombination proficiency and integrity of the vector and the cassettes. 10. Obtain a single cell suspension by pipetting up and down. Perform electroporation as described in step 3.1.7 and subsequent recovery in 1 ml LB at 37 °C for 1 hr for multi-copy plasmids or in 10 ml of LB at 37 °C for 3 hr for BAC vectors. 11. Plate different dilutions of the recovered culture e.g., 90%, 10%, 1% on the dual selection agar plates and grow at 37 °C for 16 hr. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Representative Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Knockin Vectors</head><p>Knockin targeting vectors reflect the need to introduce a novel sequence feature in the genome including single base pair substitution in a protein coding region, the fusion of a fluorescent marker or an affinity tag to a protein or the integration of a gene expression cassette. To test the application of SPI in knockin vector construction strategies, two different test cases were examined. Dnttip1 encodes the deoxynucleotidyltransferase, terminal, interacting protein 1A (TDIF1) that together with class I histone deacetylase (HDAC) form a mitotic deacetylase complex (MiDAC)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>28</head><p>. To investigate the role of Dnttip1 in cell division, a tandem-affinity tagging approach was taken to isolate the TDIF1 interacting proteins. Previous attempts to subclone a portion of the Dnttip1 gene using a p15A vector containing long homology regions resulted in low gap repair efficiency and frequent aberrant recombination products (data not shown). Thus, the construction of a knockin vector at the Dnttip1 locus provided a challenging recombineering exercise. A SPI strategy was designed to subclone a 12 kb section of the Dnttip1 gene spanning the last exon (exon 13) into a low copy p15A vector and to simultaneously insert a dual affinity tag selection cassette into exon 13, replacing the stop codon ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3A)</ref>. The 2X FLAG-calmodulin binding protein (CBP) linked FRT-PGK-em7-Neomycin (Neo)-BGhpA-FRT cassette (2.0 kb) was amplified from an RE linearized plasmid using dual PTO modified oligos that contained 120 bp HA flanking the Dnttip1 stop codon. A p15A zeoDnttip1 subcloning vector (1.7 kb) was constructed that contained 200 bp regions homologous to the ends of the Dnttip1 sequence to be subcloned. The Dnttip1 subcloning plasmid was RE linearized and PCR amplified using 20 bp modified oligos that generated a leading strand protected vector. The PCR products were DpnI treated, purified and co-electroporated into recombineering competent Dnttip1 BAC E. coli cells as well as uninduced control cells. The SPI reactions were plated on Zeocin (Zeo) and Kanamycin (Kan) containing agar plates ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3B)</ref>. SPI produced the correctly modified Dnttip1 knockin vector in all of the 12 recombinants analysed <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Figure 3C)</ref>. DNA sequencing verified the absence of any errors resulting from oligo synthesis or PCR amplification.</p><p>Another example of SPI involved the in-frame insertion of an enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (eYFP) linked selection cassette at the P2rx1 gene. The P2rx1 gene encodes a G-protein-coupled receptor that functions as an ATP-gated ion channel <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> . Linkage to YFP fluorescence permits the tracking of the P2x1 receptor on the cell surface in various functional assays. P2rx1 is another difficult locus that has presented significant problems with conventional recombineering methodologies (data not shown). Using SPI, a 12 kb segment of the P2rx1 gene encompassing the terminal exon (exon 12) was subcloned into a p15A zeo vector and modified with the concerted insertion of an eYFP-LoxP flanked Neo cassette replacing the stop codon in exon 12 to construct the P2rx1-eYFP knockin vector ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3D)</ref>. In this example, the lagging strand protected p15A vector (1.7 kb) contained 230 bp HA and the eYFP cassette contained 50 bp HA and was also left unmodified. The eYFP insertion cassette (2.7 kb) was assembled by splicing overlap PCR of the eYFP gene, PCR amplified from pEYFP-C1, and the LoxP-PGK-em7-Neo-BGhpA-LoxP cassette, PCR amplified from pL452 (NCI, Frederick). The SPI reaction produced hundreds of colonies (data not shown). RE analysis of DNA minipreps prepared from 11 clones showed the majority contained the correctly assembled P2rx1-eYFP knockin vector ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3E)</ref>. Additional validation by DNA sequencing showed error free insertion of the eYFP cassette. However, some of the clones showed profiles of the untagged gap repaired and the tagged gap repaired plasmids in the same cell (lanes 6-9). A few samples also contained incorrectly gap repaired (lane 2) or mistargeted plasmids <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(lanes 4 and 5)</ref>. The failure of concurrent subcloning and targeting in some SPI recombinants highlights the limits of efficient SPI cloning when using large cassettes (&gt; 3 kb), which arise from the constraints on Red processivity of long DNA fragments <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> , or if using short HA. Indeed, increasing the HA of the eYFP cassette to 200 bp increased SPI efficiency and the correct targeting of the cassette (data not shown). Gene targeting with the P2rx1-eYFP knockin vector in JM8.N4 mouse ES cells (C57BL/6 strain) generated 6 positive clones out of 96, which contained the correctly targeted P2rx1-eYFP sequence <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Figure 3F)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>BAC Reporter Vectors</head><p>A BAC clone of the target gene often contains all the requisite upstream and downstream regulatory elements e.g., enhancers, UTRs etc. as well the endogenous promoter to drive gene expression at natural levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> . A BAC reporter vector is therefore the preferred vehicle to recapitulate the endogenous expression pattern of a gene 32 . However, the large size of a BAC plasmid (up to 200 kb) presents significant practical problems with transfecting an intact BAC into cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> . Reducing the size of the BAC genomic insert through BAC trimming <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> , while retaining the necessary regulatory elements of a gene, enables easier handling of the BAC and results in a more efficient transfection. Current BAC engineering technology involves multiple rounds of recombineering to achieve this goal <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> . To demonstrate the utility of SPI in BAC trimming, a pBeloBAC11</p><p>BAC vector was used to subclone a 30 kb genomic sequence including the full length P2rx1 gene from the 168 kb P2rx1 BAC together with the simultaneous insertion of an eYFP cassette in the P2rx1 gene ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4A)</ref>. The pBeloBAC11 zeo vector backbone (6.5 kb) containing 180 bp HA was PCR amplified with modified oligos that generated a lagging strand protected vector. The same eYFP Neo cassette (3 kb), used in the previous P2rx1 knockin vector construction, was PCR amplified using lagging strand protected oligos containing 180 bp HA and targeted the P2rx1 exon 12 replacing the stop codon. Following combined electroporation of the eYFP cassette and the pBeloBAC11 zeo vector into P2rx1 BAC cells expressing the gbaA recombineering proteins, the culture was recovered in 10 ml LB pH 8 for 3 hr at 37C to segregate the BAC plasmids. Pure recombinants were selected on Zeo and Kan agar plates and were observed at a frequency of 2 x 10 -6</p><p>. Colony PCR genotyping analysis revealed successful BAC trimming in the 3 out of 6 clones that were analysed ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4B)</ref>. Long range PCR amplification across the eYFP insertion site confirmed the correct cassette incorporation in the three positive clones ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4B)</ref>. The three clones lacking the eYFP insert were also incorrectly gap repaired at the 5' end, though the cause of mistargeting of the eYFP cassette in these clones may be separate to the correct closure of the 5' BAC end. The three eYFP positive BAC clones were further analysed with RE digests and showed the expected pattern of the correctly trimmed eYFP recombinant BAC ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4C)</ref>. Sequence analysis revealed absence of errors in the eYFP cassette in only 1 clone out of the 3 positives.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conditional Knockout (cko) Vectors</head><p>Conditional ablation of gene expression is an important tool to investigate developmental processes or to study biological systems at a particular time point. A conditional gene knockout strategy typically involves the placement of LoxP recombination sites surrounding a critical exon (CE). The deletion of a CE upon Cre expression or activation produces a frameshift and a premature stop codon, resulting in degradation of the mRNA due to nonsense mediated decay (NMD). The construction of a conditional gene targeting vector is a complex task and involves several steps of subcloning, targeting and transformation</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>22</head><p>. SPI offers a convenient route to simplify this process. As a test case, a conditional allele of the Zrsr2 gene was constructed using the SPI methodology ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5A)</ref>. The Zrsr2 gene encodes a splicing factor and a single copy is located on the X chromosome. The conditional status of gene deletion is particularly important in this instance to control for the possibility of cells adapting to the lack of Zrsr2 during ES cell selection in a constitutive gene deletion targeting strategy. SPI was performed to subclone a 10 kb portion of the ZrSr2 gene with concurrent insertion of two different LoxP flanked selection cassettes. The FRT-PGK-em7-Neo-FRT-LoxP cassette (2 kb) was PCR amplified from RE digested pL451 using lagging strand protected oligos that contained 180 bp HA targeting the ZrSr2 intron 2.</p><p>A second cassette containing Rox-PGK-em7-Blasticidin (Bsd)-Rox-LoxP (2 kb) was PCR amplified from an R6K plasmid with lagging strand protected oligos containing 180 bp HA identical to a downstream region in intron 3. The two LoxP sites flanked exon 3, the CE whose deletion upon conditional Cre activation results in a frameshift and introduces a premature stop codon. The Zrsr2 subcloning plasmid (1.6 kb) was PCR amplified from an RE linearised p15A zeo plasmid using lagging strand protected oligos containing 180 bp HA matching the ends of the 10 kb Zrsr2 sequence. SPI reactions were performed as described before and plated on Zeo+Neo+Bsd plates. The ZrSr2 conditional targeting vector was successfully assembled in most of the 12 recombinants examined <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Figure 5B)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Construction of ES cell lines and mouse models has historically involved gene targeting using plasmid constructs that contained the modified allele 4 . However, the construction of these complex gene targeting vectors has proved to be a significant bottleneck in the timely production of such models. The development of recombineering based vector construction strategies has allowed improved vector designs and more efficient vector assembly. Nonetheless, current recombineering protocols still involve multiple steps, require intermediate plasmid purification and use different bacterial strains. Subcloning plus insertion offers a novel approach to vector construction that can be performed in one electroporation event in the resident BAC host strain. The utility of SPI in gene targeting was tested here in a variety of vector construction applications. In all instances examined here, SPI proved to be efficient and the correct recombinant plasmid was produced. In the majority of the cases, the multiple different cassettes were correctly inserted in the targeting vector. Large DNA cassettes and vectors were easily accommodated in the SPI protocol and demonstrated the flexibility of this system. SPI relies on the use of long homology sequences and phosphorothioate (PTO) protection of the linear DNA cassettes. PTO modification confers protection against exonucleases to the linear DNA <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> and the long HA increases recombination efficiency to permit multiplexing. However, synthesis of longer oligo sequences increases the chances of accumulating errors especially deletions. Mutations in the oligo can be particularly detrimental if they cover protein coding regions. DNA sequencing across the HA and covering the full-length of the inserted cassette is highly recommended to eliminate clones with any sequence alterations. Use of a high-fidelity DNA polymerase system is also suggested to avoid introduction of any PCR errors. The length and composition of the HA of the subcloning plasmid is more critical relative to that of the insertion cassette (data not shown). For particularly sensitive applications like construction of knockin vectors, where any mutations in exon regions are not tolerated, the HA of the insertion cassette can be shortened (50-120 bp) to avoid problems associated with long oligos. The insertion cassette can also be left unmodified or dual phosphorothioated (where knowledge of the direction of replication is not available). But multiplexing in these cases still requires long protected HA subcloning plasmids. A caveat of this particular strategy is the lowering of multiplexing efficiency that can potentially impact SPI cloning at different loci.</p><p>The length of the insertion cassette and the subcloning plasmid is another important parameter in SPI cloning. Larger DNA molecules electroporate less efficiently and the effect is cumulative, given the requirement to introduce all the cassettes in the same cell (data not shown).</p><p>Multiplexing is most efficient with smaller insertion cassettes. DNA fragments larger than 3 kb also place a limit on Red mediated ssDNA processing, which is most efficient up to 3 kb</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>30</head><p>. Insertion cassettes exceeding 3 kb are dual resected and recombine less efficiently via a beta independent pathway 20 . Therefore, screening of sufficient colonies to identify the correct clone becomes important in these cases. A longer duration of recombination post electroporation also increases the chances of recovery of the correct clone in difficult SPI exercises. Up to four small cassettes (&lt; 1.5 kb) can be inserted simultaneously with the SPI process, though the multiplexing efficiency decreases with each additional cassette (data not shown). However, this reflects the outcome of an optimal SPI experiment and it is advisable to consider the limits of multiplexing when using many large cassettes.</p><p>The development of genome editing tools like clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-cas9 endonuclease system has enabled the creation of novel genome modifications and has led to more efficient genome engineering <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> . However, these newer technologies have complemented gene targeting vectors rather than supplanted them. It is envisaged that the CRISPR-cas system could replace antibiotic selection and further refine the multiplex recombineering protocol.</p></div>
