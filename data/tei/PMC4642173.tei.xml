			<abstract>
				<p>In this article, a novel derivative-free (DF) surrogate-based trust region optimization approach is proposed. In the proposed approach, quadratic surrogate models are constructed and successively updated. The generated surrogate model is then optimized instead of the underlined objective function over trust regions. Truncated conjugate gradients are employed to find the optimal point within each trust region. The approach constructs the initial quadratic surrogate model using few data points of order O(n), where n is the number of design variables. The proposed approach adopts weighted least squares fitting for updating the surrogate model instead of interpolation which is commonly used in DF optimization. This makes the approach more suitable for stochastic optimization and for functions subject to numerical error. The weights are assigned to give more emphasis to points close to the current center point. The accuracy and efficiency of the proposed approach are demonstrated by applying it to a set of classical benchmark test problems. It is also employed to find the optimal design of RF cavity linear accelerator with a comparison analysis with a recent optimization technique. ª 2014 Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of Cairo University.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>In general, engineering systems are characterized by some designable parameters and some performance measures. The desired performance of a system (design specifications) is described by specifying bounds on the performance measures of the system which is set by the designer. The conventional system design aims at finding values of the system designable parameters that merely satisfy the design specifications. In general, there will be a multitude of acceptable designs. However, for contemporary engineering design, other criterion (objective function) can be chosen for comparing the different alternative acceptable designs (optimization problem) and for selecting the best one (optimal system design). Naturally, system performance measures and the objective functions are functions of system parameters values and evaluated through system simulations. For intensive CPU engineering systems, the high expense of the required system simulations may obstruct the optimization process.</p><p>In practice, robust optimization methods that utilize the fewest possible number of function evaluations are greatly required <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>. Another difficulty is the absence of any gradient information as the required simulations cost in evaluating the gradient information is prohibitive in practice <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Attempting to approximate the function gradients using the finite difference approach requires much more function evaluations, which highly increase the computational cost. Another objection in estimating the gradients by finite differencing is that the estimated function values are usually contaminated by some numerical noise due to estimation uncertainty. Hence, gradient-based optimization methods cannot be applied here.</p><p>For such optimization problems, only derivative free optimization (DFO) methods can be applicable <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Further, the derivative free trust region methods usually handle such problems more efficiently as the trust region framework constitutes one of the most important globally convergent optimization methods, which has the ability to converge to a solution starting from any arbitrary initial point <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. In addition, these methods use computationally cheap surrogate-based models that can be constructed by using function evaluations at some selected points. These surrogate models may be response surfaces, radial basis method, neural networks, kriging, etc.</p><p>The majority of the existing derivative-free trust region techniques have the following features:</p><p>They require a relatively large number of function evaluations, O(n 2 ) (where n is the number of system design variables) to construct the initial quadratic model. The quadratic surrogate models are constructed via interpolating the objective function at a constant number of points; when a point is obtained a previous point is dropped. In addition, these algorithms usually ignore the valuable information contained in all previously evaluated expensive function values.</p><p>The work presented in this article introduces a new derivative free trust region approach that neither require nor approximate the gradients of the objective function. It implements a non-derivative optimization method that combine a trust region framework with quadratic fitting surrogates for the objective function <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>. The principal operation of the method relies on building, successively updating and optimizing quadratic surrogate models of the objective function over trust regions. The quadratic surrogate models reasonably reflect the local behavior of the objective function in a trust region around the current iterate and they are optimized instead of the objective function over trust regions.</p><p>Truncated conjugate gradient method by <ref type="bibr">Steihaug [9]</ref> is used to find the optimal point within each trust region. The approach constructs the initial quadratic surrogate model using few data points of order O(n). In each iteration of the proposed approach, the surrogate model is updated using a weighted least squares fitting. The weights are assigned to give more emphasis to points close to the current center point. The accuracy and efficiency of the proposed approach are demonstrated by applying it on a set of classical benchmark test problems and comparisons with a recent optimization technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> are also included.</p><p>The linear accelerators (LINACS) provide beams of high quality and high energy in which charged particles move on a linear path and are accelerated by electromagnetic fields.</p><p>The modern LINAC typically consists of sections of specially designed waveguides that are excited by RF electromagnetic fields, usually in the very high frequency (VHF) range. The accelerating structures are tuned to resonance and are driven by external, high-power RF power tubes, such as klystrons. The accelerating structures must efficiently transfer the electromagnetic energy to the beam, and this is accomplished through an optimized configuration of the internal geometry, so that the structure can concentrate the electric field along the trajectory of the beam promoting maximal energy transfer, by adding nose cones to create a region of more concentrated axial electric field as shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>. RF cavity analysis and design brought researchers and engineers' attention due to its extensive applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Applications include: medicinal purposes in radiation therapy, food sterilization and transmute nuclear fuel waste, etc. Design tools include: the computer code SUPERFISH <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, 3-D code MAFIA <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> and CST Studio Suite <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</p><p>Design of accelerator RF cavities may include optimization of some of cavity parameters. Among the parameters characterizing the operation of the RF cavities are, the average accelerating field Eacc, peak fields to accelerating field (Epk/Eacc, Hpk/Eacc), quality factor, and cavity shunt impedance R-shunt <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. The parameters considered for optimization depend on the power level fed to the cavity, which limit the average accelerating field, where the constraints on these parameters are imposed by the application. For low power level feed, optimization may focus on maximizing shunt impedance, however for high power operation, limiting the peak fields inside is of concern in order to minimize multipacting <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. In this work we will focus on the low power fed cavities, where maximizing the shunt impedance is of main concern and will be treated through our new optimization approach.</p><p>The new proposed trust region (TR) optimization approach is capable of solving the design problems with either 2D or 3D simulators. It is expected to work as well if a 3D simulator was employed with the expense of more computational time. Most of the accelerators use body of revolution cavity structure which can be solved as 2D structure, saving the computational resources. However, the proposed approach was successfully employed in microwave filter design utilizing 3D full-wave EM solver <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The new trust region approach</head><p>The computationally expensive objective function is locally approximated around a current iterate x k by a computationally cheaper quadratic surrogate model M(x) which can be placed in the form: <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref> Cross section of the cavity with nose cones and spherical outer walls.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">MðxÞ ¼ a þ b T ðx À x k Þ þ 1 2 ðx À x k Þ T Bðx À x k Þ;<label>ð1Þ</label></formula><p>where a 2 R, the vector b 2 R n , and the symmetric matrix B 2 R nÂn are the unknown parameters of M(x). The total number of the model parameters is q = (n + 1)(n + 2)/2. These parameters can be evaluated by interpolating the objective function at q points.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Initial model</head><p>Let x 0 be the initial point that is provided by the user. Initially, assuming that B is a diagonal matrix, then the number of points required to construct the initial model is m = 2n + 1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. The initial m points x i , i = 1, 2, . . ., m, can be chosen as follows <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref> x 1 ¼ x 0 and</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">x iþ1 ¼ x 0 þ D 1 e i ; i ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; n x iþnþ1 ¼ x 0 À D 1 e i ; i ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; m À n À 1 ;<label>ð2Þ</label></formula><p>where D 1 is the initial trust region radius that is provided by the user, and e i is the ith coordinate vector in R n . The initial quadratic model M (1) (x) will have the parameters a <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> , the vector b <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> , and the n diagonal elements of the model Hessian matrix B <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> . These parameters are computed by requiring that the initial model interpolates the objective function f(x) at the initial m points given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref>. Therefore the initial model parameters are obtained by satisfying the matching conditions:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">M ð1Þ ðx i Þ ¼ fðx i Þ; i ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; m:<label>ð3Þ</label></formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model optimization</head><p>At the kth iteration, assume that x k is the current solution point. The model M (k) (x) is then minimized, in place of the objective function, over the current trust region and a new point is produced by solving the trust region sub-problem:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">min s M ðkÞ ðsÞ; subject to ksk D k ;<label>ð4Þ</label></formula><p>where s = x À x k , D k is the current trust region radius, and k Á k throughout is the l 2 -norm. This problem is solved by the method of truncated conjugate gradient by Steihaug <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. It is identical as the standard conjugate gradient method as long as the iterates are inside the trust region. If the conjugate gradient method terminates at a point within the trust region, this point is a global minimizer of the objective function. If the new iterate is outside the trust region, a truncated step which is on the region boundary is considered. Also, the method treats the case where the minimum is in the opposite direction of the conjugate direction which is due to the non convexity of the model <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. One good property of this method is that the solution computed has a sufficient reduction property, which was proved by Bandler and Abdel-Malek <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. Let s * denotes the solution of (4), and then a new point x n = x k + s * is obtained. The achieved actual reduction in the objective function is compared to that predicted reduction using the model by computing the reduction ratio which is given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">r k ¼ actual reduction predicted reduction ¼ fðx k Þ À fðx n Þ M ðkÞ ðx k Þ À M ðkÞ ðx n Þ :<label>ð5Þ</label></formula><p>This ratio reflects how much the surrogate model agrees with the objective function within the trust region. The trust region radius and the current iterate will be updated such that, if r k is sufficiently high, i.e., r k P 0.7, there is a good agreement between the model and the objective function over this step. Hence, it is beneficial to expand the trust region for the next iteration, and to use x n as the new center of the trust region. If r k is positive but not close to 1, i.e., 0.1 6 r k &lt; 0.7, the trust region radius is not altered. On the other hand, if r k is smaller than a certain threshold, r k &lt; 0.1, the trust region radius is reduced. The updating formula used for updating D k and x k can be expressed as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">r k r k &lt; 0:1 : D kþ1 ¼ 1 2 D k 0:1 6 r k 6 0:7 : D kþ1 ¼ D k r k P 0:7 ks Ã k &lt; D k : D kþ1 ¼ D k ks Ã k P D k : D kþ1 ¼ 1:5 Ã D k 8 &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt; &gt; &gt; &gt; :<label>ð6Þ</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_6">x kþ1 ¼ x k þ s Ã ; if r k &gt; 0 x k ; otherwise :<label>ð7Þ</label></formula><p>It is to be mentioned that the current center is the point of least function value achieved so far.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model update</head><p>When a new point is available, the current quadratic model M (k) (x) is updated so that the point of lowest objective function value x k is now the center of the kth trust region. The model will take the form:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">M ðkÞ ðsÞ ¼ a ðkÞ þ s T b ðkÞ þ 1 2 s T B ðkÞ s; s ¼ x À x k and s 2 R n :<label>ð8Þ</label></formula><p>The parameters: a (k) , b (k) and B (k) are evaluated employing the parameter values of the previous model M kÀ1 (x) in addition to all available function values. The constant a (k) is assigned the value of f(x) k , i.e., a (k) = f(x) k . The model will be updated in two steps. First, the vector b (k) is updated then the Hessian matrix B (k) is updated as follows:</p><p>Step1: Updating the vector b <ref type="bibr">(k)</ref> The vector b (k) can be obtained using only n points. However, using the n recent points may result in ill-conditioned system of linear equations. In order to avoid this, it is proposed to use the least squares approximation with the most recent 2n points. So, the vector b (k) is evaluated such that the model M k (x) fits the last 2n points obtained, x i , i = 1, 2, . . ., 2n, i.e., the following condition should be satisfied:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">M ðkÞ ðs i Þ ¼ fðs i Þ; where s i ¼ x i À x k and i ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; 2n:<label>ð9Þ</label></formula><p>When computing the vector b (k) , the matrix B (k) is assigned temporarily the value of the previous model Hessian matrix, B (kÀ1) , hence the vector b (k) is obtained by solving the following system of linear equations:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">Ab ðkÞ ¼ v;<label>ð10Þ</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">A ¼ s T 1 s T 2 .</formula><p>. . : ð11Þ</p><p>The previous system is an over-determined system. The least squares approximation for b (k) is</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">b ðkÞ ¼ ðA T AÞ À1 A T v:<label>ð12Þ</label></formula><p>Step2: Updating the matrix B (k) The model Hessian matrix B (k) is evaluated using the following updating formula:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">B ðkÞ ¼ cB ðkÀ1Þ þ qp T ;<label>ð13Þ</label></formula><p>where c is a positive constant, 0.5 &lt; c &lt; 1, and the vector</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">p 2 R n , q ¼ ½signðdiagðB ðkÀ1Þ ÞÞ Ã ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi ffi ð1 À cÞ Ã jdiagðB ðkÀ1Þ Þj q :<label>ð14Þ</label></formula><p>This choice of q, ensures that changes in B (k) occur gradually. The vector p is evaluated such that the model M (k) (x) tries to fit all the available m points obtained so far, x i , i = 1, 2, . . ., m, i.e., the following condition should be satisfied</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">M ðkÞ ðs i Þ ¼ fðs i Þ; where s i ¼ x i À x k and i ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; m;<label>ð15Þ</label></formula><p>i.e., the vector p is obtained by solving the weighted system of linear equations</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">Ap ¼ v;<label>ð16Þ</label></formula><p>where ; </p><formula xml:id="formula_16">A ¼ 1 2 s T 1 qs T 1 w 1 1 2 s T 2 qs T 2 w 2 . . .</formula><formula xml:id="formula_17">v ¼ w 1 Ã ðfðs 1 Þ À a ðkÞ À s T 1 b ðkÞ À 1 2 s T 1 cB ðkÀ1Þ s 1 Þ w 2 Ã ðfðs 2 Þ À a ðkÞ À s T 2 b ðkÞ À 1 2 s T 2 cB ðkÀ1Þ s 2 Þ . . .</formula><p>To obtain more accurate model in the neighborhood of the current center, the available points are assigned different weights w i , i = 1, 2, . . ., m according to their distances from the trust region center. In the proposed approach the weight w i , associated with each equation, takes the form:</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">w i ¼ 1 ifks i k 6 c 1 D c 1 D ksik if ks i k &gt; c 1 D ; ( i ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; m;<label>ð18Þ</label></formula><p>where c 1 is a positive constant, c 1 P 1.</p><p>The previous system in (16) is an over-determined system (m &gt; n).

A suggested solution to find s new is to solve the following problem:  <ref type="table">)</ref> is found to be less than f(x k ), then x new will be considered as the new trust region center of the subsequent iteration, otherwise, x new will just be added to the available set of points.</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">max s p ¼ X ns i¼1 ðs T i<label>sÞ</label></formula></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Examples</head><p>The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated through two benchmark examples. All results are compared with those obtained by NEWUOA (NEW Unconstrained Optimization Algorithm) by Powell <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. The performance is measured by the number of function evaluations N required to reach the optimal solution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The 2D Beale function</head><p>The function is by <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">fðxÞ ¼ X 3 i¼1 ½a i À x 1 ð1 À x i 2 Þ 2 ;<label>ð21Þ</label></formula><p>where a 1 = 1.5, a 2 = 2.25, and a 3 = 2.625. This function has a valley approaching the line x 2 = 1, and has a minimum of 0 at (3 0.5) T . The initial values used for x 0 and D 1 are (0.1 0.1) T and 0.8, respectively. The results in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 1</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 3</ref> compare the optimal value obtained by applying the proposed technique versus NEWUOA with the same number of function evaluation N. It is to be noticed, that starting from the same initial point and after only 11 iterations; the proposed algorithm gives a function value of 0.8065 while NEWUOA gives 14.2031.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The 3D Box function</head><p>The function was proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">fðxÞ ¼ X i¼10 i¼1 exp Àix 1 10 À exp Àix 2 10 À x 3 exp Ài 10 À expðÀiÞ 2<label>ð22Þ</label></formula><p>This function has a minima at (1 10 1) T , and also along the line{(a a 0) T } with value 0.

However, as the optimization gets closer to the optimum, the methods based on interpolation will be more accurate as expected. This explains why the proposed algorithm is well suited for objective functions that have some uncertainty in their values or subject to statistical variations. This may occur for design of systems whose parameter values are subject to known but unavoidable statistical fluctuations <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>. Also, the algorithm may be useful for surrogate-based system design <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref>. These surrogates are updated during the optimization process, and a few iterations in the optimization process will be sufficient at the beginning. In this case the new technique will produce a significant reduction in few iterations.</p></div>

This can be accomplished through an optimized configuration of its internal geometry, by adding nose cones to create a region of more concentrated axial electric field along the path of the electron beam, as shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>.</p><p>The most useful figure of merit for high field concentration along the beam axis and low ohmic power loss in the cavity walls is the effective shunt impedance per unit length ZT 2 where T is the transient-time factor (a measure of the energy gain reduction caused by the sinusoidal time variation of the field in the cavity, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>).</p><p>One of the main objectives in cavity design is to choose geometry to maximize effective shunt impedance per unit length. This indicates increasing the energy delivered to the beam compared to that thermally lost in the cavity walls. The effective shunt impedance per unit length is usually expressed in mega ohms per meter and is defined by</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">ZT 2 ¼ ðV 0 TÞ 2 PL ;<label>ð23Þ</label></formula><p>where P is the thermal power losses in the walls of the cavity, V 0 = ò E(z)dz = E 0 L, and E 0 is the average axial electric field along the cavity axis with length L. The technique is applied to an RF cavity with resonance frequency 9.4 GHz, shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 5</ref>. The objective is to maximize effective shunt impedance per unit length. In order to do that, we optimize the axial z positions of ten points that describe the cavity curvature through a spline curve. The axial positions z = (z 1 , z 2 ,. . ., z 10 ) T in the z-direction are taken as the design parameters. The radial positions of these points are chosen on a logarithmic scale along r-direction. It is to be noted that during the variation of the curvature, the    resonance frequency is always kept at 9.4 GHz. The initial values used for the ten radial positions z 0 are all set to 0.6 cm and D 1 is set to 0.02 cm. Cavity design generally requires electromagnetic field-solver that solves Maxwell equations numerically for the specified boundary conditions. In the simulations, POISSON and SUPERFISH are used as the main solver programs in a collection of programs from LANL <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr">33]</ref>. The solver is used to calculate the static magnetic and electric fields and radio-frequency electromagnetic fields for either 2-D Cartesian coordinates or axially symmetric cylindrical coordinates. The code SUPER-FISH is used to solve for axisymmetric TM0nl modes, for the field components Hphi, Er and Ez. The solution is obtained through solving Hemholtz equation using finite element method FEM over a triangular mesh subject to the proper boundary conditions and symmetries imposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[34]</ref>.</p><p>Design algorithm shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 6</ref> is implemented in MAT-LAB code, where an initial case is chosen corresponding to ten z positions of points with cavity curvature is described with spline curve (step 2). Then the spline interpolated curve is sampled at 100 points, where those sampled points are considered connected with piecewise linear, approximating the cavity curvature. This piece wise linear description is fed to AUTO-MESH program to generate mesh (step 3). The solution of lowest TM mode of the cavity is made at step 4 by calling SUPERFISH, and the obtained frequency in step 5 is used to scale the cavity dimensions to keep the resonance frequency at 9.4 GH (step 6). The corresponding scaling is reflected on the obtained cavity shunt impedance (step 7), where this value is fed to the optimizer algorithm to determine the new ten points positions. Then the process is repeated starting from step 2.</p><p>The results of the effective shunt impedance per unit length for RF cavity in mega ohm per meter after N function evaluations for both the proposed algorithm and NEWUOA are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 3</ref>.</p><p>It is to be mentioned that starting from the same initial point, the convergence of the proposed algorithm is as best as NEWUOA. However, the advantage of the proposed algorithm is its easy implementation and accessibility for update and modification.</p><p>The figures of optimal cavity using the proposed algorithm and the NEWUOA are shown in Figs. 7 and 8 respectively.</p><p>It worth mentioning that one could criticize the proposed optimized structure, that it contains sharp edge nose, which is difficult to manufacture and is a point of field singularity that causes breakdown. One way to override that problem is to add some curvature to the nose sharp tip, which would slightly reduce the realized shunt impedance.     </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>In this article, a new trust region optimization method that does not require any derivative information has been proposed. In this method, the objective function is approximated via quadratic surrogates, and using few number of initial data points than the exact number of surrogate parameters. Classical benchmark test problems were used to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method. The results obtained showed the ability of the proposed method to rapidly converge to the final region containing the optimum solution when only a limited number of function evaluations is permissible and when a high accuracy is not really necessary. Least-squares fitting is used instead of interpolation which explains the inaccurate solution in case of explicit objective functions. Thus, the proposed method is suitable for stochastic optimization or objectives that suffer from numerical inaccuracy. In addition, the proposed method has been used to obtain the optimal design for the structure of RF cavity which is the major part of any linear accelerator.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>w m Ã ðfðs m Þ À a ðkÞ À s T m b ðkÞ À 1 2 s T m cB ðkÀ1Þ s m Þ</figDesc></figure>

If ||f(x k+1 ) À f(x k )|| 6 d, the algorithm will be terminated with x opt = x k+1 and f opt = f(x k+1 ). If for two successive iterations, r k is negative go to Step 9, else continue. 7. Add the point x n to the set of available points S, if the number of points in S exceeds N max , remove the farthest point from x k+1 . Comment. To avoid severe computational and storage overhead, a bound N max is put to limit the uncontrollable increase in the number of stored points. Specifically, when the number of available points reaches N max the farthest point from the trust region center is removed.
