			<abstract>
				<p>Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE) are characterized by the misfolding of the host encoded prion protein (PrP C) into a pathogenic isoform (PrP Sc) which leads to the accumulation of β-sheet-rich fibrils and subsequent loss of neurons and synaptic functions. Although many compounds have been identified which inhibit accumulation or dissolve fibrils and aggregates in vitro there is no therapeutic treatment to stop these progressive neurodegenerative diseases. Here we describe the effects of the traditional medicinal herb Scutellaria lateriflora (S. lateriflora) and its natural compounds, the flavonoids baicalein and baicalin, on the development of prion disease using in vitro and in vivo models. S. lateriflora extract as well as both constituents reduced the PrP res accumulation in scrapie-infected cell cultures and cell-free conversion assays and lead to the destabilization of pre-existing PrP Sc fibrils. Moreover, tea prepared from S. lateriflora, prolonged significantly the incubation time of scrapie-infected mice upon oral treatment. Therefore S. lateriflora extracts as well as the individual compounds can be considered as promising candidates for the development of new therapeutic drugs against TSEs and other neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer&apos;s and Parkinson&apos;s disease.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) are neurodegenerative diseases which are characterized by the accumulation and deposition of a pathogenic isoform (PrP Sc ) of the host encoded cellular prion protein (PrP C ) designated PrP Sc . Both isoforms share the same amino acid sequence but differ in conformation, resistance to proteinase K (PK), and pathogenicity. PrP Sc tends to oligomerize by a seeded polymerization mechanism followed by the formation of multimers and eventually of fibril structures. This aggregation can be reproduced in an analogous manner in vitro, using cell-based as well as cell-free assays. The evolved PrP Sc like isoforms -termed PrP res -harbor similar biochemical characteristics like resistance to Proteinase K and detection by same antibodies.</p><p>Accumulation of PrP Sc in the central nervous system (CNS) is accompanied by neurological dysfunctions, neuronal vacuolation, and astrocytic gliosis. Although the exact disease causing mechanism is unknown to date, there is evidence for a general neurotoxicity of these aggregates, which deteriorate synaptic function and induce oxidative stress and membrane disruption <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Soto and Estrada, 2008)</ref>. Prion diseases belong to the group of protein misfolding diseases like Alzheimer's (AD), Parkinson's (PD), and Huntington's disease (HD), which are generally characterized by an incorrect folding process of a host encoded protein with a conformation different from its native structure. The misfolding is followed by a self-aggregation and polymerization of the protein according to a "seeding-nucleation" process <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Jarrett and Lansbury, 1993)</ref>.</p><p>As PrP Sc formation and aggregation is the central event in prion diseases, the inhibition of oligomer formation and fibril extension as well as the enhancement of fibril degradation are major targets for the development of therapeutic strategies against TSEs. Several substances have been identified which inhibit PrP res formation and accumulation in vitro and prolonged survival in scrapie-infected animals: Congo red <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Caughey and Race, 1992)</ref>, branched polyamines <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Supattapone et al., 2001)</ref>, porphyrins and phthalocyanines <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Priola et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Caughey et al., 2007)</ref>, heparan sulfate mimetics <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Adjou et al., 2003)</ref>, amphotericin <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Mange et al., 2000)</ref>, curcumine <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Caughey et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Yang et al., 2009)</ref>, and tetracyclines <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(De Luigi et al., 2008)</ref>. However, for various reasons none of these compounds has been included in prevention and treatment regimes for humans yet. Most recently two new substance classes, benzothiazoles <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Geissen et al., 2011)</ref> and diphenylpyrazoles <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Leidel et al., 2011)</ref>, were identified by high-throughput screening approaches that inhibit PrP res accumulation in cell culture models and prolong incubation times in scrapie-infected mice.</p><p>Other therapeutic strategies rely on passive immunization <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(White et al., 2003)</ref>, RNA interference <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Pfeifer et al., 2006)</ref>, RNA aptamers <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Proske et al., 2002)</ref>, copper chelating antibiotics <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Murakami-Kubo et al., 2004)</ref>, or on the induction of autophagy by Lithium <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Heiseke et al., 2009)</ref>.</p><p>Recent studies on AD suggest that phenolic compounds like green tea epigallocatechin gallate <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Rezai-Zadeh et al., 2005)</ref>, herb extracts like grape seed polyphenolic extract <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Wang et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Liu et al., 2011)</ref>, or medicinal herbs like Paeonia suffruticosa <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Fujiwara et al., 2009)</ref> can be used for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.</p><p>The here presented study shows that the American skullcap Scutellaria lateriflora, a traditional medical herb in North America, exhibits strong anti-prion activity. Extracts of this plant have been traditionally used as sedative and for the treatment of insomnia, anxiety, or neuralgia <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Foster, 1996)</ref>. Moreover, we can show here that the crude aqueous extract inhibits prion propagation and dissolves prion aggregates in vitro. Continuous oral administration of S. lateriflora tea (water extract) significantly prolonged incubation times in scrapie-infected mice. Notably, the natural constituents, the flavonoids baicalein and baicalin-hydrate, exhibit the same inhibitory effects on prion propagation and dissolve existing fibrils.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FLAVONOIDS AND TEA OF SCUTELLARIA LATERIFLORA</head><p>Baicalein and baicalein-hydrate were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and solubilized in DMSO. The dried herb S. lateriflora was purchased from Goldener Zweig (Buchholz, Germany). Water extracts (tea) were prepared by mixing 30 g of sliced dry herbs in 1.0 l boiling water for 30 min. After cooling the tea was administered directly to mice. For in vitro experiments tea was lyophilized to yield dried extracts. In cell-based assays the dried material was resuspended in H 2 O, concentrated by a factor of 10 (termed tea concentrate) and added to the cell culture medium. In cell-free conversion assay the dried extract was directly resuspended in the conversion buffer in a final volume of 20 μl.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PROPAGATION OF SCRAPIE STRAINS</head><p>C57Bl/6 mice were inoculated with cloned mouse scrapie strains RML intracerebrally (i.c.; 30 μl of 1% mouse brain homogenate) or intraperitoneally (i.p.; 50 μl of 1% brain homogenate). The health status of the mice was inspected daily, and their body weights were recorded weekly. After the onset of TSE-associated clinical symptoms (and weight loss, abnormal tail tonus, hind limb paralysis), the animals were euthanized. The incubation times were calculated as the time between inoculation and death. The brains were removed and kept as following: one half of each brain was stored at −20˚C, and the other half was fixed in 4% neutral buffered formalin.</p><p>Pathogenic isoform for PrP conversion reactions was purified from brains of C57/Bl6 mice i.c. inoculated with mouse scrapie strain Me7. Brains were taken at the beginning of clinical symptoms in the animals and stored at −20˚C. PrP Sc was purified according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Eiden et al. (2006)</ref>.</p></div>

Three micrometers section were de-paraffinized and rehydrated. Pretreatment included an incubation step with 98% formic acid (15 min) and blocking of the endogenous peroxidase activity with 3% H 2 O 2 /methanol (30 min) followed by autoclaving in citrate buffer (pH 6.0, 20 min). The monoclonal antibody SAF 84 was applied at a dilution of 1:2000 for 2 h at room temperature and detected by avidin-biotin-horseradish peroxidase (Vector Elite).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PRP RES DETECTION FROM CELL CULTURE</head><p>Two scrapie-infected mouse cell lines were used: ScN 2 Acells [RML infected neuroblastoma-(N 2 A)-cells] and SMB-cells ("scrapie-mouse-brain," infected with strain 22F, a gift of TSE Resource Centre at the Institute for Animal Health, UK). ScN 2 Acells were cultured in Opti-MEM, 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), and 5% CO 2 at 37˚C. SMB-cells were cultured in MEM+ [MEM199, 10% newborn calf serum (NCS), 5% FCS] and 5% CO 2 at 35˚C.</p><p>The cell-based assay was carried out according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Leidel et al. (2011)</ref> with two scrapie-infected mouse cell lines: ScN 2 A-cells and SMB-cells. These cells were adapted for dot blot procedure in 96-well plate format to identify potential inhibitors of PrP Sc formation. Compounds were resolved in DMSO and added to cells in eight replicates in concentrations of 10, 100, and 1000 μM (final concentration). After 3 days of incubation in a CO 2 -incubator, the supernatants were removed and cells lysed in 100 μl lysis buffer (50 mM Tris/HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% Na-deoxycholate, 0.5% TX-100, pH 8.0). Lysates were or electrophoresed and immunoblotted as described in the previous section or dot blotted on PVDF membranes using a 96-well dot blot apparatus (Transblotter, Roth). Dot blotting membranes were dried for 1 h at 37˚C and fixed sample incubated with DNAse (100 μg/ml) for 1 h at 37˚C. After rinsing the membranes twice with distilled water, the membrane was incubated with PK (25 μg/ml) for 90 min at 37˚C. The digestion was terminated using PMSF (2 mM) and membranes were rinsed in 3 M guanidium thiocyanate for 10 min followed by washing them five times in distilled water.</p><p>The incubation of the membrane with blocking buffer (PBS-0.1% Tween 20, 5% non-fat dry milk powder) was followed by an incubation for 60 min with polyclonal antibody (pab) Ra 10. Membranes were washed three times for 10 min with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 and then incubated with a secondary antibody bound to peroxidase (Goat anti-rabbit-PO). Afterward, the chemiluminescence substrate ECL (Roche) was applied and incubated on the membrane for 1 min before the light signals on the membrane were detected directly in a camera. The intensity of the PrP Sc signal of each well was quantified by using the Versadoc imaging system. The half maximal (50%) inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) of each compound was calculated from eight independent reactions.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head><p>The effect of S. lateriflora tea on the PrP res formation was first analyzed in vitro using two different scrapie-infected cell lines (SMB and ScN 2 A-cells), which permanently accumulate PrP res . When tea concentrate was added to the culture medium, a dose dependent reduction of PrP res accumulation was observed in SMB as well as ScN 2 A-cells <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 1)</ref>. Cells were cultivated in T25 flasks and incubated with increasing amounts of S. lateriflora tea for 3 days. After this time, cells were harvested and the level of PK-resistant PrP res was assessed by Western blotting. A dilution of 1:500 induced a reduction of PrP res to 58% for ScN 2 A ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1A, lane 2)</ref> and to 64% for SMB ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1B, lane 2)</ref> cells compared to the control <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figures 1A,B, lane 1)</ref>. Dilutions of 1:50 resulted in a reduction to 33% for ScN 2 A-cells ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1A, lane  3)</ref> and 57% for SMB-cells ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1B, lane 3)</ref>. About 1:20 dilutions displayed reduction to 28% for ScN 2 A ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1A, lane 4)</ref> and 47% for SMB-cells ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1B, lane 4)</ref> and reached values of 28.7% for ScN 2 A-cells ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1A, lane 5)</ref> and 42.3% for SMBcells ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1B, lane 5)</ref>. Relative inhibition by tea is depicted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1C</ref>.</p><p>To test the direct effects of tea on the conversion of PrP C to PrP res , a cell-free conversion assay was used in which a purified murine PrP Sc template induced the conversion of recombinant cellular PrP C into a PK-resistant PrP res fragment <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Eiden et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Kupfer et al., 2007)</ref>. Newly converted PrP res -fragments were detected by mab P4 <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 2A, lanes 1-2)</ref>, while PrP Sc aggregates were visualized by the polyclonal antibody Ra10 <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 2B,  lanes 1-2)</ref>. Dried tea extract (3, 0.3, and 0.03 mg respectively) was added to the conversion assay, inhibited PrP res formation and led to clearance of PrP res -fragments <ref type="figure">(Figure 2A, lanes 3-6)</ref>. Even 0.03 mg caused a reduced PrP res formation compared to the control <ref type="figure">(Figure 2A, lanes 7-8)</ref> by 23%.</p><p>Similar results were seen in the case of dissolution of PrP Sc aggregates after PK digestion ( <ref type="figure">Figure 2B)</ref>. In contrast to the control ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2B, lanes 1-2)</ref>, PrP Sc aggregates were completely digested if co-incubated with 3.0 mg dried tea extract ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2B,  lanes 3-4)</ref>, as well as with 0.3 mg ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 2B, lanes 5-6)</ref>. About 0.03 mg dried tea extract induced a partial disaggregation of PrP Sc aggregates ( <ref type="figure">Figure 2B, lanes 7-8)</ref> by 40% compared to the control.</p><p>To further characterize the underlying inhibitory mechanisms, two main polyphenolic compounds of this herbal extract, the flavonoids Baicalin (baicalein 7-O-glucuronide) and its aglycone baicalein (5,6,7-trihydroxyflavone), were studied with regard to their inhibitory properties. Both components have been isolated from this herb previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Awad et al., 2003)</ref> und were also identified in this study as ingredients in the tea by LCMS-IT-TOF hybrid mass spectrometry (data not shown). In addition, a structural analog to baicalein, the flavonoid epicatechin and quercetin were analyzed.</p><p>The potentially inhibitory effects on the PrP res accumulation and conversion were assayed by a cell-based dot blot assay system <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Geissen et al., 2011)</ref> and the cell-free conversion assay. Structures, assay results, and half maximal (50%) inhibitory concentrations (IC 50 ) of both compounds are summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>. The cell-based dot blot assay was carried out with two different scrapie-infected SMB and ScN 2 A-cells again. Cells were seeded in 96 wells and incubated with decreasing concentrations of the corresponding flavonoids (1 mM, 100 and 10 μM). IC 50 values of Baicalein ranged from 138 μM (SMB-cells) to 63.7 μM (ScN 2 Acells). Baicalin showed significantly lower inhibitory effects compared to baicalein in SMB-cells (IC 50 : &gt;1000 μM) as well as in ScN 2 A-cells (IC 50 : 239.8 μM). Two additional flavonoids with similar structure, epicatechin, and quercetin, showed also strong inhibitory effects in both cell-types: epicatechin IC 50 values were 96.6 μM (ScN 2 A-cells) and 106.8 μM (SMB-cells) and quercetin IC 50 values were 36.8 μM (ScN 2 A-cells) and 274.3 μM (SMB-cells; <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>). Baicalein displayed a strong dose dependent inhibitory effects to PrP res formation (IC 50 : 18.48 μM) and dissolution of PrP Sc aggregates (IC 50 : 41.56 μM) in the cell-free conversion assay, in contrast to baicalin which yielded IC 50 values of &gt;1000 μM for PrP res inhibition and 440 μM for PrP Sc dissolution. Epicatechin and quercetin, although highly similar in structural to baicalein, showed no inhibitory effects in cell-free conversion with regards to PrP res formation and PrP Sc disintegration.</p><p>In summary, these data demonstrate that tea of S. lateriflora contains two active compounds, baicalein and baicalin, which are specific inhibitors of PrP C conversion and PrP res amplification in vitro as well as enhance the degradation of PrP Sc fibrils.</p><p>In another set of experiments in vivo effects of S. lateriflora tea were assessed. Wild-type mice were infected either by intracerebrally (i.c.) or intraperitoneally (i.p.) inoculation with mouse scrapie strain RML and the drinking water was replaced by freshly brewed tea starting 2 weeks prior to their inoculation and for the whole lifetime of the mice. Survival times are depicted in <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>. Six Bl6/C57 mice were used for the treatment and compared to six intracerebrally inoculated mice which received normal drinking water. The mean life spans of the control group <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Figure 5A, bold line)</ref> was 147 ± 3.1 dpi <ref type="figure">(Figure 3B)</ref> whereas the tea treated mice <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Figure 5A dashed line)</ref> survived significantly longer (184 ± 26.7 dpi; <ref type="figure">Figure 3B)</ref>. Three of the treated mice survived up to 60 days compared to the control mice. In the case of i.p. inoculation of RML strain, a mean prolongation of 15 days was achieved <ref type="figure">(Figures 3C,D)</ref>. The mean incubation time of the control group <ref type="figure">(Figure 3C, bold line)</ref> was 191 ± 8.6 dpi ( <ref type="figure">Figure 3D)</ref> whereas the tea treated mice <ref type="figure">(Figure 3C, dashed line)</ref> survived significantly longer (206 ± 8.6 dpi; <ref type="figure">Figure 3D)</ref>.</p><p>Brains of the i.c. infected mice were subjected to comparative biochemical and immunohistochemical investigations. PrP immunoblot analysis revealed no differences of PrP Sc banding patterns and total amounts of PrP Sc in both groups. The PrP Sc content in all brains was analyzed after PK digestion and selective precipitation of PrP Sc from corresponding mouse brain homogenates with sodium phosphotungstic acid <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Figure 4)</ref>. No differences</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>The here presented study demonstrates that solubilized ingredients of S. lateriflora not only inhibit the scrapie fibril formation but also destabilize pre-formed PrP Sc fibrils in a concentration dependent manner. Main constituents of the herb were the polyphenolic flavonoids baicalin and baicalein, which were found at high concentrations in corresponding extracts. Both components in purified form showed dose dependent inhibitory properties and thus were the active constituents responsible for the herbs effects on scrapie fibril regulation.</p><p>The strongest effects displayed baicalein, the main metabolite of baicalin, which inhibited PrP res accumulation in both cell-based and cell-free assays and promoted the destabilization of PrP Sc fibrils at low concentrations. A possible molecular mechanism is based on direct binding to the PrP C and the formation of a stable PrP-baicalein/baicalin complex, which blocks PrP conversion and/or accumulation. In the same way the destabilization of pre-existing fibrils would be caused by a specific intercalation of baicalein/baicalin into β-sheet structures of the PrP Sc aggregates which may lead to a forced PrP Sc degradation by lysosomal proteases. Similar effects by Baicalein have been described for the inhibition of α-synuclein <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Zhu et al., 2004)</ref> and amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) fibrillization <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Lu et al., 2011)</ref>.   PrP Sc from RML infected mouse brains and lanes 8-13 PrP Sc from RML infected mouse brains that were treated with tea from S. lateriflora. Western blot was carried out with pab Ra10 and analyzed by chemiluminescence method.</p><p>In our present study oral administration of S. lateriflora tea significantly prolonged incubation of mice either infected intracerebral or intraperitoneal. These effects can be explained by direct interference of baicalein to evolving PrP aggregates in the CNS. Baicalein is able to cross the blood brain barrier and ultimately reach the CNS <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Tsai et al., 2002)</ref>. Baicalin, on the other hand, may act as pro-drug: After oral uptake, the sugar residue is cleaved by enzymes in the intestinal tract to generate baicalein. The more lipophilic baicalein is better absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract and can then enter the brain via the blood system <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Tarragó et al., 2008)</ref>.</p><p>Within the CNS, the inhibition and dissolution of prion aggregates by Baicalein could protect neuronal cells from membrane disruption and subsequent neuronal cell death. Additional antioxidant properties of baicalein on reactive oxygen species (ROS), which evolve during protein aggregation, may reinforce this neuroprotective effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Li et al., 2010)</ref>. Baicalein is able to minimize ROS by directly quenching free radicals or indirectly inducing antioxidant enzymes like superoxide dismutase and catalase <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Shieh et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Kang et al., 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Direct effects on the prion conversion were also seen in other plant derived polyphenols like curcumin which is a strong inhibitor of prion conversion replication in vitro <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Caughey et al., 2003)</ref>. It is in vivo efficacy, however, remains controversial: the oral administration of curcumin had no significant effect on the onset of scrapie in hamsters <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Caughey et al., 2003)</ref>, whereas scrapie-infected mice significantly survived longer after oral treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Riemer et al., 2008)</ref>. Effects of other polyphenols (e.g., tannic acid, katacine, and 2 -2 -bis epigallocatechin gallate) that interfere with PrP conversion in vitro were also studied in vivo <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Kocisko et al., 2003)</ref>. However, neither these substances nor mixtures of natural compounds including polyphenolic tea extract and pine bark extracts displayed any effects on incubation periods in scrapie-infected animals <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Kocisko et al., 2004)</ref>.</p><p>Up to now only few compounds have been reported that delay onset on prion diseases after oral treatment. This includes pravastatin <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Vetrugno et al., 2009)</ref>, which is involved in cholesterol biosynthesis and influences membrane structure and function, fucoidan <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Doh-Ura et al., 2007)</ref>, as well as amyloid dye derivatives <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Kawasaki et al., 2007)</ref>. However, possible drug associated sideeffects have to be further evaluated. Recently, diphenyl-pyrazoles <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Leidel et al., 2011)</ref> were identified as a new class of anti-prion compounds, which prolong incubation time of scrapie-infected mice even after oral application.</p><p>In conclusion, beneficial effects of S. lateriflora tea can be explained by the anti-aggregatory and potential anti-oxidative effects of its natural constituents, baicalein and baicalin. Only few studies were conducted with herbal extracts of S. lateriflora for prevention and therapy of protein misfolding diseases to date. Results shown here for prion diseases are promising also in the context of other diseases in this group.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>FIGURE 1 |</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Western blot analysis of inhibition of PrP res formation in scrapie-infected cells by tea concentrate of S. lateriflora.
