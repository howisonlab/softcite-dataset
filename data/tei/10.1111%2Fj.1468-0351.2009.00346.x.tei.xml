			<abstract>
				<p>This article empirically investigates how the transition to a market economy affected the relationship between motherhood and labour force outcomes in Poland. We estimate different probit models on two panel datasets covering a three-year period before the reform (1987-1989) and a three-year period afterwards (1994-1996). Contrary to a priori expectations, our findings indicate that during transition young children were much less of a deterrent to the employment probability of their mother than they were before transition.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>In this article we investigate the role of motherhood in shaping the employment outcomes of Polish women before and during transition to a market economy. A priori expectations, based on a few indisputable phenomena -the nearly universal female labour market participation in the pre-transition period, the rapid deterioration of child-care facilities during transition, and the increasing discrimination in the labour market against women who could become mothers -suggest that being a mother in transition Poland entailed greater difficulties in combining paid work and family responsibilities than before. However, we will show that employment was more responsive to motherhood before than during transition. In our analysis we will investigate some explanations for this puzzling result and we will discuss the results in the final part of the article.</p><p>There has been very little research on mothers' labour supply choices in transition economies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Fong and Lokshin (2000)</ref> examined how women's labour force activity depends on household child-care choices in Romania. They showed that after transition women's labour market activity was strongly affected by the presence of children and was highly responsive to the cost of child care. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Saget (1999)</ref> estimated a model of labour supply decisions of married women in Hungary to measure the impact of the number and age of children on women's labour supply (in addition to a host of women's characteristics, such as individual wages and a household's non-labour income). Using post-transition data, she found that the presence of young children decreased the probability of a woman participating in the labour market, while the presence of teenagers had the opposite effect.</p><p>These studies suggest that, during transition, women and mothers in Central and Eastern European countries tended to display a labour market behaviour more and more similar to the one of women in Western economies. In their study of participation behaviour of East German women after German unification, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bonin and Euwals (2002)</ref> examined precisely this issue. They wondered how the high unemployment rate and the change in public policies that followed transition impacted the high female labour market participation of the pre-transition period, and whether East German women will eventually adapt their behaviour to West German patterns, characterized by a much lower female employment rate. They found that labour force participation was negatively affected by the number of pre-school children, and that this negative effect increased over time after the unification. However, they do not use data from the period before the unification to estimate how different women's labour market behaviour was before 1990.</p><p>To our knowledge no specific study exists for Poland and in particular no comparison of pre-and post-transition female labour market behaviour has ever been carried out. In this article we ask the following questions: was motherhood in Poland a significant constraint to women's employment during transition? Was it the case before the transition? In our analysis we use panel data for both periods <ref type="bibr">(1987-1989 and 1994-1996)</ref> to disentangle the direct effect of children on female employment <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">© 2009</ref><ref type="bibr">The Authors Journal compilation © 2009</ref> The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development from women's unobserved taste for children and employment, while controlling for relevant individual and household characteristics. We will argue, based on our results, that in the pre-transition period characterized by virtually no constraints to join the labour market (no unemployment, availability of child-care facilities), preferences -including cultural attitudes and social expectations about the role of mothers in a traditional society such as Poland -played a fundamental role in shaping mothers' employment patterns. On the other hand, during transition, the need for a second earner in the household, the great uncertainty in the labour market, and (for highly educated women) the new opportunities offered by a rapidly developing private sector were powerful reasons for mothers to be in employment, and be able to overcome the increasing difficulties represented by the deterioration of child-care facilities.</p><p>The article is structured as follows: Section 1 contains an Introduction with a sub-section to provide background information to describe the position of women in the Polish labour market, as well as the family policies existing in the pretransition period and during transition. Section 2 describes the dataset used for our investigation. In Section 3 we provide some descriptive statistics on the participation and fertility behaviour of women in Poland across transition. Section 4 presents the econometric approach we adopted to estimate the female employment probability. The empirical evidence from the estimated probit models and the interpretation of the main findings are reported in Section 5. Section 6 provides concluding remarks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Background</head><p>Before 1989, despite the high female labour market participation, the absence of unemployment, and the generous provision of maternity benefits and public child care, women were in a position of disadvantage in the labour market. In a patriarchal society such as Poland, women were expected to fulfil the role of main child-care providers. At the same time, women were also expected to work in remunerative employment, both for wages needed to support their family, and because women's labour was essential to the production system in a period of rapid industrialization <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Nowakowska and Swêdrowska, 2000)</ref>. As <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Leven (2008)</ref> very effectively pointed out, gender equality was ideologically consistent with a socialist state and womenfriendly policies were mandated by a government that lacked popular support. Employed women were concentrated in low skilled and low paid occupations, despite being disproportionally highly educated. 2 Because supply of part-time jobs 2 It should be noted, however, that the pre-transition Poland had one of the lowest female activity rates of all Central and Eastern European countries. Around 1989, about 68 percent of women in 15 -54 years of age were participating in the labour force -a much lower percentage than, for example, in Czechoslovakia, the Baltic States, Belarus, Moldova, Russia, or Ukraine, all with more than 80 percent of female labour market participation. Still, women's activity rates were substantially higher in Poland than in most Western countries. More specifically, all women in the labour force were employed (unemployment being nonexistent in socialist countries) and almost all employed women were working full-time, given the negligible size of part-time employment <ref type="bibr">(UNICEF, 1999)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>© 2009 The Authors Journal compilation © 2009 The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development</head><p>was very limited in socialist countries, almost all employed women were employed full-time and the availability of child-care facilities and family-friendly policies allowed women to combine paid work and family responsibilities. However, because women were the main ones responsible for child care and the secondary earners inside the family, they had to sustain the double burden of careers and family obligations <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Ruminska-Zimny, 2002)</ref>.</p><p>During transition, activity rates dropped considerably, for both women and men. Polish women experienced a dramatic drop in employment -about 900,000 jobs were lost by women from 1989 to 1995. Unemployment, non-existent in the communist period, was 13 percent in 1997 for women of all ages, and 10 percent for men <ref type="bibr">(UNICEF, 1999)</ref>. Transition hit women in particular, not just because women were more likely to lose their job and less likely to find one -thus becoming the majority of the long-term unemployed -but also because they were systematically discriminated against in the labour market (especially in the nascent private one). <ref type="bibr">3</ref> While published statistics and empirical studies on Polish transition extensively document the changes in the social and economic position of women in general following the 1990 events, data on changes in the labour market participation of mothers are hard to find. Some evidence exists on two adverse phenomena for mothers' position in the labour market in transition Poland -the rapid increase in women's discrimination in the private labour market and the substantial decrease in public child care provision. Despite the fact that the cost of maternity leave was still fully covered by the social insurance system, employers in post-1990 Poland were reluctant to hire women who could become pregnant -either to avoid the hassle of finding a temporary replacement or due to the assumption that, once back to work after the childbearing period, mothers would become unenthusiastic workers with outdated skills <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Lohmann and Seibert, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">World Bank, 2004)</ref>. According to some studies, increasing discrimination in the private sector meant that women with children were disproportionately more likely to be out of work. A UNICEF study based on the Polish Labour Force Survey finds that 'Poland marriage status -a reliable proxy for the presence of children -was not a factor for unemployed men in finding work, but was a serious handicap for unemployed women' <ref type="bibr">(UNICEF, 1999, p. 29)</ref>. However, it should be noted that, according to the same study, the presence of children did not increase the chances of employed women losing jobs with respect to men, indicating that many women needed and were actually able to combine paid work and family commitments.</p><p>As far as the decrease in public child-care provision is concerned, it is undeniable that child-care services were severely cut during transition (especially in kindergartens), and their fees increased considerably. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Nowakowska and Swêdrowska (2000)</ref> estimate that at the end of the 1990s the typical kindergarten fee could account for 30-45 percent of an average salary of a woman with a university diploma. Some authors have stressed that, during transition, increasing costs of child care and demand-side factors were actually more important than the closure of child-care centres in explaining the decrease in enrolment rates. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Meurs and Giddings (2004)</ref> show that in the case of Bulgaria the drop in fertility rates, as well as the increase in unemployment rates and decrease in real wages -which accounted for a substantial decrease in disposable income and thus in the ability to pay for increasingly expensive child care -were the main drivers behind the decrease in enrolment rates. In Poland, some of the decrease in availability of state-subsidized child care can be explained by a drop in fertility, however the decreased supply of kindergartens and nurseries outweighed the drop in demand -the majority of kindergartens were full or above their capacity during transition <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Lohmann and Seibert, 2003)</ref>, although large geographical variations existed. In any case, it is unquestionable that the cost of raising a child increased substantially, as did the conflict between women's family duties and professional careers <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Lohmann and Seibert, 2003)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> The lack of adequate and affordable child-care services together with labour market discrimination could have 'encouraged' women to drop out of the labour force to raise children. On the other hand, women's dependency on their spouses' and other family members' income as well as their increased inability to return to paid work after long spells out of the labour force 5 were powerful reasons for mothers with a job to stay employed, even at the cost of exceptional efforts to juggle work and family responsibilities. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> Which of the above contrasting forces prevailed in shaping employment opportunities for mothers during transition is an open question. In addition, it is unclear whether having children affected women's participation in the labour market more during transition than in the pre-transition period. We will explore these issues in the current analysis. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> It should be stressed that, while child-care provision suffered substantial cuts during transition, the duration of maternity leave and the amount of maternity benefits were maintained at the pre-transition levels. Mothers were paid a basic maternity benefit corresponding to 100 percent wage replacement for 16, 18, or 26 weeks after delivery (of the first child, any subsequent children, or in case of multiple births, respectively) and, if employed, were entitled to unpaid parental leave until the third birthday of the child, while retaining the right to their previous job <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Golinowska et al. , 2003)</ref>. Until 1996, the last year of our sample data, these provisions remained unchanged, and are therefore not responsible for changes in women's labour supply which we may observe between the two periods. Overall, means-tested and insurance-based family benefits characterized Poland as one of the least generous countries in the pre-transition Central and Eastern Europe <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Fodor et al. , 2002)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> In 1997, the female unemployment rate was 13 percent, and almost half of unemployed women (43 percent) were long-term unemployed (out of work for longer than one year) (UNICEF, 1999). <ref type="bibr">6</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Rostgaard (2004)</ref> comments that the high cost of child care and the policy of means-tested cash benefits '. . . runs the risk of encouraging low-income women to withdraw from the labour market to care for their children at home, while high-income women are likely to combine work and caring responsibilities because they can better afford costly day care' (p. 34). However -referring to evidence provided by Kurzynowski - <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Golinowska et al. (2003)</ref> claim that '. . . In the late 1990s, women with low-paid but permanent jobs tended to take parental leave and claim parental allowance over four times less frequently than at the time the benefit was introduced' (p. 26).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Data</head><p>To answer these questions we use the panel data for Poland available in the Panel Comparability Project (PACO) -the original source is the Polish Household Panel (PHP) survey. 7 PACO is an international comparative database provided by CEPS/ INSTEAD (based in Luxembourg) integrating micro-data from various national household panels over a large number of years. <ref type="bibr">8</ref> For Poland, the available data consist of two separate panels: the first includes four waves from 1987 to 1990, the second includes three waves from 1994 to 1996. Although the individuals observed are not the same in the pre-and post-transition period, we can still exploit all the advantages of using panel data to estimate a model of mothers' employment and compare the results in the two periods. The main advantages of using the Polish datasets through PACO are the consistency of variable definition over time (the original variables have been standardized and codified according to standardized international classifications), and (potentially) the comparability of the results with other countries included in the database (Hungary, among transitional economies, and some West-European economies like Germany and the UK). Moreover, in the case of Poland, PACO includes two panels, one covering the pre-reform period and the other covering the transition period -overall a relatively long time span that allows for comparisons before and after the reform.</p><p>The data comprises extensive information on labour force and work history (employment status, professional status, working time, sector of employment), and includes a set of household-and individual-level income variables, education and family background variables, household composition and demographic characteristics of each individual, and territorial division. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table A1</ref> in the Appendix presents summary statistics for the main variables used in this study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Female labour supply and fertility in Poland</head><p>Using the Polish Household Panel in PACO we start by providing some stylized facts about the employment and fertility behaviour of Polish women. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref> shows the proportion of women aged 16-44 years with a partner 9 and household responsibilities (namely, who are either head of the household or the spouse of the</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>© 2009 The Authors Journal compilation © 2009 The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development</head><p>head) who were in employment in the period before the transition <ref type="bibr">(1987)</ref><ref type="bibr">(1988)</ref><ref type="bibr">(1989)</ref> and during transition <ref type="bibr">(1994)</ref><ref type="bibr">(1995)</ref><ref type="bibr">(1996)</ref>, by age of the youngest child. It should be stressed that the first period panel made available through PACO also includes 1990, but we chose to drop this last wave given that reforms in Poland were adopted starting from the 1 January 1990 (Poland is probably the best-known application of the 'shock therapy' among the newly emerging economies of Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union). We chose 16-44 years as the relevant age interval to account for the existence of a non-zero percentage of very young mothers (lower bound); the upper threshold of 44 is typically chosen as the oldest fertile age in studies on fertility behaviour. 10 <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref> shows a very interesting and unexpected pattern. For women aged 16-44 years the employment rate dropped very little, on average from 69 percent in the first period to 67 percent in the second period. However, the employment rate of mothers varied substantially depending on the age of the youngest child; moreover, the patterns were quite different in the two periods. Before the transition, only 41 percent of women with a child aged 0-2 years were employed, compared with 68 percent of mothers of a youngest child aged 3-5 years, and 79 percent of mothers of a youngest child aged 6-11 years. 11 During transition, the employment rate of mothers also increased with the age of the youngest child, but the differences were much less pronounced. Thus, a higher percentage of mothers of a child aged 0-2 years were employed than before the transition -50 vs. 41 percent. However, only 59 percent of mothers of a youngest child aged 3-5 years and 71 percent of mother of a youngest child aged 6-11 years were employed during transition (while the corresponding pre-transition figures were 68 and 79 percent).</p><p>To some extent, the decline in labour market participation of mothers of pre-school children (3-5 years old) can be accounted for by the decline in statesubsidized child-care. Children aged 3-5 years were much more likely to be in kindergarten before than during transition, and even before transition much more likely to be in child care than children aged 0 -2 years old. The largest difference in the employment rate before and during transition existed for the group of women without dependent children, 87 vs. 73 percent. However, the surprising finding is the comparatively large percentage of mothers of children aged 0-2 years old who were employed during transition -larger than in the first period. These patterns suggest that there were substantial differences in the probability of women to be employed between the two periods that were unrelated to motherhood (as illustrated by the differences in employment rates for women without dependent children between <ref type="bibr">the 1987-1989 and the 1994-1996 periods)</ref>.</p><p>The stylized facts presented in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref> also suggest that the presence and the age of children was a crucial element in explaining women's employment before transition rather than during transition. That is, during transition the female employment rate was much less responsive to the age of the youngest child than it was before transition. This is in contrast with the general notion of universal female labour market participation before transition (which, in the case of Poland, was less than universal) and the foreseeable negative impact on mothers' employment during transition due to the deterioration of child-care facilities, as well as the increased discrimination in the private labour market. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref> shows the employment rates of women by age of the youngest child but does not take into account the total fertility and the changes in fertility patterns between the two periods. It can be argued that fertility is endogenous to labour supply -in fact, fertility rates dropped during transition and postponement of marriage and childbearing became one of the strategies to decrease the conflict between family commitments and paid work <ref type="bibr">(UNICEF, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Lohmann and</ref><ref type="bibr">© 2009 The Authors Journal compilation © 2009</ref> The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development <ref type="bibr">Siebert, 2003)</ref>. Therefore, the large differences in employment rates of mothers with children of different ages observed before the transition could have been driven by a total higher fertility. This is to say that the age of the youngest child heavily influenced the employment rate of the mother due to the presence of more siblings in the first period than in the second period. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> shows that, if there is some validity in this explanation, it is very limited.</p><p>The average number of children generally decreased between the two periods, but not dramatically so (the decrease in fertility patterns accelerated in the late 1990s, that is, after the period considered in this study). For example, the average number of children aged 0-2 years for each woman aged 16-44 years was not much lower in the second period when, as <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref> shows, the employment rates of mothers of these very young children was 8 percentage points higher in 1994-1996. Moreover, <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> also shows that the difference in the average number of children between working and non-working women was lower in the second than in the first period for the children aged 0-2 and 3-5 years. Therefore, the stylized facts presented in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref> do not seem to be driven by dramatic changes in fertility behaviour.</p><p>Another element that should not be overlooked in this analysis is the role of educational qualification. Women with different education levels are likely to have different attitudes toward employment and were also affected differently by labour market changes during transition. In <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> we show the proportion of women in  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref>, both before and after transition, mothers had lower employment rates than non-mothers or mothers of children aged 18 years or older. Moreover, the younger the age of the youngest child, the lower the employment rate of the mother. This pattern was common across education levels, although some important differences should be stressed.</p><p>First, highly educated mothers (third level education) 12 had substantially higher employment rates than mothers of children of the same age but with lower educational qualifications in both periods. Moreover, highly educated women re-entered employment when the child was still very young -the employment rates of highly educated mothers with a child aged 3-5 years was over 80 percent both before and after transition. Second, the transition does not seem to have affected the employment rate of mothers as much as it affected the employment rate of non-mothers. While women with non-dependent or no children had substantially lower employment rates in the period 1994 -1996 than they had in the period 1987 -1989 at almost all educational qualifications, the employment rate of mothers was lower in the post-transition period but not by the same large amounts and in the case of mothers of children aged 0-2 years it actually increased during transition. An age effect is likely to drive this result -transition negatively affected older women more than it did younger women.</p><p>Third, women were differently affected by the drop in employment rates during transition depending on their educational qualifications. Highly educated women (with third level education) who were mothers did not experience any drop in employment rates, while the employment rate of non-mothers of the same educational level decreased in the second period. Women with lower educational qualifications (mothers and non-mothers), by contrast, generally experienced large drops in employment rates, the exception being the mothers of children aged 2 years and younger. It seems therefore that the education level was a key factor in explaining employment outcomes following transition, more than having or not having children.</p><p>Finally, <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref> shows the employment rates of married women depending on the participation in employment of their partner. Before transition -when the employment rate of men and women was very high -having a partner out of employment was associated with a very high employment participation of the wife, while women with a working partner were less likely to work. This could be due to a genuine effect of the husband's employment status on his wife's employment status (compatible with the added worker effect, as well as with the effect produced by an increase in the household non-earned income on the woman's labour supply). Interestingly, after transition, the difference in the employment rates of the two groups of women is reversed, and having a partner out of employment is associated with a lower probability that the wife is employed. During this period, the employment rate of men also dropped; therefore it is much more common to observe couples where both partners do not work. These patterns suggest that the higher-than-expected participation in employment of mothers (especially of young children) in transition Poland is probably not driven by the spouse being unemployed or inactive. At the same time, the differences between the two periods in the employment behaviour of the two partners suggest that it is important to control for the spouse's characteristics in the multivariate analysis, to account for a certain degree of heterogeneity among women (women whose partner is in employment are likely to be different from women whose partner is out of work). <ref type="bibr">13</ref> In the multivariate analysis we will explore more rigorously the candidate explanations put forward in the descriptive analysis presented in this section. In particular, we will account for the possibility that fertility and participation in employment are simultaneously determined. Moreover, we will control for the partner's characteristics, in particular his employment status and level of earnings. Finally, we will control for a host of personal and household characteristics of the woman, in particular to address the possibility of correlation between level of education and presence and age of children. It should be noted that the model we estimated and present in the next section is a reduced form, which does not allow disentangling supply-and demand-side effects. Despite this limitation, it can give a good indication of whether any of the explanations put forward thus far is a plausible one.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Econometric modelling</head><p>The study of female labour supply and its correlation with the presence of young children has a long tradition in the applied econometric literature. Two exhaustive surveys are given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Browning (1992)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Nakamura and Nakamura (1992)</ref>. These articles review the main issues concerning the estimation of the effects of the presence of children on women's labour supply and examine some select studies on this topic. The vast majority of the empirical studies find a negative correlation between fertility and women's labour supply. However, the interpretation of this result must consider a number of issues. The existence of heterogeneity among women, differing in their fixed unobserved preferences for work and children, introduces selection effects that can bias 'genuine' effects. For example, it could be that women with a higher 'taste' for children are those with lower unobservable abilities and skills in the labour market. In that case, it would be this selection effect to drive the observed association between a higher number of children and lower labour market participation, rather than a 'true' causal effect due to discrimination</p></div>

Availability of panel data in the more recent empirical investigations of female labour supply allows for a proper consideration of unobserved heterogeneity. However, when this womanspecific time invariant component is correlated with the desired number of children, a problem of endogeneity of the fertility variables arises. A possible approach to this problem is to follow <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Chamberlain (1984)</ref> and parametrically specify the individual unobserved heterogeneity allowing for correlation with the observed fertility variables. We follow this suggestion in our empirical analysis, given the major problems characterizing alternative solutions, like the Instrumental Variable (IV) estimation. 14 Such an approach allows for simultaneous correlation between fertility and labour supply behaviour, but still rests on the strict exogeneity assumption, ruling out any correlation pattern between fertility and past and future working status, and thus a possible feedback from past employment on future fertility. Given the difficulties arising from relaxing the strict exogeneity assumption, we will follow <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Wooldridge (2002)</ref> and run a test to get some evidence on its plausibility in our specific application.</p><p>A related important feature to consider and understand women's employment behaviour has to do with the inter-temporal nature of labour supply. There is evidence of a high degree of serial persistence in individual participation decisions, possibly due to state dependence (with current participation depending on past participation) and persistent heterogeneity (when the unobserved individual component determines current participation irrespective of past participation). As a consequence, econometric models of female labour supply should explicitly include dynamic factors. Recent studies by <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Hyslop (1999)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Troske and Voicu (2004)</ref> adopt a dynamic framework to evaluate the interaction between fertility and labour supply decisions. Unfortunately, this approach is not viable in our case, given that the two panels we use are too short. <ref type="bibr">15</ref> In the following sub-section we present the empirical strategy we adopted for our analysis, which is based on static models, but fully exploits the panel dimension of our dataset.</p></div>

These selection criteria left us with a sample of 3,056 person-waves in the first panel <ref type="bibr">(period 1987-1989)</ref>, and 5,055 person-waves in the second panel <ref type="bibr">(period 1994-1996)</ref>.</p><p>We defined participation as the status of being employed, in a similar way to the more recent empirical studies of female labour force participation (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Hyslop, 1999)</ref>, and modelled the binary indicator (employed/not employed) by means of probit models. As a starting point and benchmark for our analysis, we considered two classical models: the pooled cross-section probit and the random effects (RE) panel probit model.</p><p>The cross-section (CS) probit model ignores the repeated observations on the same individuals, and can be sketched in terms of a continuous latent variable as:</p><p>( <ref type="formula">1)</ref>where i = 1, . . . N ; t = 1, . . . T , with the binary dependent variable indicating participation given by the indicator function:</p><p>. The vector x it contains observed human capital, demographic, household structure and other variables which may affect the participation decision, while u it captures the effects of unobserved factors and it is assumed to be I.I.D. standard normal. Accordingly, the likelihood function of the CS probit model is built on the assumption that: with Φ (.) denoting the standard normal cumulative density function. The RE probit model splits the error term into a time invariant individual random effect and an idiosyncratic random error:</p><p>(2) with ε it ~ I.I.D <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">.

The presence of such a time invariant component implies a non-diagonal covariance matrix of the composite error term u it = α i + ε it , with , and , interpretable as the proportion of the overall error variance which is explained by the individual effect. The likelihood function of the RE probit model relies on the probabilities: <ref type="bibr">16</ref> The PACO dataset only records the relationship of household members with respect to the head of the household. We assume that the children of the household head are automatically children of the spouse of the household head or have the same effect on her labour market behaviour as her own children.  Integrating out the unobservable component introduces an integral of the above probabilities in each individual contribution to the sample likelihood function.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">* = ′ + + β α ε α σ α i i X N ~ ( , ) | 0 2 Var( ) u it = + σ α 2 1 ρ σ σ α α ( ) /( ) = = + Corr u u it is 2 2 1 © 2009</formula><p>Estimation by maximum likelihood of both models can be automatically implemented in STATA, although the maximization of the likelihood function of the second model requires the evaluation of an integral by Gaussian Quadrature <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Butler and Moffitt, 1982</ref>). The first model ignores individual heterogeneity and does not exploit the repeated observation available on the same woman. The inference requires the use of a robust covariance matrix to take into account the error serial correlation induced by the unobserved individual component not varying with time.</p><p>The second model allows us to incorporate the individual unobserved effects, which is generally found to represent a very substantial component in estimated female labour participation equations <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Hyslop, 1999</ref>, finds that the individualspecific RE accounts for 78 percent of the latent error variance) but relies on two main assumptions: (i) absence of correlation between the individual heterogeneity and the regressors, (ii) strict exogeneity of the explanatory variables conditionally on the individual heterogeneity component. Whenever either of these hypotheses fails, the estimates we obtain for the effects of the children on labour supply are not consistent (notice that in this instance the pooled probit would suffer from the same problem). We addressed the first limitation by adopting as a final specification a correlated random effect (CRE) probit model, which allows the unobserved preferences for working to be correlated with observed fertility. We followed <ref type="bibr">Chamberlain's suggestion (1984)</ref> and postulated:</p><p>(3)</p><p>where: z i denotes the time average, t = 1, . . .

The educational qualification of the woman is included using a set of dummies indicating the highest level of education attained. The woman's age is included in quadratic form. To control for household income that might affect the woman's labour supply, we inserted a dummy for her partner being employed and used available information on his personal earnings 17 as well as his age and education. A dummy indicating house ownership is meant to proxy for other nonlabour income. Completed fertility is represented by a set of variables indicating the number of children in different age categories (0-2, 3-5, 6-11, and 12-17).</p><p>17 About 14 percent of the working partners reported zero earnings (zero or negative in the second period).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Results</head><p>In Tables A2 and A3 in the Appendix we report the estimation results for the two periods: 1987-1989 (pre-transition) and 1994-1996 (transition period). For each period, we present three sets of results corresponding to the pooled CS probit model (equation 1), the RE probit model (equation 2), and the CRE probit model (equations 2 and 3).</p><p>Before discussing the evidence we obtained on the determinants of women's employment in the two periods, we show that the panel probit models represent an improvement over the benchmark pooled CS specification. First, the estimated value ⁄ within the RE and CRE specification is about 0.80, and statistically significant in both periods. This result shows that the relative importance of the unobserved effect is very high and that allowing for unobserved heterogeneity represents an important improvement of the model (the huge increase in the log-likelihood with respect to the pooled CS specification supports this conclusion).</p><p>Some of the CRE coefficients (the elements of the parameter vector ξ) of the variables entering the expected value of the unobserved effect are statistically significant in both periods. We are also able to reject in both periods the null hypothesis that all the ξ elements are simultaneously equal to zero, although with weaker evidence in the second period. This evidence supports the existence of simultaneous correlation between the individual effect and the fertility variables.</p><p>As mentioned before, the hypothesis of strict exogeneity of the included regressors is maintained in all the estimated models. We follow <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Wooldridge (2002)</ref> and test for this hypothesis by inserting the one-year forwarded fertility variables on the right-hand side and testing whether their coefficients are jointly equal to zero. The results of the tests are reported in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table A4</ref> in the Appendix. Interestingly, the</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>© 2009 The Authors Journal compilation © 2009 The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development</head><p>hypothesis could not be rejected for both panel data models within the CRE framework. This indicates that the specified correlation between the fertility variables and the individual unobserved heterogeneity is able to capture at least part of the mechanism generating a feedback effect from past participation to future fertility behaviour, although we cannot claim that the validity of our estimation results is free from any threat due to endogeneity of the fertility variable. In particular, in case of (neglected) feedback from past employment to current fertility, the coefficients of the fertility variable are likely to suffer from an attenuation bias, as it is reasonable to argue that past participation is positively related to both current fertility and participation. With this caveat in mind, we can nevertheless look at the general pattern displayed by the estimated coefficients of the fertility variables -the key variables of interest in our analysis -and observe that they are negative in both the pre-reform and transition period (that is, having children negatively impacts the probability of working, as expected). Not surprisingly, the size of this effect decreases as the age of the child increases, indicating that a lower amount of mother's time is needed for child-care of older children. <ref type="bibr">19</ref> The most striking pattern emerging from our results is the decrease in the absolute value of the coefficients of the fertility variables moving from the first to the second period, for all three models. Within the CRE model, while in the first period all the fertility variables have significant coefficients, during the transition period the only significant effect is associated with the presence of very young children (aged 0-2 years). The pattern presented in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref> and discussed in the descriptive analysis is therefore confirmed, even after controlling for the potential endogeneity of fertility, and all the relevant personal and household characteristics of the woman, including the characteristics of her partner.</p><p>To analyze the numerical effect of the presence of children on employment outcomes we present in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 4</ref> a set of estimated average probabilities of working and average partial effects evaluated with the three models. More precisely, we look at the absolute and percentage change in the (average population) probability of working observed when each observed woman moves from the condition of childless woman to that of mother of a young child (aged 0-2 years). The descriptive analysis of Section 3 suggests looking at this impact by level of education.</p><p>The comparison between the two periods confirms the smaller effect in the second period, occurring (with different magnitude) at all levels of education. This pattern is common to the three estimated models, although it can be observed that <ref type="bibr">19</ref> We incidentally note that within the RE model the estimated coefficients of the fertility variables are higher in absolute value than those obtained within the pooled CS model. This pattern suggests that the unobservable characteristics affect positively both the probability of employment and the realized fertility. The CRE children's coefficients are smaller than the RE children's coefficients; the coefficients that are most affected when changing the estimation technique are those of the dummies indicating the presence of very young children (number of children aged 0 -2 and 3 -5 years). This suggests that it is the presence of very young children that is most likely correlated with the mother's taste for work -a very plausible result.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>© 2009 The Authors Journal compilation © 2009 The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development</head><p>the results obtained from Pooled CS are rather different from those of the RE and CRE models, which are instead similar to each other. Before the transition to a market economy, women with low or professional education were the most penalized by the presence of a young child. Being highly educated was associated with a lower but still sizable percentage drop in the probability of working with respect to childless women. Similarly, during the transition period, the biggest effects -in absolute terms -were estimated for women with low or professional education, while the likelihood of employment of women with high educational qualifications was less affected by the presence of a young child. These results confirm that the educational level was a key dimension affecting employment after transition, eventually more important than family circumstances. There is abundant evidence that during transition the increase in unemployment hit the lowest educated people in particular, 20 while the demand for employees with high level of human capital increased steadily. <ref type="bibr">21</ref> On the other hand, the demand for employees with primary or incomplete primary education, and for graduates from postsecondary schools declined significantly <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Kwiatkowski, Socha and Sztanderska, 2001</ref>).</p><p>Our main finding of a smaller impact of having children on the probability of employment in the second period was confirmed in the multivariate analysis; this implies that it cannot be assigned to any of the factors that were accounted for in the regressions. According to our results, the increasing difficulty of combining family and work during transition does not result in a lower participation probability of mothers with respect to the pre-transition period, despite a decrease in state-subsidized child-care (or the negative effect of the decrease in child-care is totally compensated by forces of opposite sign). None of the variables included in the model (women's age and education, partner's employment status, earnings of the partner, area characteristics) can reverse the finding of a smaller (in absolute value) effect of children in the second than in the first period, nor can the fact of having allowed for endogenous fertility using the CRE model. But what other potential explanations that are not captured by our model can explain this finding?</p><p>There are essentially two categories of explanations that can be put forward at this point. A first possibility could be that there is some omitted variable from our regressions, and that this(these) variable(s) -correlated with being a mother of children of different age groups -is (are) the 'true' explanation(s) of mothers' labour supply either before or during transition or both. For example, an increase in part-time employment in the transition period could explain why mothers were more likely to be employed -availability of part-time employment usually mitigates the negative effect of children on women's labour supply. Unfortunately we do not have information of whether employment was part-time or full-time, so we cannot control for this variable. However, there is evidence of no increase in part-time job opportunities in the second period; data provided by enterprises indicate instead that a slight drop in the share of part-time employment occurred, from about 10 percent before transition to 8.8 percent in 1998 <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Kwiatkowski, Socha and Sztanderska, 2001)</ref>. Also, we do not have information on women's earnings and other nonearned income. It is possible that during transition mothers were pressured to stay in employment (if they had a job) or to take up employment because of the powerful, negative income effect produced by the drop in real wages (theirs and their husband's).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>© 2009 The Authors Journal compilation © 2009 The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development</head><p>The second type of explanation is that the coefficients of the children dummies are 'true' effects, that is they capture real preferences, attitudes, or individual or social constraints that cannot be incorporated into the regressions. We can think of reasons why mothers in the transition period may have had an incentive to remain in the labour market. The change in the general economic environment represented by the transition to a market economy was characterized by tremendous adjustments and restructuring, high layoff rates and low re-employment rates. The resulting uncertainty in the labour market could have represented a powerful incentive for women to work despite the presence of young children. Moreover, in the first period, despite labour market constraints (including no unemployment) being much lower and women's labour market participation rate being higher, the traditional role of caregiver assigned to women represented a powerful disincentive for mothers of young children to join the labour market.</p><p>Finally, the two phenomena that lead us to expect a stronger disadvantage for mothers in the second period -increasing labour market discrimination and substantial cuts in child-care facilities -may have been overemphasized as far as their effects on the labour market participation of mothers of young children are concerned. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Lohmann and Seibert (2003)</ref> report that, during transition, employers preferred women aged 25 -35 years over older women. The reasons for this preference probably being that younger women are better educated, better able to adapt to a free market economy, more likely to master ICTs and foreign languages, and also more physically attractive. That is, as much as employers may have disliked the possibility that these women could become mothers, there were plenty of advantages in hiring younger rather than older women that compensated for the risk of the employee becoming pregnant. On the other hand, younger women, many of them highly educated, were eager to stay in employment even after the birth of a child to make the most of career opportunities that were much more exciting than in the pre-transition period. As for child-care provision, while it dramatically decreased during the 1990s and its cost soared, this was much less the case for nurseries, which were very few even before transition. In general, child care was not adequate before transition and was less widespread than in other countries of the former Socialist Block, especially in rural areas. As a matter of fact, only 4 percent of children below 3 years were enrolled in day nurseries in the 1980s. <ref type="bibr">22</ref> Interestingly, a demographic study on the propensity of becoming a mother before 1989 reaches conclusions that are coherent with our findings. In comparing first-birth intensity in Hungary and Poland during state socialism, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Oláh and Fratczak (2004)</ref> find that in Poland, where the family policies were less generous than in Hungary, the propensity to become a mother was reduced for employed women. Although they investigate fertility choices (rather than labour supply behaviour), one of their main findings is that the combination of full-time employment © 2009 The Authors Journal compilation © 2009 The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and family responsibilities was more difficult in pre-transition Poland than in Hungary. 23</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Concluding remarks</head><p>In this article we have analyzed the relationship between motherhood and employment probabilities of Polish women before and during transition using panel data for the periods of <ref type="bibr">1987-1989 and 1994 -1996</ref>. Before transition, despite the very high female participation in employment, Polish mothers -especially mothers of young children -were substantially less likely to work than childless women. During transition, to our surprise, the negative effect of motherhood was substantially lower than in the pre-transition period. In the multivariate analysis, a significant coefficient was estimated only for mothers of children aged 0-2 years old and even in this case the average population effect turned out to be much smaller than in the pre-transition period. This result goes in the opposite direction to what one would have expected, based on the common notions of very high female labour market participation in the communist Poland, sustained by the existence of family-friendly policies and a publicly-funded affordable network of child-care facilities, which were dismantled during transition, making women's participation in employment theoretically more difficult.</p><p>Our findings are not driven by a change in the association of the 'taste for children' and the 'taste for employment' in the two periods, because our estimates -obtained with CRE panel probit models -control for unobserved heterogeneity in the two samples. The most plausible interpretation is that, before transition, in absence of constraints in accessing the labour market, women could realize their preferences for lower employment in coincidence of motherhood or were 'forced' out of work by the expectations of a traditional society that required mothers (especially of very young children) to be the primary caretakers of their children. At the same time, although child-care services were much more affordable before than during transition, in the pre-1989 Poland availability of child care was already a problem, especially for very young children and in the rural areas of the country. On the other hand, during transition, the uncertainty in the labour market, the process of restructuring, the necessity of relying on two earners in the household, the need (and desire) of not being cut out of new job opportunities in the growing private sector, and the gloomy perspective of long-term unemployment after a prolonged period out of the labour market could have represented more powerful 'pushing' factors for women to work than the disincentive produced by the deterioration of child-care facilities. This is not to say that women were not experiencing growing difficulties in combining paid work and family responsibilities, © 2009 The Authors Journal compilation © 2009 The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development nor that this conflict was without potentially negative consequences for women's employment. It rather stresses how powerful were constraints other than the decrease in child-care availability (many of them on the demand-side) in shaping women's employment opportunities during transition. <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Development   Table A4</ref>.

			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="3">For an overview of women's position in the labour market in pre-transition Poland and the changes that occurred during transition see<ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Lohmann and Seibert (2003)</ref> and<ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Paci (2002)</ref>.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="7">The PHP is managed by the Department of Economics at the University of Warsaw in Poland. The LFS (which includes a panel component) could have been an appropriate choice for our study, but it only started in 1992, and was therefore not available in the pre-transition period. 8 For more information about PACO, see website &lt;www.ceps.lu.paco/acceuil.cfm&gt;.9  In this article we do not distinguish between married and cohabiting women and we may use the words 'partner', 'spouse' and 'husband' (or 'wife') interchangeably.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="10">Moreover, we focused on women who were either the head or the spouse because it was only possible for this group of women to unambiguously identify their own child from other children living in the household. See footnote 16.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="11">Variations in women's employment rates are expected to be independent of variations in family policies, given that no change occurred over the whole period considered in our analysis (in particular, the duration of maternity and parental leave was the same in1987-1990 and 1994 -1996).</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="12">Third level education (or tertiary education, or higher education) refers to universities and other tertiary institutions that award degrees and advanced research qualifications as well as to other post-secondary institutions that also provide programs that would be classified at a lower level than a degree.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot">Notes: (i) Women with household responsibilities are defined as those who are either the head of household or the spouse of the head. (ii) Standard deviations in brackets.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="13">In a previous version of this article we estimated the model only for the sample of women whose partner is employed, obtaining very similar results to those presented here using the broader sample.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="18">As one of the referees correctly pointed out, voivodships do not necessarily fully control for the availability of child-care facilities. Child-care can vary within a voivodship; in particular, it can be more available in urban than in rural areas. Unfortunately, we do not have any information about whether the woman resides in an urban or rural area. Still, the use of voivodship dummies allows us to (partially) control for local labour market conditions and, to some extent, availability of infrastructures, including child-care.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="20">Among the unemployed, the majority had only primary (33.4 percent) or basic vocational (37 percent) educational qualifications, while only 2.5 percent of the unemployed were graduates of universities<ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Kowalska, 2002)</ref>.21  In the period 1994 -1998, the employment of Polish people with higher education rose the fastest, by 29.1 percent, while for those with secondary vocational education rose by almost 17 percent.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="23">They estimate that in Poland housewives and part-time employed women had more than 30 percent higher propensity to have a first child than childless women working full-time.</note>
