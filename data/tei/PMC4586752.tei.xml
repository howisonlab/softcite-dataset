Some cell lines fail to yield terminally differentiated cells at subsequent stages of differentiation <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Tabar and Studer, 2014)</ref>. These limitations in the ability to systematically differentiate hPSC lines into desired lineages substantially restrict their utility for cell replacement therapy and disease modeling, as moving stem cell-based therapies to patients will require the ability to differentiate all cell lines.</p><p>Here, we show that PP1, a Src tyrosine kinase inhibitor, regulates the retinoblastoma protein (Rb) and cell cycle of hPSCs, enriches cells in the early G1 phase, and improves their multilineage differentiation potential. Importantly, the PP1 treatment yields high differentiation efficiencies even in cell lines that have low differentiation propensities under control conditions. We demonstrate these effects in both human embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines. Furthermore, we show that Src plays an important regulatory role in this process, as genetic suppression of Src regulates Rb activity and enhances the differentiation potential of hPSCs.</p><p>Our focus on PP1 and Src was motivated by the finding that the embryonic cell cycle lengthens to incorporate gap phases as it transitions from a proliferative stage to a stage governed by cell fate decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Trelstad et al., 1967;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Hartwell and Weinert, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Murray and Kirschner, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Frederick and Andrews, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Edgar and Lehner, 1996)</ref>. One mechanism that plays a critical role in maintaining cell proliferation at the early developmental stages is Src tyrosine kinase signaling <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Frame, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Segawa et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Kim et al., 2009)</ref>. High protein tyrosine kinase activity is required for the early developmental events that occur before cell fate specification <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Imamoto and Soriano, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Livingston et al., 1998)</ref>. Analogous to early development, Src activity is elevated in proliferating PSCs <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Annerén et al., 2004)</ref>, potentially preventing the lengthening of the cell cycle for differentiation and cell fate specification. We therefore hypothesized that inhibiting Src activity might regulate the cell cycle and improve the differentiation propensity of hPSCs.</p><p>In previous work, we showed that treatment of hPSCs with DMSO improves differentiation propensity after directed differentiation <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Chetty et al., 2013)</ref>. The present study provides a new tool to improve differentiation and strengthens the case that manipulating the cell cycle is critical for improving directed differentiation. The mechanistic results presented here indicate that Src plays an important regulatory role in controlling cell fate decisions of hPSCs.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PP1 treatment improves the differentiation capacity of hPSCs in a dose-dependent manner</head><p>Src-tyrosine kinase signaling regulates cell growth and proliferation of various cell types, including PSCs <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Annerén et al., 2004)</ref>, cancer cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Frame, 2002)</ref>, and normal somatic cells Driving human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) into specific lineages is an inefficient and challenging process. We show that a potent Src inhibitor, PP1, regulates expression of genes involved in the G1 to S phase transition of the cell cycle, activates proteins in the retinoblastoma family, and subsequently increases the differentiation propensities of hPSCs into all three germ layers. We further demonstrate that genetic suppression of Src regulates the activity of the retinoblastoma protein and enhances the differentiation potential of hPSCs across all germ layers. These positive effects extend beyond the initial germ layer specification and enable efficient differentiation at subsequent stages of differentiation.</p><p>A Src inhibitor regulates the cell cycle of human pluripotent stem cells and improves directed differentiation <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Playford and Schaller, 2004)</ref>. In most cell types, Src is negatively regulated (held in an inactive state), but in PSCs and cancer cells, Src activity is elevated <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Frame, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Annerén et al., 2004)</ref>. PP1 ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 1 A)</ref> has been shown to effectively block Src activity and the proliferation of many types of tumorigenic cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Hanke et al., 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bain et al., 2007)</ref>. We tested whether inhibition of Src signaling by PP1 treatment affects the differentiation capacity of hPSCs. We focused on the hPSC line HUES6, a cell line with a 24-h doubling time that does not exhibit bias toward any particular lineage and is representative of cell lines with relatively low efficiencies of differentiation <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Cowan et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Osafune et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bock et al., 2011)</ref>. To enhance therapeutic utility, differenti-ations were performed under low-serum conditions. After a 24-h treatment with PP1 at different doses, HUES6 cells were cultured in differentiation media with Wnt3a and Activin A for 24 h, then assessed for the percentage of cells that differentiated into Brachyury (Brachy)+ cells, a marker for mesendoderm and an early marker for differentiation ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 1 B)</ref>.</p><p>A 24-h treatment with PP1 increased the percentage as well as the total number of cells that differentiated compared with untreated control cells in a dose-dependent manner ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>, C-F). At dosages of 25-50 µM, the percentage of cells differentiating into Brachy+ cells reached nearly 50%, an ∼300-fold enhancement relative to control cells. In all conditions, cells that did not differentiate retained the <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. PP1 treatment improves the differentiation capacity of hPSCs in a dose-dependent manner.

Because a 25-µM PP1 treatment maximizes the percentage and total number of differentiated cells, we used this as an optimal dosage in subsequent analyses. Improvements in differentiation capacity were also observed in other human embryonic and iPSC lines after a 24-h PP1 (25 µM) treatment <ref type="figure">(Fig. 2)</ref>. These improvements were driven by an enhanced competency for differentiation; across all cell lines, the rate of cell death did not differ sig-nificantly between the two groups ( <ref type="figure">Fig. S1</ref>; P = 0.3 Annexin+/ PI−; P = 0.1 Annexin+/PI+).</p><p>The change in intercellular morphology with exposure to PP1 is consistent with the effects of Src activity on cell-cell adhesion <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Frame, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Playford and Schaller, 2004)</ref>.

Treatment durations that were shorter than the cell line's doubling time induced only a 2-5% differentiation rate (unpublished data).</p><p>Among the inhibitors tested, PP1 proved to be the most effective in enhancing differentiation potential. Consistent with prior reports, treatment of hPSCs with other inhibitors to perturb various cell cycle-related kinase signaling pathways had a minimal or moderate effect on improving differentiation potential <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Smith, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Orford and Scadden, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Li and Kirschner, 2014)</ref>. Treatment with a Cdk2 inhibitor at 5-10 µM induced ∼20% of the cells to differentiate into Brachy+ cells but was associated with a substantial degree of cell loss at higher doses <ref type="figure">(Fig. S2</ref>, A-I).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PP1 treatment regulates the cell cycle and activity of Rb in hPSCs</head><p>Given that the PP1 treatment effectively enhances differentiation potential at the 24 h time point, we treated hPSCs with 25 µM PP1 for 24 h and investigated the effects on the cell cycle. Cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry showed that the PP1 treatment changes the distribution of hPSCs in the G1, S, and G2/M phases of the cell cycle, increasing the proportion of cells in G1 and decreasing the number of cells in the S and G2/M phases. These effects were consistently observed in several human embryonic and iPSC lines (Figs. 3, 4 A, and S3). Further investigation of the HUES6 cell line showed that a 24-h treatment with 25 µM PP1 nearly doubles the percentage of cells in G1 phase (∼70%) compared with controls (∼35%; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 4 B)</ref>. The proportion of cells in the S and G2/M phases is concomitantly reduced by at least twofold after the PP1 treatment ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 4 B)</ref>. A significant shift toward G1 was observed across all cell lines ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 3</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. S3</ref>; P &lt; 0.002).</p><p>Rb predominantly remains in an inactive hyperphosphorylated state throughout the cell cycle of human and mouse PSCs. While phosphorylated Rb promotes cell division, the accumulation of hypophosphorylated Rb (active Rb) is associated with an enrichment of cells in the early G1 phase of the cell cycle and an improved capacity for differentiation <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Buchkovich et al., 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Chen et al., 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Orford and Scadden, 2008)</ref>. We assessed the phosphorylation status of Rb in control and 25 µM PP1-treated hPSCs. After a 24-h PP1 treatment, the percentage of hPSCs expressing hypophosphorylated Rb increased by &gt;60-fold from 0.3% to 20% <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 4</ref>, C and D). Phosphorylation of Rb occurs at 16 distinct sites <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Harbour and Dean, 2000)</ref>. Assessment of the inactive phosphorylated status of Rb at one of these sites (serine 780) showed that PP1 treatment leads to a twofold reduction in the percentage of cells expressing pRb780 <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 4</ref>, C and E). The phosphorylation of Rb at serine 780 was also differentially regulated by other cell cycle inhibitors <ref type="figure">(Fig. S2 J)</ref>.</p><p>In its hypophosphorylated state, Rb plays a critical role in growth suppression. In coordination with Rb, the retinoblastoma-associated protein 46/48 (RbAP46/48; a histone chaperone protein) regulates the cell cycle by aiding in the transcriptional repression of Rb-related target genes, particularly genes involved in the G1 to S phase transition <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Harbour and Dean, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr">Taylor-Harding et al., 2004)</ref>. We assessed the fraction of cells expressing the cofactor RbAP46/48 in control and PP1-treated hPSCs. Flow cytometry analysis showed that the percentage of hPSCs expressing RbAP46/48 nearly doubles between control and PP1-treated cells <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 4</ref>, F and G). Furthermore, treatment with 25 µM PP1 for 24 h also regulated the expression of many genes associated with cell cycle control. The expression of genes promoting cell division, including Cyclin A1, Cdk2, and Cdc6, were significantly reduced in PP1-treated hPSCs relative to control cells ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 4 H)</ref>. Expression of p27, a cell cycle inhibitor that promotes growth arrest in G1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Toyoshima and Hunter, 1994)</ref>, was significantly increased in PP1-treated hPSCs compared with control cells <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 4 H)</ref>. No significant difference in expression levels was observed for Cyclin A2, Cyclin D1, Cyclin E1, E2f1, and p21 between control and PP1-treated hPSCs <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 4 H)</ref>. Together, these results show that PP1 treatment of hPSCs promotes growth inhibition and an accumulation of cells in the G1 phase by regulating genes involved in the G1 to S phase transition. The enhanced hypophosphorylated state of Rb increases the proportion of cells in the early G1 phase and more generally indicates an increased presence of early G1 in the hPSC cycle after PP1 treatment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Genetic suppression of Src regulates Rb activity and improves the differentiation capacity of hPSCs across all germ layers</head><p>Given that PP1 is a potent Src inhibitor <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Hanke et al., 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bain et al., 2007)</ref>, we assessed whether treatment of hPSCs with PP1 reduced protein levels of Src. Western blot analysis using two different Src specific antibodies showed that PP1 treatment does indeed suppress Src levels <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. 5 A)</ref>. To investigate whether suppression of Src mimics the effects of PP1 on hPSCs, we next genetically suppressed Src in hPSCs using siRNA. siR-NA-mediated knockdown of Src suppressed both the gene expression ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 5 B)</ref> and protein ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 5 C)</ref> levels of Src in hPSCs. Similar to PP1, Src knockdown also enhanced the activity of Rb by substantially reducing the levels of the phosphorylated and hyperphosphorylated forms of the Rb protein (ppRb) and increasing levels of the hypo-or underphosphorylated forms of Rb <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. 5 C)</ref>. Together with PP1, these results provide further support that inhibition of Src increases the proportion of hPSCs in the early G1 phase of the cell cycle.</p><p>Prior literature has shown that cells have an enhanced capacity to respond to extracellular signals in the G1 phase <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Scott et al., 1982)</ref>. To investigate whether these effects regulate the differentiation propensity of hPSCs, we next assessed whether genetic suppression of Src improves the differentiation potential of hPSCs across all germ layers. After Src knockdown of hPSCs with siRNA, we subsequently induced differentiation into each of the germ layers using three different directed differentiation protocols <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Chetty et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Fig. 5 D)</ref>. The percentage of cells becoming Sox1+, Brachy+, and Sox17+ cells was quantified to assess multilineage differentiation potential into the ectodermal, mesodermal, and endodermal germ layers, respectively <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. 5 D)</ref>. Transfection of hPSCs with Src siRNA before directed differentiation significantly increased the number and percentage of differentiated cells across all three germ layers <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. 5</ref>, E and F). After Src knockdown, the percentage of hPSCs that differentiated into each germ layer was enhanced by ∼2-10-fold ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 5 F)</ref>. At the time points assessed, differentiation rates of ∼50% were observed across all the germ layers after Src knockdown <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. 5 F)</ref>. While Src knockdown promoted aggregation of cells initially, the cells spread out more rapidly after differentiation compared with the PP1 treatment. The suppression of the protein expression of Src was also reduced to a greater degree in PP1-treated cultures compared with genetic suppression of Src, potentially due to variations in potency and/ or technical limitations of using siRNA <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. 5</ref>, A and C).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PP1 treatment improves the differentiation capacity of hPSCs across all germ layers</head><p>Similar to Src knockdown, we next tested whether the PP1 treatment improves the differentiation potential of hPSCs across germ layers. We treated HUES6 hPSCs with 25 µM PP1 for 24 h and subsequently induced differentiation into each of the germ layers ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. S4 A)</ref>. The percentage of cells becoming Pax6+, Brachy+, and Sox17+ cells was quantified to assess multilineage differentiation potential into the ectodermal, mesodermal, and endodermal germ layers, respectively <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. S4 A)</ref>. Treatment of hPSCs with 25 µM PP1 for 24 h before directed differentiation significantly increased the number and percentage of differentiated cells across all three germ layers <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig.  S4, B and C)</ref>. No significant differences in total cell number were observed for differentiations toward the ectodermal and endodermal germ layers. A 1-d differentiation toward the mesodermal germ layer resulted in a reduction in total cell number after the PP1 treatment. After PP1 treatment, the percentage of hPSCs that differentiated into each germ layer was enhanced by ∼10-fold for ectodermal differentiation, 60-fold for mesodermal differentiation, and 2.5-fold for endodermal differentiation <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. S4 C)</ref>. At the time points assessed, differentiation rates of 40-75% were observed across all the germ layers after the PP1 treatment, roughly comparable to the differentiation rates observed for genetic suppression of Src <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. 5)</ref>. Differences in these rates between the PP1 treatment and genetic suppression of Src could be due to variations in the potency of the treatments.</p><p>To further evaluate how well stem cells differentiate into the three germ layers after the PP1 treatment, we used the highly quantitative PCR (qPCR)-based Scorecard assay as an assessment of lineage specification <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bock et al., 2011)</ref>. Three published directed differentiation protocols were used to differentiate hPSCs into representative populations of the ectodermal (dEC), mesodermal (dME), and endodermal (dEN) germ layers <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Gifford et al., 2013</ref>; <ref type="figure">Fig. 6 A)</ref>. The expression levels of a panel of genes specific to pluripotent stem cells and the three germ layers were measured in control and PP1-treated hPSCs and differentiated cultures. For most germ layer markers, higher expression levels were observed in PP1-treated differentiated cells compared with controls ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 6 B)</ref>. The mean expression across all ectodermal, mesodermal, and endodermal markers on the panel was also significantly higher in PP1-treated differentiated cells relative to controls <ref type="figure">(Fig. 6 B, right bars)</ref>. These differences were generally not present in PP1-treated and control hPSCs before directed differentiation <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. S4 D)</ref>. In comparison to a reference set of 14 other pluripotent stem cell lines, the PP1treated differentiated cells had a higher germ layer differentiation potential than control samples <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. S4</ref>, E and F) and often had higher potential than other cell lines in the reference set.</p><p>These results show that the PP1 treatment improves lineage specification after directed differentiation by enhancing the expression of genes relevant for a given lineage. Together, these analyses show that the PP1 treatment improves the capacity for differentiation using six different induction protocols.</p><p>Improvements in lineage specification would predict that the PP1 effects should persist to improve differentiation at subsequent stages of differentiation. To evaluate the long-term effects of PP1, hPSCs were differentiated through a 15-d directed differentiation protocol into Pdx1+ pancreatic progenitor cells after the initial 24-h 25 µM PP1 treatment <ref type="figure">(Fig. 6 C)</ref>. The PP1 treatment of hPSCs increased the number of Pdx1+ cells by threefold, inducing a 70% differentiation rate <ref type="figure">(Fig. 6, D and E)</ref>. The PP1-treated cells also continued to expand throughout the stages of the directed differentiation protocol <ref type="figure">(Fig. 6 F)</ref>. Further differentiation of the PP1-treated hPSCs toward terminally differentiated cells of the pancreatic lineage <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. S5 A)</ref> promoted differentiation into Nkx6.1+ and Ngn3+ endocrine cells as well as hormone-expressing C-peptide+ cells <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. S5 B)</ref>. Thus, the increased differentiation efficiency after PP1 treatment is sustained throughout subsequent stages of differentiation and shows that the PP1 treatment is capable of driving hPSCs past the initial germ layers toward later stages of development.</p><p>In prior work, we showed that pretreatment with DMSO at a concentration of 1-2% could significantly improve the differentiation propensities of hPSCs <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Chetty et al., 2013)</ref>. We tested whether combining PP1 and DMSO could have beneficial effects on hPSC differentiation. While combining the two treatments (25 µM PP1 with 2% DMSO) simultaneously compromised cell survival (unpublished data), sequential treatment with a lower concentration of DMSO (0.5%) had positive effects. After a 24-h treatment with 25 µM PP1, hPSCs were treated with 0.5% DMSO for 24 h and then cultured in differentiation media with Wnt3a and Activin A for 24 h <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. S5 C)</ref>. This com- bined treatment increased the percentage and absolute number of Brachy+ cells relative to cultures treated with PP1 alone in the HUES 6 line ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 1 and Fig. S5, D-F)</ref>. The combined treat-ment increased the absolute yield of differentiated cells in other cell lines as well <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. S5 G)</ref>. These findings indicate that optimizing the concentrations and timing of the DMSO and PP1 <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>. PP1 treatment improves the specificity of differentiation of hPSCs.

Using different doses of these two treatments at various stages of directed differentiation could also improve long-term differentiation potential and should be further explored.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>In summary, the results show that a potent Src inhibitor, PP1, regulates the cell cycle and differentiation capacity of both human embryonic and iPSCs. A 24-h treatment with PP1 modulates the expression of genes involved in the G1 to S phase transition, enhances Rb activity, and increases the percent of cells in the early G1 phase of the cell cycle. After these effects, hPSCs respond more efficiently and effectively to various directed differentiation protocols, leading to improvements in differentiation potentials across all germ layers. Genetic suppression of Src in hPSCs similarly activates Rb and improves differentiation capacity, suggesting an important role for Src in controlling proliferation and differentiation. These early manipulations of the starting state of hPSCs increase the output and specificity of differentiated cells at subsequent stages. The PP1 treatment enhances the yield of differentiated cells to 80% even in cell lines that would otherwise have low differentiation propensities. In cases where efficiencies are already high under control conditions, PP1 has no adverse effects. Thus, the effects are durable in that they extend beyond the initial germ layer specification.</p><p>Our findings on the importance of the cell cycle mirror results in the literature on embryogenesis. In early development as well as in pluripotent stem cells, a truncated cell cycle initially supports the amplification of cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Smith, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Orford and Scadden, 2008)</ref>. However, the cell cycle then lengthens as development progresses to incorporate gap phases and give cells the opportunity to become more specialized <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Trelstad et al., 1967;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Hartwell and Weinert, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Murray and Kirschner, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Frederick and Andrews, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Edgar and Lehner, 1996)</ref>. Similarly, lengthening the truncated cell cycle of pluripotent stem cells through suppression of Src or small molecules such as PP1 may help direct their differentiation into specialized cell types.</p><p>Few factors have been identified to date that effectively regulate the pluripotent cell cycle and directed differentiation <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Smith, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Orford and Scadden, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Zhu et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Chetty et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Li and Kirschner, 2014)</ref>. PP1 has proven to be a potent tool to regulate the pluripotent G1 phase, as it enhances the hypophosphorylated state of Rb and enriches cells in the early G1 phase before directed differentiation. Our findings also support recent work suggesting that the G1 phase of the cell cycle may play an important role in enhancing the differentiation of hPSCs <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Sela et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Pauklin and Vallier, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Singh et al., 2013)</ref>. Given its role in regulating Rb and the cell cycle, PP1 could also be a useful tool in controlling the tumorigenicity of pluripotent stem cells and their differentiated progeny to enhance their therapeutic utility (Ben-David and Benvenisty, 2011).</p><p>The robust impacts of the PP1 treatment and genetic suppression of Src on hPSCs are consistent with prior work showing the importance of Src tyrosine kinase activity in regulating cell proliferation in early development <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Trelstad et al., 1967;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Frederick and Andrews, 1994)</ref>. In addition, with the evolution of multicellular organisms, a negative regulation of Src was acquired that proved to be critical for interactions and communications between cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Segawa et al., 2006)</ref>. Src inhibition may similarly play an important regulatory role as a single cell undergoes cell division into a multicellular organism in early development.</p><p>More broadly, this study shows that the PP1 treatment alters the "starting state" of hPSCs to be more amenable to directed differentiation. Manipulating this starting state, whether through PP1, direct inhibition of Src, or other tools, increases the utility of pluripotent stem cells. Studying how this state relates to the recently established primitive "reset" state of hPSCs <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Takashima et al., 2014)</ref> could provide further mechanistic insights into how various pluripotent states control cell fate decisions and the developmental potential of pluripotent stem cells.</p></div>
