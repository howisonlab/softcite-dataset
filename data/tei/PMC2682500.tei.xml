			<abstract>
				<p>Few molecular studies have been devoted to the finger drop process that occurs during banana fruit ripening. Recent studies revealed the involvement of changes in the properties of cell wall polysaccharides in the pedicel rupture area. In this study, the expression of cell-wall modifying genes was monitored in peel tissue during post-harvest ripening of Cavendish banana fruit, at median area (control zone) and compared with that in the pedicel rupture area (drop zone). To this end, three pectin methylesterase (PME) and seven xyloglucan endotransglycosylase/hydrolase (XTH) genes were isolated. The accumulation of their mRNAs and those of polygalaturonase, expansin, and pectate lyase genes already isolated from banana were examined. During post-harvest ripening, transcripts of all genes were detected in both zones, but accumulated differentially. MaPME1, MaPG1, and MaXTH4 mRNA levels did not change in either zone. Levels of MaPME3 and MaPG3 mRNAs increased greatly only in the control zone and at the late ripening stages. For other genes, the main molecular changes occurred 1-4 d after ripening induction.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Banana is the second ranking fruit crop in the world, with an annual world production of ;70 million metric tons <ref type="bibr">(FAOstat, 2007</ref> faostat.fao.org/site/567/DesktopDefault. aspx?). Banana fruit ripening is characterized by a burst of ethylene production and respiration concomitantly with physicochemical and biochemical changes, including chlorophyll breakdown, increased starch degradation and sugar synthesis, and fruit softening. Finger drop is one of the main features closely associated with the banana ripening process. This process, which was reported for the first time in the triploid Cavendish AAA group, involves physiological softening and weakening, thus causing individual fruit in a hand to separate from the crown <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Hicks, 1934;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Baldry et al., 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Semple and Thompson 1988)</ref>. Bananas are marketed in hands of generally 4-9 fruits. Dislodgement of individual fruits from the hand considerably reduces the commercial value of the product because hands with fingers missing or fingers without pedicels cannot be sold to consumers. The finger drop process thus reduces the economic value of bananas. Despite this important economic impact, few studies have been devoted to gaining an insight into the physiological mechanisms related to banana finger drop. Susceptibility to finger drop varies widely according to cultivars and their ripening conditions, with triploid cultivars being less susceptible than tetraploids <ref type="bibr">(New and Marriot, 1983)</ref>. Among triploid cultivars, Valery is less susceptible than Gros Michel, and Hom Tong (Musa acuminata, AAA) shows massive drop while Namwa (Musa sp., ABB) does not <ref type="bibr">(New and Marriot, 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Saengpook et al., 2007)</ref>. In addition to cultivars, the level of fruit development ripening conditions (including ethylene, humidity, and temperature) also affect the susceptibility to banana finger drop <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Semple and Thompson, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Paull, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Imsabai et al., 2006)</ref>. Studies on the physiological mechanisms of banana finger drop have only recently been carried out and, to our knowledge, performed only at the biochemical level. In a study on two varieties that display massive (Hom Tong variety) and no finger drop (Namwa variety), respectively, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Imsabai et al. (2006)</ref> showed that peel water content and thickness did not affect the finger drop process. By contrast, differential changes in the water-and CDTA-soluble fractions, and in the insoluble pectin fraction at the peel rupture area in the Hom Tong variety indicated high pectin breakdown and degradation activity in this variety. The authors also showed that this pectin breakdown was mainly the result of pectate lyase and polygalacturonase enzymes, as their corresponding activities increased concomitantly in the peel rupture area of the Hom Tong variety as compared with those of the Namwa variety. It is now assumed that cell wall modifications that occur during fruit ripening correspond to a complex process involving different mechanisms, including enzymatic and non-enzymatic degradation of cell wall components <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Dumville and Fry, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bennett and Labavitch, 2008)</ref>, cell wall synthesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Mitcham et al., 1989</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Mitcham et al., , 1991</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Greve and Labavitch, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Huysamer et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Rose and Bennett, 1999)</ref> and/or loosening of the cell wall network mediated by non-enzymatic proteins like expansin <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Brummell, 2006)</ref>. Enzymatic degradation of cell wall components is the result of the induction, at both molecular and biochemical levels, of pectolic and/or non-pectolitic cell wall-modifying proteins (CWMPs) according to the specific class of polysaccharides used as substrate. The pectolytic enzymes include endo-and exo-polygalacturonases (endo-EC 3.2.1.15; exo-EC 3.2.1.67), pectate lyases (PEL; EC 4.2. 2.2), pectin methylesterases (PME; EC 3.1.1.11), pectin acetylesterases (PAE; EC 3.1.1.-), b-galactosidases (EC 3.2. 1.23), and a-L-arabinofuranosidases (EC 3.2.1.55) <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Vicente et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Goulao and Oliveira, 2008)</ref>. These enzymes are able to cleave or modify the nature of the polysaccharide backbone or to remove neutral sugars from branched side-chains. Non-pectolytic enzymes are responsible for hemicellulose modifications and include endo-1,4-bglucanases (EGase; EC 3.2.1.4), endo-1,4-b-xylanases (EC 3.2.1.8), b-xylanases (EC 3.2.1.37), and xyloglucan endotransglycosylase/hydrolases (XTH; EC 2.4.1.207). Many of these proteins have been investigated, at both molecular and biochemical levels, in relationship with banana fruit softening. A co-ordinated increase in mRNA abundance, de novo synthesis or activity of a number of putative cell wallmodifying enzymes that may be responsible for or contribute significantly to polymer modifications has been observed <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Dominguez-Puigjaner et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Pua et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Marin-Rodriguez et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Trivedi and Nath, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Asif and Nath, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Zhuang et al., 2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Zhuang et al., , 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Sane et al., 2007)</ref>.</p><p>As none of these genes have been examined in relation to finger drop, an attempt was made to investigate, at the molecular level, the putative relationship between the expression of some cell wall-modifying genes (CWMGs) and the finger drop process in order to identify: (i) the putative physiological mechanism of the cell wall metabolism involved in the finger drop process, and (ii) relevant genes involved for purposes of identification of functional molecular markers.</p><p>Banana is a complex species and attempts to improve the fruit quality through breeding strategies is complex and difficult to set up. Access to functional molecular markers derived from relevant genes associated with fruit quality traits should therefore provide a valuable and helpful resource for the development of new crossing strategies and the selection process. Moreover, gaining further insight into the molecular mechanisms that govern the elaboration of fruit quality traits and their regulation is a key prerequisite for the development of other strategies to improve banana quality traits like post-harvest technology and/or biotechnology approaches.</p><p>In the present study, the accumulation of mRNA genes encoding a broad array of enzymes known to hydrolyse or modify the fine structure of cell wall polysaccharides was examined, with the view of correlating particular mechanisms and genes with previously observed changes in cell wall composition during finger drop.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Plant material</head><p>All tissues used in this study were harvested from three banana plants (Musa acuminata, AAA, Cavendish, cv. Grande Naine) grown at the CIRAD research station (elevation: 250 m; andosol; rainfall: 3500 mm year À1 ), Guadeloupe (French West Indies). During growth, bunches on banana plants were covered with blue plastic bags to hamper insect infestations, and to streamline the development of whole fruits on the bunch. Green fruits were harvested at commercial ripeness, as determined on the basis of the heat unit concept <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Ganry and Meyer, 1975;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Jullien et al., 2008)</ref>. At each harvesting time, only internal fingers of the median hand on the bunch, considered as comparable <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Liu, 1976)</ref>, were taken into account for each bunch. After harvest, all fruits were kept for 24 h at 20°C in chambers ventilated with humidified air before treatment with 10 000 ppm of azethyl (95% nitrogen/5% ethylene) for 24 h at 20°C and ambient humidity. From 1-7 d after treatment (DAT), a sample of three fruits was taken daily for finger drop measurement. Immediately at the end of each measurement, peel tissues corresponding to the median part of the fruit (control zone) and to the rupture area of the fruit pedicel (drop zone) ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 1)</ref> were sampled, separately frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80°C until use.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measurement of finger drop variations during post-harvest ripening of fruit</head><p>Finger drop was estimated by measuring the pedicel rupture force using a TA-XT2 penetrometer and an adapted probe as follows. Banana fruit were attached 6 cm above a table with a large clip. The probe was pressed down to a depth of 40 mm and at a constant speed of 5 mm s À1 , at the pedicel until it separated from the fruit <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Chillet et al., 2008)</ref>. The required force was expressed in Newtons (N). All of these measurements were performed in triplicate on three separate fruits and the experiment was repeat three times.</p><p>Isolation of banana fruit genes coding for xyloglucan endotransglycosylase/hydrolase-like (XTH-like) and pectin methylesterase-like (PME-like)</p><p>Partial cDNAs encoding banana XTH-like genes were amplified using the 3# RACE-PCR method <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Frohman, 1990)</ref>. Total RNA was extracted separately from peel tissue from control and drop zones of banana fruit taken at commercial ripeness, and at 1-4 DAT, using the modified hot-borate method <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Wan and Wilkins, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr">Mbéguié-A-Mbéguié et al., 2008a)</ref>. According to the manufacturer's instructions, 2 lg of each RNA extract was DNAse-treated using RQI DNase (Promega, Charbonières, France) before being separately reverse-transcribed into cDNA using Oligo-dT 17 primers <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Frohman, 1990</ref>; see <ref type="table">Supplementary Table S1</ref> at JXB online) and AMV reverse transcriptase enzyme (Promega). These cDNA were pooled and 1 ll of this mixture was subjected to 3# RACE-PCR with Xth-F1 and dT 17 -adapter primers in a 25 ll reaction containing 13 Taq buffer (Eurobio, Courtaboeuf, France), 150 nM of dNTP, 1.5 mM of MgCl 2 , 200 nM of each primer, and 1 U of Taq polymerase. Xth-F1 is a degenerated forward primer designed from a conserved HDE(I/M)DFEF region among plant XTH-like proteins ( <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>). The PCR program involved one cycle of 1 min at 94°C for template denaturation and Taq activation followed by 40 cycles of 30 s at 94°C for template denaturation, 1 min at 40°C for primer annealing, and 2 min at 72°C for template elongation. The isolated cDNA fragments (approximately 1100 bp) were cloned into pGEM-T vector using the pGEM-T Easy Cloning kit (Promega) and sequenced by Cogenics (Grenoble, France). GenBank accession numbers are FJ264506 (MaXTH3), FJ264507 (MaXTH4), FJ264508 (MaXTH5), FJ264509 (MaXTH6), FJ264510 (MaXTH7), FJ264511 (MaXTH8), and FJ264512 (MaXTH9). <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>. Measurement of finger drop variations during post-harvest ripening of Cavendish banana through pedicel rupture force measurement. Banana fruits harvested at the mature green stage were stored overnight at 20°C before treatment with 10 000 ppm of azethyl (5% ethylene+95% nitrogen) for 24 h. Fruits were further kept at 20°C in air for 7 d to ripen. Banana finger drop was evaluated on the basis of the pedicel rupture force expressed in Newtons (N). This force was measured daily from the harvesting point (Ht) to day 7, as described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Chillet et al. (2008)</ref>. Each data point is the mean of values obtained from at least four fruits originating from four replicate bunches. Vertical bars indicate standard deviation (SD). When no bar is shown, the SD is smaller than the symbol.</p><p>For pectin methylesterase genes, one partial cDNA and two genomic sequences coding for banana PME-like genes were isolated in this study. The partial cDNA sequence was isolated throughout EST sequencing. PME genomic sequences were identified throughout sequencing and annotation of BAC clones MAC077E20 (accession number AC226050) and MAC088K20 (accession number AC226051), isolated from a Cavendish BAC library <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Piffanelli et al., 2003)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Bioinformatic sequence analysis</head><p>The sequence similarity of the genes isolated in this study was determined using the online BLAST <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Altschul et al., 1997)</ref> and BLAST 2 sequence <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Tatusova and Madden, 1999)</ref> programs on the National Center for Biotechnology Information BLAST website (National Library of Medicine, Bethesda, MD). For sequence comparison throughout the BLAST 2 program, two additional parameters were introduced, Qcov and Scov, which allows us to take into account the difference of the length between sequences. Query coverage (Qcov) is the ratio of length of the match by length of the query sequence. This value indicates the part of the query sequence covered by the alignment. Similarly, Subject coverage (Scov) was calculated as the ratio of length of the match by length of the subject or target length, and indicates the part of the subject or target sequence covered by the alignment.</p><p>All sequence alignments and phylogenetic tree construction were performed using the ClustalX algorithm with the Gonnet residue weights <ref type="bibr">(Thompson et al., 1997)</ref>. For XTHs genes, the pair-wise alignment parameters used included a gap opening penalty of 35 and a gap extension penalty of 0.75. For multiple alignments, the gap opening penalty was 15, with a gap extension penalty of 0.3 and the delay divergent sequences was set at 25%. The consensus tree was drawn using the TREE VIEW program <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Page, 1996)</ref>.

As for the MaPME2 and MaPME3 genes, the corresponding specific primers were designed based on the 3#-UTR predicted from the corresponding genomic sequence. The generated PCR fragment was further cloned and sequenced to confirm that it corresponded to a PME genomic sequence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Real-time qPCR analysis</head><p>All qPCR experiments were performed on an ABI 7000 sequence detection apparatus (Applied Biosystems, Courtaboeuf, France) using the SYBR Green PCR Master Mix as described by Mbéguié-A-Mbéguié et al. <ref type="bibr">(2008b)</ref>. Two micrograms of total RNA extracted from different banana fruit tissues and organs treated with RQ1 DNase (Promega, Charbonnières, France) to remove possible contaminating genomic DNA were used. First-strand cDNA was synthesized from these RNA using AMV reverse transcriptase enzymes (Promega, Charbonnières, France) and random hexamers according to the manufacturer's instructions. To hamper the effect of putative PCR inhibitors that might be present in the reverse transcriptase reaction, as well as pipetting errors, the cDNA was 10-fold diluted with distilled water, and 5 ll of the diluted cDNA was used as a template for qPCR analysis. The qPCR program included one cycle of 5 min at 94°C for template denaturation and Taq activation, followed by 40 cycles of 30 s at 94°C for template denaturation, 15 s at 50°C for primer annealing, and 30 s at 72°C for primer elongation. Fluorescence was analysed using Sequence Detection Software (Applied Biosystems Courtaboeuf, France). A cycle threshold value (Ct) was calculated from the amplification curves by selecting the optimal DRn (emission of reporter dye over starting background fluorescence) in the exponential portion of the amplification plot. The amplification efficiency of all primer sets was determined by qPCR analysis as described previously. To this end, we used 6 log of 2-fold serial dilutions made from a pool of cDNA reverse-transcribed from a mixture of RQI DNase-treated mRNA from different banana fruit tissues and organs. For each dilution, a qPCR was run in triplicate. The efficiency (slope) ranges were 83-100% (3.3-3.7), 87-100% (3.3-3.6), 73.3-77.3% (4.02-4.1), and 72-92% (3.12-4.2) for expansin, pectin methylesterase, polygalacturonase, pectate lyase, and xyloglucan endotransferase/hydrolase genes, respectively.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Finger drop evolution of banana fruit measured via the pedicel rupture force Banana fruits were harvested at commercial harvest grade corresponding to approximately 90 days after flowering (DAF). According to the rupture force measurement ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 1)</ref>, Cavendish banana finger drop started 1 d after ripening induction and continued progressively throughout the postharvest ripening stage. However, a marked decreased was observed between days 1 to 3 after ripening induction, with more than a 2-fold decrease in the pedicel rupture force. As the pedicel rupture force pattern is considered to be a way of measuring banana finger drop <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Saengpook et al., 2007)</ref>, our data suggest that our experimental conditions led to the development of the finger drop process of Cavendish banana.</p></div>

Compared with MaXET1 and MaXET2 genes, a high homology was observed with MaXTH7 and MaXTH4, respectively. Analysis of the predicted MaXTH polypeptides revealed that they contained a DEIDFEFLG motif conserved within glycosyl hydrolase family 16 (GH16) enzymes and, adjacent to the putative active site, the potential N-linked glycosylation site N-X-S/T motif.

Musa EST sequences produced one partial cDNA sequence (MaPME1 accession number FJ264505). A similarity search in available Musa BAC sequences produced two BAC sequences: MaC077E20 (GenBank accession number AC226050) and MaC088K20 (GenBank accession number AC226051) of 177 729 bp and 152 711 bp, respectively. Automatic and manual annotation of these BACs showed that they contained 26 and 19 predicted genes in addition to 1 and 3 repetitive elements, respectively. The two BACs sequences are schematically shown in <ref type="figure">Supplementary Fig. S2</ref> at JXB online. They are collinear and share an overlapping region of 130 kbp. Both sequences contained one common identical putative PME gene (MaPME2). MaC077E20 contained an additional putative PME gene (MaPME3).

The features of MaPME cDNAs and genomic sequences are described in <ref type="table">Table 1A</ref>. The putative promoter regions of both MaPME2 and MaPME3 genes were analysed. They contained numerous cis-regulatory sequences that might be involved in tissue-specific or developmentallyregulated gene expression (see <ref type="table">Supplementary Table S2</ref> at JXB online).

MaPME2 and MaPME3 genes shared 7% identity at the nucleotide level, while at the amino acid level, they showed 38% and 56% identity and similarity, respectively. Compared to MaPME1 cDNA, MaPME2 and MaPME3 genomic sequences diverged at the nucleotide level. Indeed, the high percentage of identity (75%) observed between these sequences is not significant as it was obtained in a short portion of their nucleotide sequence, as shown by the low Scov and Qcov values (less than 10% with MaPME2 and 25% with MaPME3). At the polypeptide level, MaPME2 and MaPME3 shared 46% and 60% identity and similarity, respectively, with polypeptides predicted from MaPME1 cDNA. The predicted polypeptides of the three MaPME genes presented features that are conserved in all PME polypeptides. Among these, there are the pre-and pro-sequences at the N-terminal extension, and five polypeptide segments that are characteristic of the C-terminal catalytic region, which constitutes the mature PME enzyme: GxYxE, QAVAL, QDTL, DFIFG, LGRPW <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Micheli, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Markovic and Janecek, 2004</ref>; see Supplementary <ref type="figure">Fig. S2 at JXB online)</ref>.

A slight increase was only observed in overripe fruit taken 7 d after ripening induction. In the drop zone and from day 1 after ripening induction to day 6, the MaPME2 mRNA level was approximately 2-fold increased on average, compared with the control zone, with a maximum 3-fold increase observed 2 d after ripening induction and a minimum observed in overripe fruit taken 7 d after ripening induction.

Despite this, a set of qPCR primers was designed, as specific as possible, for each MaPG gene. For MaPG1 that spans the entire MaPG2 cDNA, primers were designed within the additional 160 bp in the 3#-UTR. For MaPG2, there was a failure to identify a divergent region with MaPG1 to design a specific MaPG2 primer. Nevertheless, MaPG1 and MaPG2 displayed quite different accumulation patterns, suggesting that putative cross amplification of the MaPG1 gene with the MaPG2 primer set would not have interfered during the gene expression analysis. No marked changes were observed on MaPG1 gene expression during fruit ripening in both the control and drop zones <ref type="figure">(Fig. 3C</ref>). In the control zone, the time-course of MaPG2 mRNA accumulation increased during ripening from day 1 to day 4 after ripening induction and decreased thereafter. A similar pattern was observed for MaPG2 in the drop zone, except for a marked but transient decrease (2-fold) observed at day 2 after ripening induction. The mRNA level of the MaPG3 gene decreased during ripening in the same manner in both the control and drop zones until day 6 after ripening induction. In overripe fruit taken at day 7, this level was approximately 10-fold higher in the control zone than in the drop zone. However, this level remained comparable to that of green fruit sampled at harvest. Finally, concerning MaPG4, the corresponding transcript was drastically induced in the control zone during the late ripening stages, namely 5, 6, and 7 d after ripening induction. In the drop zone, two peaks of MaPG4 mRNA accumulation were observed. The first one occurred 1 d after ripening induction, with approximately 400-fold more expression in the drop zone than in the control zone, and the second one, during the late ripening stage, began at day 5 after ripening induction and reached its maximum at day 7, but at a 2-fold lower level than in the control zone.</p></div>

MaXTH9 was the most highly and transiently expressed as compared to the four others, while MaXTH8 expression decreased slowly during the late ripening stage. By contrast, two XTH genes (MaXTH3 and MaXTH5) were more highly and differentially expressed in the control zone than in the drop zone. MaXTH3 was transiently induced in the control zone with a maximum observed 3 d after ripening induction, while in the drop zone no marked change was observed during postharvest ripening. MaXTH5 was less expressed in the drop zone compared to the control zone. In this area, MaXTH5 presented two peaks of expression at days 3 and 7 after ripening, respectively.

Firstly, there were changes in the expression of pectolytic and cell wall loosening genes, mainly during days 1-2, followed by those of xyloglucan genes, mainly during days 3-4. Moreover, within each mechanism, there was also sequential induction of the different genes involved.</p><p>The results of a comparative analysis of CWMG expression in drop and control zones allows the selection of candidate genes involved in the finger drop process.

Both MaPEL1 and MaPEL2, whose mRNA levels increased by 2-fold and 1.6-fold in the drop zone, possibly induced this increased PEL activity in the drop zone. Therefore, both MaPEL1 and MaPEL2 genes could be considered as candidates. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Imsabai et al.

Despite this, MaPME2 and MaPG4 could also be considered as putative candidates of finger drop based on the marked change in their mRNA accumulation in the drop zone relative to the control zone. The discrepancy between PG and PME gene expression and activities could be explained by post-transcriptional regulation of the activation of enzyme activity or subcellular localization (targeting cell walls). It is also possible that the PG and PME activities reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Imsabai et al.

However, some genes seem to be specific to softening (MaXTH5, MaXTH3, and MaEXP2), finger drop (MaPME2, MaEXP1, MaEXP4, and MaEXP5, MaXTH6, MaXTH8, and MaXTH9), or both (MaPG4, MaPEL1, and MaPEL2; MaXET1, MaXET2, and MaXTH7). Moreover, the two processes seem to be quite distinct in this variety, as shown by the type of genes involved and their sequential induction, with finger drop being the main induced process followed by softening. Regarding ethylene, our data showed that Cavendish banana fruit developed finger drop mainly during the early stage of fruit ripening (days 1-4), a period corresponding to a burst of ethylene production. Concomitantly, a high level of transcription of some ripening-and ethylene-dependent genes like MaEXP1 and MaPELs <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Pua et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Trivedi and Nath, 2004)</ref> was also observed. It would be interesting to examine the relationship between ethylene production during ripening and the finger drop process. Does the specific induction of the banana finger drop process involve, at molecular level, ethylene production and/or require the ethylene transduction pathway or not?</p><p>In conclusion, the data reported here represent a substantial contribution towards understanding the postharvest banana finger drop phenomenon at the molecular level. More specifically, the identification of several cell wall-modifying genes with expression profiles related to finger drop provided us with good candidates for functional studies in banana species. These candidate genes could be useful in molecular breeding schemes for banana improvement using cultivars differing in their proneness to develop finger drop and which are currently being assessed.</p></div>
