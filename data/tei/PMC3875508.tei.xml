				<p>Objectives: The purpose of this study was to determine the influence of platform switching on stress distribution of two different implant systems using three-dimensional (3D) finite element models. Materials and Methods: Six 3D finite element models were created to replicate two different implant systems with peri-implant bone tissue, in which six different implantabutment configurations were represented: model XiVE-a: 3.8-mm-diameter implant and 3.8-mm-diameter abutment; model XiVE-b (platform-switching model): 4.5-mm-diameter implant and 3.8-mm-diameter abutment; model XiVE-c: 4.5-mm-diameter implant and 4.5-mm-diameter abutment; model 3i-a: 4.0-mm-diameter implant and 4.1-mm-diameter abutment; model 3i-b (platform-switching model): 5.0-mm-diameter implant and 4.1-mmdiameter abutment; model 3i-c: 5.0-mm-diameter implant and 5.0-mm-diameter abutment. vertical and oblique loads of 100 were applied to all models. Results: While the pattern of stress distribution was similar for both loading situations, oblique loading resulted in higher intensity and greater distribution of stress than axial loading in both cortical bone and implant-abutment-interface. Stress distribution at periimplant bone was almost identical with similar magnitudes for all six models. In both implant systems, platform-switching models demonstrated lower maximum von Mises stress in cortical bone than conventional models. However, in both implant systems and under both loading situations, platform-switching models showed higher stresses at the implantabutment interface than conventional models. Conclusion: In both implant systems, platform switching design reduced the stress concentration in the crestal bone and shifted it towards the area of implant-abutment interface.</p>

Although this 1.5-2.0 mm of bone resorption is still clinically acceptable <ref type="bibr">[18]</ref>, the ability to reduce this crestal bone loss may have several advantages such as improved esthetics, higher bone to implant contact and better primary stability. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr">19]</ref>. In order to minimize this crestal bone resorption, several techniques and procedures such as non-submerged technique <ref type="bibr">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr">21]</ref>, utilizing micro-roughness on implant neck surface <ref type="bibr">[22]</ref> and platform switching <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[23]</ref> have recently been developed. The concept of platform switching was introduced by Lazzara and Porter, and refers to the use of a smaller-diameter abutment on a larger-diameter implant collar <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[23]</ref>. Through placement of the smaller prosthetic components on the implant platform, IAJ is moved inward from the implant shoulder and further away from the crestal bone <ref type="bibr">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">24]</ref>. Hypothetically, platform switching may increase the distance between the inflammatory cell infiltrate and the adjacent alveolar crest that can limit crestal bone resorption around the restored two-piece implants <ref type="bibr">[25]</ref>. The results of several histomorphometric studies showed that platform switching can significantly help to maintain the peri-implant soft and hard tissue and may be especially beneficial in esthetically demanding locations that require strong soft tissue support <ref type="bibr">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[29]</ref>. In the past two decades, finite element analysis (FEA) has become an increasingly useful tool for prediction of the effects of stress on the implant and its surrounding bone, and has been used extensively in describing biomechanical performance of dental implant systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[30]</ref>. However, excessive simplifications of geometry will result in considerable inaccu-racy in FEA results. To produce more accurate geometries, some methods starting from computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance data of actual human bones have been proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref>. Several studies on platform switching, using three-dimensional (3D) finite element models, reported the biomechanical advantage of shifting stress concentration area away from the cervical bone implant interface <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr">[34]</ref>. Some FEA studies, on the other hand, showed that platform switching may have a minimal effect on von-Mises stress in the crestal region of the cortical bone <ref type="bibr">[35]</ref>. Interestingly, a new FEA investigation about platform switching demonstrated that the reduction in bone strain was mostly caused by increasing the diameter of the implant, instead of using the platform switching technique <ref type="bibr">[36]</ref>.</p><p>Reviewing the dental literature revealed that there are still some controversies about the biomechanical advantages of platform switching. Therefore, the objectives of this three-dimensional FEA study were to compare and analyze the biomechanical effects of platform switching on the crestal bone around the two different dental implant systems.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FE model design</head><p>Computerized tomographic (CT) images of a human edentulous mandibular first molar area were acquired. The distance between adjacent CT images was 2.0 mm. The mandible was approximately 8.5 mm in width buccolingually and 24 mm in height inferosuperiorly. The cross-sectional image was extruded to create a 3D section of the mandible and then 3D finite element models were constructed. Models were prepared with two implant systems: XiVE S Plus (DENTSPLY Friadent, GmbH, Germany) and 3i Certain (Biomet 3i, Florida, USA). These implant systems were assembled on the mandible creating six different models: model  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig 1)</ref>. The optical digitizing system ATOS II (GOM, Braunschweig, Germany) was used to digitize the implants and abutments with high accuracy.</p><p>The measured data were imported to Solid-Works 2008 environment (Solidworks Crop., Concord, MA, USA) to construct the solid models that were analyzed by a three dimensional FE analysis package (ABAQUS V6.7-1; Simulia Corp., Providence, USA).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stress distribution in the implants and periimplant bone tissue:</head><p>The results from FEA are demonstrated in stress maps with a color scale that makes it possible to compare the stress distribution in different structures (implants and peri-implant bone tissues) of all six models <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig 2)</ref>. In order to compare stress distribution among the structures in different models more quantitatively, stress values are presented for equivalent stresses (von Mises) ( <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2)</ref>.  The positive values show tensile stress and the negatives demonstrate compressive stress.The pattern of stress distribution was almost similar under both loading situations and for both two implant systems. However, oblique loads produced more stress among the models than axial loads. In all models and under both loading situations, stress values were higher for the cortical bone than the cancellous bone (  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2)</ref>.</p><p>In both 3i and XiVE implant systems, wide platform implants (models 3i-c and XiVE-c) presented lower stress values and more favorable patterns of stress distribution compared to regular platform implants (models 3i-a and XiVE-a).</p><p>For maximum principal stress, the tensile stress concentration was located on the buccal side of the cortical bone tissue that was on the opposite side of load application. For minimum principal stress, the location of compressive stress concentration was under the applied-load side of the models. In almost all models, tensile stress was less than compressive stress. In both implant systems and for both loading conditions, the platform switching models presented obvious decreases in tension and compression values in the third principal stress. However, for the first principal stress, wide platform models showed lower tension values, while platform-switching models showed lower compression values (Figs 4 and 5).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stress distribution at the implant-abutment interface</head><p>Analyzing implant-abutment interface demonstrated that the stress concentration was around the periphery of the uppermost surface of the implant in the conventional models (models a, c) <ref type="figure">(Fig 3)</ref>, while this high stress area shifted toward the center of the implant in the platform-switching models. In both implant systems and for both loading conditions, the platform switching increased the stress value in the implant-abutment interface.  Moreover, wide platform implants (models 3ic and XiVE-c) showed lower von Mises stresses than implants with regular platforms (models 3i-a and XiVE-a) ( <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>Bone resorption close to the first thread of the two-piece implants is frequently observed during initial loading <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">5]</ref>. To achieve and maintain stable osseointegration for implants in function, high stress concentration in the bone should be avoided. Some studies showed that using abutments with a smaller diameter than the implant neck or platform-switching technique helps in reducing crestal bone resorption <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr">[25]</ref>. The possible reasons for bone preservation with the platform switching technique include inward shifting of the location of the IAJ or the stress concentration area between the abutment and implant <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">26]</ref>.</p><p>The result of the present study revealed that the platform switching reduced von Mises stress values at the crestal bone in both implant systems. It has been reported in the literature that crestal bone resorption is related to excessive load and damage of the supporting interfacial bone <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[41]</ref>. Stress concentration can lead to bone loss due to bone micro-damage and creation of crater-like bone defects around the implant <ref type="bibr">[32,</ref><ref type="bibr">42]</ref>. Tabata et al.</p><p>[32] reported that von Mises, maximum and minimum principal stress were reduced in periimplant bone tissue and implant when the platform-switching concept was used. In studies conducted by Hsu et al. <ref type="bibr">[36]</ref> and Schrotenboer et al.</p><p>[33], their FE analyses showed that when the abutment diameter was reduced, less stress was transferred to the crestal bone. However, the results of the present study are in contrast to the results previously reported by Pessoa et al.</p><p>[35] The possible reasons may be attributed to the fact that in their FE models, platform switching was defined as the circumferential horizontal mismatch of 0.5 mm between implant and abutment, while in the present study, this horizontal mismatch was 1 mm for 3i implants and 0.7 mm for XiVE implants. In another study, Canay and Akca <ref type="bibr">[43]</ref> revealed that the platform-switching concept is an effective factor on mechanical properties of implant-abutment complex rather than the loadinduced stresses developed at the marginal bone around implants. However, those results were obtained in very simplified models that did not consider the internal geometry of implant-abutment junction in detail.</p><p>In agreement with previous studies [32, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">44,</ref><ref type="bibr">45]</ref>, it was confirmed that wide platform implants show a lower stress value and more favorable stress distribution compared to regular platform implants. It seems that increasing the implant diameter enhances the contact between the implant and the bone that dramatically reduced stress concentration <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[44]</ref>. Interestingly, the platform-switching models of both implant systems still showed lower stress values than wide platform configurations. In other words, stress distribution was influenced more by the platform switching concept than the implant diameter. Hsu et al.</p><p>[36] in a strain gauge analysis of immediately loaded implants concluded that bone strain was reduced more by increasing the diameter of the implant than by using platform switching. However, one should keep in mind that in the present study, similar to most of the previous FEA studies, models of delayloaded implants were used, in which there was an ideal osseointegration between the surface of the implant and the bone. In addition, some studies reported that the concentration of stress is greater around immediately loaded implants than around delay-loaded implants <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">27]</ref>. The present study also indicated that in both implant systems, the compressive and tensile stresses were lower in platform-switching models than conventional models at the compact bone in the vicinity of the implant neck.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2)</ref>. To construct a finite element model, it is usually necessary to simplify the system by making some assumptions. The implants and bone used in the models were considered to be isotropic, homogeneous and linearly elastic and the occlusal forces were static. Furthermore, in the present study, the bone-implant contact was 100%, but in vivo, bone-implant contact percentages usually range from 30% to 70%. Thus, the final models represented an average clinical situation, and generalization of its results should be done with care. Therefore, because the finite element models used in this study do not identically reproduce all clinical situations, the application of the results should be tempered with sound clinical judgment.</p></div>
