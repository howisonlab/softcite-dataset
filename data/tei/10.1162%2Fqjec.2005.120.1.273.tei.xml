<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Since its premiere in the fall of 1993, Artificial Life has become the unifying forum for the exchange of scientific information on the study of man-made systems that exhibit the behavioral characteristics of natural living systems. These systems can be synthesized in software, hardware, or wetware. Each issue features international research that spans the hierarchy of biological organization, including studies of the origin of life, self-assembly, growth and development, evolutionary and ecological dynamics, animal and robot behavior, social organization, and cultural evolution.</p><p>The journal shapes and chronicles the development of artificial life, extending the horizons of empirical research in biology beyond the territory circumscribed by life-as-we-know-it and into the domain of life-as-it-could-be.</p><p>Artificial Life is the official journal of the International Society for Artificial Life (ISAL). Subscriptions to AL include ISAL membership.</p></div>

This field attracts psychologists, physicists, computer scientists, neuroscientists, and artificial intelligence investigators working on the neural systems underlying perception, emotion, cognition and behavior, and artificial neural systems that have similar capabilities. Powerful new experimental technologies being developed by the BRAIN Initiative will produce large, complex data sets, and rigorous statistical analysis and theoretical insight will be essential for understanding what these data mean. Timely, short communications, full-length research articles, and reviews focus on advances in the field and cover all aspects of neural computation. </p></div>

Presence appeals to a wide audience that includes computer scientists, high-tech artists and media people, psychologists involved in the study of human-machine interfaces and sensorimotor/cognitive behavior, and mechanical and electrical engineers. ARTMargins publishes scholarly articles and essays about contemporary art, media, architecture, and critical theory. ARTMargins studies art practices and visual culture in the emerging global margins, from North Africa and the Middle East to the Americas, Eastern and Western Europe, Asia and Australasia. The journal seeks a forum for scholars, theoreticians, and critics from a variety of disciplines who are interested in art and politics in transitional countries and regions; postsocialism and neo-liberalism; postmodernism and postcolonialism, and their critiques; and the problem of global art and global art history and its methodologies. Computer Music Journal is published quarterly with an annual sound and video anthology containing curated music¹. For four decades, it has been the leading publication about computer music, concentrating fully on digital sound technology and all musical applications of computers. This makes it an essential resource for musicians, composers, scientists, engineers, computer enthusiasts and anyone exploring the wonders of computer-generated sound.</p></div>

Through studies, publications, and programs on science, engineering, and technology; global security and international affairs; the humanities, arts, and education; and American institutions and the public good, the Academy examines the most pressing problems facing our nation and the world. The first American academic journal to examine design history, theory, and criticism, Design Issues provokes inquiry into the cultural and intellectual issues surrounding design. Regular features include theoretical and critical articles by professional and scholarly contributors, extensive book and exhibition reviews, and visual sequences. Special guest-edited issues concentrate on particular themes, such as design history, human-computer interface, service design, organization design, design for development, and product design methodology. Scholars, students, and professionals in all the design fields are readers of each issue. Design Issues is a peer-reviewed journal. PubPub is a collaborative publication environment with rich commenting features, and powerful, intuitive authoring tools. JoDS articles are authored directly within the PubPub environment, which provides support for multimedia, image integration, and large data sets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pricing Individual</head><p>Unlike journals that operate within a formal peer review system and rigid disciplinary framework, JoDS invites jargon-free communication across all fields of design and science, unconventional formats, and widespread community participation. JoDS empowers authors to engage in fruitful, ongoing discussion about their work with members of many different communities, both within and outside of their home disciplines.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Non-Member Individual</head><p>AEP selects articles from open submissions and solicits articles from the top experts in the fields that are of high contemporary interest. Authors present their analyses at the Asian Economic Panel, which convenes thrice yearly in different parts of the world. The panel, which held its first meeting in April of 2001, invites about 40 leading economists from all over the world to each meeting to discuss the subjects of that particular meeting. AEP makes its publication decisions after reviewing the revised papers. Ongoing public policy developments affecting educational institutions and systems present education policy makers, administrators, and researchers with new global challenges and opportunities. To aid in the deliberations, and help frame the intellectual discourse on education policy and practice, Education Finance and Policy promotes understanding of the means by which global resources can be justly generated and productively engaged to enhance human learning at all levels.</p></div>
