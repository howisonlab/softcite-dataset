<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The mechanical property of extracellular matrix and cell-supporting substrates is known to modulate neuronal growth, differentiation, extension and branching. Here we show that substrate stiffness is an important microenvironmental cue, to which mouse hippocampal neurons respond and integrate into synapse formation and transmission in cultured neuronal network. Hippocampal neurons were cultured on polydimethylsiloxane substrates fabricated to have similar surface properties but a 10-fold difference in Young's modulus. Voltage-gated Ca <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> channel currents determined by patch-clamp recording were greater in neurons on stiff substrates than on soft substrates. Ca <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> oscillations in cultured neuronal network monitored using time-lapse single cell imaging increased in both amplitude and frequency among neurons on stiff substrates. Consistently, synaptic connectivity recorded by paired recording was enhanced between neurons on stiff substrates. Furthermore, spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic activity became greater and more frequent in neurons on stiff substrates. Evoked excitatory transmitter release and excitatory postsynaptic currents also were heightened at synapses between neurons on stiff substrates. Taken together, our results provide compelling evidence to show that substrate stiffness is an important biophysical factor modulating synapse connectivity and transmission in cultured hippocampal neuronal network. Such information is useful in designing instructive scaffolds or supporting substrates for neural tissue engineering. I t is well-known that all types of cells are able to detect and respond to extracellular and intracellular chemical signals. Recent studies have evidence to suggest many cells including neurons in the brain are also equipped to sense mechanical cues from their microenvironments such as the stiffness or rigidity of extracellular matrix or cell-supporting substrates, and result in profound effects on their morphology and function <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> . For instance, substrates with stiffness similar to brain tissues prefer to stimulate neuronal over glial growth in cortical neuronal cultures <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> . The mechanical property of neuron-supporting substrates also exerts considerable influence on important neuronal behaviors; taking hippocampal neurons for example, stiff substrates promote dendrite arborization and, by contrast, soft substrates render weak adhesion that assists neurite outgrowth and/or retraction and thereby increase the frequency of extension-retraction events and neuronal dynamics <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> . Furthermore, there is increasing evidence to suggest that the physical properties of substrates can tune synapse formation and strength in cultured neuronal network although the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> . Brain injury or neurodegenerative disease can change local or global stiffness of the brain tissues, for example, local tissue stiffness is likely to increase after injury, as a result of formation of structures such as glial scars, and decrease in the brain tissues of patients with Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> . These and other studies have led to recognition of the mechanical property as an important factor in designing instructive scaffolds for neural tissue engineering <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> . A clear understanding of how the mechanical property of neuron-supporting substrates influences neuronal function is still lacking but important in inspiring a full insight into brain function and in particular development of novel neuron-supporting scaffolds for neural tissue engineering or regeneration <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> . We carried out the present study to investigate the effects of substrate stiffness on Ca 21 signaling, synapse connectivity and transmission in cultured hippocampal neuronal network.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>OPEN</head><p>SUBJECT AREAS:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">NEURAL CIRCUIT TISSUE ENGINEERING</formula><p>priate for study of the mechano-sensitivity of cellular processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> . Indeed, our two types of PDMS substrate preparations had similar surface roughness or topography as revealed using atomic force microscopy ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1a)</ref>, but a 10-fold difference in Young's modulus (46 6 11 kPa versus 457 6 39 kPa; n 5 6) as determined using the spherical indentation method (see Materials and Methods). We referred to them from here onwards as the soft and stiff substrates, respectively. Hippocampal neurons cultured on such substrates over a period of 14-18 days showed the typical size of cell body, morphology, neurite growth and extension. Neurites grew in all directions and with varying distances, and a high proportion of them made contacts with each other in the later stage ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1b-d</ref>). Further characterization by immunofluorescent confocal microscopy using antibodies that recognize MAP2 (a neuronal marker), vesicular glutamate transporter (vGLUT1) (a marker of excitatory neurons using glutamate) or GAD67 (a maker for inhibitory neurons using c-aminobutyric acid or GABA) shows no difference in neuron density, soma size, and percentage of excitatory and inhibitory neurons on stiff and soft substrates ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1c-e</ref>).</p><p>Cytosolic Ca <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> is a ubiquitous signaling molecule, and neurons express numerous Ca 21 signaling mechanisms that play a crucial role in determining and regulating their functional roles <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> . Voltage-gated Ca <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> channels mediating Ca 21 influx into the presynaptic terminals are particularly important for synaptic transmission <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> . Thus, we firstly examined the effect of substrate stiffness on voltage-gated Ca <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> channels in hippocampal neurons in culture for 8-10 days in vitro (DIV8-10), using whole-cell patch-clamp recording and Ba <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> as the charge carrier to avoid perturbance of Ca 21 -dependent mechanisms. Neurons cultured on both substrates responded to depolarization pulses with non-inactivating currents <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 2a)</ref>. The current-voltage (I-V) relationship curves were bell-shaped; the inward currents began to appear approximately at 230 mV, reached the maximum at 25 mV and reversed at 150 mV <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 2b)</ref>. The amplitude of inward currents in the voltage range from 215 mV to 115 mV was significantly greater in neurons on stiff substrates as compared to that in neurons on soft substrates <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 2b)</ref>. Similar increases in voltage-gated Ca <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> channel currents in nerve growth factor-differentiated PC12 pheochromocytoma cells ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2c-d</ref>), a cell model for neuronal function. Taken together, these results suggest up-regulation of neuronal voltage-gated Ca <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> channels by stiff substrates.</p><p>Hippocampal neurons as they mature in vivo or in vitro develop spontaneous oscillations in the cytosolic Ca <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> concentrations  <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> oscillation as a result of synapse formation in neuronal network <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> . We combined time lapse microscopy and Fura-2 ratiometry to investigate the effect of substrate stiffness on basal [Ca 21 ] c and Ca 21 oscillation in DIV14-18 neurons ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3a-c)</ref>. The basal [Ca 21 ] c were similar in neurons cultured on soft and stiff substrates ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3d</ref>). Ca 21 oscillations were observed in a majority of neurons but neurons on stiff substrates exhibited significant increases in both frequency and amplitude ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3e-f</ref>) with no discernible change in synchronization <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. 3g</ref>).</p><p>Ca <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> oscillations have been shown to be mediated by excitatory and inhibitory neurons or synapses in the neuronal networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> . To further study the effects of substrate stiffness on synapse formation and function, we recorded spontaneous excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sEPSC and sIPSC) from DIV14-18 neurons. The results are summarized in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 4</ref>. There were significant increases in both amplitude and frequency of sEPSC in neurons on stiff substrates ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 4b-c</ref>) and by contrast no effect on sIPSC was detected ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 4e-f</ref>). We also determined the synaptic connectivity directly by paired recording <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 5a</ref>) on the basis that action potentials (APs), induced by injecting currents into one (or presynaptic) neuron, evoke neurotransmitter release and subsequent postsynaptic currents in another synaptically coupled (postsynaptic) neuron. The average percentage of synaptic connectivity among neurons on stiff substrates was significantly greater than that among neurons on soft substrates <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 5b</ref>). More specifically, stiff substrates increased both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic connectivity <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 5c</ref>). All the synaptic connectivity was completely abolished in extracellular Ca 21 -free solutions (data not shown), consistent with a critical role of Ca <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> influx in inducing synaptic transmission. We also examined the electrical coupling between neurons. The prevalence of electrical coupling and the coupling coefficient were not altered by substrate stiffness <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 5d-f</ref>). Finally, we compared AP-evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSC) and inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSC), and also paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) or depression (PPD) that are often indicative of vesicular release probability (Pr) of neurotransmitters with a lower Pr resulting in a greater PPF or PPD value <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> . The cumulative distribution of postsynaptic currents shows that the size of evoked EPSC was increased significantly in neurons on stiff substrates relative to that in neurons on soft substrates <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 5g</ref>). The PPF value was, as expected, significantly lower for neurons on stiff substrates (1.12 6 0.07) than on soft substrates (1.38 6 0.08; p , 0.05) ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 5h</ref>), consistent with enhanced excitatory synaptic transmission. In contrast, there was no change in evoked IPSC and PPD value ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 5i-j)</ref>. Collectively, these results provide consistent evidence to show that stiff substrates preferentially enhance the excitatory synaptic connectivity and transmission in cultured hippocampal neuronal network.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The present study provides evidence to show that substrate stiffness strongly enhances voltage-gated Ca <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> channel currents, Ca 21 oscillations, synaptic connectivity, and excitatory neurotransmission in cultured hippocampal neuronal networks. As mentioned above, neurons express a diversity of Ca 21 signaling mechanisms that are important for brain functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> , including presynaptic voltage-gated Ca 21 channels to mediate transmission at synapses, and synchronized Ca 21 oscillations in neuronal networks to determine neuronal plasticity. Diverse extrinsic chemical signals and intrinsic mechanisms exist at both presynaptic and postsynaptic sites to determine or modulate synaptic formation and transmission <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> . For example, expression of cadherin-9 is crucial for synapse formation between dentate gyrus and CA3 neurons in hippocampus <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> and neuropeptides via activation of distinctive Gprotein-coupled receptors can alter the amplitude and/or frequency of Ca 21 oscillations and thereby neuronal plasticity <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> . Emergent evidence suggests that the physical properties of neuron-supporting substrates are also influential. Thus, culturing neuronal stem celldifferentiated neurospheres on graphene, as opposed to tissue culture plastic surface, enhanced synchronized spontaneous Ca 21 oscillations and postsynaptic currents <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> . Stretching the membranes which supported cortical neurons significantly reduced spontaneous Ca <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> oscillations and excitatory postsynaptic currents <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> . The present study examined hippocampal neurons cultured on substrates with different stiffness, and revealed that the stiff substrates significantly upregulated Ca 21 signaling mechanisms, including voltage-gated Ca 21 channels <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 2</ref>) and synchronized spontaneous Ca 21 oscillations <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Figs. 3)</ref>. More importantly, our study has shown that the stiff substrates enhanced synaptic connectivity and excitatory synaptic trans-mission ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figs. 4-5</ref>). To our best knowledge, this is the first study to show that neurons can sense mechanical cues from their microenvironments and integrate into synapse connectivity and transmission. The increases in both Ca 21 channel activity <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 2)</ref> and synaptic connectivity induced by the stiff substrates <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 5b)</ref>, and no detectable synaptic connectivity in extracellular Ca <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> -free solutions support the importance of Ca 21 signalling or presynaptic Ca 21 influx through voltage-gated Ca 21 channels. The stiff substrates also stimulated synchronized spontaneous Ca 21 oscillations in cultured neuronal network <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. 3)</ref>, and facilitated excitatory synaptic connectivity and transmission <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Fig. 4a-c, Fig. 5c</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 5g-h</ref>). These findings are consistent with the notion that the Ca 21 oscillations result from periodic burst firing of APs engaging excitatory synaptic transmission via activation of L-type voltage-gated Ca 21 channels and excitatory NMDA receptors <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> . The excitatory GABA A receptors in the neonatal hippocampus have been reported to mediate the Ca <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> oscillations in synergy with NMDA receptors <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> . This study has shown that the stiff substrates also enhanced the inhibitory synaptic connectivity <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 5c</ref>) but did not alter the inhibitory synaptic transmission ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 4d-f</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 5i-j)</ref>. Further investigations are required to determine the contribution of the excitatory and inhibitory receptors in mediating the increases in the Ca <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> oscillations and the discriminating effects on the excitatory versus inhibitory synaptic transmission. The increases in spontaneous Ca <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> oscillations on stiff substrates have also been documented in other cell types; for example, spontaneous cytosolic Ca 21 oscillations became more frequent in human mesenchymal stem cells when cultured on stiff polyacrylamide gel substrates or were amplified in endothelial cells when migrating from soft to stiff region of the substrates <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> . It is thus attractive to propose tuning the frequency and/or amplitude of cytosolic Ca <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> oscillations as a common intrinsic mechanism which cells use to encode the difference and/or change in the mechanical property of their microenvironments. Neurons examined in the present study were supported directly by the substrates based on visual examination <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 1b)</ref>. The stiff substrates increased the voltage-gated Ca <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> channel currents in cultured hippocampal neurons ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2a-b)</ref> and similarly in nerve growth factor-differentiated PC12 cells ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2c-d)</ref>. Taken together, these results support expression of intrinsic mechano-sensing mechanisms in neurons. Nevertheless, it is worth pointing out that our hippocampal neuronal preparations like those used in many previous studies contained glial cells, and thus we cannot exclude the intriguing possibility that the glial cells have a role in sensing the mechanical cues and relaying to co-existing neurons. The PDMS substrates used in this present study are similar to those in previous studies, particularly those focusing on tissue engineering, and the substrate stiffness is much higher than the overall stiffness of brain tissues <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> . While it is important to determine the effects of changing the substrate stiffness occurring to the brain tissues on synaptic formation and function, the interesting finding reported in the present study is useful for the development of novel instructive scaffolds for neural tissue engineering.</p><p>The mechano-sensing mechanisms are currently still poorly understood, despite several cytoskeletal and signaling proteins have been identified in various cell types, including receptor-like protein tyrosine phosphatase 4 , integrins <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> , RhoA <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> and GAP-43 <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> as well as mechano-sensitive ion channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> . In addition, there is evidence suggesting that the effect of substrate stiffness on dendrite arborization is mediated by glutamate receptors <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> . More investigations are clearly required to identify the neuronal voltage-gated Ca <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> channels that are up-regulated by stiff substrates, and particularly elucidate the mechano-sensing mechanisms that enhance voltage-gated Ca <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> channel function, synaptic connectivity, excitatory synaptic transmission, and synchronized spontaneous Ca 21 oscillations we have reported here in cultured hippocampal neuronal network.</p><p>In summary, we have shown stiffness of cell-supporting substrates can strongly modulate excitatory synaptic connectivity and transmission in cultured hippocampal neuronal network. Such findings are useful for design of instructive scaffolds to be used in neural tissue engineering as well as to inspire a new insight into brain functions and mechanisms of diseases that change extracellular matrix compliance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p>Preparation and characterization of PDMS substrates. PDMS curing agent (sylgard184; Dow corning Corp) were mixed with base agent in a mass ratio of 1051 or 5051 in 15-ml centrifugal tubes, and centrifuged in a bench-top centrifuge to remove air bubbles. The mixture of ,100 ml was transferred using a pipette onto the top of four 12-mm coverslips in a 35-mm petri dish and left at 65uC for 12 hrs; the resulting PDMS substrates were oxidized in an oxygen plasma cleaner, which generated silanol group (Si-OH) on the surface of the PDMS, then sterilized by UV radiation for 2 hrs, coated with fibronectin and left in a laminar flow cabinet for at least 2 hrs. The PDMS-coverslips were washed extensively with sterile water and dried before being used to culture hippocampal neurons as described previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> . The substrate surface topography was examined using atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Nanoscope IIIa system, Digital Instruments, Santa Barbara, CA, USA) in a tapping mode with 512 3 512 pixel data acquisition and 1 Hz scan speed. The AFM images were recorded with a standard silicon tip on a cantilever beam. The cantilever had a spring constant of 50 pN/nm, and was 125 mm long with a resonant frequency of 300 kHz.</p><p>The Young's modulus of the substrates was determined using the spherical indentation method and ElectroForceH3100 test instrument (Bose, Shanghai, China) as described previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> . In brief, the samples had a diameter of 55 mm and a height of 15 mm. The spherical indenter of 3-mm radius was used. The loading procedures were undertaken with controlled displacement, and the loading rate was set at 2 mm/ s and the maximum indentation depth at 3 mm. Measurements were undertaken at six different positions of the sample, and the depth-indentation load curves were recorded. The initial shear modulus was determined by fitting the load curves up to different ratios of h/R using the following equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">P~1 6 9 E ffiffiffiffiffi ffi Rh p h 1{0:15 h R ,</formula><p>where P represents indentation load, E Young's modulus, h indentation depth and R indenter radius <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> .</p><p>Hippocampal neuron culture preparation and PC12 cell culture. All animal procedures were in accordance with the guidelines approved by Tsinghua University. Mouse hippocampal neurons were isolated from one day old pups as previously described <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> . In brief, after the blood vessels and meninges were removed, the hippocampus was collected into tubes in cold Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS), and rinsed twice with HBSS solutions. Tissues were digested in TrypIE (Sigma) for 15 min at 37uC and gently triturated using pipette tips to cell suspension in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 2% B-27 (Life Technologies). Cells were seeded approximately 6000 cells/cm 2 and were maintained at 37uC in humidified atmosphere with 5% CO 2 . Arabinofuranosyl cysteine at 1 mg/ ml was added to culture medium 2-3 days after initial seeding to inhibit glial proliferation. PC12 cells were seeded on substrates and culture in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 50 ng/ml nerve growth factor (Sigma) for 8-10 days before use.</p><p>Immunofluorescence staining and confocal imaging. This was performed at room temperature except incubation with the primary antibody at 4uC. DIV14 cells were washed with phosphate buffered solutions (PBS), fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min and then permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 (Sigma) in PBS for 5 min. After extensive washing with PBS, cells were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 60 min, and incubated with primary rabbit polyclonal MAP2 antibody (Abcam) at a dilution of 15500 alone, or together with mouse monoclonal GAD67 antibody (Millipore) at 15200 or mouse monoclonal vGLUT1 (Millipore) at 15200 overnight. After extensive wash with PBS, cells were incubated with secondary Alexa Fluor568 goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Molecular Probes) at 151000 alone or with Alexa Fluor488 goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Molecular Probes) at 151000 for 60 min. Fluorescence images were captured using a fluorescence microscope (TCS SP5, Leica Microsystems).</p><p>Patch-clamp recording. Whole-cell currents were recorded from DIV8-10 neurons at room temperature, using an Axopatch 200B amplifier and pClamp software version 10.0 (Axon Instruments). The patched cells were perfused at 0. In some experiments, extracellular solutions without CaCl 2 were used. Spontaneous postsynaptic currents were recorded with the membrane potential held at 270 mV for 5 min. AP-evoked postsynaptic currents and paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) or depression (PPD) were determined by paired recording without capacitance compensation as previously described <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> . The presynaptic neurons were depolarized to 0 mV for 1 ms to elicit APs at 10-s intervals. The unitary postsynaptic currents were recorded from the paired postsynaptic neurons at a holding potential of 270 mV. 30 AP-evoked EPSC and IPSC were recorded from each neuron. Evoked EPSC and IPSC exhibited different decay kinetics, with average rise and decay times of 3 6 0.3 ms and 24 6 2.6 ms for EPSC (n 5 18), and 4 6 0.4 ms and 184 6 12.4 ms for IPSC (n 5 16), respectively. PPF was determined by evoking two EPSC at a 50-ms interval and PPD by evoking two IPSC at a 200-ms interval. To minimize the potential effects of spatial proximity on synaptic connectivity, paired recordings were made from a pair of neurons in the distance of 100-150 mm.</p><p>Electrical coupling. The electrical coupling between neurons was examined using the protocols described previously by Lefler et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40</ref> . A hyperpolarizing current of 300 or 500 pA was delivered to the presynaptic neuron and measured the ensuing changes in membrane potential in both neurons. The ratio of the steady-state change in membrane potential in the presynaptic neuron to that in the postsynaptic neuron was calculated as the electrical coupling coefficient (CC). The CC value of ,0.002 is indicative of no electrical coupling.</p><p>Statistical analysis. The data were presented as mean 6 s.e.m., where appropriate. The neuron density was derived from MAP2-positive cells that were counted in fluorescent images and converted to the number of neurons per mm 2 , and the soma area of individual MAP2-positive cells was estimated, using ImageJ. The percentage of excitatory and inhibitory neurons was obtained by visually identifying the number of MAP2-positive and vGLUT1-positive neurons or MAP2-positive and GAD67positive neurons, and divided by the number of MAP2-positive neurons examined. The peak Ba 21 currents were normalized to the cell membrane capacitance and presented as current density. To determine the basal Ca 21 level and cytosolic Ca <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> oscillations, cells with the basal F340/F380 value within the average 6 2 3 standard deviation were included in analysis, and a Ca 21 spike was defined with its amplitude being .1.2 times of the basal level. The number of Ca 21 oscillation per minute and the changes in F340/F380 were used to calculate the frequency and amplitude. Spontaneous postsynaptic currents were analyzed using Clampfit (Molecular Devices) and Mini Analysis Progrom (Synaptosoft). The last 10 AP-evoked EPSCs and IPSCs were averaged to obtain the postsynaptic current amplitude which was used to construct the cumulative distribution as described previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> . PPF value was derived by the ratio of the second EPSC over the first EPSC and PPD value by the ratio of the second IPSC over the first IPSC. Statistical analysis was conducted using Student's t-test for the mean data and using Kolmogorov-Smirnov for the cumulative distribution of spontaneous and evoked EPSC and IPSC, with the difference to be considered significant at p , 0.05.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 |</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Surface topography of PDMS substrates and effect of substrate stiffness on neuronal cultures.

The resistance of recording pipettes in extracellular solution was 3.0-4.0 MV. The membrane potential was held at 280 mV and series resistance compensated by 80%. Currents were evoked by applying test pulses of 275 mV to 1100 mV with 40-s duration and an increment of 5 mV at 10-s intervals. The cell capacitance (32 6 12 pF) and series resistance (,20 MV) were monitored throughout the recording. Signals were filtered at 1 kHz and digitized at 10 kHz. The leak currents were corrected using the online P/6 trace subtraction. Cytosolic Ca 21 measurement. Cytosolic Ca 21 concentrations in DIV14-18 neurons were measured at room temperature using Fura-2 ratiometric method. In brief, neurons were incubated with 2 mM Fura-2/acetoxymethyl ester (Life Technologies) in DMEM culture medium at 37uC for 30 min, followed by washing three times with phosphate buffer saline. Cells bathed in MEM with 2% FBS were placed on the stage of an Olympus IX71 inverted microscope equipped with a Xenon illumination system and an IMAGO CCD camera (Till Photonics, Germany).
