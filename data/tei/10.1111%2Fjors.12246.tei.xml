<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Geocomputation: A Practical Primer is a timely book whose content will appear obvious in a few years time but would have probably seemed unusual, to say the least, just a few years ago. Its publication coincides with many substantial changes and shifts occurring in the world of computation, science, and geographic data. Although those are subjects for a different discussion, a few examples will help contextualize the moment in which this book has come about. Computing has been moving away from the desktop for a few years now: lighter, everyday tasks are pushed into ever smaller devices (tablets, smartphones, wearables, etc.), while more heavy-duty jobs are reserved for servers, data-warehouses, or somewhere else, all of it blurred through the convenience of the cloud. At the same time, the scientific endeavor is experiencing a crisis of public trust and reliability and more open and reproducible approaches are being proposed as the best way to keep science credible and useful for society <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Peng, 2011)</ref>. The data deluge produced by the digital era we live in is shifting the interest from classical statistical methods designed for "reliable little data" to machine learning and pattern recognition techniques created for "messy big data." Closer to the discipline of geography, there is a strong push to take cartography from static publication-ready formats onto the web, opening the door for engaging interactive features and much richer presentations. How these and other changes will affect geocomputation is unclear. Some will probably pass and soon be forgotten, while some others will foreseeably remain with us and, in the process, redefine the way we understand the discipline. With such uncertainty ahead, the temptation to write a "classical" book, one that relies on the topics, methods, and approaches we have "known and loved" for decades, is very strong. Fortunately, that was not the route chosen by Brunsdon and Singleton.</p><p>Instead, the editors took a braver approach by reconciling some of the classical themes in the field that will arguably remain relevant in the future (as they represent the core upon which much of the new approaches build), and blending them with more recent approaches that only few would have seen coming just a few years ago. The book is structured around four blocks of three to four chapters each, revolving around common broad topics but mixing more theoretical approaches with eminently practical articles. The first part, "Describing how the world looks," considers geocomputational approaches to representing the world, from the very microlevel, such as the one on 3D geosimulation (Torrens, chapter 2), to very macrolevel views on rank size and power laws (Batty, chapter 3). "Exploring movements in space," part 2, considers several approaches to the blending of space and time, as well as dynamic modeling. Topics like the combination of agentbased modeling and Geographic Information Science (GIS) (Crooks, chapter 4), or microsimulation (Harland and Birkin, chapter 5), find their place in this part of the book, but so do more general overviews about circular statistics (Rohde and Corcoran, chapter 7) or storage, management, and analysis of large space-time datasets (Miller, chapter 6). In part 3, "Making geographical decisions," the editors have compiled a set of geocomputational techniques used in real-world applications to solve specific problems. This comprises geodemographics (Alexiou and Singleton, chapter 8), self-organizing maps (Spielman and Folch, chapter 9), kernel densities (Lewis, chapter 10), and location-allocation models (Tomintz, Clarke, Alfadhi, chapter 11). These are usually illustrated with a practical application, rather than merely described in abstract terms, which makes the reading much more intuitive and serves as a good starter for the nonexperienced reader interested in discovering the "big picture" of the techniques.</p><p>The fourth block of the volume, "Explaining how the world works," delves into confirmatory approaches that seek to provide insight into underlying social or natural processes. Two good examples are chapter 12 on Geographically Weighted GLMs (Nakaya) and chapter 13 on spatial interaction models (Morrisey). The final section, "Enabling interactions," covers several examples of new avenues for geocomputation that would have not normally been part of a more traditional book. Topics such as the use of crowd-sourced datasets (Brunsdon and Comber, chapter 16) or public participation through GIS (Kingston, chapter 18) can be found here.</p><p>In addition to these thematic blocks, a most welcome feature of the book is the series of chapters intelligently inserted in each block that cover aspects of geocomputation referring to tools and software. In particular, it is refreshing to see how all of these relate to open-source projects freely available to use. The landscape where the only choices to perform geocomputational analyses were proprietary, desktop, point-and-click, GIS programs, or custom routines in low-level languages such as C or FORTRAN is no longer the norm. Instead, an entire ecosystem of open-source software, more flexible than traditional desktop GIS and more accessible than low-level computer programming has emerged. Just a few years ago, it was not very clear that one day it would be possible to carry out serious research in geocomputation using only free and/or open-source software. That the field has evolved in this direction to a point where there is a full stock of tools <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Rey, 2009</ref>) that realize such a vision is greatly inspiring and it is something that the larger community of researchers who have made it possible should feel proud of. The book contains an overview of open-source software for GIS (O'Brien, chapter 17), and two other chapters are devoted to the most common programming languages used in geocomputation, R (Cheshire and Lovelace, chapter 1) and Python <ref type="bibr">(Rey,</ref><ref type="bibr">chapter 14)</ref>. An additional chapter (15) by Brunsdon and Singleton elaborates on the idea of reproducibility, describing the concept, why it should be adopted, and how it can be realistically implemented. This bit echoes a larger debate that relates to the very core of what Science is about and how to keep it serving society in the 21st century, and its inclusion in the book is a reassuring sign of the forward-looking attitude of the editors.</p><p>There is much to like in this book. For a domain so wide, diverse, and eclectic as geocomputation, the selection of topics does a remarkable job of capturing some key themes, applications, and domains where geocomputational approaches are used and useful. This is further enhanced by the fact that the text lives up to the "practical" in its title: instead of delving into the thorough math underlying many of these techniques, each chapter presents the intuition and application, making it a very suitable companion for a graduate seminar in social sciences (e.g., economics or sociology), or for researchers from different disciplines with an interest in what geocomputation has to offer to them. Part of this success in meeting its own goals is undoubtedly related to the fact that the authors are among the key leaders in the field they are writing about, and thus are particularly well placed to write introductory texts that get to the essence without much of the underlying math. However, this is nicely complemented by a short section at the end of each chapter with a few key references for the interested reader to continue learning about the topic. Most of these do include some of the equation-heavy books and articles required to master these techniques, making the book a perfect introduction-a primer after all-with a clear path forward for the interested minds.</p><p>At a more global level, the book recognizes and embraces many of the "big picture" shifts occurring in the field and accommodates them throughout the book. In addition to the already mentioned new approaches to geocomputational software and tools, there is an explicit recognition that the data landscape is changing and that this will require adaptation to be able to extract the most value and knowledge. This is very clear in parts of the book, such as chapter 9 (Miller), which recognize the need to accommodate and properly represent these new forms of data. But it is also more subtly present in the choice of methods reviewed. For example, the inclusion of a chapter on self-organizing maps, a machine learning technique to reduce data dimensionality and visualize large complex datasets, is very much in that same spirit. Very welcome is also the role given by the editors to visualization. One could argue that graphics have always been an essential part of GIS and, by extension, geocomputation. However, it is easy to get lost in the complexity and computational aspects of some of the methodologies and assume that because the results come from very complicated techniques, the presentation of such results is of secondary importance. The book takes a clear stance on this and recognizes not only its importance, but its nontriviality, including chapters that walk the reader through some of the cutting-edge tools such as R, Python, or JavaScript libraries for the web.</p><p>As much as there is to praise about this edited volume, one can always wish for more. Arguably, the following are a reflection of my own interests and preferences, but I do think they would have made the book a slightly more complete and consistent one. I have two main remarks: one relating to the structure and the other one to the content. I think there could have been a bit more consistency in the structure of each chapter. While some chapters are practical applications of a particular method, others are a more conceptual overview. To some extent, this is unavoidable in an edited volume with so many and varied authors, and some would argue even desirable as it exposes the reader to a larger range of approaches and ways of understanding the field, and I agree. However, I think a more consistent presentation of different methods provides a better way to introduce the unfamiliar reader to a family of new techniques. I would have also enjoyed some discussion of how geocomputation does or should engage with the nascent discipline of data science. Data science is in some ways a buzz term around which there is much hype and in that sense, it is correct not to give it much attention as the risk of the fashion fading soon is too high. However, the strong emphasis it places on practical applications and the use of data and quantitative techniques in industry and policy warrant some respect. A chapter on how geocomputation fits into the field of data science and how this can help make the discipline even more useful and valuable would have been very welcome.</p><p>Geocomputation is a vibrant field that is constantly reimagining and reinventing itself, influenced by several technological and scientific advances, but also feeding back into those arenas. Because of that, the discipline should be of interest not only for experts on these computational techniques, but also to a wide variety of students and researchers in the natural and social sciences. Particularly for those, the book is an excellent introduction that will provide a good overview of what is on offer, and how to make the most of it. Accessibility and spatial interaction are two core concepts in multiple social science fields, including regional science, spatial economics, transportation, geography, and city and regional planning. Although it is well accepted that these two concepts are interconnected, open questions persist on how to use their connections to provide an accurate measurement of one family of indicators (e.g., accessibility) through the other one (e.g., spatial interaction) and to better understand the economic and social benefits of accessibility improvement. The book edited by Condeço-Melhorado, Reggiani, and Gutiérrez attempts to concentrate on these questions by assembling chapters written by leading researchers mainly from Europe.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Accessibility and Spatial Interaction</head><p>This book includes three sections. The first section focuses on advanced data and analytical methodologies to enhance the measurement of accessibility and spatial interaction.Östh, Reggiani, and Galiazzo (chapter 2) articulate the importance of distance-decay functions in computing potential accessibility and spatial interaction measured by the magnitude of flows between locations. When accessibility is not measurable, it can be estimated by spatial interaction models using flow data. They further examine which specification of the distance-decay function is least sensitive to the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP) using Swedish data. These aggregate, social-physics-oriented estimations of accessibility are straightforward but somewhat arbitrary. McArthur, Thorsen, and Ubøe's research (chapter 3) is economics-oriented, developing a spatial general equilibrium model (SGEM) to endogenize the relationship between transportation network, accessibility, and relocations of residents and jobs. This study is particularly useful to understand how a change in transportation network (e.g., removing topographical barriers) affects accessibility, how a change in accessibility leads to relocations of population and employment, and, in turn, how these relocations alter accessibility. Other advantages of SGEM studies are that they can track the change of accessibility and calculate an economically efficient or socially optimal level of accessibility.</p><p>Nicolai and Nagel (chapter 4) present a logsum indicator to compare the spatial distribution of accessibility under different spatial resolutions of locations on the flow origin side in Zurich. It is somewhat disappointing that the authors coarsely treat the spatial resolution of opportunities and overlook an examination of whether the resolutions of opportunities affects the accessibility computation. Given the location of an origin, the measure of accessibility could largely depend on the resolutions of travel opportunities, rather than the origin. Schintler, Kulkarni, Haynes, and Stough (chapter 5) offer an insightful introduction to how to use geosocial data to calculate accessibility and develop several social network analysis (SNA) metrics (i.e., degree, betweenness centrality, and entropy) to identify the positions (or importance) of locations within the U.S. network of counties. They also apply a community detection algorithm to find the "mobility sheds" (p. 107) and identify territories with close spatial interaction. While the SNA approach generates an innovative understanding of accessibility and spatial interaction, the authors mistakenly regard betweenness centrality as accessibility (p. 97). There are particular indicators in SNA that measure accessibility or reachability, e.g., closeness centrality. Also, we would expect a more thorough comparison of the accessibility computation based on the SNA and traditional approach (e.g., potential accessibility indicators).</p><p>The chapters in the second section, "The Social and Spatial Dimension of Accessibility," investigate the spatial and social factors of the accessibility of locations or population groups. De Montis, Caschili, and Trogu (chapter 6) offer a spatial autocorrelation analysis to explore the influence of the accessibility attributes of adjacent counties and regional demographics on the accessibility of U.S. counties. This spatial analysis demonstrates the importance of spatial dependence in accessibility measures but cannot clarify the causality between accessibility and demographics (e.g., whether high population densities attract more infrastructure investment, leading to a high level of accessibility, or high accessibility facilitates population clustering). Salas-Olmedo, Condeço-Melhorado, and Gutiérrez (chapter 7) measure the border effects on intranational and international interaction through manufacturing trade among European nations. They also evaluate how these border effects vary with the distance metrics employed and affect the computation of accessibility (or market potential). Ribeiro, Remoaldo, and Gutiérrez (chapter 8) connect accessibility indexes with transportrelated social exclusion and look at the roles of street slope and walking speed in the accessibility computation of elderly people to public transit in the municipality of Braga, Portugal.</p><p>By its title, the third section of the book appears set to proclaim "accessibility as a driver of spatial interaction," while all three chapters tackle the influence of accessibility on economic activities on the production side only. Arbués, Mayor, and Baños (chapter 9) examine the output effects of the accessibility of road transportation infrastructure, simply measured by the distance-decay sum of the population in all other provinces in Spain. Holl (chapter 10) uses a similar measure of accessibility at the municipality level in Spain also and tests its impact on firm-level total factor productivity. Both chapters rely on panel data models and control for the effects of production externalities, measured by spillovers to neighboring regions (chapter 9) or agglomeration benefits from the denser population (chapter 10). They are solid empirical studies. However, both fail to discuss the endogeneity between accessibility and production externalities: that is, how accessibility could affect spillovers and agglomeration and indirectly affect productivity. As later noted by Gråsjö and Karlsson in the last chapter, the measure of accessibility "incorporates 'global' spillovers and does not only account for the impact from neighbors or locations within a certain distance band" (p. 229). The latter is often done by spatial dependence models (e.g., the spatial Durbin model in chapter 9). Thus, accessibility could play a more important role in spatial economics than spatial dependence. By reviewing various empirical studies in Sweden, Gråsjö and Karlsson further encourage a more extensive application of the accessibility approach in spatial economics studies, including the analysis of knowledge spillovers, spatial variations of productivity and economic growth, new firm formation and locational dynamics, exports, and labor mobility. This is a valuable reminder at the end of the book that there is a complex interplay between accessibility and spatial economics and that the accessibility approach remains overlooked or undervalued in related empirical studies.</p><p>Although the editors believe that what sets this volume apart from other contributions to the scholarship of accessibility is its focus on "the link between spatial interaction and accessibility" (p. 3), only four chapters directly address this important link in theory or empirics (chapters 1-3 and 11). These chapters represent the state of the art but meanwhile highlight the complexity of situating accessibility within the framework of spatial interaction theory. Much more work is needed to investigate how accessibility affects the spatial distribution of opportunities and spatial interaction and, in turn, how they change accessibility. For empirical studies, a reduced-form estimation probably cannot accurately reflect the connection between spatial interaction and accessibility and structural models are needed. Many chapters in this book are useful contributions to help develop accurate accessibility computations, for example, through the articulation of the influence of the functional specification of distance decay, spatial resolutions, topographical and border constraints, and spatial dependence. Is it rather disappointing, however, that the measures of accessibility devised in the spatial economics contributions presented in Section III are oversimplified. The coarseness of these measures of accessibility could lower the credibility of the estimated relationship between accessibility and space economy. Also, this volume would have benefitted from a review (or synthesis) of the state of the art in accessibility measurement across different empirical applications either at the beginning or at the end of the volume.</p><p>Overall, the book is a welcome addition to the study of accessibility and spatial interaction. It will appeal to regional scientists, spatial economists, and transportation engineers who are interested in the measurement and properties of spatial accessibility and the complex connection between accessibility and spatial economics. The book would be a useful text to support graduate courses in spatial and transport analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Wenjia Zhang Department of Geography and Earth</head><p>Sciences University of North Carolina at Charlotte careful witnesses, and prospective reflections on the "colonization of areas by a middle class thirst for authenticity"-as amenity migration is named in a quote of Lawrence Moss (p. 83).</p><p>The divide is either "living in the countryside," as the amenity migrants want to do, or "living from the countryside" as historical settlers always did, to serve themselves and outsiders, with their resources, tools, deeds, and beliefs, and also to migrate when the competitiveness of their services to outsiders changed due to outside causes. This idea of competing and schizophrenic uses of "mother land" is also in the book where the difference is highlighted between regions of consumption of amenities and regions of production that, jointly with the environment, created and sustained those amenities <ref type="bibr">(p. 190)</ref>. What drives this new colonization movement? Does it create sustainable places? What can be done to guarantee such sustainability? Those are the questions addressed by the authors in a long, well-structured, and pleasant to read piece of work.</p><p>Utopian emotions are implicit in all the text and that is probably what makes the reading so interesting. The dedication to the son of the editors, Cézanne, and his generation, is revealing, partly because the painter Cézanne showed how the beauty of the landscape is in the eyes of the painter, and in those who love paintings. Actually, amenity is often taken as beauty (p. 86), but beauty is not necessarily related to good or even to just. Does the landscape and those who created it have a say? Are these locals the creators and the artists? Or are the outsiders that worship and desire the amenities? Is there space for both through Catholic Sunday masses as it is described in the book (p. 92)? Emotive utopians do not seem to care: they reject what was created in the urban fast food culture of workaholic consumers and assume that by slowing down the complex relationships between nature and the self, and between the self and the society, it is possible to create a better world (p. 94).</p><p>Shared Intuitions based on particular cases rather than on sound-generalized evidence from reality is mostly what we can get on amenity migration from this nice book. It is said that amenity migration refers to movements of people from urban areas to rural areas in search of environmental and cultural amenities (p. 67). Nevertheless, the instinct also suggests that it is a process associated with rural gentrification, stimulating the creation of nonshared visions of the same world (p. 75) and distinct ontological universes in the same territory (p. 88). In some cases, peripheral regions can be seen just as specialized residential areas (p. 102) designing inequalities with former settlers while, typically, aiming at a democracy of people living in real places (p. 119).</p><p>Careful Witnesses provide some proof that goes further than the shared intuitions. What makes the argument resistant is the ability of the opinions to fit with common sense related with sources of income, land ownership, and political participation. Regarding the source of income, it is said that the lack of employment in amenity areas has been a problem for those who do not bring other sources of income with them (p. 53); actually, amenity migrants, besides including wealthy and often seasonal migrants (p. 260), also comprise poor people living on minimal income schemes attracted by lower costs of housing in the countryside and with marginal small activities in agriculture and tourism (p. 209). Concerning land ownership, the argument is that rich people from outside buy land as consumption and make land unproductive for traditional uses while changing the local multiplier effects of the land value. All this can be done without any restriction to avoid that process (p. 59) and this is strongly associated with the gradual disappearance of small ethnic communities, long protected or disguised in regions close to remote national borders (p. 241). Finally, vis-à-vis political participation, there is some evidence that although collaborative management is becoming easier through the use of digital technologies (p. 173), seasonal amenity migrants usually do not attend public meetings and do not volunteer for collective works (p. 151) while generating high hidden costs because developing land as properties fragments the ecosystems and creates pressure to protect those fragments from wild fires at the expense of others (p. 177).</p><p>What about prospective thinking? There is not much on that. Mainly worries and divided hearts. Where is rationality when most of the exposition is related to emotions, intuitions, and partial evidence believable though common sense? Even without reason could we make a divide between, on the one hand, the good guys of nomadic, emotional, intuitive and smart authors, and, on the other hand, the folkloric settlers? And vice-versa when the supposed good guys are the bad ones? Labeling places or people as either rural or urban is not particularly useful (p. 273). In fact, there seems to be a flexible cycle of amenity migration-from visitors, to seasonal migrants and to long-term outsiders that then can sell their houses or hand them over to relatives (pp. 288 and 373), eventually generating long-term equilibriums between tradition and globalization (p. 306). As happens in any migration movement, there are the ones that are engaged with the place and the ones that become frustrated and move away (p. 323). In all, amenity migration is both an opportunity and a threat to sustain the integrity of natural ecologies and their symbiotic human communities (p. 11; p. 361).</p><p>The issue is whether some planning is possible to manage spatially defined environments with time-referenced unrooted impacts. Can places be restricted (p. 59)? Do we need to constrain flows of amenity migrants with the intervention of the government (p. 339 and p. 354)? Or we just need constraints on the resource use that sustains the existing settlers (p. 368) and, at the same time, qualify land use planning (p. 403)? The danger, I would say, is to take an ideological and utopian attitude that has guided some public interventions in the countryside.</p><p>This book on global amenity migration provides a very useful and nice to read set of texts that look at the recurring and reinforcing phenomenon of amenity migration from different disciplinary and, sometimes, ideological perspectives and looking at quite a variety of regions around the world. Amenity migration is a cysergic event, good and bad at the same time. On the one hand, it interconnects people and territories raising the value of both. On the other hand, it can degrade those territories with their people because it is based on unrooted and alien cultures that try to "marry" an embedded and often fragile ethos. Like any marriage, it can be paradise or hell. And like marriage, it only works with respect, trust, humbleness, and proximity-or love, using a less politically correct wording.</p><p>In fact, the main problem of the book is that it does not tackle appropriately the two main issues that are at stake when nomadic and sedentary attitudes interact with each other. On the one hand, the spatial dimensions of families and, on the other hand, the interconnected spatial distribution of property rights over localized resources.</p><p>Where are the children that require school services, the elderly that request company and health care, and the unemployed that demand space and opportunity? How are land and property transmitted from generation to generation and what about the sense of belonging is fructified? It seems that the book only talks about new nomadic tribes without family shifting from workaholic nightmares to amenity "pastures" around the world while forgetting the ones that sustain those intrinsically cultural amenities to produce and host relatives and, why not, all the others that like and respect those symbiotic cultural, familiar, creative, environmental, and cysergic landscapes? The contributors to Immigration, Poverty, and Socioeconomic Inequality could hardly be pleased with the current tone accorded these topics in the looming presidential election. Editors David Card and Steven Raphael (as well as many of their contributors) have long produced critically informed research on how and why immigrants impact U.S.-born workers, the significance of demographic and economic shifts, and the socioeconomic trajectories of immigrants over time and across generations. Much of this compilation is more of the same, modeling a rigorously objective, question-led approach to a contentious field, while demonstrating the abundance of ways issues are framed and debated. In addition, the volume provides a timely focus on varying and changing state policies on immigration and welfare, and relatedly on the lives of young immigrants and members of the second generation. Attention to these authors' concerted efforts to answer urgent questions with innovative thoughtful approaches would significantly improve public discourse.</p><p>Card and Raphael's substantial introduction has numerous detailed summary tables illuminating questions from policy and academic circles as well as the data and measurements used to answer them. It is useful on its own merits to any reader seeking a comprehensive introduction to these issues. The book is then divided into four parts, with chapters coming from a well-assembled team of economists, sociologists, geographers, and education and public policy researchers. The authors' understanding of each other's contributions both within and outside of this volume yields analytical dividends beyond disciplinary divides.</p><p>The first part focuses on immigrants in the labor force and the geography of immigrant poverty. Giovanni Peri and Ethan Lewis employ counterfactual simulations to formalize and test arguments of immigrant-native worker substitutability. Peri finds that new low-skilled immigrants diminish the wages of older less-skilled immigrants and Lewis finds similar effects operating through English language skills-but crucially neither finds negative effects for native-born workers. In a volume where geography provides analytical grounding in terms of comparing and disaggregating composition and policy effects across scales, the next two chapters are the most explicit about places. After finding that places with high levels of racial (black/white) segregation are also places of high immigrant segregation with native-born whites, Michael Stoll's intervening variable approach suggests a causal relationship between segregation and English language ability. Mark Ellis, Richard Wright, and Matthew Townley's chapter enquires about the changing relationships between immigrant poverty and changing locations. Their decomposition analysis shows immigrant poverty increased as the most disadvantaged immigrants sorted into lower waged cities pressed into higher poverty by the Great Recession. These authors are all able to test causal hypotheses through experimental models that formally specify relationships and disaggregate groups, places, and time periods.</p><p>The second part of the book concentrates on the socioeconomic progress of immigrants and their children, both across generations and over time. These three studies all focus on Los Angeles, with the first two utilizing the very relevant Immigration and Intergenerational Mobility in Metropolitan Los Angeles (IIMMLA) data. Renee Reichl Luthra and Roger Waldinger analyze group-variant intercepts and slopes of parent-child education and occupation as the interplay of origin country selection of parents and second-generation outcomes. In contrast to conventional upward or downward assimilation accounts, they emphasize significant intergenerational mobility of the second-generation overall, but also posit alternatives such as the "working class incorporation" (p. 201) of children of less educated Mexicans. The other chapters provide in-depth ethnographic investigation of different second-generation outcomes. Lee and Zhou explore the "frames of achievement" (p. 215) that condition 1.5/second-generation Asian success but are largely absent for 1.5/second-generation Mexicans. In a frame that affects some of Lee and Zhou's participants, Gonzales' study of young Mexican-origin adults illuminates the obstacles of undocumented status and how they unfold over a critical period for intergenerational mobility and adult outcomes. These authors stress the significance of parental resources and social and educational context for the large cohort of young adult and nearly adult children of immigrants.</p><p>The third part of the volume focuses on how public policy-from immigration enforcement to employment and welfare restrictions-affects immigrant poverty. Douglas Massey's comprehensive historical analysis catalogues modern immigration policy and its racialized stigmatizing practice toward Mexicans and Mexican Americans. This provides an excellent set text for those unfamiliar with how Mexicans became so different from other immigrant groups but also sets the stage for analysis of contemporary policy shifts. Marianne Bitler and Hilary Hoynes similarly conduct a thorough analysis of how the status quo of relatively poorer immigrant households and children emerged from two decades' worth of increasing limitations on immigrants' access to social welfare. Sara Bohn and Magnus Lofstrum's synthetic comparison examines the probable effects of Arizona's recent Legal Arizona Workers Act (LAWA), finding that it drove undocumented workers toward informal employment or out of Arizona, but failed to benefit legal immigrants or native-born workers. Cybelle Fox, Irene Bloemraad, and Christel Kesler test immigrant explanations (disenfranchisement, perceived group threat, and diversity) for reduced state welfare provision, but find only that states with larger black (and to a lesser extent, larger Asian and Hispanic) populations have less redistribution. With rapidly shifting state and federal policies, the context within which immigrants and others experience poverty or social mobility, these authors investigate the origins of the current system and its ongoing emergence.</p><p>The final section is a single chapter in which Christian Dustmann and Tommaso Frattini critically detail the European experience with immigration and its differences from the U.S. experience in terms of history, source countries, migrant stocks, and education and labor market outcomes. It is useful in that much theory in this field has been framed from North America with overwhelming reference to its post-1965 shift in source countries. In standing alone this chapter begs for another European chapter or two on immigration and inequality, and is a reminder of the rarity of comparative work in this field (despite increasingly ever-present political contestation of immigration and austerity on both sides of the Atlantic).</p><p>Some of the chapters could be better edited so that intensive data analysis does not threaten to subsume key findings. But this is a minor quibble for, overall, the tables excellently demonstrate the numerous relationships that condition hypotheses and their testing in this enormous and seismic field. The second-generation accounts could come from somewhere else as well as Los Angeles (even Europe), but they serve to illustrate theoretical differences in expectations, as well as the very different experiences by origin group. This 469-page volume is already a massive contribution. Challenging model approaches and findings are detailed in footnotes for specialists or skeptics, but explained in more comprehensible language for a wider public in the text. The multidisciplinary array of researchers is carefully modest, often asserting the limitations of their own approach while detailing it so carefully as to encourage scrutiny, critical attention to questions, concepts, and data, and further research. The writing is often exceptional, and the significance of the issues both theoretical and political made clear. Immigration, Poverty, and Socioeconomic Inequality should be of interest to any researcher working in the area. It deserves careful reading from any of us evaluating these issues, whether at work or at the ballot box. Edited by Philip McCann, this book is part of the collection "International Library of Critical Writings in Economics" published by Edward Elgar. It contains a selection of research articles with the aim of highlighting the major features and breakthroughs of spatial economics and economic geography for the last two decades. Twenty-four papers, ranging from 1997 to 2011, are organized within four sections of six papers each. The sections are entitled: "Knowledge, Innovation and Geography," "Cities and Clustering," "Labour and Markets," and "Empirics." A short introduction by McCann sets the tone of the volume: its purpose is to provide a sense of all the developments of the field, with its "foundations and framework for understanding where the field is currently going, what the key questions and challenges being addressed are, and what the current consensus and disagreements are" (p. xii). However, with a field as broad as this, some choices had to be made as to the topics chosen for the sections of the volume with a focus on innovation (part 1), cities (part 2) and land markets (part 3), and methods (part 4).</p><p>The fundamental role played by geographical proximity in knowledge flows and innovation activities is investigated in the first part of the volume. Anselin, Varga, and Acs (chapter 1) provide evidence of the local geographical extent of spillovers between university research and high technology innovations, while Carlino, Chatterjee, and Hunt (chapter 3) show that patent intensity is positively related to the density of employment. However, as stated by Boschma in chapter 2, geographical proximity is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for learning but can strengthen the other dimensions of proximity. The factors behind innovative capacity are investigated in the following two chapters, with a comparative analysis between Europe and the United States undertaken by Crescenzi, Rodríguez-Pose, and Storper (chapter 4) and an assessment of the impact of variety by Frenken, Van Oort, and Verburg (chapter 5). Finally, in a somewhat disconnected paper, Shearmur and Polèse (chapter 6) focus on the factors explaining local employment growth. Because its focus is on agglomeration economies, this chapter would have been more appropriate in part 2.</p><p>The second part of the book deals with cities, systems of cities, and linkages between economic activities. In an important contribution, Duranton (chapter 7) proposes a general model that accounts for the rapid location changes of industries across cities and the stability and skewed nature of the city size distribution. Specific aspects are then considered. On the one hand, the nature of the worldwide urban hierarchy is investigated in Henderson and Wang (chapter 11) with an attention to the role of institutions. On the other hand, the determinants of the location of industries and firms can be envisaged through the lens of Marshallian externalities. By constructing pairwise agglomeration indices for United States manufacturing industries, <ref type="bibr">Ellison,</ref><ref type="bibr">Glaeser,</ref><ref type="bibr">and Kerr (chapter 8)</ref> show that all three of Marshall's theories of agglomeration are supported but that input-output linkages are particularly important. Industrial clusters stemming as a consequence from agglomeration externalities have attracted much attention as they have been seen as the basis for public intervention. The concept in itself is, however, ambiguous, as demonstrated by Gordon and McCann (chapter 9) and can be related to different models of processes (pure agglomeration, industrial complex, and social networks). Moreover, because of their specific properties, Storper and Venables (chapter 12) argue that face-to-face contacts should be considered as the most fundamental aspect of proximity. Hence, social interactions are facilitated in dense urban areas so that the resurgence of big cities is seen by Glaeser and Gootlieb (chapter 10) as resulting from an increased demand from these interactions.</p><p>Labor and land markets and their interactions are considered in the third part of the volume. This part is relatively heterogeneous with several topics. The issue of migration is investigated in three chapters. Faggian and McCann (chapter 13) focus on interregional migration behavior of British university graduates and the role played by the labor market characteristics in these migrations. Other factors of migration are examined: community satisfaction in Mellander, Florida, and Stolarick (chapter 15) and the weather in Rappaport (chapter 17). In these two cases, the link with the title of the third part is not obvious. Two other papers focus on housing prices. A theoretical model of the growth of housing prices, including the effects of zoning and amenities, is proposed by Glaeser, Gyourko, and Saks (chapter 14). The role played by regulation is considered by Quigley and Raphael (chapter 16), who compare housing prices between more or less regulated cities and estimate the price elasticity of housing supply in regulated and unregulated cities. Finally, Shapiro (chapter 18) looks at the relationship between human capital and employment growth.</p><p>The last part, "Empirics," consists of a disparate set of papers. It starts with a methodological literature review of applied spatial econometrics by Elhorst (chapter 19). Bel and Fageda (chapter 20) examine the determinants of the location of large firms' headquarters across European urban areas. Because of its topic, it could have been placed in the second part. Fingleton and Fisher (chapter 21) provide a range of estimations to test the comparative relevance of neoclassical theory and new economic geography to explain cross-regional variation in economic regional European development. The marginal benefits of public capital are estimated in Haughwout (chapter 22). A meta-analysis of urban agglomeration estimates is provided by Melo, Graham, and Noland (chapter 23). Finally, Rodrik, Subramanian, and Trebbi (chapter 24) estimate the respective contributions of institutions, geography, and trade. Unfortunately, there is no apparent logic in the organization of this part.</p><p>With the explosion of theoretical, analytical, and empirical papers dealing with the spatial organization of economic activities, the determinants of location choices and the role played by geography in economic development, any volume providing a state of the art of spatial economics and economic geography should be a welcome addition. However, precisely because the field is large and encompasses many different traditions, it cannot be exhaustive, as acknowledged by the editor. The choices of the topics (innovation, cities, land market, and methods) are relevant in their own right but not justified with respect to other issues that could have been tackled, such as the structure of cities, sociospatial segregation, agglomeration, and regional growth or local public economics. Moreover, while it provides a good mix between theoretical and empirical papers, the normative dimension of economic geography is relatively absent. Each part is more or less homogenous but the last part on methods comprises articles without a clear link between them. Rather than grouping disparate empirical contributions, it could have been interesting to provide here more methodological literature reviews in the spirit of Elhorst. Probably, a less ambitious title combined with some thematic narrowing would have been preferable. Despite these limitations, the book will be of interest for people wanting to have available a selection of quality research on various aspects of spatial economics and economic geography.</p></div>
