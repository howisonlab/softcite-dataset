			<abstract>
				<p>Background: Recent evidence has suggested that epithelial cancers including colorectal cancer (CRC) have driven by a small population of self-renewing, multi-potent cells termed cancer stem cells (CSCs) which could be responsible for recurrence of cancer. Aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1) activity has used as a functional stem cell biomarker to isolate CSCs in different cancers such as colorectal cancer. Objectives: The main aim of this research was to determine the utility of ALDH1 activity along with CD44 and EPCAM in identifying stem cell-like cells in human HT-29 colonic adenocarcinoma cell line. Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, colon CSCs biomarkers including CD44, EPCAM and ALDH1 in colonospheres and parent cells have analyzed by flow cytometry. The expression levels of stemness genes in spheroid and parental cells have investigated using SYBR Green real-time PCR. In addition, in vivo xenografts assay has performed to determine tumorigenic potential of tumor spheroid cells in nude mice. Results: According to results, over 92% of spheroids were CD44+/EpCAM+, while parent cells only have expressed 38% of CD44/EpCAM biomarkers (P &lt; 0.001). Controversially, ALDH activity was about 2-fold higher in the parent cells than spheroid cells (P &lt; 0.05). In comparison with the parental cells, expression levels of &apos;&apos;stemness&apos;&apos; genes, like Sox2, Oct4, Nanog, C-myc, and Klf4 have significantly increased in colonosphere cells (P &lt; 0.05). Further, administration of 2500 spheroids could be sufficient to initiate tumor growth in nude mice, while 1x106 of parental cells has needed to form tumor. Conclusions: For the first time, we have shown that colonospheres with low ALDH1 activity has indicated increased tumorigenic potential and stemness properties. So, it hasn&apos;t seemed that ALDH1 could become a useful biomarker to identify CSCs population in HT-29 cell line.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Generation and Characterization of Colonospheres</head><p>In this study, we have found that human HT-29 colonic adenocarcinoma cells could form spheroid colonies in a serum-free medium containing. To investigate the capability of colon spheres differentiation, these cells have cultivated in 10% FBS medium rather than EGF and FGF-2. In present serum, spherical undifferentiated cells have attached to the plate, and differentiated into adherent cells with epithelial cell morphology <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 1)</ref>. In serum free condition, the expression levels of EpCAM and CD44 were significantly higher in spheroid than parent cells (P &lt; 0.001) ( <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>). The results have demonstrated that 92.3 ± 3.6% of these tu-mor spheroid cells were CD44+/EpCAM+, while parent cells only have expressed 38.4 ± 1.6% of CD44+/EpCAM+ markers. We have measured ALDH1 activity in colonospheres and parent cells-derived colonic HT-29 cell line. Interestingly, we have found that HT29 cells have exhibited substantially high levels of ALDH activity in the parent fractions in compared with the spheroid fractions. ALDH activity was 16.9 ± 1.2 in spheroid cells in comparison with 34.6 ± 2.3 in parental cells (P &lt; 0.05) <ref type="figure">(Figure 3)</ref>. We have evaluated the frequency of sphere-forming cells by doing an extreme limiting dilution analysis (ELDA) for spheroid and parent-derived HT-29 cells. The results have indicated that the frequency of spheroid formation in cell line -derived colonospheres were 6.4 fold higher than -derived the parent cells (P &lt; 0.005) ( <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 2</ref>). The findings have suggested that colonospheres have formed by the colon cancer cell have enriched population of CSCs.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Colonospheres Can Generate Tumors Upon Xenotransplantation</head><p>To determine tumorigenicity in colonosphere and parental cells in vivo, nude mice have subcutaneously injected with either colonosphere or parent cells. The results have shown the ability of spheroid cells in tumor formation was significantly higher in comparison with parental cells ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5A</ref>). The data have shown that as few as 2500 spheroid cells were sufficient to induce tumor growth, whereas 1 × 10 6 of parental cells capable to form tumor <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">(Table 3)</ref>. Histological analyses have shown that tumors-induced of both xenografts have derived from spheroid and parental cells had the same character of original tumor ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5B</ref>).       </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Discussion</head><p>Previous studies have demonstrated that in addition to primary tumors, established cancer cell lines might be contained a subpopulation of cells possessing CSCs properties <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22)</ref>. In this research, we have identified and characterized CSCs in the colorectal cancer-derived cell line HT-29 through investigation of sphere formation and surface biomarkers. Studies have shown that under serum-free defined media, CSCs had ability to form floating spheroids <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(19)</ref>. In consistent with previous observation, we have shown that in serum-free conditions HT-29 cell line could form spheroid colonies (colonospheres) and following exposure to 10% FBS differentiate into large and adherent cells , maintaining self-renewal capacity and differentiation potential.</p><p>Moreover, ELDA has resulted for survey functional CSCs in colonospheres has revealed that colonospheres has marked increasing frequency of cells with sphere-forming ability. Thus, it has suggested under extreme limited dilution and in serum-free conditions, spheroids could only formed from stem-like cells. Consequently, the formation of colonospheres with a very small number of HT-29 cell line has demonstrated enrichment CSCs in colono-spheres <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20)</ref>.</p><p>Furthermore, we have shown that colonospheres have expressed the specifics markers including Sox2, Oct4, Nanog, C-myc and KLF4 which were important for stemness properties. In several studies have reported correlations between multi potent genes expression and stemness maintenance of human CSCs (8-10). Saigusa et al. has reported meaningful correlations among the expression level of OCT4, SOX2 and CD133 with distant recurrence, and poor prognosis of rectal cancer patients with preoperative chemo radiotherapy <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>. Consistent with these results, Saiki et al. has also shown that lin-28 and SOX2 expression has highly associated with lymph node metastasis and Dukes stage <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(10)</ref>.</p><p>Currently, several molecules have identified as markers for colon cancer stem cells such as CD133, CD44, CD166 and CD24 (2-6). Previous reports via flow cytometry analysis in tumor spheres and parent cells have shown associating between CD44 and EPCAM expression with colon CSCs. The results of present study has indicated significant expression of CD44 and EPCAM in colonospheres in comparison with parent cells so that colonospheres-de-rived cells were over 96% CD44+and EPCAM+. In line with these results, Kanwar et al. has shown that spheroid cells derived from HT-29 and HCT116 have higher expression of CD44 and EPCAM in comparison with parental cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(19)</ref>. Thus these data strongly has indicated that colonospheres have generated under present conditions have mainly composed of CSCs.</p><p>More recently, ALDH1 has proposed as a promising new biomarker in normal and malignant human colonic SCs. Chu et al. has revealed that in vivo implantation of CD-44hi ALDH+ colon tumor cells were significantly more tumorigenic than matched CD44hi ALDH-cells. Therefore, as few as 100 CD44hi ALDH+ cells could lead to tumor formation <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>. In addition, Huang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(16)</ref> has shown that implantation of only 25 ALDH+ cancer cells have tumorigenicity in NOD/SCID mice. However, further isolation of cancer cells ALDH+ using CD44 or CD133 only modestly has resulted in tumor-initiating ability <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(11)</ref>. Thus, we have suggested that ALDH1 activity could be a valuable biomarker for identifying CSC in colonosphere population. Controversy, our findings have revealed that colonospheres exhibit have decreased levels of ALDH1 activity in comparison with the corresponding parental cells. Nevertheless, low ALDH1 activity in colonospheres had no effect on their tumorigenic potential, so this population even has shown higher ability for initiating tumor, in comparison with parental cell with high ALDH1 activity in in vivo situation. Our results have shown that administration of 2500 colonospheres could be sufficient to initiate tumor growth in nude mice while 1 × 10 6 of parental cells has needed to form tumor. It would be important to point out that results of primary tumor could not generalized to colonic cell line like HT-29. The present data has indicated that there was no correlation between ALDH activity and the tumorigenic capacity, and it could not be as a universal biomarker for identifying CSCs.</p><p>Expression of ALDH1 could be different in population of tumor cell lines indicating CSCs properties. For instance, recently Yuval Shaked et al. has demonstrated that spheroid of U-87MG, MCF7, and PANC1cell lines rather than their types of parental have increased levels of ALDH1 activity. It has also shown that ALDH activity in A549 and HT-29 cells was substantially high levels in the parental in comparison with the spheroid. However, higher expression of p21 and p53 has found in spheroid of HT-29, showing more angiogenic effects and resistant to chemotherapy than parent cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(23)</ref>. A similar result has also reported by Yu et al. who have shown that high level expression of ALDH or the present of CD44 in CSCs of prostate cancer cell lines could not be relevant with tumorigenicity capacity, so that ALDHlo CD44-cells and ALDHhiCD44+cells has exhibited the same proliferative, clonogenic and metastatic capacity, indicating their potential importance for further exploration <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(24)</ref>.</p><p>Moreover, ALDH-melanoma cells could be equally resistant to treatment and tumorigenic with ALDH+ which indicates the functional ''marker'' ALDH has not played an exclusive role in tumor initiation and/or in low response to therapy <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(25)</ref>.</p><p>For the first time, our current experimental data have shown that ALDH activity has not appeared to specifically identify CSCs in HT-29 cell line. It could suggested that isolation of CSC-derived HT-29 cell line base on CD44 and EPCAM markers might be useful for characterization and further investigation of this cell line.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Table 1 . 4 F</head><label>14</label><figDesc>The Primer Sequences and PCR Conditions : 5'-CCCAATTACCCATCCTTCC-3' 60ºC 303 bp R: 5'-GTGCCTGGTCAGTTCATC-3' HGPRT F: 5'-CCTGGCGTCGTGATTATGG-3' 60ºC 125 bp R: 5'-TCAGTCCTGTCCATAATTAGTCC-3'</figDesc></figure>
