			<abstract>
				<p>Radioimmunotherapy using a radiolabeled monoclonal antibody that targets tumor cells has been shown to be efficient for the treatment of many malignant cancers, with reduced side effects. However, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) inhibits the transport of intravenous antibodies to tumors in the brain. Recent studies have demonstrated that focused ultrasound (FUS) combined with microbubbles (MBs) is a promising method to transiently disrupt the BBB for the drug delivery to the central nervous system. To find the optimal FUS and MBs that can induce reversible increase in the BBB permeability, we employed minimally invasive multiphoton microscopy to quantify the BBB permeability to dextran-155 kDa with similar molecular weight to an antibody by applying different doses of FUS in the presence of MBs with an optimal size and concentration. The cerebral microcirculation was observed through a section of frontoparietal bone thinned with a micro-grinder. About 5 minutes after applying the FUS on the thinned skull in the presence of MBs for 1 minute, TRITC (tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate)-dextran-155 kDa in 1% bovine serum albumin in mammalian Ringer&apos;s solution was injected into the cerebral circulation via the ipsilateral carotid artery by a syringe pump. Simultaneously, the temporal images were collected from the brain parenchyma ~100-200 μm below the pia mater. Permeability was determined from the rate of tissue solute accumulation around individual microvessels. After several trials, we found the optimal dose of FUS. At the optimal dose, permeability increased by ~14-fold after 5 minutes post-FUS, and permeability returned to the control level after 25 minutes. FUS without MBs or MBs injected without FUS did not change the permeability. Our method provides an accurate in vivo assessment for the transient BBB permeability change under the treatment of FUS. The optimal FUS dose found for the reversible BBB permeability increase without BBB disruption is reliable and can be applied to future clinical trials.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Macromolecules such as monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have attracted attention because of their potential clinical benefits. More recently, mAbs conjugated with radioisotopes, or radioimmunotherapy, administered into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), have proven safe in Phase I clinical trials for the treatment of leptomeningeal cancers (one type of brain cancer), and the patients survived for extended periods of time. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> While these studies have been shown to extend life, the methods are less than ideal because of their invasiveness and slow rate of diffusion from the CSF into the parenchyma.</p><p>Access to the brain parenchyma is characteristically limited to cells lying close to the ventricles or infusion sites due to small diffusion distances of drugs and drug carriers through the interstitial space. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> The surface area of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is 5,000 times that of the blood-CSF barrier, and therefore the BBB is considered to be the primary barrier controlling the uptake of drugs into the brain parenchyma. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> Thus, a more ideal route of administration would be through the systemic blood stream if obstacles related to BBB penetration of these macromolecules could be circumvented.</p><p>Among the numerous strategies to deliver therapeutic drugs into the central nervous system, the focused ultrasound (FUS) sonication combined with microbubbles (MBs) has been shown to be effective in transiently disrupting the BBB for noninvasive drug delivery. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> At appropriate acoustic power density (or pressure), burst repetition rate (BRR), duty cycle, sonication duration, and in the presence of MBs with proper materials, sizes, and concentrations, FUS can achieve noninvasive, selective, and localized disruption of the BBB without visible damage to the brain tissue. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> FUS-induced BBB disruption has been widely assessed by using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or post-FUS histological examination. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> Indirect MRI collects the images of brain slices in the presence of an MRI contrast agent such as gadolinium to access the BBB disruption in different locations of the brain. Alternatively, post-FUS histological examination relates the BBB disruption to the amount of Evans blue extravasation in the brain tissue after the dye is intravenously injected into the blood circulation before or after sonication. However, the sub-millimeter spatial resolution of the MRI studies and the postmortem histological examinations only assess the relatively large leakage of the BBB, and these methods are restricted to the exploration of a region that is much larger than a single microvessel with its surrounding tissue. Therefore, the BBB disruption assessed by the MRI and histological examination is more qualitative than quantitative. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> To overcome aforementioned limitations, two-photon microscopy can be employed to quantitatively access the enhanced permeability of the cerebral vasculature after FUS. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> In addition to micrometer spatial resolution, two-photon microscopy offers the advantage of deep tissue penetration, which is essential for the BBB permeability measurement. However, in the studies from Nhan et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> the MBs for enhancing the FUS effect and the fluorescently labeled test solutes were injected via the animal tail vein. This administration route leads to the uneven distribution of MBs and uncertainty in the MB concentration in both the FUS-stimulated region and in the test solute concentration in cerebral microvessels, resulting in inaccurate assessments of the dynamics of FUSenhanced BBB permeability. In addition, their study only estimated the permeability index in a region of ~500 μm ×500 μm containing many types of blood vessels, not the true BBB permeability at the individual microvessel level.</p><p>The objective of the current study was to use our newly developed multiphoton microscopy <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> to more accurately assess the FUS-induced BBB permeability change in vivo. To accomplish this aim, MBs were generated and selected for the optimal size in inducing reversible BBB disruptions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> Subsequently, the MBs were injected via the carotid artery at a constant rate to achieve a constant concentration in the cerebral microvessels in the region of sonication, where the "optimal" concentration was based on previous studies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> After FUS in the presence of MBs, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate (TRITC)-dextran-155 kDa, a model mAbs macromolecule, was injected via the carotid artery, and the BBB permeability was determined for an individual microvessel by a method described by Yuan et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> Our current study enabled us to find optimal FUS and MBs that can induce reversible increase in the BBB permeability to macromolecules. These findings will contribute to designing efficient and safe delivery strategies for the brain drug delivery, particularly for the delivery of antibodies.</p></div>

Stabilizing agent polyoxyethylene 40 stearate (PEG40S; Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) was dissolved in filtered deionized water (18 MΩ, Direct-Q; EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). All solutions were prepared using 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in Ringer's solution (pH 7.4-7.45) (see below for the composition), and glassware was previously cleaned with reagent alcohol (90:5:5 vol% of ethanol/methanol/isopropanol; Sigma-Aldrich). <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> MBs were prepared as previously described. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> MBs having too large sizes may induce harmful effects such as blocking the blood flow in the pulmonary microvessels, while those having too small sizes may have no effects on enhancing the BBB permeability. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> In order to narrow down the size distribution of the MBs to near the optimal size of around 2 μm in diameter, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> size isolation was performed by centrifugation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> Briefly, MB solution was placed into a centrifuge (5702R; Eppendorf North America, Hauppauge, NY, USA) for 1 minute at 100 RCF (relative centrifugal force) to remove bubbles larger than ~4 μm. The infranatant was collected and centrifuged for another 1 minute at 200 RCF to remove bubbles greater than ~3 μm in diameter. Then, the infranatant was collected again and centrifuged for 7 minutes at 300 RCF to concentrate all bubbles with a diameter around ~2 μm. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> The last step was repeated three times to ensure the complete removal of the remaining aggregates that did not form MBs.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>animal preparation</head><p>In vivo experiments were conducted on adult female Sprague Dawley rats (250-300 g, age 3-4 months; Hilltop Laboratory Animals Inc., Scottsdale, PA, USA). All procedures and the animal use were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the City College of New York. Rats were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium injected subcutaneously (initial dosage 65 mg/kg bodyweight). A heating pad was used to keep the rat at its body temperature. The depth of anesthesia was monitored for the absence of withdrawal reflex to toe pinch and absence of blink reflex. Anesthesia was further checked every 15 minutes during the experiment; an additional 3 mg/dose pentobarbital was given when needed. At the end of the experiments, an overdose of pentobarbital (100 mg/kg) was administered intravenously to euthanize the animal.</p><p>The preparation of the rat skull observation area was the same as that previously described. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> Briefly, the skull in the region of interest (ROI) was exposed by shaving off the hair and cutting away the skin and connective tissue. A section of the frontoparietal bone (either left or right) was carefully ground with a high speed micro-grinder (0-50,000 rpm, DLT 50KBU; Brasseler USA, Savannah, GA, USA) until a part of it (~4 mm ×6 mm) became soft and translucent. During the process, artificial CSF (ACSF) at room temperature was applied to the surface of the skull to dispel the heat due to grinding. After grinding, the left or the right carotid artery was cannulated with PE50 tubing. The rat was then placed on a stereotaxic alignment system (SAS 597; David Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA, USA), and its head was fixed with two ear bars and a mouth clamp. After FUS treatment, the cerebral microvessels were observed under the objective lens of a multiphoton microscope through the thinned part of the skull and the BBB permeability was determined. The pH was buffered to 7.40-7.45 by adjusting the ratio of HEPES acid to base. In addition, both the washout solution and the fluorescent dye solution contained 10 mg/mL BSA (A4378; Sigma-Aldrich). <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> The solutions were made fresh on the day of use to avoid binding to the serum albumin.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ultrasound equipment and calibration</head><p>A spherical 1-MHz FUS transducer (Ws50-P50; Ultran, State College, PA, USA) with a focal length of 50 mm and a focal area diameter of 3 mm was used in this study. The power was generated by a function generator (AFG3251; Tektronix Inc., Beaverton, OR, USA). An ultrasound power meter (UPM-DI-1AV; Ohmic Instruments, Easton, MD, USA) was used to measure the acoustic pressure generated by the ultrasound transducer in a degaussed water bath at room temperature. The acoustic pressure measured was automatically converted into power by the power meter system. To determine the relationship of ultrasound power as a function of BRR (in kilohertz) and peak-to-peak voltage (in volts), powers were measured at varying BRRs (200-1,000 kHz) and voltages (1-5 V). The duty cycle was kept constant at 5% for tested pulses from 200 to 1,000 kHz. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref> demonstrates the calibration results of the acoustic power density (power per unit focus area) versus voltage and BRR for the devices used in the current study. Dots are measured data, and the surface is the best fitting. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3A</ref> illustrates the setup of ultrasound sonication. The ultrasound probe was placed in a custom-made clear acrylic adapter and was attached to a stereotaxic alignment system. The adapter allowed placement of the ultrasound probe in one end and a rubber-latex sheet (300-series, North; McMaster Carr, Robbinsville, NJ, USA) in the other. The reservoir water was degassed with a vacuum pressure pump (Air Cadet 420-1901; Thermo Fisher Scientific) at room temperature (25°C). By implementing the stereotaxic alignment system, the focal area of the ultrasound probe was easily and accurately located over the rat's head by softly pressuring the latex-sheet water reservoir over the thinned skull. Formation of air bubbles or air layers between the rat's skull and the rubber-latex sheet was avoided by applying an ultrasound transmission gel (National Medical Alliance, Carmel, IN, USA). After the rat was placed on the stereotaxic instrument and its head was fixed, the FUS sonication was applied to the brain through the thinned skull, while the MBs were injected simultaneously into the carotid artery at a constant flow rate ~3 mL/min by a syringe pump. We applied ultrasound at several acoustic powers (in a range of ~2.85-15.00 W/cm 2 ) with different BRRs and voltages ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref>) to find the proper FUS dose for a reversible increase of the BBB permeability in the presence of our MBs.</p></div>

Simultaneously, the images of the ROI containing the microvessels and the surrounding brain tissue were captured for 1 minute at 5-minute intervals up to 25 minutes. The images of 239 μm ×239 μm (512×512) were collected at a rate of ~1 second per image. The corresponding resolution is 0.467 μm ×0.467 μm.</p><p>The collected images were then transferred to an image acquisition and analysis workstation to determine the BBB solute permeability.</p><p>experimental protocol <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3C</ref> summarizes the experimental protocol for FUS effects on the BBB solute permeability. The MBs at a concentration of ~1.7×10 6 bubbles/mL were injected via rat carotid artery at a constant speed of ~3 mL/min, the normal blood flow velocity at the carotid artery; after 10-15 seconds, the MBs reach the microvascular bed ~100-200 μm below the pia mater, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> and the FUS sonication was administrated for 1 minute. After sonication, the rat head was mounted into the multiphoton microscope, and the ROI with cerebral microvessels was found. This took about 5 minutes. Then, the images for determining the BBB solute permeability were collected for 1 minute at a rate of one image per second in a 5-minute interval, up to 25 minutes. For comparison, three control experiments were performed: 1) measurement of permeability in the presence of 1% BSA in Ringer's solution only, no MBs and FUS; 2) same protocol, with only MBs; 3) same protocol, with only FUS. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Determination of the BBB solute permeability</head><p>We used the similar method as in our previous study for permeability of pial microvessels <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> to determine permeability of cerebral microvessels ~100-200 μm below the pia mater. Most of the microvessels chosen were post-capillary venules of 15-40 μm diameter for the permeability measurement, and around 1/4 of the microvessels were capillaries. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> The reasons that we currently only measured the permeability of post-capillary venules and capillaries were: 1) to avoid the influence of smooth muscle cells at arteries, arterioles, and large venules, which would contract under stimuli and affect the permeability measurement; <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> 2) our previous studies on the BBB permeability were also conducted on this type of post-capillary venules. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> The permeability was determined off-line from the pre-collected images by using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4A</ref> shows a typical image of an ROI (~239 μm ×239 μm) with a couple of microvessels and surrounding brain tissue. The total fluorescence intensity in a rectangular window including a vessel lumen and the surrounding tissue ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4A</ref>) was measured by ImageJ. The measuring window was ~50-100 μm long and ~30-60 μm wide and was set at least 10 μm from the base of the bifurcation to avoid solute contamination from the side arms. The criteria for the size and placement of the measuring window were 1) the vessel segment is straight, 2) the dye does not spread out of the window during the time for permeability measurement (10-60 seconds), and 3) no dye contamination from the neighboring vessels into the window.

Subsequently, we adjusted the voltage and BRR while keeping the duty cycle constant at 5% to generate different acoustic powers. <ref type="figure">Figure 5A</ref> shows a disrupted BBB after ~5 minutes by applying a power of ~13.1 W/cm 2 (voltage =4 V and BRR =500 kHz) for 1 minute. We then reduced the power to ~6.3 W/cm 2 (voltage =2.5 V and BRR =500 kHz). <ref type="figure">Figure 5B</ref> shows the image of the cerebral microvessels taken after ~20 minutes by applying 1-minute sonication at this dose. Although there was no visible BBB disruption, the increased permeability was not reversible in ~60 minutes (the measurement was stopped after 60 minutes). The corresponding BBB permeability measured after 5, 10, 30, and 60 minutes was found to be 27.1×10 -7 , 23.5×10 -7 , 23.6×10 <ref type="bibr">-7</ref> , and 19.6×10 -7 cm/s, respectively. These values are more than ten-fold greater than the control values without FUS treatment <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">(Table 1)</ref>. Reducing the power to 3.4 W/cm 2 by decreasing the voltage to 1.25 V, there was no change in the BBB permeability for 60 minutes. However, keeping the same power of ~6.3 W/cm 2 , but reducing the voltage to 1.25 V and increasing the BRR to 1,000 kHz, we were able to achieve a reversible BBB permeability increase in ~30 minutes. <ref type="figure">Figure 5C</ref> shows the image of the cerebral microvessels after ~20 minutes by applying this reversible acoustic dose for 1 minute. For comparison, <ref type="figure">Figure 5D</ref> shows the image of microvessels under the control condition without FUS and MBs. The fluorescence intensity in the surrounding tissue of the microvessels was noticeably higher in Figures 5B and C than that in <ref type="figure">Figure 5D</ref>, indicating more tracers passing across the microvessel due to the FUS-induced permeability increase in the presence of MBs.   <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6±0.</ref>3)×10 -7 , (1.8±0.5)×10 <ref type="bibr">-7</ref> , and (1.7±0.3)×10 -7 cm/s, respectively. The permeability of that under only MB injection without sonication (bubble only, n=6) at 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 minutes was (1.4±0.4)×10 -7 , (1.1±0.3)×10 -7 , (1.2±0.1)×10 -7 , (1.3±0.9)×10 -7 , and (1.4±0.5)×10 -7 cm/s, respectively. The permeability of that under FUS in the absence of MBs ("ultrasound only", n=6) at 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 minutes was (1.5±0.3)×10 -7 , (1.6±0.4)×10 -7 , (1.3±0.2)×10 -7 , (1.1±0.1)×10 <ref type="bibr">-7</ref> , and (1.2±0.2)×10 -7 cm/s, respectively. They have no significant differences compared with the control group (P0.6). <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 1</ref> summarizes the measured permeability and its corrected value for the RBCs, free dye, and solvent drag under various conditions at specific times. Since the ratio of the diffusive permeability, P d , to the apparent permeability corrected after RBC and free dye was more than 97.5%, the solvent drag contribution to the BBB permeability to TRITC-dextran-155 kDa was negligible. In contrast, the solvent drag contribution to the macromolecule permeability is significant in rat mesenteric microvessels due to two orders of magnitude higher hydraulic conductivity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref>  <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table  1</ref> also summarizes the mean radius of the microvessels for each group. Since there was no significant difference in the BBB permeability between the post-capillary venules and the capillaries (P0.09), we only gave a mean size for these two types of microvessels.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Nhan et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> used two-photon microscopy to investigate the reversible and localized BBB disruption induced by FUS in the presence of MBs by imaging the cerebral vasculature during BBB disruption and observing the extravasation of fluorescently labeled solutes in real-time in vivo. They found that the threshold acoustic pressure for a successful induction in BBB disruption was 0.4-0.6 MPa by combining the MBs with a similar size and a reduced concentration as those used in the current study. Under this dose of FUS and the MBs, they observed a visible BBB disruption in the cerebral microvasculature, which peaked around 5 minutes, especially for microvessels with diameter of 10-30 μm. By using a formula in Dreher et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42</ref> they converted the extravasation rate of the fluorescently labeled solutes to a global permeability index for the entire microvasculature, which peaked around 5 minutes and returned to the baseline in 20 minutes for test solutes, dextran-10k and -70k, in their study. Their estimated FUSinduced microvasculature permeability index changing patterns are similar to those in the individual microvessels under the current study. However, we found that under 0.43 MPa (13.1 W/cm 2 ) of our FUS, the wall of the individual microvessel was disrupted and could not go back to its baseline ( <ref type="figure">Figure 5A</ref>). Even at a reduced power of 0.3 MPa (6.3 W/cm 2 ) with a voltage of 2.5 V, the permeability of the individual microvessel could not go back to its baseline value in ~60 minutes ( <ref type="figure">Figure 5B</ref>). The study from Nhan et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> was invaluable in narrowing parameter space and defining a consistent methodology. However, the method in Nhan et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> had some limitations. First, being injected via the tail vein, MBs would go back to the right ventricle of the heart, through the pulmonary circulation before they go into the systemic circulation and reach the cerebral microvessels. Along this journey, the MBs would be trapped in the pulmonary microvessels with smaller diameters, be diluted, and result in an uncertain concentration in brain microvessels. This would induce inaccurate assessment of proper parameters for the FUS which can induce transient BBB permeability increase. Second, the equation they used to determine the microvasculature permeability assumes a constant driving force that is represented by the fluorescent intensity difference between the intravascular and extravascular spaces along the microvessel. However, tail vein injection of the fluorescently labeled solutes might not achieve a constant driving force along the microvessel due to the plasma clearance. Third, because of the poor drainage in the brain tissue, the built-up extravascular tracers could not be cleared out in time and may induce a saturated extravascular concentration or an extravascular concentration which is higher than the intravascular one, resulting in an inaccurate assessment of microvascular permeability by using the formula in Dreher et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42</ref> Fourth, the region of ~500 μm ×500 μm from where they determined the permeability, contains many types of microvessels including arterioles and venules. Postcapillary venules and capillaries were suggested to be more suitable for permeability study since they are relatively less contractible or expandable under stimulations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> These properties are necessary for accurate determination of the BBB permeability under FUS stimulations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> Finally, their method can only give a relative permeability index, not the true solute permeability for a microvessel defined by the Kedem-Katchalsky equation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42</ref> To overcome the aforementioned limitations, in our work we used multiphoton microscopy with a higher spatial resolution to accurately determine the BBB permeability for the individual post-capillary venule or capillary under the FUS treatment. By injecting both MBs and fluorescently labeled test solutes through the carotid artery, we can achieve a more constant concentration in the cerebral microvessels.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that the ultrasound power (voltage, BRR, and duty cycle), sonication duration, and MB size and concentration are important factors in controlling the BBB-disruption levels and determining whether or not the increased BBB permeability is reversible. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> Using MRI, the acoustic power threshold of opening the BBB was found to be 0.15-0.3 MPa. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43</ref> Whereas, the power threshold using two-photon microscopy was found to be 0.4-0.6 MPa. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> Using the same MB size and concentrations, we found that the FUS with the same power (0.3 MPa or 6.3 W/cm 2 ) at the reduced voltage and increased BRR induced a reversible BBB permeability increase compared with that with higher voltage and lower BRR, which did not exhibit reversibility. The mechanism responsible for this is unknown. Under this range of the FUS power, the thermal effect is negligible. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44</ref> Other possible mechanisms for increasing the BBB permeability by FUS-driven MB activities in the cerebral microvessels include stable cavitation (stable small oscillation) and inertial cavitation (large amplitude oscillation). <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46</ref> These activities can generate calcium transient, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47</ref> which may be responsible for the transient increase in the BBB permeability. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48</ref> The increased Ca 2+ concentration in brain microvascular endothelial cells by FUS-driven MBs <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> is similar to that induced by bradykinin, histamine, and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which are known to transiently increase the BBB permeability. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50</ref> The increased magnitude and the temporal pattern in the permeability of an individual cerebral microvessel induced by the optimized FUS and MBs in the current study are similar to those in the permeability of an individual mesenteric microvessel induced by ATP in a study by He and Curry, <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51</ref> which also demonstrated the same pattern in endothelial Ca 2+ concentration changes. This similarity suggests the mechanism of calcium transient by the FUS-driven MB activities in our study. Further investigation needs to be done to confirm this mechanism.</p><p>In summary, in order to find the optimal FUS and MBs that can induce reversible increase in the BBB permeability for the purpose of brain drug delivery, we employed minimally invasive multiphoton microscopy to quantify the BBB permeability to dextran-155 kDa with similar molecular weight to an antibody. We applyed different doses of FUS in the presence of MBs with an "optimal" size and concentration. After several trials, we found the optimal dose of FUS that can transiently increase the BBB permeability. Our analysis was the first study at the individual microvessel level which provides an accurate in vivo assessment for the transient BBB permeability change under the treatment of FUS/MBs. The optimal FUS dose found for the reversible BBB permeability increase without BBB disruption is reliable and can be applied to future clinical trials in radioimmunotherapy. Our method can also be used to assess the optimal parameters of FUS/MBs to deliver other types of therapeutic agents and drug carriers.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Mammalian ringer's solutionMammalian Ringer's solution was used for all perfusates, which was composed of (in mM) NaCl 132, KCl 4.6, MgSO 4 1.2, CaCl 2 2.0, NaHCO 3 5.0, glucose 5.5, and HEPES (2-[4-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazin-1-yl]ethanesulfonic acid) 20.</figDesc></figure>
