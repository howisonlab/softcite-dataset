#Codes apply to the article or a selection from the article. A selection may be an in text mention or a reference. Many codes below apply to both in text mentions and references, but may be used slightly differently because those contexts are slightly different. If you're currently coding an in text mention do not refer to the citations to gather more information and vice versa.

#You will read the article, highlight in text mentions (a selection) and their corresponding references, if present (another selection). Those selections will then be coded using the options below.
