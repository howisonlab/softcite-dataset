Modifying the procedure for the generation of x in this way does not alter the final distribution and thus both approaches provide random numbers that can be used to obtain a histogram following the expected shape given by the convolution of the two normal distributions. However, the latter approach introduces correlations between different x values, which is visible in Fig. 1 as these correlations lead to an underestimate of the uncertainties when the values of x are filled into a histogram using uncertainties equal to \u221a N where N is the number of entries in the bin of the nominal distribution. One possibility to quantify the correlation between different entries in a sequence of random numbers is given by the autocorrelation of the random number x:",
