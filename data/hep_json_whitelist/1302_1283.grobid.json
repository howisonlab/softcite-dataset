A good agreement between the data and the MC simulation for the E miss T distributions is found in these two Z control regions, both in events with low pileup and in events with high pileup.

By requiring the E miss T direction to be close to the jet direction, the selected events in the control region are dominated by \u00fe jets background. The yield of \u00fe jets obtained in control regions is then scaled by an extrapolation factor to predict the \u00fe jets background yield in the signal region, where the extrapolation factor is taken from a \u00fe jets MC sample. By varying the E miss T threshold from 60 to 100 GeVand varying the jet multiplicity requirement for the events from N jet !0 to N jet ! 1, alternative control samples are obtained to evaluate the systematic uncertainties. The main systematic uncertainty in the \u00fe jets estimate comes from the different background yields in different control regions. The systematic uncertainty on the extrapolation factor is obtained by comparing the predictions from SHERPA and PYTHIA \u00fe jets MC samples and varying the energy scale and resolution for jets and E miss T in MC samples.
