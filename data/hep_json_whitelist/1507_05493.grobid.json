A minimum requirement on the transverse mass M l;E miss T T of the lepton-E miss T system is similarly found to be effective in rejecting backgrounds from W boson and semileptonic tt decay for the photon \u00fe l analysis. A further requirement that the electron-photon system invariant mass not be close to the Z boson mass helps to reject Z boson backgrounds to the photon \u00fe l analysis. A requirement that SR \u03b3b L signal events have no identified charged leptons helps to reduce the background from semileptonic tt events, while a requirement that SR \u03b3j H signal events have R 4 T < 0.85 helps reduce the background from SM events, which tend to have fewer and softer jets than do signal events; as an illustration, see Fig. 4 (right). Finally, a requirement that the total transverse energy from jets with p T > 40 GeV (H jets T ) be less than 100 GeV helps reduce the backgrounds to SR \u03b3l e=\u03bc due to top quark production.

Exclusion limits imposed by the photon \u00fe j analysis in the two-dimensional plane of the GGM parameters M 3 and \u03bc, for the higgsino-bino GGM model with \u03bc > 0, using the merged (see text) SR \u03b3j L and SR \u03b3j H analyses. The observed limits are shown for the nominal SUSY model crosssection expectation, as well as for a SUSY cross section increased and decreased by 1 standard deviation of the cross-section systematic uncertainty. The expected limit is also shown, along with its AE1 standard-deviation range. Values of M 3 below 1100 GeV are excluded for most values of the \u03bc parameter, although a significant region corresponding to the case for which the gluino mass is close to that of the lightest neutralino masses remains unexcluded due to the requirements of one or more jets arising from the gluino decay.
