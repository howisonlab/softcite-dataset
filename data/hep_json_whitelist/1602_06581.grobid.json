Since the efficiencies are parametrized in terms of kinematic and topological quantities, the method is insensitive to the specific mix of processes, i.e., it does not require the relative fractions of tt, single top, and W + jets events in the CRs to be the same as in the search regions (nonetheless, these fractions agree to within less than 1% in simulation). A correction derived from data is applied to the weights to account for the trigger efficiency, while corrections from simulation account for contamination due to nonprompt electrons, contamination due to dilepton events in which one of the leptons is lost, and the selection efficiency of the m T requirement. Corresponding efficiencies are evaluated for dileptonic events in which both leptons are lost. This latter source of background is predicted to account for <2% of the total lost-lepton background. Finally, a correction is applied to account for the selection efficiency of the isolated-track veto.",
