For the latter, the jet cross sections were normalized to the inclusive DIS cross section, which significantly reduces the experimental and theoretical errors. Figure 1 shows the dijet cross section as a function of\u03b7 jet in \u03b3 p and inclusive-jet cross sections as a function of E jet T and P T in DIS. The data are very precise, the dominant experimental error being the energy scale of the jets in the ZEUS measurements and the model dependence of the data correction in the H1 measurement. The measurements are compared to next-to-leading (NLO) QCD predictions which describe the data very well. The theoretical errors are dominated by the renormalization scale uncertainty. The dijet cross sections have the potential of constraining further the proton and photon PDFs and the inclusive-jet cross sections provide direct sensitivity to \u03b1 s (M Z ). ",
