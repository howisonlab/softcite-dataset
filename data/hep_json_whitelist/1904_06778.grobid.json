Ensembling: Because the solution of the clustering of the previous step depends on the random walk in the doublet space, and the smearing on bin assignment, multiple passes of clustering are run and ensembled to produce a better solution. Each track index (or index of a bin in the five dimensions) determines a set of hits from which a set of track candidate features are extracted and then use to train a boosted decision tree for binary classification of the candidate. The multiple solutions of clustering are merged recursively in pairs, by selecting for each hit, the track with the best classification score.3. Post-Processing:Further merging of candidates that are close in the helix parameter space is done by first estimating the curvature and longitudinal impact parameter that minimize the standard deviation of the remaining three helix parameters. The triplet of parameters are then recomputed and used to find hits with close-by helix parameters.",
