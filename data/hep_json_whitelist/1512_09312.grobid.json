We note that Q 2 -dependent correlated errors we considered as part of the error treatment, such as that in the electromagnetic energy scale, can cause trends in the data similar to the difference between the prediction and observed shape in Q 2 in fig. 4(c) and the apparent upward slope in fig. 5. When these correlated errors are taken into account, both the aboslutely normalized version shown here and the shape of the data distribution are consistent with the GENIE predictions within 1\u03c3; this is reflected in the \u03c7 2 values reported in the figures.
