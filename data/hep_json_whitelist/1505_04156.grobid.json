Suggested values for \u2206m 2 es are about 1 eV 2 and sin 2 (2\u03b8 es ) = 0.1 [1]. So the approximation is good for short baseline experiments. The small value of sin 2 (2\u03b8 es ) suggests that high statistics are needed to see the effect and that systematic errors may dominate the measurement. Values as high as \u2206m 2 es > 5 eV 2 can be fit [1]. The interaction of MeV scale antineutrinos (such as from fission products) on hydrogen,\u03bd e + P \u2192 e + + N is a well understood process that lends itself to the background resistant delayed coincidence method where the neutron is measured after the initial neutrino interaction occurs to produce a positron. Almost all of the neutrino energy is carried by the positron so neutrino energy ambiguity is determined by detector resolution and not neutrino reaction kinematics.",
