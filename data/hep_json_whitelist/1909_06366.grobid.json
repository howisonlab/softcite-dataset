It seems plausible to assume that the flavorless exchange in elastic scattering is dominated by gluon ladders, in contrast to ordinary Regge trajectories, which include the exchange of valence quarks. This might also explain why the Pomeron trajectory has a different slope compared to all other meson Regge trajectories (see Fig. 5). According to Eq. (21), a different slope also corresponds to a different string tension for the Pomeron. Glueballs are discussed as good candidates for physical particle states on the Pomeron trajectory.",
