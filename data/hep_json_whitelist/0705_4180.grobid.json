The second subscript S denotes the spectrometer magnet polarities (opposite for the events in the numerator and in the denominator of each ratio) deflecting the kaon to negative x (towards the Sal\u00e8ve mountain, given the topographical situation of the experiment in relation to the mountains surrounding CERN) and J corresponds to the deflection of the pions in the opposite direction (towards the Jura mountain chain). The spectra N + (u) and N \u2212 (u) for each of the four individual ratios in (5) are obtained from successive runs taken with the same beam magnet polarities and with the \u03c0 \u00b1 deflected in the same direction by the spectrometer magnet. The parameter \u2206g and the normalization R are extracted from a fit to the measured quadruple ratio R 4 (u) using the function in eq. 5b . The measured slope difference \u2206g is insensitive to the normalization parameter R, which reflects the ratio of K + and K \u2212 fluxes.",
