In order to evaluate possible differences between the measured JSF (from light quarks with gluon contamination) and the b jet energy scale, the flavor uncertainties for jets from light quarks, gluons, and bottom quarks are evaluated separately and added linearly. b jet modeling: This term has three components: The fragmentation into b hadrons is varied in simulation within the uncertainties of the Bowler-Lund fragmentation function tuned to ALEPH [58] and DELPHI [59] data. In addition, the difference between the Bowler-Lund [60] and the Peter-son [61] fragmentation functions is included in the uncertainty. Lastly, the uncertainty from the semileptonic b hadron branching fraction is obtained by varying it by \u2212 0.45% and + 0.77%, which is the range of the measurements from B 0 /B + decays and their uncertainties [3].",
