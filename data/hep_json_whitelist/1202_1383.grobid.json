A J=c suppression was also observed at RHIC, in central Au-Au collisions [4,5], at a level similar to the one observed at the SPS when measured at midrapidity although it is larger at forward rapidity. Several models [6][7][8][9] attempt to reproduce the RHIC data by adding to the direct J=c production a regeneration component from deconfined charm quarks in the medium, which counteracts the J=c dissociation in a QGP. A quantitative description of these final-state effects is however difficult at the present time because of the lack of precision in the CNM effects and in the open charm cross section determination. The measurement of charmonium production is especially promising at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) where the high energy density of the medium and the large number of c \" c pairs produced in central Pb-Pb collisions should help to disentangle between the different suppression and regeneration scenarios.
