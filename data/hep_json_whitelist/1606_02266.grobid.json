The contribution from the gg \u2192 ZH production process, calculated only at NLO in QCD and indicated separately in brackets, is given with a theoretical uncertainty assumed to be 30%. The uncertainties in the cross sections are evaluated as the sum in quadrature of the uncertainties resulting from variations of the QCD scales, parton distribution functions, and \u03b1 s . The uncertainty in the tH cross section is calculated following the procedure of ref. [79]. The order of the theoretical calculations for the different production processes is also indicated. In the case of bbH production, the values are given for the mixture of five-flavour (5FS) and four-flavour (4FS) schemes recommended in ref. [74].",
