Here we however discuss only a subset of those results, focusing on searches for resonances decaying to gluon pairs, which rightfully belong to the class of diboson final states object of this review. While the signature of energetic quarks and gluons cannot be distinguished well enough to allow for an advantageous experimental categorization of dijet events as the result of the qq, qg, or gg final states, all models that predict the existence of a new particle undergoing X \u2192 gg decay foresee that the natural width \u0393 X is sizable. Due to the steep decrease of parton distribution functions as a function of Bjorken-x at large x values, the mass distribution of the resonance at particle level assumes a quite non-Gaussian shape, with long tails toward masses much smaller than m X . This peculiarity makes the search for gluon-pair resonances rather different from the search of generic narrow states decaying to jet pairs, and the result of the latter not usable to extract precise information on models predicting gg resonances.",
