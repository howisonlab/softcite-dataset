            "text": ". The data provide a strong constraint on the theoretical description of heavy quark transport in the QGP.  The \u2206\u03c6(HFE , h) correlation is measured for 4 < p h T < 6 GeV/c in two trigger electron p T intervals, 6 < p e T < 8 GeV/c and 8 < p e T < 10 GeV/c for two centralities, 0 \u2212 10% and 20 \u2212 50%, in Pb-Pb collisions at \u221a s NN = 2.76 TeV and in pp collisions at 7 TeV. Since the vacuum fragmentation of heavy quarks is not expected to be different in pp collisions at \u221a s = 7 and 2.76 TeV, the near-side yield in pp collisions at 7 TeV is used as reference. Figure 3 shows the \u2206\u03c6(HFE , h) in Pb-Pb and pp collisions after removing the pedestal defined between 1.5 < \u2206\u03c6 < 2 rad. To address a possible modification of the parton fragmentation function in the QCD medium, the near-side (\u2212\u03c0/2 < \u2206\u03c6 < \u03c0/2) per-trigger yield is measured in Pb-Pb collisions and compared with the yield in pp collisions to obtain I AA , defined as ratio of the per-trigger yields in pp and Pb-Pb [9]. As depicted in Figure 4, the I AA on the near-side is consistent with unity within the current uncertainties.   ",
