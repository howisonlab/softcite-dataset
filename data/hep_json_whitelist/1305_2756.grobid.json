III). The resulting uncertainties range from 10% of the t \" t background at low m t\" t to 20% at masses above 1 TeV. The PDF uncertainty on all Monte Carlo samples is estimated by taking the envelope of the MSTW2008NLO, NNPDF2.3 [80] and CT10 PDF set uncertainties at 68% confidence level [81] following the PDF4LHC recommendation [82] and normalizing to the nominal cross section. The PDF uncertainty has a much larger effect on the t \" t mass spectrum in the boosted sample than in the resolved sample, with variations in the number of t \" t events increasing from 5% at 1 TeV to over 50% above 2 TeV, due primarily to the larger relative PDF uncertainties in the higher-mass (higher partonic x) regime.

This is a hypothesis-testing tool that uses pseudoexperiments to search for local excesses or deficits in the data compared to the Standard Model prediction in binned histograms, taking the look-elsewhere effect into account over the full mass spectrum. The Standard Model prediction is allowed to float within the systematic uncertainties. After accounting for the systematic uncertainties, no significant deviation from the expected background is found. Upper limits are set on the cross section times branching ratio of the Z 0 and KK gluon benchmark models using a Bayesian technique, implemented in a tool developed by the D0 Collaboration [88]. The prior is taken to be constant in the signal cross section, which in this case is an excellent approximation of the reference prior that maximizes the amount of missing information [89], as given in Ref. [90]. The Bayesian limits are in good agreement with results obtained using the CL s method [91,92]. For each of the models investigated, 95% C.L. upper limits are set on the product of production cross section and branching ratio into t \" t pairs.",
