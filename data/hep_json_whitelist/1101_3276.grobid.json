A comparison of the expected resolutions calculated with Eq. 11 and measured values is given in Ref. [33]. Summaries and examples of performances achieved with gaseous tracking detectors like Drift, Jet or Time Projection Chambers are given in Refs. [20,32]. Typical values are 4.5 to 7.5%. By increasing the gas pressure, the resolution can be significantly improved, e.g. for the PEP TPC an energy resolution of below 3% was achieved at 8.5 bar.
