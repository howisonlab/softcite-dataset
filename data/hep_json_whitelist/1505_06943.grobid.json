The presence of soft QCD and re-scattering gives rise to the question, what is one testing with these decays. It is well known that some asymmetries can be manifestly non-zero driven solely by strong phase differences and hence do not provide clear insight into weak dynamics. The converse is also true for other asymmetries. If one considers a simple model of two interfering amplitudes it is straightforward to show that half of the asymmetries defined above fall into the former category and half into the latter one. Hence six of these quantities are interesting to measure from the perspective of the weak interaction even in the limit that we are unable to control hadronic contributions.",
