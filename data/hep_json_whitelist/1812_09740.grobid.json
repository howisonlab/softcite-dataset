The good modelling by MC simulations of the distribution shapes and the correlations of all input variables to the BDT is verified in the W Z jj\u2212QCD CR, as exemplified by the good description of the BDT score distribution of data in the W Z jj\u2212QCD CR shown in Fig. 1. The distribution of the BDT score in the W \u00b1 Z jj signal region is used to extract the significance of the W Z jj\u2212EW signal and to measure its fiducial cross-section via a maximum-likelihood fit. An extended likelihood is built from the product of four likelihoods corresponding to the BDT score distribution in the W \u00b1 Z jj SR, the m jj distribution in the W Z jj\u2212QCD CR, the multiplicity of reconstructed b-quarks in the b-CR and the m jj distribution in the Z Z -CR. The inclusion of the three control regions in the fit allows the yields of the W Z jj\u2212QCD, tt + V and Z Z jj\u2212QCD backgrounds to be constrained by data. The shapes of these backgrounds are taken from MC predictions and can vary within the uncertainties affecting the measurement as described in Section 8. The normalisations of these backgrounds are introduced in the likelihood as parameters, labelled \u03bc W Z jj\u2212QCD , \u03bc tt+V and \u03bc Z Z jj\u2212QCD for W Z jj\u2212QCD, tt + V and Z Z jj\u2212QCD backgrounds, respectively.",
