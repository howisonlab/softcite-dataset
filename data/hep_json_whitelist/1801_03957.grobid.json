The \u03c7 \u00b1 1 and \u03c7 0 2 are assumed to be mass-degenerate winos. The various curves show different assumptions on the masses of the squarks and gluinos, as described in the legend. The green band shows the theoretical uncertainty in the cross section calculation, from the variation of renormalization and factorization scales as well as parton density functions, for the 100 TeV squark and gluino mass assumption. Figure 3 shows the NLO cross section for \u03c7 \u00b1 1 \u03c7 0 2 production at \u221a s = 13 TeV assuming mass-degenerate winos \u03c7 \u00b1 1 and \u03c7 0 2 . The various curves show different assumptions on the masses of squarks ( q) and gluinos ( g), as described in the legend. The cross section depends significantly on the masses of the strongly coupled particles until they reach masses of at least 10 TeV. For the range of \u03c7 \u00b1 1 and \u03c7 0 2 masses considered here, the reduction can make up to 90% in the cross section value. This is due to large destructive interference effects from t-channel diagrams involving squark exchange. The cross section calculation used in the interpretations of the analysis results assumes a mass of 100 TeV for the squarks and gluinos to have them fully decoupled. The obtained results would be less stringent if lower masses were assumed for the squarks and gluinos. We performed the same study for",
