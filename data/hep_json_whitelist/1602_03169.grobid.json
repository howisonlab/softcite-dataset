For the signal selection, we use a boosted decision tree (BDT) [40] to take advantage of the correlations among variables that discriminate between signal and background; figure 2 illustrates how a pair of kinematic variables correlate differently for a background process and signal. Compared to the approach of ref. [12], the signal selection is characterized mainly by the use of new variables, and a systematic search for the most reduced set of best-performing variables to be used as input to the BDT. Furthermore, because the discriminating power of each input varies across the (m( t 1 ), m( \u03c7 0 1 )) mass plane, the latter is partitioned and a unique BDT is trained in each partition. The full list of variables (not all used in every BDT) is given below:",
