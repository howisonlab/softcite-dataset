This means that the lepton number changes by 3N CS , since each of three leptons produced has absolute lepton number of 1. The baryon number will also change by 3N CS because each quark has an absolute baryon number of 1/3 and there are three colors and three generations of quarks produced. This results in two important relations, which are essential to the phenomenology of sphalerons: \u2206(B + L) = 6N CS and \u2206(B \u2212 L) = 0. The anomaly only exists if there is enough energy to overcome the potential in N CS , which is fixed by the values of the EW couplings. Assuming the state at 125 GeV to be the SM Higgs boson, the precise measurement of its mass [21,22] allowed the determination of these couplings, giving an estimate of the energy required for the sphaleron transitions of E sph \u2248 9 TeV [44,48].",
